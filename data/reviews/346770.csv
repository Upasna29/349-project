"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XmiseryX/recommended/346770/","XmiseryX","Misery","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XmiseryX/","382 products in account","So I bought this game after having been drawn to it by the retro look (those tilesets are freaking brilliant, particularly the ZZT-esque "Sweeney" one) and the obvious Boulderdash-ish puzzle nature of the game.\n\nI had exactly one issue pop up that was a problem, but the dev very quickly pointed out how to fix it; seems like the helpful sort of developer that actually cares enough to stick around and assist if needed, as opposed to some devs that just drop the game, and vanish into the ether... so that's a plus right there.\n\nBut after that, smooth sailing so far, and I was able to get into the meat of the game.\n\nNow the game is labeled as an "arcade" style game in the description, but this definitely is heavily focused on the puzzle aspect.  Figuring out just how to manipulate all of those boulders and such in order to get to where you want to go is a huge part of the game.  Most of the time, you can approach this at your own pace, and stop and think if you need to.  You dont need to rush.  And there are some gizmos you can buy that'll allow you to further manipulate the level in order to dig deeper, as sometimes the rocks will be piled up in such a way that you cant get by them by just pushing them or digging.  Learning to use these is an important part of the game, and it surprised me as to just how much they add to it.  Though I havent tried all of them yet.\n\nThere are though also some areas that will contain monsters... as you can probably guess, you dont want to touch these.  In those situations, you might have to be ready to move quickly, so you cant ALWAYS proceed at a slow pace.  You can take these guys out by dropping rocks on them, or use the laser gun, or you can try to block them into secluded areas.   Whatever you do, they are definitely a threat, so you need to be careful around them.\n\nWhich brings me to the other bit:  The game is PUNISHING.  This is a permadeath game.  You die, that's it, you lose.... no saving and reloading or any of that nonsense.  There IS a way to buy extra lives (called "drones" in-game), but they're very expensive, and you dont start out with any of them.  Most of the time, you get crushed by a boulder or something like that, and BAM, that's it, you're gone.  One hit KO!    And you will die.... over and over and over.  It's not uncommon to have a run that lasts like, 30 seconds.  Or to have one where you're deep in there, you've been going at it for an hour, going for the big points/money and then.... BAM, made a mistake, and rocks happened, and.... yeah, that's it.  There IS an "easy" mode, which I think does things a bit differently (havent tried it myself) but the game is really designed to be played in the normal way.   It definitely seems targeted towards the sort of player that enjoys things like roguelikes, or games like Spelunky with brutal difficulty, quick deaths, and having to start from the very beginning if you lose.\n\nAnd what really makes things interesting is that there's a definite "greed" aspect to the game.  This one really seems to be designed to be played for a high score... get as much money as you can before finishing (and of course there's a scoreboard to record your best scores, and there are "daily" runs to do as well).  ALL THE TIME, the game will be taunting you with shiny things that you definitely want, but that are in dangerous places, or areas that are hard to get to, or that appear downright inaccessible.  And so you'll go after these things (possibly with some equipment in hand), and you'll take the risk because you want the shiny things, and.... BAM!  Oops, you're dead.  But it's very satisfying to successfully get tons of things out of a dangerous area, particularly as you go deeper and deeper into the quarries.\n\nThe screenshots in the store show what looks like just a single room/screen/board/whatever, but there's actually alot of them, and you'll have access to a bunch of them right from the start (by running off to the left or right at the top).  And there'll be passages that can then lead downwards into even more areas, provided you find a way to get there while not being dead.  So there's a ton of places to explore, and it's all randomly generated.\n\n\nAll in all, I'm so far very much enjoying this one.  I'm probably going to be playing this one pretty frequently... it's definitely my sort of game.  It wont be for everyone, as the difficulty will definitely turn some people away... but if you like the sorts of games that I do, if you like a challenge, and so on.... then definitely buy this one.  Highly recommended and a very pleasant surprise to suddenly find on Steam.","April 23, 2015","true","16.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","17","18","2","0"

Runs can last from 5 seconds to 2 hours if you want to get really in depth, but if you have some experience with the game I feel most runs go for around 30 minutes to an hour. The game can be very terrifying, I have even jumped from time to time from a death that seemingly came out of no where. One mistep I can assure you will be your last, but making all the right moves and succeeding is one of the most rewarding feelings Ive ever gotten out of a video game.\n\nIn closing I cannot reccommend this game enough.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/recommended/346770/","MartyrA2J","MartyrA2J","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/","557 products in account","Quarries of Scred is an object lesson in greed. The more shiny rocks you collect, the closer you are to certain death. In the game you play a poor, hopeless, soul who has been banished to the quarries to pay for his debt. In the quarries you will find all sorts of randomly generated treasure to collect and spend. There are also many, many dangers, mostly in the form of falling rocks, and some moving enemies. The basic gist of Scred is that it's a puzzle game. A very easy to lose and frustrating puzzle game. As you go about mining and collecting gems and treasure, the quarries will shift depending on your actions. Move the wrong dirt block and suddenly you have a avalanche on your hands. Breach the wrong path and suddenly enemies are swarming all over you. Oh did I mention you die in one hit?\n\nNow I can hear you saying, "Wow, it doesn't look that hard. Just got to pay attention."\n\nYou would be correct. However the quarries are sadistic in nature. Rocks block your path and must be navigated or enemies destroyed. Just past that seemingly innocent rock is a mountain of shiny treasure. One that could push your high score or help you win the game. However it hardly is ever innocent. I guess the best thing I could say, is it's easier said then actually done.\n\nWell,  just take a look at one of the quarries. Tell me if that looks easy to navigate.\n\nYeah, and that is just one quarry. They are randomly generated, multi-layered as well. Sometimes offering even great rewards for going deeper. Now let's pretend after dying 50 times, you get the idea of the game and actually start making a dent into the quarries. (True story on my part.) What does one spend his hard earned cash on? Well the ultimate goal is to leave and win the game. However you can divert some of your cash into buying tech that can give you an advantage. There are lasers, mines, gravity inverters, just to name a few of the items. All of these can be used tactically to turn the tables on quarries.\n\nSuddenly winning the game isn't the main goal anymore. The high-score is your true enemy. Beat the game as fast as possible, with as much loot as possible. This is the staple of the game and what makes it entertaining. You've got to be fast. You've got to be smart.\n\nFrom a technical aspect, Quarries of Scred is simply designed but well designed. There are some extra game modes thrown into the mix, ranging from time attack games, to dark mode, where you cannot see anything in the mine and must use flares to light the way. Every day there is a new daily challenge that is shared amongst players to see who can attain the highest score. This must be checked through the website sadly, not through the game. All of these add already to the heap of replay value Scred has.\n\nThe look of Scred is something that may draw you in, if you love retro inspired graphics and minimalistic pixel work. On the other hand, it may turn you off completely from the game. I for one have never been a fan of ASCII artwork, mostly due to personal preference. None of that really matters though because Scred comes with a whole selection of graphical styles and choices. These let you choose what flavor and style you want to play the game in.\n\nJust as the games visuals are inspired by retro old school games, the music and sound effects are as well. While the music tracks are just fine, there are some sound effects that become grating on the ears as they repeat over and over. Not all the sound effects are bad though. Just expect chiptunes. Any fan of retro games will more then likely be happy with what they hear. If not, blast your own music and mine away.\n\nI haven't met many games that have such a rewarding but harsh nature to them. Scred is incredibly fun and replayable. At the same time though, I raged quit a few times. This was due to my inability and not taking the time to plan out what I was going to do. Completing a quarry or beating the game is a truly satisfying experience. One that is hard to describe after all that frustration. Like I mentioned earlier, the game has oodles of replay value. Albeit it isn't the worlds most groundbreaking, innovating puzzle game, its mechanics work very well. It brings back a retro inspired brutality that games sometimes lack during these times. However the game never cheats you. If you die, it is always your fault. It shows what you did wrong and expects you to do better. Games don't do that these days. Most of the time hand feeding you or giving you a bread crumb trail of what to do next instead.\n\nWith a fantastic price, fun gameplay and plenty of mining to be done, bang for your buck is guaranteed with Quarries of Scred. Things like controller support, steam achievements are all cherries on top of this evil sundae.","June 16, 2015","true","1.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

Not the best game by a long shot but clever in what it does. The only down side is the lack of instructions (even after readin the online manual) it does not tell you what the different items do that you can purchase, or how to use them. The game is 'like' Boulder Dash but harder. The rocks cause instant death if you push the dirt away from under them. The different Retro Styled looks to the game is what made me buy it, and they work great. Nice game to play for 10 minutes or so.","January 28","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Get too comfortable and you WILL mess up, followed by sharp shouts of "DOH!" and self-inflicted facepalms. Money is collected by digging dirt, and mining gems and other resources, all while avoiding getting squashed or squashing valuables. I'm oversimplifying but careful planning is rewarded. It's a hard but addictive good time. Great little game. If this had been released in 1986 for IBM clones and the C-64, today it would be fondly remembered as a classic.","February 6","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It plays out like you're controlling a classic Roguelike character on a grid-based level. You collect as much gems as you can however you have to be careful where you dig or else a boulder will crush you. So, each move is literally like a chess move. You have to be careful where you're digging at. And each level is completely different since it is procedurally generated. I definitely recommend even at full price. A steal if it's on sale.

You have to manage your pace so you wont miss any easy traps. Great risk vs reward.\n\nIt might be too little of a game for some, and the graphics are ugly as sin.

It's endlessly replayable. It's especially fun to compete against friends in the Daily Quarry, which you're only allowed to attempt once per day.\n\nWhenever you die, it's 100% your fault. You'll see some gems you want to excavate, formulate a plan on how to reach them, and if you don't mess it up you'll walk away with the treasure. I can't overstate how enjoyable it is to clear a Quarry with as many gems as you risk collecting, and managing to get out of there with a high score and your life intact.\n\nOne of my favourite indie games, highly recommended.","December 23, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is a nice variety of tilesets that you can switch to, I've played with the C64 tileset and it definitely gives me nostalgic feelings. Is there anything more than that? I think so, it's a solid puzzle game in the style of old arcade games. It's got a good blend of tension and strategy, and of course those moments where you kick yourself for making the wrong move.\nThere is a bit of the obscurity that those old games are known for though, for example I had to hop on the forums to find out the keybindings, and the help menu in game is very simplistic. Those are nitpicks though, this is a deceptively simple game that works really well at what it set out to be. I think it's worth a look if you want something quick and engaging to play in your downtime.","September 16, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But, to me it's just got a number of little issues that added up to a 'not fun' game overall for me...\nPROS:+ 80's Balderdash feel\n+ Quick 'n simple world, game, controls\n+ Multiple dig maps next to each to choose from in one randomly generated game world\n\nMEH:~ I don't get any desire to really go get the difficult diamonds/treasure just because of how the slightest tap of a key for a split second simply ends your game out right.\n\nCONS:- Windowed only?  I get it, it's "retro", but we still can't make it full screen, or at least larger than a tiny window?  (If you enlarge the screenshots above on the store page, those seem to be 100% views of the game screen)\n\n- Seems to be next-to-no animation.  Rocks fall at almost the speed of light in this game.  It'd be nice to see the avalanche let loose.\n\n- Instant death / game-over by the slightest wrong tap of a key.  No matter how fast you jump into a spot and jump back -- dead.  If there's something that can fall on you, the game simply goes to the Game Over screen with no animation of your action.\n\nIn short, what seems to be my main fun-sapping-problem with the game is the idea of... "One life.  Zero health.  Make no mistakes."And to me, that doesn't make for a fun, casual, arcade game.  But looking at the reviews I'm in the vast minority.  Ahh well.  I love the idea of the game, just not this implementation.  Sorry.","May 18","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
