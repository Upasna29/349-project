The puzzle mechanics are unique and although they rely on one specific mechanic, the additional elements keep up the challenge and introduce new ways of thinking into every new level visited.\n\nSo why the negative review?\nBecause this particular *puzzle* game relies heavily on twitch reflexes. A puzzle game should be something you play to use your brain, not your shooter skills and hand-eye coordination. And this plagues the vast majority of the game, including each and every bonus level. Sadly, after a time (and lots and lots of resets on one level because you just missed the strict time limit) all the fun and challenge turns into nothing but pure frustration and anger, which is a clear indicator when a game fails to be a game.\n\nThe main levels are worth a few bucks for the design and the utterly charming narrative that tells a funny, yet somewhat bittersweet story, but for hardcore puzzle gamers and achievement hunters I advise against buying this title.","July 15, 2014","false","6.8"," 45 of 72 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","45","72","0","5"

While the mechanics are easy to learn, the game quickly becomes complex when you have to coordinate the movements of multiple recorded copies of yourself which you can interact with in order to finish levels as quickly and with as few recordings as possible.\n\nWhile I played the majority of the game a long time ago, I just finished it up today and found it easy to pick back up and get into.

Winterbottom is truly born of Braid. It's all about time manipulation puzzles. But there's none of the somber pretentiousness of Braid. This game is a bit silly, with a frenetic soundtrack of ragtime-style piano and clarinet. I like the presentation of this game.\n\nBut if the presentation is a bit silly, there's no silly in the challenge. The puzzles are hard, and they appear to exist only for the sake of existing; there's no great story or adventure here, just level after level of increasingly difficult time-bending puzzles.\n\nP.B. Winterbottom's greatest achievement is achieving a price tag of $0.49 during the 2010 Steam Holiday sale. I don't imagine that, years later, people are hanging on for another big 90% off sale for this game. But if you enjoy puzzle games, this is not a bad buy.","May 19, 2013","true","1.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/recommended/40930/","MakoSipper","MakoSipper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/","3807 products in account","THE PIE IS NOT A LIE!\n\nShort Verdict: A good puzzle game, despite its flaws. Requires you to think fast, too. Last but not least, it's cheap.\n\nOverview: The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom is basically a puzzle game in which you control Winterbottom to create and manage clones in some sort of time controlling mechanics in order to collect all pies in each level. Although it's a puzzle game in essence, you'll also need a bit of dexterity and precision in some levels.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful 2D graphics with a lot of personality\nGreat BGM, perfect for the setting of the game\nIf I counted right, there are 50 main story levels, plus 30 challenges\nMost of the puzzles are smart and rewarding when you figure them out\nThe level hints sometimes provide a slight help, but they don't spoonfeed you--they really hit the mark\nEven the clones characteristics and the conditions for being able to collect pies change between the 5 sets of levels, adding a lot to the puzzles\nCons:\nEven though my computer runs modern games with no problems, Winterbottom lagged in some levels (my pc told me something about the color scheme, but I didn't try changing it)\nThe learning curve is messy--the first set of levels is ridiculously easy, then the second quickly becomes insanely hard, and after that it finally hits the mark. Seems to me like lack of planning or of proper tutorials, and I almost threw the towel on the second set of levels.\nI personally hate it when a puzzle game requires ridiculous precision and perfect movements--puzzle games should be about thinking hard enough, not attempting the same thing over and over again until you just find the perfect spot and the perfect timing\nSome of the main levels (and quite a few challenges) are uninspired and just plain boring to play. I have to mention the very first challenge level, which is probably one of the most stupid ones and almost made me give up on all challenges. Make sure you try at the least a few of the other challenges.\nBought on: Steam Store for R$ 1,99 (US$ 1.24 on the US store at the same time).\n\nVerdict: All things considered, it's a good puzzle game. Yes, it has some flaws and can be infuriating sometimes. Just keep in mind that this is NOT a zen puzzle game and you'll be required to move quickly and think fast all the time. But most of the game is fun, especially if you consider how much I've payed for it. It's also worth its full price, I think.\n\nSimilar games: People call it a clone from Braid, which I haven't played, so I guess they probably have their similarities. I could also say it slightly reminds me of Toki Tori, for the puzzle solving and the ability to control time.","January 14, 2015","true","7.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","1"

I've played games like this before, where you had to use the cloning mechanic to have a copy of you at the right place at the right time in order to collect all the doo-dads and reach the exit door. But this game puts a damper on the fun by arbitrarily restricting how many copies you can make in each puzzle, and by requiring you to execute the solution to the puzzle in a strict target time set by the developers (i.e. the pies disappear if you don't gather them fast enough). The time-limit problem is only compounded by adding timed doors/switches into the mix. Finally, the game requires you to strike your clones to launch them at high/far pies, but once you strike them, it breaks them out of their loop, so they disappear. This means if you are trying to execute on a puzzle that requires striking a clone, and you don't pull it off, you have to set up all of your clones again. So yet another puzzle game that requires you to reset a puzzle to its start position over and over and over again when you ALREADY KNOW THE SOLUTION and are JUST TRYING TO EXECUTE IT. Irritating.\n\nAlso, while I like the art / atmosphere of the levels, the constant cinematic cuts/intros are interruptive.\n\nWant to play a game that uses this exact same mechanic, but doesn't have all of the annoyances, is way more fun, and is absolutely free? Search for a browser-based game named "Chronotron". You're welcome.\n\nmeh/10","April 26, 2015","false","1.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

In this title you must steal all the pies while being as much of a lying sack of PB than you can be. You moustache your face off with all of the time traveling ♥♥♥♥ just like in back to the future damn I want to bang that chick but marty is super homosexual. And it is sort of like back 2 the future where martys mom is all ugly and fat and married to that hunk biff, then I got confusing feelings. Then there was back 3 the future where ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doc got a waifu that was pretty annoying and then they went on a train and then doc got ♥♥♥♥♥whipped into having several time kids and then traveled through time ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ up and then he turned into pb winterbottom. It is kind of sad how much this game reminds me of point break because you kind of play as keeanu reeves and patrick swayze and that one part where the guy throws his fbi badge into the ocean for some reason. I dont remember seeing point break actually. Just like I dont remember playing pb winterbottom and the goblet of ♥♥♥♥ but apperrantly I did play it for a long time. Does anyone actually know how to beat the first level btway because I was confused as how to make antoehr winterbottom. I was stuck with one winterbottom and it was terrible but I really appreciated the astchedeteetics of the game and the sound design of the characters. I liked the part in the game where you use the attack dog to kill people and i think at some point you had fish move out of the way with advanced ai and then at the end of the game you blow up russia, china, and everywhere that isnt america and then you find out that in fact you were also russian and at the end of the game you have to either shoot the good russian guy or the bad russian guy or yourself and then you get an ending based off that but it is super ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and it turns out that the good russian guy was actually bad too and took over the world or some ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tass ♥♥♥♥ and then you play the intro of the game again but the one dude calls you comrade and then I was like "♥♥♥♥ this videogame" and then you see the statue of the good guy. Oh and at the credits you see that one chick that had no character development come up out the water and then she is alive in the past or the future or something. Anyways sorry for rambling so much but overall Stranglehold was an allright game, you get to slow mo shoot guys in the ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThis game gets a 9/11 ( too soon but that is the joke is taht i winterbottomed my way into the future to say that joke when it is not too soon after 9/11 but it wasnt really a joke it was just the game's score)","November 25, 2013","true","8.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

They start with simple levels to get you used to the principles you need to use in the game. These are  relatively boring but necessary to get to the fun levels where you apply what you have learnt to solve the puzzles. However these then give way to the really frustrating levels that are difficult to solve and offer little in the way of enjoyment. This means that the actual enjoyable part of the game is a tiny minority of the game. This game is quite stylish and somewhat reminiscent of Braid, I personally find that game an anathema but if you liked it you might well like this.","December 13, 2011","false","3.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I like the mechanics.  The problem is that they are underexplored.  They have the potential for some very intricate and sophisticated puzzles which we frankly never see.  The game is too simple and too easy.  Even after beating the game and unlocking the "challenge" levels, we find that the challenge is not in unraveling a complex puzzle, but in completing an easy puzzle quickly / efficiently.  This is of course a worthwhile inclusion, but I would also have liked to see some challenges that are difficult from the thought side rather than the execution side.","December 29, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For its message may indeed call into question the most fundamental beliefs we hold dear in our modern capitalist society. Indeed the insightful metaphorical commentary about the conditions of the proletariat under the USSR are some of the most powerful arguments for the differing virtues of communism and socialist economic policies versus the greed driven capitalist system. Naturally the "pie"; the object of P.B.s never ending pursuit represents wealth and stature which will never be achieved by those born into poverty. The fact that the glorious pie will never be attained highlights the tragic situation many of the working class find themselves in. Forced to work in mundane tedium until death, how many people have only their pensions to think of keeping them going?

Winterbottom -PC-\n\nThe Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom is the “Dr. Seus” of 2D platform gaming. It plays well, it has a fun “indie” artistic style, and it narrative overlay is cleaver and witty. While it lasts, these misadventures are a great fun, unfortunately I plowed through this game is just a couple short hours. I would have liked to have seen a full scale adventure, but for what you pay for, it is well worth it.\n\nIn the game your objective is to try to get your character (who is a mix between Yogi Bear and Scrooge Mcduck) to collect all the pies on the screen.  The premise sounds simple, but it will soon become apparent that some of these pies are tricky sons of a gun to collect.\n\nThe levels are separated into sets of levels. At the beginning of a set, the game will introduce to you a new game mechanic, and for the rest of the levels collecting pies will be become increasingly more complex. Collecting pies has never been this hard before! The game mechanics are fresh and intuitive. I will not give any of the game mechanics away, for it would ruin the whole mystique. The new game  mechanics really set The Misadventures of Mr. Winterbottom apart from other generic puzzle side scrollers. I applaud the high standard of creativity.\n\nAlmost every puzzle is set in a static screen, there won’t actually be much side scrollin’ action in this game, only in the later levels you’ll be able to side scroll. I think this was because of the nature of these puzzles. They can get really tricky, and it is helpful to have the whole puzzle right in front of you at all times. I do prefer the classic side scroller, and many times the levels in this game felt like a puzzle level from “Tetris Attack” or “Yoshi’s Cooke”, I still enjoyed it.\n\nAs you run around as Mr Winterbottom, he controls reasonably well. He is not perfectly precise, but you rarely if ever will be punished for not being exact; your objective is to collect pies and as long as any part of you guy touches a pie, you’ll collect it.  The whole game is based on puzzles and not perfectly executed maneuvering (even though some levels trick you into thinking so)\n\nThe story and narrative are reminiscent of popular children books. The phrasing rhymes, and come 2 lines at a time. There are still pictures that accompany every described location. I looked forward to the narrative as it came and I read and enjoyed every line.\n\nThe only real problem with The Misadventures of Mr. Winterbottom is that it is too short. I completed the game fully in less than 4 hours. Given, I am a wizard of sorts, but there just isn’t as much content as I would have liked. I can’t really complain cause I got the game for like $5 off of a Steam sale.\n\nThe Misadventures of Mr. Winterbottom is a great diversion with plenty of re play-ability: weather it be in attempts to get a better score / time or to watch someone else solve the puzzles for the first time, it is plenty of fun. I have suggested this game to a number of people, as I think it can be fun for a very broad # of people. Go and play you some Mr Winterbottom!\n\nWritten September 2010 for website allgamesplayed given a 4 out of 5\n","February 11","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However more can play at that game, especially when you decide to go off your rocker with time and clones all in the pursuit of the pinnacle of primal desires...Pie!\n\nYes, the great quest of Mr. Winterbottom is the pursuit of pie, regardless of the consequences of Bakersburg or spacetime, as you make your way through puzzles after a mysterious mystical pie. You duplicate yourself to satisfy your gluttony, but as you play, you must satisfy that of your clones too to proceed, much to your dismay.

Time's been conquered, cerebral symbolism that only Blow knows bombarded the chances of others, or so it might seem! However more can play at that game, especially when you decide to go off your rocker with time and clones all in the pursuit of the pinnacle of primal desires...Pie!\n\nYes, the great quest of Mr. Winterbottom is the pursuit of pie, regardless of the consequences of Bakersburg or spacetime, as you make your way through puzzles after a mysterious mystical pie. You duplicate yourself to satisfy your gluttony, but as you play, you must satisfy that of your clones too to proceed, much to your dismay. With the ever-increasing complexity of your pie predicaments, the game almost begins to feel a little finicky, but the solutions remain satisfying to figure out, and rarely leave you perplexed.\n\nThe cream atop this curiosity? A distinct visual style and cheerful soundtrack to keep you intrigued and entertained as you try to gather every last pie and incidentally resolve other situations in Bakersburg at the same time. The game's story isn't terribly fascinating, but the writing is fairly amusing at times. If I had to guess, I think there are a few spots that suggest the origin of Mr. Winterbottom tucked away into the tale, and if correct, it works surprisingly well to explain the perpetual misadventures of Mr. Winterbottom.","February 24, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of those that can get lost if you aren't familiar with games from a few years ago. This one slipped by a lot of people, but it still is very much worth checking out. It has a vintage look that will remind one of old cartoons and films from days gone by. The in-game dialogues are done in rhyme and come off as quite likeable considering the material, much like Child of Light in comparison. The platforming and control of character is adequately precise with a DS4 controller. Visuals are basically perfect for the time periods and styles they are trying to provoke, and I personally much prefer this tone of game to Braid, another time puzzler. Gameplay here involves using clones and recording time to conventiently work your way through various contraptions and pie dreams. Altogether short but extremely well made.","January 11","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
