I did miss the satisfying beeps products being scanned... so I paid money to do my old job without actually getting paid for it. At least now I can swear at those moody turds without the fear of getting fired.","September 26, 2015","true","8.8"," 63 of 72 people (88%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","88","63","72","53","1"

Me neither. Yet, this game attracted me because I may have seen an educational side to it. That's why I activated the link offered in a bundle on itch.io and that's why the game is in my steam library too.\n\nSo, you bet that your job is to scan products and to put them in the bag while making sure that nothing get crushed because of the weight. Also, you greet people, you take their Shoppy Mart card if they have one, coupons if they have one, etc.. And for fruit and vegetable and seasonal items (Halloween, Christmas for now, I suppose we'll get Easter and bunny chocolate), you have to enter a product code that you can see by pressing SHIFT and your numpad.\n\nThat's the core of the game: the more you do levels the more xp you collect and you can unlock new customers like the Stoner, the Pringles look-a-like, the Hobo, etc... Besides, thanks to the weight now shown on the cash register, you can finally avoid more crushing bags and loose a customer. Because after 5 lost, you're fired and you're going to start again the game at first day.\n\nAnyway, don't worry for the money you need to give back to the customer if they're paying with money instead of a credit card, you have the right number shown and what you still have to give.\n\nAnd the game is mainly put into a world where everything is a parody: from the credit cards, to the memo given by your boss to the customers.\n\nAnother little thing: I've spoken about the game as if you had your time for each customer.... because I played it in Easy and that I'll wait until launching me in Normal where you have a timer and that greeting, asking for the card, coupons, scanning them, etc.., is buying you time.\n\nShoppy Mart is a fun game, even if in the end, the educational side isn't present (unless to see the difference between weights or if giving back money is also interesting). Pezomi, the developer, is present and answering you when you have bugs (like I had with achievements unlocking out of the blue, the game freezing because of a disappearing receipt or money or game that didn't launch anymore correctly).\n\nSo yeah, for the price, you have a little good game!","February 1","true","11.4"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","18","22","5","0"

Cuz it's good to spend time but nothing more.\n\nIt have loads of bugs. But dev has released an update yestarday, I guess there will be more updates.\n\nPros :\n\n+ An cashier simulator!\n+ Barcode codes.\n+ Bag weight system (Physics...)\n+ Unlockable customers\n+ Handbook is your friend\n\nCons :\n\n- Difficult to understand at beginning. Handbook won't help you enough. (Espicially item's weight and bag system)\n- Many items don't have barcode codes.\n- Handbook is that not clear.\n- Very simple game for this price tag.\n\nFeedback :\n\nUpgrade handbook, add much more items and barcode codes. Money exchange system is not that bad, so pass it.\nI don't finish the game yet. But it's simple. If you look the other similar games (like Paper's Please) they are more complicated. You would earn money and make it useful for yourself and your company.\n\nAdd an hardcore mode. For example... Hardcore mode contains no handbook and shift mode. So you have to memorize barcode codes (or write them on a paper page :p), but it would be much more faster.\n\nThis game needs more variations indeed. People should give back items, want their money back. Or there should be giveaway and lotteries.\n\nScore : 57/100\n\nAn simple, enjoyable -casual- game. Good for spending a little time. But not enough for a real simulation experience (Ikr, it's an indie and nearly low budget game)","September 26, 2015","true","3.9"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","24","38","0","0"

Graphics are old school BUT that is made up in many ways.\n\n*Customers are unique and each have their own personality, and it's just awesome when some come in the store saying "grumple grumple" and are in a bad mood..this makes it fun and adds it's own personal touch.\n\n*Easy mode for those who do not like to be pressured with a time limit\n\n*New items unlock as you play..as well as your choice of a new customer.\n\n*Christmas theme update from the dev is nice, but I hope it gets replaces soon as it's getting old fast. But it's nice to see the game still being updated\n\nCON'S:\n\nThere aren't really too many..but there are some.\n\n*No save function..there is a save/load button but it only loads the last day you were playing, it will not save. And a few times it has actually started my game over.\n\n\n*Controls are not smooth. For a game that is in it's final phase I would think most bugs would be gone..however browsing the forum to post about MY issue, I see nothing but error posts from other people. For example, picking up items sometimes takes a few times before it actually works, same for dropping in the bag, sometimes it's annoying that it just falls on the counter when you clearly had the bag open when you dropped it. Trying to put money into the register or handing the receipt to customers most times takes a few tries..and it isn't that I am doing it wrong, because sometimes when handing the bag of groceries to customer it completely gets stuck in mid air. This can be a huge issue when playing in normal mode and you're down to the last 5 seconds before the customer gets mad and you get a strike..after I think 5 strikes it's game over, period.\n\n\nOverall the game is a nice one..and the dev is still updating it. I def reccomend this game 9/10","January 1","true","25.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"
