Anyways this game has pretty good music, a good variety of characters, and very good art. Don't let the boobs scare some of you from not buying this game because its not just about boobs, the levels can be extremely frustating and it may seem impossible at times. There's also youtube videos that will help you greatly should you be stuck in some parts or if you're not sure what to do next. Mulitplayer isn't the best but I've had some people help me out with getting through some tough parts which I'm glad they did or else I would have been stuck there for a while so it's an ok in my book. Another neat thing about this game is that you are able to change the picture in the background using your own pictures or someone else's.  To wrap this up I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of platformers or boobs and I expect great things from the devs in the future.","February 22","true","28.2"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","75","21","28","11","0"

So navigating to where the last chest is, is not easy and normally you are left with a checkpoint so you can try the chest.\nHowever this culmination of all your hard effort is awarded with no check point (which means getting that last chest is a huge ammount of effeort just to get to it's "cave" let alone the chest itself) and a "joke" from the developers.\n\nIt's as if they thought that for all your effort, frustration and anger you deserve to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off one last time. To save you the effort and spoil the ending, the last two levels show a anime girl icon, but when you finish the level one is a womans body with a fish head and the very last and most difficult level is a female body with a scruffy man's face.\n\nSo what the dev's are saying is "thanks for your money and all your effort is a waste."\n\nVery dissapointing game with a very dissapointing ending.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n/!\ WARNING! /!\\nThis recommendation is 0.1% away from not being recommended.\n----------------------\n\nThis game is a excersize in frustration. To begin with it's early access and that means it's not "finished". As of today 31/12/2015 it is still in Early access and I'm very close to NOT recommending the game.\nThe problem comes in with the games level of precision needed in later levels. You have to be super accurate while the game itself is not 100% coded. This is where the frustrations come in.\nAs an example. Eirene's level at the end is a great example of how frustrating this game can be. At the end you need to navigate a small, laval filled hallway with the odd rocket that can kill you thrown into the mix. The rockets seek you out and the small blocks you can land on are way too small. I began by saying that it's probably just me getting frustrated at the game and I'm seeing things. But fact was that the collision detection is a bit wonkey. Take-off's from standstill sometimes work great. Other times you land and do a quick take off and you shoot to the left or right faster than you are used to. Hitting the edge of the blocks pinball you sometimes into the lava.\n\nHowever the worst problem with the game is the "jitter".\n\nThe "jitter" is when the game seems to skip a frame. It's a very small problem and a miniscule problem starting out with the game, but in later levels that 1 frame skip is super deadly.\n\nOk ok... so all that sounds bad, but I'd still say give it a shot. The game is very fun in the beginning and if it stayed like that there would not be a challenge. But the end game does step over that line very quickly.\n\nAh yes... the topic of the "artwork". Look there are dime a dosen games like this. Take your character from point A to B through a difficult maze. Or if it's the trying over and over again thing you can play Darksouls. From a marketing standpoint this is a great idea. Skandily clad female anime characters are the next best thing to the obvious other that sells very well. However then this game would not make it to steam. (NOTE: you can make your own levels and swop out artworks.) If you just want the pictures you can google them I'm sure. Trust me, after about 5 levels the picture is the last thing you're thinking about or looking at. If the pictures are the reason you are not buying the game then don't be a prude.\n\nI had alot of fun in the beginning, but the later levels just seriously ruin the experiance with the level of precision needed to finish them. However I'm just happy enough to recommend it. For now...","December 31, 2015","false","12.3"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","0"

All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I review games that I like!═══════════════════════════════════INTRODUCTION\nUncraft World is a retro style puzzle platformer made by Team Shuriken. This game is a piece of art. I'm not talking about the boobs gag, they are appreciated, but, the level design is incredible and the game keeps bringing in new obstacles and traps through the whole game. The game starts out really easy and gets progressively harder by each level you pass, thankfully you can choose to play multiple levels from the beginning. One thing I'm really not happy about is the ability to turn down the music volume (you can mute the music from  the pause menu while you are playing level and you can't do this while you are in the main menu),  the soundtrack is good, it changes itself throught the game and provides a great atmosphere but sometimes you just need a little bit less of it. You can also encounter some bugs like being unable to start a level or loot not appearing back after you die with it. The game also has buggy built in level creator (that shuts the game when you open it) which I tried experimenting with and can see a lot of potential in it and that Steam Workshop page of this game will be full of unique levels. Graphics are pretty retro and since this is a 2D game set in 3D world you will have problems jumping on the right block if there are  other blocks behind it.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/339910\n\n═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONS\nPros:Amazing level design\nAwesome soundtrack\nNon-repetitive levels\nLevel Editor\nOnline multiplayer\nCharacter Unlocking\nSuitable for Speedrunning\nBoobsCons:Music is too loud and you can't turn it down\nYou can modify sounds only from pause menu\nMinor bugs\nSome levels will make you rage too much\nSometimes you will hear the sound when you hit ground but your meter won't be filled\nGame will seem like its frozen while loading═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nIf you like hard fun platformer games and boobs this is a ideal game for you. I rate this game 8.5/10, would play again.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════For more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curtations here!","October 11, 2015","true","4.1"," 25 of 44 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","25","44","6","0"

Totally different game.\n\nThis is a side platformer obstacle course in super meatboy style play, minecraft looking levels and characters, pulsing upbeat soundtrack, anime wallpapers, and a voiceover on death that yells profanities so you don't have to.  These things make no sense to combine together in one game.  So they did.\n\nYou'll use only three keys, or 2 and the left mouse click, to navigate your way through levels to hit checkpoints, which will gradually "un-craft" the world behind you, revealing scantily clad cartoon ladies.\n\nGameplay starts easy and gets very challenging.  Play time per level ranges from a couple minutes to a half-hour.\n\nMultiplayer is well integrated -- essentially it's just like solo-play but if either of you hits a checkpoint you can both use it.  And you get to suffer the gauntlet together which is always nice.\n\nThe art is tasteful and well done.  A lot of it is actually quite beautifully painted.  If anime girls aren't your thing, there's an option to replace with any image you want.\n\nThere is a level builder but I haven't tried it yet.\n\nIn summary, I was gifted this and had zero expectation that it would be any good.  Blown away by how fun and challenging it is. 10/10","May 2","true","13.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

So, you could imagine my happiness when I found this game had finally been ported to Steam.\n\nI have found that the game plays easier when using a game controller, like that for the Xbox One.  I would not recommend using a keyboard to play this game, or you will find yourself having a much harder time controlling your character, thus causing you to die multiple times, and not beat the level until 20-30 minutes later.\n\nHowever, I have noticed a major bug in this game.  When I am playing a session of this game, the game will crash unexpectedly.  This has happened multiple times without warning.  Since this game is still in early access, I can understand that there are bugs that could crash the game.  So I call upon Team Shuriken to fix them as soon as possible.\n\nOverall, despite some bugs needing fixing and heightened difficulty when playing with a keyboard instead of a game controller, I find this game to be very enjoyable, especially with the added challenge of finding treasure chests.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenging platformer to play.  Keep up the good work, guys!","March 12","true","9.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The games are not always the problem, whether it be because of poor level design or pesky combat rotations. The issue seems to be with how well people can handle death on a repeated number in correlation to humiliation. Some games require skill to time attack patterns and platform positions, while other just throw cheap gimmicks into the mix such as laughter, provoking dialog or taunting gestures. It is mostly with the tolerance level of the player. Does Uncraft World manage to provoke the player with timed puzzles or chastise the player with cheap trap placement?\n\nThe primary objective of the game is to rescue lovely ladies by maneuvering through obstacle courses to blast apart the glass blocking them from freedom. Along the way, you will need to look for chests filled with money (in the care of a bikini clad lady) to unlock additional levels that reward character skins and additional paths on the world map. The world map stretches outward from the center and each map increases in difficulty the further out you go. There are roughly 50 maps available with a level editor you can use to make additional maps. You can also change the background images of the maps (the ladies you are trying to rescue) with your own images, but the courses always stay the same.\n\nThe blocky appearance of the environment does the job it needs to do. The character can change skins once unlocked and each one still appears blocky, but with enough color and detail changes to stand out. Environments are varied enough, ranging from demonic plains, feudal castles and mountains. It is all very low grade, but it helps outline the levels. The main focus of the game is the obstacles and each map does its best to stay unique. The starting maps are embarrassingly easy, but by the half way point the challenge ramps up enough to keep things interesting. Chests are stored behind some crazy traps and getting in and out without dying can be tricky sometimes. Checkpoints are stationed relatively close to each other and the maps are rather short, so the overall rage inducing never hit me. It felt doable even on the last few maps and never felt cheap. There is also a co-op function where you can enjoy the madness with other people, but it was a cluster bomb visually so I stuck to single player to finish the game.\n\nThis game has its' fair share of problems too, mostly revolving around the fact you need Windows Media Player installed to play the game. Black screens, start-up issues and loading screen freezes are just a couple of problems derived from this. Reinstalling the service can fix a majority of issues, but some are known to persist. One such issue can fill the monitor dimension with a white screen, preventing access to Task manager and requiring a forced shutdown. Some  images also loaded in as a blue background, but this only happened twice. Collision detection and jump feedback can be a bit finicky at crucial points, especially when it is required to make mid air jumps to grab chests. Whether by design or not, it can be a nuisance.\n\nWhile I have never been a platform enthusiast, I can see someone enjoying this game. Whether it is for the artwork used as a minor encouragement to complete the levels or those looking for a medium challenge to fill an afternoon, there is some meat to the bones depending on the skill level. I managed to complete it all in three hours with some ease after I turned off the aggravation setting in the audio menu (a guy will spout WTF type lines whenever you mess up). I will be back to see how the game progresses in the future, but for the time being I can say it served its' purpose.\n\nPros\n\n- Mildly challenging platformer with level editor\n- Nice artwork that can be substituted with own\n- Music is decent\n\nCons\n\n- Windows Media Player related issues\n- Collision detection can be an issue\n","May 4","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has some odd issues where you'll hit part of a block and you may get shoved into your death, which may be aggravating when you're stuck in a certain part of a level. Other than that, it's a pretty good game with a fun and challenging mechanic. It may feel a bit clunky to start, but eventually you'll get a feel for it.\n\nThey do have a lack of a self destruct button or a closed map as there are certain maps where you can get stuck in a certain part of the map and you'll have to restart the whole level. The game does very well in making a difficult platformer and the use of the jetpack makes the game all the more challenging.","January 8","true","16.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As soon as it gets really hard some problems begin to shine through you didn't see on the lower difficulty:\n\n1. At first the checkpoints seem reasonably set, but as harder the level get the longer they get, but they don't get more checkpoints. So as the courses get harder you have to play ever growing bits again and again.\n\n2. The game lets you geuss where you have to go. The only clues you get are some arrows pointing in a direction at the checkpoints, but because the course goes up and down, left and right it doesn't help you much as soon as the levels get a bit more complicated. Sometimes even in the easy levels you can't tell what's in the foreground and what's in the background and as soon as the levels get more complicated it's nearly impossible to tell. These two things then change the game from a funny little platformer to a trial and error mess, where you guess the right way and die a million times until you find the right way.\n\n3. The character slides a little when he lands. This will kill you many times when you have to land on a surface that's even smaller than you, because even if you hit the surface you will still slide off and die.\n\n4. I had the problem that for some reason the game didn't fit in my computer screen, so the edge was cut off, but I couldn't find any ingame options menu to change something at the graphic settings.\n\n\nThese are the things that in my opinion destroy the game. There are a few other things like the music that is good at the beginning, but as soon as the levels get harder and longer it gets really nerve-wracking because it loops the hole time. And the cursing of the character when he dies is also pretty annoying, but you can turn it off, so no damage there as soon as you realise it.\nSo yea, in my opinion it's pretty much youtube gold and probably some hardcore platformer will enjoy the game for more than 2 hours, but I can not recommend it.","September 29, 2015","false","1.6"," 35 of 76 people (46%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","46","35","76","4","0"

Plenty of challenge and the difficulty increases incrementally in a good way. Controls are tight, gameplay is smooth. Some of the level designs are sneaky and mean, but not impossible, so it's ok. When you die, you restart instantly, so there are no load times. That's perfect for a game like this where you WILL die a lot.  Has a few bugs, sometimes levels won't load. Overall, definitely worth the money. The pictures are just a bonus to the gameplay.\n\nDoes not have a gallery feature to view artwork, but you can go into the game files yourself for that.","February 29","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
