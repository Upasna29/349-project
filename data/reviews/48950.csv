"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frondescence/recommended/48950/","frondescence","Frondescence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frondescence/","137 products in account","Greed Corp is a turn-based strategy game that you can play either singleplayer, vs up to three pcs, or multiplayer.  The story is a basic one for each of the four playable groups; however, their differences in-game are graphical only.  The full story took me around twelve or so hours to complete.\n\nGreed Corp uses a hexagon-tile battlefield in which you can use the land in order to gain more money to buy units and buildings.  However, the more you use the land to gain money, the more it deteriorates and disappears completely.  It is a delicate balance between building units to conquer land and kill enemy units, using the land for money before your opponents do, and conserving the strength and number of tiles in your control.  The win condition is to be the last player left standing.\n\nI greatly enjoyed this game and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a turn-based strategy game.  Learning how to play the game is fairly easy, but there is definitely strategy to be had in this game.","December 5, 2013","true","11.3"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

The game is focused around a world made up of tall hexagon-shaped pillars which stand in the middle of a massive ocean. The various factions which occupy the world have finally begun to reach the bottom of the seemingly endless supply of resources in the ground and their constant drilling and mining has caused large portions of the world to simply collapse into the ocean. The turn-based mechanics are easy to grasp and are complex enough to let even veterans of such games enjoy the fun. The graphics quality is fantastic with a low setting capable of running on very low end machines. The game does possess a significant amount of replayability thanks to the multiplayer mode although the single player campaign is reasonably fun the second time around.","November 25, 2013","true","31.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Territory only lasts for so long, since you harvest money from the land, and that land is slowly destroyed because of it. The war can only go for so long before somebody's section crumbles and falls down into the endless abyss of clouds.","May 18, 2015","true","13.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

While there are 4 different factions in the game, they share the same 4 units.  The single player campaign quickly becomes tedious when all battles consist of the same exact strategy,  I can imagine this game might be more enjoyable multiplayer, but that aspect is pretty dead.","January 14, 2014","false","6.8"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","24","36","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alevice/recommended/48950/","alevice","Alevice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alevice/","1117 products in account","This a small TBS worth due to it's simplicity and effectiveness in its mechanics. It is a Risk styled game, where you control a faction that must destrtoy all enemy factions in a hexagonal tile base map. In order to do thta, players must generate income, done so by placing Harvesters accross the field; the important bit here is that harvesters generate income by smashing the tile where it was placed, in addition to all adjacent tiles; every time a tile is smashed, it lowers it's height, reaching a point where the tile fractures and subsequently collapses - what this means is that, as income is generated, the battlefield gets eventually destroyed, and by the end game, its rather common that only a couple of tiles remain in the whole battlefield.\n\nThe game is entirely deterministic - no dice is rolled at all. A duel is resoleved by the size of the attacking force, with the casualties determined by simple substraction (invading force unit count - defending force unit count). Addionally, all maps are perfectly symmetrical. This leaves the game's conflict to be entirely resolved by player's strategy and nothing else. This is easier said than done, however, as the tile destruction inflicted by harvesters (and player-deployed artillery) constantly change the battlefield, your strategy is in an ever constant need for change.\n\nThe game lacks a bit of variety, so it can easily become a little repetitive - this is not Chess nor Go in regards to depth. An expande sequel would have been indeed welcome, but this never came to pass. I still recommend it heartily if you are a fan of TBS.","November 26, 2013","true","7.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

I am very glad I got it now, as opposed to the other prospects I had lined up.\n\nThis game plays like Risk, but has some really awesome new mechanics that make the game worth getting. The biggest mechanic is the game's titular use of greed to change the landscape: you can use harvesters to work the land and get money, but ever time you do, the land they stand on is slowly lowered until it collapses. This introduces some seriously awesome strategies in the game; one time I planted a harvester in the middle of an enemy island in order to collapse it and take out everyone on the island. I didn't have to use any of my troops or engage in a time-consuming siege- all I had to do was attack an unprotected square my opponent had left neglected, plant a harvester there, and laugh as the ground literally crumbled under their troops.\n\nThis review is getting really long, but let me just tell you this before I finish: GET THIS GAME. It's definitely worth it, and the only things wrong with it aren't even part of the game itself, they're problems with the developer, whom has discontinued supporting the game and thusly Greed Corp's servers are dead.\n\nThe campaign is about 10 hours of gameplay, and it's pretty nice. However, the true worth of this game comes from the multiplayer, which can still happen... we always find a way. My only regrets is that this game doesn't have any steam workshop support, and that the developer seems to have done a disappearing act.","April 12, 2015","true","18.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kysimir/recommended/48950/","Kysimir","Shortlived","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kysimir/","202 products in account","This game is challenging.  As many other reviewers have noted, there isn't much in the way of multiplayer gameplay, which leaves the majority of the game to be played as Single Player.  The problem with single player strategy games is it can be difficult to determine what your opponent is going to do.  Sometimes your "Skilled" or "Expert" opponent is an imbecile, and other times they are Alexander the Great.\n\nThe game is frustratingly difficult.  Part of that is in no small part because it revolves around four units, physics, and board game mechanics.  If this were a more popular game, or at least had steam integration so I could invite friends to play it, this would be a great time waster with friends.  However, as it stands, its an ultimately just a test of patience.","January 18, 2014","false","4.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It's RISK gets greedy in this turn-based strategy game. The dice roll mechanics are simplified to a straight "walker vs walker" (the only unit) numbers game with the edge going to the attacker. But then add in buildings, the most iconic of which is the harvester. It adds resources each turn that you can use to build more buildings and walkers, but it also lowers the tile it's on -- until it crumbles and "falls off" the map, taking any of your units and buildings (or the enemy's) on that tile with it. Now start considering those as offensive weapons and the game just got way more interesting.","December 20, 2013","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I must admit I very much doubted that it'd scale well to PC, after all there are so many games that just don't scale to a PC well. Greed Corp isn't an exception to this. It's begging for a windowed mode. Let me explain.\n\nThe strategy and gameplay is still pretty good it's a nice game to just sit and play. It's very area or control based, but doesn't tax your concentration too much. You could easily be playing this whilst watching something else on your computer. If you could window the game it'd be great to multi-task on the computer with. Sadly, I don't seem to be able to do that here.\n\nPersonally, I'd recommend putting the game on your phone or tablet rather than PC. It's a decent little game and has a fair play time (at least two hours to complete the campaign), but isn't really a fully fledged PC game.","October 13, 2014","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

All four sides are functionally the same, but with differing aesthetics. Balance is vital, however, as the money-making harvesters you build will eventually destroy the hexagons around them. As such, the need for money creates a conflict with the need to have an actual battlefield to war upon. This need for balance produces a very unique array of strategies to employ. The music and night-time ambience really adds to the feel of the game, as do the army designs.

The rules of the game are pretty simple, but the strategy remains deep. That alone makes this game worth considering for strategy fans. I really have no issues with how the game works mechanically. The story's uninteresting and unimportant. I usually ended up turning the music and sound off; they don't add much. The graphics look pretty good, with one complaint: it's very hard to tell which building does what from appearance alone, which is sometimes problematic.\n\nFans of slower strategy games should look at picking this one up.

The rules of the game are pretty simple, but the strategy remains deep. That alone makes this game worth considering for strategy fans. I really have no issues with how the game works mechanically. The story's uninteresting and unimportant. I usually ended up turning the music and sound off; they don't add much. The graphics look pretty good, with one complaint: it's very hard to tell which building does what from appearance alone, which is sometimes problematic.\n\nFans of slower strategy games should look at picking this one up.

However, the jazzy big band music adds a really nice 'booming 20s' feel to the industrialized madness!\n\nAs mentioned in several other reviews on this game, there are times when the slightly unforgiving gameplay mechanics create a stalemate; where the first person to move will ultimately lose the match.

The rules of the game are pretty simple, but the strategy remains deep. That alone makes this game worth considering for strategy fans. I really have no issues with how the game works mechanically. The story's uninteresting and unimportant. I usually ended up turning the music and sound off; they don't add much. The graphics look pretty good, with one complaint: it's very hard to tell which building does what from appearance alone, which is sometimes problematic.\n\nFans of slower strategy games should look at picking this one up. There seems to be lots of support for online play, if you're in to that. The biggest issue I would worry about is that there aren't any extra play modes, and there's no difference in the factions, so you may not get much milage out of the game if you find the battles boring. $10 may be a little much, but it's worth getting if you find it cheap.","February 13, 2012","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For as nice the game looks, however, there isn't much to it once you've scratched the surface. In essence, Greed Corp is a poor man's Risk, providing a painfully simple and straightforward unit creation and combat system with predictable AI, so each battle pretty much plays itself once you know what to do to counter the enemy's moves.

Egy rossz döntés és törheti az ember a fejét, hogyan vergődik ki a csávából. Elgondolkodtató a játék viszont a zenei aláfestés feloldja ezt egy kicsit.
