I wasn't expecting this much fun from a game that costs $2.99 (not including the discount!) It's scaled very well, and despite being a multiplatform release, looks pretty good on pc and does give you the choice of using a keyboard, a mouse, or a combination of the two. The enemies aren't stupid and winning on normal can often be a challenge depending on what faction you are versing, and hard is actually pretty challenging. Also, the research and upgrading tab means you can actually use different strategies and it isn't just the same game over and over. And finally, the idea for a "Scrambled" faction is brilliant!\n\nIf you are looking for a short video to show you what the game is, here's a link to a 2 minute one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jUFD9CUA_Q\n\nAnd if you're looking for a more indepth look at the game, here's a link to an approximately 20 minute video that looks at multiple modes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ83YypDxdM&feature=youtu.be","July 3, 2014","true","5.4"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","54","58","0","0"

So I went into it not much expecting, but I am getting some pleasant surprises. Don't expect anything fancy from graphics or sound - they do the job, but that's it. As for so many Indie games, this one is all about the gameplay.\nBasically, this is a tower defense game: you have to gather resources (happens automatically), build ever more powerful units, and research upgrades for them. With these spaceships, the goal is to reach the mothership of your opponent, at the other side of the playfield, while at the same time defending your own mothership against incoming attacks.\nSince there is only one path between the two bases, most of the time the two opposing fleets meet somewhere in between, slowly (or faster if you're good) progressing towards the enemy's side. There is not much more to it: the core gameplay is dead simple, but it has something about it that keeps the attention going. One does have to make important and micro-strategic decisions: does one invest the resources gathered into new ships, or rather into upgrades? And there is a neat supra research-tree, which allows you to spend resource points that affects all or any of the three factions in the game.\n\nPart of the attraction of the game surely lies in the excellent way it is embedded in the Steam cloud, with achievements, trading cards, multiplayer options, rankings, etc. Name it, and this game has it. So for the moment I want to try going up on the ladder, or win my first multiplayer. It's a simple game, but it does what it wants to do pretty good.\n\nGameplay: 21/30\nGraphics: 10/20\nSound: 5/10\nLongelivety: 14/20 (MP looks promising)\nTechnical: 6/10 (I had one very bad crash after exiting)\nPersonal rating: 6/10\n\nOverall socre: 62/100\n\n60-70/100: a good game, worth purchasing if in discount or if you like the genre","July 26, 2014","true","6.2"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","24","28","0","2"

You don't directly control your units but you have abilities and controls the unit buil flow. There is no base building either but a research tree for upgrades and unlocking ships, plus an extensive upgrade shop to improve the armies. Kind of like a tower defense, minus the towers so it's more like fleet attack+mothership defense. All in all, I was missing PC strategy games so variants in the genre are always welcomed.\n\nSome of the battles feel like massive wars of attrition where you desperately upgrade and send ships non stop at lightning speed clicks. Stuff can get fairly intense as you realise the enemy is pushing to your side and fending off your fleet.\n\nMaybe it lacks the depth of other strategy titles but for the asking price it's hard to say no.","July 6, 2014","true","12.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/preludebot/recommended/304670/","preludebot","PreludeBot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/preludebot/","197 products in account","Aeon Command is a deceivingly challenging tug-of-war game with strategy elements that almost reminds me of an RTS. You don't have to command units, they automatically attack the enemy. The only thing the player does is manage resources, applies powerups (buffs, debuffs), deploys weapons (nukes, emps), and purchases upgrades for units. The more obvious thing players must do is build units. I found it relaxing, rewarding, and late games were challenging and exhilarating.\n\nThere's 3 factions to choose from and they all have their own unique appearance and they all have their own weapons. However, they have similar basic unit types which keeps it fairly well balanced. I say fairly because there are some different support units for each faction. The similarities will be noticeable in attack units. I had little trouble identifying an enemy ship and launching the appropriate counter. Watching the space battles unfold is quite interesting, it reminded me of Battlestar Galactica for some reason. A word of warning, this game starts off unforgivingly and you may lose many of your first matches. Does it get better? Yes it does, because of two types of upgrades. There are game-wide upgrades that you can upgrade from the main menu and these are purchased using "gear parts" you acquire from destroyed enemies. These upgrades are applied to every game thereafter. The second type of upgrade is the in-game upgrades which must be purchased with scrap and these only apply for the duration of that match. Generally, upgrades modify weapons and armour but there are also resource collection upgrades which I researched first because the best economy almost always wins.\n\nThe campaigns are short and aren't full of narrative. If you want a deep story, you won't find it in this game. HOWEVER, I recommend this game because of high replay value and the gameplay is well polished.\n\nThe soundtrack is more like ambience and I found it added to the atmosphere. Sound effects from weapons to explosions are also well done. The only sound effect that drove me nuts was the spacial anomaly sound effect which you'll only hear in 1 or 2 campaign missions anyway.\n\nPros:    RTS elements that still keeps you involved in the battle.\nWell balanced units that still stand apart and look interesting.\nNice sound effects and music.\nUPGRADES HERE, UPGRADES THERE, UPGRADES EVERYWHERE! \o/\nStraight forward tutorial.\nUnit and upgrade prices are reasonable.\nCons:    Short campaigns with little narrative.\nNo unit descriptions except one-time descriptions in the campaign.\nThe enemy will sometimes spam tugs which will tow your entire fleet to their dooms.\nNeutral:    Unforgiving for new players.\n\nI had a lot of fun with this game and I am absolutely astonished that (as of purchasing this game) no one in my friends list has this on their wishlist or owns it. So if you're reading this, I highly recommend it for it's replay value and the great gameplay. 8/10","November 2, 2015","true","2.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","11","11","2","0"

I enjoyed my time playing it, but after beating the main campaign and playing a few skirmishes, it leaves me with a thought in my mind that says, now what?\n\nObviously, multiplayer would be a grand option...but no one is active in the multiplayer, so unless you have friends who play this, it is unlikely you will ever find a real human to play against.\n\nReplaying the campaign doesn't change anything either besides getting a better high score. Sigh...\n\nSo after 3.5 hours, it appears I have maxed out my time with Aeon Command. A game I thoroughly enjoyed playing but ended up short with little replayability.\n\nEven after all that, the game is priced fairly and is something I can see improving if the Dev ever decides to revisit this game. I did enjoy my time with this game. I did like this game. But, there isn't much to do after beating the 2 hour long campaign.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinhunt3r/recommended/304670/","sinhunt3r","SinHunt3r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinhunt3r/","222 products in account","Aeon Command is a streamlined space RTS.  You start with a mothership and are tasked with collecting resources to build space craft to take on the opposing mothership.  You really just have one collectable resource which is metal.  You also have eneregy to use abilities but that is automatically generated over time or collected as power-ups from the wreckage of defeated enemy ships.  Once you get some resources flowing you can start to build ships to assail your enemy.  Once built your ships will automatically seek out and attack the enemy.  You can't directly control combat but you can influence the battles using special abilities to buff your troops or debuff and even damage the enemy fleet.  The trick comes down to what ships to produce when and what improvements to research.  You can research better ships and improve your ships armor and weapons during play.  You can also permanently augment the ships and abilities of the three different playable factions by spending upgrades collected in the campaign and skirmishes.\nAeon Command contains a single player camaign and a skirmish mode.  The campaign is a tutorial and campaign in one.  The campaign is pretty easy with a difficulty spike at the end.  Once you start to really understand resource management and research you'll dominate the campaign in no time.  I have not tried the multiplayer but I imagine it would be pretty fun to battle it out with a friend.\nOverall a fun game.  It probably won't occupy you for too long (the campaign can be beaten in a couple hours) but for a few bucks it's a pretty fun space game.","October 30, 2014","true","9.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

If you don't know what a tug of war game is, let me explain: A tug a war game is where you typically have 2 teams. Both teams have to build a structure which represents a unit which will continually spawn after set times in waves, those units will (usually) all spawn at the same time and without any control from the player, will run towards the enemy base, attacking your enemy's army as it encounters them. As time progresses and you farm more and more resources, your army gets bigger and so does your enemy's. Certain units counter certain other units so it's really up to the teams to figure out how to counter their enemy and destroy their base first. It's a huge amount of fun and very addictive.\n\nUnfortunately, this game just has no heart at all. It's a 1v1 tug of war which will basically wear out your left mouse button as all you do is click repeatedly to create a unit. It's created instantly and there are no waves. There is, however, a spawn cooldown. It's short but it's there, which means rather than armies pushing each other in waves, you get long strings of individual ships which may or may not gather up if they stop to fight. Ships will not automatically spawn either; you click on their build icon and they spawn there once and that's it.\n\nIncredibly boring and nothing compared to the custom mods you get in those games. I would say that if you have never played a game like this before, this might be a nice cheap (if you get it on sale) place to start. If you have Warcraft/Starcraft and want something similar to Desert Strike or Black and white, don't bother; this can't compare.","May 15, 2015","false","0.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Like it says in the description this is a 'tug of war' style game where you gather resources and produce units to proceed towards the enemy mothership (base) and destroy it, engaging any enemy fighters along the way. You do not have direct control over your units, however you can turn the tide of battle with abilities which cost energy points to use that slowly regenerate automatically. These include abilities that can heal your ships, stun enemy ships, or nuke a small area. Graphics are pretty unsurprising given the budget and it looks like a glorified flash game, however thankfully for a strategy game graphics are easily forgiven, not to mention expectations are low at this price point. Games are short (~5-10min) making it the perfect bite-size RTS, you will not find a huge amount of depth here and some strategies can be exploited to easily win matches against AI but it even includes a multiplayer mode to play against your friends!

The graphics are certainly more than adequate to do the job, and the audio fits the art style and theme of gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay, however, won't win any awards for depth or breadth.  You spam numbers/clicks to build ships, use different keys/clicks to use special abilities, determine which ships to unlock and/or upgrade, and click on icons in the combat window to get resource, upgrade, or energy bonuses.\n\nLikewise the campaign is nothing to write home about.  You get a set number of missions which each introduce a new ship or skill, do the same number of missions for each race, or game mode, and that's it.  The campaign is little more than a tutorial for skirmish games.\n\nSkirmish, on the other hand, is where the game both shines and shows its worst flaw.  You get to play with all the races, all the game modes, all the range options, and even mix things up so that you and/or your enemy get a random assortment of ships and special abilities.  You could, for example, get the mining craft from race A which costs 8 resources to build (the others cost 10), a healer ship, a chain lightning ship, a railgun ship, and so on.  It will never randomly assign ships outside of their assigned slot so that you'll never get 2 or 3 ships normally in slot six, but it suffices to provide some variety in gameplay.  The game also provides three "difficulty" modes, and that is where the game's biggest flaw comes into play.\n\nThe AI cheats, at least on Hard difficulty.  It doesn't cheat by being "smarter" or by reacting faster to changes than a human can, nor do AI-controlled ships do any better when run by an AI player than a human.  Instead the developers opted to give the AI bonuses to resource acquisition.  Either it gets a steady stream of the crystals and energy or it gets a significant boost to how much it gets when it gets it.\n\nThis isn't a case of me being a bad player and blaming it on the game, nor is it a case of not understanding how the game works.  It's simply a matter of observing the facts.  When the AI is producing more ships than I can despite having the same number of collection ships out, and when the AI can use 55 energy skills/powers before I even have 1 energy, the AI is, in fact, cheating.  Edit:  I found a perfect example of the sort of benefits the AI gets over players.  As a player, I only get energy from killing enemy ships, but despite the AI having destroyed none of my ships it was able to pop off two EMPs and a Repair, total cost around 100 energy, at a time when I had only 17 energy, and this was less than four minutes into the game.\n\nOver the course of half a dozen games against a Hard AI using the Cyborg race I had one of my first three combat ships mind controlled when I had 0 energy, the ship had just been produced, and while it was in range of my base ship and thus nowhere near enemy lines.  Furthermore, during my last play session I used Cheat Engine four times to bump my credits up by 1k, 1.5k, 2k, and 2.5k, and the first three were not enough to build and upgrade enough ships to give me a fighting chance.  It wasn't until I did the 2.5k bump that I had enough, and enough upgrades, to fight the AI with some degree of parity.  Eventually I won by spamming the slot 6 ship which, more often than not, can be an "I win" button for each race if you get a large enough swarm of them going.\n\nThis sort of cheating doesn't completely ruin gameplay, but it does make me want to avoid playing against Cyborgs or playing as Cyborgs on Hard.  Still, at $2.99 I'm more than willing to cut the developers some slack on shipping the game with a "difficulty" option that, at least for me, makes certain race/gameplay/side combinations absolute no-nos.  It's still something that should be considered if that sort of thing really irritates you.  The game is still quite fun up until Hard, and even on Hard as long as I play Human or Exile it's still quite enjoyable and winnable.","April 17, 2015","true","26.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

As a result, the commands are vastly simplified, and combat is fast. The problem is the AI relies on timing. If you build your ships in the wrong order, you're likely to lose and have no way to recover other than to die and start over, at least against AI. On the other hand, the multiplayer capability makes games a bit more unpredictable. All in all, you should at least give this game a try.\n\nThe combat in Aeon Command is simple: you do NOT give orders to your ships. They know to engage the enemy. Instead, your job as commander is the build the units and/or deploy special abilities such as EMP, repair, and so on. There are variety of units, from simple fighters to long-range bombers to shield-bearers, and a few other units.\n\nYou don't group ships yourself. Instead, by building them together (close in time) they will congregate and fight as a group themselves. However, this means you have to let resources accumulate to the level when you can build them in quick succession rather than building them one at a time but somehow hold them back until your signal.\n\nYou do need to gather some resources, which are some asteroids near your mothership. You simply build a few miners (usually, one per asteroid, with one or two spares to account for travel time) and they'll do their jobs. The problem is, when enemies get too close, they will shoot at your mothership and the miners, and if you lose the mothership it's game over. And there's no way to repair the mothership should it suffer damage (but repair works on the small crafts).\n\nThe overall objective is to conquer the map by destroying the other side's mothership, of course.\n\nThe main problem with this game is while it plays fast, after a certain point the game's already won or lost, and there's little point to force it to continue. In other words, if you already look like you're losing, then you indeed are and there's no way you can "dig" yourself out of a huge hole.\n\nWith multiple factions (each with some unique abilities), dozens of battle scenarios, multiplayer, Aeon Command is an interesting take on the space strategy genre with inspiration from old classic. If you value a simple and fast tactical strategy combat game, Aeon Command may scratch that itch. it's not complex, nor does it pretend to be.\n","May 14, 2015","true","5.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Most choices are obvious.\nFor example at the start of 95% of the battles you should start by building as many miners as possible, why not start with this allready built and start with more interesting decisions.\n\nThen battles "strategy" is often upgrade one of your units to max tech, then built as many of this type (plus a few of the other types as support).\nThere are 3 factions, with differents units and perks. But again this has little impact on strategy, and play the same.\nEach faction as only 6 ships and 3 special power.\nIt tooks me 4 hours to complete the campaign, only one of the scenario was really challening and required a careful strategy , then 1 hour to try the various skirmish modes.\nAnd now there are little replay value.\n\nProduction is fine and the game run smoothly, but for content wise this feels like a draft (even for a casual game).

You build units who you do not directly control, but who automatically fly to the other end of the map and fight each other. The objective is to destroy your opponent's mothership. Often, it's a war of attrition - you just try to outbuild your opponent, trying to balance that with buying research to improve your ships in the long term. However, there's a decent variety of units and special powers (all unique to each faction), so there's plenty of room for strategising and countering your opponent.\n\nOutside each battle you can spend upgrade points, to do things like improve specific ships, or increase the rate at which you gain resources.\n\nOnce you've finished with the campaign, there's a skirmish mode, or multiplayer.

This strategy game relies on your knowledge of the opposing team's ships, and your own upgrades and ships in order to win. Once the campaign is complete however, the game can become extremely repetative, especially when you work out the strengths and weakness's of each team. The harder difficulty can become very easy to beat, and to complete the acheivements I found myself grinding against the hardest opponents, and beating them in 5 or so minutes. For those people who collect Perfect games (100% complete), this game can be completed around 6-7 hours. The most humerous part of this game is the fact that I was defeated on the tutorial (my only defeat), as I was reading the text on screen not realising that the opposing team was building up and preparing to attack (a very steap learning curve there :3). The gameplay itself is a tug-of-war style, and once you figure out the basic game mechanics somewhat less a tug-of-war as a slaughter-your-opponent.

It's much like the Starcraft custom maps I used to play back in the day.  Ripping through fleets of ships is very satisfying, and the game appears to be very well balanced.  However, it isn't perfect, and the low price point is very justified.\n\nThe campaign is pretty short and mostly easy, with very difficult final missions thrown in at the end which accounts for most of the game's length.  While that sounds like a damnning critique, I still very much enjoyed the time I spent with this game, and I would love to revisit this game again if the devs decide to add some more missions.\n\nThe interface has some pretty major problems, which I'll list:\n\n- There's no reason for the Research panel to be a huge popup window in the center of the screen, which prohibits you from picking up powerups while it's active.  The research panel should be a compact sidebar that gives you easy access to your upgrades at all times, and allows you to monitor them continuously.\n\n- There's no way to queue up units, so this game is a bit of a keyboard masher.  This isn't horrible, but definitely inferior to  an actual unit queueing system.\n\n- Map scrolling halts when your cursor hits the edge of the screen, causing you to "drag" the map over and over to navigate.  The map scrolling function should be free while the mouse button is held down.\n\n- I personally do not like clickable powerups in strategy games like this (a trend that I believe gathered a lot of momentum from Plants vs. Zombies, which constantly has you clicking coins and resources until you want to shoot yourself).  I think this game can keep the powerup system, but just make them pick up when I mouse over.  It's just annoying to me, and takes away from the strategy aspect of the game, which is the game I actually want to play.\n\nI think the resource gathering aspect of this game could use a bit more depth.  As it stands now, your miners are just something you max out early on and replace if they get destroyed, and they allow the enemy to snowball you if they get the upper hand (which is fine, a match has to end somehow).  You also can't mine into your enemy's territory, once you hit the end of your half of the map, you can't mine anymore.  Because of this, the game misses out on fun possibilities of map control.\n\nDespite all my complaints, I like this game, and I recommend it based on the low price point.  It's a fun way to spend an afternoon on the weekend.","July 5, 2014","true","12.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I'll be coming back to this game periodcally for quite a while.\n\nShort learning curve, lots of tactical variety, perfect lunch break game.\n\nA no-brainer on sale. No regrets at full price.

Art style, soothing music and design were all mentioned. Some mentioned tidbits about rewarding gameplay, from my experience this is completly wrong.\n\nOnce again I was to say that maybe it's not the game I was looking for.\n\nCons\n-------------------------------\nThis is a space stragegy game about 3 races or factions that fight against each other. When you open up the game for the first time though, 2 of the races are locked. It seems that you have to finish each campaign before the next is unlocked. While this is all fine and dandy, it's not something I like becaise I can't just go in and play as well as something later.\n\nThe tutorial is dreadful. The game has a skirmish mode and a tutorial mode. Why do I bring up both? Because they are the same thing apart from that the tutotorial has white text overlaying the screen. The tutorial isn't a smaller easier bite-sized part of the game. It's just throwing you in and then giving you commands that come to late for you to comprehend before the AI kills you in its standard skirmish mode. There are comments where people have only beaten the tutorial after ~30 hours. While this may be hypebole, I find this to be horrible. A tutorial should teach you how to play, not be a standard difficulty challenge with overlay.\n\nCampaign\n_________________\nI was never able to beat the second level of the first campaign. The reason being that no matter how fast or slow I macro, by the time a single one of my ships reaches their mothership a group of 5 ships magically appear from the enemy. Now this wouldn't be to bad as a swarming enemy is quite normal. What is horrible is that in combat a single enemy basic fighter can easily take down two of mine. It's not even a fair fight from the power standpoint let alone that they have 3 fighters and 2 bombers.\n\nGame Design)\n_________________\nNothing about this game apart from having 3 campaigns tells me this is more than a simple flash game. Its a simple click to create units and earn money game. Simple create more units and send them along a path. If I could micro the units then it would make more sense, but you don't. They ride on rails and follow and AI.\n\n\n\nNOT WORTH TIME OR MONEY.","June 21, 2015","false","0.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

It's not a particularly complex, or in-depth strategy game, but to those who enjoyed the flash game Age of War, it will be entertaining.  The interface allows keyboard commands, which increases playability significantly.  There are campaigns to go through, but my favorite part is playing scramble in scenario mode, where each unit is randomly selected front one of the playable races.  It's generally a resource management game, where you try to mine as much as possible and upgrade your units as fast as possible while keeping the enemy at bay so you can eventually overwhelm them.  It is surprisingly replayable, because there are times that I have had matches lasting 3 minutes, and sometimes they last 10.  I would recommend this game as an intermitten time waster, because if you sit down and drill through, you will beat this game very quickly.","January 9","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And for that, it does it well.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Campaign that walks you through all the mechanics of the game in an easy to understand way\n-Nice and simple art that gets the job done.\n-Performance is good. Runs smoothly on my 2012 laptop.\n-Has three different modes and three different factions. Also gives you the option of scrambling all the units and factions together in skirmish mode (1 on 1 against the AI)\n-Steam achievements that force you to play in a few ways you would not normally do.\n\n\nCONS:\n-Lacks variety of gameplay. The three types of skirmish modes are not that different from each other\n-Inability to control ships. You are mainly making strategic decisions on what and when to build. You also have some tactical decisions to make when using small perks/abilities like healing, nuking, etc.\n-Limited tactical/strategic depth. The most you'll get out of this is scrambling your units in skirmish mode and figuring out the best strategy to use the mix of units\n-Less tug of war and more "quick momentum"  type game. You can rarely recover from a bad decision and once the AI takes advantage it's basically over.\n-Multiplayer is nonexistent\n\n\nOverall it's a good casual time waster. It looks nice and I like to play it for 15 minutes or so when I'm listening to podcasts or music. Judging from a casual game perspective it's a good buy.

The game is interesting and engaging, but once you've completed the campaign there's really not much of anything to do.  Getting to 100% is a mind-numbing grind and replayability just isn't that fun.\n\nPros:\n- Campaign is fun\n- Each faction is unique and fun to play\n\nCons:\n- There's a huge bug where your upgrades like auto-mining and auto-energy generation don't work at all.  I'm not sure, but this could also mean that all other Gear-related upgrades don't work either - the mining and energy related ones are the only ones that give a visual indicator of whether they're working or not.\n- Due to the above, your only chance of beating the "Hard" AI in skirmish mode is to rush them.  Then one of two things happens: You win(yay!), or more likely the enemy starts spamming energy skills which makes it impossible to beat them.  "Hard" AI seems to have an unlimited amount of energy or generates energy extremely quickly - you cannot compete if it starts using energy skills.\n- You need 360 Gears to max out all upgrades.  You can earn maybe 4-7 in a "Medium" AI skirmish, and 5-7.  So you're looking at probably 70-90 rounds.  After doing the campaign and some skirmishes, I'm sitting at 34 wins, 0 losses, and nowhere close to finishing all the upgrades.\n- Replayability just isn't fun.  You spam the same build orders, upgrade chain, etc.  Once you find a good starting order of things, it's just the same thing over and over and over and over and over.  With the goal of 360 gears in mind....it's just too much.\n","June 20, 2015","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So, I didn't really need much to make up for my money and this game did deliver. It's probably worth five times that! ($5).\n\nThis game is sort of a mix between tower defense/ chess and tug of war. You have one base ship which can't move and basically serves as a factory. It then pops out baby ships which run towards the enemy and fight the enemy baby ships. You can research different kinds of ships and upgrade them and based on the power or combination of the ships you have you will win the tug of war and hopefully push to the enemy mothership and destroy it and win and that's it. Game over.\n\nThere's a campaign but it's not very different from skirmish. So I mean, I usually play it while I'm watching a movie or listening to music.

I'd not call it 'bare bones' so much as admit it's a very simple game that focuses more on the planning and gameplay than anything else; that's not to say that they ignored everything else, but you can easily see what their best aspect is.\n\nDifficulty-wise, I'd say it's too easy. I like a challenge now and again, and the thing here is that with a simple game comes a simple A.I. - one that needs a bit of a boost (resource-wise) to keep up with an actual planning player (and will nearly always still fall short to one who's actually on their feet and assiging commands properly). That's not to say the game's not fun - there's still a simple satisfaction in playing it and seeing your amassed army do the dirty work for you.\n\nAchievements-wise, this game will take you a while. It's rather easy to hit 100% since the story mode is a glorified tutorial and introduction (with smatterings of plot, I guess) and the career achievements are really ones that would take you a fair bit of time. It wont even take you that long to come up with a winning build that could consistently win you games at 4-5minutes each and it's just a matter, then, of putting in the hours.\n\nOverall, I would recommend it. It's simple but good, and the for the price, matches expectations.","December 15, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Scrambled sends you out with a fleet comprised of vessels from all three of the races, so you never know what you will have for your battle fleet.\n\nMy games last from about 4 minutes...  to the longest game ran 21 minutes for me.

It made me laugh pretty hard!  lol That alone was worth the .74 cents I bought this game for! lol\n\nAnyway, during the tutorial a real game is running in the background.  You read some text and then try some things in the real game.  You do this for a bit.  Problem is, the enemy is building up forces while you're reading and learning!  The enemy killed me way before the tutorial was over, so I couldn't do anything but quit! The text I was reading and the game over screen were mixed together making it unreadable!  LMAO!!!  Great tutorial dev's! lol\n\nI played a skirmish after the good laugh that I had, but it was a constant tug-of-war game.  I had to quit the skirmish too as either side was not going to win and it got really boring and repetitive.  I did not play the campaign yet.\n\nThere really isn't much to do other than click on buttons to build ships, upgrade your ships and mine for resources to build more ships, which is also automatic.  Your ships move towards the enemy mothership and try to destroy it automatically and the enemy is doing the same.  That is where the problem lies with this game.  Since you cannot control your ships, you can't stock them up.  Plus there is a pause between building ships, so your ships are sent out one at a time and usually get killed.  It's a bad design choice IMO.\n\nGraphics and sound are okay.  Sometimes the battles are fun to watch.  You do get a few defensive weapons that you control.   You just seem to never build up enough ships fast enough to win and neither does the enemy.  I recommend this game to space combat junkies!  At the moment anyway…  I'll update this later when I spend more time with it.  I just wanted to post this real quick.\n\nIt play's really smooth on my 6 y/o Mac laptop!

I'd not call it 'bare bones' so much as admit it's a very simple game that focuses more on the planning and gameplay than anything else; that's not to say that they ignored everything else, but you can easily see what their best aspect is.\n\nDifficulty-wise, I'd say it's too easy. I like a challenge now and again, and the thing here is that with a simple game comes a simple A.I. - one that needs a bit of a boost (resource-wise) to keep up with an actual planning player (and will nearly always still fall short to one who's actually on their feet and assiging commands properly). That's not to say the game's not fun - there's still a simple satisfaction in playing it and seeing your amassed army do the dirty work for you.\n\nAchievements-wise, this game will take you a while. It's rather easy to hit 100% since the story mode is a glorified tutorial and introduction (with smatterings of plot, I guess) and the career achievements are really ones that would take you a fair bit of time. It wont even take you that long to come up with a winning build that could consistently win you games at 4-5minutes each and it's just a matter, then, of putting in the hours.\n\nOverall, I would recommend it. It's simple but good, and the for the price, matches expectations.","December 15, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you don't make the correct ships at the right time, then it can cost you a lot of wasted resources, and an injection of resources or energy from your destroyed ships.\n\nIt still needs work, though. For one, the tutorial is just an extremely basic overview of everything, and the actual tutorial is in the campaign. So I would recommend to make the CURRENT "campaigns" into the tutorials, and make the campaigns more difficult as you progress, with maybe even some changes in rules sometimes to give some missions a bit more of a challenge. It would also be great for tooltips to exist, or at least a "library" of sorts with each ship's information. Perhaps give the game some more visual flair to make it look better.\n\nAll in all, it's still a pretty good game. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a rather cheap game with a rather simple concept and some little bits of fun.

Nice and short, just like Aeon Command.\n\nIf you've ever played one of those flash games where you make units and they move across the map and attack your enemy, then you've played Aeon Command. I wouldn't call this a bad game. It's definitely not my favourite, nor does it have the strategic complexity that I prefer, but for only $3.29 on Steam, it did provide me more than 3 hours of entertainment. Granted, once I figured out how to beat the game... most of the rest of the time was spent farming wins until I could get the last research only because I wanted the last achievement.\n\nThis game is simple, and that's not a bad thing. It's meant to be a simple "tug 'o war"-type game and it's done really well. If you're looking for something more hardcore and intense, then this game won't be for you. However, if you're looking for a cheap casual way to spend a little bit of time, then I would give this game a recommendation, especially if you can get it on sale.\n\nI'll give this game 8/10 for this type of game.\n\n~ Kyle","September 17, 2015","true","27.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Took me around 4-5 hours to go through the campaigns but it was very pleasant. Plan to definitely play more now and then.\n\nThis game does the "hands-off" -approach well - instead of microing you need to think about the fleet composition and when exactly to launch your ships and how many/what kind. For example, ships in a cluster kill targets fast and don't really take much damage in return..but certain ships have AOE-abilities that really hurt clusters. There is also the question of whether to research upgrades or to send out un-upgraded ships faster. The activated abilities require good timing to get the maximum value out of.\n\nI felt like the difficulty only really picked up some in the last campaign, so I think the campaigns could have been harder and/or have couple more "hard" missions near the end.
