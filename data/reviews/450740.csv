They say it is in “BETA” for Vive and should be fixed shortly. The height control is off to the point it is impossible to aim below you because your head is in the ceiling. I have tried out about 40 games for the vive and this was probably tied for first on the nausea factor due to: simultaneous head movement and mouse movement, as well as the 45-degree jerk left/right with q/e (especially when trying to turn around on an enemy. The alarms in-between waves are also a bit loud and I could understand a lot of people being deterred by the pitch and volume of the alarm warning.\n\nOn the bright side before I had to exit the game in the second wave due to nausea the game did seem to have some redeeming qualities with the jetpack and ammo replenishing that requires you to keep moving around finding enemies. I wish I could have gotten to try out some of the harder waves and the other two classes, but it was too much for me. Headset aiming was very responsive and accurate I think I would like this shooting style if I hadn't gotten nauseous. This is the first Vive game I have had to refund.\n","May 5","false","0.2"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","9"

Nice aesthetic, responsive controls, FUN flying.  What has impressed me most is how responsive and quick the dev is to fix bugs.  At its price, you can't go wrong with this game.  If you have an issue, tell the dev and it will likely be fixed within the next 2 days!","May 9","true","0.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

But that's because I get really fast motion sick while playing this game just for minutes.\n\nThe game itself is fast pacing and looks nice. People which aren't much affected by motion sickness will this game.\n\nA Teleport function would be great for VR.","June 5","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm not sure if you are limited on how many times you can place turrets or if it was a glitch, or if the game was just lacking on-screen information.\n- There needs to be more variety in weapon pickups, and enemy types\n- It seemed like movement was limited to an extent. It was hard to dodge enemy fire, and I felt like the game was a tad too challenging early on, mainly because I was constantly running out of ammo.\n\nOverall, it's up to you to determine if this would be a good VR experience or not.","May 19","false","5.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","5"

This is by all means a small budget-game shooter, with the added value of running in VR. All in all it's an ok experience.\n\nPros\n1) Has potential to be a simple straight up shooter.\n2) Cool hover mechanic\n3) Simple way to introduce yourself to first person VR\n\nCons\n1) Shields and screens and effects 3 inches from your face that result you in not seeing the gameplay at all\n2) Out of ammo simulator; the game should most definitely give incentive on finding guns not by running out of ammo but rather by having more strength desparity in some rarer weapons.\n3) Incredibly basic AI; they come for you. Sometimes too quickly and they bunch up. Lots of behind-the-player sneaking.\n4) Some frame dips on higher quality levels\n\nThis game is said to be developed specifically for VR. I had doubts on this when facing the pitch axis issue which is an obvious no-no for VR, and still question the nature of the shield effects, but all in all I was able to give it a few rounds through the first waves which yielded some enjoyable moments.","May 9","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","7"

Very simple but fun.  However the level of nausea is pretty high, I could only manage a few minutes.
