I am in the position to be able to rightly judge the quality to the good old days, and played enough rpg maker to realize the lazy games from the good ones so I hope you think of my point of view as a fair one.\n\nThis developer makes quality on par with the past consoles.  The usual problem with rpg maker is that the gameplay is stale and the character personalities are paper thin.  However, this dev went out of his way to make a unique combat system based on holding aggro with heavy armor characters that would easily be loved were it made on the old consoles and actually took the time to create and develop characters.  The story is good and unpredictable, the gameplay is solid, and the music is surprisingly catchy.  There are bad rpg maker games, and there are good ones. This one is great. Highly recommended.","January 21, 2015","true","37.5"," 52 of 58 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","52","58","2","0"

First off I would like to state this is an RPGmaker title and gameplay wise it plays like Phantasy Star/FF series.   For an RPGmaker game I have been truly impressed.\n\nIt has your standard leveling up system but with a few different things that change it from the original formula.  For example you get skill points through gaining levels, completing side quests/main quests and monster nodes which you can collect in dungeon areas.   You use the skill points to learn various abilities for each person in your party.   Also there are 9 skills and 3 passives for each character in your party and each skill can have be leveled 1 to 5.  So with one character in my party I focused on her fire spells and dark magic, yet if I wanted to I could have went Lightning/Frost or the many other combos which are possible with her.   I personally feel you can choose any skills and make it through the game.(healing magic is a must though!)\n\nThe story is alright.   There are some actual parts where I was really into it; taking this base over or defending a castle(Trying not to spoil anything there)   What I do like is that alot of the dialoge feels mature and well written.   Except with some of the characters. They seem like the average comedy relief anime people which to me felt generic.   Other then that it is pretty solid I'd say.\n\nThe graphics are your classic SNES era or equivalent.   I personally like old games since they old a nostalgic charm over me.   Overall I would recommend this to any person who enjoys a good JRPG.","June 5, 2014","true","10.8"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

There seems to be quite a few side-quests, an arena, a slot machine, and a poker minigame, so there's plenty to do if the main quest bores you, and the dialog is well-written. It plays like a Dragon Quest game (with a 7th Sagaesque back-view for combat) with a well-written cast, intriguing story, and fun battle mechanics. And best of all, there's a visual Threat meter! One of the better RPG Maker games I've played.","June 1, 2014","true","11.4"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

I neevr thought this day would acually come alas it has. I havent finished the game but from the looked of it and from the other reviews im not even close.\n\nHere is a taste of what you would get if you were to get this game(its always under £1 on ♥♥♥ so its a steal).\n\nIts very well polished, no mistakes in grammer or spelling\nCharecters are well thought out and consistent\nAdult humor, not to the nsfw zone but its funny in its own way, its like they are not going for the in your face borderlands style of humor which is great as ive not played a game like that for a while.\nOld school rpg well everything.\n\nThere are a few nic nacs that may be a problem, my biggest issue that is i cant use wasd for movement, it has to be arrows or the numberpad, im not creating macros for this game as that is effort.\n\nRPG maker locks a game at 640x480 which is pathetic to be honest, they have software limitations, you can fullscreen it however if you have multiple monitors then its a problem, i normally watch netflix while playing a game, if i with to fullscreen which of course i do then i cant watch netflix on my second monitor due to the painful scaling.\n\nThe main storyline isnt the most spectacular story ever however its good enough to keep you interested, it certainly is rather retro and i cant complain about that.\n\nWhile you could say that its casual if you turn up the difficulty the game will reach out of the monitor and backhand you in the face, enemies seem to vary from doing next to no damage to Ruby died, its always Ruby.\n\nSkill trees actually matter in this game with is awesome and allows you to change your play style accordingly, all of the charecters have their roles and it plays out well.\n\nTeresa has nice leg muscles.","March 29, 2015","true","16.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

This game is so much better than the original in so many ways!  Nearly everyone can be a big time damage dealer, the difficulty curve though present is nowhere near how it was in the original, only the final boss gave me any real trouble.  The only downside is you HAVE to make sure you use your skill point boost crystals cause you have VERY limited item space I believe you can only carry 20 of an item at most.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tekanji/recommended/285420/","tekanji","Miss Andri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tekanji/","186 products in account","As others have said, this game is a pretty solid old-school RPG. Overall I found this game to be fairly well balanced, with no grinding necessary on normal difficulty. The dungeons were overall well laid out, with interesting puzzles and not so long to get tedious. The story was decent, although the writing was unpolished and could have benefited from some good editing. I liked the quest system, but thought it was under utilized, and the Monster Node system is something I would love to see implemented in other games. The skill trees were an interesting addition, but I felt that the skills and equipment didn't always work well together and both could have been better balanced. The mouse system was also not as polished as it could be, which led to many frustrating miss clicks throughout the game.\n\nWhile I think the game is worth buying, I can't recommend this game for full price because it has some big bugs. Most are only slight annoyances (like a door leading to the wrong place when you go back through it), but the Phoenix Feather augment, which should give the Regen ability, instead gives Innverterate. Since the game came out in 2010 and this bug is known, I think it's fairly egregious for Dancing Dragon Games not to have issued a patch fixing this.","August 17, 2014","true","26.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeuGamer/recommended/285420/","HeuGamer","HeuGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeuGamer/","54 products in account","The game is so good.\n\nGameplay:\nThe battle system is well done, and makes you want to fight the enemies instead of retreating (because if you want to run you'll have some consequences) and you'll never see yourself pressing attack and attack over and over, overall the battles were engaging and tatical.\n\nOn the otherhand, outside of the battles were these mazes... and I will say the first few 'dungeons' they were pretty fun and challenging to get around and find the correct ways, but as the game progresses through these dungeons they just keep getting worst and more repeated... I found myself towards the end of the game with this scenario, "I found the exit, oh wait but where's the quest item!?". I felt towards the end of the game, the dungeons were rushed and almost had no sense of directions. I won't lie, but I just walked to random area till I eventually got to an exit.\n\nSide quests were very well worth. The leveling/equiping system was very exciting and fun to play around on which build I wanted on each character.\n\n**Gameplay - 7/10**\n\nGraphics/Audio:\nAudio was pretty good, I really didn't listen to it most of the time, but I do believe they had the same sound track for almost every dungeon(I may be wrong). Battle music were alright, nothing memorable although, but nothing to complain about.\n\nGraphics were pretty good, the mapping they did in this game was top-notch, not sure if they used parallaxing at all, and if they didn't I applaud them. I thought the maps were really well done, espically the towns for their simplistic layout and directions (knowing where things are).\n\n**Graphics/Audio - 8/10**\n\nStory:\nThe story was ehh... I mean it seemed pretty cliche at some moments, but I think if you were to play a cliche rpg, this game would be the one. I say that there were SOME cliche moments, but those were only SOME moments, overall the story of the game was compelling and dynamic, but I did feel the character development was sometimes at a lost, also I did feel there were some questions to be asked. The story was decent, nothing memorable or different, but I mean it was still a great story.\n\nDialogue was GREAT, very good. Funny moments were funny, serious moments were serious. You could tell by the dialogue and I think the creator did a great job taking words and creating a tone with it. Very well done.\n\n**Story - 7/10**\n\nOverall the game was pretty well done. Dialogue really helped set the tone of the game which helped the somewhat cliche story and characters. Battles were very tatical and engaging, as well as for the quest. The game does some things that are just incredible, but does some things that are just straight out annoying, which killed my experience with the game and the story.\n\nIn the end although, I would recommend this game for any RPG fans.\n\n**Overall - 7.5/10**","June 1, 2014","true","14.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Very classic feel, though with some more modern systems to mix it up\n- a threat system, augments, and a skill system.\n\nIt's a good, solid length (took me about 20 hours, including optional stuff) with an interesting storyline (with some welcome trope changes - the empire isn't evil!).  I enjoyed most of the characters, although the protagonist himself was a bit too emo for my taste.  The paladin was a great example of a female character done right, as well.\n\nI very much appreciated the fact that the skill system was resettable, since making binding choices with skills can be a real drag in RPGs.  Skill points can be reset at any inn for free, as many times as you want.  This lets you switch up who's tanking based on available characters/current gear, as well as try different playstyles if you so feel.\n\nDefinitely recommended.\n\nI also enjoyed this developer's other RPG on Steam, Skyborn, and I'll be keeping an eye out for any future offerings of theirs.

I liked the combat system: it's remniscent of FFX's turn-based time system, but they added threat so that only the person with the highets threat ever gets attacked. It works great. The only gripe I have is that the mage's skill tree is very bland; it's three skills that are exactly the same single-target nuke except with different elements, and then another three skills that are aoe--the same, except for elements. Beating everything on hard and getting all end-game items, killing all optional bosses on the hardest settings, etc. took me about 25 hours so it's a short game; you could probably rush the story in 10-15 hours on normal.

Also, some quest discriptions could have given more information of where to go.\n- Little augment explanation. More specifically, no note of which augments give what benefit in the Item menu.\n\nCombat is quite complex, and some battles seem to require that your team is maxed out in the areas that you use them in. If you're willing to go though and look at the numbers then that's fine but if you're a more casual player, pehaps that isn't too interested in combat and is more interested in the story, then this might not be the game for you.\n\nPersonally I found some of the quests hard to find, let alone complete, and had to turn to google to find out where I was meant to be in order to progress.\n\nThe augment system is very well done, it forms a central part of the combat and items. It must have taken quite a bit of work to put in and it is obvious that it wasn't just something that was tacked on. Though the feature was well designed, I personally found it added unnecessary complexity.\n\nOverall, I think the game is well made.

You cant just keep hitting enter and win the battle you have to strategize to keep the threat on your tank characters otherwise your weaker defense characters will die too fast. I enjoyed how i got to choose the skills i wanted to learn and not preset ones that you get by leveling up. The only problem  i really had with this game was when i was running the game was laggy and at a certain point in the game the battles became delayed/laggy.","June 20, 2015","true","11.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If run in full screen mode, which isn't really, being only about half the normal resolution of a modern monitor, about 640/480, then you are subjected to an annoying and persistent flickering screen the entire game that does not go away.  The only fix, so far, is to not run the game in full screen, which eliminates the flickering but then the game only runs in a tiny window, about the size of the standard steam chat window, and you can't stretch it or make it any bigger.  So yeah, only two choices, either play with the annoying flicker, or play with a magnifying glass.  Not even worth it as a bargain deal, since I only payed 5 bucks and still feel like I got ripped off and deserve a refund for an unplayable game.","June 22, 2014","false","0.4"," 10 of 29 people (34%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","34","10","29","0","4"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #44 - Deadly Sin 2\n\nI've always had a bit of a soft spot for JRPG games.  My first introduction to a JRPG was back on the Super Nintendo.  A friend of mine loaned me his copy of Final Fantasy II (actually IV but the US numbered them different than Japan).  I had no idea what I was in for.  I must have sank 50 hours into that game.  I don't remember any other game on the SNES I put as much time into, and I loved every minute of it.\n\nNow thanks to the advent of RPG Maker, there are quite a few JRPG games to be found, such as this one.  RPG Maker is really a mixed bag.  I love it as a concept, and I think anything that makes it easier for people to make games is a good thing.  But the flip side to this is that you also end up with a lot of content out there, and that content is not necessarily very good.  When it's easy to crank out your own JRPG, it also means that it's easy to make it very cookie-cutter and not very interesting.\n\nI think there are 2 big areas you really need to stand out as a JRPG.   One of the hallmarks of a JRPG is frequent combat, which can quickly feel repetivive and grindy.  Anything that helps set the combat apart from your standard turn-based options can help make the game stand out.  But what really makes or breaks a JRPG is the storyline.  Without a good story to really bind all of the combat and other encounters together, things can quickly get boring.\n\nSo it's nice to see that Deadly Sin 2 succeeds in both of these fronts.\n\nI'll start with the story.  It's hard to really judge the story from playing just an hour of the game, but I enjoyed what I went through.  The first thing I appreciated was getting a simple introduction to the game, without getting clobbered over the head with an exposition dump.  Instead the game takes some time to introduce each of the characters that will end up in your party.  It starts by using a frequently seen storytelling method of starting in a bad situation (and thus an introduction to battle), followed by a jump back in time, to tell the story of how you eventually end up in that situation.\n\nI liked the main characters, and enjoyed some of the banter between them as I explored the starting town.  The town also contains a university where you can get a little more of an extended tutorial on how to play the game.  I actually like the way this is broken out.  The prologue of the game forces you to fight, so you immediately get introduced to the very basics of combat.  But by keeping the university separate, you're not forced to go through a tutorial each time you start a new game.\n\nGraphically the game looks nice.  It felt like something I would have played on my SNES.  My only complaint is the complete lack of any graphics options.  I set my expectation bar pretty low for 2D games, but the game gives you no options at all.  I did figure out that I could hit Alt-Enter to go into windowed mode, but the window is very small (relative to my 1920x1080 desktop), and the game does not let you resize the window, or set the resolution in game.\n\nCombat looked like your standard JRPG turn based combat, but with some additions.  Characters have a standard attack, and can use items or skills.  Skills vary for each character, with a mix of offensive, defensive, utility, and passive abilities.  I liked the fact that you can customize the skills for each character, through the use of skill points.  Combat also includes a threat meter, so you can see which character is going to get attacked next, and the game provides skills to allow you to manage threat level.  It definitely adds a little more to the typical turn based combat I am used to.\n\nAnother neat addition to this game that I liked is the concept of Monster Node crystals.  You collect these in different areas, and it serves a dual purpose, both to give you a bonus for finding it, as well as letting you deactivate random encounters in that area.  I like this mechanic of being able to turn off random encounters, but without it being like a cheat code.  The first one I found was in a dungeon and I had to clear most of the floor before I found it.\n\nBy the time I ended my first hour, I had just added my 3rd party member (out of 4) after making it through a couple of dungeon levels.  I really enjoyed my first hour and this definitely seems like a fun little romp.  One last note, I don't know anything about Deadly Sin 1, but the way this game starts, I didn't get any kind of impression like I needed to know anything about the first one.  I get the impression it's more like Final Fantasy where the games are all completely independent.\n\nIf your idea of an RPG is more along the lines of Skyrim or Dragon Age, then you might want to give this one a pass, especially if you are turned off by lots of reading.  But if you like JRPGs you will feel at home here, even if you are normally turned off by RPGMaker games.","December 9, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
