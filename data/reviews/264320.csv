The backgrounds are great, the character art's cute and engaging, the voice acting's better than I expected and the puzzles and gameplay are pretty good. There's a few minor hiccups like items the character won't take until she knows she need it (I hate that!) and one or two complex puzzles that seem to get slightly buggy if you don't do things in precise order. Overall though, these flaws were very minor and don't detract from the gameplay. There are also a few minigames just for variety, but nothing anybody will find overly taxing. These can be skipped if so desired.\n\nThis game is a modern point-and-click adventure game. That means relatively limited interface options and relatively few interactable items per screen. This is a fairly good example of the genre, but if you're not a fan of point-and-click adventure, this won't be the game to change your mind.","January 4, 2014","true","9.5"," 155 of 175 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","155","175","0","6"

You just have to overcome the first chapter, after that the game is getting better and better. Captain Morgane and the Golden Turtle is a classic point and click adventure game. The story isn't that good but still adventurous. The backgrounds and the characters are very beautiful. I played the english version and I gotta say I really liked the dialogues and the voice acting. Especially Morganes spanish accent. There are lots of references to the modern pop culture during the entire game. I had some funny moments. In my opinion, the game is a little too childish sometimes. Be aware of that. I think I don't have to tell anything detailed about the story. It's already written in the game description.\n\n\npros and cons:\n\npros:\n- beautiful locations/backgrounds\n- cute characters\n- voice acting (Important: This refers to the english version! The german voice acting on the\nother hand is one of the worst synchronization I've ever heard)\n- low price!\n- funny references to other games, movies and books (Battlestar Galactica, Steve Jobs, so\nBlonde...)\n- not the best but still an entertaining story (I mean after chapter 1)\n\n\ncons:\n- tiring beginning (especially chapter 1)\n- rather easy puzzles\n- you have to click left mouse button after each dialogue line to continue the dialogue\n\n\nAfter all, Captain Morgane is not such a bad game.

The puzzles are uninteresting, but when you complete one and talk to a character about it, they still try to give you clues about that same puzzle.

No scene is the same or resembles any other scene in the game.\n+Music that fits the game perfectly and doesn’t try to sound overpowering.\n+Fully voiced dialogue – well rehearsed and done nicely by the cast who did the voices.\n+No Crashes and/or Bugs that I am aware of.\n+Pirates, treasure, and an adventure!\n\n\nCons:\n\n-No options in the menu. All you can do is change the voice dialogue and text of the language to English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish.\n-Resolution did not match that of my native resolution (had black bars on both sides of the actual gameplay, but the screenshots show in full resolution).\n-The animation of the actual characters on the screen could have used a lot more polish. I would say some of the characters would compare well with some PlayStation 2 characters.\n\n\nThis is my first Point and Click adventure game. It was a fun little game and it was enjoyable. The puzzles and combination of items weren’t difficult even though at times there were some tricky ones. The game had some flaws, but nothing game breaking. I didn’t experience any bugs, crashes, or anything of similar nature.\n\nThe story was decent and it introduced some funny, wacky characters along your adventures. The cast did a nice job on voice acting and from what I’ve read and heard on the forums, the original voices were replaced with new voices that matched the actual characters (hearing the first video to the third video on the actual store page is a HUGE difference – big plus on my end!). There are some nice jokes and a few Easter Eggs within the text.\n\nThe theme of the game is around the Caribbean Sea. You’re a young pirate woman who wants to prove to everyone that you can be the next best pirate captain. You have a lot of obstacles and convincing of others in order to make this dream happen. You’ll encounter rivals and haters who will want to end your dreams. There are some moments where the female protagonist has to help others out on their own personal agenda in order to progress further on her own adventure (this gives a bit more background story on those individual characters that help you along your journey).\n\nAs long as you have an open mind, don’t hate pirates, know that this isn’t a RPG; like treasures and an adventure – I would recommend this game to anyone who likes point and click games. I did enjoy this game and would give a 7/10.\n","October 11, 2015","true","11.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

Let me start with what is bad about this game. First, the story wanders all over the place and about 1/2 half of it could have been cut without any serious damage to the plot. Further, while there is a villian in the game he gets no character development. Second, the game relies on too many puzzles that are tedious--there is a place in the game where a written confession is needed and there are ten steps required to make the confession from producing the ink to getting a writing insturment. It takes a certain degree of patience to make it through Captain Morgane. My own strategy was when I found the game boring I started looking at a walkthrough until  the game seemed to pick up speed.\n\nSo what is good about the game? First, although the story wanders it does feature some nice plot twists. There is a genuine sense of adventure and of the unexpected. Second, the game flashes some moments of genuine humor. I won't spoil all of them but I'll mention one snarky bit, "She had the type of face that lauched a 1000 ships. That's why it looked so battered." ZING. There is even a Star Trek reference. Third, some of the characters one meets in the game are well-defined. The heroine of the game--Captain Morgane--is well-crafted as well as some of the minor characters. Finally, the game is nice to look at.\n\nOverall, I found playing this game fun. True it doesn't rival Broken Sword or The Longest Journey but it's still is an above average adventure game. It took me about nine hours to finish and I don't regret the time spent.\n\n","June 12, 2014","true","5.4"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

As her father gives her command of the ship for her birthday, Morgane accepts a charter to seek out the legendary Golden Turtle by following a trail of clues the famous explorer Buckleberry Tanner left behind him.\n\nPros: The point & click genre is well represented as you pick up a whole assortment of objects and trinkets on your adventure, using them and combining them in creative and often funny ways to progress in the story. You come across a couple of strange or wacky characters on your adventure, and there's a few out-of-place reference to other games and movies in a hit-and-miss attempt to mimic the humor found in golden age Sierra and LucasArts games. The voice acting is ok, at least for the most part, and backgrounds look like the caricatural hand drawn style you'd expect. The story is child-friendly, and you must keep in mind that it's likely the target audience of the game as there is little to no jokes, not even subtle ones, targeted at a more mature audience.\n\nCons: The 3D spites of people clash strongly with the 2D cartoony background, and I'm not convinced it was the best choice. The story is short, and the puzzles aren't enough to make it the lengthy experience a Monkey Island or Space Quest game would be. Some jokes are corny even for children, I wouldn't even expect any giggle from a younger player.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nI'll recommend this for younger players looking for slightly challenging puzzles, but adults will find it easy and perhaps even a bit of a boring tale. It doesn't quite reach the levels of other point & click, but although I'm not the player this game is for, it still gets an "ok" from me.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","December 26, 2015","true","16.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It took around 14 hours to beat (perhaps less, some people say 8). The game isn't really too hard and there is no way to lose really. It's got some charming characters. The writing isn't always funny but at least it tries to be. The story isn't too bad, in fact it was somewhat refreshing. I guess this game has ties to another game from the same writer/developer called "So Blonde" but it's not on steam. Someone greenlight it! The game even has voice acting and for the most part they do a solid job.\n\nI liked the 2D artwork, the 3D however leaves something to be desired. Also, not too fond of how the same character will look off model in a different piece of artwork, like in the cut scenes Morgane will look off. Sometimes they look odd even in the character portraits in the dialogue. Another thing that would be desirable would be steam achievements. It appears the Playstation version has trophies so it is odd the steam version doesn't have something similar. It does have cards though!\n\nOverall if you're into point and click games, female protagonists and lighthearted stories you should probably check this out.","January 11, 2015","true","14.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It took me about 18 hours, so those people who claim to have finished this in 6 hours can only have used walkthroughs.\n\nThere are 10 chapters and each chapter progresses the story very nicely.\n\nWhat I loved about this title was the dialogue, which was funny and made perfect sense. The voices of the many characters were all really well done and very much added to the atmosphere. Some of the characters are particularly brilliant, such as the debonnaire but daft Briscoe, the fabulous Buck who reminded me of so many people I've met in SE Asia (the developers really nailed that character), Sonia is the most hilarious and cagey dock side 'worker' ever, and of course the lead character, Morgaine, is a superb act. There are many more great and wacky characters that will be encountered that really do a great job.\n\nThe story is very interesting and really gets going in chapter 2. I have seen reviews criticising chapter 1, but it's a cute, short introductory chapter and great for story background. and takes about 45 minutes to playthrough. The ultimate quest, introduced by the eccentric English gentleman, Briscoe, is always the aim, though the journey there will take many twists and turns with lots of side quests.\n\nI don't want to give away any of the plot, but I'll just say that the way the story dealt with a sad death was very touching indeed and one of the peaks of the title.\n\nThe graphics are bright and colourful and their cartoony style do the story lots of justice. Well done to the graphics team.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly fetch quests, dialogue threads and inventory matching. While these are mostly fun and do require thought and LOTS of experimentation, it would have been nice to have thrown in some other types of puzzles too. The few mini game type puzzles are on the weak side,\n\nI liked the control system of clicking the dialogue to move it on as that way I didn't miss any important information and it allowed me to read it while listening, at my own speed. A good system. The inventory, as mentioned above, does require a lot of trial and error, but is perfectly fine.\n\nSo, overall, I really enjoyed this game, though I was not sure I would before I started playing it. I would strongly recommend it for  15 plus very entertaining hours (if played with no hints).","May 1, 2015","true","18.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

Everything is made for only you can't play it smoothly and spend more time in game. The only beautiful thing about this game is backgrounds which is very nice.

Seriously i thought the opening was like a dirty scene where the blonde guy rams the captain and he starts crying. I still don't remember anyone falling overboard. They really needed voices on the cutscenes or a decent narration. The rest of the game is ok but I feel the story is weak. For example when a fire started on a rug nobody tries to put it out but escape instead via a locked door when there were windows and possibly backdoors. Besides the story I also dislike the inventory screen. I hate it when i have to connect two items on different pages. I wished they would've made more inventory spaces per page and pull everything down as I used it. The worst part is that I didn't see the save function, which is a door on the inventory/options, so I left thinking it autosaves when you see the scroll icon after a quest finishes or begins. Still the game is decent for five dollars. I also notice many tie-ins to popular shows like Spongebob Squarepants and My Neighbor Totoro.","August 21, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Probably.\n\nI mean, don't get me wrong, I got it as a gift and had it on my wishlist because I thought another adventure game with a female protagonist would be cool.\n\nHowever, it feels like it was written haphazardly and the art style is...well.\n\nI feel they may have underpaid their artists.\n\nThe minigames make me wonder if this is supposed to be a kid's game, but the quality (especially of the sword fight; the graphics literally made me want to stop playing the game, and using ctrl and alt?  What is this?  There are many other keys that are good for sword fighting that are not related to system functions like z and x or a and s!) is a little disgusting in that respect.\n\nEither way, it is not horrible game.  It suffers from usual adventure game problem of trying to grind everything on your inventory with every other thing in your inventory and everything in the environment, but that is normal.\n\nI would not get this for a friend even if they loved adventure games unless they were truly desperate, but it is good enough that I can actually play it.\n\nWait for a sale.","January 10, 2015","false","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm a fan of point-and-click adventure games and if someone were to tell me this is a game that came out in 1998, I would believe you as it feels right at home there. Like adventure games of that era, you've got funny and obscure solutions to problems and even a handful of minigames thrown in (with a surprisingly chibi style in a few of them). As it has been noted by others, for some reason the game does not start with a setup menu or even has a good one in-game. HIGHLY recommended to run "settings" in the captain morgane steam folder (common standard being steam/steamapps/common/captainmorgane) and you can then adjust it for higher qualitiy and widescreen mode.\n\nI found the acting to be very good. None of the performances took me out of the atmosphere and all of the accents felt like they belong there. The music was excellent and I enjoyed all of the soundtrack even if it was a bit repetetive. Like the games of the 90's, though, that was fairly common and since it is caribbean themed and light it doesn't get annoying.\n\nOther than a few minor bugs here and there, this was an adventure game worth playing if you're into adventure games. Since Monkey Island always has a soft spot in my heart, any pirate-themed adventure game set in the caribbean will spark my interest. :)\n\nTL;DR - Good adventure game for anyone looking for a pirate style point-and-click adventure.
