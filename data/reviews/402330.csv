Well, All Seeing Eye Games does and has packed "Press X to Not Die" full of them, along with a bit of self-referential humor and even some current industry tropes along the way.\n\nLike the games from decades past that it undoubtedly draws upon, Press X to Not Die casts YOU as the protagonist in a world that has all of a sudden gone mad.  In true "Interactive Movie" style, the video scenes that follow as the story progresses are shot from your perspective and characters in the game address you directly.  At certain points, you will be presented with a situation that requires a button press (or combination thereof) within a specific time frame depending on the difficulty selected.  At other times, the player selects from a dialog tree or similar to keep things moving.  Though these interactions represent the entirety of the gameplay, the approach here is faithful to the FMV games of yore.  Additionally, the developers have done a fine job of interjecting humor (self-deprecating and otherwise) into the proceedings.\n\nOn the standard difficulty, I was able to get through the entirety of the game in just about a half an hour on the first go through with minimal deaths.  While I was a little surprised to have seen the ending that soon, the length of Press X to Not Die is commensurate with the price of admission.  There also exists the possibility of replaying the game several times, whether it be at a higher difficulty or to intentionally not press the required buttons or make different choices to see how the alternate video scenes play out.\n\nIn all, Press X to Not Die succeeds as a throwback to a genre that left the spotlight as quickly as it entered it over 20 years ago.  It also succeeds as a tongue in cheek reference regarding why those games had limited appeal and short shelf lives.  Regardless of which one is more prevalent, Press X to Not Die succeeds and is worthy of a purchase.","October 30, 2015","true","4.1"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","27","33","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/402330/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPress X to Not Die is an indie comedy FMV[en.wikipedia.org] game that is fun, but is weighted down with quite a few flaws.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:A crazy person is trying to kill you! What should you do? Your friend tells you to press X and you get to live. He presses X too late and he dies. You soon find out that this was not an isolated case as the streets are full of people trying to kill the ones that are healthy. You have to use your reflexes to avoid dying, getting hit and other things.\n\nPros:    Comedy | I had to admit that I had quite a few laughs while playing this. Although the acting was not the best I've seen, I'm pretty sure it was intentional (at least to some degree) and it's able to make you laugh, if you're not too demanding.\nThe Gameplay | There are three things you can do in the game: you can choose what to say in a dialog, you have to use reflexes to dodge a punch or to hit someone and you have to mash buttons to run or climb fences. This is actually one of the best things in this game. There are also different difficulties, the higher the difficulty, the more buttons you have to press at the same time.\nProduction | There are a lot of short clips put together to form this game and whoever was in charge of coordination and planning did a wonderful job. There are multiple clips which are different every time you die and that really adds another level of quality to the story.\nGamepad and Keyboard Support | Although this game was meant to be played on a controller, the developers added a setting to play with your keyboard. The controls were ported well and you will find the gameplay enjoyable with any one of those two.\nChapter Selection | Another thing I really like is the menu in which you can choose between the unlocked chapters. This is great if you, for some reason, didn't complete the story in one sitting or if you just want to select some other text in the dialog answer selection.\nPoints System and Leaderboards | As you get points for beating the game, there is Steam Leaderboards support for this game. You also get achievements for beating the game at different difficulties.\nActive Developer | They are releasing updates frequently and they are open to suggestions. They are also planning on adding more features, such as subtitles and even more footage.\nCons:    Length of the Game | I completed this game in 25 minutes. Yes, that's right. It is recommended, however, that you play the game on more difficulties to see how far can you push your reflexes. I didn't find the story boring at all even after multiple playthroughs.\nActing Quality | Imagine a woman saying this line: "Oh, it's you. You're just in time. My roommate is trying to kill me." Now imagine her saying that half-asleep and kind of bored -- that is one example of this game's voice acting. It's not very good, if you haven't guess yet. I have a feeling that it's intentionally bad, but sometimes it's just too bad.\nPoor Steam Integration | You cannot use Steam Overlay and you can only see your newly gained achievements after you close the game. Clunky. This was fixed with the latest update. Good job, developers!\nInstability | When I was playing it, this game crashed a few times and one of the results of this was a lost achievement. Not a big deal, though, as this seems to be occurring rarely.\nThe final verdict:I had a hard time deciding how to grade this game, but I decided that all the positive sides outweigh the negative ones. It's true that the acting is bad and the whole game is short, but I really liked it and I can't wait for the next episode! I'm not sure whether the price is appropriate or not, but the game is going to be updated with more content, anyway. I hope that the next episode will be given to current owners for free and not as a DLC or a separate game, as this would really not please people who thought that this episode was too short (everyone).\nI recommend this if you're looking for a quick laugh and are not too demanding when it comes to acting quality.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

Because sometimes it's not about what you do, it's about how you do it, and these guys and gals are doing it right. (No greenscreen scenes.) This can only get better if they add ninjas for the sequels.\n\nVery much recommended.

The game is a nice throwback to older games of this nature. Stuck in a world where everyone seems to have gone mad, you have to find away to not die through button mashing on your keyboard or controller. The game is a fun experience that can definitely raise your adrenaline, don’t blink or relax because you never know when you’ll have to press X!\n\nStoryThe game starts off like any normal day, that is until your friend rushes over stating that everyone is attacking each other and you have to press X to not die. From that point on you’re thrust into a world where your survival depends on your reaction time.  But don’t worry, you’ll be dying a lot and actually this is the best part. All of the deaths are absurd as is the game itself. You have to rescue your girlfriend, find answers and get out of town in one piece all of this action packed fun is also helped with ridiculous dialogue which is funny and also meta. Don’t worry about the fourth wall, it’s been destroyed.\n\nGameplayAs the name of the game states, you have to press X to not die. The game works very well using a game controller, however you can also use your keyboard if you like. The game pretty much consists of button mashing action sequences and dialogue choices. Fear not, the game offers a challenge. You have four difficulty modes; easy, medium, hard and then super hard. The amount of buttons you have to press at the same time and the speed at which you have to press them changes with each difficulty.\n\nGraphics/AudioThis game uses full motion video, meaning everything you see in the game is portrayed by real actors. Every crazy death is acted out and over the top but all done very well. The cheesy humor of the game fits well with the FMV format. The user interface is a bit on the simple side, however this isn’t a huge issue. The whole game is voiced as well so no need to worry there. There isn’t much music in the game but that’s fine, it’s mainly about the action. The game gives you a first person perspective, I however had a bit of an issue with this at first. The movement of camera made me feel uncomfortable but this subsided after some play time. There is also a very retro “1994 mode” which changes the quality of the graphics to what us old farts had to deal with.\n\n\nPros+ Great FMV retro feel with good acting.\n+ Story is over the top and pretty funny.\n+ Four levels of difficulty.\n+ Good controls.\n+ Steam cards and achievements.\n\nCons- The language in this game can be rather coarse at times so beware of cursing.\n- Thumbs might get tired from all the button mashing.\n\nFinal ThoughtsAs I write this review the game is currently in the Early Access stage, however, I do feel that it’s pretty good as-is and look forward to whatever features get added when it has its full release. If you’re a fan of FMV interactive games then I highly recommend Press X to Not Die, it’s very affordable but also very short. Most of the replay value likes in collecting achievements and unlocking all of the death scenes. While this game may not be for everyone, I really enjoyed it.\n\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games to F2P games.","June 2","true","10.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","1"

I have liked FMV games for years and when I saw Press X to Not Die i had to get it. The video quality is good (amazing compared to the old games). The main reason I purchased this game was to support the developers and help give them a reason to continue doing what they are doing because pretty much nobody else is making games like this.\n\nBottom line the game is good for a chuckle and worth the few bucks they are asking for it.

I thought it would be an interesting experience. So I bought it and I'm glad I did.\n\nThis game is kinda like a tribute to those old FMV video games from the early to mid '90s like Wing Commander 3 and Night Trap. I've personally never played those kinds of games, so seeing a video game done in this way was very new to me.\nI recommend you play this game on Normal difficulty because the higher ones expect you to press about four buttons in three seconds. Unless you are going for achievements of course.\nIt's a very short game, but satisfying in many ways. The acting is pretty cheesy which I enjoy personally. The menus feel really well done which surprised me even.\nAnd yes this game is just quicktime events basically, but one that made me laugh through a lot of it. This game has a strange sense of humor from referring to M. Night Shyamalan to FarmVille. But it does work. I greatly appreciate the use of Kevin MacLeod music by the way, it actually fits nicely here.\n\nOverall, this is a very fun and cheap indie game that I recommend if you just want to be entertained. It doesn't have the same level of substance as most indies I've played, but it is to become a classic in the future!","November 27, 2015","true","3.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

My friend told me that the town was going crazy. He gave me advice critical to my survival... and died. At the hands of a crazy girl. His testimony had been proven in the worst possible way.\n\nI was distraught. This guy apparently cared enough about me to come all the way over to my apartment door and give me a much-needed warning and advice for my survival- and he's dead because of it.\n\nWanting to share this information, my character dialed up a number to call his girlfri- wait, WHAT!?\n\nOkay; apparently, the character I'm controlling has a girlfriend. I've been single my whole life, personally, and proudly so, but hey, to each his own.\n\n"I" call "my" girlfriend and tell her that my best friend is dead. All she does is express mild surprise- no grief, no condolences- and then casually mentions he had it coming. Oh, yay. True love.\n\n"I" resolve to go over to her house. You know, because I'm a guy who cares about the woman with whom he's intimate.\n\nI run a distance so long it wasn't even caught on a video clip to get to her house.\n\nI go in, and the first thing she does is, in a bored tone say, "My roommate's trying to kill me."\n\nHer roommate comes at her, and she sidesteps, leaving me to have to react. This, despite my discovering later that she's perfectly capable of self-defense.\n\nWell, I try to defend myself, and fail, and the crazed roommate kills me...\n\n...and what does "my" girlfriend do?\n\nCome to my aid? Nope.\n\nCall her roommate to distract her? Nope.\n\nThank me for taking a knife that was originally intended for her? Nope.\n\nAt least express some kind of distress at the occuring death of her intimate partner who ran for quite possibly an hour to make sure she's okay? Or something to show me that I meant something to her and that my sacrifice(s) for her are acknowledged and appreciated?\n\nNope. Nothing of the sort.\n\nSo, what does she do?\n\nShe just stands there casually while her roommate stabs me to death, and the last thing I hear from her is, in a haughty, sneering voice:\n\n"Okay, dying? Not helpful."\n\nIf this is what having a girlfriend is like, you hopelessly romantic/sexual idiots out there can all have it.\n\n10/10, this game reminded me why I am happily, eternally single.\n\n\nThank you for bearing with me on that. I intend to add a real review here in good time.","May 2","true","1.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","4","5","4","0"

In regards to 8-bit, there are too many colours. Or for 16-bit, the sprites aren't detailed enough. There's an inauthentic feeling that you can't shake.\n\nThat's the way I feel about this game. FMV games weren't trying to be bad. In fact, there were good FMV games. There were also just some that were hilariously bad, but they were hilarious because they didn't know better. There was an earnest attempt. A bad movie made by someone who thinks he's talented is better than a movie that's trying to take the piss despite the person knowing they could do better. (Although I have doubts about that if this game is anything to go by.)\n\nSome of the camera shots are just subpar or low quality. Like one scene has your character staring at a blank white wall longer than necessary. Hello? Get a painting or poster or something. There was one shot that had some weird switch between day/night in the middle of a scene, like it was filmed in a single day and they didn't want to wait the extra day to film it for continuity purposes.\n\nThe make up effects feel like they're not even trying, which you know, was quite evident they weren't. Like the acting. While I'm sure there weren't robots working on this production, but if you told me there were, I'd believe you. The game talks about "dynamic dialogue", but that's not how it'll come across with actors like these. With maybe the one M. Night Shyamalan joke being kinda funny (although they spoil that in the trailer for the game so you may as well not even play it if you've watched it), the rest of the writing is full of out of place and unfunny pop culture references like Twilight and Hunger Games that don't at all fit.\n\nWhen you make me think that Family Guy of all things could handle crowbarring in references better, I think you've failed. What's more insulting to me is that there were no jokes making fun of the FMV format, let alone references to classic titles in the genre. Have any of these people even played Tex Murphy, let alone Phantasmagoria?\n\nOh, and hey guys, 1994 Mode was already done in Stay Dead Evolution, and it's more annoying than accurate. Stay Dead Evolution... now there's a bad game that wore the FMV concept proudly. SDE never tried to sell itself short with a "only kidding!" vibe that crap like this tries to. I certainly don't like Stay Dead, but I'd gladly say it's better than this.","November 2, 2015","false","0.5"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","20","37","2","5"

First time on Normal and second on Hard.\n\nMy first play through was entertaining and quite humorous - the normal mode can be difficult to someone with slower reflexes and not used to quick time events in games. The acting and dialogue comes off as trying to be ridiculous which I found entertaining.\n\nSecond play through was on hard mode and was considerably more difficult to do the quick time style events. It added more buttons and different combinations which definitely added to the challenge. There is also a higher difficulty level for the crazy people out there.\n\nThe game has a high score system integrated into Steam and measures how much of the overall "clips" you've seen or options you have chosen while going through it.\n\nIt's not a super long game, but for someone who wants to challenge the high scores and likes reflex games, it's definitely worth the low price.\n","November 2, 2015","true","130.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I reckon the old lady fighting the two people in the street was funny as she was one of the normal people and if you block the punch of the girlfriend a different dialogue occurs. I died from the stapler guy a couple of times and the clown twice as you got to be quick, This is a funny game and needs to be longer if a sequel comes should be two to three hours to be value for the money you spend, and a great fmv game the 1994 version was nice to play.\n\nI did a new game and this time left the bicycle guy and he shows up still in the end and if you don't die comments you should play on hard and goes you left him and it was cool, and sits there having milo. I think the marshollows in the milo are quite a lot and some plot holes in the game, like the room mate at Christina house not attacking her for some time until you get there.\n\nI reckon one more improvement could be having control of your character as in the game you only could choose the words and buttons, having control would make the experience better and also driving a vehicle in the next game.","October 17, 2015","true","1.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

FMV is a genre of games where the player would be given a choice to perform an action, or die. Pressing the button for a choice didn’t assure living either, you had to make the right choice, or else your character would still die. Think of the genre as a video version of a choose your own adventure book, that is linear, and a second play through is rarely ever needed.\n\nSo now that you know what you would get into with purchasing PXTND generally, how is the game itself? (TLDR at the bottom) I guess to start, the game is linear for most playthroughs, with very little variety on how the game changes based on your decisions. There are 20+ ways to die, and its fairly easy to get through the whole game. The gameplay is as such, watch the video, until the game prompts you to press a button, or a character asks you a question. If you fail to press the right button, more often than not you die, and go back approximately 20 seconds to try again. The answers you give do not seem to seem to change anything for the most part, and that’s the game. I finished it once, and to be honest, there wasn’t a reason to play again for the following reasons:\nThis is a game that lacks inspiration. Reviving a dead genre is normally done with a goal in mind, a new twist on the same old story; PXTND is not it. The story is more or less first person Dawn of the Dead, the story of how it happens is generic military scheme, and the spoken jokes are outdated pop culture references. Farmville, Twilight, Hunger games, and angry birds are the references, 4 in total that I found, and when they were not out of place (the Twilight reference was just shoehorned in), it became weirdly pretentious (accepting angry bird players, but hating on Farmville…). There were 2 visual gags that made me laugh, if you play the game you will spot them, but overall if someone is trying to sell this game to you as comedy, you will be disappointed. The few jokes are counteracted by the bad acting, which you have to sit through to get through the game.\n\nTo start about the bad acting, the game informs me in the extra’s menu that the reason why the acting is bad is because it is purposefully trying to do a callback to bad B movie acting. That is just a lie; when I hear bad B movie acting, I think of overacting, I think of overactive screams, out of place expressions, I think of campy out of place moments and over the top reactions. Don’t let the trailer fool you, the first character Matt nailed B movie. He gives a great intro, lets you know how to play the game, gets shanked, and then lets you know he forgot to press X, ♥♥♥♥ING METAL! That intro, and the fact the game was on sale, is why I purchased the game. For the rest of PXTND the acting past the intro takes a nosedive, the zombies all are doing an impersonation of DOTD zombies, and really don’t bring anything. Again, its college art movie, not B movie, so they lack direction to look like anything other than people pretending to be a zombie/crazed person. Don’t let someone sell you the line that looking like a highschooler filming their first youtube video is what they were going for. It wasn’t funny bad, it was unprepared mess. The biggest problem is the girlfriend in the games acting.\n\nThe majority of the game, the only person giving dialogue is your girlfriend. While the zombies in the game try to kill you, she tries to kill the game. No expressions outside of line reading, no emotion, not inflection, just reading the lines. A paper plate on a stick would have been preferred. She brought nothing, and while she is supposed to be the sarcastic death relief (oh you died because…) that didn’t happen. I think the writer was imagining a crazy, spunky girl as he was writing her character, and didn’t envision that someone who looks as stiff as a board through the whole game would be the choice for the lead.\n\nThis is the sort of game that reminds me to be wary of the indie community. This just isn’t good, and the people that are adamant that this is the second coming, I think just want to be part of something. It lacks wit, it is using outdated jokes, its pacing is crap, its death scenes are without humor or irony, its 1 liners are out of place, the acting is bad, and not in the fun MST3K way, and the bulk of its jokes are just pop culture references. The game ends with letting you know there is already a planned sequel, but if this was the dream project of someone to revive the FMV genre, and it lacks all of the charms that made those games great, then why would you buy an into an episodic game series that doesn’t seem to have a direction other than making a movie on their Go Pro and taking your money. This could have been shot in a day, written in a day, and programed in a day. This isn’t a passion project, it’s a small developer banking off of the indie community ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ themselves to proclaim how cool they are for playing such a unique pile of crap, that only true Scottsmen get its comedy.\n\nTLDR;\nBad, unfunny acting; Spoken jokes are all pop culture references; Story is the definition of generic; Story is pandering to how Meta gamers are... without irony; No replay-ability; Completely devoid of inspiration; Short (less than 30 minutes), with planned future episodes; Overall a black mark on the already stained FMV genre.","December 17, 2015","false","2.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The acting quality... well, if Contradiction was community theater, then this is you and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ friends playing charades, and the answer is "♥♥♥♥♥♥ acting".\n\nI guess you might enjoy that. A few of the gags actually managed to land, and the game is decently reactive - there are a few key choices you make that get referenced again, and that's kinda cute. You don't get game overs, you just restart right from the failure point, generally just seconds away from the death, which is absolutely the right way to go.\n\nThe two main issues: the game is 40 minutes long(and that's after I saw every single death scene) and the camera has an unhealthy interest in the floor and blank sections of wall. Right as the game starts, you get attacked by a not!Zombie, and you have a phone conversation with someone. Throughout the conversation, the camera is fixated on a beige wall, with nothing on it. Apparently both of these are fairly popular complaints, as the "I didn't enjoy this game" options include "too short" and "camera too high" (haha).\n\nDefinitely not worth 4$. Maybe an XBLIG sort of 1$ game.","January 12","false","2.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's missing some very basic things to make the combat feel more exciting.  When I'm punched in the face, why doesn't the camera shake?  Why doesn't the screen flash?  Why isn't there a loud cracking sound?  All of these things would be incredibly easy to add to the video footage, and they'd make combat feel much much better.  These same criticisms also apply when I punch someone else.\n\n2. The story isn't interesting at all.  It's a basic zombie scenario.  If this wasn't a videogame, I would have lost interest immediately.  How about some mystery?  How about some dramatic conflict? Shawn of the Dead did the whole zombie comedy thing, but there was a ton of drama concerning the relationships between Shawn and his girlfriend, his best friend, and his step-dad.  These things kept me engaged, and they were completely absent here.\n\n3. The QTE's shouldn't involve both mouse and keyboard.  I have pretty fast reflexes, and I played on "normal", but I messed up the QTE's that involved pressing a mouse button about 90% of the time.\n\n4. The QTE's where you have to build up a meter by continually pressing a key were way too difficult.  The challenge should be to respond quickly, not to see if I can break my keyboard by jamming a single key at an incredibly high frequency.   I'm guessing these meter challenges feel better on gamepad.\n\nSo hopefully some of that stuff can be fixed by the time this game leaves Early Access.  I wish the developers good luck.","October 13, 2015","true","0.6"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

That's a very bad flaw and I hope it gets fixed. If you don't understand how annoying this then go in an FPS game and switch your WASD keys to do the opposite, for example W is walk backwards and S is forwards, D is left and A is right.\nTry that for 30 minutes in a game like CS:GO and I bet you won't have a lot of fun.\nSorry for the rant but it troubles me that developers do not recognize this.\n\nBut, that aside, good game if you're into these kinds of games.\n\n7/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/recommended/402330/","TheGameTutor","TheGameTutor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/","3112 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe FMV genre has seen a bit of a resurgence over the last few years with the excellent Her Story and Contradiction both standing as head runners of the new age of FMV gaming. Enter Press X to Not Die a relatively short interactive movie FMV game that tries to stand up in a still relatively uncrowded genre.\n\nAt only £2.79 going in I was not expecting Casablanca but what I did get was a fun interactive movie with some silly humour and fun references that I enjoyed playing through twice. The game sees you advance through the movie pressing button presses in order to advance the story (think Dragon’s Lair) While X is a common button a decent selection of buttons are used ranging from X to Q to R to mouse buttons. In fact this game is actually harder on the PC than it was when released on Xbox a while ago.\n\nThe game is very self-aware about its shortcoming and the nature of the genre and is full of cheesy one liners and self-referential humour. In fact without spoiling too much the idea of the game is brought very much into the game’s over the top ridiculous plot. The time you get to input the commands is adjusted by the difficulty level you choose and the game’s score is given based on how well you do at these points.\n\nThe dialogue of the game changes depending on choices you make or how well you complete each section. Deaths and choices are often referred back to by the game’s actors such as chastising you for being a pervert or remarking how many times you have already died. It’s a nice touch that makes you feel like your choices do in some way matter amidst of what is by its very nature a linear game.\n\nThe game takes about 30 minutes to complete but for only £2.99 I enjoyed my time with the game and look forward to its sequel.\n\nThis review was originally posted here:  Press X to not Die Review	[www.thegametutor.co.uk]","April 20","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's an interesting twist on the zombie apocalypse scenario.\n\nPros:\n\nI loved this game and was cracking up from start to finish. The humour is great and the dialogue is clever. The acting is cheesy which perfectly fits the style of the game. The characters were all interesting and crazy in their own unique way. Full disclosure, I do have a soft spot for FMV games.\n\nCons:\n\nI played on normal and I did find the difficulty a little high and some of the key press combinations a bit tough. The death scenes were pretty entertaining so I didn't mind failing once, but I was stuck on the boss fight for a while which got a little frustrating. It's also only about 30 minutes of gameplay, although it does have some replayability and the price reflects the length (it's cheap!)\n\nConclusion:\n\nIt calls itself a B movie and that's exactly what it is - an intentionally cheesy and sometimes bizarre FMV game. Its offbeat humour and dialogue keeps it fresh and entertaining the whole way through. If that sounds like your kind of game, I'd snap it up. Also, it says it's early access but I didn't experience any bugs, anything unfinished etc. I'm guessing it's Early Access because there's only the one episode and it's designed to be episodic. Hopefully more episodes are coming!\n\nIf you want a peek at the gameplay (or proof that I really did laugh the whole way through!) check out my Let's Play:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jhfWN7tFJDs","October 15, 2015","true","1.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Unfortunately I cannot do so due to questionable business practices.\n\nFirst things first:\nI saw this game discounted in the Humble Store - 40% discount off a 3.99€ list price looked like a good deal, so I bought it. When I went to register it, I saw that the game is available on Steam for 1.99€ even without a discount. Thinking that this might have been a mistake, I contacted Humble support, who told me that they "are a separate retailer and we have separate agreements with the developers", so basically they are shifting responsibility to the developers who made the agreement with them. They also hinted at an "ability to offer content that Steam does not offer", such as DRM-free downloads, which leaves me wondering how much they have checked the actual case, because my purchase did _not_ include a DRM-free download. Sadly, the reply from Humble support gave no indication that they would actually investigate the issue.\n\nI have thus to conclude that the developers are willing to sell their game at an inflated price on some stores, even with a fake "discount" that makes the game still more expensive than what they charge for it on Steam. Since I cannot support such practices, I unfortunately cannot recommend the game (which is a pity). Since Humble support seemed unmotivated to investigate whether the price may just have been an error or oversight, I have also reached out to the developers - if this turns out to be just a mistake after all, my verdict will change.\n\nOn to the game:\n\n"Press X" is an Interactive Movie that does not take itself seriously in any way, actually it satirizes the genre\'s many shortcomings. It sports some ridiculously funny lines and events, and the acting - while not stellar - shows great timing for the comedic moments. Most of the game\'s humor is based on bizarre violence and constant breaking of the Fourth Wall, but for a 30-minute experience, that\'s good enough. The game does not overstay its welcome, and its achievement system gives incentive for a second playthrough (also a third if you want to see everything, but at this point the jokes may become a bit stale). Your choices actually do affect future options and conversations, which is very nice.\n\nThe story is on the level of the B-movies that the game took inspiration from. The camera is very shaky due to First-Person-perspective filming, gamers who are prone to motion sickness may want to check a gameplay video first. While these criteria would impact a \"serious\" game negatively, I found that they actually contributed to the fun in this parody.","June 1","false","2.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xtard/recommended/402330/","xtard","Heather Mason","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xtard/","874 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL;DR - Press X to Not Die cleverly plays with the concept of Quick-Time Events in a modern FMV medium. The student-film quality directing and acting may be more than some can bear, but beneath it all is a game with heart that just wants to make fun of itself and the mechanic it bases itself around. For $4, you can't go wrong with this piece of interactive fiction.\n\nLong version - It's no surprise that I'm a fan of the interactive fiction genre. Having written in it before and dabbled in the film aspect of it, it's nice to see I'm not alone in my love for it. Press X to Not Die takes a simple concept: the quick-time events that were first introduced to games in Dragon's Lair, and mocks it while expressing itself in the same medium that popularized it.\n\nWhile some may be put off by the nature of the game, being an FMV that aimed for B-movie sensibilities in both plot and acting, if you can see past the - as one person described it - "cringe-y" camp qualities of it, Press X to Not Die has its heart in the right place. It knows exactly what it wants to be, what it wants to say, and it isn't afraid to express itself.\n\nThe plot itself isn't by any means spectacular, but it enjoys being ridiculous. Whether you're watching an old woman karate kick a hooligan or fist-fighting a hockey player in the warehouse of a science facility, you'll have fun doing it. It's just up to you if it's post-modern "ironic" fun or genuine enjoyment brought on by the creativity of others.\n\nOn the technical side, though, the game fares a little better. Four difficulty settings are available, and each one determines the complexity of your QTEs. Easy, for example, may give you around five seconds to press X to dodge a text-book being swung at you, while Ridiculous may give you the same amount of time to press X, F, Q, and the right mouse button. It's fairly good reflex training that will, if nothing else, help you remember where a few keys are on your keyboard. There's even a 1994 mode that reduces the video quality to match that of year-appropriate camcorders.\n\nFinally, we come to the production quality. Here's where I'm a little mixed on Press X to Not Die. As a player, I enjoy the B-movie feel of it all, even if it means it feels like they shot a majority of the game in, perhaps, a day. As someone who's worked on films before, though, I know that even though it feels campy and cobbled together, there's a lot of effort that was put it. There's scenes in private property such as an office/lab building and parking garage that required either a shooting permit or a great deal of trust and permission, there's a fair amount of make-up and wardrobe assisting the art direction, and the editing, while far from seamless, certainly required thought and a LOT of pre-planning (which, unfortunately, is one thing that nobody outside of All Seeing Eye will ever know the amount of) to go through what was likely hundreds upon hundreds of takes.\n\nMy one gripe with the production aspect would be the sound work. While the audio itself was clear and free of any major issues, my inner "sound guy" was displeased with the scene in the girlfriend's house where the main character tells her how many times he died getting there and whether or not her roommate killed him. The strange "Oh, it's you." as she first notices your presence feels very... out of place. Almost like it was done in ADR afterwards and placed in later because she was out of range of the microphone. The aforementioned meta list, however, plays out fine until it hits a very audible hitch in the form of "And then your roommate almost killed me!" For clarification, it sounds like "And then, your roommate - ALMOST - killedme." in three different inflections that show a bit TOO much of the combinations occurring behind the scenes. A small nitpick, but it's there.\n\nBottom line, though, Press X to Not Die is a fun way to kill an hour or two for the price of coffee at whatever trendy place you go to. Forgive it for stumbling like a newborn giraffe at some points, and you'll find a pleasant, satirical romp through a world suddenly filled with quick-time events.","November 27, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't expect much when I bought it but it turned out to be really entertaining.\nBasically, the game mechanics consist of multiple-choice dialogues and quick-time events only that determine which FMV sequence is played next -just like in some of the good old FMV games back in the 90s- but the story and the acting are just too much fun to be bothered by little things like that.\nThere are online leaderboards, a low-res mode to enforce the aforementioned retro vibe and achievements are placed exactly in the right spots, too. The game doesn't take itself seriously, which dramatically increases its charm. Maybe that's why I like it so much... Footage has been captured with a GoPro Hero 3+ Black Edition btw, just in case you're wondering. The only downer is that the game's so short, however there is some replay value, at least if you're willing to play through all possible choices to see all available FMVs. Considering the game still to be in Early Access phase, there's a chance that the devs will add more content, which I'd personally appreciate very much, but even if they don't this game is definitely worth your time.\nAll talk aside, I enjoyed Press X To Not Die a lot and I'm really looking forward to part 2 :)","December 6, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Liked it very much. Finished it 2 times (about 30 minutes for one playthrough and 50%) .

"heh ?" "what ?".... it got on my nerves at some sections where it really was repetitive.\n\n2) Since the game entirely is a QTE made with IRL movie (which is awesome btw), the transitions between each QTE move is a bit brutal sometimes.\n\nBut these are insignificant, the game is a 8/10 for me.","May 30","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
