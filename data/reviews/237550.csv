RoA still has a couple of UI glitches, and isn't always pretty to look at. The English voice acting is atrocious.\n\nHowever, the game-stopping bugs present at launch have been fixed. The visuals are adequate; not great, but not terrible. The voice acting, luckily, can be disabled.\n\nAs for gameplay, RoA is almost more of a management sim than a typical RPG. I actually appreciate that. The preparation you have to put into traveling during the winter months is possibly more important than how well-equipped your party is for combat. You just don't see certain kinds of brutal gameplay concepts (exposure, thirst & starvation, exhaustion, sickness & disease) in these kinds of games anymore. Unless you play smart, your adventure can easily end during the first winter, with your frostbitten party starving to death on a mountain trail.\n\nHow many fantasy RPGs have you played lately in which a winter coat is more important to your survival than a +3 sword?\n\nNow, I didn't buy RoA at release. In fact, I didn't begin playing it until after the final major patch was out. So I didn't experience how badly broken it was at release. My only experience of RoA is with the game in its current state.\n\nSo, how is it currently? As far as I can tell, RoA is feature-complete compared to the original Realms of Arkania game from the '90s. Every quest present and working in the original is present and working in this remake. In fact, the devs have added new bits of content to the game (quests, encounters, etc), so the game now has MORE content than the original.\n\nAgain, RoA isn't the prettiest game to look at. But the gameplay itself is just what I was looking for when I bought it - unforgiving, difficult, oldschool, and based in the Dark Eye universe.\n\nAt over 100 hours ingame, and having finished the main questline and nearly all side quests, I can honestly say that I got my money's worth out of Realms of Arkania. Your mileage may vary, however, depending on how tolerant you are of outdated graphics, general lack of polish, and brutally unforgiving gameplay straight out of 1992.","January 19, 2015","true","133.5"," 80 of 90 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","80","90","0","1"

People who don't know the original ROA should read about it somewhere. I'm just gonna say this: its a WRPG where you have to THINK. Its a REAL RPG, where your skills are as much important inside battles AND outside.\n\nI'm here to talk about this reboot only, assuming everyone here knows ROA.\n\nFirst of all, this game was released in a very incomplete state when it came to STEAM. Almost unplayable, actually. The guys patched it intensivelly after that, but at that point, the game got some of the worst reviews ever (as bad as Big Rigs!!). The thing is: after all the patching, the game became QUITE playable... and very fun to play. But people didn't gave it a chance.\n\nJust like the original ROA, your party has TONS of skills that are used in battles and on the field. This is what I always liked about ROA, and its all here. Just like in the original ROA, you have to take real good care of your chars. They will get sick if you are in a cold place without clothes for winter, for example. And just like in the original ROA, this is the most fun part of this game: surviving while exploring the world.\n\nThe battles in here are the weakest part though. Then again, they were not much different in the original ROA... Keep in mind that this game is NOT forgiving in the beginning. You will die. A LOT. You will miss most attacks, you will be frustrated. It was like this in ROA, and its exactly the same in ROA HD. After a while, you'll get better, and will be able to DESTROY your enemies. This version has some bad looking character models though. It seems they are just placeholders, but never replaced with real models. Your characters look awful, your enemies look awful too... The backgrounds are ok. The originals had horrible looking battle backgrounds, and they are also bad here. But are at least more detailed, and since they are in 3D, you can rotate the camera at will.\n\nOutside battles the game look quite good; impressive for a low budget game, actually. Even though this is an indie game, the backgrounds are VERY detailed, and beautiful to look at. Specially the dungeons: they are very good looking, and varied. And since the game is in 3D, you won't move in a grid based system, like in ROA 1 and 2. You can move freely, rotate the camera at will, look up and down. Kinda like ROA3, but with a WAY more beautiful world.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is still a VERY rough release. It has some bugs and some bad looking models. But its FUN. One of the most fun RPGs I've ever played. You need patience though. This isn't a game for newbie's. If you didn't like the original ROA, you will NOT like this one. ROA HD is just ROA, but with 3D graphics.\n\nEven if this game has issues, I recommend it for fans of the original ROA. Give this game a chance. Exploring the game world is fun now. You won't see that basic tile-based cities that all look the same anymore. You'll see a world in 3D, with detailed residences, rivers and real people walking around (the 3 ROA games didn't even had NPCs visible in the game world!!). You will learn to care for that characters, because if you don't they WILL die on you. And you will be able to do optional quests to get money and experience, or can just run around the world aimlesly for as much as you want (if you can survive, that is).\n\n\nThis is a great game. With more polish, it would be perfect. It's fun the way it is though, and this is what's most important in a game.","March 29, 2015","true","17.8"," 64 of 74 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","64","74","0","2"

(Delaying the Ork Invasion is 1.32 review)\n\n*****Delaying the Ork Invasion*****\n\nWhy I chose this title? Because at the release of this game, we all were leaning towards the thoughts that the game was doomed and orks would conquer the Northlands without our intervention. The game was a mess of bugs and a graphical parody to a degree where NPCs and surroundings would make you feel like in a zombie apocalypse version of Northlands. And furthermore the game used to lack many spells, mechanics and had several other gamebreakers which is probably the reason turned off many people. But...there is always a "but"...and this time it is a good "but".\n\nThe game evolved...while I am telling you its evolved it is in the level of a pokemon evolution where you would barely recognize what it was before. Crafty Studios perhaps hired a faery who touched the game with her magical wand exorcising a nasty demon who made the game look bad and broken. Or briefly, they worked their asses off during these months releasing several patches to reach this state. But before going into detail...some screenshots from my game:\n\nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/1zsvh03w/c4dcb1c8/\n\nIf you have the game, you will notice the major differences...if you don't have the game well you should get it while it is still on Christmas Sales, because the great leap forward which has started with 1.32 patch which is named as "Revised" will not stop till "Gold" version of the game. I presume you already looked at the screenshots. Here I will not go over change by change but mention the crucial changes which made me rather happy.\n\nThe Journey Map is in English and place names are in accordance with the original Blade of Destiny. Of course still there are no descriptions for Hjaldor Mountains and such, that is just a matter of adding a few place holders.\n\nNPCs look good and NPCs with striped pants you can feel like you are really traversing Thorwalian towns. Also market days, opening/closing times of the shops as well as if you get caught cheating at a tavern you get punished by no entrance features integrated to the game over this time.\n\nThe new UI which provides more information to the people in a coherent way, as well as they are more versatile then the old UI which was closing a part of the main screen. Now you have a broader area of view where you can enjoy the good sights of the game.\n\nExcept Demon Summoning spells(which are not added) and a few more, most of the spells are fully functioning and ready to assist you in a dungeon as utility or perhaps to decimate your foes as fast as possible. After all, we could wait a little while longer to see a few stray/unimplemented spells.\n\nI'm not even mentioning several optical improvements done to the environment letting screenshots talk for themselves. Though, one thing worth mentioning is the improved interiors of the buildings...especially my favourite is the inn which gave me a dark feeling and I could say I was definitely in backwater, gloomy Northlands of Aventuria.\n\nThere are also a good deal of fine tunings, bugfixes and balancings...but I'll cut to the chase. This game evolved truly and deserves a second chance. You will not regret it, especially when you buy it now at a bargain price.\n\nEdit: Price advice was during Christmas Sale, but rest of the review is still valid since it features 1.32 patch. I will update the review, after every noticeable change.\n\n*****To Cross the Borders*****\n\nThe anticipated 1.33 patch hit the Steam and I should say while there are still shortcomings here and there, it has been a solid improvement.\n\nThough sadly we still have to be exposed to unpolished Battle Avatars and Sounds. This can be a major deterrent to some players. But for me it is a moment of "Eh..." since I have been more interested in content of the battles rather then nice looks. But I must point out, now spells are associated with different animations, that can be a good indication for the future polishing(One can keep hoping).\n\nNow, one major striking point is that every temple has a different interior as well as the temple distribution on Hjaldings is accurate to the world description. So you'll find a good deal of Swafnir and Travia temples while there are no Praios or Boron temples.\n\nAbout battle, there are now Battle Stances! Yes, they have finally found their way into the game. Aggressive, Balanced and Defensive. Depending on your tactical situation, now you can make use of those stances. For example, if you flanked somebody, this especially alleviates the issue where hitting is a problem. Going aggressive will increase your hit chance while reducing your parry chance, providing you more success. On the other hand, a hard pressed character can switch to defensive to hold off the enemy. Another plus is that now Necrophobia is important in battles. It'll make your characters skip a turn if undead is in the vicinity. (Necrophobia roll) Also weapon/monster re-balancing seems like it will make things quite different then before. One example is some animals are hitting twice. Also two spells Nekropathia and Abvenenum added to the game. The more, the merrier.\n\nHeavy bugfixing as usual made the game stabler and Main Game+DLCs present a good deal of content. "For the Gods" add a number of challenging unique battles across 2 detailed dungeons and one town while "Ogredeath" adds several side quests spread through the world and one extra dungeon at Groenvelden.\n\nNow, I should stress it again. If Battle Characters, Animations and Sounds can get an overhaul via a major patch, this game has the potential to be a true success. The game has already crossed the border of remake and now it should move forward with full force.\n\n*****More Then A Remake*****\n\nI wasn't expecting to update my review but surprisingly 1.34 patch hit Steam containing several additional encounters, bugfixes and fine-tunings to mechanics. Additionally some of the good mods (such as herb pouch) created by the dedicated community members of the game made formal appearance with this patch. The game still has the mediocre character models, but aside that in my eyes it has become more then a remake already.","December 23, 2013","true","53.4"," 116 of 155 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","116","155","0","1"

What I fiend for in games are interesting combat systems and diverse skills. So far, this title doesn't disappoint.\n\nI feel that watching my fledgling characters grow as the adventure progresses will be quite gratifying in this title. I can't wait to get into some serious questing.\n\nOne thing I still can't stand in this  game is the English language voice acting.  They need some serious help in the voiceover depatment. Monotonous doesn't even begin to describe the voice work, though it may be an ESL issue.\n\nRegardless, this is a small quibble about a product that has been considerably improved over the last few weeks.

Yes, I’m leaving out Blade of Destiny. Though I played it for quite some time, I never could get really into it. It wasn’t the complex gameplay that turned me off, it was navigating the cities which frustrated me the most. Nearly every building looked the same, be it taverns or homes of important NPCs. I spent a lot of my time running into every building just to see if there was some hint left to be discovered,…which in 99% of every visit wasn’t the case.  So after quite some time I lost interest but tried to get back into the game several times.\n\nBefore you judge me, I was 10 years old back then, so maybe my attention span was shorter than today. If you ask me, “Startrail” did everything better. When I learned about the remake of “Blade of Destiny” I was quite enthusiastic. When it was finally released, the reviews were so devastating, it was hard to believe. I read many reviews, watched many videos, and I was shocked. Everything looked so unfinished. Then I learned about the many patches and finally bought the game after the release of the “revised” patch. I started it up and it looked…okay. Yes, that’s not high praise. I checked the forums and realized that the developers were still very involved in fixing the game with the help of the very active community. I decided to wait a little longer, and with the arrival of version 1.35 I finally decided to play the game. That was three days ago. Three days of which I spent 27 hours playing “Blade of Destiny HD” and simply put: I had a blast!\nOf course there are many things one could criticize: The story is kind of generic (and obviously always was), the graphics are not great, the combat is clunky and the cities seem a little lifeless. Were this a completely “new” game these things would mean a lot more to me, but as a remake I think this is finally a great product. It made me feel like I felt back then, but without the constant complaining about the city navigation. And I still love the original soundtrack from the 90s version, which is included in the remake.\n\nSo, should YOU play “Blade of Destiny HD”? If you liked the original, there’s not much left that should stop you from playing this game. If you want your RPGs to be a little more accessible and modern, you should probably stay clear. But if you were remotely into complex RPGs back in the 90s or enjoy pen & paper RPGs, give it a shot. You won't regret it!\n","July 30, 2015","true","27.7"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","30","33","0","0"

There are too many problems with the game and things such as difficult controls and poor user interface will frustrate anyone who doesn't have the nostalgia of the original to force them to overlook the problems.\n\nThe user interface and controls are shockingly bad. The developers really need to fix it but I can't see that happening. Other games in this genre such as the elder scrolls have very easy controls. The game also has bugs such as the wrong text on dialogs and random bugs that get you stuck in a situation where nothing is happening. The most frustrating for me was that you can't cancel the level up process and start again.\n\nThe game is very true to the original however and I think they succeeded improving on the original in quite a few ways.

I am leaving the initial impressions up because I believe it's important to note that the game was intentionally released and sold as a finished product, and not marked as Early Access, when it was in actuality in horribly unfinished and unplayable condition.\n\nI believe this speaks to the character of both the developer and the publisher and is worth noting.\n\n-----\n\nRun. Run far away. Now.\n\nI hesitate to even write this because it's categorized as a recommendation and this is the farthest thing from that. (*edit: Valve changed this as of 11/25/13 recommendations are now "reviews" and you can thumbs up or down)\n\nIn all my years of gaming and all the games I've played I can say that this is the absolute worst launch of a game I've ever experienced. An abysmal festering trainwreck that grants more entertainment value from reading angry posts in the forum than it does from the actual game.\n\nIt looks like crap, plays like ♥♥♥ and has more bugs than a Louisiana swamp. To call it a beta would be dishonest, that it's being sold as a finished product is really fraud. I'd say pre-alpha is the most accurate way to describe the state of this game.\n\nIf all of that doesn't scare you off then please at very least go browse the community forums first before you go to buy this game and see what the general consensus is about the state of the game by owners. I won't even say players because hardly anyone can even play it for any significant length of time.\n\nThey are issuing patches literally on a daily basis currently but it still has a long way to go and I don't have the most faith in these developers to ultimately end up with a good product at some point down the road.\n\nThis game is a textbook example of why none of us should be pre-ordering or buying released games without first checking to see what the general community consensus is. It's extremely obvious that no one at Valve even booted up the game to play for 10 seconds and the developers admit it was released unfinished. Yet here it still sits in the store being sold as a finished product.\n\nThe old Roman concept of Caveat Emptor holds very true here.","August 4, 2013","false","1.8"," 97 of 147 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","97","147","0","20"

If you are a fan of oldschool RPGs with lots of flavor text, skills, quests, items, spells, and plot buy that when it comes out.\n\nAs it is though, it was released a few months ago as completed when it actually appeared to be an early access alpha, couldnt even be called beta.\n\nI bought it on release, and it was so buggy I literally couldnt get past the character creation screen, or even into it for that matter. Had the devs released it as early access they would have had a horde of loyal followers. But what they released as a complete game looked worse than some small game-builds Ive seen people make for quarter-long class projects. This, obviously, torked off a lot of people, myself included.\n\nThe translation leaves a bit to be desired as well. For instance when you light a torch/lantern, the game asks you "What do you want to inflame?" For those of you that are not native English speakers, inflame has two meanings, neither of which has to do with lighting an actual fire. The most common use means "To cause strong emotions in, esp anger or lust." The other means "an infected or red and swollen wound/part of the body injured due to sickness or damage.". Needless to say the sentence cracks me up every time I try to set something on fire. As in "What would you like to make really lustful?" or "What wounds would you like to infect?"\n\nSo why am I recommending it? In short, when it works right, its *awesome*.\n\nThat and the head dev is very active on the forums, has apologized for the game repeatedly, and has made great strides in making it functional. You can play it now. There are still bugs, but they are relatively minor although annoying.\n\nIt has ok graphics, that are slowly getting better, and a decent automap. I tried to play the original from the 90s while waiting for this one to be playable. It didnt have an automap. I dont have the time to map anymore, like I did as a teenager, so thats a great improvement. The music is perfect for the setting, and really puts you in the appropriate mood. Town music is cheerful, and puts you in the mind of wandering through a small green village with exposed-woood and thatch roofs. Dungeon music is nicely dark and spooky, with weird ambient effects. Only really bad thing about non-combat sound is the ♥♥♥♥ing *awful* narrarator. He narrates *everything*. And its *terrible*. Fortunately, it can be turned off. The sound effects in battle are typical grunts, "Oof"s, "EEeee"s, slashes, spell zaps and so on. Nothing special.\n\nThe combat is action-point turn based (Fallout 1/2 style), but there is decent room for strategy with the large selection of spells, movement, combat options and so forth.\n\nAs far as content, theres a lot. You can camp, hunt, look for herbs, set watches and get attacked. In town you can talk to shopkeepers, drink, gamble, pick pocets (Although you can do nothing with the wandering NPCs - I think they are just there for flavor)Random events and side quests abound, and really make the setting come alive. I cant wait for it to be finished and fullly functional, with all content added (There are still some missing side quests).\n\nSo I future-recommend it for any oldschool RPG fan, with the caveat "Even though its not listed as Early Access, it is. Don't get it now, wait for the completed gold edition. If you don't, there will be bugs. *Most*are not game breaking *knocks on wood*, but they are there.\n\nI also have to recommend it just because of how open and honest the devs have been, unlike so many who drop broken as hell games on Steam and then disappear while laughing all the way to the bank.","November 25, 2013","true","26.0"," 66 of 106 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","66","106","0","1"

This is a modern version of the original and if any of you have played that than you know how brutal this can be. Disease, hunger, dehydration all can kill you as well as enemies.\n\nGraphics split into two sections\nWorld  Beautiful for the most part and then just average in some areas (npc's especially females)\nCombat\nIts full motion turn based combat and a different engine was used (appearently) and it is ugly. They dropped the ball imo here as this is what many players complain about. The mechanics work well, but the rendered models are less than stellar. If only they had really had more time on this it could have been awesome but I guess animation full motion is probably extremely complicated. Also weapons are not diplayed correctly, for example a character with a sling is shown using a crossbow. Beleive me they took a hit on yhat one with modern gamers.\n\nMusic\nTop of the line...seriuosly up there with Jeremy Soule and Two Steps from Hell\nCombat and other sounds\nGood to just o.k.\nInteraction with world\nLike in the original 99% of the NPC's serve no purpose. So whem you enter a city you'll see people in the streets etc. that you cannot talk to. Merchants and tavern keepers  say the same old things over and over. You'll find your selves quickly pushing dialouge(sp) buttons as quickly as you can.\n\nProgression of characters\nSlow and grindy. However this game is about living in a fantasy world and at level 1 all your characters are really weak (as it should be) and will fail much more often than they succeed. EVENTUALLY your heroes will start to improve but you are going to spen ALOT of time in combat. Did I mention progression is slow?\n\nOther stuff:\nAlthough you have healing magic, it is not gonna be enough to restore everyone to pristine condition so you are going to have to find Inns to rest in. Now you can campout overnight and heal BUT wounds can get infected. As I said this a simulation fantasy experience and it ain't gonna hold your hand. There are various diseases that can set in but they are all treatable with herbs you can search for (good ones very rare as expected) or buy. Herbs and potions are VERY VERY VERY expensive. Magic items are extremely rare but you can buy some enchanted weapons in some rare places but after seeing the prices you will probably decide "Nah I will loot some magic off foes". This is simply a pipe dream it is so rare.\n\nThere are smiths\nBecause your weapons get worn and can break (you better have a backup weapon for combat)\nThe stores, smiths, herb shops, healers, Inns etc. all have varied equipment and different prices. There is definetly some economy management to your party. You will find yourselves going from shop to shop looking for the best prices because as I may have mentioned, things are very expensive. If you are lazy and just buy from the first store that has the item you are looking for, then you may later learn you spent twice the amount of extremely important gold that could have been used elsewhere.\n\nthere is also a weak haggling system. You can try for up to a 50% dicount but be warned if you anger the shop keepers they may kick you out and refuse to deal with you until you leave town for awhile.\n\nWorld size and quest\nThe world is vast but quest are limited. You will spend all your time on the main quest as it sends you all over the place. There are side missions too and I would reccomend doing them, but it wont be long and you will be on the main quest again. No spoilers here so that is all I will say regarding quest.\n\nIs it linear?  Nope, you can go wherever you want, and do side quest in any order for the most part.\n\nBug?\nYep. got some. Most are minor like the wrong label on items are events that don't really seem to do anyrthing. I personaly have not come upon any game-breakers though.\n\nSo who will like this game?\nOlder D&D players who appreciate using your imgination and really want the "feel" of a true wolrd. Grognards who keep diligent notes and love a challenge. Hardcore gamers.\n\nWho will not like this game?\nConsole gamers that push "a" and everything dies type gamers. Gamers that like being spoon fed. Tales of MaJael (which I also own and love) and rouge-like gamers. Probably. Its kinda the opposite of those type games. Rush players who want to quickly become powerful and complete the game.\n\nOverall\nI simply love this game. It can be tedious at times but I find myself losing hours in this world. Don't let played hours fool you as I play offline alot because my bandwidth is also split between my two sons watching movies and playing online console/computer games.\n\nIf you are a hardcore simulation type that can get past a few hiccups and use your imagination I whole-heartedly reccomend this experience. Fast players give this a pass/\n\nFinal note...The devs had some legal issues and had to stop development and updates for awhile but are now back currently working on a patch anb free DLC (Ithink) and most importantly making the game open to modders.","May 4, 2015","true","75.7"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","1"

There's plenty to explore and learn about the Dark Eye's roleplaying system which they appear to have transplanted into the game as directly as they could manage down to very specific details.

Pick your team of champions and explore town to stock up on essentials before heading out for some serious dungeon-crawling. Are you sick of the ease with which you typically overcome early adversaries in other games? Well buckle-up, because getting through your very first battles on the higher difficulty settings will take a bit of swag, even for the most seasoned oldschool rpg vet. Deal with feeding, watering and keeping your party warm and healthy in ways that bring a whole new level of realism to roleplaying, presenting you with challenges even long before you arrive at your destination.

I tried to like this game. I really did. Having played the original back in the 90s on a C-64 I expected to have something comparable to that. Perhaps it's being seen through rose colored glasses, perhaps not.\n\nWhat we ended up with here is a shadow of the game's former self. The cities are generic, the buildings all look the same, the NPCs (if you could call the that) have no life to them. Inns, taverns, shops, smithies, you can't tell one from the other at all except for the names.\n\nThe voice acting should have been left out entirely. It's awful. It's obvious as hell that whoever was doing it isn't a native English speaker and was dry reading from a script. Yes, it's almost 2014, but not every game is well suited to lots of voice acted stuff. This one certainly isn't.\n\nThe combat system is a major deal breaker though. I know I can't possibly be doing things SO WRONG that I screwed up two different attempts to roll up and equip a party. Every fight I've been in (which has always been the party's first) ends in defeat with us missing, fumbling, being parried, or whatever. Rarely hit a damn thing even with high stats and all the equipment our meager funding could manage. Turning things over to the auto-AI is an extremely disappointing and very LONG wait for the same result - our deaths.\n\nI hate to say it, but this is starting to become a trend with these Indie RPGs and it's now going to make me think long and hard about parting with the money I'm spending on this stuff.

I shudder to think of what playing the original re-release of BoD must have been like.\n\nPros:\n-Planning your party's make-up and levelling up strategy matters (somewhat)\n-A somewhat nostalgic old-school RPG flavor with emphasis on being true to the underlying game world, and story-telling/quests\n-Apparently there is a second installment in the RoA series being worked on, so hopefully the party you build and grow in BoD can carry over to the Star Trail re-make (assuming the developers improve on playability in the next installment)\n\nCons:\n-Combat is glacially slow, riddled with incessant misses, and overall just a chore.  If my characters weren't missing all the time, they would be dropping their weapons, or the weapons would break.  (Hi I'm a warrior, trained in all kinds of combat techniques and... Whoopsie I just dropped my sword on the ground and now I'm dead....) Luckily I ran across a forum post recommending to switch to computer-controlled combat.  I did that, running at a 100x time multiplier and basically just brute-forced combat encounters until I won.  (You can configure the time speed-up to use in the settings for the game.)\n-A still largely opaque and broken skill system.

For the life of me I still don't understand why my characters miss combat hits, mis-cast spells, etc... The game sorely needs a way in-game to explain what success/failure percentages are, and how changes in base skills and talents will effect those percentages.\n-Related to disease, it seems that staring at the sky (metaphorically speaking) in this game leads to your character contracting a disease.  While I did choose to play the game with the realism setting turned on, the way disease works in this game is beyond ridiculous.  I swear in at least one case a party member went from "ouch I didn't sleep well because of a pebble" to "I'm dead" in a matter of days because of the inane disease mechanic in the game.\n-As noted earlier, weapons break in combat.  As in ...all... ...the... ...time...  I never did figure out how to prevent this from happening.  You can buy whetstones in shops, and repair weapons after each combat occurrence which helps to some extent.  But unless you are lucky enough to find a magical weapon, resign yourself to weapons constantly breaking in combat and your party being reduced to making like Chuck Norris (unarmed combat: go punch mummies in the face!)\n-Travel becomes laborious after a while.  At first I enjoyed travelling around parts of the map, wondering what I would run into.  But once I got farther into the game, and the much larger distances that needed to be traversed, travel was an exercise in boredom and frustration.  Travel is also a great opportunity to contract disease - despite running around with cloaks, sleeping bags, campfires, etc...  I swear there is a bug somewhere in this game that is just hell-bent on making characters contract disease.\n-Inventory management is, well,  unmanageable, because of the strict encumbrance system.  Luckily I could use a number of mods (listed below) to make inventory management tolerable.\n\n*Review based on playing Blade of Destiny v1.36 with all three DLCs installed.  It is important to play with at least the latest free DLC (With Blade and Brilliance) since it includes numerous bugfixes.\n\n*Additionally I installed a number of mods to make levelling and inventory substantially less onerous:  Packesel (pack horse), Mit Sack und Pack (storage chests for potions, books, jewellry and poisons), and erfolgreicheSteigerung (replaces random level up rolls with fixed increases and 100% skill up success).  Very important:  don't put any of the storage add-ins inside of another storage add-in.  For example if you drag and drop your pack-horse, onto the pack-horse by mistake - all of the inventory stored by the pack-horse disappears!\n\n*Mods can be downloaded from a mod database[forum.schicksalsklinge.com].  Hint:  use Chrome for its handy translate feature if you don't speak German!\n\n*Highly recommended to read both of the following community guides for this game so you can plan a reasonable party and know how to invest in and focus on growing your party's skills:\n\n"The old Memories Blade of Destiny Starter Guide"   and    "A camping Guide through Arkania"","April 24","false","65.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","8"

Even thought one can indeed feel that 'some' effort has been put into the game, the outcome is just a pale shadow of the original.\n\nTruth be told, the original Blade of Destiny from 1993 had lousy graphics and even the MIDI music was very rudimentary; but everything else was excellent: the story, the user interface, the 'randomness factor' - you name it, you have it. You wish to have fights automaticaly calculated - no problem. You wish to speed things up or slow down a bit? No problem. User inventory and skills? Very simple and comprehensive. I can recommend this game heartily to any fan of a good story!\n\nAnd the HD version of the same? Its a complete opposite. Graphics are better (which is not hard, considering the first version to be almost 23 years old) and the music is remastered, story is the same... But the user interface is messed up. Controls are very unintuitive, inventory as well, movement through cities and dungeons is very sluggish and tiresome, as is any other aspect of the game - starting with character generation. If you end up entering someone's house - you need to wait for the narrator to finish his line before being able to somehow get out of there. ESC doesnt work, there is no cancel key, nothing. Only the right mouse button, only after the narrator finished reading the same boring line. That is absolutely unacceptable for anyone who plays RPGs and explores every door that can be opened.\nAnd then... the battles. They cannot be accelerated, nor speed-automated as in the original version. If your high level party gets attacked by a couple of rats, you still have to wait 15 min for the battle to be decided. Ridiculous.\n\nThe *only* improvement that I have seen in the HD version over the 1993 version is the comprehensive explanation of skills and required traits for them. And I did not know that a crystal ball can be enchanted like wands. ^_^\n\nIts a shame really... I love the realms of arkania trilogy; it is one of my favorite games of all times, but the HD version is unplayable :(\n\nTo make things even worse, the support forum is bugged. Registration at forum.schicksalsklinge.com is neigh impossible, nor is possible contact support (always the 'wrong captcha').\n\nA shame indeed.","January 30","false","28.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Not only do you have to manually tinker with game files to even start the game in English, one must also (re)select your desired resolution and the option to not run in windowed mode everytime you start the game up. If you want to change settings in-game, then you will crash. This is one of many crashes you will experience. How about starting a new game? After selecting new game and then your difficulty, you will crash again. I will not list all of the crashes, because I don't want to ruin this awesome simulator for you guys.\n\nGraphics - 10/10:\nSeriously the menu looks amazing. So does my desktop after an error-less crash.\n\nGameplay - 10/10:\nAll crashes are instant and uncorrectable due to the lack of a way of diagnosing the crashes. This makes it much different from other games, where instead of Googling how to fix the crash, you first have to figure out how it happened in the first place. Nice to see a simulator with a puzzle element to it.\n\nSound - 9/10:\nThe sound is the only lacking feature, and it's amazing. The sound you get when you crash is so good, you won't even believe that you heard it.\n\nOverall - 10/10:\nThis is seriously the best crash simulator I've ever played.","April 25","false","0.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","58","7","12","13","0"

First it doesnt like avast at all had to change a .exe program just to get it to run. You can not move around inside buildings. Its just a static shot of a tavern owner and a few others. The graphics look fine. However the main issue I have with this game is it doesnt hold your hand its slaps it and starts to feel mean spirited. I would think this being the year 2014 that once you have taken a quest your given a marker on your map. You know to find out where to go. Well that was my mistake I suppose I get 2 quest. One about an orge army and I leave the place thinking I am going to get some directions or least some directions as to where to go. Nope. Also leaving a building you think it would the movement key. Nope its a right click and boots. Ugh.\n\nThis might have been a hoot in the 90's but now it looks old and sad. Compared to skyrim, morrowind and a ton of others that have done this.

Turn based combat was a limitation of old processors so keeping it in this revision brought the limitations of old games into modern gaming.  Additionally, the combat graphics and sky graphics are really bad and look like something you would have seen back in 2002.  I also recommend turning off the voice volume since the narration can get annoying quickly.\n\nIt does have a few good qualities.  The story and music are excellent.  The map travel and random encounters are well implemented.  You can also start the game over with an advanced party and keep your experience and gear - I did this since the game is very unforgiving to level 1 characters.  The fighters couldn't hit anything, the mages' spells kept failing, and the thief couldn't pick any locks which made the beginning of the game very frustrating.  After slugging it to level 2, I started over with the same group and the game is much more playable so far.","March 1, 2014","true","13.5"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

I see no redeeming value in this at all.  I tried...  I really did.  If you want to play this game.  Nab yourself a copy of the ACTUAL Realms of Arkania!  I believe the trilogy is on GOG for dirt cheap.  This remake is garbage!  Its clearly not a finished product.  Even basic things like character creation are buggy and incomplete.  This is obviously not a "finished" product.  I'd say it was an alpha at best likely shoved out the door when the money ran out.  A good indicator of the quality to expect... look at the steam achievements.  It lists it as having 1 achievement.  Now take a closer look at that achievement.  Its a random glitchy screenshot of turn based combat labeled "Testing Achievement".  When you try to view this achievement it gives you an error.  Obviously the developer threw that together quickly to test how achievements work and dispaly... and never got rid of it.  Good show.  Now just think to yourself... if they butchered their store page display that bad... what is the game going to be like!?  Incase you really love to torture yourself and decide to buy this game anyway... have fun trying to understand a damn thing.  All the dialogue, writing, and descriptions read as if they were translated into english by "Borat from Khazakstan", that is of course whenever the text is even in a place thats readable or there at all. Almost all of the entries in the help section in the game had a majority of the text running out of the help window itself.  Very helpful.  Creating a character was a tumor inducing affair as well... I've played enough RPG's to guess what a Warrior, Hunter, or Rogue is like skill and ability wise. But you aren't even going to give me a hint about classes like dwarf, thalworian woman, leaf elf, ice elf, etc?  Not to mention there is no information about what any of the attiributes do in-game.  If somehow you haven't already quit and uninstalled ... you'll get into the game itself and can leave the temple you start in.  Now you're in a 3D city with not a damn clue what you should be doing.  Even on the lowest settings moving around the city ran horrible and using shift to run causes nausea inducing motion blur effects.  Through some heroic act of endurance against this horror of a game I managed to play long enough to get into a battle.  It was a buggy and unpleasant affair.  I played several turns of combat and then quit to uninstall.  Do not buy this game.  Its not even a game its a scam to play on peoples nostalgia.  I used to love the original of this game... I know my memory isn't quite what it used to be but I know the game wasn't anything close to this abortion of code.  Honestly I've never asked for a refund on a Steam purchase before not even on games that don't run... but this one.  I think I'm asking for a refund for.","August 5, 2013","false","1.4"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","1"

It is far from polished in its current state - there are still a lot of glitches and bugs, mind you. But after the initial disappointment of the original release, I began enjoying going back to the game every few patches to see what had changed and loved seeing how they got more and more things right.\n\nRight now it works well enough for me to actually beat the campaign, which was a pleasant christmas suprise. Bugs and glitches aside, at its core Blade of Destiny is a very atmospheric and captivating game - always was, always will be. Hunting for the missing pieces of a treasure map to discover a long lost sword that will shape the fate of the aventurian version of Scandinavia - it is a seemingly simple task, but one does not simply walk into the Orklands and grabs the Blade of Destiny from Hyggelik's barrow.\n\nCompared to other roleplaying games, the Dark Eye titles make heavy use of an overwhelming set of skills and magicks. Figuring out what is actually useful is a "quest" of its own but a necessary one to complete. You will have to brave many dangers and nasty monsters are not exactly your biggest problem. On your travels partymembers will catch diseases, some might even die if you are not skilled in alchemy or healing magick. So, you actually train less to best monsters in combat, but to survive the harsh conditions of the Northlands itself  -  the survival-aspect of "Blade of Destiny" always was quite unique in both concept and execution as it forces you to manage equipment and resources besides grabbing as much "big pointy stick +1" and mithril-chainmail. Running out of supplies in the middle of winter in a remote mountain region can spell doom for your entire party and Aventuria doesn't care if the heroes are clad in shiny battle-armour. Forgot to bring some fur-coats? Tough luck - you will freeze to death. There is a gritty realism at work here, that can be annoying if not downright frustrating at times - but it really helps in delivering that pen & paper-feeling and adds an extra-bit of depth to the world that a lot of the great classics of CRPG are missing.\n\nThankfully the remake has a beginner-mode, a welcomed addition in my book. "Survival" can add a bit of drag, especially when travelling long distances over land - so if you care less about that aspect of the game and are in it for story and atmosphere, the developers have got you covered.\n\nA lot of what goes on in "Blade of Destiny" might seem very weird and very specific but it is this level of detail, complexity and the resulting learning curve that sets the entire series apart from other, simpler CRPGs. However, this remake finally allows easy access to this deep roleplaying-experience, making it a lot less clunky and much more comfortable to play thanks to a much better UI. This alone is reason enough for me to kind of recommend it.\n\nI am writing kind of, because it will probably take another couple of months before the most obvious problems are fixed (the combat AI is just randomly bugging out at times, sometimes the game doesn't properly register if you are in or out of battle (preventing you to save!)) and a whole bunch of other oddities that usually disappear on a reload. Other stuff like broken achievements and reported crashing issues might take a bit more time. If they can get those things fixed, the Blade of Destiny remake will become a good game in it's own right, worth having if you are into classic computer-roleplaying. Until then, you might want to wait a little longer or grab it for a low-low price in a sale.","December 27, 2013","true","18.0"," 17 of 39 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","17","39","0","0"

When in dialog with an NPC all of the NPC's have the same arm movements. I found this a little distracting. It was really distracting with a few of NPC's where the lay of the clothing, the logic of the arm movement, and the arm all created a sort of hellicoptor effect.\n2. The fixed camera angle works most of the time but when going up or down an incline this presents a problem.\n3. The inabillity to move items from one party member to another easily made game play a downer. Be careful how much and what objects you give to party members.\n\nGood stuff:\nThe narration voice was good. Not harsh, not rushed, and very practiced. It is a voice with a even pitch and tone.\nThe random party I was presented at the beginning of the game was well rounded.\nThe idea of the beginner quest in the local school dungons was good. It may be that I just never found that one when I played the old version.\n\nOverall:\nThis version was just as engaging for me as the original.

You remember that one dufus kind in middle school who never read his book, bought the cliff notes and never read those, then when the teacher called on him to do his report, he stalled and stalled until finally he got up there and mumbled incoherent garbage until the bell rang, then looked up victorious as smirked "Well I guess that's all the time we have today!"  Chris was that kid.  And he never learned anything. SLACKER!","April 3, 2015","false","2.1"," 5 of 22 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","5","22","0","0"

I have had a crash, a bug where no text windows would appear, and another where I could not move after talking to a merchant. My playtime is <15 minutes! Very disappointing.","July 30, 2015","false","2.3"," 2 of 17 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","2","17","0","2"

I know the original was, but this seems to use the same engine and graphics ... you also might want to brush up on your German so you can read a lot of the descriptions that are still in that language.","August 1, 2013","true","4.6"," 5 of 32 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","5","32","0","0"
