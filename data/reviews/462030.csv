"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cazier/recommended/462030/","cazier","Cazier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cazier/","1392 products in account","BitRay has some good ideas, but is unfortunately hindered by a few poor design choices. The game has around 20 levels, each requiring you to ensure that one or more white cubes are kept in play, whilst removing the red cubes from the playing field. The simple physics puzzles are solved by clicking to remove grey cubes and platforms and allowing gravity to take its course (or later, utilising cubes with abilites, such as a jump cube or a cube that shoots projectiles to either side).\n\nThe price reflects the amount of content and general quality of the game's assets. You will probably finish the game in around half an hour. It has some good ideas, but there are a few frustrations that really detract from an otherwise enjoyable game that feels like a good proof of concept for a more expanded title.\n\nThe major flaws are as follows; firstly, the physics occasionally work in 3D. Often (for seemingly no reason) blocks can fall backwards or forwards and out of play. The game would benefit from limiting itself to a 2D plane, where the rules are more clearly defined.\n\nSecondly, doing the same action doesn't always have the same result. This can be frustrating and there is one puzzle in particular that basically requires you to just click a cube and restart the level until you get lucky with how the other cubes fall.\n\nFinally, despite the games short length, it would be nice to have the option to save or at the very least a level select screen so you can pick up where you left off, or replay previous puzzles.\n\nAs such, overall this is an interesting prototype, but needs some more polish and refinement of the mechanics to be recommended. It is however very cheap, so if you're interested its not exactly going to break the bank to try it out.","April 24","false","0.6"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

But then a game-killing bug emerges: the third dimension leaks through in some puzzles.  In other words, blocks topple backwards (!) in a supposedly 2-D game.  This kills any possible solution from occuring.\n\nIf the devs fix this issue, then I might revist it.  And as long as they're listening, here are some more requests:\n- Add a way to exit the game other than Alt-F4.  At a minimum, have the Escape key trigger a "Do you want to quit?" message.\n- Show the current level.\n- Have a way to return to the title screen.  Then you can exit (I think).","April 22","false","0.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Id like to see a whole lot more levels with the block mechanics. I didnt mind the third dimension so much but perhaps it should be limited to a plane to better control puzzle ideas. In general the whole thing could be bolstered on every level and sold as a more complete product.\n\nbut at this price point its a fun proof of concept game worth the pennies just to have a play through or two.","April 23","true","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
