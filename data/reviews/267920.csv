For me, this game is a masterclass in focussed design.  It doesn't try to be clever, with lots of gimmicks that are only there for their own sake.  It just gives you good, solid, arcade-style action, and it does it extremely well.  Your mech isn't loaded with three dozen special features that you completely forget about in the heat of the action.  It does a limited number of things, but those are the only things you need it to do, and they all feel relevant.  Running, strafing, transforming, boosting, barrel-rolling to dodge fire, and all the while firing, firing, firing on the enemy.\n\nYes, it does betray it's Xbox origins in the slightly awkward mouse control and limited graphics options, but honestly, once you dive in and get blasting, it all feels very natural.  The barrel-rolling to dodge in jet mode feels particularly intuitive, as it's on the keys you use for strafing in mech mode (A and D by defaut as you'd expect).  And you can always plug a control pad in if you find the mouse control a bit too hazy.\n\nAs far as I'm aware there's only one voice in the game, the guy who gives you orders, and he puts in a good performance.  Maybe not award-winning, but solid, with simple dialogue, no ridiculous cringe-inducing histrionics, and status updates and encouragements as you progress through each mission.  It's nice to actually be told you're doing well instead of being berated for something or other all the time! =P\n\nIn closing, if you want some simple, straightforward action with just enough depth to be engaging without being overwhelming, Gun Metal is for you.","January 17, 2014","true","1.6"," 180 of 195 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","180","195","0","6"

Now, for 2014, when we have such a developed game industry, with so many choices - not quite...The missions are simply boring. So is the story. There is no difficulty options, and the missions are so easy...I've spent less than 7 hours to finish this game, and 4 of this hours i've spent just on 2 maps (from a total of 13 if i remember it right), the only ones challenging enough. The rest of them (11), i've finished from the very first attempt. They almost all revolve around protecting a city or a group of vehicles. Gun Metal also has no replayability value due to it being so easy to finish, and the lack of achievements or in-game challenges. Considering the release year - it has decent graphics and the maximum resolution is 1600x900.\n\nWith that being said - Gun Metal is still worth to try, especially if you own an old PC and dont have a big choice for the games to run on it, but only on a big sale. Overwise i would recommend to skip it. There are better options for $10 instead of a 7 hour lazy port game with no replayability value.","March 23, 2014","true","9.0"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","35","43","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MorboAntonioII/recommended/267920/","MorboAntonioII","Marco Antonio II.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MorboAntonioII/","250 products in account","I never played this game on the original console so my opinions are about the PC port alone and I've never played it before until recently.\n\nThe game has a very straightforward concept where you pilot a giant robot that can also transform into a jet. While the concept is simplistic the execution is good enough to make the game entertaining and quite unique. In all missions you are introduced right into the action (After a quick mission briefing) and you’ll have to destroy enemy buildings as well as their vehicles using a variety of weapons you’ll unlock as you play. If you’re satisfied by this simple concept, you won’t be disappointed. The game doesn’t have much of a plot other than having you defend your base and destroying the enemy, and sadly the game isn’t very long being a 4-6 hour experience, but it allows you to replay the missions as you unlock them, most of the missions being quite open to different alternatives to go through them due the transforming mechanic, the weapon variety and the size of the maps.\n\nThe controls might be very clunky on the start (Especially the mouse controls) and I won’t judge the people saying it felt unplayable, it takes some time and effort getting used to it but it’s worth it and doesn’t take long to get used to the controls on both the giant robot and the jet, both which control differently and have their ups and downs on their gameplay. Customizing the controls is not hard either, and it didn’t took me long to find the most comfortable settings to play the game with, and I used a keyboard all this time. Give it some time and you’ll blast enemies with accuracy soon enough.\n\nThere’s no difficulty setting in this game, but the game’s only difficulty felt fair, challenging but not frustrating. The enemies are a bit bullet spongy, but as you unlock better weapons it becomes easier to get rid of them as well destroying everything around you. Some weapons felt a bit lame, but it also counts with many satisfying weapons that makes you feel like you’re in a Michael Bay film because of all the explosions and destruction you’ll be causing around you, and this game has plenty of destructible environments.\n\nIt’s a solid experience for those fans of action games and giant robots but it’s not flawless. Some weird experiences I had with it is that the mouse doesn’t work during the steam overlay, and any key you press during the overlay that triggers an action in the game will still work, so you can still play with the overlay open which can be annoying if you need to send a message.\n\nAll in all, I’d recommend buying it during a sale considering its limited length and some of its simplicity, but it was a great throwback to simpler times and I am extremely satisfied with the game.\n","August 25, 2015","true","7.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

It took round three hours to complete Gun Metal, but during these I had a lot of fun. The only thing that you do in Gun Metal is destroying your enemies with more and more powerfull weapons. From dual machine pistols to rocket launchers about a variety of energy based weapons and air to ground missiles you have a very big veariety of weaponsto choose from. Although you can pretty clearly see that Havoc Suit focusses more on "classic" weapons like the machine pistols or grenade launcher the Jet mode has more missiles and air to ground weapons at his disposal. Sometimes I felt that there even are to less weapons suited for air combat, but then again you can also use air to ground weapons to bomb bigger enemy ships in mid air, which is pretty effective. Alternatively you can land on them as well. The missions in the agme are not very hard, just at the end they became a bit tricky, because you have multiple things happening at once.  But even so when this sounds negative the game is pretty fun. Easy but fun. I wouldn't buy it for 10 euro though. But during a sale for 5€/$ it's pretty nice.","October 16, 2014","true","3.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Also, back in a day it featured some really decent graphics, so I loved it even more, as I was able to play it on my new PC without any problems. Well, the times have changed and so did my way of perceiving games. Gun Metal is just as adorably oldschool and dynamic as it is monotonous and frustrating. The difficulty is high, the missions are terribly repetetive, the story basically doesn't exist (ok we are under attack by somebody, here take this cool transforming mech while we remain absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing useless, lol I know, we were able to build this damn thing but we cant fight for ♥♥♥♥, so yeah, you are our only hope, please shoot all the bad guys), and the game (or at least the Steam version, I don't recall such difficulties... well, ♥♥♥♥, 12 years ago) is pretty damn bugged. During the loading screen for the 6th mission the game crashed to desktop and after restarting it showed my savegame as "damaged", thus unable to load. That sucked. Other than that, the game is still fun, mostly thanks to its dynamicity and the sense of power it gives (lots of weapons, explosions and the coolness of a transforming bot). I bought it on Indie Gala for $1,40 because my nostalgia told me to do so.

The game's original developers, Rage Software, went bankrupt shortly after releasing the game.\n\nNow, the game is released on Steam (hooray!), and it is actually quite fun for a game released some time ago. It is very fun to switch between a standing mech and a flying one, whilst destroying anyone (or anything) in your path with rockets and flak guns.  I did have a problem with the game's controls, however. They are very poorly optimized for both controller and keyboard/mouse. I attempted keyboard/mouse, but quickly switched over to controller after having some difficulties.\n\nThe control layout for an Xbox 360 controller is terrible, some of the game's actions are not even configured to work with an Xbox controller by default, so I ended up rewriting all of the controls to work with an Xbox controller. Also, be warned, the game does not run above 1600x900, which was fairly disappointing, I would have at least expected a little better from a game ported to Steam in 2014. Other than that, the gameplay itself is very enjoyable and makes up for these minor setbacks. I should also mention that the story that is present is just there for the sake of having a story and is really not worth listening to.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB21Pe5Af8U","January 22, 2014","true","0.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

In it you pilot a "Havoc suit" that is a humanoid mecha that can transform into a fighter jet and blow stuff up.\n\nThere is a skeleton of a story somewhere, something about the enemy attacking your people and somesuch, so you hop in your prototype super suit and go kick some butt. Because... reasons.\n\nThe missions are relatively straightforward and short: destroy X location, defend a convoy, defend Y location, destroy X,Y and Z locations and then a huge battle ship, etc. They last no more than 15 minutes each (some going for 4 ~ 5 minutes) and I have to say they're fun and challenging. The difficulty level is significant, but it never gets unfair. Each level is some sort of puzzle that you need to figure out in order to succeed and as you progress you will unlock more guns, armor types and fun bits to add to your arsenal to blow stuff up.\n\nThe game however is a bit dated on the graphics. The only problem I had is mapping the controls to my XBox controller, and even when fully mapped by pressing certain combinations other buttons would simply not work. My current set up where I'm most confortable makes me unable to roll away to avoid enemy fire; even though I have the correct setup it works when it wants to.\n\nRecommended purchase in a sale if you want some old school shooting action and want to turn off your brain for a bit.\n\nCheers!","April 14, 2014","true","2.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

That alone, no checkpoints, made me uninstall and begin the process of forgetting I wasted any time on this.\n\nEven if the game had checkpoints, the controls are still garbage and there are two horrible problems. The first is that a lot of times you have to be going in the direction of the sun because enemies are right directly in front of it so you have to stare into a god damn supernova sun while you fight and it will burn your ♥♥♥♥ing eyes. I had to play with my eyes nearly closed half the time. That and your crosshair is barely noticable during heavy action which is always. I CONSTANTLY in all the action and confusion lost my crosshair so most of the time I had no idea where I was shooting. Another problem is that the big ships shoot a constant stream of green lasers that are not dodge-able no matter where you are, and you have to be within range to shoot them so it makes no sense and you get ripped apart fast.\n\n♥♥♥♥ing game blows nuts. NOT a old classic at all, just a old pain. Thank God for the uninstall function.","July 5, 2014","false","0.5"," 3 of 17 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","3","17","0","0"

I have always been a firm believer that a game has to grab you within the first few minutes of gameplay to come to conclusion if you will continue playing. Same with girls choosing within 5 minutes if they will sleep with you. This game brings forth great awesomeness. It brings me back to the old school Afterburner Arcady games mixed in with over the top MECH Warrior action. The graphics are a bit meh, but it pays homage to so many games. I actually enjoy the fact that the developers paid more attention to gameplay than graphics. Love this game, the controllers are amazing, honestly better than most Triple A titles. The action is intest as well. Sorry this review is all over the place, I am far too excited for this game. Buy this game, do not hesitate, stop reading this crappy review and BUY THIS GAME.

It has nice responding controls, an interesting "transformer" mechanic and nice graphics (for its time)\n\nThe action is fun and the gameplay is versatile. The only thing lacking is a more solid story and maybe some multiplayer, if someone where to do a more updated version it would be amazing, specially on PVP.\n\nOverall a nice game.","January 9","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
