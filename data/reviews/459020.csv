The ending was clever and entertaining, if a bit shallow, but I can't recommend a game where sexism sticks out like a sore thumb, especially when a main character does something entirely counter to their goal the entire game. I.E. the mayor, who wanted to save the town the majority of the game, decided to sell the town just to espouse that women were second-rate. Furthermore, if it was meant as satire, it was poorly done enough so as to no longer appear as satire in any way. There was a lot of good in this game, but some of these story choices leave a bad taste in my mouth for a game that was otherwise light-hearted, goofy, and enjoyable.\n\nEdit: 5-8-2016\n\nI still haven't quite finished with the game but periodically the game continues to express very blatant opinions about the place of men and women in society that are degrading to both. Such as the mayor telling his daugther to act like a girl and not the mayor because his son let him down and that leading a town is a man's job so he decided to sell the town they've been trying to save the entire game, despite having never cared about your gender (as you can be either male or female) and always asking you to do stuff for the town. He said it was better to let the town die with him than be led by a woman before laughing about how now he was very wealthy. I'm not sure if these are meant as satire or if these are views actually endorsed by the developers. I seriously hope it's satire, even if the cues of it being satire are nowhere to be found.\n\nWhile the game itself is fine, this part of the storyline actually makes me want to change my recommendation to 'buy it if you can ignore this aspect and enjoy the rest' or to negative because we shouldn't be supporting such sexism.\n\n-Original Review-\n\nScroll down a couple of paragraphs please for the updated one.\n\nIt's full of a lot of surprises despite being a fairly small game. I haven't finished the storyline yet. There aren't a lot of side quests and while there aren't a whole lot of options, it can definitely keep an interest if you get past the relatively slow early game where the characters haven't fleshed themselves or their relationships with others out terribly well.\n\nAt this point, the only real complaint I have is that there was a cute side-story about helping some other folk find love but it turned out to be kind of sexist and heteronormative when it didn't have to be and it only happened at the very end of that little side story. It had been so cute up until that point but it was basically 'moms can't teach kids how to read and write so they need a dad,' 'dads can only teach practical things and are the primary teacher of offspring,' and 'I need a dad because of this' and 'I need a mom because dads aren't tender enough to prevent bad personality.' That was suprememly disappointing especially to have those views espoused by toddlers.  It was a bit derogatory to both men and women.\n\nThe rest of the story beside this side-bit has so far been fairly good, though not terribly original.\n\n-Revised Review- May 4th, 2016\n\nThis game has a lot of good points and some bad points. I've played through, I think, a lot of the game though I'm not sure how far I actually am at about 16 hours into it (like day 100 or so) and I'm sure where I've gotten to could be completed more quickly if things have lined up better for which crops were planted, when someone wanted some dish, and so on. ANYWAY, here's some actual notes.\n\nPros-\n+Interesting, though the original premise of saving a small town from a mall isn't new, and somewhat complicated storyline for the size of the game\n+Characters reveal their personalities and relationships with others over time\n+Somewhat complicated recipe system\n+Funny, if cheesy, descriptions of upcoming events in the mail\n+Large variety of animals and a healthy variety of crops\n+Well-planned, complicated dungeon maps that are set up to encourage you to come back to see what any new mechanics you unlocked can reveal\n+Most side events are at least a cute distraction or genuinely interesting, but not all\n+You don't have to know a damned thing about the first game\n\nCons-\n+Slow start, really slow and your brother is basically the stereotype of a rich, privileged, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ city boy (he is set up as an antagonist and is a very shallow one at that).\n+Graphics, graphics, graphics (the pixels are blown up for the default resolution and it's a little fugly but only really on the character sprites)\n+The farming is really only a means to an end and not terribly complex\n+Livestock are also a means to an end and are mostly for unlocking things as some don't do anything at all.\n+Sometimes you feel very lost about what you're supposed to do\n+Sometimes you have to wait and do nothing while you're waiting for something to happen to advance what you're doing or for that one blasted crop to grow so you can make a dish\n+Fairly shallow romance system and very few choices for either gender\n+The characters you can romance depending on your gender are just gender-swapped versions of themselves. All choices are also heterosexual, but to be fair, it is a small town.\n+No friendship system for becoming pals with the other villagers though it's implied over time that they're cool with you\n+Some side events/quests are kind of tedious\n+At least one side event espouses opinions that are sexist and derogatory to both men and women.\n+Some mechanics seem to have no purpose, but they might be revealed further on\n+The town is very small and many people seem to live nowhere\n+You have to go all over the place to buy ingredients for cooking\n+You can't manually save, you can only save when you sleep and it happens automatically\n\nEither Con or Pro depending on you-\n+The storyline starts off slow and takes a while to get through\n+Sometimes you have to get through certain parts of the main story before you can complete some of your side-quests because mechanics are introduced even fairly late into the game\n+Kitchen available from day one\n+No character portraits despite the adorable store art and menu art that could easily have been co-opted to make character portraits, even if at least for a couple of characters.\n+Winter never ends, one season the whole game (which can lead to 100+ days of winter)\n+No choices in how the storyline plays out, it railroads you the whole way minus the slight extra freedom of choosing from a tiny selection of lifemates\n+Maps can sometimes take a long time to navigate\n+Sometimes the key controls surprise you, I.E. DO NOT WASD. DO NOT DO IT.\n\nSummary\n\nI liked the game and I feel like I've at least gotten my money's worth out of it. Unless something drastic happens, I intend to play the game to the end. It's not some fantastic Harvest Moon for the PC platform, but I'm okay with that. It doesn't have a whole lot of options, but it's a small game and it was also produced fairly fast. If you are okay with trying to unravel a purposefully slow storyline and less interested in the relaxation of farming sims, than this game would be pretty okay for you. I would recommend it, especially since it's not terribly expensive and the developers sometimes put their games on sale. It's an improvement in many ways over the previous game as well, but even if just there's more story.","May 2","false","20.7"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

If you want a well-made game, check out Stardew Valley or World's Dawn.","May 8","false","21.1"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

You start out with access to 3 plots of land to farm. I've played around 6 hours (day ~53) and, as far as I can tell, I've reached the maximum plot count at a whopping 18 plots. There's not much else in the way of farming - you get access to some animals that can be pleased by giving them certain items or using certain items on them, but that's about all there is to it. You are required to take part in town gatherings and occasionally give the mayor some item in order to advance your equipment and the story, but it's all very generic. If there was a half-decent story, I might keep playing, but there's not. There're more destinations for me to visit and perhaps a couple more pieces of equipment to unlock, but I have no desire to play more.\n\nSorry to bash the game, but there was no information out on this game and it comes accross as something it's not. It's not the worst game I've ever played and it's at a cheap price, but don't expect a Rune Factory remake here.\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I'm feeling the itch to keep playing this darn game. I still haven't married and I haven't visited the new market location yet. As such, I feel obligated to edit my review. I've gotten a fair amount of time out of a game I bought for $3.99. It's not what I expected, but it seems I'm drawn to keep playing it.","May 1","true","12.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

I didn't feed the goat and it slowed down my progress in the game- the more you play the better it gets and its adorable and it is alot like Our love will grow 1 but with a twist - there are not alot of people here but I know them all by name- they all give clues for each step of the way- its another adorable game by John Wizard for 3.99 its worth alot more as far as creative game play- its better than the 12.99 Worlds Dawn- if John Wizard puts out more games like this even with a bigger price tag- its worth 15. compared to other game you pay more and get less- I will buy his games again! Very well designed- interesting and so addictive- Don't even listen to anyone who has not really played the game- they gave up way to soon- 6 hours into the game is to soon!  I finished our love will grow-1 and this one is just as good!\n\nEnjoy-10/10","May 5","true","56.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I'm gonna be a little nitpicky even tho I like this game. I saw some videos of Stardew Valley on Youtube and even tho I'm interested, I'm concerned about the controls and how sloppy they seem. I'm really used to RPG maker games and I like how easy it is to use, so obviously I got this game.\n\nI don't know how this compares to the original game, but in this, your parents just died and your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ brother doesn't want anything to do with the farm. Of course, it's up to you to save it and the town. Pretty generic storyline and generic farming mechanics. I like that you don't have to choose which tool to use in order to do something. Especially with how it runs on energy, it could be really annoying if you messed up.\n\nOne of the reasons I got this game is because I thought it would have relationship equality. I wanted to be a chick that romances other chicks, but alas. It's not a dealbreaker for me, but I know some people might think it is. I wish there was more background on each character and more dialogue options. It's easy to 'romance' people just by talking to them each day and to suck up to them at events. I'm not sure what to gift to the romantic options since I don't know them very well. One of the drawbacks of RPG maker games, I suppose.\n\nThe storyline is pretty linear so far. You have to complete events and errands in order to progress and gain items and animals. I'm not very far (only on Day 14 or so), but it can get pretty slow paced sometimes. Also, there's limited amounts of crops you can grow, but since the map is big and has caves and stuff to explore, it's nice not wasting all your energy on crops and only crops. I can't wait to progress and get better tools to get further into the game. There's also a couple of things that bother me, like you can't manually save the game (it saves when you go to sleep) and when it's night time, it's too hard to see some things in the dark.\n\nOverall, I'll recommend it if these things don't bother you. I love farming games and it's a bit of a time killer without making it impossible to step back for a while. It's a cheap and cute RPG maker farming game and there's enough to do without getting too bored. I know it was just released, but I'm hoping some of these things can be fixed eventually or in the next game.","May 1","true","15.9"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","14","29","0","6"
