It runs fine on win8.1 64bit\nSure the graphics are dated but not bad at all for a game of this age.\nGameplay is kind of drawn out but you can use time compression to\nget where you want to be. Hitting the ?/ key displays onscreen key assignments.\nGot it on sale today for $3.39 and it is worth every penny of that.\n","November 26, 2014","true","0.5"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","0"

Brillaint and underated. If your into jet fighter sims, get it!\nAlways Loved Novalogics fighter games. It does seem a shame that games like this are not being made anymore. The worst example is as a Star Wars fan I loved the X-Wing series, XWA was made over a decade ago now and no signs of another fighter sim to come. Seems the same with novalogic and jet fighter games too :(","July 19, 2013","true","0.4"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

Keep in mind this game is from 1998, yet I can't really find a game today (other than IL-2 with mods) that comes close to the depth of this game.","December 26, 2014","true","3.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Nostalgic! This is part of the first games I played. And the first games I played are simulations. This belonged to the pack Flight Mania. Great flight simulation games. Memories! All flight simulation games may be hard to play but they are fun! You fly, you shoot down enemies, you land, so cool! Sigh, the good old days. 10/10. If I can get all these games back, then it'll be awesome!","January 14, 2013","true","0.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Landing was too easy. This game is more of a simcade than a sim.","December 18, 2015","false","1.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The graphical department are very similar to F-22. Controls are still as unintuitive as F-16 and F-22. No tutorial / training mode can be found in the game much like other Novalogic Fighter games. The gameplay is slow and bland/boring. Don't seek out this game for the multiplayer as it is quite dead! Maybe you could give it a shot in LAN but I haven't nor I am willing to give it a shot! Did this game improved at all from F-16 Multirole Fighter? Barely! The visuals are a tad better but that would be all.\n\nPROS:\n+Works on modern computers. Also, XBOX 360 gamepad is supported, but barely, like F-16 and F-22.\n+Improved visuals from F-16 but F-22 are slightly better looking.\n+Simulation seems adequate from what I played, cockpit is well modelized, just like previous F-16 and F-22.\n\nCONS:\n-Dated visuals, graphics compared to modern gaming.\n-Game doesn't completely support full screen as you see the window.\n-Controls aren't very intuitive. Same controls as F-16 and F-22.\n-No tutorial / training mode so you are left out figuring the controls for yourself.\n-Boring gameplay.\n-Poor audio (sounds and music).\n-While in-game, can't access the options menu nor view/edit the controls which that is quite unacceptable in my book.\n-Dead Multiplayer (to be expected though).\n\nOVERALL:\nWell, barely any improvement from F-16 and even F-22. I'm not sure how this game did back in 1998 but now in 2014, I prefer investing time on more modern games, as should you!\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nSame as F-16 and F-22, I would recommend MiG-29 Fulcrum to flight simulation purists and gamers that dig old school gaming only. But in my book, you should stay away and look into modern games instead!\n\nAlso, since you cannot buy a single Novalogic classic and "forced" to buy the Novalogic Classics Volume One: Machines of War package, you better think twice before investing in this as I only found one game worth of purchase, Commanche 4. If you can find this package on a very good and drastic deal, give it a shot. Better, look somewhere else if you can buy a single game at a time.\n\nRATING:\n2.5 / 10","January 4, 2014","false","0.3"," 3 of 26 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","3","26","0","0"
