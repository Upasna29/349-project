A solid FPS with simple yet unique gameplay mechanics that don't come off as gimmicky at all. Slides, grappling hooks, jump pads, teleporters, and perhaps best of all, it's community fuelled thanks to the fantastic easy-as-hell-to-use built-in map editor.\n\nThere's also no gore what so ever, it feels a lot like a sci-fi laser-tag game in that "killing" your opponent gracefully teleports them back to the finish rather than tearing them apart or dropping them to the floor. It feels very much like a sport or tournament and that's fairly refreshing to be honest!\n\nRecommend this game to lovers of classic FPS games like Quake or Unreal Tournament, those who love to design maps and environments, or those who feel like they need something different in the FPS genre.","October 23, 2014","true","27.9"," 50 of 52 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","50","52","0","0"

The FREE demo lets you play competitive, so its easy to convince your friends about giving a chance for this game. If you sick from cheating (like me), this is still your game, because the cheater population is pretty low. I play this game for months, and never met a single cheating person in SM, and this is a very memorable thing nowadays. As you can see on the pictures, this game don't contain automatic rifles, so don't expect anything like it, only laser, rockets, every weapon pinned to a location, so its your call what to choose, but be smart. It's an "unreal" arena battle with low gravity, walljump ability and various team managment (1v1,3v3 - and theres a solution for 2v2) It's not easy to aim here, but the full game containts DM, where you can become skilled, with some practice. Also if any of your friend buy the full game, ask for the Super Invitation. It's free (only cost LP, but not real money) but whitout it, you can only play a few matches/day, which can be very irritating, especially if you close the day with a loss (who likes that? :D) After playing with various games on the highest competitive level for more than 10 years, I recommend this game as much as I can. 10/10","February 18, 2014","true","191.9"," 52 of 65 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","52","65","0","0"

What makes me come back to it is the movementsystem and the tight controlls. You can really do some amazing trick jumps, including walljumps, rocketjumps, rocket-walljumps, grapplehooks and all that good stuff. The thing is, the game does a really bad job of teaching you that you can do this. So the game doesn't make that good of an first impression. To go fast in this game (and belive me, you can go really fast in shootmania) you have to put in some time into it. The mechanics are very unique and takes a while to get a hold of. It has a style of it's own and no other game plays like it.\nOn top of this, it allows player to create new maps and game-modes, items, characters, skins, weapons and more, so it has a ton of content, and there are allways new maps and modes.\n\nThere is a really good arena fps here, but it's hidden under some pretty bad menus and the lack of tutorials certainly doesn't help.

Not pros, but skilled players.\n\nIf you have friends, this game is a definite buy. Sculpt a weenie into one of your levels and invite your friends to play with you.

It was going to be a worldwide game, which was exciting, supposed to have its own tournaments, and was made by the same guys who made TrackMania. The trailer looked fun, intense, and fast, which is just the kind of game I like. The only problem with it is when it launched.\n\nIt had many members/players at first, and it was easy to find a server with your friends on it. Overtime, though, it seems like everything sorta went downhill from there. Less Americans (I'm American) played the game, and soon, there were only players from certain regions. Honestly, if I knew that, I wouldn't have purchased the game. It has different gamemodes and fast gameplay, probably would've been one of my favorite games on PC, but sadly, I couldn't understand anybody on my servers. Once a month, it seemed like, there was finally someone that spoke English, but over time, the probability of finding someone in your country became as small as a grain of sand.\n\nIt's not a buy to win game, thank goodness, and has seperate gamemodes that you can download. However, there are excessive ads on TrackMania2, and after a while, that gets kind of annoying. There are three different weapons, one's similar to a sticky bomb launcher, which you get underground, the lightning gun, which you get in long range gamemodes, and then you have the plasma shooter, as you can see on the title picture, which is the deault weapon you use all the time.\n\nI'd give this dying multiplayer game a 7.5, and please consider this review before you purchase the game. Thanks for reading this, and again, check out my profile for more reviews!","August 10, 2014","true","6.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

It's a fast pased experience with very well refined features and a robust engin to run it all on. Unfortunately, the game is heavily reliant on the contribution of other players, which just so happens to be in very short supply on the ShootMania servers. There's plenty of potential for a good time and it is a very fun game with replayability out the yin-yang thanks to the built in level editor we all expect from any ManiaPlanet game. But with no one to share the experience with, the game simply collects dust, begging to be jump started - my sincearest hopes that it does.

Importing it so you can choose it is something you have to figure out yourself.\n-UI generally is not very intuitive.\n\n-->The gameplay and possibilities are great, thats why I give a positive review. But the low playerbase is a huge drawback for new people. Try the free demo, it lets you play the game almost unlimited.

Even the demo is very diverse and (almost) unlimited playable. But it's worth it just to buy the game because then you just have 10 times of game modes!\nBesides beautiful graphics for an online game on low-performance computers and rarely bad connection to the server. It even runs mostly liquid with serveral players on the same internet connection. Only downside there are many pros (mainly French) who are very much stronger, but if you exerts you will also become better.\nAfter over 500 hours of game experience I can say one thing with certainty about SMS:\nYou can have fun with it very long for a cheap price!\nUnfortunately, the game is now as good as dead because there are only a few people, who still play it.\n\nDeutsch:\n\nAbsolutes Top-Game mit (positiver) Suchtgefahr. Schon die Demo ist sehr vielfältig und (fast) unbegrenzt spielbar. Doch es lohnt sich ebenso das Spiel zu kaufen da man dann einfach das 10-fache an Spielmodi hat!\nAußerdem schöne Grafik für ein Onlinespiel auch auf leistungsschwachen Rechnern und nur selten schlechte Verbindung zum Server. Es läuft sogar meistens mit mehereren Spielern über die selbe Internetverbindung flüssig. Einziger Nachteil es gibt viele Pros (größtenteils Franzosen) die sehr viel stärker sind, doch wenn man sich anstrengt wird man auch immer besser.\nNach über 500 Stunden Spielerfahrung kann ich zu SMS eins mit Sicherheit sagen:\nMan hat für den günstigen Preis echt lange was davon!\nLeider ist das Spiel inzwischen so gut wie tot, da es nur noch sehr wenige spielen.","January 12, 2014","true","560.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I loved the look of the game and some of the movement mechanics like wall jumping. The built in flexibility to allow for community created content. Elite mode is fun to watch. Shooting rockets is fun to watch and do in game. Some of the map content is creative and makes for interesting ways to navigate. The community is pretty good compared to a lot of the shooter communities out there. There are more good things, but these are the ones that instantly come to mind.\n\nUnfortunately there are so many things to hate about his game. The netcode is ridiculous; one bad client connection to a server messes up the game for all the other clients connected. The three dot aiming system is ridiculous; if you don’t want your “laser” to shoot people at a long distance then just put a limit on the distance and don’t come up with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ aiming system. The ridiculous netcode and three dot aiming system further exacerbates a poor hitbox design that leaves large parts of the player model outside of the hitbox(http://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewtopic.php?f=435&t=27831).  That brings me to something else that drives me crazy. The “laser” looks and behaves more like a lighting gun than a laser. Some of the movement mechanics are annoying; just give people a sprint button (no micro jump) and don’t make them float around in the air like they are on the moon.\n\nI could go on and on and on, but I don’t feel like it. My biggest frustrations with the game are listed and they are the ones that ultimately drove me to the conclusion that the game needed to be removed from my system.","July 16, 2014","false","7.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

If you want to get into this awesome game, you should get two of you're best friends and go play some Elite, the most competetive game mode.\n\nTheres also alot of other "fun servers" with modes like Infected or Obstacle.\n\nBut there is a downside. Theres few people playing this game. This is an awesome game that suffers from bad marketing. It has so much potential, yet so little love from the publishers.","December 28, 2014","true","758.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Now then, why is that so? Well,  Shootmania Storm is a game developed by the same guys who made the TrackMania games, and while I wasn't a big fan of the rather bare-bones racing game, ShootMania Storm is probably the BEST example of how to make a rather bare-bones game worth the price. Let's start with graphics, this game (to me, at least) is in the top 5 best looking games of 2013, rivalling Metro: Last Light and Battlefield 4. It's gameplay reminds me of a mix between Quake, Tribes, and Rise of the Triad (More on that later). Each arena has a variety of ramps and springs for you to maneuver around with on the maps, and you weapon is a 1-to-3 shot rocket launcher that also works as a failure/health counter. If you stop moving, you're dead. If you waste all your ammo, you're dead. If you try to take on a crowd of 5 guys because you're too impatient for them to kill each other, you're dead. Simple as that, really! Now that you know about the game, play it! If not for the gorgeous graphics and gameplay, than for the in-depth level creator. Do it now!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MikeMichaels/recommended/229870/","MikeMichaels","standing at the edge of reality","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MikeMichaels/","193 products in account","Simply put, ShootMania is a masterpiece that has gracefully been bestowed upon us mere mortals from the heavens above, giving man kind a final blessing to experience the best of the FPS genre.\nIf you are looking for a competitive experience, ShootMania has so much to give to you. It stands before us all as the final chance for a perfect competitive game. The community it has surrounding this is beyond phenomenal. Even if you're just a casual player, ShootMania still stands as a top quality FPS game that you just cannot ignore.\nMy original reasoning for wanting this game so badly was due to my love for the ManiaPlanet racing game, TrackMania. Just as much as they offer a gem that stands out above all other racing games, ShootMania does the same. If you played and enjoyed TrackMania, you'd understand the value of the game's awesomeness.\nThere are a few people who question the value of the game, be it because they believe it to be a "simpler" version of original arena based shooters or they disregard it for not following the modern outlook that casual based FPS games aim for. However, when you play ShootMania you'll find that the simplicity is the foundation of why this is such a great shooter. It gives such a unique experience when the game offers so much variety without ruining the simple values of the game. Because of this, the game can reward players for their skill, rather than for the gimmicks which the game throws upon them.\nI cannot express enough how much of a great community ManiaPlanet has, so just go out there and experience it for yourself. The game doesn't even cost the full blown prices you see everyday with most franchises, yet it leaves them for dust because of the dedication and love that have been thrown into this game.\nMy only warning which I can give you is that you might just simply not like the style and play of the game. Fear not, if you can embrace it, it is guaranteed to blow your mind and question why every other FPS game doesn't follow such great innovation.\nSo go on, dig in! Play any of the great game modes that are available. Siege and Jailbreak will throw you into a great world of fun, as will the Royale game mode and several others. When you're ready to throw the cards on the table and pack a punch in the competitive community, jump into Elite and enjoy the core value of the game's perfection.\n10/10 - the perfect game.","September 15, 2013","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Since the bullets of the gun you fire travel so slow, you have to shoot where you think your target is going to be, not where they currently are, which is a really cool because it amps up the skill level.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sdoots/recommended/229870/","sdoots","Sdoots","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sdoots/","354 products in account","Applying the Trackmania theory of game design to FPS results in one of the more interesting arena shooters in some time. It's just as french and weird as Trackmania, and getting to see how Maniaplanet is coming together as this and Stadium release is pretty exciting.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the Mania games, when initially released, are ♥♥♥♥. That's being overly harsh, but  the level that the community takes the content to is so far above anything the developers include with the games that it is ridiculous. As a result, what is currently available in Shootmania is pretty middling. You can see the groundwork and tools are there for people to make some cool stuff, but right now, everyone is still playing on the default maps and gametypes, the pro players are still talking in IRC, and the custom content creators are still figuring out what works, and what works that is also fun to play.\n\nTo give you an idea of how one gametype works, imagine a standard FFA match. In the center of the map is a big metal pole. Once someone has captured the pole, respawns are disabled for the rest of the round. Additionally, there is a bigass storm closing on the map the entire round, and touching it kills you instantly, so you have to move towards the middle of the map over time. You can get hit twice by an enemy players weapon before you are killed, as well.\n\nOH AND THE SURFACE YOU ARE STANDING ON DICTATES YOUR CURRENT WEAPON AND WHETHER OR NOT SPACEBAR JUMPS OR SPRINTS WELCOME TO MANIAPLANET ENJOY YOUR STAY\n\nI wouldn't start your PAID experience with the Mania games here. I do suggest you play the Open Beta by downloading the demo, however. Trackmania 2 Stadium is pretty cheap, and is heavily populated at the moment. Canyon is more expensive, and since Stadium is still a pretty recent release, it's pretty empty by comparison.\n\nManiaplanet is one of the most unique...things I've had the pleasure of playing, and I suggest you check it out, from one of its components or another.","March 7, 2013","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

It is easy to learn, but very hard to master.\nThere is an editor for near to everything, and the community has already made very good use of them and created loads of new gamemodes, maps and other features. That is one of pros.\nAlso, there is no 'leveling', no skillpoints, no items, every player is playing under exactly the same conditions (except for hardware of course), what also makes this game perfect for competition, wich is one of the main goals of the game: To be an innovative, competitive, popular new e-sports game.\nAnd there lies the problem, among these words: 'popular'.\n\nOne of the only cons that come to my mind, no, actually, THE only is the lacking of popularity the game deserves. The community is awesome, but small. Too small. But instead of giving a negative review because of that, I think this is the best reason to give a positive review: Because then more people might notice how good this game is, and play it, instead of being put off by negative reviews. It may be true, there aren't a lot of servers with people on them, but there are servers, at least enough to still properly play the game.\n\nAnd finally:  The game is free. Well, not officially, but the demo is free. And the demo lets you play the whole game, with the only tiny exceptions being name customization (with colours and stuff) and custom player skins. So you can technically play the whole game, and at the moment (and for quite a while already) the demo can be played infinetly. No 30-day limit or only certain gamemodes.\nBut if you should play the demo and enjoy it, I would recommend buying the game to support NADEO and even be able to have awesome names like " ツ 〢 ξ〤ה०ा・". In colour!\n\nI'd give this great game 9/10. Definetly worth playing.","June 3","true","23.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
