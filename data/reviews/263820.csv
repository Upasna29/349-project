As for the plot, it is amusing and it is nice to play as the villain for a change. It does get overly repeditive to always play the heroes in this sort of genre so I consider it a breath of fresh air overall.\n\nFor a mere 2 bucks, this game is one of the best deals for fans of the classic action/rpg's from the days of old.\n\nWell done, well done.\n\n","February 20, 2014","true","4.9"," 100 of 112 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","100","112","0","1"

It has some funny moments but also some engagingly bleak ones, do not expect to be a good guy for one second.\n4. A final boss the way a final boss should be... beware.\n\nCons:\n1. Combat can sometimes feel repetitive, you may also feel like the only real challenge comes from bosses unless you are reckless.\n2. Game sometimes feels 'barebones' in respect to itemisation and some areas are repeated with different textures.\n\nTip:\nI recommend playing on hard from the start, I never tried normal but hard seemed just right.\n\nIn summary:\nBuy this game.

I'm sure this little nugget of info has been mentioned by many other reviewers, all the same it's worth mentioning.\n\nHomages are a mixed bag. This is how they usually end up: "Wow! This reminds me of my favorite game...except worse." Evil Quest isn't as good a game as Crystalis, but it's still okay. Evil Quest is about Galvis. What does he want to do tonight? He wants to destroy the world. He kills everyone that stands in his way, and even murders anyone that annoys him. Like any other villain, this guy also talks too dang much. While I can't imagine a mute evil-protagonist working out, by the end of the game I was sick to death of Galvis and his speeches.\n\nAs with most action-RPGs, Galvis starts with a pitiful knife and dirty rags, and his enemies are mere rats and low-ranking grunts. By the end of the game he's wielding the legendary chaos axe and slaying dragons & demons with no trouble. Getting to that point involves the typical town -> overworld -> dungeon progression. The dungeons are standard stuff, lots of respawning enemies, some treasure, sometimes a puzzle or two. It's nothing really involving, but I guess that's to be expected from a game that harkens back to simpler times.\n\nThe only bothersome aspect is that with every level-up, you're given points to distribute. Having stats for HP and DEF seems a bit superfluous, especially on hard difficulty where everyone hits like a truck. Boosting STR and MAG is more effective, mainly because the faster you can kill something, the less chance they have of damaging you. Plus if you want all the achievements you have to focus on two attributes (this will take two play-throughs), because the level-cap will keep you from maxing out all four.\n\nThis game can be really easy, with much of the difficulty being player-imposed. By this I mean you have things on harder on yourself (don't buy healing spells, don't use potions, etc) to remain challenged. However, the final bosses have some cheap attacks that are nearly impossible to dodge, so it's probably not the best idea. A sequel is in the works so the issues involving difficulty should get ironed out.\n\nWhat I'd really like to see out of the sequel to Evil Quest is A) better art-direction B) better plot C) a more involving quest. An old-school bum like myself probably shouldn't care about A or B but they along with C are why I consider Crystalis the better game (well, all that and better difficulty balance). Evil Quest was originally an Xbox Live Indie Game and it shows. The sprite-work is serviceable but not in any way unique, and just looks really banal.\n\nC gets it's own paragraph because it's the most important of the three. A good quest isn't just finding powerful weapons and killing massive enemies. Crystalis gets a lot of credit for changing things up beyond "kill monsters & get money". In one area you could ride around on a dolphin, there was a town run entirely by women, and you had to use a metamorphis spell to talk to their queen, there was also a zombie-infested town, and so on. In a lot of ways Evil Quest is too similar to traditional action-RPGs, which results in missed opportunities.\n\nThere aren't many games where you play somebody who is actually evil. It seems like there would be a lot of cool methods to progress the plot, like using sabotage, threats, murder, etc. Take Kefka from FF6 for example, imagine playing as him. At one point you poison the kingdom of Doma, later on you assist the emperor in fooling the resistance, then not long after that stab the Emperor in the back and take all of the god-like power for yourself. The rest of the game could be spent trying to stay one step ahead of the heroes, slowly picking them off one by one (or in parties).\n\nAll that said, it's not really a huge deal. As a homage throwback whateveryoucallit title, Evil Quest is solid. It has the basics down, and a sequel could turn out to be pretty spectacular with enough creativity injected into it.","October 27, 2014","true","10.6"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","39","42","0","0"

Now to the game, ill drop it in sections to make it easier.\n\nGameplay:\nI was very surprised, im normally not a fan of these kinds of games but the combat was very precise and quick, a easy to do hard to master kind of deal. The RPG side of it i was confronted was oddly simple yet deep enough for me to quickly realise the difference in how i could build a character, it allowed me from the start to know what i wanted to build and how to play with next to no hand holding, i was impressed. Just to squeeze in something i also enjoyed, the boss battles, they actually had mechanics to them that wasnt just walking around and dodging, it added a little more difficulty to the battles and made them more interesting.\n\nStory:\nThe story was quite intriguing, you play the opposite side of the way these storys would normally go, from the evil perspective and how overwhelming that evil is, i actually had alot of fun playing from this side. The story itself is nothing to special but interesting enough to carry you along the path of becoming stronger and beating bosses.\n\nSound:\nIts sound was not terrible but i admit i kinda got sick of it half way through the game, but it is fitting with the game and i enjoyed it up to that point, its kinda a mix of dark upbeat, very much suits the mood of the game.\n\nConclusion:\nIm very happy with this purchase, even at this price point, it delivered on everything i expected and didnt expect, this is a gem for the price that it is set for, and if your into these kinds of games and looking to kill a little bit of time, definantly dont skip over this.","December 6, 2015","true","10.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

It's a nice change to play as the bad guy and want to take over and destroy the world for once. This classic SNES type RPG game did everything right for me. It doesn't take itself too seriously, I mean, c'mon,  you have to kill God....\n\nTowards the end of the game, I pretty much ripped through any enemies in one shot, you can collect some pretty overpowered spells, and if you are like me, and stacked Intellect to get a higher mana pool, you could simply AOE through most zones, mopping up the experiance as you went.\n\nThe game is actually pretty simple. As long as you read the story, you won't find yourself wondering where to go next as it is quite clearly set out for you. There isn't any side quests to complete, however there are a number of achivements you work towards.\n\nI would highly recommend this game if you are looking for something a little different and only want to spend £1,60, you can't go wrong with this five hour long title.","November 20, 2014","true","4.6"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","20","31","0","0"

Simple plug and play with matching graphics on the UI when using controller.\n\nThe retro feeling captured in the game was great. Everything from the graphics to the sounds and score. If you're a fan of the older action rpgs for nes/snes then you'll easily find your money's worth in this game. Speaking of money's worth the pricing was excellent in my opinion.

Cure-3 makes every boss fight completely trivial in that you don't have to dodge all that many things, which should be the whole point of the battle. Personal discipline in not abusing overpowered mechanics can net a lot more enjoyment out of this game.\n\nThe level up system was also fairly lackluster in that it really feels like an unnecessary feature - the HP stat is statistically garbage, the magic stat can be abused to be overpowered.\n\nThose complaints aside, it's a solidly assembled title that works, for its price of $2. If the price were much higher, I'd have probably marked this as a negative review, but $2 is enough to let some non-game-destroying flaws slide, for a game that can offer a decent challenge with mostly working mechanics.","October 13, 2014","true","4.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The main draw of the game is how over-the-top the protagonist is.  It's not uncommon for you to learn spells and get equipment by threatening some NPC and then after getting said upgrade, to kill them.  The entire game is played out in this tongue-in-cheek manner and I found it amusing enough, though some will no doubt find it to be a bit try hard.\n\nThe artstyle is crude and bland at times and dungeons are a bit long and boring to traverse, but the dungeons have save points so replaying long stretches of them shouldn't be much of a factor.  Puzzles are rare and quite simple when they show up.\n\nThe best aspect of Evil Quest gameplay-wise is how easy it is to become a walking flamethrower.  Magic regenerates over time, so if you level-up and make it a point to pump intelligence, by the halfway point of the game you can constantly spam spells as you walk around and it trivializes most enemies.  I don't find this a downpoint since combat is rather simplistic and mowing down enemies with various spells is fun enough.\n\nThe game is pretty short, you probably won't end up with more than a half-dozen hours at most on a playthrough, though that's about right and it ended just as I was tiring of it a bit.

A short adventure worth the cheap price.\n\nThis game is extremely cheap and the premise of playing as a villan is intresting enough, but it's not executed well. The story is a revenge plot about a Dark Knight who is bent on taking over the country, and eventually the world. The dialouge is basic, but you'll probably laugh at how hard the writers tried to make your character "BADASS and RUTHLESS" As far as story is concerned, the game isn't too gripping. It's all about the gameplay here, which was a rollercoaster of good and bad core mechanics. You run around the world killing monsters to level up and collect eqipment and spells. The freedom to be more spell or melee focused is satisfying and well appreciated. Your melee attacks can be enhanced with a charge that turns it into a projectile that deals much more damage. Spells are split up into magical categories and the rate at which they are required is steady and unlocking the next magicical ability is genuinely exciting. The combat is engaging and the bosses are designed to accomodate your large arsenal of skills. On the other hand, the normal enemies are laughable and can easily be killed with continous shots from your sword. The pixelated graphics have moderate details, matching 16-bit era games, but the illustrations used for the cutscenes are unsettling to look at. there is something about the style that I just don't find appealing. The music usually fits the mood with a couple of stand-out tracks(The field theme). If you like action RPG's or the game crystalis go ahead and buy the game. it provides a decent 6-9 hours of gameplay and is fairly harmless when you consider it's EXTEREMELY cheap price.","October 6, 2014","true","7.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I played on Normal, and won the game in only a few hours, and only died once. I'm an RPG veteran, though, so it may provide a greater challenge and maybe an extra hour or two if you aren't as familiar with this type of game.\n\nPlaying the bad guy is... kinda corny, honestly. The main difference is that you fight a bunch of "good" guys and that you backstab almost everyone after they help you. The story is eh, but it doesn't get in the way of the action, so it could be worse.\n\nOverall, EvilQuest is a great buy. At such a low price, it's hard not to recommend it.","February 22, 2014","true","4.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But the bright colors do get hard on the eys after a while.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is decent, but the music kinda bland and reused in some parts.  Not really memorable.\n\nControl:\nThe controls were decent enough and I had no problems with it.\n\nGameplay:\nDespite it's look, the gameplay is good.  You get MANY different attacks to use, from charging your wapon for a LoZ-style ranged attack to screen-wide magic attacks.  You can also set certain  items for a quick slot of easy use during heated battles.  Also, most battles are a challenge without being cheap.  Never do you feel the need to grind to beat the boss because if you just kill the enemies you see on the way, you will be fine.  But money will be an issue when you want (and need) certain spells and armor.  The Cure spells are a MUST!  But most of the important attack spells are given to you.  The story of this game is, despite it's premise, very hilarious and the writing had me smiling.\n\nThis game made me enjoy being an evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥.

This game reminded me most of Crystalis on the NES, though it also has some similarities to Lagoon on the SNES. The map designs are similar as are some mechanics (jump boots.) Early on, the combat is fairly easy, though you may fail if you attack recklessly. Positioning and timing are most important for success, but, unlike the earlier action-adventure RPGs, enemies appear to have predictable cooldowns on their projectiles and abilities, making it far less likely you'll get surprised.\n\nThe controls are responsive, however you can perform only one action at a time like in the older games previously mentioned. The one thing that sets it apart is that you can move and turn your character while attacking, allowing you to control quarter- or half-circle sweeps with your weapon; otherwise, every attack is a forward jab. Opponents can do this also, which can catch you off-guard when flanking a foe.\n\nWhile formulaic, it's a tried-and-true recipe. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the genre and art style.","December 24, 2014","true","5.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Story wise the big difference is this time rather than trying to stop the generic EVIL bad guy bent on world domination you play as the EVIL bad guy bent on world domination.  The story is fine and the EVIL twist makes it all feel fresh even though its about as simple as a RPG story gets.\n\nThe gameplay consists of attacking enemies with swords and such, holding down the attack button for a projectile attack, and some different magic attacks that you can find while exploring, or buy if you save up enough gold.  There are plenty of armor pieces to find to make you stronger, and accessories that make you more powerful in various ways, even a cape that makes you invisible.\n\nThe graphics look good for a 16 bit style, some of the enemies are merely reskined as you progress in the game, but others like dragons and ghost make for a nice visual treat as you make your way thru the game.  The levels are all based on elements like fire and water and look and play nice enough with just enough exploration to give the game some meat.  My only complaint is enemies respawn after you slightly move away from an area, so you can't clear a level per say, the enemies are always respawning.  This dose give you plenty of opportunity to gain exp points and level up, but as the game wares on it all gets a bit repetitive, but at about 5 hrs for a diligent explorer EvilQuest isn’t long enough for this to become a problem.\n\nOverall EvilQuest is a very fun ARPG that lets you experience the generic RPG story of those 90ies RPG's from the eyes of the bad guy and plays like a dream.  For the cost of less than a gallon of gas (in the US at least) this game is an absolute steel and should be played by anyone who likes Zelda like ARPG's or wants to be EVIL.","March 1, 2014","true","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It comes off as something like a late NES or early SNES/Genesis title... if that perspective helps. You are a very powerful, evil dude that gets betrayed by his army and locked up. However, you escape captivity and go on a quest to regain your mighty power and ultimately seek to destroy God himself. Sounds pretty cool, right?\n\nYou basically go around overworlds seeking towns and dungeons. You can do some generally mean things along the way, but you're focus is to find four elemental things and then go to the final area once the barrier is broken. It's some standard, by the books stuff. But it works. Along the way, you fight through monsters and bosses in a Zelda-esque fashion. Defeating them will net you gold, which can be used to purchase equipment to make yourself stronger and items to recover from loss of health, loss of magic, or status ailments. As you progress, you'll find stronger weapons and different spells to help you tackle your foes. Also gained from defeated enemies are experience points. Getting enough of these will allow you to level up. Upon gaining a level, you have the option to distribute a number of points into whichever stats you see fit. This can be fun for building a specific way for different playthroughs. Want to beef up your magic skills? Maybe you want to deal mighty blows with your weapons. Or perhaps you just want to be a well rounded warrior. It's nice for some customization and replay value, yet not too complicated as to overwhelm the player. I also would like to point out that I thought the music was alright, but I do enjoy the art style quite a bit. Guess I'm a softy for that kind of thing.\n\nHowever, every game has its faults, as does EvilQuest. I can't complain too much with the main character being bad, as it is not often done still and keeps things a bit interesting. I guess I just wish they had maybe gone a little further with that idea. Maybe that's just me. My biggest complain comes from some expectations that were built up a bit and never capitalized on. Near the start of the game you get the charge ability, letting you shoot a projectile from your weapon at no cost to magic. You then use this to hit a switch through a wall and open a gate. A little while later is a switch puzzle, where some need to be up and some need to be down. Ithought this would mean there would be cool puzzle elements throughout the game like in Zelda games. However, there weren't much more like that to be found. I guess I was hoping it'd break up some of the grinding and killing, but I guess I didn't need to grind so that part was my own fault. My most minor and rather meaningless complaint is that, in order to get all the achievements, you have to play the game twice. Yet there seems to be only one achievement that absolutely forces you to do it. The one based on difficulty. If you play on normal, you have to beat it again on hard. Also, if you play it on easy, you'll get no achievement, which doesn't make much sense. But it's all in the achievements so it's really not even an issue with the game itself. Hardly worth mentioning but... I did. So... sorry.\n\nIt's a cool retro-inspired action adventure RPG. If you like Zelda games and the RPG leveling stuff, give it a look. The game is only two bucks normally, and even less when it goes on sale. It's very much worth the price. This could possibly have passed for a ten dollar game, five at the least. But the fact that it's only two bucks makes it hard to pass up. Sure, it could use some more stuff in it, but the things included are good, especially for that asking price. So go ahead and get your copy. Forget the hesitation and go for it.\n\nEvilQuest gets a 6/10. Everything is solid. It may not be the longest, most fleshed out, or most impressive, but what it does offer is quite a good experience and well worth the price.","January 7, 2015","true","28.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It reminds of that NES game Crystalis... even the overworld music pays a small homage by remixing it a bit... they didn't think I'd notice. :P It's a bit of a twist on the old cliche tale of good vs. evil as you're basically playing as the bad guy in this game and everything and everyone is trying to stop you from taking over the world... but you're the hero so that's not going to happen. :)\n\nVeteren's of the genre won't have much trouble completing it as it's a fairly straight forward, casual romp with a quest log to keep track of events as you progress. As long as you have some what of a decent memory for things, you shouldn't need any help... and trust me you're not going to get any... it's not the most popular game in the world atm. :P\n\nIt's a bit on the casual side for me though. I played it on the hard setting and used a caster build of straight magic / defense and that seemed to dominate the game quite easily. I guess if you're looking for more of a challenge, play a melee build instead. The game also allows for potion spamming so as long as you're stocked up, you really can't be defeated. Make sure to save your game every chance you get as well because the auto-saving is atrocious.\n\n6 / 10 decent.","February 21, 2014","true","5.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

No. It shares some menus, graphics, and gameplay features, but this has it's own thing going on. With that said, if you were ever wanting a Crystalis sequel, well, this filled that need for me.\n5. Why is it only $2? I don't know, but don't let that throw you off. It's not cheap because it's bad, "too indy", or plain not good enough to charge a higher price. Don't question it.

EvilQuest is incredibly linear, you need to do the temples in a specific order, it won't even let you in to the temple before you have the required items. The temples are also linear, you keep going through a specific path until you get the item that lets you into the next dungeon.

Old School Action RPG by the numbers, with welcome features such as a run button and warp spell. The graphics look fantastic in window mode, but a bit fuzzy fullscreen. Controls are tight but enemy patterns can be unpredictable and frustrating at first.\n\nPersonally I found the plot interesting, there were a couple curve balls I didn't see coming either. Sound FX are on point, but the soundtrack itself is probably the weakest point. Kind of boring and sometimes even off tempo. Megadrive-esque chip music from a pro composer would have been more appropriate, but I appreciate the effort from the two-man team.\n\n8.5/10 overall.

The game plays like any other from the genre, with nothing really special to it. I did notice some rather clunky movement, especially from the enemies. They were a bit difficult to actually hit without taking damage yourself. You'll need to back up after every attack if you wish to kill an enemy. Some sort of knock back would have been appreciated.\n\nAlthough it may be generic, it's not to the point where I don't recommend it.","March 28, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/recommended/263820/","loveandpeace","sigh of dog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/","809 products in account","First of all, I had to think long and hard about whether to give this an overall thumbs-up or thumbs-down.  I finally concluded that since I put in the time to not only finish it but get all achievements, and for all its faults it was only made by two guys it seems so it's somewhat forgivable, that it had *just slimly* earned a thumbs-up.  That being said...\n\nWHAT THIS GAME IS:\n\nAn action-RPG straight from the NES era, very specifically based heavily on Crystalis to the point at which it's basically a poor man's copycat of that game in every way.  I would suggest skipping this and going to play Crystalis if you like the basic gameplay but want to waste as little time as possible, but if you love Crystalis and want more just like that you might as well give this game a try.  When all's said and done, the gameplay itself is actually quite fun with some fairly well-designed boss battles.\n\nWHAT THIS GAME IS NOT:\n\nDeep in any way, shape or form.  The artwork is laughable, the music is horrendous (some of the worst I've ever heard in any game, indie or not; do your ears a favor and turn it down on the main options screen before you even start your game) and the story is nonexistant.  Oh, sure, it has the barest-bones skeleton of what could have been a unique story, taking the role of a villain rather than a hero on a quest to destroy the world rather than save it, but the entire thing is presented in such a paltry manner it would be considered mind-numbingly boring and predictable even by 80s video game writing standards.  And if you're looking for some kind of character depth or heel-face turn or the actions of your character to mean anything beyond basic evil instincts, look elsewhere.  This game's all about being utterly and remorselessly evil, your character starts out as a more twisted take on a Saturday morning cartoon villain and only gets more evil from there.\n\nAside from the fact that I feel the art, music and writing are all inadequate even for an indie game made by two dudes, the attempts at humor fall short and there's a bit much killing and implied ♥♥♥♥ for a game that's meant to be a throwback to the simple, charming early era of Japanese RPGs.  Again, it teeters ever-so-closely to the edge of getting a thumbs-down; however, that basic element of gameplay is fun enough, especially for an action-RPG junkie like me, that it's the game's saving grace.\n\nThere are myriad ways in which this could have been done better, even with such a small team and null-budget; the most fitting comparison I can think of is Breath of Death VII, which is a similar type of NES RPG throwback that had a bit more competence put in the art, MUCH more care and attention put into the music, and writing that doesn't nearly mar the experience with the mentality of a 14-year-old boy who draws dudes getting disemboweled in his spare time; in fact, the follow-up to BoD, Cthulhu Saves the World, displays a much less clashingly unpleasant idea of a villain bent on world-destruction being the hero; it's played up in a much more over-the-top and cartoonish way that fits this style of game much more than the weirdly grisly and depressing 'evil guy' outlook deployed here.  But I'm getting off-track.\n\nBasically, its quality is sub-bargain-bin in almost every way, it's as deep as a dried-up puddle and it's quite short at that (over half my 'gameplay time' here is leaving the game on AFK, and that's with going through it twice for all achievements) but the basic elements of gameplay are so fun in a simple and straightforward kind of way that if you're into this kind of thing you'll probably find it worth the asking price, ideally if it's on sale.  The main point to take from this review is "these guys can and should do better next time, but they're on the right track".","December 10, 2014","true","26.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They are MIDIs. Oh wait, sorry. They're MP3s of MIDIs recorded using the default Windows soundfont. So you can't even use something like TiMIDIty++ or BassMidi to make them sound at least somewhat decent.\n\nThe next issue is the main character. The whole gimmick of the game is "play the villain". By villian, it means "horrible psychopathic murderer". Seriously, there is no depth to the character at all. No tragic backstory, just "let's destroy the world because why not". There is no motivation for playing as him. You don't root for the guy at all. He literally kills people for no reason.\n\nThe graphics are nothing special. Just your usual "retro 8-bit" fare. What you see is what you get.\n\nThe controls are horribly inconsistant, especially in the menus. Sometimes escape exits the menu, sometimes it doesn't. You press 'e' to open your equipment, but can't press 'e' again to close it. The in-game controls are also slightly unresponsive. It does mess you up slightly, but it isn't god awfully unplayable. Also, the best part about the controls is that you can see an enlarged view of the map by pressing 'm'. Except, you can't pause the game with the map up at the same time, making it almost useless.\n\nThe biggest flaw by far is the linearity of the game. There are no sidequests (I don't count achievements because they don't give you anything special in-game). There are also no real "transitions" to the different areas. You just wander around and beat dungeon after dungeon. This is probably why the game takes only around 2 or so hours to beat. There is next to zero real backtracking (which would be good if the game wasn't horrifically short). The only other real thing to go do is to get some hidden treasures (which really aren't that hidden).\n\nThe last thing of note is the uselessness of 90% of your items. Your charge shots can hit switches from far away. How many switches do you need to hit? One. The charge shot itself is also useless 90% of the time as well because you have to charge while standing still. The damage output isn't great either. The only real use is when you have to because the enemy is far away and you're waiting for your MP to regenerate. You later get the ability to jump. How many times do you need to jump? About twice. You later get running shoes, except you have to hold down alt of all things to use them. The uselessness expands to the towns as well. There are inns, but I have no idea what they do because I've never once needed to use one. The only thing you need from towns are potions. The armor you can get there you can usually get a few minutes of play later from a chest. Spells are next to useless to buy. You get most of them in game, and the ones you don't are obsolete or never really used. The major exception are the cure spells.\n\nAvoid forever","August 4, 2014","false","7.1"," 21 of 43 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","21","43","0","0"

But that's really all there is to say. It's playable if you like top-down action RPGs. The combat isn't inspired, and the hitboxes take some getting used to (it's bigger than it looks on your sprite). Attacking is a bit tedious, and magic, especially early on, consumes so much of your meter and takes so long to recharge that you'll find yourself using the first spell, Ice 1, through most of the game, just because it's cheaper to cast. Heal 3 makes the game trivially easy. Once you get that (you can get it just before the ice dungeon), you can almost instantly heal up from any attacks, and unless you get overwhelmed by a rapid assault, nothing will kill you. The final boss can be defeated by standing still and spamming projectiles and healing, even in the hardest difficulty. Hard difficulty is barely that. The only difference is that enemies have tons more health and do a little more damage, meaning fights take longer and you have to heal more often.\nThe characters are one-note and repetative. Your main character has only one mood, angry, and he will resort to murder for virtually every situation. Even some potential allies wind up being killed for essentially no reason. The main character's motivation is nothing more complex than "destroy the world". So yes, in that it features a quest of an evil character, this is an evil quest. However, that is all it is. The other NPCs come in two types: "I will kill you, you monster!" and "Please don't murder me, Mr. Bad Guy!". You will always kill the first type, and usually kill the second type. That's it. There is nothing more interesting to the plot.\nIf you can get this game on some crazy sale, you may as well, if you wanna kill a few hours. I got it for about a dollar. If you can't get it for less than 3 bucks, don't bother, because you won't get much back.","November 18, 2014","false","12.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Additionally the equipment screen is E while the rest of the menus are on Escape. The tutorial mentions the mouse controls, and they, at least, seem sane.\n\nThe Ugly: Save points.

Or at least in terms of doing what old games did right with the limitations they had at the time. It's not incredibly difficult from what I've played, but it's not easy either. It rewards players who grew up with these types of games with an enjoyable experience, and it challenges those new to the style. It's kind of "lunch break" difficulty, I suppose, but you can still die pretty easily if you're not paying attention.\n\nAnother great thing is how the main character is a "fresh" kind of evil. It's been a while since I've seen a bad guy who just does evil things just because he feels like it. Galvis cares about one thing and one thing alone: himself. He's not out to change the world, sorta, and he doesn't have a cause other than making every living thing bow to his authority. Really, when's the last time you saw a bad guy do bad things just for the hell of it?\nIt's pretty endearing to take on the role of "I just want everything to either worship me or sleep with the fishes".\n\nThis game proves that what we now call "retro" can still be done in a way that's accessible and enjoyable for anyone playing it. I know anybody reading this has emulated classic games before, and, provided it's not pure nostalgia, EvilQuest has that exact feel.\nTrust me, if you love that type of thing, you'll definitely want to snatch this game up, especially for that price.","May 14, 2014","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, it is modeled so closely upon that game in terms of both graphical style and mechanics that it can almost be taken for a late sequel . . . almost.\n\nFor you see, instead of a cryogenically frozen, pink-clad Hero of Legend, you play as Galvis, a sadistic purple b*stard who gut stabs anyone who slightly annoys him as he pursues his dream of killing God and destroying the world.  I thought playing a nasty dude to be refreshing initially, but when all was said and done, I found being an evil d*** to be a bit unsatisfying.  Don't imagine from my whining that the creators are out to make a serious statement or anything; EvilQuest's tone is rather airy on purpose, with the game itself being a humorously literal take-off on Crystalis' Japanese title.  I guess I just really like good guys (flawed good guys being the best).\n\nI recommend the game heartily though, since it is cheap, neat-looking and packed with terrific boss fights.

If you're a fan of old-school action-RPG games, or a fan of old-school games in general then this is a highly recommended buy from me.  And at only  $1.99 you can't go wrong.\n\nFor those who may be concerned about the length I wouldn't worry.  There's a slew of achievements for this to lengthen the game and so far I'm having a blast getting them all.  Kudos to the devs on this game!  More please!","July 25, 2014","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If not for that, it wouldn't be worth owning. EvilQuest, is not the kind of game that is fresh, or new. Many of the retro styled games at least try to advance on old ideas; whereas this one is a blatant copy of one of my favorite titles, Crystalis. The charging of your weapon, to the layout of the overworld. There is however a refreshing feeling I have, when playing it. It may be a copy, but it is done quite well. Sure, one could argue, that the sprite design is poor, and cheesily bad. But then again look at LJN; they were charging full game price, and most of their games were hardly playable. One area 'EvilQuest' tries to advance, is the story. Now, back in the old times of NES, and SNES, we were always forced to play as the 'Hero'. This was the way things were; and it worked, damn well, at that. This was the golden age; the stories were good, the gameplay was majorly addicting, and the sprites were done so well, that we could literally see them pop off the screen. Evilquest does some of these things right. But I digress. The story is one area where they advanced, as we get to play as the villian, for once. You start out as a reknowned antagonist named, Galvis. He is all sorts of evil badassery. We are only told this through the title, game trailer, and some of the dialogue. Thus, it is the weakest point in the game. When all you are killing is monsters in the overworld; how can you call your game, EvilQuest? Seriously, this is my only real annoyance. 6/10 Great price, somewhat good title.","March 5, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, I immediately thought of the classic NES game Crystalis because there are so many similiaries. For $2 you cannot go wrong on this game. I love that there are so many indie developers paying homage to the golden age of gaming and this is one that is up there for a must play for anyone who grew up with NES and/or SNES. I art is very amatuerish but do not let that fool you this game is about gameplay. The game does seem very derivative and it seems to get really repetitive the thing that saves it the most is the fact that you are the villian instead of the hero which turns the old school action RPG on its head. Our "hero" is on a mission to conquer and pillage and burn everything good. The story is very similar to other games of its ilk that require you to go through different dungeons and find important items so you can move to the next area. Certain items are required to advance the game and things need to be done in a certain order. There is no objective marker telling you exactly where to go and who to talk to. So discovery is an important aspect of the game just like in the classic 16-bit Action RPGs. There is no excuse to pass up this gem at only a measly $2.","March 6, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If not for that, it wouldn't be worth owning. EvilQuest, is not the kind of game that is fresh, or new. Many of the retro styled games at least try to advance on old ideas; whereas this one is a blatant copy of one of my favorite titles, Crystalis. The charging of your weapon, to the layout of the overworld. There is however a refreshing feeling I have, when playing it. It may be a copy, but it is done quite well. Sure, one could argue, that the sprite design is poor, and cheesily bad. But then again look at LJN; they were charging full game price, and most of their games were hardly playable. One area 'EvilQuest' tries to advance, is the story. Now, back in the old times of NES, and SNES, we were always forced to play as the 'Hero'. This was the way things were; and it worked, damn well, at that. This was the golden age; the stories were good, the gameplay was majorly addicting, and the sprites were done so well, that we could literally see them pop off the screen. Evilquest does some of these things right. But I digress. The story is one area where they advanced, as we get to play as the villian, for once. You start out as a reknowned antagonist named, Galvis. He is all sorts of evil badassery. We are only told this through the title, game trailer, and some of the dialogue. Thus, it is the weakest point in the game. When all you are killing is monsters in the overworld; how can you call your game, EvilQuest? Seriously, this is my only real annoyance. 6/10 Great price, somewhat good title.","March 5, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did not pay much for the game and for what I paid I can forgive a few missed hits here and there. It's better than I could make for sure and the story did make sense for the most part.\n\nAll in all I would recommend it if you are looking for a fun little game.

It's not perfect but it does satisfy the fun I had playing the old 16 and 8 bit games of this nature. Also you get to play from the bad guy's perspective. Too many times games that take this route either wimp out and either A: make you really a misunderstood good guy or B: make your enemies even worse then you are. EvilQuest does neither, you're just straight up evil. That being said the rest of the writing is a bit off. It seems at times that the game isn't sure whether it's tounge in cheek or deathly serious. You'll have some humourous dialouge in one scene that's way over the top and in the next be talking to someone whose family was murdered and ♥♥♥♥♥. It can be off putting to say the least.\nGameplay also has its ups and downs. Everything controls very well and the spells in the game are very satisfying to use but they also bring up one of the other downsides. The spells are extremely overpowered. Seriously just dump your points in intelligence and you can whip through this game even on hard. While this is a downside I can't deny there being a certain perverse glee in wiping out a whole screen of enemies and eating the bosses for lunch half-way through the game.\nThe one thing that really bothers me though are some of the enemies (mostly the bosses) hitboxes. This ones kind of hard to explain but it's the worst on the first boss a giant knight. I was standing behind him but for some reason his helmet was hitting me and killing me because the game thought I was touching him. This problem occurs in a few other bosses and considering that this wasn't a problem in actual SNES titles it's a bit unforgiveable here. In fact I almost quit right there but I am glad I didn't as the game is much better then its opening dungeon would suggest.\nAll in all give this one a try. Despite its downfalls it is still one of the better "retro style" games out there in a sea of similair games that are much worse.

In fact, it is modeled so closely upon that game in terms of both graphical style and mechanics that it can almost be taken for a late sequel . . . almost.\n\nFor you see, instead of a cryogenically frozen, pink-clad Hero of Legend, you play as Galvis, a sadistic purple b*stard who gut stabs anyone who slightly annoys him as he pursues his dream of killing God and destroying the world.  I thought playing a nasty dude to be refreshing initially, but when all was said and done, I found being an evil d*** to be a bit unsatisfying.  Don't imagine from my whining that the creators are out to make a serious statement or anything; EvilQuest's tone is rather airy on purpose, with the game itself being a humorously literal take-off on Crystalis' Japanese title.  I guess I just really like good guys (flawed good guys being the best).\n\nI recommend the game heartily though, since it is cheap, neat-looking and packed with terrific boss fights.

Or at least in terms of doing what old games did right with the limitations they had at the time. It's not incredibly difficult from what I've played, but it's not easy either. It rewards players who grew up with these types of games with an enjoyable experience, and it challenges those new to the style. It's kind of "lunch break" difficulty, I suppose, but you can still die pretty easily if you're not paying attention.\n\nAnother great thing is how the main character is a "fresh" kind of evil. It's been a while since I've seen a bad guy who just does evil things just because he feels like it. Galvis cares about one thing and one thing alone: himself. He's not out to change the world, sorta, and he doesn't have a cause other than making every living thing bow to his authority. Really, when's the last time you saw a bad guy do bad things just for the hell of it?\nIt's pretty endearing to take on the role of "I just want everything to either worship me or sleep with the fishes".\n\nThis game proves that what we now call "retro" can still be done in a way that's accessible and enjoyable for anyone playing it. I know anybody reading this has emulated classic games before, and, provided it's not pure nostalgia, EvilQuest has that exact feel.\nTrust me, if you love that type of thing, you'll definitely want to snatch this game up, especially for that price.","May 14, 2014","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If not for that, it wouldn't be worth owning. EvilQuest, is not the kind of game that is fresh, or new. Many of the retro styled games at least try to advance on old ideas; whereas this one is a blatant copy of one of my favorite titles, Crystalis. The charging of your weapon, to the layout of the overworld. There is however a refreshing feeling I have, when playing it. It may be a copy, but it is done quite well. Sure, one could argue, that the sprite design is poor, and cheesily bad. But then again look at LJN; they were charging full game price, and most of their games were hardly playable. One area 'EvilQuest' tries to advance, is the story. Now, back in the old times of NES, and SNES, we were always forced to play as the 'Hero'. This was the way things were; and it worked, damn well, at that. This was the golden age; the stories were good, the gameplay was majorly addicting, and the sprites were done so well, that we could literally see them pop off the screen. Evilquest does some of these things right. But I digress. The story is one area where they advanced, as we get to play as the villian, for once. You start out as a reknowned antagonist named, Galvis. He is all sorts of evil badassery. We are only told this through the title, game trailer, and some of the dialogue. Thus, it is the weakest point in the game. When all you are killing is monsters in the overworld; how can you call your game, EvilQuest? Seriously, this is my only real annoyance. 6/10 Great price, somewhat good title.","March 5, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love that there are so many indie developers paying homage to the golden age of gaming and this is one that is up there for a must play for anyone who grew up with NES and/or SNES. I art is very amatuerish but do not let that fool you this game is about gameplay. The game does seem very derivative and it seems to get really repetitive the thing that saves it the most is the fact that you are the villian instead of the hero which turns the old school action RPG on its head. Our "hero" is on a mission to conquer and pillage and burn everything good. The story is very similar to other games of its ilk that require you to go through different dungeons and find important items so you can move to the next area. Certain items are required to advance the game and things need to be done in a certain order. There is no objective marker telling you exactly where to go and who to talk to. So discovery is an important aspect of the game just like in the classic 16-bit Action RPGs.

There are quite a few areas to explore and the story is pretty standard for a JRPG.\n\nBut the writing, overall plot, and execution are lacking and need refinement or maybe someone more experienced in those areas. The game starts off with a bit of humor, but then half-way through loses that and the potential for some comedic moments.

Two buttons.\nStory is funny and engaging.\n\nThe Bad:\nCut-scenes and dialogue faces are crudely drawn (like by hand using Mario Paint).\nGraphics are reminiscent of NES/SNES rather than super-powered like the current generation of games.\nStory is a little fun but nothing to really write home about.\nYou don't get a team of friends so if you die it is ALL YOUR FAULT.\nMost NPC dialogue is useless.\nEven useful ones who tell you where to go next are a bit vague.\nSome exploration of the world is required to figure out where you're going.  (Only bad if you're in a hurry.)\nMusic is not so great.\nAfter 2/3 of the game (maybe less) the combat and treasure hunting style gets a bit old.\nBoss fights are not very challenging.  Just use bigger magic and have more HP than regular monsters.\nThe story is linear.  But maybe (if you like FFII or Legend of Zelda) you like that.\n\nThe Ugly:\nEvery face drawn for dialogue or cut-scenes!  Ha!\n\nFull Review:\nIt is very much like an old NES or maybe SNES game in terms of the style.  So it's a bit like FFII or the first Legend of Zelda game but you play the enemy boss trying to conquer the world instead of a team of heroes trying to save it.  You advance the story when you reach a certain place at a certain point and you get a little "cut scene" or else a dialogue scene... be warned though the art for these is pretty bad.  Looks like it was hand-drawn by a six-year-old.  Between these scenes you are basically free to roam the world.  You can go from town to town by walking across a desert or a forest or whatever.  You will encounter enemies on the map.  They usually will chase you as soon as they see you.  You may have to fight multiple monsters at once.  Fighting is REAL TIME and simple:  hit them with a weapon or magic to kill them before they get close enough to hit you.  Much like in Zelda.  Enemy attacks vary.  Rats and wolves attack by just running into you (I suppose they get in close and bite you).  Soldiers often swipe at you with swords or lances.  Beware in the first dungeon, those lances have a long reach.  The flaming skulls toss fireballs at you.  Some other monsters can throw lightning bolts that go straight up/down at you and then turn to go straight left/right.  Bosses are like normal monsters but they have different movement and attack patterns and usually a lot more health.  And then you kill enough monsters to levelup.  You get a few free upgraded stats, and you get a few points to allocate as you choose.  The higher your level gets, the more upgrade points you get.  You start with 2 per level, then you get 3 after a while, etc.  Once you make it to town you can also buy upgraded armor, shields, rings, magic spells, and recovery herbs.  And you also find some of that stuff in treasure chests.  Much like Final Fantasy.  So yeah it's a little bit crude but it's DIFFERENT.  If you like the SNES/NES era rpg's (FF1, FF2, Legend of Zelda, etc.) and you feel like playing as the villain, then you'll get a kick out of this.

But not good. Without going out of my way to look up the creators' bios, I'm going to say that this is an early effort from a couple of guys who wanted to create a whole game by themselves--design, programming, art, and music--but who weren't experts at any of the above. This is the kind of game you'd expect to find as a curiosity in the "early portfolio" section of someone's website while they keep working to develop more mature work. I'm kind of surprised it's up for sale.\n\nThe art is dull. You'll see every enemy type in the first couple of dungeons, and then it's palette swaps for the rest of the game. Environments, level designs, all forgettable. Bosses are a little bit interesting to look at, but not much.\n\nThe music is poorly produced and forgettable.\n\nThe writing is simply miserable. There is no reason to care about the plot or any of the characters. There are no funny or clever lines.\n\nThe gameplay is tolerable. Controls are generally responsive. But there's nothing to keep you interested. Enemies either rush you or rush you and shoot at you. You respond by whacking them with a sword or axe that doesn't feel all that satisfying to swing, and occasionally with long-cooldown spells. You get periodic armor upgrades that are strictly numbers-up, no gameplay changes or new character art, and a handful of weapons that all do the same thing. I never got frustrated playing, but I never got excited either.\n\nI suggest passing on this one.","January 1","false","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/recommended/263820/","LVS84","Little B Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/","416 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sERX8FIoKJE\n\nEvilQuest is Zelda-like ARPG.The most intriguing thing here for me is you are the villain. It's breath of fresh air. The story is simple. You are Galvis – dark knight, who wants to kill the good guys, take over the world and annihilate it. For that purpose, he needs the Chaos Axe, but it's protected by four seals and Galvis have to destroy them. This isn't oscar winning story and I don't consider it a bad thing. The guy wants to destroy the world – nice and simple.\n\nThe graphics are retro pixel art and you won't find much options here. Sliders for music, effects, difficulty setting, auto save, flash effects, fullscreen and resolution. 1280X720 pixel is the maximum here and this is the biggest issue. But I have one problem, but it might be isolated case. My PS2 controller is not compatible with the game. But mouse and keyboard setup works perfectly. And you can rebind keys.\n\nLike I said in the beginning, this ARPG. You can attack only in four directions and the starting weapon is a knife. Soon after you start the game you will gain the ability to charge a shot, by holding the attack button for a few seconds. This is essential for surviving. In addition to shooting enemies from a distance, this will help you push hard to reach levers. There are three charge levels. Longer you hold, more powerful will the shot be.\n\nAs the game progresses, you will find new weapons. They are connected with your quest. Every new weapon is more powerful than the old ones, so you don't need to use the previuos.\n\nIf the game have only weapons, I wouldn't recommend it. But fortunately, you can use magic. They are pretty standard – fire, lightning, ice, water and earth. Every spell have two levels and they differentiate in their animation and usefulness. My favorite is Earth 2. When you are in a tight place with multiple enemies, a giant rock start ricocheting in the walls and damage everyone in the process.. You learn the spells from certain people, but if you missed someone, you may be abble to buy some of the in the shops.\n\nThe level design is nothing special, pretty standard for old school game like this. But the environments are different – dungeons, volcano, grassfield and so on. While wandering, you will find villiges. There you will buy new gear, hearbs for restoring life, mana, antidotes, spells, sleeping, learning about places you have to visit, searchis houses and so on.\n\nMap exploration is recommened. Beside gaining xp by killing enemies, you will find treasure chests with money, herbs, gear and others. That way part of the money will be saved for something expensive.\n\nEnemies are also typical for the genre – ghosts, soldiers, lizard-like people, bats, rats and so on. A lot of them are just reskin of each other. What I mean is the attack pattern are the same. Of course, there are other with totally different attacks or combine two. The AI is basic, but it works. As a hole it's okay.\n\nEnemies constantly respawn, so you don't have to search for them to gain XP. After leveling up, you will receive different amount of points and you have to put them in 4  skills – strength, vitality, intelligence and toughness. You can't put more than 2  in one place. There is one thing I don't understand. What defines how much point I get? Sometimes I earn 4, other 2 and then 3. As far as the bosses, all I can say is they are ton of fun and you need different approach for each.\n\nSound design is good, it' on the level of older 16 bit games. Every sound of weapons, magic, the effects as a hole, remind me of them. The music is the one thing I don't like that much. It's just not memorable for me.\n\nI had a lot of fun and this fun cost only 2E or your regional equivalent. You'll get great game, especially if you are into Zelda-like games. It took me little more than 4 hours, although Steam says 7. The dev done a great job of recreating 16 bit game. It's almost perfectly polished for what it is, aside from the low resolution. I recommend it. There is EvilQuest 2 on the way and it looks better in every way. Can't wait to get my hands on it.","June 10, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is absolutely spot on with great combat, story, characters and general gameplay.\n\nCombat: While it is a simple swing your sword (or axe) type of game, it requires just enough timing that it isn't on the end of SUPER HARD OMG I CANT HIT ANYTHING or everything just keeps dying there's no challenge! With different enemies ranging from projectile shooting ones to just regular (easier) ones that only do damage when you touch them, it makes you learn the enemies. There's also magic with many different spells throughout and a charged projectile attack so make things easier on those annoying bosses.\n\nStory: It's a fairly straightforward story but provides an interesting direction to the game. Many of the conversations that Galvis has with other characters provides for interesting content and quite a bit of humor.\n\nCharacters: Aside from Galvis, the other people in towns provide information on direction in the storyline, just enough info that you'll have to pay attention but nothing overly detailed that's confusing so you can get right to the next part.\n\nGameplay: From herbs and potions to spells and weapons, there are quite a few items that can be bought and gathered to increase your stats (attack, defense, all that). The leveling up system in this is also spot on. There's never a time where things are too easy or too hard due to the perfect balance. Certainly bosses can be difficult (as are any enemies you don't understand yet) but once you get the pattern, it's just the right challenge for your level.\n\nOverall, great great game, easy to get into and well worth the price.","August 8, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Play on difficult if you have played any video game ever.\n\nEnemy AI, if you can even call it that, is so bad that you can easily approach and attack things with no danger. They are super generous with the amount of healing items you find as well, which you don't really need unless something weird happens.\n\nThe last boss is God, and he was hitting me for 0 damage with most of his attacks. I just spammed my basic attack on nearly every boss in the game, not even caring if I was getting hit. They'd usually die before I had lost 25% hp.\n\nStill, it's like .99 cents, so why not.","February 19","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There was nothing too spectacular about the story. The towns, scripting, npcs, and dialog were decently done. My dislike would be the boring-ness of the trash mobs enemies - the unoriginality, and their weak AI.\nThe maps outside of the towns were also unoriginal and felt like simple paths.\n\nBoss fights were scripted well and were a delight to play. Items/Skills management was also enjoyable to use and the Stats management UI had no issues.\n\nI would recommend this game 7/10, only if you can get this for really cheap.","January 12","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have only played this game and beaten it once.\n\nI think this concept is interesting, I love playing as a villian or antihero in a game gives you a different perspective.\n\nThe early sections of this game are pretty hard, especially the first few bosses though the normal enemies are pretty easy, the problem is this game has a REVERSE difficulty curve.  Meaning that as you go through the game the normal enemies start hitting for ridiculous damage, and the bosses become cakewalks.  I HATE THAT!  The hardest boss (for me) later in the game was the salamander and even then he wasn't that hard, I beat the final boss on the first try without much healing and it is a 3 stage boss, and there is another boss before him.\n\nOverall a dissapointing game, but helped burn a good chunk of time.","December 3, 2015","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

EvilQuest has numerous flaws (mediocre spritework, sometimes-questionable game balance, and awkward dialogue among them), but that's kind of a "you get what you pay for" situation. That said, it's well worth that $2 admission.","December 31, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed it on XBLA, and I tried to get it to work on my PC, but to no avail.  I'm using Windows 7 for those that are curious.  I really tried to get it to work, reading the forums and all, but in the end, I opted for a refund instead.  It's got great gameplay, a great story.  I just couldn't get it to start on my system.  If it works for you, it's a really good game.","May 25","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
