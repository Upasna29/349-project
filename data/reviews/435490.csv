A great variety of games to play with multiplayer and leaderboards and a great looping soundtrack in the background that is just as immersive as the room full of machines itself.  Pierhead Arcade is an early access title but is fantastic and I can't wait to see what more appears in the arcade in the months ahead.","April 6","true","2.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Then, I get a vive, and now My dreams have come true. Perfectly modelled machines which play exactly how they should do, but with amazing score tables including local and worldwide charts, far better than you'd ever see in a real arcade. And how much for this dream come true? Six quid! It's absolutely mental, surely the bargain of a lifetime. I would happily pay Â£10 per additional machine they added to the arcade, but they're going to keep it growing for FREE! So far I've had over ten visitors to my arcade, and everyone, young and old, has enjoyed it as much as a trip to the seaside.\n\nVR was made for experiences like this. It'll keep you fit too, I've thrown more basketballs today than I ever have in the real world. Now, should I take this opportunity to suggest they add a coin pusher/flippa winna next? Amazing work guys.","April 23","true","12.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It Currently has 6 arcade machines in game, all fun and all work well. Me and the wife had a blast playing like we were in the arcades. At least 4 more arcade machines are promised at the end of april, and hopefully more. This is what VR games for me is all about. Plese support the Devs for a small price, game is worth it.\n\nFYi there is also network mode to join others arcade and all player together, though obs small player base so cant fully test how well this works.","April 12","true","1.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Very fun for family and party group. It has MP but I have not tried that yet but I don't see how that can make it worse when it gets working peoperly. It is experimental at this point. Get this if you just want some simple fun and relaxation. You do get a small workout from the range of motion used. It is a must buy for the price.","May 30","true","2.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Hopping in to play a few games of skee ball or shoot some hoops is a great way to kick off an extended VR session or wind one down. It works well in quickie bursts (such as when demoing to friends), but equally well if you really want to dig in and go for a high score on your favorite machine. It's easy to lose track of time as you keep telling yourself "just one more round..."\n\nI'm happy to have jumped in during early access, as new features and games are being adding regularly and the devs are really responsive to feedback and feature requests on the discussion board. If you have a Vive, I highly recommend picking this up! I find myself returning to it often as a solid staple in the VR lineup.","April 27","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I waited until my VR hype calmed down before writing this review. The few minigames in Pierhead Arcade are satisfying and that's mostly thanks to the sound design. Everything behaves and sounds like you would expect it. If you're not into early access games, I'd advise waiting until this gets a more polished interface and better multiplayer support. The 3D environment is also visually simple compared to the great design that went into the arcade machines.\n\nFinally, it's a very well built product at its core that mostly needs work on the visual assets to make it feel like a complete experience.","May 9","true","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While this game doesn't exactly innovate any of the carnival games contained within, it does deliver them well to the medium. Every game is responsive and does what it should. I have not tried this game on-line or in co-op so I can not speak to the netcode (yet, hopefully I will remember to update this after I have tried it.) Controls for all games are solid.\n\nPros:\n+Skiiball.\n+Intuitive control scheme makes playing any game a breeze.\n+The games function as they should.\n+Click to teleport and room-scale locomotion is done well.\n\nCons:\n-Boring atmosphere. Just a giant empty room with a row of games side to side.\n-You can cheat some games, such as Super Punch, just by moving your controller over the targets.\n-There are some gamebreaking bugs that will render some games unplayable until you restart the game. For instance, in Super Punch you can throw your boxing glove outside the range of movement. If that happens you can't get close enough to pick it up, so you can't play the game.\n\n","April 27","true","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is so much fun. It perfectly emulates an oldschool arcade. The arcade machines are all very detailed and well modeled and more are being added over time thanks to a very active developer. "Binary Dash" is probably my favourite game so far closely followed by the shooting gallery. The only thing I'd like to see is maybe some kind of rearrangement of the arcades into anything other than a line so that the environment somewhat resembles an actual arcade, although making more machines should be a priority at the moment. A way to spend tickets would also be great - possibly to unlock stupid little trophies like keyrings, boxes of crayons, lollipops etc. The game is priced very competitively so I'd say grab it if you can.","May 19","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
