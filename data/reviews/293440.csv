You play as Elliot, a young man with a troubled past, afflicted by a powerful curse. The story here is secondary and is conveyed through short, vague cutscenes and occassional flashes of internal dialogue. It has yet to draw me in and is so far nothing more than a simple backdrop for the game itself.\n\nMechanically the game is very impressive and satisfying. You start with the simple ability to shoot and jump. Jumping is floaty and allows for change in trajectory mid jump which enables tricky platforming sections and the ability to fight in mid air. The arrows Elliot fires travel along a set arc rather than directly ahead allowing you to kill grounded enemies from above and calculate your aim. Killing enemies in succession fills a 'chain' meter in the bottom left of the screen which seems to increase your overall damage, of course it could be doing anything which leads me neatly to my next point.\n\nElliot Quest in true old-school style presents incredibly little in the way of tutorial, granted there's not a lot you can do at the start, but simple keybinding would have been sufficient.  This becomes a greater problem later down the line however as new items and upgrades  don't even come with a line of text explaining what they do or to what extent. Additionally, the game contains no options whatsoever beyond adjusting audio levels. No remappable keys, no screen-size options, nothing. The game opens in a window by default which can be maximized but cannot enter fullscreen and while controller support exists it does not seem to allow control with the analogue sticks, these are, however, only minor criticisms.\n\nThe game employs an overworld map with sidescrolling levels and enemy encounters (think Gargoyle's Quest on the gameboy).The metroidvanian influence becomes clear during the first level as I was soon presented with inaccessible secrets and shortcuts I would have to come back to later with enhanced abilities. Those who care to explore will be rewarded with many 'secret walls' and rooms containing treasure, all optional and all hidden. There are a number of collectibles to find including rare treasures which are housed in Elliot's trophy room and  11 crystals - I have no idea what either might do, but I want them all.\n\nThe first dungeon boss bestowed upon me the power of the wind which can be used not only as a means of traversing new areas, but for combat aswell, allowing me to travel through enemies and stun them while still being able to fire arrows from within my mighty typhoon. Pretty much all spells and items thus far have had different uses in and out of combat making the upgrades you receive feel more meaningful as opposed to simply being a tool to beat the dungeon it was found in. The inspiration from the Zelda series is undeniable here from the dungeons, to the items ,even the aesthetic. And as expected, before long, I found ERROR sitting happily in one of the village houses.\n\nGraphically, the game creates a pleasing, simplistic pixel world with vibrant colours and a charming style. Nothing fancy here, and I wouldn't ask for any more. The soundtrack  by Michael Chait is well constructed with suitably archetypal tracks that scream 'dungeon, or 'town' or 'forest' (which if I didn't know any better was a straight rip from A Link to the Past's lost woods theme). Some of the compositions are very enjoyable to listen to and knowingly harken back to the 8-bit classics the game so heavily resembles.\n\nMild rpg features such as exp and skill trees grant a sense of purpose to the never ending slaughter in which you will partake. Enemies respawn every time you exit and re-enter an area and many cannot be comfortaby avoided. The fact that even when revisiting an area for the umpteenth time and having to kill the same enemioes over and over, im still benefitting myself reduces much of the drudgery of backtracking. Additionally the passive abilities granted by the multiple skill trees can assist somewhat in combat and help to vary gameplay styles a little potentially aiding replayability. By the time the second town is reached the gold gained from backtracking and grinding can be put to good use for more meaningful equipment upgrades, Elliot keeps getting stronger and the pace never slows.\n\nOverall Elliot Quest is a fun, suitably challenging (the difficulty seemed to leap up after the first dungeon, compounded by the fact that health is scarce) adventure-platformer that should appeal greatly to sidescroller, Zelda and metroidvania fans. It's a little rough around the edges but the gameplay shines through. There's a meaty amount of content on offer here, rife with secrets, shortcuts and easter eggs. There are a few frustrations such as sometimes cheap insta-deaths (which can be a real pain late on in the game as dying results in loss of XP), and I got painfully lost on more than one occasion, but those looking for a challenge should feel right at home with Elliot Quest's old-school style of action platforming.\n\n=EDIT=\nDeveloper Ansimuz has continued to patch and update the game. Fullscreen option can now be toggled from the ingame pause menu. Game fixes and enhanced pixel resolution have also been added.\n\nPros:\n+Nice overall difficulty\n+Exploration is fun and rewarding\n+Classic dungeon delving meets metroidvanian upgrade syatem\n+Clean pixel graphics\n+No hand-holding\n\nCons:\n-No hand-holding\n-Backtracking can become a tedious memory game\n-Some music tracks border on plagiarism (overall nice)\n-Lack of polish\n\nScore: 8.5/10","November 11, 2014","true","24.5"," 52 of 60 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","52","60","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seorin/recommended/293440/","seorin","seorin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seorin/","1085 products in account","As an obvious homage to Zelda 2 for the NES, Elliot Quest largely succeeds, but a handful of serious flaws hamper what would otherwise be an easy recommendation. As such, I'd only recommend it to players who like the style of game enough to enjoy a budget version that falls short of its potential.\n\nAwkward and frustrating mechanics really cut down on the fun in leveling up and exploring. The low level cap prevents you from maxing your abilities. Experience loss on death punishes you for falling down some pits while others contain secrets. Several abilities only have a small chance to activate, meaning you will often die from something that you easily could have beaten if only your abilities had worked.\n\nExploration also feels extremely limited and unrewarding. In contrast with other games of this style, Elliot Quest has you constantly running into walls instead of finding new areas to explore. Often you'll finally get past one barrier only to find another on the other side. Your eventual reward is then too little too late: mere coins or exp for finally getting through the area you've revisited three times.\n\nElliot Quest is not a bad game, but it suffers from numerous rough edges that take quite a lot away from the parts that are supposed to be fun.","January 18, 2015","false","14.8"," 75 of 97 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","75","97","0","10"

There's a good blend of action, puzzle solving, exploring and traversal. A lot of what the game does, others have done before it with a few exceptions such as a whirlwind attack that pulls in enemies and items that also lets you cross large gaps or cut through green vines.\n\nYou play as a boy named Elliot on his way to rescue Cara. Its a typical plot for a typical game. Every so often text will appear telling you about Cara or what she means to Elliot, but beyond that the story and plot are an afterthought.\n\nThe time was spent in making little traversal puzzles that feel engaging. Defeating a snail and using its shell to get to a higher place. Throwing the body of a stone spitting octopus into purple goo to travel across. Rolling a giant bomb off a cliff are just a few ways the game turns the typical into engaging.\n\nYour primary weapon is a bow with short range arrows. Gravity affects your arrows and it turns the game into one of skill and finesse. There's a nuance to timing, gravity and enemy location that more games should have. Shooting off a cliff to have gravity take your arrow down onto an enemy is satisfying. At some point you can unlock a charge shot that launches the arrow straight forward with no drop off. This charge shot results in a critical hit every time rather than a small fraction of the time.\n\nAlong the way you get a number of different items, skills and abilities. You gain a shield that you can use to block projectiles if you are standing still, a double jump feather, a shovel for digging, a lantern so you can see in caves and light other lanterns, a limited supply of bombs and much more. The only catch to the bombs is that they have to be purchased or found in a specific spot. So if you run out, you'll be headed back into a dungeon to replenish your supply. Defeated enemies will drop hearts or magic pellets to restore health and mana.\n\nWhile the game is a 2D side scroller for the most part, there is an overworld map with several locations some are hidden and you need to touch them before a bubble comes up indicating you can enter. There are a few towns, labyrinths and out of the way places to explore. In the labyrinths these are so big that you'll get a map indicating which room you're in. Its nice to have, because there's a lot you can miss and a lot that you'll need to come back for once you've got specific abilities. You'll have to scour a lot of places several times over.\n\nThere are a couple of enemies on the overworld that you can run into. These enemies send you to one of a few random side scrolling battle zones. These zones are well thought out and can be little mazes by themselves. One has an old key for a house door, another has a bag. It adds exploration and intrigue to what could have been mundane.\n\nThere are often labyrinths on your way to labyrinths; the second of which is the one with the boss fight. The boss labyrinths have keys and giant keys needed to unlock boss doors. Guardians can be found in select locations across both types of labyrinths.\n\nWhile you're scouring dungeons, you can come across heart containers that increase the maximum amount of your health and green elixirs to increase your maximum mana. Its a mechanic used it plenty of other adventure games, even action games and it helps give a sense that you're getting better. There are plenty of other things taken from its inspiration, but there's always a twist to them in order to make them feel fresh. Stone shooting octopi are only vulnerable when they're shooting at you. Slime will split into other slime.\n\nMake sure to push up against every wall, because there are frequent hidden areas that become visible only when you've found them. These are nothing mandatory, but they do contain plenty of chests with gold inside and collectible crystals. The gold itself feels near useless. There are only a couple of things worth purchasing in the entire game. Other than necessities, there are a few consumable items like red potions for health, green potions for mana and a feather to return you to the last save point. You can only carry two consumables at a time and often, I'd just forget that I have them.\n\nAs you defeat enemies, you'll earn experience and once you get enough of it, you will level up and earn a skill point. With these points you can assign them to one of five stats: strength, wisdom, agility, vitality and accuracy for an improved chance of critical hits. Each stat can have a level of five with each level unlocking new or improved abilities. Strength is to shoot arrows farther, but at the third level, you can unlock a charge shot. Wisdom says magic orbs might give double the mana, and at the second level, your mana regenerates, level four spells do more damage and at five spells cost half. Agility improves your shooting rate, level four lets you run faster and level five lets you evade projectiles. Vitality says hearts may give double health, the second level takes half damage 15% of the time, at the fourth health regenerates and the fifth lets you take half damage 30% of the time.\n\nWith all the great stuff that's here, the only real issue I have with the game is that it can be cryptic. The townsfolk are no help. Some things are self explanatory, but others such as catching a draft as a whirlwind to launch yourself up took me a few hours to understand that's what I needed to do. I was stuck looking and searching through every secret room looking for a double jump.\n\nThere's often too much locked away from you at once. Since the game is open world, you can enter fifteen different areas, but only get so far in them before you need to head back. If you're stumped, taking a look back through each labyrinth for something you've missed just takes too long. Is that a bad problem to have though? At least the leveling up and experience mechanic meant that every time I explored the same area, I was still being rewarded.\n\nThe only other downside that I can think of is there are no achievements or Steam overlay. Instead there's great music and a charming art style. I'll take the latter over the former.\n\nElliot Quest is a wonderful game that scratches every itch for intelligent gameplay. Its well worth the price of admission, even if its been done in other games, Elliot Quest does it on par with its forefathers and surpasses them.","January 18","true","4.5"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

Thats is Elliot Quest in a nut shell.   This game far surpassed my expectations in terms of how big it is, and how well designed it was as a Metroidvania.   Tons of secrets, optional bosses, and upgrades to find.   The game also has a leveling system that allows you to allocate points into various stats that yield various passive bonuses, although the max level isn't high enough to let you get everything, so decisions need to be made carefully.  Clearing the game and all of its final bosses took me about 20 hours, which is really good for a metroidvania, so good value for your money here.\n\nAs far as negatives go, the in-game options are pretty weak.   There is no way to remap your controls, and the default ones are a little weird using SPACE to jump and D to shoot.   It's not enough to ruin the game or anything, but why wouldn't pick 2 buttons next to each other.   Also there is no explanation for many of the items you find telling you what they are and what they do.  Not a super big deal as many of them are obvious, but some of them have pretty obscure uses that may not be obvious at first,  like using ice to freeze wooden boxes?  Would have liked to see steam achievements as well.\n\nAll of the positives far outweigh the negatives though.   The game is everything you could want in a metroidvania, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes these types of game or any Zelda 2 fan.","January 16, 2015","true","20.7"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

You get an item, what does it do, who knows. You get key item with a message "you got key item X better store this at home", what is this item and where is home who knows. There is no description\flavour text for any item or spell. Hell the game doesn't even tell you what the controls are. Is this fun, not for me it isn't and I'm from the NES era where I grew up playing a ton of jrpgs.\n\nMy second issue is with the experience loss upon death, why is this here anyway. I really wish this MMO mechanic was not implemented as it makes makes levelling up a chore and a grind when you die as you lose huge chunks of XP.\n\nAnother issue I have is the 'pay off' for finding chests. I really dislike that money is all you get from chests, normal chests give you small amount of money, blue chests require a blue key and gives you more money. To me this was extremely unfulfilling as there's nothing really to buy besides a few upgrades and potions.\n\nVerdict:- Did I enjoy my time yes and no. It was fun when it worked like a game, moving from dungeon to dungeon, discovering secrets and beating bosses and not when you're lost and frustrated as to where to proceed next. So who do I recommend this game to, those of you who are into old school games alone but in general I don't see my recommending to anyone else.","December 3, 2014","false","23.1"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/293440/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Elliot Quest is essentially the second Zelda game, on the NES.\nIt feels old, and it's intended. While it does have some more modern features (the checkpoints, for instance), it doesn't really try to do much beyond being a Zelda tribute, and a really hard one at that!\n\nI'll admit that I didn't finish the game, entirely. I beat the main story, but I gave up on the last "end-game" Boss, out of frustration. The pay-off wasn't very alluring either.\nThe problem isn't the Boss itself, but all of the little problems around the game that make big fights a problem.\n\nI won't go into details about most of it, so don't consider a review. These are just some of my thoughts about the game, and one aspect that might make the game worth it, for you.\n\nIf you're looking for that old-school, very hard experience, go for it! Including some of the very cryptic puzzles, and being lost and disorientated for hours.\n\nThe game is somewhat like a metroidvania. You have an overworld separated into areas. Each area, then, is separated into other areas, these being gated by several of the items you will acquire on the adventure. It gets very confusing, because you'll see many "gates" throughout the areas, and when you get the item, you have no idea where the gate was. There are also many gates for little upgrades, to make matters even more confusing.\nNothing too unusual for NES-like games.\n\nAnyway, my problem was mostly the checkpoint system: it doesn't restore your HP fully. Nor your mana. Only half of it. So, if you die in a boss, you'll be handicapped. The only way of getting HP/Mana then is either to kill enemies, or go into a town to buy potions/rest. You can imagine how incredibly frustrating this is. It's a waste of several minutes each time you die, if you want a decent shot at the later bosses!\n\nNot to mention you can only carry 2 potions at any time, and these are not replenishable at checkpoints. So yes, it's a far too punishing checkpoint system for me to bother with that one Boss fight. I endured through all the others, but after 5 bosses, the 6th one was too much. Death from a thousand cuts, I guess.\n\nSo, rant is over. So far, you have my reasons for not enjoying it (well, the ultimate reasons, although there were several little reasons throughout -- old design. I don't like it, but I expected it from this game, so no hard feelings!)\nThe thing that surprised me -- and the reason for me being writting about the game, right now -- was the end-game. Things you can do after you beat the story. Technically, you should do it before, but it's much harder than the final boss, so you might as well...\n\nAnyway, you can collect these little crystals that are very well hidden. Either hidden, or behind a very cryptic puzzle, and mostly isolated (as in, the game doesn't prepare you for those types of puzzles). It's cool. It's supposed to be hard, and the ultimate challenge.\n\nWhat I loved about it, was how "grand" it felt, in a way. I was simply exploring, after collecting some crystals, and saw a door that required crystals to enter (there are many). I entered a completely different area, and discovered even higher upgrades than the ones you encounter through the normal story. Then Bosses! I was pumped.\n\nIt reminds me of the Legendary aspect of Pokemon, where you go into these secluded areas and find ancient monsters to either capture or simply beat.\nPlus hidden stores, etc.\nI wasn't expecting that at all and it seems like something games don't really do much, anymore. PC games, anyway. The whole end-game seems rather lost. The story guides you through all of the upgrades, and after you beat a game, there's isn't anything "bigger" beyond it.\n\nSo yeah, sorry for ruining the surprise! Regardless, if this seems something you enjoy, get the game -- but know what you're getting into.","February 20","true","28.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

It's got beautiful big-pixeled graphics with a soothing earth tone palette.  The music is very nice.  The gameplay follows the framework of its primary inspiration, the unfairly snubbed Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, while outdoing it in nearly every way:  better challenge balance, ten times the enemy diversity, a more sensible level-up system, the list could go on.  The most impressive thing is that though Elliot Quest is astoundingly organic (no copy-paste), the game is very long, with tons of hidden content to uncover (extra bosses, secret items, etc.)\n\nSo taken was I with Elliot Quest that I was on the verge of calling it the next Cave Story -- that is, until I reached the tired, brief, depressing ending.  It made me very sad, because it undercut the rest of the game so much!  And I even got the "good" ending (apparently, it gets worse)!  As fun as the ride was, I will probably never play this again because of the hateful and hackneyed finale.  Childish?  Perhaps, but I believe that an epic fantasy quest calls for an appropriately epic conclusion, and anything less is unacceptable (a SHMUP or an arcade brawler shouldn't have to worry much  about this, obviously, though it should still not end in a needlessly depressing manner).\n\nDumb ending aside, you should get this lovingly handcrafted game when it is on sale; it fills the Adventure of Link niche like no other modern game I've played and we need more like it.","January 14, 2015","true","35.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

The most frustrating feature of this game is the obscurity. Controls are L-shift, S, D, Esc, Enter, Space, and arrows and cannot be changed. They are not explained in the game. The max level is 20 for a total of 19 upgrades. This was not explained beforehand. I could not figure out how to progress at one point until I tried using an item in a slightly different way. And I only just realized what an item I found days ago even does.\n\nBut this is where the lack of explanation in-game enters the gray area of pro/con. To some, it's a barrier. To others, it becomes an invitation to experiment and explore. I was incredibly frustrated while I was stuck, but when I progressed it was extremely satisfying. I've died again and again trying to find out how to even damage some of the later bosses. But slowly learning their weaknesses and taking them down has been incredibly rewarding. The exact order in which to explore the progressively open map is a little foggy, but the overall direction is clear.\n\nExploration is where the game truly shines. Many areas are more accessable than they first seem. Enemies can be tackled with more practice as opposed to more items. Many puzzles are solved not by finding a new upgrade but by creative use of Elliot's existing abilities. There are many side areas with their own rewards, and one or two decisions for Elliot to make that will stay with him for the rest of the game. There are always multiple uses for an upgrade. None of them are spelled out, but some are made clear by the design of the area they are found in. The clever puzzles make yet more applications for Elliot's powers clear.\n\nIn summary, this is a game that is difficult to get into at the start due to the complete, *absolute*, UTTER lack of hand holding.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/293440/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","I can still remember the birthday I got Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. Being a huge fan of the original, I was so excited to dig into the sequel despite knowing nothing about it. For years it was one of my biggest NES disappointments, being too hard and too confusing for my elementary-aged self. I've learned to appreciate it in the intervening years, as well as similar games from the era like Simon's Quest and Journey to Olympus. I only bring this up because Elliot Quest has done an amazing job of refreshing all those memories, good and bad alike.\n\nYou play Elliot, a terminally ill youth on a quest to maybe save himself through divine intervention. There's a pretty rich and developed world to explore that contains four guardians that might have the key to saving Elliot's life, and it's your job to guide him through those forgotten places, and the cliffs and caves that lead to them, mostly unscathed. The world map is huge, with tons of locations of interest, side areas, secret areas, and even enemy encounters.\n\nElliot's default weapon is a bow that fires in an arc, but you gain experience from enemies that can be used to upgrade your attack (and movement and health and magic) that can make it fire faster or straighter. You'll also pick up magic spells, items like bombs and potions, and abilities like double jumps from the many locales you visit. Almost every single area has alternate paths and secrets accessible only with the right powers, so you'll have plenty of reasons to revisit parts of the world.\n\nThere are SO many paths and secrets, in fact, that it can often be hard to tell where you're supposed to go next. My main complaint about Elliot and his Quest is the difficulty, and it's a two-fold issue. The game dumps you in a wide-open world with a fairly clear path to the first temple, but after that there are tons of caves and forts and forests and cliffs that may or may not be the path ahead. You'll need to be very familiar with your abilities to know how to proceed, and many of them are creative enough to make that difficult. Your reward from the first major area, for example, is unlike most powers found in platformers and takes a good bit of experimentation to understand.\n\nEven if you know where you're going, though, there's no guarantee you can get there alive. Elliot Quest can be very difficult at times, with a major spike around the second temple that came as a shock to me. Some enemies are posed in ways that make them almost impossible to avoid, and invincible enemies start appearing with more and more frequency the further in you get. Checkpoints are plentiful but you lose XP every time you die, a particularly brutal punishment considering how challenging some sequences can be. After a few hours my problem wasn't so much where to go, as my options being almost too difficult to face.\n\nIt's pretty remarkable how faithfully Elliot Quest follows in The Adventure of Link's footsteps, down to the confounding levels and difficulty spikes. They're both games that demand a lot of time and attention to appreciate, but are undeniably worth it in the end. Elliot Quest has an absurd amount of secrets and side content to uncover, all presented in charming pixel graphics and pleasing ambiance. If you like your retro platformers challenging and engrossing, you'll get all that and then some here.","February 29","true","2.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Don't make that mistake! This game has lots of secrets and legitimately rewarding side-scrolling exploration (like Zelda II or Metroid) that is all held together by an open, easy-to-navigate world map (like Chrono Trigger's!). Critical items are found in temples, but the real, significant upgrades are nicely tucked away (like how, for instance, Zelda 1's necessary flute item is hidden in a temple you *must* go through but the valuable yet not essential blue ring is under a statue you might never check).

It was just *barely* more fun than frustrating.  That's not something I can feel good about recommending, unfortunately.\n\nOther reviewers have written about it in detail so I'll skip that, and just say that I abandoned it in the endgame, when I realized it was essentially impossible for me to beat the optional secret endgame bosses and get the good ending, because I hadn't maxxed out my magic skill.\n\nThis game is a real shame; if the developers had spent just a liiiiittle more time on it then it could have been an indie classic.","February 22","false","17.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

There was talk of the game being inspired by Zelda II, but sometimes it's just small influences.\n\nThe influence is not small in this one.  It's very much structurally like Zelda II, and a bit of Kid Icarus as well.  Add in a leveling system, and you've got you a nice game here.\n\nGraphically, I liked the look of a lot of the areas.  I wish that it was a little less pixelated, but it all works well in motion.  The soundtrack is heavily inspired by Nintendo classics.  I couldn't help but catch some of the same beats as the Lost Woods and Hyrule Castle from A Link to the Past, Gerudo Valley from Ocarina of Time, and the Palaces in Zelda II.  Truly, the game's inspirations are open.\n\nFittingly, though, there's quite a bit of puzzle solving as well through inventory items acquired throughout the game.  In this way, it takes after Zelda games made after Zelda II.  There's even an item that lets you pull some Mighty Switch Force-style shenanigans.\n\nIt's not all perfect, of course.  If you're going for the "good" alignment, you're going to run into a few bosses that are brutal.  I highly recommend not doing what I did and going critical-heavy, but instead at least maxing out wisdom to get the 1/2 MP cost and double-powered spells.  The bosses that gave me fits would have dropped quickly in the face of that combination.\n\nIt's also not always clear which cliffs you can safely jump off of.  There's a spot between the second and third temples that I got stuck.  Just realize that even if it doesn't look like you have the item to cross a particular area, you can fall down to the bottom and pick up another needed item.\n\nAnother issue is that it saves your progress even after you die.  So if you're taking on a really tough boss, and you use a potion and die, it's going to save that.  It can be frustrating in the more difficult areas...  but again, I think a lot of that is on my build.  It's not impossible by any stretch.\n\nTruly, though, if you want to be entertained by a excellent action-RPG that doesn't crib as much from Metroid as a lot of other modern indies, this is the one to give a shot.  You'll probably get around 25 hours out of it (my total doesn't reflect five hours in offline mode for some reason), and for the price, well, that's hard to beat.

Thheres no tutorial or anything, which isnt necessarily a bad thing, but more intuitivity on thhe map and menu screens could hhelp that out. The game itself is fun, the difficulty is not too bad, but the strong lack of checkpoints is ridiculous. I understand the appeal for perhaps those who wishh to chhallenge themselves, but this is not the 20th century where checkpoints are difficult to work into games for whatever reason, leaving them out does not help an aesthetic it hurts gameplay. The lack of checkpoints can put you back 2 - 3 minutes of gameplay, and up to even 5 if you wish to be thorough like me. And this is only at the beginning of the game, I do not know how much worse it gets late game.

I got this game for free for reviewing purposes\n\nA Spectacular Pixelated metroidvania adventure, If you are into platformers of that type you might be quite interested in this game.\n\nElliot Quest is a really good game that I enjoyed a lot, One of the best features about it is that, It takes a lot of time to complete, And you'd spend a bit more to replay the game and get another ending.\n\nThe level designs are splendid, The graphics and animations are very good, The game music are outstanding .. just outstanding, Reminds me sorta of Alundra+FFV mix.\n\nA new fresh feature that this game has, Is that its both an Rpg in its looks and a platformer, You get inside levels as a 2d platformer, And when exiting the world map it looks like it is in the 4th Screenshot on the steamstore page ( Which is like FinalFantasyV ), Which is really good and has a lot of places and secret areas to discover, And also monsters to encounter which enters you in a small level and fight a few enemies to get gold and what not.\n\nThe game has a lot of monsters, A lot of abilities and stuff to unlock and find and kill, A good set of bosses and levels.\nSeriously there are a LOT of things to discover in this game, The levels are so big.\n\nAnd its a metroidvania so you'd get skills (DoubleJump being an example) And go back to previous parts in the game that you couldn't access before.\n\nWith many places to explore, There are a few villages, In which you can talk to people and buy items and weapons.\nI like the creepy way talking npc's keeps staring at you and following you with their sight.\n\nAnother remarkable part, Is how the game starts with your character being slow, Really slow but as you kill monsters and level up you pick upgrades, Str-Agi-Wis...etc  which can make you either run faster or shoot faster or having better range and a lot more, Gives the game this (progressive) feeling.\n\nA bow is an interesting weapon to have in a game like this, Kinda hoped i'd get something other than it but it develops also so that's nice.\n\nThe game left everything basically "Unknown" Which is for you to figure out, There is no explanation so figure stuff by yourself, Makes it a bit harder and frustrating at parts but not taking it too far.\n\nThere is also the matter of "Choices matter" In the game you get to choose certain things in the story and your actions, Which leads to different endings, Not quite sure how many endings are there really.\n\nSo here is the other Part.\n\nI might made the game seem perfect right now I apologize, Its not.\n\nHere is whats not so good.\n\nFirst : There is the story .... and how the game starts, You start in a level, The left side is an exit to the world map the right side is a forest.\nSo if you go left, You'll find yourself in a huge world map and get so confused on where you're actually supposed to go and question the dev's thinking and why they did this.\nAnd the story, It does not explain to you anything, Just starts with a small line and keeps revealing itself as you go on.\nBut really ? That's not enough, And when you go talk to the villagers you hear them like " Wth are they even talking about and how do they know me", Because you don't even know what you're doing.\nAnd I'm sad to say that the story kinda is vague and dumb until the very end, Finished the game and still have no idea wth just happened exactly.\n\n\nSecond : There is the difficulty, Although this game is quite long and impressive but its really easy.\n( I Don't think this acts as a spoiler ) There is a (ChargeShot) Attack, And let me just say if you use this at a boss it will die from 2 hits, Which is stupid they shouldn't make it possible to hit bosses with it, However the enemy part in the game is thankfully not easy, Just the bosses are really really easy even the last one.\n\nThird : I feel like the game consumes so much of my Cpu, Note that i tried it on my mid-gaming laptop and Pc, And still there was this frame-drop issue at certain levels, While working perfectly at everywhere else on my Pc, There are a few places where it just has to drop to 45-55 ish rate.\n\nFourth : I kinda feel a little bit clunkiness in the game, Like while finishing an action or opening a place, The character takes time to continue moving and to do other actions, And while  pushing rocks, thats when it feels really clunky\n\nFifth : It really sucks that this game has no achievements, Its screaming for it.\nAnd there is also the matter of not being able to take screenshots due to the game not functioning with steam-overlay.\n\nSo to sum it up for light readers.\n\nPros 1 - Amazing level designs and animations.\n2 - Spectacular music and effects.\n3 - Long time to finish and many places to explore.\n4 - Secrets, Monsters, Abilities, Bosses they're all good.\n\nCons 1 - Lack of achievements.\n2 - Feels a bit too easy.\n3 - Steam overlay not functioning.\n4 - Story seems vague and not done right.\n5 - A few frame drops  ( This might not happen to other systems I believe )\n\n\nSo overall.\nA very fun platformer game that is long and beautiful, Similar to good'ol metroidvania games we all love.\nRecommended for those who'd enjoy this type of platformers and wants to spend time on such game.","March 10, 2015","true","9.6"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

In fact the art, code and design for was by one person. Even at 10$ this is a steal and an absolute no brainer. You wont be dissapointed.\n\nOne small gripe of mine would be that it doesnt have steam save so I have to replay the game again if I switch between mac and PC. That is only since I have played a good bunch on the game in alpha. But you know what? that it is still fine.

You start the game with just a weak ranged attack, over the course of the game you can upgrade your gear multiple times and find powerful magic attacks. Like in metroid you often need special items or ability to progress but because the map is just the right size it is easy to find the correct way (sometimes by trial and error). On top of that it controls well (with a keyboard) and has a great soundtrack, the bossfights are excellent and the levels are challenging, you als have an rpg like level system that allows you to customize your skills.\n\nHowever the game is a little rough around the edges:\n-the game has only limited controller support and doesn't accept the analog stick for movement.\n-exploring at the start and finding money chests feels great, but after a while you have so much gold that exploring feels like a waste of time.\n-the game has additonal content that is locked behind doors that only open if you have collected enough crystals, it feels bad to make it through a difficult cave to just end up at something that is a dead end at the moment.\n-the game always auto-saves after a death, that is annoying because if you used potions before your death and couldn't beat the boss you have to go back all the way to the city to buy yellow potions again, that is a huge waste of time.\n-it is possible to enter areas that you can't beat, for example it is possible to enter the "black and white cave" way before you can beat it which leads to an unavoidable death.\n-the first magic upgrade you get blocks every source of damage other than things that insta-kill you, allowing you to "cheat" your way through levels.\n\nConclusion: Elliot Quest is a good game that is worth the asking price, if it was more polished it would be a great game.","January 11","true","13.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Tough yet rewarding gameplay.\nCons: These are not game breakers, rather quips that are worth mentioning: No item explanation, Sometimes it's tough to figure out where to go.  Bombs can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ to get, Level cap, No ability to redistribute skill points\n9/10  Highly recommended!","November 19, 2015","true","22.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Win!\n\nI am really enjoying Elliot's Quest from Ansimuz.\n\nI won't waste time talking about the plot, because I think the real value of this game is in the playing experience.  Elliot's Quest is a fairly straight-forward game where you go around, kill stuff, level up, find new equipment, and find new abilities.  There are two wrinkles, though: 1) the game never tells you where to go or what to do, and 2) there is a fair amount of backtracking to earlier areas to make use of new skills & equipment.\n\nThe actual play is firmly rooted in the old NES game, Zelda II, even down to the little inns where you can refill your health.  HOWEVER, Elliot's Quest has a lot of newer sensibilities, like frequent savepoints, that make the game a joy to play.","December 4, 2014","true","24.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Apart from discovering new areas to explore, it's deeply satifying to find alternate uses and effects for the items/spells you collect. Not just as a puzzle soliving element, but also the way certain spells will completely overpower certain enemy types (fire on a blue slime~).\n\nVisually, it does a great job with pixel graphics. More specifically, it does a fantastic job with colors! The palette range is varied, giving each and every area a unique feel from the others. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any color that isn't used in full array.\n\nThis isn't to say it's without flaws - there's the occasional glitchy moment or questionable game design, and the story is so loosely presented that it feels like nothing more than a means to progress the action.\n\nHowever, these errors are far and few between. At the time of writing, this game is an absolute steal at %50 off. Even at full price, it's more than worth it.\n\nAnd in classic NES fashion. You might want to make notes and sketch out your own map~","December 26, 2015","true","24.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Spending most of my time trying to hunt down the various secrets/powerups I can get to w/ my current kit.\n\nA Fun but Very Hard metroidvaina, which takes a lot of cues primarily from Zelda. LOTS of secrets & powerups to hunt down, although most of the majority of them are just gold drops.\n\nThere is a leveling system, where ea. level you allocate a point to strength (range), wisdom (magic), vitality (health), agility (fire rate/move speed), or accuracy (random crit chance). Game works on a save point system, die or quit & you restart at the last save point you touched. the Savepoints give you a base amount of hearts/mana... and the only drawback to dying is you lose current xp to next level.  Developers obviously expected you to die somewhat frequently, and then retry ala platformers like VVVVVV.\n\nThere is also a morality system, based on a limited set of choices you make thru the game (save this kid, partner with this evil guy, do/don't rob this temple). It's pretty low key though; and you can pretty much ignore it for the most part.\n\nThe game is light on explaining its mechanics, while the basic function of most of the items is pretty straightforward, you'll need to experiment a bit to figure out everything they can do. That could be a plus or a minus, depending on your preference, if you hated Dark Souls cryptic item descriptions, you might hate Elliot Quest's lack of almost any direction too.\n\nGraphics are obvious retro-pixely, but they're clean and attractive looking. Think classic NES style, but with more detail. Music is ok, but not spectacular and the 1st level is a very obvious rip off of a Zelda theme.\n\nBottom line, if you like metroidvanias and don't mind a bit of a challenge, give it a go.","April 12","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're forced to walk way too much even if you don't get lost (which will happen) this is one of those games you wish for a teleport ability that you can use to quickly move to locations already visited, even if you only get it later in the game it would make the game 100x more enjoyable.\n\n3. Bombs, they don't drop from monsters/ objects if you run out of bombs inside dungeons it's a pain in the ♥♥♥ because you have to go back to the town, walk to the shop, buy more bombs, walk back to the dungeon and then you have to remember where the * is the room that had that breakable block/wall.\n\n\nThis isn't an option but consider my recommendation as Neutral.\n","June 2","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
