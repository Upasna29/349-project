The music is good but can seem repetetive.  There doesn't seem to be any voice acting.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lionarith/recommended/382080/","lionarith","[SGN] Lionarith","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lionarith/","384 products in account","So finally i bought this to see what the fuss is all about.\n\nWhat is the game: A simple FPS Shooter in the desert (havent seen the other maps yet). It begins pretty easy but gets tough at the end. But you can add perks with credits and try again.\nThough i am not a fan of the genre, i had pretty much fun shooting the different aliens. After some time there will be waves actively attacking you. And as far as i saw, every wave is different in story mode.\nOf course i wished there were more things to discover, it would add more variety. But the game focuses entirely on shooting and escaping from the desert.\n\nSo, it's as basic as it can get, but with all bugs eliminated after release (no single bug in 2 hours), and an open mind for little mindless games made by one person, and an anti nagging attitude, this one may be not the most creative, but still effective contribution to any games library.\n\nSkip a burger.","May 6","true","2.5"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

Never crashed\n3. In story mode the difficult increases while you advance\n4. Bosses\n5. you are the only dev and this game has alot of things for being made by one person\n6. 2 maps\n7. feels like you are playing in Nintendo 64 and thats nostalgic for me, so i like it\n8. it has few bugs, but what game doesnt have it?\netc etc\n\nCons: If you guys dont buy it, you arnt supporting any kind of games and developers, come on it cost just like 4 USD, you can buy a coke and doritos with that, this guy wants to make games for us so thats admirable.\n\nSurvival multiplayer would be cool, because its hard anyways, and good job man keep going like that and i was reading about the issue with Alien Wasteland so dont worry about that, those douches dont deserve to make games, they are just looking for money.\n\n\nTraduccion...\nOk esta es mi reseña...\n\nPrimero que nada, admiro el que seas el unico desarrollador de este juego, me gustaria  apoyarte por que se que es dificil empezar en el desarrollo de videojuegos, eso es lo que un amante de los juegos hace, asi que para mi, este juego es muy bueno y este es el por que...\n\n1. 60 fps todo el tiempo\n2. Nunca crasheo\n3. En modo historia, la dificultad del juego incrementa conforme avanzas\n4. Jefes\n5. Eres el unico desarrollador y este juego tiene muchas cosas para haber sido hecho por una unica persona\n6. 2 mapas\n7. Se siente como si jugaras Nintendo 64 y eso es nostalgico para mi, asi que eso me gusta\n8. Tiene bugs, pero que juego no los tiene?\netc etc\n\nCons. La unica es si no lo compras, no estas apoyando a los desarrolladores de ningun tipo de juego, vamos, solo cuesta 55 pesos, con eso te compras una coca y doritos todo el tiempo, este hombre quieres hacer juegos para nosotros y eso es admirable.\n\nModo multiplayer para el survival estaria estupendo, por que es dificil jugarlo solo, buen trabajo amigo sigue asi, estuve leyendo un poco el problema que tuviste con Alien Wasteland y te digo que no te preocupes, esos tipos no deberian hacer juegos ya que lo que quieren es solo hacer dinero y buscar a quien joderse.","May 4","true","1.1"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","15","31","0","1"

Broken to the point that sometimes the baseball bat doesn't spawn and the "exit game" function fails to work.\n\nThe Dev, after seeing my review, offered to allow me to test updates - since then physics have improved - though are still hilarious sometimes - and it shows that Devdan really wants to take feedback and improve the game - much better than most roasted devs who blame those who dislike the game for its failings.\n\nThere are moments where the game is actually pretty fun, but needs some more improvements to keep the flow going - as it gets repetitive quickly - until the gigantic alien appears.\n\nGreat work in addressing our concerns.  It's still not game of the year but its nice to see the dev being attentive to our concerns.\n\nThis game is far from perfect - but it's going in the right direction.

(Approximately 100 to 500 game crashes to reach as far as developed by inXile, which is the Hollywood level.)\n* Action Alien / Alien Wasteland: about 1 hour of gameplay, infinitely more fun than I had with the entirety of no-show Wasteland 2 and never-completes-his-game Brian Fargo.\n\nNot great, but not terrible.  There were more than a few moments where I actually struggled against the aliens NPC's like I was battling bots in Unreal Tournament.  Some of the aliens are quite cheesy (cheesy good).  Not something I'd play all the time, but worth the time I put into it (unlike inXile products).\n\nThank you, inXile, for telling me about this game!

I wasn't too sure about it at first - it is a bit rough around the edges, and the single level on offer was a bit uninspiring.  But the game has grown on me. It's had a few updates, with two new levels added. They're an improvement graphically and are a lot more fun to play.\n\nI don't get a lot of time for gaming, and I've found TAW is great to jump into for half an hour of instant action. If you like the look of it then give it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised.
