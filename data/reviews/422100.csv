Yesterday, the game decided one of my lighthouse stations was a controller. This meant I only had access to one controller, and it wasn't the one that would allow me to teleport, so I was stuck in one place.\n\nTried it again today, still only had one controller, but at least I could teleport this time. What I found while moving around was quite a disappointment. Items in the world (like buildings and trees) wouldn't appear until I got close to them, within about 10-15 meters.\n\nFurthermore, I could teleport inside of anything; huge rocks, a bridge, that giant Buddha statue, nothing was solid aside from the ground. I teleported inside of things several times since I couldn't even see them from a distance. Also I'm leaving a trail of rocks everywhere I go, because for some reason the controls to teleport are the same as creating a rock where your controller is located. This eventually started to lag the game as well.\n\nAll in all, this game is poorly made, and it's certainly not even worth it with 20% off of $0.99. This is something that's only worth getting if it was free, unless the developer put in a lot more work to make it polished.","April 24","false","0.1"," 52 of 58 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","52","58","5","1"

The game looks visually pretty bad, the screenshots are a bit misleading. On top of that, most of the static meshes dont appear until you're right in front of them.\n\nThere are sections of the map that involve raised up buildings, however the teleport function doesnt allow you to move along the z axis and as a result you can never go inside them.\n\nRefunding it, even though I only payed $0.80. Not worth anything, get it when its either massively overhauled or just free.","April 27","false","0.2"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

It says to relax, but there's not that much scenery to relax by, and what scenery there is usually doesn't appear until you're right beside it. You can pick up sea shells across the map, but there doesn't seem to be any purpose to doing so. You can spawn rocks to throw, but I don't know how to make a zen garden and just throwing rocks at things doesn't yield much of a result. There are buildings, but you can't go inside them, which made me feel more irritated than relaxed. It's only $1, so I guess I can't expect much, but if I wanted to relax I'd rather just open Tilt Brush or even load up The Gallery and relax popping popcorn by the campfire. It's only $1, but a dollar saved is a dollar saved.","April 29","false","0.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

Getting married to young, having kids to young, deciding making McDonalds my career of choice. Having sex with my cousin, having sex with her mom, having sex with her husband, buying the new Doom.
