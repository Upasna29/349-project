Meet pip, a singular pixel that again shows you should never judge a book by it's cover, or density.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeiwGBlBKPs\nUpon embarking on your journey a ghost appears, an old knight named Sir Elwyn. Knowing Pip is the only character capable of saving the day the knight grants Pip great powers, the ability to tap into the Bit Stream the very lifeblood of the kingdom. Using the Bit Stream Pip is able to evolve into 3 distinct forms, all with there own pros and cons. A singular pixel that can't attack but fits into small spaces, 8bit Pip, able to climb and bounce of vertical walls while moving faster and 16bit pip, full knight with attack moves, sword and shield.\n\nProcess through the game is done on the world map, which consists of 6 zones all with alternate themes. Zones contain 8 levels and finish with a boss fight. Design was intelligent and had plenty of secret stashes and areas to uncover for replayability or 100% runs. First world started off easy don't let that fool you as the difficulty does ramp up, you will soon be swapping between forms multiple times to pass one puzzle or trap. Killing enemies and opening chests during levels will drop gems but to use them will require rescuing of townfolk. Each level contains 3 npcs to find, gradually they will report back for work duties giving you access to new upgrades.\n\nThe pixel art is beautiful and a very nice combination of old and new. Soundtrack could use a little more variation but I think more tracks will come with future updates. Did not attempt to use keyboard and mouse controls but gamepad was tight and responsive.\n\nOverall if you are a fan of games like Kirby and Super Mario Brothers or just looking for a decent sidescrolling platformer with some meat on the bones, this is one early access game worth taking a look at. Successful Kickstarter campaign and content is all in place, just doing some spit shining. Cheers. :)","March 18, 2015","true","3.0"," 46 of 54 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","46","54","3","2"

Each form has its own benefits and drawbacks (as a boxel, Pip is slow, weak, but can float and greatly decrease the speed of his fall), allowing for many variations in gameplay as you evolve and devolve Pip to solve the many puzzles in the game! It's an awesome concept utilized very well in conjunction with the tight controls and varying game mechanics!\n\nThe game may look like your typical x-bit platformer, but the graphics actually combine both classic and modern looks. It results in a very eye-pleasing combination that could only have been made better with some more shaders/particle effects etc.. Jake Kaufman (AKA virt) procures another amazing orchestral soundtrack in this game, with a pretty good variance in soundtrack style throughout the game.\n\nI do wish that there was more of a story. It's definitely more than the generic Mario "save the princess" story, but there are still characters with little backstory! Pip lives in an epic world that deserves more explaination! There's also been some confusing dialogue changes between Early Access and full release that both add to the experience and take away from it due to some dry humor.\n\nOverall, Adventures of Pip is a great twist on the usual platforming fare! Tic Toc Games has recently been pushing the fact that this game's a great introduction to gaming for newer gamers, and I couldn't agree more. It's simple and fun to play, and offers a wide but steady degree of difficulty!","March 17, 2015","true","21.1"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","24","26","3","1"

Great level design in most cases to really take advantage of the player reacting and thinking out the situation they've been put in, and the game has that charm that you'd expect of a game like this, but with a pretty satisfying story even if it's inconsistent. It's not all great, as certain elements of the game do fall flat on their face, and the games difficulty when it comes down to it is very inconsistent. In the end, for the price, it's definitely worth a look when it's on sale, and especially if you want need a platforming experience right now. But strongest element is probably the music, which does well of playing to each level's strength.\n\nFormal Score: 7.5/10\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nEvolution/De-evolution Mechanic works well with all forms of Pip having their own unique strength.\nRewards a player who pays attention and looks for detail, which I really appreciate.\nThe change up in aesthetic between the forms is done well, they all are unique and stand out\nFantastic lineup of music here, which should be familiar to those who've played games like Shovel Knight.\nWorlds feel pretty unique between them in terms of art style. Good design elements here all around.\nControls are exactly what they need to be, and what's even more interesting is that it feels natural to change between forms despite them acting differently in terms of jumping/running, which I wasn't expecting.\n-:\nLength will be an issue for some, even with the collectables.\nCertain levels and bosses don't work in terms of gameplay. In particular, an inconsistent difficulty curve that spikes at times can really lead to frustration.\nOn that note however, most of the game plays rather easily.\nSimilar Games of note:\nBit Evolution\nSuper Win The Game","August 22, 2015","true","6.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","0"

Okay.\n\nThe games entire premise is rather easy to understand. It's a sidescrolling platformer that the hero (Pip) has 3 stages of evolution. Pixel, 8bit and "HiRez" 16bit. Here's what you need to know.\n\nPip can kill special colored enemies to "evolve" and then use that evolution in a time-stop fashion producing an AOE Attack and devolving Pip in the process.\nPixel Form: Slow. Can Float by holding jump. Light Weight.\n8b Form: Fast Runner, Wall Jump, Wall Cling, Swimming, Punching\nHiRez: Slow, Heavy, Swings a Sword, Can Push Objects\n\nMinor Grievances: I'm unsure if this was intentional, but you can punch Sword Blocks in 8b Form.. becaauuuuse reasons.\n\nNeedless to say. I spent most of my time in the 8b form. Navigation, Ease of Evo swaps, Speed and the obvious No need for Swords ever due to the 8b oddity.\n\nWith that out of the way, lets get into the gameplay. The level design of the game seems to be split into very limited segments with an evomob casually lined up for navigating how you'll proceed. It was simple. I guess it was built this way too make the experience feel "seamless" but in the end came out a little flat. Also, almost every secret in the game is pretty obvious with a small hole in any wall telling you "Hey im here". There's so many puzzle aspects to this game they could have run on and didn't. It made me feel a bit cheated. However, the Lava and Castle World were fun.\n\nI don't even want to really touch on the scripting. It was.. special.\n\nIf you're familiar with Platformer games at all. There's nothing new or special here for the average gamer. I put the controller down after about 3 hours of gameplay *and* 100% Completion thinking that there was not very much in the terms of replayability or anything that would encapsulate a memorable experience.\n\nAll in all. It's a game. If you've read this far and still want to buy the game - just wait for it to be on sale.","July 8, 2015","true","5.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

Avoiding spikes, reaching seemingly impossible platforms through trial and error, hunting down the hidden villagers and defeating HUGE bosses.\nWith basic pixel form and two evolved states, some of the rooms can prove to be most challenging.\n\nThe controls are tight and responsive and the sound track adds tension.\nIf you like platforming games with a challenge then you can do far worse than play Adventures Of Pip.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zikAOKypyxM","August 23, 2015","true","2.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

From the moment I saw the trailer to this game, I knew I had to play it and now after having completed it, I am not disappointed.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/0JY_gPzOAS0\n\nThe visual presentation is wonderful and really effective; the single pixels to the 32 bit characters all have endearing qualities and help to shape this caste driven world into an effective setting for Pip's adventure.  Now, this may not be the most original game ever made but it is a throwback to the classic platform games of old, borrowing and building upon the classic mechanics that we all know and love.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/marioysikax/recommended/303550/","marioysikax","Hyper Mairo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/marioysikax/","994 products in account","First of all, I did back this game up in kickstarter, because I heard the words Wayforward and Jake Kaufman. Also I didn't play the game trought because I got bored.\n\nSo this game can be put into two simple words: unpolished and easy.\n\nSo the unpolished part crawls back all the time. First when you start the game, you are greeted with Unity launcher, with only single graphical option and input tab with unused placeholders. So instead of having resolution and windowed options inside the game like they usually are, they broke full controller support and used generic Unity launcher instead like in some 1€ title. When you actually get into actual game and go back to your sofa after getting up to press enter key on the keyboard, you see that all the menus have really weird font choise on them with aliased prompts made with ms paint (being pixel game is no excuse, you can have pixelated icons, but having HD looking icons that are aliased and also seems to be upscaled).\n\nSo up to this point I have been complaining about menus, but when you got into the game, it starts allright but you start to feel like something isn't right. One thing I did notice that even though music is fine (even that loops oddly and all the time ugh), everything else in the sound department sounds lacking and like nothing you do feels like it has any kind of impact, which gives this "meh" overall feeling. That combined that game starts really really slowly and still is pretty easy to crasp (run, jump, attack and change form, not much) and overall it's pretty easy game to play. It gives feeling that there has to be something more to it, but there simply isn't. It basically becomes walk in the park where you start to think that you could spend you time on something better.\n\nI guess biggest problem is that "meh" factor, had the same problem with Gunman Clive and many people seemed to love that game. Gameplay itself is solid, so it's playable for sure so if you want really easy platformer then there's no issue there. However I'm sure there's alternatives that cost less than 15€ price tag with this.\n\nAlso character/camera seems to be locked at 40 FPS which gives this bad stuttering with 144Hz display and Dualshock 4 doesn't have pause menu button at all so those are factors as well.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIhan ensimmäiseksi, annoin rahaa tälle pelille jo kickstarterissa koska kuulin taikasanat Wayforwards ja Jake Kaufman. En myöskään ole pelannut peliä läpi asti koska kyllästyin.\n\nPelin voi tiivistää kahteen simppeliin sanaan: kiillottamaton ja helppo.\n\nKiillottamaton kohta palaa koko aika mieleen. Kun peliä avaa ensimmäistä kertaa, ruutuun pompahtaa Unityn käynnistin, missä on ainoastaan yksi graafinen asetus valittavana ja näppäintabi on täynnä käyttämättömiä paikanpitäjiä. Eli sen sijaan että resoluutio- ja ikkunavalinnat oltaisiin heitetty pelin sisälle valikkoon niinkuin yleensä on tapana, niin täysi ohjaintuki on rikottu ja käytetään geneeristä Unityn käynnistintä sen sijaan niinkuin euron tuotoksessa. Kun ollaan vihtoin päästy itse peliin ja takaisin sohvalle sen jälkeen kun on pitänyt käydä tietokoneella painamassa enteriä näppäimsistössä, näkyy kuinka valikoissa on käytetty hyvin outoa fonttivalintaa ja kaikki valikot on hyvin aliasoituja ja näyttävät ms paintilla tehdyiltä (pikselipelinä oleminen ei ole tekosyy, ihan hyvin voi olla pikselöidyt ikonit, mutta kun kaikki näyttää HD:ltä mutta aliasoituna ja upskeilatulta).\n\nTähän asti olen valittanut vasta valikoista, mutta kun päästään siihen itse peliin, niin kaikki alkaa ihan OK näköiseltä, mutta pikkuhiljaa alkaa tuntua että kaikki ei nyt ole ihan kohdallaan. Yksi juttu mitä huomasin että vaikka musiikki oli ihan hyvää (vaikkakin looppaa oudosti ja koko aika...), kaikki muu ääniosastolla kuulostaa hieman vajaavaiselta ja ihan kuin teki mitä tahansa niin sillä ei ole kauhean suurta vaikutusta, joka johtaa sellaiseen "meh" fiilikseen. Se yhdistettynä siihen kuinka peli alkaa hyvin hitaasti ja on kuitenkin erittäin helppo hallita (juoksu, hyppy, hyökkäys ja muodonmuutos, ei paljoa) ja peli on kaiken kaikkiaan hyvin helppo. Se tuo sellaisen tunteen kuinka siinä pitäisi olla jotain enemmänkin, mutta kun ei ole. Siitä tulee kävelylenkki jossa alkaa ajatella kuinka aikansa voisi tuhlata paremminkin.\n\nVarmaankin se "meh" tekijä on se isoin juttu, minulla oli sama ongelma Gunman Cliven kanssa mutta silti moni tuntui rakastavan sitä. Pelimekaniikka on kohtalaisen vankka ja pelattavuudessa itsessään ei ole valittamista joten jos etsii helppoa tasoloikkaa niin pelissä ei ole sen kummempia ongelmia.

As you progress the game to save a princess from an evil queen you must evolve and devolve through 8-Bit and 32-bit incarnations of yourself. Each “form” grants you different abilities meaning you must use different forms to navigate your way across the game's many worlds and levels.\n\n1 pixel Pip can bounce higher and glide down onto enemies and platforms, 8-bit Pip can wall-jump, grab ledges and punch and full 32-bit Pip gains a sword and can smash up blocks and platforms. Using all of these 3 forms together, sometimes evolving and devolving mid jump, lets you navigate the game’s increasingly complex levels.\n\nThe bosses in the game are excellent and really drew me in. The game itself Is not an easy one to best and often I found myself dying many times before completing a level but I always felt that the game was fair and it kept me coming back for more.\n\nIn between levels you can go to town and buy a number of upgrade items such as more hearts, better weapons and 1 use items to make the game easier or more enjoyable. All of these are paid for with in game currency and there is no in game freemium crap in sight. The issue however is the games economy is out of balance and earning enough money to afford most of this stuff takes far too long and even then the items are hardly game changing.\n\nThere are also 3 villagers to save in every level which seems to be there for achievement hunter as while I was progressing through the game I did lose a little bit of interest in finding them.\n\nAs you progress a little bit of boredom and repetition does set in and sometimes I felt a few less levels in each world actually would have improved the pacing of the game. Overall the game took me about 6 hours to complete but I did kind of feel that a cheaper and more condensed experience would have been a better game overall. An alternative solution would have been to have had a few more styles of sprites to evolve and devolve into.\n\nOverall “The Adventures of Pip” is a fun little game which I feel would be perfect for a handheld such as the Vita. If you find it on sale I would say go for it but at full price there is not quite enough on offer to make it and essential purchase.\n\n*Please note a copy of this game was provided by the publisher for review purposes*\n\nFor our full video review please visit our site below\n\nhttp://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-grades/150602_game-tutor-grades-adventures-pip-final-release","June 2, 2015","true","8.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Now, 2 years later, I bought it when I saw it on sale. It is a good game, despite it not being what I expected.\nIt takes a lot of themes from Mario (saving the princess, map layouts, etc) but it improves on almost everything, including the difficulty. You will find yourself staring at the level sometimes trying to formulate some way out.There are also a few texture glitches and the like but nothing that will prevent you from playing levels.\nIt is hard for me to recommend this at $15, because there ARE better $15 games out there, but I would definitely recommend getting this when it is on sale for 10 dollars or less.","May 10","true","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

No game should ever use generic fonts such as Helvetica or Arial (and this is all over the place), and there is a serious, disturbing lack of sound for some character actions, especially bosses. For example the second boss goes through a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of transformations, is full of spikes, rolls around the screen, is all over the place and is nearly silent. That kills the mood and makes it feel like a beta. No amount of Jake Kaufman's soundtrack is going to compensate for that lack of sound design.","July 18, 2015","false","3.1"," 25 of 51 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","25","51","0","0"

The mechanic of changing between the forms for certain segments is not too bothersome as there's always a way to advance back up a stage if you mess up the puzzle/jump/etc. I mostly stayed in the second form due to its speed and wall-jump. Also, I noticed there weren't many times I needed to be in the sword form. And after picking up a certain upgrade, I only needed the sword form to hit bombs and push around blocks.\n\nFor the price I paid, this game gave me plenty of enjoyment and recommend it to fans of platformers that aren't looking for too much of a challenge while still wanting a fun time.","March 10","true","7.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

To begin with they released Early Access to the public and not backers which met with some mixed responses from upset former supporters and others defending the decision.\nThat is just some background info for those who didn't know. Now on to the game!\n\nIt is not fun.\nThe gameplay is the most generic simple platforming possible, and amazingly feels both clunky and slidey. Jumps, walljumps, punching. That's it.\nThe music sounds like royalty free instrumental garbage with no atmosphere.\nIn various locations are the "secrets" - seemingly solid walls that you walk through. Revolutionary.\nLittered around the levels are treasure chests filled to the brim with a colourful currency that has no real practical application. You can buy a heart container or potion but the levels are so coma-inducingly easy that there is no reason to do so.\nThere are also 3 hidden people to rescue in each stage. This seems to do nothing at all as far as I can tell and just serves as pointless busywork in lieu of any variety.\n\nThis is based off the first 10 levels or so which should be long enough, in my opinion, for a game to start showing off what it excels at.","May 16, 2015","false","1.4"," 27 of 61 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","27","61","0","6"

I'm a slow gamer, but 7-8 hours is the maximum amount you would need to complete it.\n\nI have enjoyed the silly story and the humourous characters. The main character is mute à la Link though. Don't expect mindblowing scenarios and conversations.\n\nI believe the multi-scaling ability system worked out quite well. The game itself is quite straightforward. That is why the difficulty is decent ; probably even too easy for any veterans.\nThe game offers several upgrades throughout the game, but they have little to no impact on the gameplay. That is quite a shame.\n\nThere is no incentive to re-play the game. You might only end up completing again some levels where you haven't found the '3 secret characters' (obtainable in every level). This isn't necessary if you are not aiming for 100% though.\n\nThe reviews here have mixed feelings about the game sound. I'd say the music background is nice, but it's true that sound effects are lacking in general.\n\nOne thing to note is that the game UI is not very user-friendly. If you check the controls menu, you'll be very confused. The game explains you progressively which buttons are actually useful though.","March 12","true","10.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Armed with the ability to switch between pixel, 8 bit, and 16 bit forms, Pip must make his way through a world of peril to save the princess and restore order.\n\nAt heart, the game itself has a cute and consistent art style, good music, tight controls, and an interesting premise. While all of these qualities work wonderously, the game becomes rather tedious in it's later half due to both the  primary mechanic of form switching and saving the villagers. Form switching  is presented far too quickly without much buildup, leading to a rather lackluster experience without much surprise or intrigue. While each form provides their own functions, more abilities for each or perhaps multiple ways to tackle a level would have broken things up in a more interesting way. As for the villagers, there's not much incentive to rescue them as they themselves, or any items or upgrades(in the case of the vendor and blacksmith respectively) are not required to complete the game. Furthermore, upon completing the game there aren't any objectives or bonuses aside from the ones presented in the main game(finding villagers)\n\nAt the end of the day, AoP has a lot of unique ideas going for it that will hopefully be expanded upon in a possible sequel. While far from perfect, if you're a fan of pixelated platformers and  have a few hours to spare, you may very well enjoy it.","May 10","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
