The game's got acceptable graphics for what it is.  But, it has enough gameplay issues that I just can't recommend it.  To wit:\n\n- This is supposedly a Hidden Object Game (HOG).   In a HOG, the non-HOG puzzles should be perception-based with some mild logic puzzles of putting together the pieces you have.  There are certainly HOGs in this game.  But, in general, the non-HOG puzzles are mostly what appear to be heavy logic puzzles.  In reality, they're really just brute force puzzles.  With a logic puzzle, you examine the situation, figure out the rules, and determine that the answer is X.  In these brute force puzzles, you can't do that.  The best you can do is look at the situation, figure out the rules, and optimize your moves to try to minimize the combinations you have to try before stumbling upon the answer that works.  Very frustrating in a HOG-type game.\n\n- The game will randomly re-activate HOGs you've already done, but give you no game-based reason to go back to that area and see that a HOG has re-activated.  The only way you figure it out is when you're stuck and either look at the map to see an old area now has something for you to do there, or wander back through all the accessible areas to see.\n\n- The story is even more filled with holes than the story in other HOGs.\n\nYes.  I got about 8 hours of play out of the game.  But, the game is just not good enough to recommend.  I suppose if you can find it for a couple of dollars or in a heavily discounted bundle, you could try it.  Just be aware of the situation.","July 5, 2015","false","10.3"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

There is a variety of puzzles and Hidden Object parts so the game keeps moving at a nice pace like a book its a good page turner.  Some of the puzzles take ALOT of time to solve and many are very, very, very, difficult.  These difficult games can just be skipped, there are hints if you get stuck, and a guide.  A good game that you can stop playing anytime and come back to since the map screen has exclamation marks showing which areas have something to investigate.\n\nThe visual look of the game is impressive, the scenes never feel dead, their alive with animals moving, instead of just a static image like other games.

Fortunately this game has nothing to do with the 'Maltese Falcon' or 'The Shadow' beyond that "noire" flare.  Takes place in the late 1800's, I estimate, from the crazy inventions and steam powered "science" which inspires today's steam punk.  (I really love the elevator.) Action/adventure/mystery all rolled into one.  Damsel in distress, rescue her father, stop the crazy "mad" scientist and save the world, what more could one ask for?\n\nWell executed linear storyline with just a place or two that feels "padded".  Mostly point and click, but enough hidden object scenes to still be an actual hidden object game.  Puzzles of various types and not all of them in the neat little game puzzle boxes.  Some of the more puzzling aspects of this game is simply trying to figure out how to do something, or just where an item is.  I must point out that I really liked the fact that if the player thinks they need a screwdriver, they really do need a screwdriver and not a coin or bobby pin or some other obsure, does not quite make sense item to solve something.  It simply becomes a matter of where is the screwdriver.  As far as actual designated puzzles I only remember one as being a down right frustration.  Since there is no penalty for skipping a single puzzle, I skipped after about 10 minutes of game time.  After I skipped I remembered there was a walkthrough and I could have looked up the solution. C'est la vive.\n\nI hope this becomes a series because I really like the character Alex Hunter.  He reminds me of Humphrey Bogart for some reason, that cynical, rather jaded overlook on life probably, or could just be the voice acting in the introduction.  Regardless I really would like to go through those previous cases involving fraud, theft, bribery, and murder.  Sounds like a good adventure to me.\n\nThis game has those hidden/ghost/shape shifting objects so do not miss them, since the previous chapters lock so there is no going back.  There is a bonus chapter after finishing the main storyline, in game achievements, and accesible extras (wallpapers, production sketches).  Steam also has achievements and trading cards.\n\nAll in all an excellent game, and I personally like the pregame music.","August 10, 2015","true","13.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It had the good HINTs/STRATEGY GUIDE (bundled).  It had a MAP feature to speed travel and show you were the next actionable locations were.  It had the JOURNAL system that auto recorded all the clues you had seen elsewhere in the game.  It had BONUS CONTENT (i.e. "Secret Room", Wallpapers, Audio Tracks) which unlocked when you found enough of the secret mysterious symbols throughout the game.  It had a reasonable plot (for a Hidden Objs genre game), good atmosphere/feel, and the Hidden Objects puzzles threw a few Aha moments at me.\n\nHowever, it felt like just before it hit excellence in most of those areas, it would fall slightly short, again and again.  It had a LOT of sliding piece puzzles, which I find personally annoying.  The plot didn't go far enough for me to get personally invested in it.  The arcade puzzles were interesting, but sloppily implimented ... so I'd have to replay because it was sometimes scoring hits as misses (shooting gallery), etc.  Overall it felt like things were being added from a master "to do list" of what games should have, instead of being organically grown out of the game itself.\n\nMissing/Broken Feature(s):\n* Achievements in Game (But no Steam Achievements)\n* I wish it had Steam collectible Cards, too.\n* Soundtracks in Extra Content section:  Only 1 of the tracks would play music (with LONG delay)\n\nOverall Rating:  4/5 Stars (even with all the bonus features)","September 24, 2014","true","10.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It certainly took me longer to finish than any of the Midnight Mysteries, Samantha Swift, or Clockwork Man games. My only caveat is that I'm not personally a huge fan of sliding tile puzzles and this game has several - some of which I managed to solve on my own and some of which I used the in-game hint book or the Skip button to pass. But if you like that sort of thing and like finding hidden objects and solving point-and-click puzzles, then this game is for you, especially if it's on sale.

Some of the puzzles I just could not figure out and finally gave up and skipped it. I went back and played it again and was able to figure out a couple more. In order to not use the map to figure out what you need to do next, you have to really remember every place you've been. What is really nice is the bonus chapter is as involved as the regular game. It takes quite a bit of time to solve the bonus chapter; not a quick run through like some other games. If you play the game in the expert mode, you have to really search for all the secret signs in order to unlock the secret chamber. I've played it twice, once on regular mode and once in expert mode. I could not find all the signs in expert mode so couldn't unlock the secret room. I would hghly recommend this game. It is challenging.

Although it never really surpasses the mediocre level, the sheer length alone makes it stand out of similar games.\n\nLong version:Alex Hunter: Lord of the Mind is an average hidden object title in all aspects, except one: unlike most similar games it has a male protagonist.\nNot that it really matters, since the story– a missing person investigation leading into a James Bond-like “stop the evil genius from taking over the world” scenario– takes up about 5-10 minutes of game time. It is nothing more than an excuse to use a Victorian visual theme, a very carefully designed and implemented, excellent visual theme.\n\nThe game is exceptionally long, thanks to the quite lengthy (although not particularly difficult) puzzles, the balanced hidden object scenes, and just the sheer number of places you can visit. It can easily clock over six hours even if one uses the map all the time to avoid the constant backtracking, making it an excellent choice if you want to have some game length for your money.","December 24, 2014","true","6.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I play these sorts of games for the puzzles and consider the hidden object and inventory management as parts I just have to suffer through to get to the puzzles.  There is a fair variety in the types of puzzles, from jigsaw to sliders to logic, but some of them are less about thinking and more about making you try all the combinations until it works.\n\nThere will be several rooms open at any given time and you will have to keep going between them to complete the objectives.  At first this was very confusing because there might be 10 things in the rooms that you need to do and you might have 10 things in your inventory, but none of those objects helps with the immediate tasks.  There is little to no direction in the "story" to tell you what you should be working on solving next and which things you don't have the objects for yet.  Then, I realized the map always shows which rooms have activities that can be completed.  It's a cop-out to use the map like this instead of having a better written game where it would make sense what you are supposed to do next.\n\nAlong with not knowing what to do next, quite often a hidden object scene that you had previously completed will re-activate and have new things for you to find.  However, the game does not indicate in any way, except for the map, that you need to backtrack to that area.\n\nIf you can get it on sale, it can be some fun for the puzzles, but overall it is a poorly done game.\n","January 4, 2015","false","15.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Like other alawar games, the environments and details are beatiful, and this one has noticeably more animated features in the hidden object parts as well as the backgrounds, making it more immersive than the others I've played. Story took around 3 hours to complete with minimal hint use in expert mode, could be done faster if you use the map shortcut thing but I didn't bother with it. Also seems to include a guide of exactly everything you need to do, on top of the hints, and where all the secret symbols are located and their exact map locations, simply by clicking a journal page, which seems like too much hand-holding. My only real complaint is how easy the hidden object parts were, Everything's so obvious, even with multi-part objects, that it's just tedious clicking of listed things. I started hating seeing the sparkles that indicated a hidden object section because it was just a time-waster with no challenge, I knew the part I was going to get from completion and how I was going to use it, and only maybe 1  of the 15 or so objects wasn't just staring you in the face.

Like the rest of the genre, it was clearly designed with the tablet gamer in mind, but plays fine on PC.  It features a lot of running back and forth taking various plot coupons to their destinations, but that element can be made easy (if you choose) by use of an in-game map that helpfully flags every area where you could currently do something useful.\n\nThe "hint" mechanic can be used to point out a hidden object, skip a puzzle, or direct you to a place of potential action, so you'll never be stymied for too long, if you're willing to use hints.  Your difficulty setting determines whether the hint recharges quickly or slowly.\n\nWhile not particularly inventive, this game is a solid and well-made example of its kind.  I got several hours of enjoyment, and have no regrets about it.","June 23, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sadly this is one of the few HOG games I have every given a thumbs down. I find a lot wrong with this game and they annoy me to no end. The worst offender was a chalkboard puzzle that the game refused to auto solve for me. Grrrrr really?? Click on the hint button and it tells you to look in the journal and I just never did get the crummy drawing. I had to go to youtube and see how exactly they wanted me to connect the dots.\n\nTheir is a walkthru for the game that is contained on the two feet in the lower right hand corner. I found it by accident another annoyance. The timer is sllllloooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww its just slow. I just didnt care for this game. The story didnt grab me. Some women comes in and your off to solve the case.\n\nThe graphics while they look good they never did draw me in to want to play more of this world they created.\n\nThe problem is that the bar is set very high for these types of games. This one just feels very lazy compared to other games that I have played. House of 1000 doors is a lot better and has a better story to boot. Nearwood is another great game.\n\nI am skipping this one. Just cannot be bothered. Feels like work instead of fun. Spend your hard earned dollars on some other more deserving hog.
