I can honestly say that the pricing wasn't my only issue with the game when reviewing it the first time. The way the game played, lack of customization, never running into people who spoke the same language, and the fact the game resembled that of a mobile port were also problems for me.\n-With that being said, I haven't played since my original review and will update this after I get the chance to play again.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nOLD REVIEW\n\n15$?

Is this a first person shooter or a space mmo??  Pick sniper, trooper, medic or tank.  I would have preferred you can pick your spaceship and customize with modules instead.\nYou jump into the game and have the music blaring in your ear, should have the settings before you do that.  No way to change it before hand.\nStep 2 create a companion??  well guess what the tutorial does not really do anything to help you out with that.  If you have not played Eve online you don't even have any idea it wants you to make a drone.  So lucky for me I have and go to the cargo bay and make a drone using a kit.\nStep 3 fly to space.\nOkay I guess I don't really have any say in my ship or what it does or what weapons I have or cargo or nothing.\nFind the action option menu and fly into space and crash to destop.\nThe game crashes so hard it locks up my pc and I need to do a hard reboot.\nTry again, this time I have the tutorial tell me to rotate the camera, no instructions, no key binding nothing.  Lucky for me I have played Eve online so I manage to do that.  Then the game crashes again.  Crashes so hard again I need to do a hard reboot.\n\nUnistall game, hope they do not close the server since they can not even afford to keep the game up and running while under development.\n\nGame has potential if they work on it and get people to give them money for this.\nSince I can not even fly in space yet they won't be getting any money from me.","April 24","false","0.4"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","41","46","5","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mr_X1/recommended/368750/","Mr_X1","Mr. X","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mr_X1/","863 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n(Disclaimer - Game was originally won via Steamgifts from before the game went F2P)\n\n-Poor account security. Passwords aren't encrypted in the games servers, and a recovery request gets them sent back to you in plain text. By far, this is the weakest form of account security that a multiplayer-mmo could have. (Update - SS of what you get when you put in a recovery request. No confirmation required, not even a simple security question. Just them pulling user info from what is, from the devs own admission a unencrypted user database and sending it right out - http://i.imgur.com/C9U2Rdq.png )\n\n-Smatterings of untranslated text. The account recovery screen for one has been left in Russian, while most other account pages have been translated.\n\n-Race selection. One of the race descriptions completely overshot the description screen. so you're unable to read a segment of it.\n\n-Ship selection. The ship selection screen has a section where you can see your ship, yet quite a few ships clip through the screen. That said, the ships themselves are beautifully designed, as are the character cards. That said, the ship descriptions are spotty, having been translated to English but not properly localized. (Case in point, housing durability? What? Oh, HULL durability.)\n\n-Micro-transactions. This game has em, despite the games kickstarter and official reviews saying that the game wouldn't have em.\n\n-Extremely, EXTREMELY, variable pricing. The game launched at $5, a month ago with a small discount to 4.49. The games price was then jacked up to $10 on the 18th - Two weeks after launching. The game was then dropped down to $5 two days later on the 20th. And THEN (Yes, it continues...) the games price was set to $1 (Note - The game DIDN'T get a discount set, the games base price itself was lowered) on the 28th. (See last point for another bit about 'variable pricing'\n\nAnd now we come to this month. The games price was jacked up to $15 on the 2nd. (Price history available here - https://steamdb.info/app/368750/)\n\nAlso, see my disclaimer? About getting this at Steamgifts? Yeah. The dev has been putting up quite a few copies - my guess, in hopes of getting positive reviews and to try and get more players - of this game their in recent weeks. (Just today he'd put up 129 copies)\n\nSpeaking of players, the game had lost quite a few of them which is what lead to the giveaway flood. The game topped out at 3600 owners on the 2nd, and by the 8th the owner count fell down to 2460 (Losing almost 1200 owners). Oddly enough, that tanking happened right after the games base price rose from $1 to $15, so I guess many people thought something looked very off about that drastic a price jump. (Owner stats available here - https://steamdb.info/app/368750/graphs/)\n\n-Incoming bundle flood. The Dev stated that 25k keys were given out to various bundlers and game websites. One month after release, and everyone and their grandmother will be bundling it.\n\nUPD - Flood is mostly over, for what good it did. Stillborn from the start, the game topped out at 19 players in the past week. The dev was a bit quick to make such a big deal about the game hitting just under 1k players after their little bundle flood, since he'd confused card idlers with actual players.\n\n-Extremely overstating given reviews. From what the dev said about the PCGamer review, you'd THINK that they called this one of the 'best games in 2016'... But they didn't.\n\n-Available for Free elsewhere. Yeah. Facebook and Android.\n\nHonestly? Just wait for the bundles to be released. Or take advantage of one of the free EA versions.\n\nAnd after 'consulting the fans', the game has went F2P. I don't see why the Devs are making such a big hoopla about going F2P when the game was advertised as a F2P game in the first place. I guess you could tack this on under the variable pricing as well.\n\n...Speaking of the F2P update, this doesn't exactly bode well for the 'cash shop' that many of this games official reviews say the game doesn't have. Supposed to have been removed two updates ago, as STATED by the dev, all we've gotten since then was a mention that it'll be 'updated next patch' and that next patch has just come out with... no mention of it, at all.","February 10","false","0.7"," 61 of 83 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","61","83","3","15"

If this Genre of game interests you then please take the time to read this review.\n\nThe short of it.\n\nThis game has come to PC and other platforms from facebook and "app status" - it is being remodelled and improved for us as we speak and has enormous potential to steal you away from reality.\n\n- 3 Races to choose from. Humans, Borguzands and Kriptizids.\n\n- A Variety of classes / ship types to pilot, each with their own unique abilities. Sniper, Tank, Engineer and Trooper\n\n- A shared bank facility for your characters, even across races.\n\n- An auction house for the budding traders amongst us.\n\n- Crafting of modules for your ship with randomized stats and bonus abilities providing you with an almost unlimited number of builds to aim towards and test at your leisure.\n\n- Mining either with your ship, up close and personal with the asteroids to collect ores or by placing Mining stations in the contested sectors to collect nebula elements for your passive skills.\n\n- PVP / PVE yes this game is not always safe, if you're a desk flipper / screen thrower you may wish to bring teddy along for some much needed cuddles.\n\n- Real time combat with players.\n\n- Form a Coalition amongst the players in your Race and strive towards gathering enough votes to become the Leader of your Race !\n\n- Leveling from 1-30 in however you choose. PVP / PVE ( currently no Quests - work in progress )\n\n- lvl 20+ a daily instance will be available for you and your Coalition friends to combat waves of AI ships your own level to receive items, experience and credits based on how long you can survive ! ( Instance is a work in progress )\n\nWhen / If you purchase and download this game strap yourself in, grab your snacks and a beverage of your choice, you wont be moving from that chair for quite some time. ^_^\n\nClearly I am excited about this Indy title and I hope some of you folks out there get on board and give this Early Access game a try.

(Not really a con since the devs need to make money from somewhere).\nDidn't meet any other player (seems like not many are playing this as of yet).\n\nThis game really has potential but is not finding it as of yet, with time and the if improvements are added by the devs in the future, this game will be a really good game.","March 4","true","1.0"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","25","37","2","1"

The ship flight controls were designed for a two button controller with a joy stick but there is no joy.  You have NO true control over your ship especially considering all that could be done with keyboard controls.   It is more like hurling a rock in space than navigating a vehicle.   The dashboard of information about your ship, your speed, your enemy, other target is very simple and updates come very, very slow.  Immediate game feedback is an absolute and this game has none.  Lag was built into the game and we all hate lag.

The first minute of game time doesn't capture the pain of creating an account with no visible cursor, entry field or tab control to guide its completion. Once created (like working in brail) and logged in, the sound cut in to assail the eardrums and a static screen materialised but failed to progress into movement of a game, just 2.3gb of space I was going to leave for sometime before trying again. However, curiosity got the better of me and I tried again until I got it working ...hmmm think I found out what killed the cat. Still, I stuck it out for 3 hours to poke around  but it currently has too many Cons for me to recommend just yet.\nCons.\nMajor action is performed by way of mouse controlled clicks on a series of icons that form a large and restrictive overlay down the left hand side of the screen: icons include one for weapons fire and 2 for ship speeds, which if your used to simultanous play of left click and WASZ motion are very stilted/don't flow. The overlay also renders part of the screen unusable for  other controls like identification by click of ships or structures that pass underneath and changes of camera angle by mouse rotation and I could not reduce it because this drives the game. The method of control clearly does not allow personalisation of key binding as there is none!.\nOther actions use a drop down menu that was hit and miss to trigger and really only worked in my home galaxy. So things like triggering the map to find a way back ,  locate items or check ships hold were none existnant anywhere else.\n\nThere is also very little guidance on basic operations or strategies of the game and what help there is consisted of a newby tab that when active presents a series of prompt orientationed tasks so out of step with learning they just don't match requirements for teaching and you must complete these task in turn to move them on. There are also comments about controlling  passive skills and getting close to planet surfaces, but I just could not get close to any planet I just passed through them and nothing triggered.\n\nIt is surposed to be MMO and one of the newby tasks tells you to form a group but I just could not get the drop down menu to appear  to allow this to be done and could not progress any further on the help tasks as a result.\n\nMixed:\n\nYes, it look like its wriiten in Russian and some of wording is in an odd pidgeon but it can be followed.\nThe graphic aren't brilliant but its in alpha afterall.\nThe map suggests there could be a significant number of systems and planets to explore but I  found the current game play available to me somewhat repetative.\n\nPro:\nHaving the choice of 3 factions that control various sectors of space, with base turrets and stations suggests that with development, more people and a better understaning of what to do the game may actually contain elements of strategy and co-op that could be something far better than I found. I just could not find any clear narrative to gave a good insight into these matters, but i did enjoy being attacked while completing boring hunter gather tasks albeit that I had basic skills and little instruction.\n\nSummary: Overall although I will not delete it from my system just yet, I would not have spent the time and effort to download, create a login id and play had I known just what it was like at this time. It is someway behind fractured space, the other Alpha space game I have on steam, but there may be added dimensions to this game in time that I am currently missing, we will see\n\nUpdate 1:  Must at least have something going for it as I have come back today to have another look today despite saying I'd leave it a while. I have now managed to find a discussion thread about 2 keys, W is for forward when pressed once and pressed a second time for stop (but not for accelerate, that's another icon  click ) and M does trigger the map even when the drop down action menu doesn't, but simple things like this are just not shown in the game. I am also now having problems understanding when things like extra ship modules are activiated or not because there is no positive flag or change in external visual appearance and it's unclear from all the differenet stats given whether suggested changes in ability are as a result of them being activated or deactivated unless you understand all the developer 's logic  which at this stage I do not.","April 8","false","28.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","1"

Found one person online and they stopped talking after I asked if they could help me with the starting missions.\n\nGood things:\n+ Interesting open world space with simplistic (if slightly buggy) click to point in that direction controls\n+ nice in game music (which later becomes a bad thing because it gets VERY repeatative\n+ Cool ship customization idea (though I haven't been able to see if the higher level modules are just reskins of old modules)\n+ Moderately interesting subfaction lore (at least on the human side).  Apparently things are set up in a sort of democratic caste system that is separated into "workshops" based on 4 ways to superiority: Fire power, defense, outranging/avoidance, and regeneration\n\nBad things:\n-- Little to no player base  (if they are out there, they aren't talking to me, and from the brief interaction I had, it really doesn't sound like they are out there)\n- EVE's semicrap passive skill system.  Get the required things to get that passive skill (like the ability to use certian things) and then place it on a timer.  There is also a second skill system that seems to be based on modules that your ship has but I have no idea how to get that to work.  this second one just gives you stat buffs it seems.\n- Poor UI management: While one side of the screen is nice with windows and menus you can collapse to move out of the way for better control of your environment, they seem to have forgotten to do that to the other side of the screen.  The quests alone seem to take up half the screen and can't really be clicked behind because a tool tip pops up then that basically just rewords what the quest says, not always helpful.\n- Various other things half clutter the other side of the quest log which is probably the reason the quest log is pushed out towards the middle of the screen.\n- poor instructions and tutorials:  often times I struggled with understanding what they meant or will find that I might have already been doing that.  Occasionally I'm meant to basically repeat previous actions and get results that wern't the same as before because the tutorial didn't want to show you what else you would get from those things at that time but now it wants to show you that you could also get other things with the same activities in a different mission.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure this game can be saved right now.  It will need an overhaul and a "rerelease" to draw in a nee before you could even call it a B list game.","April 18","false","1.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

While there are certainly a lot of things that could be improved on - faulty, difficult and confusing controls and the lack of clear instructions and guides for new players being it's biggest sins - Nebula Online is a fairly decent game. It's not revolutionary or mindblowing per se, but it's certainly promising and interesting.\n\nHowever, the developers need to start focusing on improving and patching the game's biggest and most fatal flaws instead of expanding the game and making it bigger than it already is. I feel like this game is way too ambitious; it has more than it's developers could handle. It's recommendable for them not to add any new features to the game and focus on working on the ones it already has.

The tutorial was very short but i was able to play the game, go mining, fighting, crafting, and so on.\n\nThe next good thing would be the speed of troubleshooting. There appeared an ingame bug, which made it impossible to buy or sell anything. They fixed it within 2 hours on a sunday.\n\nBut why was i dissapointed?\nGrafics? They are ok, the game is still in development.\nPromises: i will cite the description: "Create your unique ship, obtain resources, explore space together with your friends. "\nCreate your unique ship: you will find a short instruduction on the website, that you can build your own special ship by moduls. so what happend? When you create a new character, you will choose the class. From now on, you have your ship with 6 modules. You can replace each module by an other module of the same type. You will change some stats of your ship. Its like change your boots or sword in a common role-play-game by some better boots or a better sword. This is the part what they call "Create your unique ship". Skills are only related to your selected class.\n\nObtain resources: there are different recources which need different things to obtain. Gathering resources is very ineffective at the moment. But the game is still in development. So it might change.\n\nCrafting: You get from your enemys something like blueprints. You can go to any station and build it. All you know, is the level of the item and how many resources you need. But you never know what type of item you will get. Will it be a weapon? Something for movement? It will be always a surprise :P\nits ok, if they dont write the detail of the item with stats and so on, but to write what kind of item it will become would be great.\n\nConclusion\nThe lack of opportunities can still be closed by further development. The promise to create your own unique ship and have no real feature to do so is just the wrong way. Combined with very ineffective gathering of resources and a ineffective combat system it has nothing value left in the game.","March 13","false","2.9"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","17","32","2","0"

I prefer Windowed mode for a variety of reasons (easier use of a password manager, taking notes in a text editor during game play, and especially keeping an eye on my laptop's GPU heat).\n\n+ They came up with some creative playable races in addition to humans.  Background lore is limited, but at least there is a little.\n\n+ On first login, the interface displays some popup tips as you explore the various sections in the station's interface.\n- Some of them go by too quickly - I'm a slow reader.  Perhaps changing to click-or-tap to close instead of timed messages would be better.\n+ That said, the station interface seems pretty straight forward.\n\n- Although there is newbie help, it didn't seem to explain the actual ship movement & combat.  Or maybe I just missed those details.\n\n- Designed as a mobile app, there are no tooltips, and there's no key controls/mapping section in the Options, so figuring out ship movement & combat was more of a challenge than it might have been.\nI tried using the typical WASD FPS-style movement keys with only partial success.\nW & S tilt the ship up or down rather than acting as Forward & Brake.\nA & D do turn the ship left & right.\nThe ship can also be turned via the mouse, but I've not figured out how to do that consistently yet.\nThere are two "move forward" keys, one with a single arrow and one with a double arrow.\nIt took a while to figure out without tooltips and without a speed indicator on the HUD.\nTurns out the double-arrow icon is for going faster, but can't be used during combat.\nYou can double-click on an enemy to automatically orient your ship towards their current position and start moving towards them.  However, it isn't an auto-follow, so if they are moving around you will have to keep double-clicking them from time to time, while also adjusting the camera angle to keep them in view.\n\n- Lost my first NPC battle because I was expecting the attack key to be an auto-attack.  It wasn't clear to me at first that the periodic weapons fire between our ships was only coming from the enemy ship.  No big deal - I know how it works now.\n\n- The non-auto-attack attack button is a pain though.\nIts on the quickbar, so you can just press 1 to attack instead of clicking it with the mouse.\nThe mouse is needed for adjusting the camera to keep the enemy in sight, turn engines on/off, etc.\nThe attack timer is fairly short, so there is a lot of pressing 1 over and over and over, again and again...\nFor optimum DPS, you'll need to either split your attention between the attack timer and ship movements,\nor else spam the 1 key constantly.\nIn either case, I found it to be uncomfortable for my arm after a while\nand needed to relax & stretch my arm from time to time.\n\n- Although designed as a mobile app, its not available yet in Apple's app store.  Would like to try it on my iPad.\n\n- I'm not sure of this yet with my limited experience, but the game seems to be primarily level-based, with equipment also coming into play.  In a PVP MMO, a level-based system typically means there will be some very unbalanced combat between players of different levels, so that's a negative in my book.  I prefer PVP systems where everyone has a chance to take on anyone else, and the higher levels/ranks give the experienced player more options to choose from but don't make them invincible.\n\n+ Overall the game seems to have a lot to offer.\nOne can fly or "jump" to different locations within a system, and jump to different linked systems.\nI hear rumors of contested zones, player-owned stations, big mining operations on large asteroids,\nand even landing on planets.\nThere is a crafting system for upgrading your ship, new ships to buy, etc.\nThey have an auction and a reverse auction.\nIf I can find a way to play without getting a cramp in my arm, I'd like to explore all these things.\nSince this is an Early Access game, I'm hopeful that there will be a lot of interface improvements\nas development progresses.\n- Given the current state of the game (what little I've seen of it so far), I'd not recommend it (since I have to choose a Yes or a No to submit the review), but am hopeful that it will get better in time.  It has a lot of potential.\n___________________________________________________________________________\n2nd Look - a follow-up to my 1st review:\nAfter several more hours in-game, many of the negatives listed in my previous review seem trivial now.\n\nI've gotten the used to the interface for ship movement & combat as well as the somewhat unusual chat system.  Tried out grouping with others to team up on tough opponents, and even acquired the ability to repair teammates during combat.  Things are looking up, though with all the rough edges I'd still call it an "Early Access" quality game at this point.\n\nTo correct one mistake in my previous review, there's isn't actually a reverse auction.  I misunderstood what I was looking at.  Would be a great feature to add though.","January 16","false","15.0"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","1"

If it's being marketed to an English-speaking audience (amongst others), it direly needs someone who speaks English to be doing localization and editing. Hardly the only example, but a good one: when trying to refer to the heading of your ship, one of the 'tutorial' steps says "direction of go".\n\nI also realize that instructions and proper walkthroughs are a luxury at early stages of a game, but as it is in this current release, following the steps gets you killed very quickly, by landing you in a hopelessly outmatched scenario.\n\nWill I revisit this in a year? Possibly, I know there are probably a lot of good people putting hard work into this project, but from what little I've seen right now, the writing that went into the setting, the roughness of the graphics, and the lack of direction and editing at the foundation level - it all makes me wonder if this will make it out of early access.","March 20","false","0.2"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","12","23","4","1"

But, i would like to share me experiences of my first few minutes and how they turned out.\n\nSince I also recieved this game for free, im not one to judge.\n\nSo, upon first launch, I recieve a Unity launch window, which in my eyes, was slightly expected, but don't mind it at all. Except, yes, you can choose your resolution, graphics and display AND controls from all in this window. But, the only graphics option is Fastest (ok, I get it, its early access). It doesn't affect me, but this can throw people off since the graphics were good on Fastest, so people with potato PCs might die from it (Just sayin).\n\nIn game, it had a nice login screen (altough Im not sure why it can't use our steam ACC as a login already, but im no game dev so idk)and a nice Create screen to create your characters. But when it comes to Tutorials and teaching first time players how to do things in the game, this game lacks that. As a first time player, I read everything it gave me and understood about 40% of it. I still don't understand how to fly (once im in space) and I don't know what my objectives are, as well as how to even check (there is a notifications tab, but there are no markers on the screen).\n\nIf I had the ability to give a few bits of feedback, I would say that the game is well made, but there are a few things holding back its potential.\n\nIf the game had for example, a window that showed up at the start, after login, saying "Do you wish to go through an in depth tutorial?" And you had the option of Yes or No. The tutorial then helps you through the Character setup, Main screen and giving you basic directions when in flight. Maybe even a Training course to go around. This will help out first time players, like myself, who are having trouble with all the controls and different markers and all that. But, again, im no game developer, so I can't really take it upon myself to tell people what this game should and shouldn't feature.\n\nThis is just a feedback review, and my first experiences. If im doing anything wrong, please message me.\n\nThank you :D\n\n~Luca","March 11","true","0.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","3"

It only costs 5 euros, which, for the amount of content you already get, is not enough.\n\nIt is still in development, so expect future improvement on graphics, hud, controls, etc..\n\nDevs are active on the forums, asking for players opinions, which is a big difference if we compare it to other bigger games where they claim to be involved with the community, which most of the time is a lie, they are involved with players credit cards!

This is not the kind of game that doesnt get out of EA.

I look forward to seeing this game furthered in the future. So far I am loving it, and I am ok with the grind now that I can fire two weapons at level 2, and finally reached level 3 recently as the Borguzands which I have to admit their ship design is pretty cool, and the small customizations that come with each piece of equipment really makes my  Rahkgal or however its spelled look pretty wicked. I mean its sad I can't choose how it looks, but its like many MMOs where gear just happens to look different except only weapons drop, and the parts for your ship you have to build with some RNG luck on your side its something you want and something good.\n\nThe Auction system is helpful. I have managed to buy some useful parts for my ships from there, and have started selling weapons, and parts to the auction myself to help lower level players. Leveling is difficult at 1, but by the time you reach 2 and add some parts to your ship to get a second weapon it gets alot easier. There appears to be weapons that are... loud? I guess. The first weapon is quiet apparently as it doesn't attract attention, but the second one gets everyone on you, but by that time you should have some decent parts for your ship.\n\nSo far its pick race, pick a ship amoung the classes each of the ships look different between race, and function differently. Though I have to admit Borguzand has the coolest ships in the game being all organic like, and their territory is just so... mesmerizing with all those tentacles, bugs, and jellyfish looking things. Although it looks like most go for the other two factions as I don't see many on the Borguzand, and their is only like 3-4 coalitions currently up for them, and less than 50 combined for all those coalitions, but not everyone is in them. Meaning there could be other players not apart of anything at all.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game just to enjoy it now, and get pumped for the future. Sure its Early Access, but that just means more to come in the future, maybe. Some games don't make it, but I hope this one does. I really do.","January 20","true","3.8"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","1"

There are no large capital ships to work twords right now, so we have to see what it is the development plans are to play towards long term.\n\nBuilding / crafting is very rudementary and done-so with a click of a mouse after mining resources and obtaining blueprint drops.  There are modules for ships that can be simply crafted, and again the crafting system is nothing more than a one-click process right now.\n\nThe galaxy seems sizable, but have no idea about easter-eggs or value in exploration, as it doesn't seem to be there yet.  But alot of places to go, though whats the value in exploration is yet to be realized.\n\nPerhaps long-term, building stations will be an accomplishment and add to the incentive for game-play.\n\nThis leveling system is action-oriented and not handed to you over a short period.  So playing to gain development and advancement is certain and appreciated.\n\nI'd consider this game for some short hours of time-kill right now....its not a bad decision for $5 for me, and what I hope to see it develop into.","January 5","true","8.4"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","3","14","0","1"
