Sure, it's a little brainless at times, but that's why I love it. I only paid 2 dollars, but I feel like the normal 10 dollar asking price is still more than fair. The graphics are great, the gameplay is enjoyable, and it just reminds me of classic shooters where story didn't matter and you could have a blast just tearing enemies apart with friends. The customization isn't incredibly deep, but still respectable. You can choose between different face and outfit cominations, and there is a nice selection of unlockable weapons (all with multiple upgrades that also change appearance). I've purchased numerous AAA titles in the past few months and this game has already kept my interest longer than any of them. Anyone who puts this game down, especially for the price, simply can't handle the difficulty/play style- which is fine but that doesn't merit a bad review. Anyway, just round up some friends, grab some beer, and have a ball blowing demons into tiny bits.","March 28, 2014","true","9.4"," 148 of 179 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","148","179","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/akatarzynak/recommended/227480/","akatarzynak","AKatarzynaK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/akatarzynak/","388 products in account","In God Mode you play as a descendant of an ancient Greek god who is forced to battle hordes of creatures brought forth by Hades. There are five maps in which you can test your skills, each is vastly different and beautifully designed.\n\nFor every area you enter you will be given a trial to complete. You will be unable to enter the next level of the map until you have completed the trail at hand. These trails vary greatly and range from things designed to make gameplay more challenging such as lowering your maximum health, to more amusing things such as making all of your enemies wear silly tophats.\n\nCombat is fun and faced paced as you will continuously find yourself surrounded by enemies. There is a wide variety of weapons which you can earn and upgrade as well as different abilities which you can choose from.\n\nIn order to make the game more challenging you are able to choose between different levels of difficulty. There are also different handicaps called Oaths which you can turn on at the beginning of a map to give yourself more of a challenge and earn more gold/XP.\n\nSome of the reviews for this game seem to be taking it a little too seriously. If you buy this expecting a well polished top notch shooter you will be sorely disappointed. I got this game on sale for $2.00 and feel this was a great price for the how much entertainment it has provided. Well worth the purchase if you’re in the mood for some mindless fun, have a fondness for Greek architecture/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized mythology, and have a friend or two to play with.","August 7, 2014","true","12.6"," 59 of 72 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","59","72","5","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/227480/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","God Mode is an online, third-person shooter that focuses on horde mode style game play. The object is to find three other players, and work through five arenas mowing down enemies, and collecting XP.The XP system is pretty standard, although it takes a massive amount of points to level up.The action itself consists of taking on room after room of enemies. The basics of the gameplay are fun yet challenging, but once I tried to go it alone, things started to feel pretty overwhelming. Because the difficulty seems much more approachable with a group of four players, I suggest you stick to co-op. If you're looking for a good story, look somewhere else. The most you get out of God Mode lies in the loading screens that reveal your Olympian ancestry and in the narrator's bemused commentary on your invariably unheroic demise. For its low price, God Mode offers a lot, and has more polish than some bigger-budget titles. There’s plenty to do in terms of character customization, and the gameplay is fun and fast-paced. The Tests of Faith and Oaths add some variety to gameplay, but there’s a good chance you’ll find yourself getting bored once you’ve played through all five maps multiple times. The gameplay and AI just don’t offer enough variety to keep things fresh for longer than a few hours. Still, the basics are solid, and there’s a lot to enjoy about the overall package. If you’re after an arcade shooter that offers a few hours of entertainment, then you could do a whole lot worse than this.\n\n","July 21, 2014","true","17.0"," 66 of 85 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","66","85","0","2"

Let me explain why. So, before you buy, have this in consideration and make sure you're ok with the following:\n\n- You have to wait to have fun. Some weapons are more enjoyable than others. But the game has level requirement for upgrades and weapons. This means that you have to put a couple hours on the game before you get to full potential and get to experiment with all the weapons to figure it out which ones you want to use. After that, yeah chances are you will have fun with the game.\n\n- The Oaths system (you can get xp and gold bonus at the cost of some penalty like less damage, less health..etc) and the test of faith mechanics (conditions that affect parts of the map and are different each time you play) allow some gameplay customization and some variety.\n\n- Play co-op. This game was not made to singleplayer. Old School Games didn't even bother to escalate the number of monsters if you play solo. Of course you can go trough a map playing solo, but what's really the point if you'll beat the same map 3x faster playing with some people?\n\n- You probably will have to go on forums look for people to play with you. Let's be honest, not a crazy amount of people plays this game. There's an in-game matchmaking system, but you will probably spend a lot of time looking for players without succeeding. Your best bet is look on the forums where there's usually some players that will happily play with you, regardless of your skill level. You can avoid all this if you have friends you know well that are willing to play with you. But either way, the point i'm trying to make is: you will depend on other people to play this game.\n\n-Old School Games is not a great dev team, to say the least. This game had a tons of bugs, some of them avoided people to even play the game. Some of these bugs were VERY SLOWLY fixed, but some of them remain to this very day, still affecting some players. And you know what's best? While people were trying to get the game to work, Old School Games released "R.I.P.D.: The Game". You know what that game is? God Mode re-skinned. Old School Game attitude to me is a: "We have players that can't play our game? ♥♥♥♥ them. We need more money, so let's try to not fix our game, let's be worried in re-skin it to sell it again.". And you know what's even better? R.I.P.D. had some of the EXACT SAME BUGS of God Mode. Seems like a joke, right? Yeah...\n\nSo, if you are ok with all the above and you still wanna buy the game, go ahead. I'm not judging you. But if any of what i said above remotely bothers you and you think it will ruin your experience, don't.","June 18, 2013","false","32.0"," 58 of 80 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","58","80","0","0"

Same ♥♥♥♥, better co-op, longer campaigns, better bosses, around the same pricing.\n\nAfter 30 hours in this game, here are my conclusions:\n\nA. PROs and CONs\n\n+ humor\n+ interesting concept\n+ multiplayer\n\n- glitched achievements\n- too repetitive and predictable\n- only 5 maps to choose from\n- random crashes\n- buggy\n- poor optimization\n\nB. Achievement Hunting\n\nI have unlocked (legit way) 27/30 achievements. I stumbled into two bugged achievements and one mindless grinder achievement.\n1. Friendly Felony (Kill 25 teammates) - reported as bugged in many threads, nobody can unlock this the "legit way".\n2. Blow Up The Underworld (Purchase all upgrades) - this isn't bugged as often, some people managed to unlock it, however I purchased all upgrades for weapons, all upgrades for abilities, I even purchased all the cosmetic items, and still this achievement stayed locked. There was nothing left to purchase and/or upgrade, so it glitched out for me.\n3. Bone Carver (Kill 25 000 creatures) - Let me put it this way, even if you go solo you get between 400-500 kills per match. I'd say the average is 430. I played around 36 solo matches to gather the 5.000.000 in gold. I also played around 15 multiplayer matches with friends and still didn't come close to that achievement. Also worth mentioning, you won't get an achievement progress tab. You have no idea how many you have left. You'd have to play ~60 solo matches to make that number. A lot more if you play multiplayer and you split your kills with other people. For such a repetitive game, the grinding doesn't seem to have its place here.\n======== NOTE ========\nNo hope for the glitched achievements, the developers went bankrupt a while ago. I used an unlocker when I had 27/30 because it seemed pointless to even hope they'd fix them.\n========/NOTE ========\n\nC. Tips and Tricks: Buy and upgrade Plasma Pistol (crowd control), Minigun (crowd control, long distance shooting, big enemies, boss fights), Salvage ability maxed out (for maximum Gold/round).\n\nD. Conclusion: There is far too little content for me to say this is worth the money. Howerver, I got a 4-pack in a bundlestars.com pack for four bucks, so I'll give it a thumbs up.","February 13, 2015","true","30.1"," 52 of 74 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","52","74","2","14"

That is the game in it's entirety.  This might sound fun for mindless fun but the fact is it isn't.  Anti-fun.  A fun vaccum.  The black hole of fun.\n\nThe developers - real gems.  After releasing a broken game that wouldnt launch they would disappear for weeks on end.  They would respond finally, with a broken patch that may or may not have done anything, but only to promote a new game in current development.  They would then disappear again - to return when some newsbit about their second awful game - R.I.P.D (a reskin of this tripe).  They did delete and ban people from the Steam forums who decided to speak out against an outright scam.  Valve of course was complicit as they always are with the "contact the blah blah blah for a refund on blah blah blah".  They got their cut its good enough for Valve.\n\nSomehow they finally did release a patch that lo and behold made my God Mode work.  Sadly I played it then.  I think I would have been better off with the broken game.\n\nThe point?  Avoid this dumpster fire forever.  If it is 50, 75, 90, 100% off.

I only recommend buying if its on sale and if you have friends who will play it with you.\n\nPROS:\n- Co-Op\n- Interesting assortment of upgradeable guns (Railgun and Minigun are the best IMO)\n- Various upgradeable special abilities\n- Various "Tests" (Fog, Bombs dropping from the sky, poisoned, etc.) and "Oaths" (player takes more damage, player does less damage, etc.) make the game more challenging/interesting\n- Hordes of unrelenting monsters to shoot\n- Nice artwork, backgrounds, and ambience\n\nCONS:\n- Dead community\n- Not enough monsters to kill or maps to short/small\n- Not enough content, such as special bosses and maps\n- No in-game text chat!? wat da fuq?\n- In-game voice chat is complete sh!t (cuts out, echoes...we  just use Steam chat)","November 29, 2013","true","43.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/recommended/227480/","ErickaUnlimited","💝💝ErickaUnlimited💝💝","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/","777 products in account","Overview\nGod Mode is an area-based 3rd person shooter that focuses on surviving waves of enemies sent by Hades. The player takes control of a God who has been turned into a mortal by Hades and sent into the Underworld. The goal of the game is to navigate the levels, killing hoards of enemies, all while using an arsenal of various modern and futuristic weaponry at your disposal. The game can be played solo or up to four person co-op. There is no voice chat, or even text chat in game, which makes co-op extremely difficult without an external source of communication.\n\nThe game has no real story aside from what is mentioned above. Your backstory isn't explained and who the people are that you can select from, don't have a background, nor much information to go by. Your job is to kill or be killed; that's about all there is, really. The characters aren't terribly interesting and, honestly, I found them rather unappealing for the most part. There is a limited amount of customization given: clothing & face. Aside from that, you're out of luck.\n\nThe guns themselves are a little more interesting than the characters. As you level up your character, you're given the chance to buy weapons and upgrades with gold, which is earned at the end of the each level in the form of a gold arena. In these arenas, friendly fire is on (which is normally off) and you can either work together, or turn to greed. You get a limited amount of XP for killing teammates, but the experience isn't worth it in the end. You're far better off working together than going in as a Free-For-All (FFA). The amount of gold that spawns is proportionate to the amount of players; more players means more gold.\n\nThe levels themselves are interesting, but very, very limited in supply. There's only a small handful (about 5-6) in total, which makes the game very repetitive over long playthroughs or for achievement grinding. While the levels are rather dynamic and visually appealing, they grow weary after several hours of playing.\n\nAside from the poor quantity of levels, the co-op is hindered by a lack of communication abilities and the inadvertent drops and poor ability to connect to play together. I had no issues with co-op during LAN setups, but playing multiplayer can be a bit stubborn. That, and it is all but dead at this point. You really have to plan to play with others, as the lobbies are completely desolate.\n\nWhile the game has a lot of problems, it is a nice way to turn off your brain and pass the time. The enemy types are interesting, the level designs are done nicely and the random perks generated during segments make the game unpredictable; each stage has a totem that summons conditions such as stronger enemies, weaker ones, health degeneration, limited drops to even one-hit-kill and enemies with top hats. It's a nice add-on that gives the game a bit of breathing room and wavers off the stench of becoming too stale too soon. While I enjoyed it, the game needs work.\n\n\nPros\nAbility Totems - My favorite part of the game. It keeps you guessing.\nLevel Design - There's very few levels, but the ones that the game does have are well constructed.\nCo-op/Multiplayer - The game is far more fun with friends.\nGold Arena - Call a truce, shoot your friend anyway. What's not to like? Just don't lose your friend! xD\nHades - He's weird, snarky and makes questionable judgement about your player. I just wish he had more dialogue.\nCons\nCommunication - No text/voice chat. You better have an external way to communicate.\nLack of levels - Before you know it, you've played all the levels.\nBosses(?) - There are a few and they range from extremely easy to difficult. The progression of bosses is a bit unbalanced.\nAchievements - They are extremely grind heavy for you 100%ers. Get ready to play the same level over, and over, and over again...\n\nOverall, God Mode is flawed, but entertaining for what it tries to be. It feels rushed and has a lot of untapped potential. If you're looking for an arena game where you can just turn off your brain and run-and-gun, then God Mode might pique your interest. However, keep in mind the above mentioned flaws and take them into consideration before deciding if this game is right for you. Overall, I still would give it a positive review, as I did still enjoy playing it. God Mode just didn't live up to what it could of been.","March 16","true","15.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","2"

I would say the people who played, we were experienced players, however even if you have good aim and do not get hit often, you do not have the weapon power, the ammo, the health, or the powers to be able to finish a map. We were able to stay alive, until we ran out of ammo, due to the sheer numbers of enemies. Once our ammo was depleted, we were engulfed with mobs and literally were two shotted.\nSo, after playing on the normal mode and quickly ramping up our money and XP, using the money powers to gain as much as we could fiend, we were able to get some good gear (not the best) and go back to the harder modes. Now, if you've played your fair share of games, you should be okay, if you make a few mistakes, it can be punishing, however, it doesn't get annoying unlike a lot of other games when you die often.\nMy main criticisms to this game are the lack of levels. I think they should have a few more maps. If anyone knows of any, please let me know in the comments. Also, I think the game should have had a bit more content to it, weapons, or monster wise, however I understand, as I started playing, was near a final release.\n\nGot three friends who want to kill some time.

It feels really slow and clunky, but it has some neat ideas like every monster arena having a new rule to it like enemies can attack eachother or instead of blood everyone bleeds gold.\n\nThere's a two weapon limit which I don't think helps the game. You can buy new weapons, but for that you need gold that you get through gameplay, but to earn the right to buy weapons you need to be at a level, and it increases as each level goes on. There are also cosmetics that follow the same rule, but sadly there isn't that much to choose from.\n\nThere is no singleplayer mode in the game. To play singleplayer you just create an online match and start it without anyone joining in. There is a story, but it is told through a narrator and the loading screens, but to sum up it's basically "you died and now you need to fight your way out of hades." You don't have to worry about missing some extensive plot, I think.\n\nI think overall it's not a terrible game, but it's not as good as some of the other stuff you can buy here on steam. If you find it for cheap I say you should give it a try.

In the past, I troubleshooted for about 2 hours to get it working. It still crashed constantly, but I made about 10 hours of gameplay. One day I remembered this game and decided I wanted to play it again. It crashed on startup. The old troubleshooting didn't work. After I fixed one crash, I got a different one. Fixed another crash, a new one popped up. Online fixes told me to edit my registry and this and that.. I shouldn't even have to do that. Not worth it. I bought the 4 pack and nobody was able to play without issues.\n\nEdit: I'm not saying it will be like this for everyone, but look at how many people DO have problems. Out of 7 people I know, only 1 got the game to work with no problem. The rest got tired of the crashes and gave up trying to fix it.","November 28, 2013","false","11.7"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

Antrider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LFantrider/","426 products in account","RATING: 5/10\n\nThis is a purely splay and flay 3rd person shooter.  It is worth getting if you like 3rd person shooters.\n\nThe atmosphere is very hellish (which apparently looks like Ancient Greece).  The graphics are great, though.\n\nIn this game there is no time to strategize, hardly time to aim, and you will often get obliterated unless you're playing with some friends who are packing some heavy heat.\n\nThe weapons are fun... The monsters are gnarly and neat, although not varied between the different maps.  Unfortunately there are only about 6 maps, which after awhile can get a little old.\n\nIn the game description on the store page, I think the RPG/looting elements of this game were over-sold.  There are truly not that many customization options for skins compared to the awesome designs the developers could have come up with.  Also,  no promise of any more additional content coming in the future.  Also, it doesn't take very long to hit the XP/lvl cap and upgrade all your gear, at which point there is no need to loot anything at all because there are no consumables to purchase.  The abilities are universal across the board for players and really don't play into any game tactics at all, nor do they really add much to the characters.\n\nAs far as unique gameplay, each map you play has various challenges you must complete to get through the lvl.  There are only about 10-15 different challenges, but they are randomly selected each map which adds a nice layer of difficulty and mixes things up a bit.\n\nTHE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME:  It is a multi-player game that has the SH*TTIEST F*CKING multi- matchmaking system ever.  You will wait for hours to find another person by clicking "quick match".  You literally start to hear crickets after awhile.  However, there is a way around this.  Namely, go to the forums, find the thread titled GODMODE KONNECT by moi and add a bunch of friends who play God Mode.  Once in awhile I get a match going with a few good people.  This game can have potential to be fun solo too, though.... that is if you have some large cajones.\n\nOverall, this game needs more costumes, more unique abilities, and possibly some consumable items to purchase, and a better frackin multi-player setup.  It is, however, a nice little digression from more serious games.  So take a serious look at getting this game!  (When it's on sale for 2.50).","April 27, 2014","true","40.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

It looks fun visually and the concept of "firefight"/"onslaught" survival shooter was very appealing. And it does work well if you only play the first stage of the game, and if you play on easy.\n\nAs you near the end of the first stage the game becomes extremely difficult and you realize that it was balanced to only be played in coop. I don't even know whether two players alone could make it further than the first stage. You will simply be overwhelmed eventually , if not earlier, then sooner. I planned to play the game alone, and, as you can see, the description still advertises it as having "Single-Player", but it is simply not an accurate description. By "Single-Player" they only mean you start a closed multiplayer session and join your own game by yourself. I believe you cannot even pause the game because it still behaves as a match which others could join.  And , as I mentioned above, as a single player you won't get far in the game. So, the only way you could possibly enjoy the game is if you know for sure that you'll have at least one friend who will play in coop with you. Two or three friends would be ideal.\n\nThe graphics and action are just ok. You can customize your avatar to look cool, the enemies kind of look cool and are well animated. However these positive aspects wear off quickly when you are faced with a challenge. AI seems to be configured with a very basic algorhythm and all rush at you and. They don't make any cool manuevers, hide, or do any suprising stuff. Once I've reached an area where more enemies appear I've found that the only way to survive is to run backwards and to keep shooting at the oncoming horde. Not fun at all.\n\nDon't waste your time.","March 30, 2014","false","1.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/227480/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","The game is pretty decent. It has good shooting mechanics very similar to the Sniper Elite/Nazi Zombie Army games, and if nothing else it works well in that regard. Another reviewer said the Serious Sam games are better than this but I would rather play this any day because all of the Serious Sam games are bland ugly highly generic horse sh-t garbage. The sounds are good and the music fits as well. There are lots of unlockables and rewards for time spent which is a plus in any game. There are weapon upgrades you can buy and new skills to make higher difficulties possible. Enemies are standard fare for this type of game and the enemy type is pretty limited. The game is very tough at first but when you start ugrading and buying better weapons it gets easier.\n\nOnline has been dead for a long time so be ready to play alone unless you have friends that want to play. I've heard a lot of people say that playing with a friend isn't possible because it is buggy so you probably have a 50/50 chance of that working. So far I came across one crash in under two hours of play when after the level ended and began loading to the end score screen the game crashed with a runtime error. Thankfully though after starting the game again it had saved the gold and xp that I got from the level.\n\nThe game can provide some entertainment if you get it cheap like I did for a dollar which was a good deal. I've seen much worse games that tried to be unique shooters and just sucked it big time, like the Serious Sam games. I would rather have a mop from a Walmart bathroom mop bucket wrung out over my open mouth than ever play a Serious Sam game again. Ever.\n\n7/10","November 21, 2015","true","7.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","4","7","3","0"

There are many enemies to mow down with all this, a couple or so bosses available, multiplayer with others, and plenty of achivements. And then, comes the cons.\n\nThe game is buggy here and there, matchmaking is broken at this point. Lets talk about that for a quickie. Its impossible to find other players either because the game is terrible at it, or there isn't enough players in this meat grinder of a game. Try to find other people, I just dare you to because it is impossible to, so your only hope is single player.\n\nEven though the single player is fun, you'll get bored pretty quick with the repetitiveness of the both the same enemies and 5 levels that it offers in this bundle of a game. Leveling of your weapons and such is slow so get ready to play alot of this game. Its fun in its own right to the likings of the older Serious Sam games out there, but its easy to get bored with, and thats because of the 5 lone levels, thus, removing the fun when you pull a few hours or less into it.\n\nThe enemies given in this game are fun and creative, but they show up to offten and the number count on them is relatively small, about an hour or so into the game and you'll start to see them more then you should be. In a run and gun, have a wide variety of enemies like Serious Sam, then it will be a lot better, trust me.\n\nSound and level design is creative, I actually enjoyed it and wished there was more levels cause the game looks pretty good. Not Guild of Wars or Dark Soul's level of good, but just enough to be enjoyable.\n\nThe amount of guns......are desent. Its not big, but its not too small. A couple of them are creative like that buzz saw thing (I forgotten the name), but it will take a while to get to due to the small earnings you get from the single player you MUST play due to, again, the broken multiplayer. And character customization is limited in my opinion overall. There just isn't enough to it that it will keep me or many others attached to.\n\nThe game overall? Its an OK game. About a 4.6/10. I give it this due to its lack of content that I was expecting from a run and gun. Run and guns are easy to get repetitive so you need to have plenty of stuff to keep the player interested in. This game only has up to 5 stages and the enemies dont hold it up. Though the design and overall look of the game IS pretty sweet in its own way (lets admit, the only other greek shooter you know of is Will Rock), but it wont have enough to keep others playing. And the broken multiplayer that is shown to be a fun factor that doesn't work doesn't help the game either. This is my speculation overall, and I hope you enjoyed it.\n\nThe game isn't for everyone, but if you like shooting stuff, go right ahead, just dont expect the multiplayer to hold up well","July 2, 2015","false","6.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It's next to impossible gunplay mixed with the crazy Tests of faith such as one shot kills and ever draining health make for one big pissoff of a game.

The somewhat "Open" array of customizational features with chlothing, mixed with the cool demon killing weapons makes for a heck of a fun time. On that note, my final verdict is thus: Play the game with some friends, and you'll be sure to enjoy the game for what it has to offer. Play the game alone, and be prepared to die an infinite amount of times.

The weapon selection is uninspired and most will end up using the same pair of guns, that is if the limited selection of maps will still hold your attention.\n\nThe game does shine briefly in COOP mode, when it works, and will deliver a few hours of intense action, although once the maps have been conquered, the only thing that might keep you around are the ungodly grind achievements (minus the broken one).

As in similar games such as Painkiller and Serious Sam you fight huge numbers of enemies, advance to the next area, kill all that moves, advance, and so on...\n\nThe game adds a bit of variety to that repetitive concept by sometimes giving you random effects for the duration of a battle, such as infinite ammo or tougher enemies. Even though this game is in no way meant to be a revolution to the genre, it has some things that motivate you to play this a few times, like unlockable weapon upgrades, unique activatable abilities, skins and so on, which you can earn by earning experience and collecting coins as you play. The difficulty can be adjusted from anything between baby mode to impossible and can be further refined through several modifiers - the harder the game gets, the more experience you earn.\n\nWhile the level variety is very small (5 maps), the worlds are well designed. The graphics, effects and animations are very good considering this is just a rather cheap download title, also the game runs smooth at high FPS. The scenarios and the monsters you fight fit the theme of hades, which is ancient greece meets hell, basically. No complaints about the sound, either. The controls are fine, but the movement feels a bit slow overall, which makes strafe-gunning a lot less effective than usual, but you get used to that quickly. Some people have complained about bugs in this game - I have encountered a few glitches with the physics and clipping issues, but those were never gamebreaking, though sometimes hilarious.\n\nOverall, God Mode does its job well, its a nice pickup for any fan of shoot-em-ups, especially when you grab this on sale. It may get repetitive after a while, but if you are joined by a few friends, and have some time to kill (pun intended), this is just the right choice.","November 27, 2014","true","11.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You start by creating a character from the many different character customizations, choose your weapons, oaths, maps, difficulty etc. and everything seems promising and you're good to go.\n\nIf you're playing by yourself you are soon outnumbered and outmatched on the easiest difficulty which means you're screwed if none of your friends play the game because, even if you're playing with other people they will leave halfway through the game and are generally useless/annoying.\n\nHowever, even if you play with friends you won't be able to complete a single mission because your game will crash 10 minutes into playing it and force close it self, or it will just crash every 5 minutes without force closing and after having a frozen screen for 10 seconds or so it will finally resume.

Each of these mazes can be played in 4 difficulty settings from Bronze to Platinum. Each of these mazes consists of many stages that you have to complete to proceed to the next one. apart from the standard "Kill everyone" objective you also give a "test of faith" which is a specific condition posed in your current stage of a specific maze of a specific difficulty level. For example - "Life 	- Max life is reduced by 25 but regenerates over time." so these kind of things that happens in each of the stage fights.\n\nYou fight - you earn XP and Gold - you upgrade - and you fight more; that is pretty much what explains the game.\n\nFor me the game stands out for its simplicity and fun element. Grab a 4 copy of this game from steam and play with friends - its really fun, trust me.\n\nOne (-) point is that I am not sure if there is any active development that is going for this game (or in the community , so to speak) , so you are pretty much stuck with what the game currently offers to you.\n\nSo on the final verdict I give this game a 6.5 out of 10.\n\n~ your spirit guide ~","January 20, 2015","true","23.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The gameplay is alright but the balance is a bit off.  Enemies are generally faster than you, and hiding doesn't work, your weapons are too weak for the first 4 or 5 player levels to achieve much, and the weapons need to be "modified" which can only be achieved by leveling up the player character and collecting gold.  So it's like the first 4 to 8 levels (which represents about 8 to 10 hours of gameplay) are loaded with lots failures and deaths.  This is what I mean by poorly balanced.  I'm a Quake player myself and the whole idea of having to spend hours dying BEFORE you can enjoy the game is a bit silly IMO so keep that in mind if you're reading this review.  If you like or are used to that kind of game design this likely won't bother you as much.\n\nThere may be unlockable maps at higher levels, I dunno, but for the first few handfulls of levels there are only 5 available to co-op players.  This limits the experience and makes the game a bit shallow.  Especially considering several levels are bugged and either crash immediately or glitch out in a way where the player can not proceed further and the game just sits there with you on an empty map with no enemies and no ways to proceed - nothing to do but ESC to the main menu where you can try another map level.  :/\n\nMy friend purchased 4 seats of this game for $2 total so given the price (which was zero for me - as I was one of the persons he gifted one of the seats to) it's well worth the experience!  So far my friend and I have spent about 6 hours in this game. I assume we will be tired of it completely in another 10 or 20 hours - so that's a pretty good value for that price even considering it's shortcomings. Imagine going to a thrater with three friends and being able to watch 24 hours of films - all for just $2.  Even if a few of the movies were duds it's still a prety good deal!  That said, there's no way I would pay more than about $8 or $10 for a single seat of this for myself for example.\n\nYou can of course get on youtube and watch the trailer and some people's recordings of gameplay so I won't try to describe the action other than to say it's a shoot everything that moves kinda game - which I like quite allot myself! :)  The controls are fairly typical of a third person shooter (WASD, SPACE, a shield Key, and the mouse buttons) or even a bit on the simple side which I find refreshing!  Games that overcomplicate KB mappings or controller combinations are /typically/ a bit of a drag  IMO and severely detract from the experience.","February 1, 2015","true","4.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I believe), and is fun when you want instant action and feel the need to kill a varity of monsters.\n\nCon: -There is no story, which is not a bad thing for some, but just a warning.\n-There are only 6 levels to play, some harder and longer then others, which gets repetitive when grinding for money and experience.\n-There are also only 10 types of monsters to kill, with only slight variants in some of the models, which again can get repetitive as well.\n-There are no mods for this game as well, which again is not a issue, just a warning.\n-Lastly, expect to play solo unless you have friends buy the game with you, because, at least for me, I've never been able to connect to another person, and I've sat in a queue for 2 hours.\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RustyBoom/recommended/227480/","RustyBoom","KiggerBoom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RustyBoom/","269 products in account","A really quite challenging, yet very funny game. They don't over abuse the jokes and each one is as funny as the next. You'll battle through stages of one of the many levels as reach towers that grant you a certain bonus (whether good or bad) to help you tackle that stage. Increase the difficulty yourself by giving yourself more negative effects for more reward should you finish! A large veriety of guns, wish there was more in terms of customisation though.\n\nMy one warning for this is that if you want to get the maximum potential of fun out of this game, bring friends! The multiplayer died a long time a go and you're lucky if you find one other person online. You can play with up to 4 people, so you really need to find 3 friends.\n\nAlso nearly forgot to mention, when you finish a level you go to the treasury room where you race for as much cash as you can grab! You can also kill those 3 good friends of yours and steal their money too. They won't respawn.","April 5, 2015","true","15.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's decently animated, and visually nice. That's about where the good stops and the bad ends.\n\nAttacks hit you when they aren't anywhere near you, everything is sluggish in the wrong ways, the spawns and maps always play out the same outside of the 'random' trials that do nothing to change 'what' you are fighting. Oaths do very little to spice things up as well, and hell, you could chances are slap all but 2 on you and you wouldn't notice any real change in difficulty.\n\nIt's also extremly lacking in stages, only having 5, and only 3 have pre-set bosses at that.

It's basically just the memory of me playing The Club back then (awesome !).\nAnyway, it all comes down to shooting down hordes of enemies and leveling and customizing your character and his weapons. Fun for a few games/hours. After that, you should've seen most of the interesting things already. The best part of the game are the random mutations giving you stuff like unlimited ammo or tougher enemies.

God Mode je poměrně lehká střílečka (co se týče pochopení), běžíte, střílíte, sbíráte bonusy. To je asi tak vše co v této hře děláte. God Mode je poměrně repetetivní, ale pokud máte kamarády s kterými hrát, na několik hodin zabaví, protože jeho zajímavý systém "test of faiths" zaručí, že každá hra bude mírně jinačí a ze začátku bude překvapovat.\n\nSystém spočívá v tom, že každý "maze" je rozdělen na pár částí a v každé části aktivujete "test of faith" který vyvolá náhodný event. Nemusí být vžd na vaší straně, jsou tu pozitivní eventy i negativní eventy. A to zapříčiňuje tomu že každý maze se bude vyvíjet trochu jinak.\nŠkoda avšak je že ve hře je málo map. Až každou projedete (jedno na jakou obítžnost) tak už v podstatě nebudete mít co dělat. Žádný komunitní obsah, nové mapy nebudou. Slyšel jsem že devs zbankrotovali a tak je tato hra oficiálně mrtvá.\n\nJde vidět že devs chtěli do hry dát mnohem víc, protože je tam až nechutně hodně upgradů a skillů na odemčení a přitom jen pouhých pět map, kdy jednu dohrajete cca za 30 min (Bronze difficulty). Takže to je škoda.\nDalším obrovským problémem je matchmaking, pokud nemáte kamaráda/y co by s vámi hráli, musíte se smířit s faktem, že budete hrát jen solo. Matchmaking systém je naprosto neschopný a nenajde nic.\n\nA ještě jednou k pozitivním věcem. Líbí se mi ten humor a zvláštní nápad.

The main problem with it is that it's not that great if playing single player, and maybe I just picked a bad time of day but after a few minutes I didn't have any luck finding anyone to play coop.\n\nIt's basically a relatively mindless arena TPS shoot-em-up game with wacky gameplay modifiers. Decent variety of weapons, and you have to collect ammo for them though that isn't too difficult. Some actions (like reloading and such) take too long for the speed of monsters in the arena (which is why you really need to play coop, so someone can cover you while you're trying to reload). You're pretty much just constantly mobbed with mobs the whole time and in single player you'd need continuous shooting with no reload time to hold them all off.\n\nI didn't really like some of the overly goofy style decisions in the game, like the goofy sarcastic voice, especially since they don't seem to entirely fit with the rest of the style, but I suppose that's just a matter of personal taste. To me these elements are just stupidly goofy, not humorous.\n\nSo in short, not a terrible game but I wouldn't recommend buying it unless it's significantly discounted. (I got it in a bundle.) It also pretty much has to be played coop as the design practically requires it even if the implementatin technically doesn't.","August 16, 2014","false","9.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

On the other hand, it can be very hard to find a match with other people, so I strongly suggest you get one or a few friends to buy it and play with you. It will give your hours upon hours of fun and has a surprising replay value on the somewhat small amount of maps/levels. Upgrading weapons is laid out well and is only slightly too quick. The game seems to have a nearly perfect difficulty level as it can be a relaxing spray-shooting game or on higher difficulty, it can require a lot of strategy with your friend(s) to make it through the round.

There's only 5 maps and 3 different difficulties (Easy Bronze, Medium Silver, Hard Gold).\n\nYour mission is to get from Point A to B and on every new stage there's so called "Faith's" or random events that i prefer to call it, like tougher enemies or unlitimed ammo etc. You can be up to 4 players in a game.\n\nIn the end of every map you get to a zone called "Gold rush" where your mission is to collect as much gold as possible. The zone is also PVP, which means you can kill your enemies preventing them to gain gold.\n\nWith your gold and XP you can unlock new weapons, abilities and upgrades, even visuals for your character. So it's like a grind-game.\n\nFor being so cheap, the game is worth it's cost, since it will keep you occupied for like 10+ hours and you will still not unlocked everything.\n\n_Pros_&_cons_\n+ Addictive.\n+ Random events.\n+ Many guns.\n+ Challenging.\n+ Cheap.\n+ 4-player coop.\n\n- Few maps.\n- Controller feels a little bit clumsy sometimes.","September 29, 2013","true","14.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/weaselbiggs/recommended/227480/","weaselbiggs","WeaselBiggs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weaselbiggs/","185 products in account","Ever played Painkiller? God Mode is exactly like People Can Fly's first offering, if only in third-person. It's essentially arena combat, which involves facing wave after wave of enemies with little to no context or plot considerations. The object is to outlast this rather gruelling gauntlet, or at least to survive as long as you can.\n\nTo help in this, most of the arenas are littered with colour-coded power-ups. Red for health, blue for armour, yellow for ammunition and gold pickups. Green is bad. Stay away from the green stuff, seriously. Most enemies also drop temporary versions of these same items. Being that the game purportedly takes place in Hades, however, and that you're just one of several wayward souls to pass through here (unsuccessfully), each of the stage's distinct arenas confers one of several random buffs or debilitating effects, a bit as if you'd spliced in Unreal Tournament's Mutators and shoved them through a randomizer.\n\nAs you can imagine, some buffs will make your life considerably easier (Yay, random applications of actual God Mode!) to markedly worse (you do less damage but your rechargeable ability takes less time to reload?! Dafuq? How is that useful?!). You have no control over which effects are applied and when, which adds to the unpredictability of the basic package. No two games will generate the same items or apply the same stat modifiers, and I'm told the game scales relatively well in multiplayer. The end result is something that plays like a breeze one moment, and that kicks your little heinie to the curb the next. Expect absolutely wild difficulty spikes, considering this – not so much within a single game, but from game to game in general. Considering, your best bet is to learn how to ply your two-weapon loadout as effectively as possible, and to upgrade it as you progress.\n\nOtherwise, God Mode comes with a few customization options in the strictly aesthetic area. You've got a few basic heads, a few basic torsos and thematic variations of each for good measure. This is where the game's very incisive but somewhat superficial sense of humour enters the picture. Wanna play as a cowboy zombie in a camo vest with jeans who also happens to wield a laser pistol? Put in some time, and you'll learn enough gold and levels to unlock extra parts.\n\nUnfortunately, this is pretty much the be-all and end-all of God Mode. You're throwing yourself into nightmarish gladiatorial matches so you can gain more cash so you can customize your loadout so you can throw yourself into yet MORE nightmarish gladiatorial matches without dying... It's a vicious cycle that only seems vicious, because it has one pre-planned way out; that being the levelling up of every single piece of gear in your possession. Once you've unlocked and buffed everything up, then what?\n\nAs the game doesn't answer that question, I'll settle with giving it a warm, but cautious endorsement. This is a great quickie for the summer doldrums, folks. Boot up, clear one or two arenas, spend some gold... That's it. No need for serious investment. The guys at Old School obviously know their nineties' FPS gore and splosion-fests.\n\nMy advice? Buy this absolutely right away if you're an unconditional Painkiller fan. If you're not and prefer your shooters more slower-paced and tactical, save ten bucks for a rainy day and give it a whirl.","April 24, 2013","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now I usually don't write detailed reviews, but I thought that I needed to get my opinion out there. This game, God Mode has a pretty interesting story. You are a descendant of a god that was banished from the heavens, and now to prove yourself worthy of becoming a god again, you must fight wave after wave of enemies set in a greek mythological world. Let's get into this.\nRight off the bat, there's no introduction. It pulls you up to a menu with options to create a match, join one, etc.\nI decided to create a match to test whether or not the game was actually fun.\nSo I spawned in with my SMG and double barrel and walked to where I thought was the destination I had to go to, as the game did not tell me where or how I was supposed to go.\nI get to the location and found myself surrounded in a wide open room of skeletons. Classic, I thought.\nShooting and moving being the only thing I knew how to do, I tried to survive. Any control tutorial was non-existent.\nAfter 30 seconds I was dead.\nI looked in the controls and found that sprint was space, melee was right click and ADS (aiming down sights) was E, not to mention that the sensitivity for the mouse was extremely high.\nAs an average PC gamer, I can confirm that those controls are completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nAfter changing them to my preferred buttons I continued the game, might I remind you that you have 3 lives and while I was changing these settings I was getting slaughtered without consent, listening to my character moan and bleed.\nWith one life left I managed to kill 10 skeletons and then get brutally ripped apart by a gigantic fat guy.\nIt wasn't pretty.\nI decided to restart the match and change up my tactics a little bit.\nAll I did was run around the map, firing a clip behind me then collecting ammo/meds and running again.\nAnd then when I had killed everything and was waiting to traverse to the next area, I found myself stuck.\nI saw that the problem was that there was skeleton archers atop a bridge far frome my reach. Trying to shoot them proved it to be nearly impossible without wasting every single bullet I had, as the accuracy on the SMG was absolute ****.\nAfter killing them I finally got to move to the next stage, which was pretty much the same thing with a slightly different layout. I died on that stage.\nDetermined to see what else this game had and to give it another shot I tried multiplayer, and to my surprise I actually found another player. Confused, lost and newby, but I found another player!\nWe played the same level I was having difficulty on and managed to get to the second to last stage.\nDuring each stage, there is a modifier that changes up gameplay, and the modifier switches upon getting to the next stage. Some are good and some are bad.\nDuring my gameplay with this other player on the second to last level, we got a modifier that was meant to be extremely OP, but in turn was a game breaker.\nEvery minute or so, one of the players would get a graphically pleasing and high-damage hammer of the gods, that after another minute would switch to the next player.\nBoth me and him found this hammer extremely under powered, as it hit slow as anything, and only one-hit the weakling skeletons that are usually a 5 shot with your ol' SMG, not to mention that you can't run with this hammer, making fighting harder, bigger, faster foes more difficult. The most difficult to fight was the ranged enemies, as they would run and strafe-fire at you, making fighting them with the hammer completely impossible.\nThat was the level we died on.\n\nI really think that the devs of this game, in the beginning of development, had everything going for them. A half-fresh game idea, lots of time, etc. But the direction they took it made the game absolutely horrid. To sum everything up, here are some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\nGreat graphics\nDecent level design\nNo pay-to-win\nLots of customization\n\nCons:\nDead matchmaking\nExtremely boring farm/grind\nExtremely difficult as a beginner\nBland weapons\nBland upgrades\nCustomization options are all the same with slight differences\n\nThank you for reading this!

The worst offender on console was an enemy totally disappearing from the arena, making it impossible to complete the Test. I have had this happen to me a few times on PC as well; just look for hidden Harpies. The best glitch (if you're playing with someone) is their character model absolutely spazzing when you hit Gold Rush.\n\nI paid a combined $10 for the game both times; if multiplayer was more vibrant than a graveyard, one copy of God Mode could very well be worth the cost of the 4-Pack.\n\nNo more than a handful of everything – excepting (slightly dissimilar) customization options, sorts of enemies (not necessarily Types of enemies) and Tests of Faith (randomly generated 'objectives' given as you progress through each stage of the map - these are what make the game good; anything from the distortion of the sound, to the enemies wearing Party Hats, to Weapon Roullette, to brief stints of God Mode (invincibility) and about 40 others) - provided you don’t mind mindlessness, you will find much fun and entertainment to be had.\n\nTo be sure, avoiding the throngs of Hades takes a fully focused player – before you’ve acquired several (tens of) thousands of Gold, you won’t even be able to attempt a difficulty higher than Bronze; you’ll be lucky to have half your party survive Silver (should you be playing cooperatively). The mindlessness lies in the 5 maps.\nUnderstand that, with no bias from the PS3, on my pitiful ‘puter, the scenery is AWEsome; quite often I’ll find my completion times are indicative of a poor player. I was busy marveling at the sprawling Basilisk(?) statue, the punishing Tornado (which is really a hurricane in a vertically conical shape) and the… fire dungeon. Honestly, though, you can only play the same 5 maps so many times before it becomes (a little) monotonous. Still: the game is fun and I find it a crime that it didn't get a bigger player-base.\n\nAddressing gameplay: You have your standard weapons (the default SMG should be your go-to gun for a while) and then you’ve a few exotics: Plasma Pistol that shoots in an arc (great for crowd control), Buzzsaw that can both launch blades or be used in melee, Crossbow that shoots (multiple) flaming bolts, etc. Dodging is necessary and you will be appalled at how little it seems to help at times; you might be soothed in knowing that you CAN reload while sprinting. The default Ability, Shield, is decent, but Healing should be the priority (as it has an area-of-effect), and then Salvage for more loot; you can also call down Zeus' bolts or use a Hammer that makes Thor's seem useless.\n\nNo grenades, only one map in which native traps could help you, no sniper rifles (per se) or distractions from you as a target: you are on your own, whether actually soloing or not.\nThere is a gratuitous auto-aim function (you’ll be glad to have it), but the firing rate on the semi-auto weapons detracts from their power, unless you can line up several targets. To reiterate: SWARMS. The auto-aim is handy for the teleporting Mages and the poisonous Scarabs.\n\nAll-in-all: A surprisingly fun shooter that I can’t help but call (however loosely or shallowly) God of War with guns. I doubt that the dev’s could have done much better in the execution, with the exceptions of (more) advertising (to ensure at least a decent-sized multiplayer community), more maps and more bosses (with different mechanics to handle each):\nThe Queen Harpy is the hardest boss because sometimes you’re just screwed, there’s no escaping it's screech. The massive Monsters that are in and stay in the background are just begging to be destroyed; perhaps they could have implemented a sort of platforming/swinging battle to dispense with the fire beast that turns the cogs in the fire dungeon level.\nHowever, I honestly feel that asking for anything more from this title would just be greed on the players’ part. I can understand not wanting to pay full price for such a relatively sparse game with no one still playing it, but if you’re up for an arena game based in Greek mythology, you won't regret going God Mode.","September 22, 2014","true","53.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its even more fun with friends. The biggest issue that I have with the game comes from networking troubles, and that while all other games were working over my LAN just fine, GodMode just didn't want to stay connected.\n\nThe game is (most of the time) a co-operative game where you last against waves and waves of enemies before moving on to the next area to try to last through waves more. Each enemy offers a different kind of challenge, and during each wave modifiers will randomly activate to make things more interesting. The "Oathes" system is great because if you're having an easy time with a particular level you can turn up the difficulty a little bit with each oath, in exchange you earn more rewards.\n\nIts tons of fun, and honestly doesn't require much of a system to play.

After you died in a freak accident, you find yourself in Hades. (That's Hell in a toga, for those unfamiliar with Greek mythology.)\nAlso, you are a descendant of a divine bloodline banished from Olympus long ago.\nIn order to get out of Hades and reclaim your rightful status, you have to fight your way through hordes of monsters, including cyclopes, harpies and undead, all the while being tested by random acts of the gods.\nWhile doing so you are guided, and after some time mildly annoyed, by a narrator calling himself the "Soul Guide" who begins every game with a narration of your death (some of which are, quite frankly, hilarious) and proceeds to spout one liners throughout the game, commenting each of your deaths and announcing special events.\n\nThe game itself is a plain old horde style survival shooter. You choose your loadout, consisting of two guns and a special skill, and kill monsters until the area is clear and you may proceed. Rinse and repeat.\nAfter you beat the last area of the map (which on some maps is a boss fight), you get to a room full of gold, which has an interesting twist: Friendly fire is now enabled, so you can kill your former team mates and claim the gold for yourself. Or you could just try to run and collect as many coins as possible before the time runs out.\nYou are rewarded with gold to spend on weapons, customisation and upgrades, and experience points to level up and unlock said objects. Level progression is rather quick, so as to not bore the casual player; you can reach the level cap after around 20 hours of play time.\n\nAdmittedly, the game gets dull pretty quickly when playing it alone, since it only has five different maps, consisting of around 5 areas each. Having people to play with helps stave off that boredom; the game continues to be fun even after playing each map over and over together.\nBut here's the catch: The community is basically dead at this point, so you will have to either play solo or get your friends to play the game with you. Which, in and of itself, might not be an easy task, as you will have to convince them to pay 10€ (or equivalent) for a co-op game that has no community to speak of.\n\nThe difficulty of the game does not scale to the amount of players in your party either, which makes solo play all the more difficult on the higher difficulty levels since you will have to fight hordes of monsters designed for four players alone.\n\nLast but not least, this game has lots of unfixed bugs, some of which can break your game. These include crashes when joining multiplayer games, the broken matchmaking system and enemy spawns not being triggered properly.\nUnfortunately, the devs cancelled their support of the game shortly after release, so at this point it is highly unlikely these will ever be patched out. Luckily, you do not stand alone with your problems; there are lots of forum posts around the net explaining how to fix most of those issues yourself.\n\n\nIn conclusion, this is a good game gameplay-wise, which at one point had potential to true greatness but never chose to pursue this, leaving many issues for the players themselves to work out.\nNonetheless, the game plays well, looks great and can be really entertaining if you manage to get it running and find someone (such as friends, strangers on the net, or your grandma) to play with or are fine with playing solo. If you like 3rd person shooters, Greek mythology and horde style run-and-gun gameplay, and are willing to work your way through some forums before getting started, you should get more than your money's worth of entertainment out of this game.\nIf, however, you are easily bored and/or frustrated, and/or have no friends, you are hereby strongly advised to refrain from this purchase.","December 22, 2014","true","39.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

BECAUSE THAT'S ALL YOU GET IN THIS GAME ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI can't stress how disappointing this game is. I watched the trailer, told my friend to get it so we could play it in co-op. I still feel godawful for making him waste his 7 dollars.\n\nLooking at the trailer/teaser, and hopping into the game you're thinking: "Wow, this actually looks good for the price." The environment is cool looking, there are some neat details to it, enemies are well designed, it seems like there's one thing off your head and you're gonna have a good time with this game. Well, after all someone took a lot of effort to make this game look representative, right?\n\nGUESS AGAIN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nGet thrown into hell, the shooting is ok, running is ok, you even get some minor abilities/powerups which you can use but are neglible. The problem is the game is extremely repeatitive. Not much is happening, game ain't fun, you just shoot and run, rince and repeat.\n\nWhat you say? This game is all about exactly that? Well, no. There should be some element of the game to keep you occupied, make you play the game over and over again. Like some rewards, or new content. Sure, you can unlock some guns and ♥♥♥♥, but it's only a few weapons and they don't even feel any good, they really don't, man.\n\nYou would expect bosses, right? Some people thought this would be better Serious Sam. IT REALLY IS NOT. There are like 3 bosses, something like 5-6 stages and if you're looking up to defeating those challenging enemies requiring preparation and strategizing, well you're gonna be disappointed. They are fairly easy and don't do anything you really wouldn't expect.\n\nIf only they put more content into this game, added a few stages/added randomed dungeons/maps, added bosses, maybe some more unlocks allowing you to use some other strategies than shoot n run it would be really OK, but it's not, and it most probably won't be since this game is ♥♥♥♥ing forsaken by either god or the czech studio that developed that piece of crap.\n\nIf you're asking yourself: "hey how bad can it be?"\nDon't. Just don't. It is as bad as described, don't look at the trailer, look here, it's bad. Super bad. Don't buy. Slap yourself in the face before you actually buy the game so you don't buy it in the end at all. FIN\n\nPS.\ninb4 you played this game for merely 3 hours! - it's enough to unlock everything in the game and beat every single stage and boss. Not even joking.","September 9, 2014","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, after modding my weapons a tiny bit and getting used to the bizarre control scheme, I really started to appreciate the intense atmosphere of the game. Whilst the game is unfriendly to newcomers, it is - no doubt about it - one of the most intense third person shooters that I have ever played. I particularly enjoyed the aspect of Greek mythology that was included in the game, though there were some elements that were incorrect. The soundtrack and atmosphere of the game really set the mood, and the random "Tests of Faith" sometimes had me laughing, and other times cringeing. The "Spirit Guide" can sometimes be a real pain to listen to, but otherwise he is genuinely amusing and likeable.\n\nWhilst this game gets quite a lot of negative reviews for being a mindless shooter, I think that this game is of great value for it's price, though would maybe recommend buying it when on sale. I feel sad that I can never find anyone to play the game with as well, as I think that it would be a lot more fun with friends. Overall, this game satisfied me after a few brief moments of frustration, and I think I will definitely continue to keep playing the game.","May 3, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the concept of riddling creatures from the Greek mythology with bullets. The graphics are decent and although the game only has a few levels some of them look gorgeous.\n\nThis is a typical multiplayer shooter: you fight against waves of enemies and the further you progress on the level the tougher encounters you have. Eventually, there is a boss but not every level has a final countdown in this form. You collect XP in order to level up and upon completion of a level you can pick up a lot of gold coins enabling you to purchase upgrades for your weapons and even to customise your character by buying various types of clothing.\n\nGod Mode is nothing special but the mythology here makes the shooter an interesting game albeit it still remains a bit mediocre.\n\nI do not recommend it for the same reason I did not recommend the two Sniper Elite Zombie Army games: finding a host is impossible! In fact, even if you are the host you can spend eons until someone joins.

No tutorial or direction on what the hotkeys are (and they vary somehwat from most games) or what you should be doing or not doing (apparently shooting a barrel at close range is suicide rather than a source of powerups).  End portal can spawn on you and warp you to the next area before you finish picking up powerups.  Quick join never loaded me into a game, maybe becauase no one else is playing this game?

It's a fun co-op shooter that pits the player against tons of monsters\n\nPros:    You get to shoot a ton of dudes\nLike, a pretty ample supply of target-dudes awaits\nMaxing out your upgrades on a weapon makes it look and feel great\nGood variety in the existing levels\nPower-ups and Tests of Faith make for fun gameplay\nAnnouncer is entertaining\nPost-game free-for-all PvP round where you kill your teammates to get loot\nLooks surprisingly good\nMalleable difficulty- you can make this game very easy or extremely difficult through Difficulty options and Oaths (think the Gods in Bastion)\nNo crippling performance issues I know of\n\nCons:    There are only 5 maps. You could argue that, with different permutations of Oaths and Difficulties, you could extend the replay value more, but that's stretching it. Once you've played the same 5 maps over and over it gets stale\nGuns and appearance equipment locked behind level gate\nThe developers abandoned this game because they had to "work" on RIPD (read: do a light re-skin and ship), so any hopes of the game getting any future support or updates are just that- empty hopes\nBatman is NOT a playable character\nFinal Verdict-\nIf this is on sale for $2 like it is now, give it a shot.

This game is pretty middle of the road I'd say, if you only want to know an opinion outright I'd say it's worth buying if it's on sale and you have people who will play it with you.\n\nPros:\nThe concept of fighting your way through hell is pretty solid for a horde game.\nThe levels look pretty good and have a nice theme to them.\nThe different enemies make for interesting combat.\nTest of faith system does add some interesting effects, can make the round harder, easier, or not change much of anything, this could be a con for some because it's entirely random and praying to RNG gods tends to be frowned upon. That said I think the difficulty adjusts your chances of getting a good or bad one. Playing the easiest difficulty almost all of ours were good except one neutral one which gave all enemies hats and the last boss thing which switched it to some negative ones.\n\nCons:\nPersonally the game made Teamspeak very muffled, and the games' voip wasn't much better.\nThe limitations! There's character customization but it's the same 4-5 things with slight differences, for example there are only 5 different faces and then the rest of the options are those same faces with a different hat on or something.\nThere are only 5 levels.\nThe game is multiplayer, there is no single player, just playing multiplayer alone which can easily mean you get stomped.\nAs a game about fighting hordes of enemies I'm sure it'd easily get repeatative.\n\nAll in all the game has/had promise and really the limitations could've been solved if they'd allowed community content so you could download player made maps and models. I'd say it's a decent game for screwing around with your friends if it's on sale but full price is a bit much given it has so few maps and character options.","August 8, 2014","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All you do is run around gunning down zombies for exp and gold to unlock customization options with 3 of your friends.

Also the aiming is a bit rough, presumably because it is adapted from a console game. Other than that, it's a great game to play to just blow off steam and have a few laughs with mates. It's not a game you can take too seriously and have to really concentrate to play, so you can pretty much just mindlessly blast your way through hordes of the undead. It's not that exciting to play alone, in fact it's quite painful as the game doesn't scale when you play a map with 1 player or 4. The progression is kind of fun, you unlock new guns and upgrades every few levels so that does encourage a fair bit of replay value, but unfortunately there are only a handful of maps to actually play on so it does get repetitive. The repetition is broken up by little challenges that appear in each zone which do different things, sometimes giving you buffs like infinite ammo, or make it tougher by having 1 invincible enemy or turning friendly fire on.","November 27, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has a lot of potential. The game is definitely meant to be played with a group of people, and doesn't seem to scale down in difficulty. Even on the lowest difficulty, playing solo is just too hard. And the game's progression system is hard aswell. You need so much experience to level up in this game, it's not even funny. I'm sure with a group of able players you could probably keep playing for a long while and progress a lot faster.. But playing solo is just punishing in all ways possible.\n\nAnd why am I playing solo you might ask? Well, there's simply no matches to be found whenever I play. I can try to host a game, but no one seems to join. Either there's just not enough people playing this game, or the matchmaking is suffering from problems in regard of portforwarding etc. which is just sad.\n\nThe game looks good, feels alright and handles pretty decent with controllers. It's just too demanding and definitely not for the casual player. You've got to grind for hours and hours to progress even the slightest bit. And you pretty much have to progress if you're gonna go anywhere in this game, as you start with the lousiest set of weapons possible.\n\nI can't really recommend this title as it is right now, and I doubt the game's gonna change any time soon. It's been out for a fair bit of time now with little to no changes done to it. It's a shame, but it's probably just going to die out eventually. I give it a 5/10 only for the sheer potential it has, but it lacks oomph to it. and players.. and easier progression.. and balancing.. and.. ugh..","October 25, 2014","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It can be played with random ppl, or even alone, but when you know the folks you're fighting through the different Tests of Faith with, it's way more fun.\n\nJust a quick overview of the game: the characters are customizable to a point, but I wish there was more to it. There are primary and secondary weapons that you can purchase, with in-game currency, and the weapons are upgradable, which is wonderful, because you can definitely tell that the weapon has been upgraded after using it. The levels are progressive, and with every new area, you get a "Test of Faith", which is some random game type, like reduced health, or unlimited ammo, etc. The Tests of Faith do add some variety to the game, but they can easily make the current "level" much, much harder. There are "Oaths" that you can take, which are detrimental to your character, and increase the passive difficulty level, but in exchange, you get more gold and XP. The characters do get abilities, but I don't use them, since one of my Oaths is to have the ability permanently disabled.\n\nGoing on, switching from the characters to the game environment.

It would be nice if there were more enemy types, but since there isn't, the game makes up for it by just swarming you with enemies, and dying can happen in a second, or so. There are pickups that are scattered throughout the levels, like ammo and health pickups, which makes sense. One of the things I wish the game had, and maybe it does somewhere, is an in-game chat. Instead, I have to Shift+Tab into the Stream chat just to talk to the ppl I'm playing with. It's helpful to tell ppl that you have no ammo or life, and they can save you a health pickup or such, which in turn will further the success of the party. It doesn't really matter whether your party finishes the "Maze", which is a series of Tests of Faith; it's all about the gold and XP.\n\nLastly, the game in it's own sphere doesn't make any sense.

It's quite tough and extremely monotonous, but if you bring along a friend and you're willing to leave your brains at the door, there's a lot of fun to be had here. The game world is lovingly realized and the humour is rather campy, which is combined with gameplay-altering mutators known as "oaths" and "tests of faith" to create a distinctly silly, chaotic atmosphere.

I hope to see God Mode II or something and have the weapons to be more customization and perhaps some good melees. The other side is that it's hard to start up since the basic weapons are crap and a little hard to gain money especially in solo pay.

However, after modding my weapons a tiny bit and getting used to the bizarre control scheme, I really started to appreciate the intense atmosphere of the game. Whilst the game is unfriendly to newcomers, it is - no doubt about it - one of the most intense third person shooters that I have ever played. I particularly enjoyed the aspect of Greek mythology that was included in the game, though there were some elements that were incorrect. The soundtrack and atmosphere of the game really set the mood, and the random "Tests of Faith" sometimes had me laughing, and other times cringeing. The "Spirit Guide" can sometimes be a real pain to listen to, but otherwise he is genuinely amusing and likeable.\n\nWhilst this game gets quite a lot of negative reviews for being a mindless shooter, I think that this game is of great value for it's price, though would maybe recommend buying it when on sale. I feel sad that I can never find anyone to play the game with as well, as I think that it would be a lot more fun with friends. Overall, this game satisfied me after a few brief moments of frustration, and I think I will definitely continue to keep playing the game.","May 3, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the concept of riddling creatures from the Greek mythology with bullets. The graphics are decent and although the game only has a few levels some of them look gorgeous.\n\nThis is a typical multiplayer shooter: you fight against waves of enemies and the further you progress on the level the tougher encounters you have. Eventually, there is a boss but not every level has a final countdown in this form. You collect XP in order to level up and upon completion of a level you can pick up a lot of gold coins enabling you to purchase upgrades for your weapons and even to customise your character by buying various types of clothing.\n\nGod Mode is nothing special but the mythology here makes the shooter an interesting game albeit it still remains a bit mediocre.\n\nI do not recommend it for the same reason I did not recommend the two Sniper Elite Zombie Army games: finding a host is impossible! In fact, even if you are the host you can spend eons until someone joins. And do bear in mind that there is a community willing to play this game even 1 year after its release.\n\nSo, if you have friends who are just as eager to play this game as you are do team up with them and unleash your fury on titans, cyclops, skeletons and any other mythical creatures you encounter. Otherwise avoid it if you can.","May 6, 2014","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You need to earn experience and money to get the kind of equipment that you can win with. I'd really like a jumpstart on that process, but it is what it is.\n\nOne thing that seems like a mistake to me is that the weapons take a long time to reload while the game is fast paced and active - I found it really difficult to survive reloading your gun.\n\nIf you like a real challenge that you cannot beat first time through then get this.\nIf you get quickly frustrated with games that are too hard then do not play this game.","April 18, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One is that there is no local coop that would make the game so much better. Two is that it is a bit buggy not unplayable by any means. The only major issue I've had bug wise was during one of my runs the enemies glitched out and I wasn't able to finish the level and move on so I had to quit.

Tried fixes and workaround. Nada. I strongly advise against getting this game. Not even on sale like I did. Killing Floor is a game by Tripwire Interactive that delivers everything they promise and then some. And its cheap. This game might allow you to see the developer credits just to taunt you and let you know who just bagged over the head and suckerpunched you and made off with your money.\n\n10/10 would recommend to people looking to lose some cash into a totally broken game without any developer support.\nAs for the rest of you, avoid this godforsaken game. There are much better and working games out there. Killing Floor, Left for Dead, TF2, the list goes on and on. Avoid this PLEASE!!!!","January 20, 2014","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So naturally, you start with no super powers or even competent weapons.\nWeilding a short range SMG and shotgun, you have to fend off waves of minions with some minor bosses, in an arena that has a  'theme' - fog, sound distortion, meagre health regen, etc.\nIt doesn't help that most of the ranged mobs can have a crack at you from half the arena away, which means you have to wade in and clear the hordes of mobs, before you can even get close to the ranged mobs.\nTo make it even more endearing, you are constantly mocked by a overtly camp guide, whose cliched baritone voice had me switching the speakers off within a few minutes.\nCollision detection is so laughably large, you will get knocked off your feet by a charging foe, that is a good few feet to the side from you. Whilst you're down, you'll quickly be surrounded by mobs, that then hack you to death in seconds once you're back on your feet- no chance of fighting your way out because the weapons are absolute cr@p.\nRinse, repeat.\n\nMultiplayer is a non event, because no one else is stupid enough to play this game, so the game stays stuck in a constant search for someone, anyone to connect to.\nI am permanently embarrassed that I gifted this game to a friend before playing it. AI hope this review serves as a warning, for  anyone even considering getting it.

The worst offender on console was an enemy totally disappearing from the arena, making it impossible to complete the Test. I have had this happen to me a few times on PC as well; just look for hidden Harpies. The best glitch (if you're playing with someone) is their character model absolutely spazzing when you hit Gold Rush.\n\nI paid a combined $10 for the game both times; if multiplayer was more vibrant than a graveyard, one copy of God Mode could very well be worth the cost of the 4-Pack.\n\nNo more than a handful of everything – excepting (slightly dissimilar) customization options, sorts of enemies (not necessarily Types of enemies) and Tests of Faith (randomly generated 'objectives' given as you progress through each stage of the map - these are what make the game good; anything from the distortion of the sound, to the enemies wearing Party Hats, to Weapon Roullette, to brief stints of God Mode (invincibility) and about 40 others) - provided you don’t mind mindlessness, you will find much fun and entertainment to be had.\n\nTo be sure, avoiding the throngs of Hades takes a fully focused player – before you’ve acquired several (tens of) thousands of Gold, you won’t even be able to attempt a difficulty higher than Bronze; you’ll be lucky to have half your party survive Silver (should you be playing cooperatively). The mindlessness lies in the 5 maps.\nUnderstand that, with no bias from the PS3, on my pitiful ‘puter, the scenery is AWEsome; quite often I’ll find my completion times are indicative of a poor player. I was busy marveling at the sprawling Basilisk(?) statue, the punishing Tornado (which is really a hurricane in a vertically conical shape) and the… fire dungeon. Honestly, though, you can only play the same 5 maps so many times before it becomes (a little) monotonous. Still: the game is fun and I find it a crime that it didn't get a bigger player-base.\n\nAddressing gameplay: You have your standard weapons (the default SMG should be your go-to gun for a while) and then you’ve a few exotics: Plasma Pistol that shoots in an arc (great for crowd control), Buzzsaw that can both launch blades or be used in melee, Crossbow that shoots (multiple) flaming bolts, etc. Dodging is necessary and you will be appalled at how little it seems to help at times; you might be soothed in knowing that you CAN reload while sprinting. The default Ability, Shield, is decent, but Healing should be the priority (as it has an area-of-effect), and then Salvage for more loot; you can also call down Zeus' bolts or use a Hammer that makes Thor's seem useless.\n\nNo grenades, only one map in which native traps could help you, no sniper rifles (per se) or distractions from you as a target: you are on your own, whether actually soloing or not.\nThere is a gratuitous auto-aim function (you’ll be glad to have it), but the firing rate on the semi-auto weapons detracts from their power, unless you can line up several targets. To reiterate: SWARMS. The auto-aim is handy for the teleporting Mages and the poisonous Scarabs.\n\nAll-in-all: A surprisingly fun shooter that I can’t help but call (however loosely or shallowly) God of War with guns. I doubt that the dev’s could have done much better in the execution, with the exceptions of (more) advertising (to ensure at least a decent-sized multiplayer community), more maps and more bosses (with different mechanics to handle each):\nThe Queen Harpy is the hardest boss because sometimes you’re just screwed, there’s no escaping it's screech. The massive Monsters that are in and stay in the background are just begging to be destroyed; perhaps they could have implemented a sort of platforming/swinging battle to dispense with the fire beast that turns the cogs in the fire dungeon level.\nHowever, I honestly feel that asking for anything more from this title would just be greed on the players’ part. I can understand not wanting to pay full price for such a relatively sparse game with no one still playing it, but if you’re up for an arena game based in Greek mythology, you won't regret going God Mode.","September 22, 2014","true","53.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now I usually don't write detailed reviews, but I thought that I needed to get my opinion out there. This game, God Mode has a pretty interesting story. You are a descendant of a god that was banished from the heavens, and now to prove yourself worthy of becoming a god again, you must fight wave after wave of enemies set in a greek mythological world. Let's get into this.\nRight off the bat, there's no introduction. It pulls you up to a menu with options to create a match, join one, etc.\nI decided to create a match to test whether or not the game was actually fun.\nSo I spawned in with my SMG and double barrel and walked to where I thought was the destination I had to go to, as the game did not tell me where or how I was supposed to go.\nI get to the location and found myself surrounded in a wide open room of skeletons. Classic, I thought.\nShooting and moving being the only thing I knew how to do, I tried to survive. Any control tutorial was non-existent.\nAfter 30 seconds I was dead.\nI looked in the controls and found that sprint was space, melee was right click and ADS (aiming down sights) was E, not to mention that the sensitivity for the mouse was extremely high.\nAs an average PC gamer, I can confirm that those controls are completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nAfter changing them to my preferred buttons I continued the game, might I remind you that you have 3 lives and while I was changing these settings I was getting slaughtered without consent, listening to my character moan and bleed.\nWith one life left I managed to kill 10 skeletons and then get brutally ripped apart by a gigantic fat guy.\nIt wasn't pretty.\nI decided to restart the match and change up my tactics a little bit.\nAll I did was run around the map, firing a clip behind me then collecting ammo/meds and running again.\nAnd then when I had killed everything and was waiting to traverse to the next area, I found myself stuck.\nI saw that the problem was that there was skeleton archers atop a bridge far frome my reach. Trying to shoot them proved it to be nearly impossible without wasting every single bullet I had, as the accuracy on the SMG was absolute ****.\nAfter killing them I finally got to move to the next stage, which was pretty much the same thing with a slightly different layout. I died on that stage.\nDetermined to see what else this game had and to give it another shot I tried multiplayer, and to my surprise I actually found another player. Confused, lost and newby, but I found another player!\nWe played the same level I was having difficulty on and managed to get to the second to last stage.\nDuring each stage, there is a modifier that changes up gameplay, and the modifier switches upon getting to the next stage. Some are good and some are bad.\nDuring my gameplay with this other player on the second to last level, we got a modifier that was meant to be extremely OP, but in turn was a game breaker.\nEvery minute or so, one of the players would get a graphically pleasing and high-damage hammer of the gods, that after another minute would switch to the next player.\nBoth me and him found this hammer extremely under powered, as it hit slow as anything, and only one-hit the weakling skeletons that are usually a 5 shot with your ol' SMG, not to mention that you can't run with this hammer, making fighting harder, bigger, faster foes more difficult. The most difficult to fight was the ranged enemies, as they would run and strafe-fire at you, making fighting them with the hammer completely impossible.\nThat was the level we died on.\n\nI really think that the devs of this game, in the beginning of development, had everything going for them. A half-fresh game idea, lots of time, etc. But the direction they took it made the game absolutely horrid. To sum everything up, here are some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\nGreat graphics\nDecent level design\nNo pay-to-win\nLots of customization\n\nCons:\nDead matchmaking\nExtremely boring farm/grind\nExtremely difficult as a beginner\nBland weapons\nBland upgrades\nCustomization options are all the same with slight differences\n\nThank you for reading this! This was my first in-depth review! Please leave feedback","January 29, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was expecting a arena styled shooter with fast paced action and fun loot. Instead I was greeted with a no-tutorial, sluggih and uninspired snoozefest. Theres very little in the way of teaching the player anything, instead the game prefers to toss you in and quite literally laugh at you as you adapt. Advancement is painfully slow. The arena effects would be fun... On a harder mode, but on the first level tend to make it even more overecomplicated. The character moves VERY slowly, and spint (mapped to space, btw...?)  makes you unable to shoot and still doesn't really get you moving at all. The enemies seem straightforward, but will spawn from all over, making it impossible to not get hit, as there will always be one behind you. I haven't sunk alot of time into the game, as you can see, but I really don't think it could get any better, especially after looking at other reviews and scores. In my humble opinion, the 58/100 is a bit too lenient. Maybe in Coop the game shines a little better, or maybe after hour 20, but honestly, there aree other, much bettere games out there. Want run and gun fun with loot? Skip this, and play BL2. You won't look back at all.","March 24, 2014","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's quite tough and extremely monotonous, but if you bring along a friend and you're willing to leave your brains at the door, there's a lot of fun to be had here. The game world is lovingly realized and the humour is rather campy, which is combined with gameplay-altering mutators known as "oaths" and "tests of faith" to create a distinctly silly, chaotic atmosphere. Not exactly a good game, but a decent shooting experience, especially with a mate or two.","July 12, 2014","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love horde shooter like games and this game is great. Random effects are great. The only downside I've seen is the fact that the game has little to no customization for the weapons. I hope to see God Mode II or something and have the weapons to be more customization and perhaps some good melees. The other side is that it's hard to start up since the basic weapons are crap and a little hard to gain money especially in solo pay. The customizations as well are very expensive.","July 12, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the concept of riddling creatures from the Greek mythology with bullets. The graphics are decent and although the game only has a few levels some of them look gorgeous.\n\nThis is a typical multiplayer shooter: you fight against waves of enemies and the further you progress on the level the tougher encounters you have. Eventually, there is a boss but not every level has a final countdown in this form. You collect XP in order to level up and upon completion of a level you can pick up a lot of gold coins enabling you to purchase upgrades for your weapons and even to customise your character by buying various types of clothing.\n\nGod Mode is nothing special but the mythology here makes the shooter an interesting game albeit it still remains a bit mediocre.\n\nI do not recommend it for the same reason I did not recommend the two Sniper Elite Zombie Army games: finding a host is impossible! In fact, even if you are the host you can spend eons until someone joins. And do bear in mind that there is a community willing to play this game even 1 year after its release.\n\nSo, if you have friends who are just as eager to play this game as you are do team up with them and unleash your fury on titans, cyclops, skeletons and any other mythical creatures you encounter. Otherwise avoid it if you can.","May 6, 2014","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Then a third party thought it would have been great so tried to engineer what their child would have looked like if it took some elements from both and then filter out the best parts of either.\nThis is that what-could-have-been ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a child drew one afternoon: a quite lacklustre third-person, co-op arena shooter.\n\nThe first thing about this game youll dislike is the unlock system. It is awful. You start out with the worst pea shooters imaginable and require a huge chunk of XP (and gold) to unlock anything better, something only really manageable at that point by trying and failing at levels continuously. You can always upgrade stuff, but by the time you get your gun any good via this method you will be able to unlock the next gun - one which completely out ranks it.\n\nBut surely they couldnt ♥♥♥♥ up on the crazy "old school" run-and-gun they promised, right? Yes, well, they did. You do not move at any faster rate than an enemy, so circlestrafing isnt viable. Weapons are too conventional to give any possible alternate strategies and there is too little variation in enemies, not least in number but ability too.\n\nTheres a neat little twist in that at the end of every level you enter a bonus round which requires you to pick up gold that spawns, except friendly fire is on so you must fight to the death with your team that just helped you reach this room. While entertaining, this only elongates the aforementioned problem with the unlock system. If you solo a level entirely and reach this round you can expect to pick up around 15k at most. Now when we add in three other players all to vie for that it shrinks quite substantially. Considering anything worth having is nothing short of six figures, you can sort of see how much of a grind youre in for.\n\nIt IS a modern take on the arena shooter, which is about as bad as it sounds.","May 15, 2013","false","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I do expect to play this game more and more as my life permits.\n\nGod Mode is an arena styled creature shooter. The map is essentially an arena, with health, armor and ammo pickups. You start the match in a lmited area, and once cleared, are allowed access to the next area, not being able to turn back. It's fun in that every sub-area, there is an altar that provides a game modifier, whether it helps you or it helps the monsters. Nothing that completely screws you over, but gives the round that extra oomph. If you die too many times (I believe the number is 4), the game is over. You gain experience and gain occasional gold drops through killing monsters. The bigger the monster, the larger the experience payout. There is a nice variety of monsters and undead to kill, forcing you to analyze and figure out what to kill first. At the end of each of the "mazes" (maps), there is a boss. Nothing too overkill, but then again I'm playing on "Bronze" difficult (easy). Guns are upgradeable, so that when you lose a match, you can upgrade your arsenal and get further than you did before. It's a grind game. Lots of killing is require to level up, plus guns and upgrades cost a fortune. After nearly an hour and a half, I amassed around 20,000 gold, just to be met with the first gun upgrades costing 10,000 each.\n\nThe only real downside I have found so far is that Matchmaking is nearly impossible. I sat in the automated matchmaking screen for a good 10 minutes, just to have two people pop in, who left within 10 seconds. You're going to play solo unless you pair up with your friends. There are other flaws in this game that don't really bother me, but honestly you have to go in with no expectation for this game. Just anticipate that you'll have fun shooting and killing a lot of monsters.\n\nTL;DR: Fun game, worth the $3 I paid. It's a grind game. Limited maps, impossible matchmaking.

Sure, it's an epic grind fest where all you do is kill enemies upon enemies in 5 different locations. Of course this would be torture if you are to play this game for a couple of hours at a stretch. However if you hunger for challenge, and that without having to put much stress to your brains - This is the game for you. This game is perfect if you enjoy taking breaks between 2 good games by playing short round/level based games like Tetris, Street Fighter, Pac Man, etc. This is just customized for masochistic gamers. However this game does have some fun elements to it, if you don't look at it as a resource for tedium. There are plenty of customizations, weapons and enemy types. The in-game modifiers or the so called "Tests of Faith" do bring some excitement to the gameplay. The graphics are decent and the game is set around Ancient Greek Mythology which brings in some diversity. Overall not a must buy, but if you want to throw away a few bucks and can't think of anything better, buy it.","July 1, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, after a few games in I was pretty shocked at how I was not enjoying it at all. Not even slightly.\n\nAt first glance, it has potential. Waves of enemies with different stages and modifiers that are constantly changing. Giving you a pretty good 3rd person shooter challenge. You can 'customise' your characters look and change their 2 guns. You level up and get money during games to buy these upgrades with.\n\nGod Mode fails in the areas which seem like they should be positives. The Gameplay is extremely repetetive. What would you expect from a wave mode game? Well I expected something. The enemies just seem to run at you from start to finish so it just becomes a game of running in a circle shooting behind you. There is a sprint and a roll but both of those get you nowhere fast so they're pointless to use.\nThe 'customisable' character is actually not very customisable. There are about 5 options. and then there are variations of those options. So you'll have a zombie or a clown and then after the next level you'll unlock a pirate zombie and a pirate clown. All thats been added is a pretty unimaginitve hat.\n\nLastly, the levelling is the longest grind Iv'e ever seen for a game with such limited gameplay. With an mmo you would expect a long grind because there are so many things to do, with a game that has 5 stages which are all offer the same wave mode gameplay, you would think the grind would be a bit more forgiving.... It's not.\n\nGOD MODE - 3 / 10","September 7, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
