Your little guys are ants, and you're nudging them to build, harvest, and survive in the best of ways.\n\nThe game itself is a simple gods-eye view game where you take charge through basic orders. Shows quite a bit of promise for the future and honestly it's really easy to just get lost time-wise while playing. I can't wait to see what happens with this game down the line but you better believe I'm going to be watching for a long time.","October 27, 2014","true","13.6"," 65 of 78 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","65","78","0","0"

It only had 3 or so ressources, awkward villager management and not many things to build. I was constantly overrun by zombies, there was little balancing.\n\nNow that I´m writing this reviewOver the past weeks the game has been updated on a regular basis, bugs fixed and content added. The community is being involved in the developement process.\nThe game has a much more differentiated interface and villager statistics. A ressource refinement system has been added, the magic ressource 'crystal' is now usable and powers some of your buildings. The balancing has improved a lot in a way that you actually have a chance to survive. Monsters have been added and others balanced. Most of the ressources are renewable now. You can already call it a game at this point, it is playable up to end-game without major disruptions in the gameplay.\n\nWhat to expect from this gameYou get an indie survival game with tower defense as well as rpg elements. Build up your medieval fantasy village and try to survive the neverending undead onslaught.\n\nStill being early access, the game has a lot of potential to go in many directions.\nMore towers could be added, like electric or acid, dealing splash/aoe damage, or to target specific monsters with weaknesses to certain damage types.\nA crafting system could be added to bring out the rpg side, allowing armor and weapons, or a profession system like warriors, mages, archers.\n\nWhat I´d really like to see are more maps. Maybe a community map contest?\n\nPricingAt the current stage, being in early access, I find the price a bit high, since the user doesn´t get the finished game yet. In my opinion early access games should reward buying it/taking the risk in this stage.\nIf the game continues on it´s path the price will be justified for the final release.","April 15, 2015","true","52.3"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","26","27","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vhazen/recommended/328080/","Vhazen","Queen Chrysalis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vhazen/","342 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA magnificent attention to detail went into the textures for this game! With several variations for each object or tile, nothing in the map looks quite like the copy-and-paste wireframe you usually expect to see in other 2D pixel games. Down to the last blade of grass, there seems to be a nice variety of different shades, shapes and directions each individual block displays - with every texture having a decorative secondary layer for its own material type. Complementing the game's surprisingly vibrant and lively textures is an amazing, hand-crafted lighting system ruled over by some of the other textures and objects, and a fully functional day-and-night cycle. Torches provide a light source, lava illuminates a small radius of land around it, and crystals glow in the dark like fireflies. Every wall and object has a dynamic and intricate reaction to which direction the sun is in relation to the world below (as well as other light sources), which changes gradually as the day cycle goes by. Even the water shines in the night as the moon reflects down on it!\n\nWhile this may not sound like much to most modern gamers, for a pixel-based game, the way this is handled is extremely impressive, and adds a clever illusion of 3D with a very nice shadow system. Even some of the world textures are crafted with certain curves around the edges and changes of width that add a realistic sense of direction and angle. This is most visible in the game's own main menu, with the stone-brick wall trim which boxes us in the game's window.\n\nThe game currently is still in a very early alpha stage and offers no enemies or immediate dangers beyond the starvation of your villagers who wander around aimlessly like hilarious morons until you lay out the foundation for a town hall and send out vague and indirect orders for different resources - a feature true to its own advertisement. This game is definitely no standard RTS, as you have much less control over what happens within the world, instead treating the villagers like ants in an antfarm. You give them basic instructions and a general goal in life, and they immediately begin deciding amongst themselves who works where and who gathers or builds what.\n\nVillagers marry and house themselves independently (assuming there had already been homes built, by your command) and have their own unique set of attributes such as Strength and Dexterity, which increase depending on how hard they work or how long they travel. If they are over-worked or if a spouse dies, a villager will become extremely depressed, and lose the will and the energy to continue working at full capacity for a short period of time. Eventually, the villager will find relief in rest or another lover, and so will continue on with his or her life.\n\nThe lack of direct control over your villagers is a very welcome and unique change of flow from your average city-building sim, as it gives you a very relaxed and non-competitive or war-driven experience. While I'm sure more threats will be introduced further down the line, the general concept of the game so far is very interesting and humble. I personally have never seen a game concept quite like this, and despite my lack of interest in pixel-based games, I found this quite enjoyable. Even with its current lack of content.\n\nThis is still a very early build, with a lot of features and content to be added as time goes by. As for right now though, in the state it's in at the time, it comes with a refreshing breath of life in the world of sandbox sims.  Where other games force linear and challenging objectives  or goals, this game's only real objective is survival, and determining how to best accomplish this, with strategy. The gameplay itself reminds me somewhat of Lemmings and Black & White, two gems from Lionhead Studios and Team17. One an objective-based RTS sim where you give general orders to minions in order to help them escape a maze, and the other a god-game where you do your best to keep a strong and stable economy and gain control over other villages. All in all, Retro-Pixel Castles comes with an /exceptionally/ nice soundtrack which really helps set the mood and clear the mind, and a surprising amount of detail and clarity in its world textures which promises a great deal of polish in the final product. The lighting and 3D-like illusions shown in 2D textures makes the game almost remind me a little of Don't Starve, with its ability to turn a simple 2D world into something more like a pop-out storybook. To know that all this comes from such a small dev team is very thrilling, and I would definitely like to see what direction this project takes in the future.\n\n\n","October 28, 2014","true","3.9"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","28","34","0","0"

(especially since the 16x16 update)\nLittle bugs, and all that are found usually resvolved, good or bad, ray helps.\nDRM Free\nAn also nice selection of enemies, and jobs, adds a good bit of depth.\nRecent changes to the way things work has made the game a lot better IMO.\nThe new towers for defense have greatly improved playablity.\nRay's got some strange talent at making maps, and lots of them too, plus they all last ages so that's a good bit of fun.\n\nMost of the cons are minor, may not look that way by the amount of text but that's just cause of my choice of wording.\n\nCons:\nThe game is more-that-slightly-less-than-rather intensive, but that's not bad coding, it's just the particles are everywhere.\nNo undo/redo in map editor, Most likely will be changed.\nCan't rotate in map editor. Not sure if it will be changed because that might be on purpose.\nWinter is perhaps a bit too hard to survive late game, but i've only gone into it once since the update.\nThe AI can be a little stupid, like often when i put enemies in forests they broke their way our, causing wood to drop on the floor and that was miles away, my people then go to pick it up. But, gernally the AI pretty good.\n\nOverall rating: 8/10\n\nAlright, that's all for now, join me next time on this steam reviews to find out if weight loss is a lie.","August 30, 2015","true","48.1"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","0"

(2/1/2015 - Current Ver: Indev12c, Indev13 roadmap announced)\n\nI'm recommending this, but I have a few caveats before I get to my review. If you're expecting a game that is 100% or even 80% realized as of (2/1/2015) then you probably haven't had much experience with Early Access and you probably shouldn't buy this game YET. Or if the feedback-and-support thing doesn't appeal to you, the $15 pricetag might seem a bit steep. Even then, if you're afraid of vaporware (I know I am), read the store page thoroughly as Ray (the dev) has done his best to put your fears to rest. Still mistrusting? I'm here for ya, or go to the website (or any of the links provided on the store page) and form your own opinion Official Website[retropixelcastles.com](main website link on store page seems to be broken). I know it's some extra effort than you would normally spend, but Ray is very active on his official forums and he will certainly answer any questions regarding his vision and the current state of development before you make a decision on purchasing.\n\nThat said, I feel with the risk of vaporware and rushed products, opinion on the dev in an Early Access review is just as important as the game itself and I'll address that with my opinion first. If you don't care, scroll down and read the game portion. I'll remove this once the game goes Full-Access.\n\nReview of Indie Developer Raymond Doerr(scroll down for game review)\n\nThis man has earned my respect among a slew of Indie "Developers" (Opportunists) that started with Minecraft (Jeb had made a lot of promises like our Alpha/Beta contributions entitling us to free Xbox copies before it was so popular -- didn't happen) and continues to this day with practically every Early Access game on Steam. So much so I've learned to type the simple little word "dev" with a bit of spite in my mental voice. Ray is not that man. While this is an opinion, and one I cannot garuntee in the future, I very strongly feel this way. Just talk to him, you'll see.\n\nLittle things like his naming of his updates Indev12-13 versus 0.12.02 (this is no race to the magic 1.0! it's just a progress report) to his efforts to ask/require your input and support when so many people are so rightfully afraid to give it through an otherwise legitimate manner set him apart.\n\nWhen I was younger, Independently-Developed games were practically non-existent. To be a Beta Tester, you had to send in a resume to a big name company and you had to be hired, it was a job, before your voice ever mattered in the gaming world. I have a job so that's not an option, but through Ray and his SixtyGig Games (and with $15) my voice is heard. That is what Early Access, Independently-Developed games, and Raymond Doerr is all about.\n\n(had to be cut short for the actual game review, the lengthy praise is warranted though, I f-ing hate vaporware and the only way around it are honest reviews)\n\nReview of Retro-Pixel CastlesCurrent Version: Indev12c\n(Pro/Con lists are not my style, hope you like to read)\n\nInfluences\nOn the Steam Store Page, the game is marked as having several noticable influences, but in its current version, I mainly  agree with three of them, and I'll try to break them down.\n\nDwarf Fortress: This is the most obvious influence in my opinion (and also the closest game to ever touch upon what I want in a DF-like game), You have practically zero control over your villagers. You can place buildings to be constructed when your villagers get to it (although in a generally predictable manner), set resource harvesting tasks, and assign free (random) villagers to work at certain buildings. That's about it for control right now, and where most of the DF influence stops. P.S. "Losing is Fun!" theme is well-intact in Retro-Pixel Castles.\n\nBanished: You start the game on whatever map you choose with nothing but a bunch of villagers and are free to choose where you place your Village Center (required before you can build anything else and serves as radial zone for where you can place other buildings at first, so choose wisely!), unless someone (or you!) has made a map where the Village Center was already placed (you only get one, this ain't no 4x). Also, when you build your first farm, you have to collect wild food (carrots only, so far) before they can start growing them in the farm (this is a one-time deal, a working farm can populate a new one). While it is ultimately a village sim and has buildings, food/energy requirements, I'd end the tracable influences to Banished there.\n\nTower Defense: This is a big one, as it encompasses the actual challenge of the game. I spend most of my time on Peaceful, because I'm a casual grow-and-love city builder type gamer, but this is one of the rare few games where I'll switch off peaceful and play the regular game because A) Peaceful at this stage is -super- low on content and extremely easy being locked on Day 1 difficulty (you really only need/will ever use 2-4 of the available building types) B) Instead of devoting my city to raising a military, in Tower Defense style, your buildings do most of the work for you (your villagers will fight mobs, dumbly, and you will lose a lot of them, but that's the point! "Losing is Fun!"). Also, currently, you get to have one save, per mode, per map, per profile (you really only need one profile, unless you have a family or RL friends -scoff-) so I can come back to my peaceful cities when I want. So far (more buildings planned in the next update, expect this to change), the only offensive building is a Fire Tower (you can also build walls for defense/mob funneling) which will TD-style automatically fire at mobs close enough. All living things die in a burst of pixelated blood and green "essence" which serves as mana/power for your Fire Tower (and an Essence Collector, which is essentially a battery for the Fire Tower). Every day that you survive, the rate that mobs appear increases, and so the difficulty.\n\nMost of the game and its mechanics are covered above.\n\nAtmosphere:\nPixels!: At this point, you either love pixel-art or hate it. If you love it, this game does it very well. There's even an option to smooth out some of the pixel animation like essence flowing to an Essence Collector/Fire Tower(which looks gorgeous and well-fantasy-themed even for pixels), but I like pixels so I haven't even bothered. I'll edit this next time I go into the game and look (which may not be til the next update).\n\nMusic/Sound: Music is a nice, calming fantasy-like tune that fits well into the pixel-art world. I've never had to turn it down or off after several hours, but that's really all I have to say about it, as I tend to not notice game music anyways. Sounds come mainly from birth/death of villagers and are just a quick happy or sad tune that fits with the music-style.\n\nMaps:\nYou can make your own maps! Saved in whatever, and however many, folders you'd like. Ray is currently not very focused on (or very impressive at - sorry man) making maps for the game himself, which brings me to a special point.\nIf you buy Early Access and you make a good map and post it on his forum, Ray may add your map to the game before final release! This is, as far as it stands now, an Early-Access-Only feature. I've seen those threads pop up, and I've seen maps get added, and updated. Be a real contributor to the game!\nMaps are 1-z level (no digging down DF fans, these are humans!) but give a vague impression of depth as dense resources appear "taller" than their regular counterparts and is a nice touch to the aesthetic without complicated mechanics needed.\nCurrently, Ray is experimenting with map size in an effort to reduce code/program efficiency, so if you get in now, there might be changes.","February 2, 2015","true","20.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","8"

In short, you can't win...though you can learn from your mistakes and see how long you can last the next time out.  It's got a while before release (a year or more), so there's still a lot of work to be done.  I myself see a lot of potential here, though it's all very basic right now.  The lack of a save feature is probably my biggest gripe with the current build, though a fast-forward button would admittedly be nice too.  Still, you can browse the Internet and the like while you play as it is able to run in the background.

I beleive this game has great potential. To select an area for harvesting you use a sort of paint brush system changing the thickness and shape of the brush and simple "paint" an area to be selected to harvest. I found this system strangely enjoyable. Workers at the start work as a giant collective until you start to produce more building to seperate them with jobs. Your people have relationships and gain skills based on the work they have done and I found the short time I spent with this game simply great.\nI will update this review once I've played a decent amount of time on the latest release.\nI will also be looking into making some videos on this game now it is released to steam.\nI have one video currently avilable from Retro-Pixel Castles Tech demo here - http://youtu.be/NEk0M0PmJa4","October 27, 2014","true","0.2"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","24","33","0","0"

Like other tribes trying to kill my people or simply wild animals. Banished couldnt fulfill this wish but Retro Pixel Castles does. Although till now it is limited to Slimes and Zombies (more to come).\nObviously it is Early Access and not finished, it is in many ways very barebone, has at the moment no saving function (end 2014) and misses many other things in terms of controls, layout and look.\nBut it also is very playable i have to say. There is something you can get out and giving you some fun. Maps are available from the developer (although they are a bit ugly) or you get a community created map (looking much better).\nSteamworkshop is missing till now, which makes these a bit "harder" to obtain, but they are there.\n\nThe game goes a similar direction Banished goes. You start with a bunch of people, you create a Towncenter, harvest ressources and build other buildings to support your people or get defenses against Monsters up.\nYou cant control your people directly, which often is a bit painful because you also cant give other commands like a rallye point or make a priority to a building, so you cant influence till now which building they start to build or where they shall group up to fight and defend their town. Also a more direct control over single townsmen/women would be a good addition to decide who is going to be a builder and who will be a farmer (or maybe a guard later on?).\n\nBut even while there are things missing and flaws at the moment, it is very fun to play. Different maps give a good feeling of what the Dev can come up with and besides that spice the experience up. Playing on one map is very different than on the next one. Even playing several times on the same map is a variety in experience because the starting points are randomized.\n\nCurrently in:\n-are different basic buildings like a farm, different kinds of housing (tent and house), lighting, defensetowers, walls, structures to earn ressources\n-a mapeditor to create your own maps (is kinda easy, just the dev is doing some very ugly ones)\n-different profile without any use at the moment\n-a settings option menu\n-2 types of monsters (zombie and slime)\n-1 type of food\n-2 types of usable ressources (stone and wood)\n-3 types of non usable ressources at the moment (3 different crystaltypes)\n-a kinda good soundtrack (sounds very pixely)\n-a very sweet pixel look, zoomable camera (although a bit clunky in performance then)\n\nNote: you can enter a beta branch with going to properties of the game, which gives you access to a "unstable" version of the game with more features. I highly recommend  to do this, i experienced no crashes on the unstable compared to the basic version which crashed often and got more content from it.\nHow to do this is described on the forum.\nMy review is based of the Unstable Version 2 InDev12 on the Beta Branch.\n\nI can recommend this game as an early access game. Even unfinished it is very playable and has enough content to get fun out of it and be creative with the editor to get even more challenge or just experiment.\nI bought it for 7.49€ and i think it was worth the price. I think 15€ are a bit much for the content at the moment and if you want to wait till it gets cheaper or has more content, then wait.\nBut i think it will definetely be worth this price tag with a bit more content or even when its finished and for an Early Access Game, it delivers more than others do.\nIts one of the good Early Access Games.","December 29, 2014","true","22.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","1"

The problem is, it really is an early access game, means, the automaticely moving villagers sometimes dont finish buildings, which can mean you will lose in the coming next 10 minutes. In my situation it didnt finish the crystal farm which is necessary to finish turrets and also the energy generators to power the turrets. To just build a second farm you wont have enough time.

My problems with this game comes down to\n\n- Terrible "village management"\n- Sketchy bussiness practice, not necessarily malignant, but the dev is inexperienced and it shows\n- Lack of direction\n- There is no way to make interesting maps (All current ones are garbage)\n- Even at 10€ the game is heavily overpriced\n\nI don't want to go into little bugs and irritants, although they are not in short supply, this is early access and these are expected, but the above problems aren't something you can fix with a little patch, they require major reworkings of the game or the way the development operates.\n\nBy far the biggest issue here is the way new villagers are aquired; the game borrows the double dumbass approach of towns where you will only reproduce if your people are happy AND your people will only be happy if they aren't doing anything. I really didn't want to add this sentence but if you look in the comments for this review it's obvious i'm going to get called on it if i don't so yes, technically you CAN aquire new citizens even at 0 happiness, but the odds of that happening are so abysmally low, i've played 4 games now and i've seen 1 new person appear at <25 happiness, so it doesn't matter.\n\nThis is made far worse by the game's approach to combat. I expect combat to change a lot as new features are planned for it, but it is still taking the approach of high volatility combat; you're going to lose people defending your home. Compare this to Towns and Dwarf Fortress; in towns you also have this stupid villager approach to population growth, but you're very unlikely to lose people in combat, so it doesn't completely shut down your village even if you're frequently in combat. Dwarf fortress has frequent, massive genocides with scores of dead characters, but population growth is tied to the value of all items your fort owns, and looting enemies gives you lots of weapons, armor and clothes of good value, so you typically get lots of new migrants coming in to refill the ranks of your military.\n\nThis game has you attacked about every 30 seconds right now, there is practically no breathing room, and it starts immediately. The game seems more like an RTS than a village sim, but with an extremely slow process of replenishing your forces. This could work in the same ways as custom maps for starcraft and warcraft have done, which was awesome, but when you can't expand your population you're just stuck, unable to do anything.\n\nTying happiness to idling is another total failure for the game, especially with the constant aggression. You basically turn the whole game into ballancing workload vs free time; too little workload and you won't be able to build the defenses, too much workload and you never get enough people. This could work as a component to the game, but it just becomes the sole focus, and all you end up doing is unassigning and reassigning people in a neverending circle of tedius micromanagement.\n\nSpeaking of tedius micromanagement, the villagers are terrible at carrying out tasks efficiently. If you order too many houses/defenses/farms (read: more than 2) they'll start building the first house, then when it's halfway done, they apparently switch to the next, with just a few people working on the first. The result is a collage of unfinished structures littering your town, and if you're building defenses while they're being attacked, the builders will drop their materials to fight, then carry them of to the wrong building, leaving a single unfinished tower for up to 20 minutes was the worst i had, with the little idiots running back to pick up their wood, then drop it as a zombie got close, run over to punch the zombie, then pick up the wood and haul it to another tower under construction. (I queued 4 towers, silly me)\n\nThis isn't really a big issue to work around, just don't queue up constructions, right? Sure, but this is more micromanagement on top of giving builders their mandatory vacation time, and on top of the next issue:\n\nVillagers apparently gather resources from completely random places. This means if you're building something in one place and you assign them to gather wood/rocks nearby, they'll gather it there, but if you then build the next building somewhere else (Why would anyone want to keep their farms and defenses seperate...?) you have to unassign where to gather resources, or the idiots will run halfway across the map to chop down a tree, instead of the one assigned right next to them.\n\nAll this combined means you don't spend your time organizing defenses, planning your town or anything you'd expect from this game, you're just babysitting these idiotic villagers; go chop here, don't chop there, don't be a builder, don't mine there, mine here, be a builder, don't be a farmer, etc. etc. and this is what the game is; it takes hours to build anything because of this nonsense, and you need to leave the game running without building anything to get new villagers.\n\nThe other major issue with this as a village sim is that there are no different resources; just food and construction materials. Wood and stone are just different colours; no buildings/tools/tech needed for extraction, take the same time, trees don't regrow, what's the point?\n\nThe game's bussiness practice also smells bad. The game was initially kickstarted successfully, and IMMEDIATELY after that it was dumped on early access, despite being nothing more than an abysmal tech demo; no combat, just farms and houses forever; 30 minutes and the game ran out of things to do. My problem with this is how eager the dev is for cash. Why wasn't the kickstarter enough to at least make a functional game before throwing it out here? He'll happily charge full price for a tech demo, and the "game" has even been on sale. I hate old sayings, but "Don't sell the skin before shooting the bear" seems apt for once.\n\nThe other problem the dev has is the game's lack of focus. This game is NOT on early access to get feedback, because there are so many features missing it's practically impossible to give any worthwhile feedback. What the dev seems to want is ideas for where to take his game, and early access is a terrible place for that. Maybe you want a village sim and this turns into an RTS? Well then, jokes on you. It's impossible to satisfy everyone, but you're still charging them for it. Like i wrote at first, the game has elements of an RTS and a village sim as the dev advertises both on the store page and here: http://retropixelcastles.com/index.php?/page/key_features.html but they don't work together. You can't have the volatility of an RTS combined with the slow growth of a village sim; one has to dominate. The game also touts this "inevitable failure" part, as if it has any benefit; If you're building a village you want to see it grow and expand; what's the point of that if the village doesn't matter and you're just playing for high score? I don't mind the "see how long you can last" thing, but its fun in an RTS, where you build things only because of their immediate value to your survival, not in a village sim.\n\nApparently we're supposed to unlock stuff after we die, because grinding for necessary unlocks is everyone's favorite thing about videogames.\n\nThe game also claims to be "unique" which is nonsense; stronghold and majesty has done "defend and grow village" over a decade ago, and MUCH better.\n\nTL;DR: This is an RTS where all you can build is farms, houses and towers, and you can't control or replenish your units.","October 27, 2014","false","13.7"," 143 of 250 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","143","250","6","33"

I don't even like it.\n\nThere's just not much game here. All buildings seem to be lackluster and blatantly 2-tier right up front. Little is hidden. Want wood? Lumber jack or advanced lumberjack. Want stone? mason or advanced Mason. The buildings are rather bland and show little innovation or setting/theme.\n\nBasically you set your people to work by painting resource gathering areas on trees, stone, etc. Then you construct buildings to process these resources so you can make a defense tower or two and some magic makers.\n\nYou have a set of spells, once again all presented up front with little in the way of unlocking or earning their acquisition. Fireball for killing. Healing aura for ... healing. You can guess the rest. You've seen them in just about every other god-game.\n\nMy point is, re-hashing all the tired old god-game concepts from the 90's to now in a cute little pixel style doesn't show much originality and doesn't necessarily make the game fun. Grinding through several hours of this in attempt to enjoy it I finally realized, this simply is not a fun game yet.\n\nI hope, sincerely, to update this review later upon release, praising it for it's clever spell set, tiered growth and scaling, intense combat mechanics creative buildings, hearty and lore-filled setting and my attachment to the characters I'm leading. Right now it just has none of these features.","October 30, 2015","false","2.5"," 37 of 59 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","37","59","0","13"

Not to say I didn't enjoy it, it's just a very slow game. No time speed ups so get used to normal game time all the time. The game is enjoyable, but nothing that would keep you on constantly. This is something you can best play while writing a paper or cleaning your room. "You guys go this, and I'm gonna read /pol/ posts until you make a ding" Was pretty much the game plan. A couple time's I took a nap and woke up with doubled population (and one time when everyone just starved to death)\n\nA lot of the god powers are pretty useless depending on which play mode you play (Survival or Peaceful). Like in survival, I found the only useful tool was the pickup button. When ever a hoard would come I woild pick off one by one and toss them on the other side of the map.\n\nAt first I would keep checking the Alerts button to see what I can do to help my people, but after a while it became something to be ignored. A lot of problems that I faced I can do nothing about.\n>"So n' so is on fire"\n>Picks up person and puts in water.\n>He walks out and keeps being too hot.\n\nAlso, and this is my big problem/ reason for writing this: In peaceful mode I got my pop up to about 230 and now whenever I load up the game and open that map the game crashes. Before when I was at a pop of like 190 I noticed things got laggy, then I feel asleep again, woke up, turned the game off (saved and all) and now I cannot get back into my file.\n\nI checked out the whats next on 1.9 and all, roads can wait. Games like these gave to have a large pop cap on them, it's the whole point in doing a game like this. The goal and over all satasfiaction with something like this is seeing that your once 32 pop village a now 320 pop city!\n\nOverall, it's a fun game and I'm really looking forward for future development.

However, it IS an Early Access game, and there are of course some issues in gameplay balance and other areas, namely in how unreasonably difficult the game can be to control. The 2 games I can most relate to are Banished, and Dwarf Fortress - though it clearly distinguishes itself from both of these.\n\nThe game itself is very challenging on its own terms, in a way that inspires you to continue learning and strategizing despite many failed attempts. The gameplay is very fluid (though the framerate sometimes isn't) and is structured very intuitively.\nMy other thoughts on this game so far are as follows:\n\n+I love what there is of the soundtrack so far, somewhat reminds me of Runescape.\n+Love the interactive Main menu\n+The visuals of the game are so crisp and well designed, but I wish you could zoom out a little more, and zooming in as much as is available just hurts my eyes.\n+Lots of variety in maps so far, but I wonder if there will be more - or even procedural generation.\n+The map editor is excellent.\n-----------\n-It would make sense to lower temperature in rain and at night, and to let seasons affect gameplay differently depending on the area climate (ex. summer is hotter in the desert, not as bad in the tundra or mild areas)\n-The villager info panel needs to be better. When looking at the only panel that lists all villagers, I can't tell hardly anything about any of them besides their level. Seeing any other information about them on that panel would be incrediblly useful, as would be the ability to sort them differently or click their names as links in alerts.\n-Children (though they are agood game mechanic) currently make understanding your population difficult.\n-Some god powers are difficult and/or confusing to use.\n-It is very difficult and frustrating to attempt to navigate combat, or any other situation where a large amount of villagers and/or other creatures are stacked on top of one another - it's so hard to have an actual grasp on how the fighting is going, or if a villager needs healing because you it's so difficult to select them in the chaos.\n-I really wish I there was an option to disable the screen shaking so constantly.\n-----------\nThat's all I've thought up for now, but I'll try and keep this relatively updated.","May 24","true","6.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I'm getting my butt kicked a little - but not unfairly so. I can survive a few nights, and my mistakes have always been overreaching, trying to build something or harvest something too far out. I suspect I need to wall myself in, and funnel the zombies to a well defended hole before expanding... something I will try in coming days. The steady challenge I wanted is certainly there now, so, still recommended, and more so now than before. I'll update (if I remember) when I've played some more/with future updates.\n\n17 Dec 2014 : There's very little to do here, but everything that can be done is roughly in balance, and is "easy" to do, which is very good.  Right now there's no "ongoing" challenge - in many games of this genre, growth brings new problems (or revisitations of the old). I'm extremely interested to see how that will go, as everything here so far is rock solid and ongoing steady challenge is the only "thing" that prevents this becoming a time consuming pastime. I assume this will come in the form of ever more challenging waves of monsters... how this is balanced will probably be the make or break point for me. A tentative recommendation, let's see how things go!","December 17, 2014","true","10.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Just see how your villagers work by themselves, listen to the gorgeus music, watch the beatiful drawn map... Or, you can play in survival mode and focus on zombies not getting to your village!\n\nAlso, you have access to updates, with a lot of content in each of them. That's what I love of the game. I can be playing hours and hours without getting bored, and because of the updates, I get to play with new features.\n\nAnother thing I love about the game, is the game modes: skirmish and world map. You can play the classic skirmish, where you play in one map, or you can play in the world map, where you get access to a world with different maps. In world map mode, you have access to the limbo, where you can store villagers and resources. The game also features a tip system, magic towers, resource gathering... And the main purpose of survival mode: defending your village from the monsters and keeping your villagers alive (Or watching your willagers harvesting food in peaceful mode...)\n\nI guarantee you won't get bored with this game, and I recommend buying it. You should also buy the soundtrack. It's fantastic.","March 31","true","74.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

No mercy but fair in its progression, the developer has been nothing short of a welcome from early access titles.\n\nThis game went from simple mechanics but with an intuitive UI, limited of course; but throughout its development, more is added, fixed, and updated for better.\n\nI purchased this game  some years ago now, and I'm still smiling when I play.\n\nGive this game a go, it's worth your time.\n\n[EDIT] Came in to make a couple changes to the review\n\nThis is being written towards the end of January and I have to say this game has done incredibly well in regards to the development and additions it never had way back in June when I first wrote this small review.\n\nThe game has a rather difficult learning curve, but once you get into the idea that slower builds, resourse gathering and making informed decisions on village center placements, the game becomes much more enjoyable.\n\nThe audio is still lacking and the "events" that happen are so barely visible I rarely know when someone is born other than by audio cue.  Same goes for death.\n\nI'd like the music's tone to change during an upcoming attack, to get my ready...or maybe a visual notification such as, "Reports claim a gathering of monsters was making its way towards our camp..."\n\nStill an amazing game for the price.\n\n**********\n\nWell, I wasn't expectng this.\n\nThis game, in its current state, is just fantastic.\n\nI want to see more music, better implementation of some early-stage mechanics and am excited to see the new stuff down the road.\n\nPick this up if you are a Gnomoria fan or felt like Towns was missing something.","June 11, 2015","true","27.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","4"

Around day 7 things are going south fast. The game looks very promising, I have played, and failed repeatedly, I continue to enjoy seeing my own demise. Energy seems to be my biggest issue, You generate it extremely slowly farming crystals, and from enemy kills, but the difference between what you make and what it costs to kill a mob is considerable. I think that could use some balancing and maybe energy generation methods, I spammed the only building that is capable of producing power and even that didn't do the trick, they just run out so quickly. So all in all, I like the game, I think it will continue to get better as the Devs put more work into it. It plays like Gnomoria accept it's all above ground and you can't use the surroundings to protect yourelf (mobs hack through trees), However you have god powers and can interfere with what is going on to some extent, you can warp villiagers to safety or mobs away, but these are extremely expensive "influence" wise, this is the games form of mana, which is generated based on happiness. Fireballs are great, accept when you throw them into crowds of your villiagers because you panic when a hoarde of mobs get in... RIP 1st village.\n\nTLDR: Still in development, needs work, I still reccomend it.\n\n10/10 Would fireball my own settlement again.","January 10","true","6.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I won it as part of Malletspace Studios giveaway. But, I've ended up buying this game for friends, because I want them to be part of the fun of watching this game grow. Now, here's how I've come to enjoy the game,\n\nI watche KingdomGnark play the game on the YouTube Malletspace Studios channel. It was still in very early stages (and still is, a bit) at the time, but it looked like a lot of fun. At the end of each episode of his plays, he advertised a giveaway on twitter. I participated and won.\n\nWhen I received the key for the game, I started playing, and I got very excited. It's a real-time strategy game, all about building a village that will survive the onslaught of zombies, skeletons, and slimes. Unfortunately, after the update InDev 12, my graphics chip could no longer support the game. I'd try starting it up and it crashed time and time again.\nFast forward a few months, I get a different computer and a new nVidia graphics card. I realize that I can run the game, and am quick to download and play it. I come back to InDev 14, and wow was it a joy.\n\nI essentially rediscovered the game, and so much had changed and been added to the development, that I was playing a very fresh game. I think that the fun of watching the game grow has been the best part of Retro-Pixel Castles so far, because it is a good game, and it has a lot of potential that I'm seeing put to use.

In addition the only crash I ever saw while testing the game before it came out here on steam was one the dev had already identified and was working on. The main concept of the game is that you cannot win, it simply gets harder and harder to survive as time passes. building choices are limited right now, and none of the planned mobs are implemented as of yet, as such I don't recomend buying the game right now unless you wish to help with bug finding and testing.

It really sucks :( I know that its still in development, and I'm really excited for all of the stuff thats in the drawing board, but seriously this game becomes very frustrating at a certain point because there is nothing you can do about your villagers being brutally ♥♥♥♥♥ by the evil masses.\n\nSome suggestions:\n\nBuilding priority - some way to make sure that villagers will actually build the structures they set up. I've gotten very fed up with how they'll drop all the resources at the buliding, but then just forget about it even though its the only thing queued up to build. So a firebolt tower might be fully set with resources but won't actually be usable for a whole day or two because the villagers get distracted. Maybe make sure that as soon as the last one drops resources on the building, he starts to work on it.\n\nSpecific land motivation - instead of just motivating the land in a general circle, maybe motivate certain resources. Its annoying having to either destroy or wait for my villagers to eventually chop down all the trees around small patches of food that I want to expand. If you try to expand without doing this, the forested area will just overrun the food, making it useless.\n\nHealing aura towers - monsters are quite overpowered and they outnumber your villagers easily. It'd be nice to have a slight but steady flow of health to them in certain areas. So you could set up a couple towers near the points of regular conflict and it would give them a little flow of health. This, or just making the healing aura more powerful would work. After about day 8 you need to drop a minimum of two healing auras to even make a dent in the damage that monsters do to your villagers. Thus using up a lot of your influence.\n\nDifferentiating between friendlies and enemy health - maybe its just me, because i'm slightly colorblind, but I have a hard time telling the difference between the health bars when theres one of those massive heaps of blood and fire. It'd be cool if the health bars were drastically different in the color, or if a colorblind mode was added so you could have complementary colors, making them complete opposites.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. When you get that flow of essence to your cullis gate, essence collectors, and firebolt towers... it just feels and looks amazing because theres all this power cycling through the map. Its a great way to show how everything is being fueled and refueled. After a successful night without any casualties, you feel like you did your godly job well. But its hard to get that job done because the people you rule are morons. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend getting this game just so you can master your setup and understand whats most important. That way, once the devs to add in more complicated mechanics, you'll have all the basics completely down. Otherwise you'll just be thrown in later on with a LOT to learn.\n\n9001/10 stars.","September 4, 2015","true","251.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

It offers a very useful video tutorial for first time players or you can go straight in. It's a little hard to get going but that makes it more of a challenge, right?\n\nI am feeling puzzled however as the game was working fine until today when I tried to play it, it crashes on start up. I'm sure this is an issue that will be solved in future by the game developers and that's IF it is the game itself. I am not yet sure of the cause but if people do have the same issue it will be helpful to know :)\n\nMy overall thought- A brilliant game and the perfect boredom breaker, I highly recommend.","May 27","true","12.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","9"

And I see sooooooo much potential & room for so many extra things that I see & hope the Dev will add to it.  Ive already spent several hours in game & even though it is missing quite a few other features & game mechanics & other things you would want; what it does have so far is more then enough to feel satisfied with & want to keep progressing & expanding.\n\nI had no problems with this game at all until a few hours ago when my game keeps crashing every 10-15 minutes.  I dont know if its cuz my base is too big now or what...but for now Im going to definately give this game a thumbs up as even for early access its very well done & Im sure the Dev will fix the any bugs as the game progresses.\n\nOut of all the other games like this that are out there; early access or even a completly done game; this game is one of the few that are at the top of the list.

This is one of my favorites. On peaceful you can just relax and play.. On survival you'll want to murder your computer. I love that about this game. I love the godlike powers and the attachment you'll develop for your little pixle people. It is in development, but from what I've seen it has plenty of potential and is well worth the money spent. As long as development continues. BTW, if you can handle bugginess, I'd suggest the unstable mode.

Other than that, its fairly easy. For those that don't know how to play, theres a tutorial avaliable for you. (I never watched it...)  Also, for those who dislike the map list, you can always create your own. (I love most of them, I think you will too!) This game has options for nearly anyone, and the ones whom don't have one, you can always request the owner to do so and it might happen! If you're lagging, please son't blame it on the game. It's probabily your PC, software or hardware. Overall, I'd think that adding more content and finishing the other modes (Sandbox and Recycle) would be perfect.\n\n[EDIT] Hey, can you add a map creation tutorial video?

Is liek Mincraft but so many more features like a the game goes to nighttime after it is daytime for so long. and you have to get things like wood and stone unlike minecraft were you just punch things. this gaem is super realistic. it has features like blood and water but its not just blood. like it spreads its cool..\n\nCongratulations, you read what it would look like if a 12 year old wrote a review for this game. I will now enlighten you with my actual review. For the record, this is build 10-31-2014. Currently this game is very limited in the features. Before you ever start a game it lets you know that there is just the core game to play with a few things added. You have some maps to pick between, some of them are test maps which narrows down the "usuable" maps even further. When you start, you get 24 villagers and have to build your village center. To do this, you must collect wood and stone from nearby sources. Once the village center is completed you gain access to more buildings; however, this too is extremely limited. You can build storage for food, wood, and stone. There are three different sizes of houses you can build, two sizes of farms, torches for light and walls.  Walls currently serve no purpose other than to look cool and to really make that retro looking pixelated castle feel that you wanted when you bought this game.  The villagers will marry and have children which causes the need for more food and shelter. This may feel slow and boring but once you start getting around 90-100 villagers it becomes more demanding. I managed to get over 410 villagers but due to lag and food shortages, the best i could do was simply let people start dying. Despite the numerous deaths, the villagers, or vermin, were breeding out of control and continually increased in numbers until my game crashed-- it is early access after all. Currently the game simulated building a colony and watching them thrive or spew blood across the canvas as they starve to death due to your incompetence as a pathetic god figure.  Either way, this game is already fun in its current state and if what they already have announced as future plans are promises and not just ideas that are never implemented, this game will only ever get better and I anticipate its official launch.  All I ask is that saves are added so my vermin(oops, I mean, people) infested islands can be saved before the villagers feel the wrath of torment of not only being starved to death in the midst of a famine, but instead, the excruciating pain of being.... deleted.","November 1, 2014","true","11.5"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

The game looks great with a pixelated style and impressive particle effects. The music is a matter of taste. I personally like it, but I wouldn't buy the soundtrack extra. The game can be very intense and you will probably need to start over a lot, because the monsters like slimes, zombies and skeletons get stronger everyday and you need to become stronger and faster everytime.

He is always looking from new crashes to take care of (the stable release is pretty stable now. 5/15/16).  He is an indie dev making a good little game.  He is indeed the developer who listens to you.  Take a look at the discussion board and you will see he has responses on the majority of threads.\n\nAs far as game development goes, there have been significant and continual changes in the last year.  Every aspect of the game has matured.  More god powers.  Monster spawns are different.  Monsters will break down walls if they can't find a way in.  There are many more tower types than before.  there are now seasons.  There is a "full map", which lets you take stuff from one village to help with or start another if you survive long enough to prosper. ;)\n\nGame Review:\nVery fun little game.  The best way I can describe it is a God/tower defense village sim.  The game is similar to Banished in some aspects, but with the outside threat of the Undead.  It shares some aspects of Majesty as well.  It is a race against time to try and stay safe while the zombies and skeletons spawn (the monster spawning is going through some big changes in the current cycles so I left this a bit vague).\n\nYou don't have direct control of your guys which can lead to some hilarious situations; where someone runs from a zombie away from defense towers and deeper into trouble, or circles around a barricade to try and get that lump of stone that was dropped on the wrong side of the wall, etc.  A "grab" God power has been added so you can take care of some of these problems... if you are there to see it.\n\n\nIf you like Banished and tower defense games, or just want some good liero-style blood, this game is worth picking up, especially if it's on sale.  *Read what the dev has to say about the early access game before you purchase.*\n\n\nOh, and if you are looking for a god game this is so much better than Godus it's not even funny.\n\nedit: Updating review to current build - 1 year since purchase and I'm still enjoying the game.  At the games current price and my current hours.. I've paid 12 cents per hour of enjoyment. =)","March 15, 2015","true","80.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/M-I-H/recommended/328080/","M-I-H","MIH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/M-I-H/","59 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is very well made. Even though it´s still in development, it looks very promising.\n\nIt´s a combination of a management game and a godgame, where you have to build, maintain and protect your own village(s). And those two genres have been merged together very well in this game.\n\nI recently bought it as I saw it in the store and it caught my attention. It looked like a simple management game, indie style. I have played Banished before, and it looks a bit like it, but this game has it's own characteristics as well. You have an "influence bar", which acts as a mana bar. With this influence, you can cast godly spells to improve land, fireball land/enemies/enemy buildings and much more.\n\nThe game itself is very simple: You start with a global map with a couple of locations where you can start your first village. When you've chosen your location, you can start building! But you have to be fast. Just like other games, the night is very dangerous. The first night will remail calm, but the second night things go down... quickly.\n\nThe game has a season mechanic. You start in the spring, the easiest of all 4 seasons as food grows the quickest in this season. You have to stockpile food to make sure you can get through the summer, where food growth is significantly slower. The autumn is the second best season, where you can recover from the summer. Though not optimal, it's still good enough to re-establish your food stockpile, as the next season is the harshest: winter. Food growth is almost at a halt, so you better have some food stored. However, with your godly abilities you can grab food from over the map and drop it in the village, to make sure you'll get through winter... if you even get there.\n\nBecause when playing the regular game, survival mode, so-called "graveyards" and "slime spawns" spawn quite often, spawning many enemies. Eventually a lot of the map is covered with these graveyards and when the night comes, they can assault your village. If you haven't prepared your defences before that happens, it's pretty much over (RIP me :( ).\n\nBut if you want to take it easy, there is also a peaceful mode, where almost no enemies spawn. It's a good way to learn the mechanics, as it's way more forgiving if you are a bit slow. If you don't know how to play the game at first, at the main menu there's a button which redirects you to a youtube video, explaining some of the basic mechanics of the game. It's quite helpful. You'll get tips on how to make your defences as good as possible and how different defensive towers work.\n\nIt has some performence issues (at least for me) when autosaving, where your screen freezes for the duration. It isn't that bad, its usually for less than a second. There isn't however a way to decrease graphics so you have to play with a lot of particles all the time. And it's a lot, because there has been a lot of attention to details, which I absolutely love.\n\nThe soundtrack is cute and athmospheric. It makes this game even more cute than it already is. That, which the sometimes corky and sometimes sarcastic pop-ups when you lose a villager or at the splashart of the main menu, makes it a very cute product over all.\n\nI'd give this an 8/10. It's very cute, it shows potential. However, it is a bit repetitive as you cannot develop a lot with for example a tech-tree or something. It's more like when you can process your wood and stone, you can basically build everything, which makes it somewhat less exciting rather quick. Yet it's a good game to kill some time with. You'll fall in love with the cuteness!","May 27","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had to update my java...an eternal task that if there is an afterlife I surely will still have to do.\n-1 Mouse scrolling on maps(worldmap and micro) was inverted with no way to fix it. Think dragging an icon on your computer and the cursor goes the opposite way. There is an option to toggle "Invert Map Scrolling" but it did not seem to do anything. Perhaps it is a bug. Keyboard scrolling for the worldmap works fine though. I suspect if you are a filthy mac user you might not find it a problem (natural scrolling?). I am not sure though.\n-1 Learning the game is not painless. There are tooltips that are very useful but still lacking. For one, the game continues to run while you are reading and trying find the things the tooltip talks about. For this reason time (hunger, monsters, etc.) are disincentivising you from reading and understanding. The UI is also unexplained. I had trouble figuring out how to build a farm and defensive structures (icon on right of the screen by the way) until it was too late.\n-1 I found the font not easy to read. Fancyness work against a font if it is not easily readable.\n+1 neat concept of certain God-like abilities to replenish resources on the map, set the earth on fire, heal villagers, et cetera.

I think Gnomoria and Banished are two of my most played games on Steam with about 60 and 30 hours respectively. I put about 40 hours into Dwarf Fortress, and quite enjoyed it. While RPC desperately wants to be like these titles, it is very far off - in a bad way.\n\nFirst thing everybody should know is that there is no below-ground mining. Your world consists of a small-ish 'asteroid' that is one layer of ground thick, floating in space. There are frequent areas of the map that are just 'holes' where you can see the space behind the one-layer thick ground. I am certain that this strange mechanism is a result of limited money/resources/programming ability (idk), and was not intended. The allure of the games cited as inspiration (listed in first paragraph) was largely because you could take 'stuff' out of the ground and organize it above ground! When you take that away, I am significantly less interested.\n\nYou cannot rotate buildings because it would take too much effort to redraw the images. I get it - prioritize developement, but this is something very basic that needs to be mentioned. It further hints at where this game is going. I would imagine these images could be done in a long weekend, am I right? I am not trying to be harsh, but potential buyers need to be aware of these things.\n\nThese are the main two issues I have but there are a myriad of others such as map and individual person custimazation that I will not go into fully.There are also very few buildings at this point. Otherwise the music is quite good, and the artwork is pretty cool. This game probably was released on Early Access a bit too early. I got it for half price, and am fine with it because I want to try any and all citybuilders/population managers.\n\nTo my Steam friends: if you haven't played Gnomoria or Banished yet, go for those! If you are like me and have exhausted those, this *might* quench your thirst for a bit.\n\nI don't believe any of the issues I put forth will be resolved (I mean its one guy working on this), but if they are, I will alter my review.

The elements of survival make it hard to thrive my village as I usually overwork them and they die due to the lack of food or essentials. This shows that you can't be too greedy with the manpower you have.

I think Gnomoria and Banished are two of my most played games on Steam with about 60 and 30 hours respectively. I put about 40 hours into Dwarf Fortress, and quite enjoyed it. While RPC desperately wants to be like these titles, it is very far off - in a bad way.\n\nFirst thing everybody should know is that there is no below-ground mining. Your world consists of a small-ish 'asteroid' that is one layer of ground thick, floating in space. There are frequent areas of the map that are just 'holes' where you can see the space behind the one-layer thick ground. I am certain that this strange mechanism is a result of limited money/resources/programming ability (idk), and was not intended. The allure of the games cited as inspiration (listed in first paragraph) was largely because you could take 'stuff' out of the ground and organize it above ground! When you take that away, I am significantly less interested.\n\nYou cannot rotate buildings because it would take too much effort to redraw the images. I get it - prioritize developement, but this is something very basic that needs to be mentioned. It further hints at where this game is going. I would imagine these images could be done in a long weekend, am I right? I am not trying to be harsh, but potential buyers need to be aware of these things.\n\nThese are the main two issues I have but there are a myriad of others such as map and individual person custimazation that I will not go into fully.There are also very few buildings at this point. Otherwise the music is quite good, and the artwork is pretty cool. This game probably was released on Early Access a bit too early. I got it for half price, and am fine with it because I want to try any and all citybuilders/population managers.\n\nTo my Steam friends: if you haven't played Gnomoria or Banished yet, go for those! If you are like me and have exhausted those, this *might* quench your thirst for a bit.\n\nI don't believe any of the issues I put forth will be resolved (I mean its one guy working on this), but if they are, I will alter my review. Thanks for reading,\n\n-Ryan","May 13, 2015","false","2.3"," 24 of 48 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","24","48","3","14"

Unfortunately I must still leave the review as it is, while the patch has gone a ways towards balancing the game but has also taken a step back in many aspects it still needs more work.\n\nI know this is a EA game and I really hope things improve down the road, but at the current point I can not recommend this game as even a game.\n\nAI Is glitched, you still have to micromanage how much wood you set to harvest and how much stone you set to harvest as attempting to build multiple buildings leads to all the buildings tending to have all their stone or all their wood delivered, instead of balancing the delivery,the bigger issue is that if your building multiple buildings it will attempt to deliver the last piece of stone but get distracted by a zombie and drop the stone, after that the builder will then go and start working on the other building leaving the building uncompleted for a fair while, sometimes even until the other building is finished.\n\nDeath Trap is still there and even worse since the removal of essence generation from the towers and collectors, now you can't even build effective defences, to even get defences in place you have to build all 3 havesting camps, collect and build the upgraded resources and then finally can build defences, but those are useless without collectors, you build those and you have to continually stock them with crystals, all that takes time away from building the essentials like food and housing.  Towers can't even seem to fire over walls which is major source of annoyance... You either limit your towers ability to fire or you have no way of containing your viliagers who will wander out of town for no reason and just idle in "zombie land"\n\nIndev 13 Stable 4 must be substantially bugged, change notes state that spawns have been substantially reduced yet somehow I got a hoard of 14 !! zombies raiding my tower... on DAY 2! not even end of day but end of dawn.\n\nVillagers are smarter but still not there, as above they will walk away from the town or the farthest building into the middle of no where and just idle there... until they see a zombie and then they will rush to it, and then rush to the next and the next and the next... until they die.  Yes they will run away but that only lasts a couple steps and then they will see a zombie and run and attack, it's a game of ping pong now with the run, attack, run, attack action... the game really needs a way to contain the villagers, either walls with gates or a "no go" zone that you can mark villagers to not cross.\n\nDefence buildings are useless, zombies heal faster then the buildings can regenerate, spawn faster then the buildings can regenerate and it appears the more you build, the more zombies you bring.\n\nOnce you mark a building to be built you can't pause it (Being worked on but the button doesn't work still), you can't lower it in the queue and you can't cancel it, you can only dismantle it, instant if nothing was delivered to the building, but if the building had even 1 item delivered to it a builder has to go to the building to dismantle it...\n\nLooking forward to the next patch but the game is still too unbalanced to be enjoyable","January 24, 2015","false","4.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","3"

To be a village sim you might need a little more than that, honestly.\n\nYou are constantly attacked by monsters, day and night, without breaks. You can't tell your villagers to defend, you can only build towers (that are inadequate for the amount of monsters you receive), and hope for some villager to try and defend and not die. Because if they die, the only way to have another villager is to give free time (aka, stop building your village defenses) to your workers and wait a loooong time before a new one is born, while in the mean time you have less defenses and even more monsters.\n\nThe AI is very lackluster: building two or more buildings at a time really confuse builders, with the end result of having both of them unfinished for minutes. Gathering resource is dumb too, with villagers going for random sources instead of the nearest ones. Attacking enemies seems random too, with villagers attacking once, then starting to flee, then attacking again, then fleeing in the middle of other enemies, then dying.\n\nOn the art side of things: the graphics and UI are gorgeous. The sound track is quite good, although it isn't contextual: you can have an happy and reassuring track while the village is getting slaughtered. Particle effects are really cool and really add a lot to the presentation of the game.\n\nFor now I absolutely cannot recommend this game in the current state. I hope new content and new mechanics will be added to the game and the AI refined, so that this game will actually be about managing your village, not an endless cycle of building and rebuilding towers.","May 29","false","6.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

Perhaps too early.\n\nCheck back in 2016 when it's finished, it might be a decent game by then, until then, here's exactly why you shouldn't buy this game:\n\nNothing new to genre (Gnomoria is $8 and 20x the content).  No strategy involved, or rather not yet implemented.  No reward for playing, at all.  You die.  That's the game.  It's not that it's "hard," it's that it's not possible.\n\n\nLonger version for the developer:\nI agonized over writing a negative review.  I hate discouraging indie devs 'cause I love it when people explore new concepts and try to make it work and the passion people like you have for this is really a credit to the gaming community.\nIf you're set on making this particular game work, then more power to you, but there are some core fundamentals that need to change before this game is engaging or fun.  Guard zones and patrol routes would help tremendously.  Not pulling off all workers when an enemy is engaged would add some depth to the game.  Allowing workers to work on higher-tiered resources before all the lower-tiered demand has been met universally would help, either by assigning builders to a building (for every building, like with the initial town-hall) or setting up a priority queue system.  Birth rate needs to be at least tripled, because right now even surviving a long time still means a doomed world, and it seems the monster difficult scale will still allow for the "you won't survive" mentality you're aiming for, but would give non-survival a recourse and set a de-facto game objective of send as many people as possible to limbo so you can survive longer next game.  The other problem with making a game like this is it will eternally be difficult to balance and find the "fun spot" because a single game takes hours to play, and any change or feature that impacts day 1 will completely change all subsequent days.\nKeep in mind that I'm just a gamer and have no particular vested interest in this game in particular, I just am a sucker for this genre of game in general and love playing it, so do whatever you think is best and feel free to disregard my advice entirely.","October 31, 2015","false","12.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","2"

That being said, I'm still not feeling this. I was hoping this would have more management capabilities, instead  it feels like an ant farm simulator. the worst part about this is, and it doesn't seem to be changing any time soon, is the lack of a speed up feature. There are a limited amount of god powers that the developer added, but the building is still limited, and the features are fairly short for now.\n\nIt's not a terrible game, but it's still rather underdone for my taste.

I am an avid fan of dwarf fortress and so I figured I would enjoy this game!\n\n*sigh*  I really wish I did.\n\nFirst, I'll go with the pros vs the cons:\n\nPros:\n-The soundtrack is pretty.  I found myself humming one of the tunes earlier and it wasn't even a bother to me.  The music itself is calming and peaceful which is very much at odds with the game.\n-The concept of the game is appealing\n-The resource system has great potential\n-The aesthetic of the game is overall on point\n\ncons: (have a seat we're gonna be here awhile)\n-AI is totally ♥♥♥♥ed.  Where do I begin?  I'll start with that the villagers are total idiots.\n>I've had villagers with a single hitpoint rush monsters levels above them to get slaughtered easily.\n>I've had villagers retreat from monsters into crowds of other monsters despite there being safe avenues of escape.\n>I've had villagers fall asleep far outside the village where its "safe"(its totally not)\n>villagers drop their load to run and engage monsters instead of running away.\n> Villagers don't breed nearly fast enough, nor mate fast enough, and will idle even if a task is given to them.\n\n-monsters level faster than your villagers and endlessly spawn and enter the village.  This causes the entire game to feel very much like a grind.  Walls cost 6x the resources than they should which means long buildtimes and you'll get maybe 4 segments up before you're already getting rushed by an endless tide of enemies.  If you try and prioritize building a wall, you won't get other resource buildings up, and you can just forget about the bolt towers.  To get a single bolt tower running you need to build 5 other buildings.  The lumber shack, stone shack, crystallium shack, essence collector, and then FINALLY the bolt tower.  If you happen to get one of these up and running they're good against 2 of the 4 enemies. Slimes and zombies, who are generally the weaker two, and even then the essence yield from killing these is less than it took to kill them so you end up running at a loss with the additional penalty that your villagers don't rank up from combat which means that later they will be EVEN WEAKER than they already are in comparison to how quickly monsters level.\n\nAdd to that the suicidial banzai charge and you end up with watching 3 hours of gameplay suddenly get lost in about 15 minutes as what started with a single villager fighting a zombie ends up being 15 villagers dying as zombies, slimes, elementals and skeletons arrive at the hole in your wall faster than you can kill them.  In addition to losing an exceedingly large and hard(and really F****slow)-to-replace portion of your army, you then have a nice pool of resources 4 steps from the melee that your villagers dropped to rush into combat.  This causes the other villagers to go "oh hey, a resource over here" and they literally get to the resource to pick it up, walk a step, then drop it and run into the bloodbath.\n\nEven the guards are worthless as you cannot command them, so they wander around solo, engaging at will and engaging crowds of enemies they can't handle.  You can't arm them, and so really they don't seem to have a function different from a standard villager except that they might MIGHT have a little more armor, but they don't do other tasks.  You're basically making 'heroes', but that hamstrings you as, again, the enemy levels up faster and spawns infinitely.\n\nMonsters even attack during the day.  You get literally 0 downtime between enemies and it gets to be where you spend more time watching yourself lose the game than playing it.\n\nAdd to that that all combat spells are friendly-fire and you get a situation where you cannot actually defend your own walls if they're under attack without making the problem like, 10x worse.  Oh, did I mention that the repair system sucks too?  Villagers will repair 5 points of hp on a building before wandering off like the task is finished.  this means that it takes excessive amounts of time to get villagers to repair buildings that they are standing right next to.  I waited 10 minutes for 3 villagers to fix a F**** farm they were standing on top of because they kept trying to walk away to do other tasks, getting interrupted by monsters, and then would repair 15 points and do it all over again.\n\nadd to that that all spells are slow to recharge and also expensive.  Even the "low" cost spell will cost you 5 minutes out of game to get enough 'influence' to cast and it does like 5 damage and lights the enemy on fire... if your enemy is a zombie.  the fire will also go out in about 10 seconds, giving your regenerating enemy about 20 pts of damage.  (keep in mind a lvl 10zombie has like 600hp and you get an idea how worthless this is).  If you miss with the meteor you do very little damage, but of course if you hit you might splat your opponent outright.\n\nThe only spell with remote value is the healing spell, and your villagers will not stay in one place long enough for it to do anything outside of combat, and its so slow to heal that during combat it won't save your people.\n\nThis game has such potential but is honestly so borked and unbalanced that if you have any desire to build a village, watch it thrive, and have a lot of fun, go to bay12 games, download dwarf fortress for free, download a texture pack (to make it pretty: also free), and play that.\n\nThis game wasn't worth the 5 I paid for it on sale, and it most certainly isn't worth its full price at this present moment.  Honestly I could have gotten this game for free and felt I'd lost money.\n\nUltimately its worth the 5 at least ONLY because I know how much effort must have gone into this game, but its kinda like if you spent 5 dollars on a hamburger at a restaurant and it came out ♥♥♥♥♥ily and also on top of that you're vegan.  Sure its worth 5 dollars in the labour that went into making it, but its not something you'd ever want to eat, let alone pay for.","November 4, 2015","false","13.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

At the end of the day your main goal is to make a path with walls for the enemies to run down, and line that path with things that do damage to them. Sure there are some village sim concepts, and you can't save the game except when you exit. So I suppose that makes it rogue-like. What you really end up with is a glorified tower defense game. There is nothing wrong with that, but I wish that was part of the description. "If you could imagine a roguelike village sim, that's what this game is all about!" That doesn't mention tower defense. This reminds me a bit of the mistake I made by purchasing Secrets of Grindea. It acted like it was one type of game, but when the time came for it to deliver on a good boss and engaging gameplay, it used bullet-hell shooter mechanics as a clutch. It was a good dream, but short lived.","May 14, 2015","false","11.7"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","1"

The AI for one is frustrating, there is no way to set priorities so you're forced to place one build order at a time, and un-mark things from being harvested so your guys dont sit there harvesting wood forever ignoring the stone you need to finish building your defenses, it also has a weird love of wandering off and suiciding into large groups of zombies, and there doesnt seem to be any way to keep them from doing this unless they constantly have a build order, which unfortunately prevents you from raising your population as it's suicide to not have everyone building or harvesting at all times.\n\nMy second primary frustration in currently implemented features is the limited ammo on your only base defense, the fire towers, they run out of ammo so quickly even when backed up by an essence collector that they're borderline useless, even a large group of them has a hard time taking down a single zombie. While you can build a full wall around your base and use build orders to help make sure all your guys are trapped inside instead of outside it will crash the game as the zombie buildup hurts performance badly if you're not constantly killing them.","January 5, 2015","false","15.7"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","4"

Even the few objects seem to be "permutations" of each other an contain functions of other buildings. I personally did not like that it seems to be rather "fighting" based (zombies etc.) and  i would rather like to see economy of my village grow and spend more time on that... As i said, the idea looks nice but i would have it rather in the dwarf fortress direction (which is rather based in economy than fighting). I did not want to bash your game and will definitely come back to reevaluate it, but currently i would not recommend it, because everyting seems rather limited and not like its worth 10 bucks. No offense but currently i would say that there are free games that give you the same fun and depth and the game rather seems like something you would get for free on a pc-magazine (back in the old days when they gave you CDs with it). An example that would be comparable from the style is clonk which is roughly 10 years old ! Another (also free) example is the latter named dwarf fortress which seems like 10 time the depth of this game.\n\nI know that it is hard to develop a game and please dont get this review wrong ! But if you sell a product for money you have to stand up for it no matter if its early access. And my personal opinion is, that in early access the product should not develop much from the content, but early access is for getting the flaws and small bugs out of the game. Not to actually develop it. I know that most game developers do it like this, which does not make it right. This particular game has a lot of potential, but currently i would not spend money on this.\n\nIts easy to only beef about something without giving advice on how i would like to see it develop. An example: Crepper world evermore. The first two parts were completely free and the third part came to steam without any early access thing and for a decent price.\n\nI personally experience it as a ripoff if the content of the game is developed in the (paid) early access since that is not what it is about. The early access is for fine-tuning the game and get some feedback from the comunity. Its about giving the game its last 5-10% not its last 50%.\n\nSorry that all of my all of my bottled-up displeasure about seemingly half-ready games got into this review.

I had some fun making a map except the framerate went to 14 when I test played it. I wish that steam workshop was available so I could publish my map, but that can wait because the game is still VERY enjoyable without it. But the build priority list is really cluttered and I wish there were tabs seperating finished from unfinished buildings. Overall the gamemode Peacefull mostly lives up to it's name except the occaisionall horde of lvl 10 fire elementals that kill half your people and defenses. I give this game a 87/100 because I already mentioned the problems that the game has and there arent many.","November 24, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can put 10 hours into this game in its current state and that’s when the game insta gibs you.  What I mean is that the game gets harder each passing day and eventually your people will just get overwhelmed no matter how many babys and people you spawn in or however many fireballs you cast.  The dev has some great plans in the future that will address this issue and give more to the game.

I guess I would say that it's something of a god-sim mixed with a city-building sim. Nothing too outside the box, generally speaking.\n\nWhat else can I really say? My little men and women run about the world, mating and harvesting and mating some more (and stopping to chat all the damn time), and I continue to direct them to build stone walls, fire towers, and refining facilities. There's not much more to it at this point. However, that's due to the fact that the game is still in early access rather than any lack of vision on the part of the developers. I can see that there is a lot of room to grow in Retro-Pixel Castles and I have high hopes that the devs will continue to utilize that space.\n\nThe tutorials cover most everything you will need to know (not everything, of course, but they're tutorials - not strategy guides. I feel like there should be some information left to the player to discover). It's not difficult to figure out how to get a thriving community up and running once you understand the basic build order.\n\nI guess that would be one of my main complaints about the game (and there aren't too many complaints I could actually list - see the end of the review for my short list): once you understand the basic build order of the game there isn't very much in the way of challenge with attaining a thriving community. It seems like the game is, so far, simple and easy. This can be changed further on in development, and I feel like with the addition of more content the challenge rating should rise decently.\n\nSince pro/con lists seem to be all the rage in reviews, I will use one now. This list is not exhaustive.\n\nPros:\n+Easy to learn mechanics\n+Enjoyable and open-ended simulation\n+Pleasing graphical elements\n+Entertaining gameplay\n\nCons:\n-Soundtrack gets repetitive\n-It can be a bit of a hassle figuring out which unit is your villager and which is the monster in a large melee\n-Small amount of content at this point\n-Lack of effective late-game purpose (once I've built all the buildings and made my havens safe for my townsfolk there isn't any reason to continue except to raise a large population in order to populate more areas of the map)\n\nI want to make a note that I feel like all of the cons so listed are easily fixed and I have a good feeling that the devs are either currently working towards those goals or will soon begin to do so.\n\nI won't waste any time attempting to offer my thoughts as to how to fix said cons - this is simply a review.\n\nAnyway, without going on too long (too late) I would have to say this: if you're a fan of god sims or city building sims then you should definitely keep an eye on this game. With a few more updates I think it could easily become a mainstay of your gaming repertoire. With a full complement of content I feel that Retro-Pixel Castles could be something great.","March 25","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
