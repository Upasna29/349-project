Imitation is sometimes considered flattery afterall.  But, I will say, sometimes the dialogue just makes not much sense, while humorous at times, its sometimes a bit flat. Also, the story has some serious holes in it. Sometimes plot holes can be  excused, but these are of the severe type that if you catch them you'll be wondering, "Where did he come from?" or "How does he know all of this?" And its never explained later on  how one of the characters knows what he knows(which would have  been acceptable).\n\nBut if you want something quick, and easy and  it requires a little bit of brain power (some puzzles are okay, some are a bit...odd, for lack of a better word) then this game is for you. However, I don't think its worth ten dollars for its length. Perhaps $4.99.","December 8, 2013","true","3.9"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","21","28","0","0"

The humour, graphics style and music seem heavily inspired by Monkey Island and The Dig. The quality of these, in addition to the animations, are quite high.\n\nIt only took 5 hours to complete, which included getting stuck for an hour on a puzzle where you have to pick up an invisible item which is a part of the foreground scenery. That one part slightly tainted an otherwise well designed game.\n\nAnother potential deterrent for some is the lack of voice acting, exacerbated by the dialogue being difficult to read due to the choice of writing style and font, as well as some slightly imperfect English localisation.\n\nAll in all, it was easy to look past the small number of imperfections and enjoy a well made adventure.","April 28, 2014","true","7.5"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

No, it’s no Jolly Rover, but it’s no Maniac Mansion, either. But dammit if it doesn’t try. You can switch between characters, it has a somewhat similar look and feel to Curse of Monkey Island if it was fused with the later Space Quests…but it doesn’t entirely work.  The puzzles often don’t make much sense and as a result, you have a lot of obscure puzzles mixed with a bit of ho-hum dialogue. You could certainly do a lot worse (Jolly Rover), but it’s not entirely terrible.\n\nHonestly, for the price, I MIGHT recommend it…but only if you really, really like point and click adventure gaming.","March 16, 2014","false","3.7"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

For people who enjoy PnC games like the classic Lucas Arts games (Monkey Island series, Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max), you'll feel right at home with the controls and humor.  For those who aren't too familiar with PnC games, this is a decent introduction to the genre.  The game offers two different modes, casual and adventure, depending on if you want clues or not.  The clues offered in casual mode are mostly useless, unless you really don't pay any attention to what you have to do.  There are two pixel hunts throughout the entire game that threw off my rhythm (not too bad compared to other games).  Most of the puzzles are pretty intuitive.  The overall story and gags aren't as good as what you would expect from the Lucas Arts games, but it still was fun overall, and you can get through the game in under 3 hours if you are sharp on detail.\n\nBottom line, get it if you are a big fan of the Lucas Arts series, or if you are new to the PnC adventures.  It isn't one of the best games, but it is fun and humorous none the less.","September 13, 2014","true","4.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I feel like this game is a very good starting point if you are new to point and click adventure games. The reason for this is the game is not too difficult, but there are some pretty good puzzles that make you think (I believe the puzzles are what define this style the most, since other aspects are easily found in other styles of games). I think that there are some games out there that take the puzzles too far to the point of frustration for veteran point and click adventure gamers, as well as those new to these games. For someone like me, I can live with some of these less desirable parts because I have witnessed some truly astounding games of this style! But sadly for some newcomers, they leave before they can see the great aspects that these types of games have to offer. Therefore, I think this game is a good safe start if you are looking to try out these types of games.\n\nOn a more negative note, the game sadly was not a very long one, which in turn made the story very short and a little bit under developed. The story turned out to be decent enough, but remember I said decent, not "the greatest thing since sliced bread". I was also not super into the style of the art and design of the game, but while I wasn't into how the game looked I have to admit that I think many people would enjoy the art of the game and many would also consider the art to be quite good. One last thing that you will have to live with is reading text. No voice acting. Again, not something that someone who played any of the older Sierra and Lucasarts games would have a problem with, but others might.\n\nSo while this game does not fall in my top tier of point and click adventure games, I didn’t feel like it had any glaring problems either and I do believe that the game is worth a try for fans old and new. If you have some spare time pick up this game, sit back, relax, and enjoy your next voyage in space.\n\nCheck out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!","January 25","true","7.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Ended with a really rushed, nonsensical, and not to mention pretty offensive ending that just left a sick taste in my mouth (it includes a crossdressing joke and the main villain getting creeped at when they get put in prison. Yeah.)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiffanyAK/recommended/65080/","TiffanyAK","TiffanyAK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiffanyAK/","1800 products in account","This is one that I recommend only with some rather strong reservations, and on the condition that you get it on sale with a massive discount. For one, this is a game that I replayed twice in an effort to add to my in-game achievements total. I still can't really say why, escept that it was relaxing. But, in any case, that should tell you just how short it is. When you add in the fact that it also is a bit glitchy, causing a need to sometimes go into the auto-saves and load the most recent one, thus doing some amount of replaying, in order to successfully continue the game, the issue becomes even more glaring. The in-game hint system is flawed as well, so if you do get stuck, you can't really rely on it. Fortunately, most of the puzzles are quite simple to figure out, and there are only a couple parts that might truly trip a general gamer up a bit. I managed to get almost all of the in-game achievements with little trouble before getting too bored to keep on with it, but even the developers apparently no longer remember how the trickier ones are earned, or just aren't telling, so if you're playing for that reason at all, be warned that you're mostly on your own there. All of this said, despite the glitches, simplicity, and other issues, the game is actually pretty fun if you enjoy point-and-click gameplay. I really liked the light humor, the "alternate" ending, and the look and sound of the game as a whole. Yes, it does get boring fast after the first playthrough, and the glitches are irritating when they do trip you up, but if you get it in a bundle like I did, or from a really good sale, then it's definitely worth trying out. If they ever add on trading cards or Steam achievements, I'll say that even more enthusiastically, though most of the time I don't really view those things as important. If you play the game, you'll understand.","June 19, 2014","true","6.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You're mostly on different planets that are very much like Earth so it doesn't really feel like you're in space.\n\nThe game has 2 difficulty modes: adventure and casual. In casual mode you can get hints if you need them and in adventure mode you can't. That's pretty much the only difference between them. As for the controls, you have just 2 options to choose from: look at something and use/pick up something.\n\nThe game doesn't have voice acting so you have to read the subtitles to find out what's going on. I didn't find the story to be that great so I just skimmed through the conversations. The lack of voice acting is probably a good thing, because the quite likely bad voice acting would have made the game worse for me. The music was pretty good though.\n\nMost of the puzzles were pretty simple and easy to figure out. There were a few puzzles where you had to interact with objects that were somewhat hidden in the environment and it took me a while to find them. However, there is a button that shows all the objects on the screen that you can interact with, but I didn't use it. Once I found the "hidden" thing I needed to interact with, rest of the puzzle was very easy to figure out.\n\nOverall it's a pretty good game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/avantesma/recommended/65080/","avantesma","Avantesma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/avantesma/","1872 products in account","Kaptain Brawe: A Brawe New World is a point & click game in the style of old LucasArts classics.\nWhile the idea behind the game is good, the final product strikes me as somewhat unpolished.\n\nThe comical – sometimes satyrical – plot is interesting, but very short, making up for less than five hours of gameplay.\n\nPresentation is good, overall: while the absence of voicework may sound – or rather, not sound – strange to players of modern works in the genre, dialogues are well written and the artwork is beautiful.\n\nGameplay is mostly good. I have one significant complaint, however: game modes should be better explained in the selection screen. In my playthrough, I chose "Casual" mode, believing "Hardcore" was this game's version of Monkey Island 3's "Mega Monkey" mode: extended puzzles, providing replayability. And the ambiguos description allows such conclusion.\nHowever, it is basically a choice between interfaces: "Hardcore" features a multi-interaction cursor reminiscent of Full Throttle, while Casual" simplifies interactions by giving only one choice (as seen in several titles, like the Broken Sword series and The Book of Unwriten Tales).\nHad I understood it better, I'd definitely have chosen the former over the later.\n\nKaptain Brawe is, in hindsight, a diamond in the rough: decent, has great potential, but could benefit immensely from a remake and/or spawn a truly amazing sequel... Or sequels.\nToo bad two consecutive efforts by Cateia Games to crowd-fund Kaptain Brawe 2: A Space Travesty through Kickstarter failed, despite attachment of point & click veterans Steve Ince and Bill Tiller to the project.\nWe can only hope the developers don't give up, as there's surely much to be missed.","March 17, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game interface is very clean and intuitive, the puzzles involve gathering and using a lot of objects but are not overly complicated. There isn't such a thing as pixel hunting involved, but some objects can remain cleverly concealed in the environment until you take time to examine them.\n\nThe only thing to disappoint is that dialogues, no matter how funny, are not voiced over. There isn't an abundance of text to read but a point-and-click adventure game usually benefits greatly from a decent voice acting. I personally grew up playing text-only adventure games and don't find the lack of voices that much of a letdown.\n\nOverall, Kaptain Brawe is an unforgettably pleasant experience.","October 21, 2011","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a longtime fan of the genre, I typically love any game that follows the classic point and click RPG format of King's Quest, Kyrandia, Full throttle, etc. I love that these games are coming back, with a great resurgence in the Tell Tale games series, The Silent Age, and more. However- Kaptain Brawe just sucked. While the artwork is nice and certainly original, the puzzles have remarkably little logic. A lot of the game made no sense, and seemed to depend upon you having some innate knowledge that simply hadn't been imparted by the story. It's also way too short for what you pay. I appreciate that the designers may have been trying to pay homage to the classics, but Kaptain Brawe is simply not worth your money.","March 28","false","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved the cartoonish style and the  throwback to the golden era of gaming, but unfortunately that's where it stops short. The game is not very long (about 7-8 hours), but it's a decent experience overall. The problem is, it could have been much better if it had better story development, more fully-fleshed characters and more entertaining puzzles. I love point and click adventure games, but if I spend too much time combining things at random and when I get bored and look for the walkthrough I don't go "Damn, I should have thought about that!", but instead "WTF!", well, that takes away from the gaming experience. To be fair, there are some fun puzzles, that actually add to the story, but I wish there were more of them and more story development to begin with.\nI always wonder when I see a game like this, why it fell short of it's potential? For indie projects I assume it's all about the budget, but still...   I would recommend this game only for P&C fans and when it's on sale.","December 7, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wasn't really able to connect with the characters or the universe they live in, which I find rather important for a game like this.\n\nIt is far from the worst point-and-click game I have ever played.
