account","Ok i have held of writing a review on this game for quite a while now as i wanted to play it and watch as it developed further through its journey to full release.So now after playing through the first five world's (level's - but each one really does feel like a seperate world and each really does have its own identity) and tallying up nearly fiveteen hour's of play i think its about time i review this very interesting and at time's puzzling game.\nIs it any good???\nAnd do you really want to solve its mysteries and delve into its depth's???\nWell read on and find out if i recommend this game and if its worth jumping in just yet.\n\nSoul Axiom - Early Access Trailer -\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=y1W-6Wzz3nk\n\nOk so this game come's at us by the same indie studio that developed Master Reboot and at time's it really does show and that's not a bad thing at all,Master Reboot is a very good game and one that was well received with good reason.At first though this game seem's very similar and yet as you play through what's on offer you'll come to realise even with these similarities that Soul Axiom is so much more and it really has benefited from the guy's time spent making Master Reboot but (and its a very big BUT-but not as big as Beyonce's) this game really is better in all the right way's and in all the right place's so let's get on to explaining exactally why.\nOk so first up the most important thing this game has on offer its elusive and mysterious story,now when you start up the game you are free falling through the cloud's during a storm and whilst your falling lightning flashes all around you and you see snipits of memories...........your memories??????,then whilst trying to make some sense of what's going on you look down and see a very large object approaching fast and your directly on a collision course with it AARRGGHHHHHHHHHHHH I'M GOING TO DIE!!!!!!!!!!\nBut no you find yourself on the deck of a ship,the weather beating down on your face.As you look around you see people but you can barely make out their features,they seem to be searching for something on the horizon then you spot an old man at the helm.Next all hell breaks loose and.......................well let's leave it there shall we.\nSo that's how the game start's and to say much more would spoil your time spent discovering it for yourself as with this game the less you know before hand the better.\nLet's just say that your journey will lead you through more than a few tricky situations and you will find yourself travelling to places far and wide,and strange and exotic.\nThe graphic's are really well done and suit this game down to the ground and they are only getting better the further the game get's through its development cycle.The jungle level looked good before but now with the update they just released (which included a whole new level-and dare i say its the best level so far) it doesnt just look good it looks great.This also applies to all the other place's you will end up visiting as well and each area has had as much work and effort poured into it as the last one,you can really see that the game is a labour of love for the development team and it really does show.\n\nHeres a great shot from one of the places you will end up visiting......................why you end up here,well im not saying ?????????\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=391076424\n\nNow gameplay wise the game play's out like a puzzler but is in no way your standard run of the mill affair,as you progress through the story you will eventually come across new abilities that you use to change and manipulate the world around you and in true puzzle game fashion (PORTAL anyone??) you wont make any headway until you learn to use them properly.\nAt this moment during its development there are three possible abilities to aquire and each one has a very different effect on the world around you.One give's you the power to create ball's of flame which you use to blast away at item's and blocked of area's on screen that can lead to new undiscovered places for you to move onto and explore.\nYet another let's you move object's by the power (of what can only be described as) telekinesis which help's in creating safe route's over lava by moving objects ECT for you to walk on.Lastly (which is the first ability you get) you can make object's that are unstable break down or you can recreate object's that have broken down into particle's,thus moving obstacle's in your way or creating item's that can be used to climb on ECT.\nOk last but by no mean's least sound and spoken dialogue,the spoken dialogue in game is all delivered really well for what's there but it takes a back seat to the sound in game that's yet another highlight and the score that accompanies the game has been really well thought out and capture's what's going on in each world you will visit pefectly,from drum's in the jungle level to gunfire in the gulf war everywhere you go will have its own score and sound effect's,and that's what really help's them to all feel different and fresh and give's each one you visit its own unique identity.\n\nHere's a great track from the game,and one that really did stick in my mind (I'm still humming it now DAMMIT!!)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1B5Jjg76og\n\nSO IN A NUTSHELL THEN HOW DO I FEEL ABOUT MY SOUL SEARCHING TIME SPENT PLAYING THIS GAME ??????????\nSo during my play time with the game during its early access stint i have really enjoyed what is a dark and facinating journey through someone's soul (and by the look of thing's other people's as well).The game play's really well and the developer's are allways working hard and bringing out regular update's which improve not only the quality of the game (from graphic's and sorting out minor bugs) but the overall size of it as well,as with every major update come's a new and more interesting slice of the overall pie and trust me once it all come's together and its fully released this is going to be one very special experience indeed.\nOk so will you like and enjoy this well made and mysterious game,well as allways answer the following three question's and then you decide -\n\n1 - Are you ok buying into a game that even though it is in a really great and playable state (with very few bug's - except the ones in the jungle level) is still in early access and isnt finished just yet ??\n\n2 - Do you want to be taken on a dark yet very strange tale of soul's and mortality ??\n\n3 - Are puzzle games your bag as you will spend a lot of time in the game solving puzzle's using the new abilities you gain,so dont sign up if that's not for you (and some are a little tough) ??\n\nIf you answered yes to the above question's then what are you waiting for buy the game now and get playing this oft dark tale.If not that's ok as puzzle game's arent for everyone but trust me you will be missing out on one of the best early access games this reviewer has ever played (and thats a FACT)!!!!\n\n(I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CLIPS OF VIDEOS PUT UP IN THIS REVIEW AND THEY BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS

Those to mechanics are fun to use honestly, and hopefully there's more to play around with too.\n\nMy problem with it now is some of it's levels feel too empty, maybe add more effects or..a crack? i don't, just anything to make it feel not like a grey box level. Second problem is I hope that some of the objects in the world have a better outline for you to use your ability on while 'not looking at it' , which makes it more convenient and saving time. Lastly there's sometimes no way of telling if I'm done with a level or not, making me confused as to where should i go next.\n\nOverall I like the game and the direction it's heading in, just a few tweaks with the visuals and pointers to make the player experience through the game more smooth and less confusing, and in it's current state there isn't much bugs and the game runs like a charm for me, so get it if you want, if you like these types of puzzle adventure games.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post","November 17, 2014","true","2.0"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

Although I can't say how the game will look like on release, or how long will it take you to beat it, but one thing is certain: Wales Intercative did it again. They created a game, which is a worthy sequel of Master Reboot.\n\nAwakened on a ship...\n\nSoul Axiom, just like Master Reboot, lets you control an unknown person, who has no clues where he is, and doesn't know how did he get there. One thing he knows for sure: He has to go on, which means solving a lot of puzzles within memory fragments, while collecting powers. Powers are unique power-ups, and they'll be described later in the review.\n\nReliving your memories is not impossible anymore...\n\nThe game takes place in several locations and environments. One memory plays in a Military base, another in a Museum, and another on a beach. And this is the part, which is a huge + for SA. The level and puzzle designs are amazing. You can't find the same location or even the same puzzle twice in the game. Wales Interactive proved with Master Reboot, that their level and puzzle-making possibilities are endless, and they continuing to show it off in Soul Axiom too. Their puzzles are hard enough to make you think, but they aren't frustrating. If I'd have to compare the experience, I'd compare it to The Talos Principle. You are thinking on the solution, try to execute your idea, fail a few times, and then, when you achieve a breakthrough, your body fills with the best euphoria you could ever experience. I'm not a fan of Point&Click "level" puzzles, but I actually had a lot of fun figuring out the solution. Even though SA is in Early Access, it looks really polished. WI just updated to Unity 5, and it looks wonderful. Every environment has an atmosphere, thanks to the unique graphics. Now, let's talk a bit about powers. There are 3, Phase, Play and Destroy. The first lets you spawn or de-spawn certain props, the second lets you move certain objects, while the third lets you destroy some things. Each puzzle uses one or more of these powers, and the game is pretty balanced, so you'll have time to learn about each power.\n\nThe PEMOs will guide you throughout your journey...\n\nMinimalist storytelling is a hard thing to do. If you uncover too few details about the story, the game will become un-understandable. Fortunately this is not the case with Soul Axiom. Master Reboot was a success in terms of storytelling. If you collected enough blue ducks, you got to know the story. Fortunately the devs didn't dump this idea, so in SA, you have to find PEMOs to understand everything.\n\nCan you hear me, can you hear me now?\n\nIf I'd say that music is non-existant in Soul Axiom, I would lie. I'd say that you won't notice it often, since your brain is working on the next puzzle's solution. But when you have some time to listen to the music, you'll have an amazing experience. The music is calm and relaxing, while always suits the environment. Character, environment and other sounds are good too, but I gues sthey will be enhanced further before release.\n\nLove your Community, and they will love you...\n\nSoul Axiom would deserve a huge YES even if it wouldn't be this good, but there is one more thing the devs doing right. And this is communication. They know that Early Access isn't meant to be a thing to get quick money by selling a half-finished product for people. Their game Soul Axiom is the true meaning of Early Access. Get involved with the game. They are constantly releasing new levels, and all of them has little bugs. You found one? Cool, please report it in the Official Bug Report Thread, and it will be fixed in the upcoming patch. Do you have suggestions? Post them freely in the Feedback thread. The devs are constantly in touch with the players, and this (along with the pefect level and puzzle-designs) is what makes Soul Axiom one of the best Early Access titles ever.\n\nVerdict\n\nOne of the best Early Access games out there, and I'm sure that this WILL be finished. These devs won't drain your wallet, and then leave you with a half-finished prduct. Does it worth 20$/EUR? For me, definitely yes. The game offers a lot of puzzles even now, and will be further expanded in the future. If you loved Master Reboot, you'll love this game too.","August 23, 2015","true","48.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

I can, without spoiling anything, tell you that the ending does add up to something that is concludable, in other words to something that is worth finding out.\n\nThe gameplay is really cool, although it suffers from poor movement and collision detection. There are rarely other bugs, and if anything the worst you'll encounter is getting stuck at one point or another inside a spot or room. Luckily the game does have a good saving system, so progress is almost never lost, and if you do it's not a lot.\n\nIn short: It's completely worth your money and support.

As you progress through the game, you will discover new powers that you need to use to manipulate, and destroy parts of the environment.\n\nOnce you reach the HUB in Elysia, there are 12 memories for you to learn about and experience. Each memory is set in a unique world to explore, with it’s own set of puzzles to figure out. If you are paying attention to your surroundings, there are plenty of clues that will help you greatly in finding the solutions.\n\nThe story starts as a mystery, and you have no idea who you are or how you wound up in the digital afterlife of Elysia. The story was interesting once I figured it all out, but it takes quite a while to put some of the mysteries of the game to rest.\n\nPros:controls are fully customizable, and the game has full controller support\nthe in-game memories (levels) are unique in their environments and style\nambience and background music are enjoyable\nmultiple settings to adjust graphics and audio for a better experience\nthere is a good amount of content available, all loaded with tons of puzzles\nexplore to find hidden collectibles for additional backstory and character information\nhaving powers to manipulate and destroy certain objects adds a nice feature to the game\nCons:quality of the cinematics seem like they are much lower than the rest of the game\nsome of the sound effects get a little annoying when you hear them repeating several times (this is usually by using certain powers or interacting with certain objects)\nno windowed fullscreen mode\nthe game forces you to replay some parts of the first 12 memories after you complete them, in order to access the 12 new corrupted memories, and fill in the story gaps\nthe powers seem to have a cooldown when using the same one in quick succession or after changing powers (this can be a minor annoyance on some of the quicker puzzles)\nI spent over 15 hours playing the game to complete everything, and then about another half an hour to experience each of the endings that the game has to offer. The game has a TON of unique puzzles. However, due to the nature of a puzzle game, I cannot see replaying the game once you fully complete it.\n\nSoul Axiom is a game that is meant for people who love puzzles, and if you do, you will probably enjoy it. I got a lot of enjoyment out of the gameplay, and I feel that I got my money’s worth in content. If you are not a big fan of puzzles, and problem solving, then you will probably not enjoy this game.","March 20","true","21.7"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","23","31","0","5"

It feels very much in the spirit of its predecessor, Master Reboot. However, the actual gameplay has made me livid and may prevent me from playing.\n\nThe powers you obtain only work in very context-specific situations, indicated by a tint in the coloring as well as colored outlines. However, these features are near impossible to see unless you stare directly at the object you must interact with, and even then they will occasionally blend in with the background.\n\nOther puzzles require outside knowledge. One puzzle required you know the flags of certain random countries, however you could still solve it with tedious trial-and-error. The last puzzle I tried required I match star constelations with their zodiac signs, at which point I stopped and said "I don't want to look all of this up".\n\nIf you do play it for the story and the overall esthetic, prepare for painfully tedious and annoying gameplay.","August 26, 2015","false","7.8"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","21","29","2","1"

This game caught my eye when I saw it on Steam the first time master Reboot was out. The trailer showed an interesting set-up, people being able to upload their memories to a digital database called the Soul Cloud where they could be relived and eventually lived in when that person dies. Then I saw something, a scary presence shown in the trailer. It was enough for me to buy the game, and I must say, great time playing it.\n\nWhile the controls are a bit finicky at times, I easily overlooked them for an interesting story and a unique game.\n\n-Overall an 8/10\n\nMy Novice Gameplay\nhttps://youtu.be/i7FhnKxMSq0","February 29","true","26.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","14","17","3","1"

The puzzles set the game apart from other FPP games by the way you must complete each level. You start out with a basic ability of being able to deconstruct certain objects and eventually gain other abilities making each level more and more complicated. Each level creates a different atmosphere and makes you almost feel like you started playing a different game. The puzzles aren't to complicated to figure out but there are some puzzling moments. Looking around the environment and exploring will reward clues in solving these puzzles. There are also lots of secrets to be found so if you want that 100% achievement, there will be some exploring to do. The game is in Early Access so you may encounter a bug or two but the development team seems to be working hard to squish any and all of them. I Highly recommend this game to any puzzle junkies out there or fans of games like portal, talos principle, TRI, or Qbeh-1.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVT4tHSi8rg","May 23, 2015","true","7.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Only the first "level" is open, at the time writing this review.\nI've really enjoyed the atmosphere so far.  It's very reminisent of Master Reboot but with a bit of an upgrade.  There are some areas that are too dark and others too bright.  But this is still early development, and I understand that.  The controls are extremely sensitive for me.  Sometimes i found it very difficult to move around without the worry of jumping right the hell off.  :D\nThe two different types of powers you get are really neat.  I'm excited to see how far they really take it as it has GREAT potential.  I wish for better hitboxes on identifying these items though as I found it to be quite difficult to hit certain objects some times or to even find them. Maybe make the GLOW a bit brighter and more obvious?\n\nThe biggest gripe i have with the game so far is you have to QUIT the game in order to go to your settings.  This made it really difficult to adjust my controller sensitivity.\n\nIf you're interested in watching a Lets Play, I started mine here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzWVFY2NBd8\nGood for tips/tricks if you're lost and can't figure something out.","November 18, 2014","true","2.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Master Reboot became one of my favorite games mainly because it was a good example of a successfull execution of a creative idea presented as a video\ngame with artistic value. Soul Axiom borrows everything that is worthy in Master Reboot and makes them better.\n\nThe story is loosely tied to Master Reboot and any issue of interest required from that plot is integrated into Soul Axiom's storyline. While the main story is told piece by piece in cutscenes at the end of every memory (memory=level), the theme and the plot is largely explained through collectibles, in the form of toy monkeys called PEMOs, like ducks in\nMaster Reboot. Pretty much like every other video game which contains collectible items, you sometimes forget about whatever it is you're doing and start to look for them so that you don't miss any critical part of the story. Unfortunately that has become an unwritten rule nobody seems to guestion (an axiom?) in modern video game design and since I can't\nreally think of a better alternative, I'm not complaining, and to be honest the "hunting" process in Soul Axiom is a lot less tiresome than it is in similar games.\n\nNew with Soul Axiom, now the protagonist has several powers which increases the amount of interaction and variety of puzzles. Together with the length (more than twice Master Reboot) and diversity of the story and the abandoned horror elements, this new feature makes Soul Axiom an all-around adventure experience.\n\nBeacuse the game takes place in some kind of virtual reality, the emphasis on graphical design is artistic rather than realistic. Soul Axiom has overall nice graphics, but from a subjective point of view, the game looks great. Especially the DoF effect really enhances the unreal and abstract atmosphere. The cutscene videos are a new addition to the series\nand although, being an older adventure gamer, I enjoyed watching them, I must say the level of quality was lower than the rest of the game. There are also a few non-game-breaking technical issues (like dysfunctioning AA options) right now which will probably be resolved in the near future.\n\nThere are many other games promising to provide unique psychological/philosophical experiences and almost all of them fall short. Soul Axiom is a great game that does everything it's supposed to do without going too deep (something I wouldn't mind if it did) and manages to keep you interested throughout the 20 hours you spend on this work of art. If you like adventure games in general you absolutely have to play this game. Starting with Master Reboot is recommended.","March 4","true","21.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

The start of the game is simply amazing and it really made me wonna play the game even more. You start the game by free falling through a storm, there are a lot of vivid flashes of your memories… you land on the deck of a ship and when you think you are safe….something really weird happens a shadow wing monster destroy the ship and then……the adventure begins (and the fun hehe ). The game is really awesome and there are a lot of aspects I loved in it! I should start by mentioning first the fact that you start the game by uploading your soul to Elysia.

Another fact that I found really amazing in this game are the abilities there are in this game. During your adventures and exploration in the world of Elysia and the Soul Axiom game…you will have the chance to acquire some pretty unique abilities that will aid you during your journey and they will make your gameplay experience even better and more interesting!\n\nYou will have the opportunity to use your abilities to manipulate the environment and adapt it to your will and also you will have the chance to revisit your old memories and unlock secret/hidden areas that you couldn’t access before. This is something that I loved a lot in the game. Another aspect of the game that I shouldn’t forget mentioning because it really was amazing, is the soundtrack of the game. Awesome music and background sounds will make the gameplay experience really unique and sometimes during the game I felt like I was in a dream…like I was exploring old memories and my own soul! What an awesome atmosphere to play a game!\nSoul Axiom screenshots Soul Axiom screenshots\n\nLast but not least, I would like to mention that the game is so worth getting and I totally recommend it to everyone! The atmosphere, the graphics, the music are simply addictive, amazing and so beautify and full of details , imagine that this title has even more staff to offer with regular updates and new levels I can’t find any reason why someone shouldn’t get it!\n\nVerdict:\n9/10","November 28, 2014","true","9.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Previously known for titles such as: Gravity Badgers, Master Reboot, Infinity Runner as well as a number of mobile games and apps.\n\nBeing in the early access stage there isn't exactly a story per se, however there is an element of one and I feel that was the developers intention. The game begins with you aboard an airship, adrift in the air, you’re tasked with attempting to restart the engines in order to reach whatever your destination was. As you do so you are attacked by some kind of demonic winged creature, causing your ship to crash.\n\n\nYou wake up in a desert seemingly dead, the only thing you can see is some kind of gas station entitled 'last chance' (saloon?) from there it’s up to you as the player to figure out what it is you're exactly supposed to do, which normally would be extremely bad, however as I mentioned I got the real feeling that this was entirely the point.\n\nThe game itself is a first person, sci-fi adventure puzzle game. The game consists of various different environments which contain several puzzles, you’re given various different “tools” at certain times in order to complete these puzzles. It’s up to you to figure out if and how the tools you currently have can be used in order to solve said puzzles.\n\n\nThe puzzles generally are not overly difficult but that really depends on your puzzle solving, there are some instances whereby you can try another environment/puzzle and come back to the one you have difficulty with later on. Generally speaking, a little bit of exploration will sometimes allow you to see how the puzzle works, or you may be lucky enough to find a devilishly hidden (if cryptic) hint.\n\nMechanically the game is extremely solid and whilst normally I would really slate a game for not having an objective marker, I genuinely feel as if something that obvious would actually detract from the game immersion, as well as one of the core elements of the game where it’s all part of the adventure. I would like to see however some kind of hint system to help those of us (like myself) who may get lost along the way. Which normally I would hate, but in this case really actually enjoyed.\n\n\nThe graphics, are quite frankly phenomenal,  Wales Interactive have stuck their trademark, quite unique art style which really feels expansive and immersive, each of the environments have a very Tron like aesthetic to a more or less degree. The soundtrack, whilst generally rather mellow and relaxing, changes to suit the environments and reacts well to the dramatic moments.\n\nOverall the game doesn't have much in the way of a story as such which is fine as it suits the style of the game, there is plenty of room for that to be added in. At this stage it’s too early to say what Wales Interactive will do with the “story” it certainly doesn't need much, only a little bit of background information. I found little to nothing wrong with this game aside from the aforementioned hint/objective reminder system for those like myself who either forget or just get completely lost in the world (semi on purpose) easily. The addition of a toggle/hold run option is highly recommended, in the hopes that the developer reads this. I'm really looking forward to the eventual completion of the game..\n\n8.5 / 10","June 9, 2015","true","4.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It will unfold as you play through it giving you ample time to understand where the story comes from. It does not give you easy answers at all.

Its a very interesting and enjoyable game with good puzzles and a very interesting story. If I should sum my experience, I would say; Tron Legacy meets QuestWorld (The VR world of The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest). The soundtrack is beautiful, the design is well executed, and the atmosphere is simply great. It took about 15 hours to finish the game, so its very long. And the story is really twisted. I definitely liked how the second part of the memory fragments twisted the story of every single memory fragments. There were only two so-so elements. The first is the quality of the cutscenes. But by time I got used to them. They served their purpose well and told the story what they needed to. And my second problem was reaching the corrupted cubes on every level, as to do that, you basically have to go half way through on every single level again. But beyond this, Soul Axiom is a great and highly recommended game.\n\nIf you haven't seen the Early Access' trailer, check it out.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geNuu-DyXK0","January 14","true","16.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The graphical style of which is quite simplistic at heart, but is quite a unique one and very tron-esque in places, taking clear inspiration from the iconic digital world as you explore memories of yourself in a world much like it. While the graphical fidelity itself certainly isn’t what I would call high, it does have a certain charm to it that I personally quite liked.\n\nThe world is vibrant and highly unique, and although similar in concept to their previous title Master Reboot, the execution of the presentation is far superior. The idea of exploring memories itself is quite intriguing and allows for some interesting possibilities. The story that fits alongside the strange world is rather odd, because it’s hard to really say where it’s going in its current stages, due to the lack of explanation thus far. However, the short interactions with the strange being that has popped up a few times have certainly caught my attention and it’s something I would love to see more of.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, it consists of environmental exploration and puzzle solving - this of which is done through the usage of certain abilities you pick up along your way. Currently there is only two however, that being removing and placing objects, and a rewind, pause and play function. How you use these with puzzles is actually quite intriguing, as you are able to cause specific objects to construct themselves or deconstruct before your very eyes, or you can rewind a moving object, pause or play it. The puzzles of which are entirely environmental thus far, meaning the manipulation of objects. I certainly found both of these to be very interesting mechanics, especially when bundled together and I look forward to seeing where they take it... However, there is one major problem with Soul Axiom - it's less than 40 minutes long.\n\nI should elaborate on this, because what is currently there in Soul Axiom is very polished and highly enjoyable, there just simply isn’t very much of it. It simply feels like paying for a pie and being given a single mouthful. Sure, it might be delicious and cooked to perfection, but that’s not what you paid for. Awful metaphors aside, an update post linked on the store page does detail the amount of content that is in the game currently, but the information is nowhere to be found on the store page itself.\n\nIn its current state I am personally disappointed with the amount that is currently there for the price that it is. The developers have however promised regular updates and I have full confidence that Soul Axiom will be a unique and highly enjoyable game upon completion, and that is personally what I would recommend waiting for. The fault partially lies within the genre, because can’t have a game of that type, so focused on narrative and exploration, part completed and leading to dead ends. For now, we will have to wait and see where Soul Axiom goes, because while the future looks like a bright one, right now it simply falls flat on its face.\n\nMore information can be found in the video preview below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaI4naJeIM4","November 23, 2014","false","1.2"," 27 of 51 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","27","51","0","1"

This game is a casual puzzler with an edgy, surreal, and ultimately unique vibe. The puzzles vary in difficulty from the laughably easy to the utterly cryptic; sometimes dependant on items, sometimes on timing, and often on cause and effect chain. It may frustrate at points, but it wouldn't be fun it were all easy.\n\nIf you liked Master Reboot, you will love this. Soul Axoim explands the in-game themes, varies the puzzles, and overall feels less linear than its predecessor while brining a bit more polish to the visuals.

A mix of exploration, action, adventure and puzzle solving set in a neon bright Tron coloured universe with a twist of horror thrown in, all viewed in FPS view, similar to Wales Interactive's previous game Master Reboot.\n\nThe elements mesh together really well and is a large step forward from the previous game, which played well and I enjoyed due to being a fan of sci-fi / horror, but at times felt more geared towards physical interation puzzles, compared to this very promising for early access and well crafted piece where every environment has been fun to explore and where the phsyiscal and metal puzzles work with the story to be great sum of parts.\n\nWould I get this game? If you like to explore fantasy / sci fi environments with a good story and a mix of different puzzles that are challenging but fair then this is the game for you. It plays as great single player game, but I would also say that if you have a spouse / partner / friend, you may want to try two player gaming as the mix of puzzles and environments makes it more interesting than gaming experiences. Streaming could aslo work well, from a watcher of many youtube let's plays.\n\nAll in all highly recommended as a purchase","August 20, 2015","true","22.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The game features wonderfully designed visuals and inventive puzzles.\n\nThere isn't much of a written narrative, rather the story unfolds through a series of events. You'll be going from level to level once you gain access to the game's main hub, and each level is almost like it's own puzzle. You have multiple powers to help you through your journey, and they vary in abilities. One allows you to disintegrate and reform objects, and another allows you to move and freeze objects in place, while more abilities will be coming in later versions. With these simple powers the developers have created some very inventive puzzles from what I've seen, often requiring creative thinking and a combination of all your powers to solve.\n\nThe game is a looker too. It's stylized very well, features great lighting and a color pallet that is easy on the eyes. The sound design is of equal quality as well. As far as Aesthetics is concerned, I have no complaints, it's simply a great looking and sounding game.\n\nSoul Axiom is currently in Early access. I find this type of game kind of awkward as an early access. There is a lot to like about Soul Axiom already, but since this game has a start to finish, narratively speaking, it is noticeably incomplete. As you start immersing yourself into the wonderful atmosphere the developers have created, you'll reach a point where the game just stops, telling you to wait for the next update. An abrupt and immersion breaking reminder that, this is a game... an incomplete game.\n\nOverall Soul Axiom shows a lot of promise with great visual design and intriguing puzzles, but because of it's incomplete state, I would suggest waiting for this game to be out of early access before making the purchase. Playing so far and having the game abruptly end until the next update almost feel like a spoiler to what otherwise, a very enjoyable experience.\n\nPros:\n- Great visual design\n- Excellent atmosphere\n- Inventive Puzzle design\n\nCons:\n- Feels noticeably incomplete currently\n- Puzzle difficulty vary wildly","March 9, 2015","true","4.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

At first I thought it was a glitch with the game but then I saw some figures standing on the ship looking at me and they glitched away with some pretty creepy noises. Similair creepy noises returned when finding the collectables in the form of an eye tearing through the surface of the ship...  this really freaked me out and I can't wait to find more of these to reveal the story!\n\nThe powers you collect are a really nice touch to the game, this one power lets you 'Phase' things in and out, meaning you can walk through objects or make objects appear out of knowhere. I saw in the trailer there is an orange power that shoots some sort of orb at things and even game doesn't involve much action/shooting, I could see this power making some of the puzzles very interesting. Did I forget to mention that you use these powers to solve puzzles which in-turn reveals bits of your story?\n\nI'm really loving this so far so please keep up the good work guys and I'm looking forward to more content being added.
