"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DRILLERDUD/recommended/19810/","DRILLERDUD","Yao Mung","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DRILLERDUD/","396 products in account","You can watch the video version of this written review at http://youtu.be/0IVcrAnJCbM\n\nI would like to preface this review by saying that I LOVE the original Ghost Recon. I have beaten that game at least eight or nine times. So imagine my surprise when I first load up The Sum Of All Fears and find out that it looks exactly like Ghost Recon! It was developed in 2002, one year after Ghost Recon, by Red Storm Entertainment, so it really shouldn't be a surprise that the engine and essentially everything else is pretty much the exact same. This would most likely be a negative point on most reviews, but considering my love for Ghost Recon, this was very welcome!\n\nHowever, there are a few changes, and they make this feel more like an expansion pack, rather than a standalone release. The Sum Of All Fears is quite literally a dumbed-down, streamlined version of Ghost Recon. Plain and simple. You don't get to assemble your own squad, the waypoints are pre-plotted for you, the skill-point system is gone, completing special objectives nets you no reward other than personal accomplishment, I could go on. This time, the game is focused on the story, which is actually based on a book, so I don't see why all these features had to be cut out. It's not like they had to spend their time coming up with a plot to this game. Maybe they didn't follow the book, I don't know.\n\nThe story follows you, a randomly generated HRT member, as you tear through West Virginia, killing tons of rednecks in news stations and underground complexes. Then, after the second mission, some ♥♥♥♥ decided to detonate a nuclear device in a football stadium in the middle of a game. That stadium is in Baltimore, Maryland, and a quick Google search shows that the Baltimore Ravens were completely wiped out by this bomb, along with whatever team they were playing (hopefully the Bengals), as well as hundreds of thousands of fans. If you ever want to get America's attention, you screw with its professional sports. 9/11 has NOTHING on this attack. Those towers were home to about as many national sports teams as Nebraska. Maybe this will take the focus off of 9/11 and this will be the attack everyone refuses to stop milking for the next three decades. That's enough to get the entire country ♥♥♥♥♥♥ enough to form a special task force in order to hunt down these monsters.\n\nFootball is great and all, but what makes me mad about all of this is that the nuke was detonated late December, 2001. The Wire, a prolific television show set in Baltimore, first premiered June 2, 2002. These terrorists effectively destroyed any chance of that show ever being made. Mother. ♥♥♥♥ers. Okay, you don't have to tell me twice, let's go kill everyone even remotely related to the plot.\n\nWhat did stay in this game is the stiff, tactical shooter gameplay that made Ghost Recon so much fun. One well-placed bullet can take a bad guy down, but that goes both ways. The AI can be a little dumb at times but Jesus Christ, once they get you in their line of sight, it's a mad trigger dash that usually ends in you eating a bullet. I know the game is tactical, and it's trying to be as realistic as it can, but when you get shot and don't die, your character takes about three minutes to forget about everything around him and fliiiinnnch.\n\nI appreciate that the developers actually made your character acknowledge when he's hit in a way other than annoyingly jerking your camera around, but it's really just a death sentence. You have no control when your character decides to do this, so by the time you are playable again, the enemy has probably shot you ten more times, and you are now dead. Good job. Thank god you can switch teammates.\n\nThe game doesn't really look too exciting, but something about the slow, trial-and-error gameplay just twists my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Filling a bad guy full of lead and then watching dust fly out of him like he's been sitting on a shelf for 3 years prior to this mission is really satisfying to me, and the game has a few extra options that add a little replay value onto it. If you gave me a choice, I would definitely choose Ghost Recon over this, but I'm happy that The Sum Of All Fears exists. There's 12 missions for you to complete, as opposed to Ghost Recon's 15, and in the end, spoiler alert, you do get the guy. But, the damage is already done; that universe still won't have The Wire. Shiiieeeeeeeeeet.\n","December 30, 2013","true","4.9"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","18","22","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepperbelly/recommended/19810/","pepperbelly","PepperBelly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepperbelly/","285 products in account","[Edit]: So I completed the game in just under 3 hours. Review points still stand.\n\nI've only put a little over and hour into it, but I'll summarize what I've experienced thus far:\n\nIt's a cross of Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear and Ghost Recon 1. It's developed on Ghost Recons engine, so the main menu to the actual in-game graphics and interface are near identical. You can't customize your loadout, although there are a lot of varied presets to choose from.\n\nYou manage one team which consists of three operators including yourself (other teams non-playable). Commands are basic and to the point, hitting a sweet spot, although you'll more often then not, rarely use it, unless of course you have a weapon not ideal for CQB, which is directly tied to the team loadout presets you can choose from.\n\nThe part that makes it similar to Rogue Spear and Raven Shield is the way missions are structured and play out. Every mission is pre-planned, and you have to follow the waypoint system that's in place. There's a mini-map that shows your surroundings and building layout. Enemies will pop up as red dots once you make visual contact with one.\n\nThere's also an auto-aim system directly in line with Rainbow Six 1/Rogue Spear where your crosshair will snap and lock onto enemy targets torso or head respectively. This can be toggled off if you prefer to aim manually within the gameplay options.\n\nThe story is somewhat interesting being it's based on the movie/novel. Instead of all the story elements being exclusively in the pre-mission briefings (similar to Ghost Recon 1), there's additional intel which comes in the form of press clippings or general news covering the ongoing situations from a civilian perspective, which can be amusing since you know what really went down.\n\nAll in all, for the price it's available at now ($4.99), I'd say it's worth it. If you liked Ghost Recon 1 and Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear, you'll most likely enjoy this as well, although it is more simplified and restricted compared to both games, it's still a good experience.","March 27","true","3.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

This title offers a short campaign where you play as a special FBI task force comprised of yourself and 2 A.I. officers in CQB environments. TSoAF uses pre-made mission plans along with go-codes for supporting teams controlled by artificial intelligence, which you can disable for a more challenging experience. Mission objectives bounce between the typical Tom Clancy fashion, such as hostage rescue and search and retrieve. If you're craving for some old school Red Storm action, check this one out.","May 5, 2014","true","7.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

This game isn't quite on the same level as the aforementioned games, but it's definitely up there. In SoAF you can plan your strategy for each level, and execute it in whatever fashion you like. The game feels a little linear at times, but it's also 12 years old now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/splashfriday/recommended/19810/","splashfriday","Splash Friday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/splashfriday/","265 products in account","OVERVIEW: Rainbow Recon - Lite\n\n+ CQC sized maps\n+ Ghost Recon ('01) engine\n+ One shot kills (unless your hitting appendages, vests)\n+ Mission Editor (located in the game's folder)\n+ Mod friendly\n\n+- No Planning\n+- Limited gear selection\n\n- Partially derped TeamAI\n- Occasional model glitches (ex: hand through weapon)\n- Less popular = less available mods\n\nVERDICT: A great way to introduce others to the world of tactical shooters from yesteryear before throwing them into the more hardcore establishments. Also great for getting your fix when short on time.\n\n\nREVIEW:\n\nThis game is what could be considered a streamlined, slightly more user-friendly approach to the classic tactical shooters. It's not as in-depth as the Rainbow Six or Ghost Recon games of the past but has just enough to make it enjoyable.\n\nBecause of this, when you don't have the time to go all-in with the other games you can still get your fix when you're waiting to leave for that VA appointment, or some such. And THAT is exactly why people should get this game. It's not Rainbow Six, nor is it Ghost Recon. But it takes a bit from both and it's still a hell of a lot better than most games being made today that toss around the words tactical shooter like a grain of salt. Besides, you could take the assets from this game and port them over to Ghost Recon for more variety.\n\nBased on the events of the movie with the same name, in singleplayer you play as an operator within the FBI under units like HRT and Spec Ops throughout the eleven mission campaign. Mission types consists of a number of objectives like clearing multiple floors, rescuing hostages, disabling alarms and the like. Although I prefer the hardest difficulty level, there are two others that players can choose from. I don't use them so I can't go into too much detail but they most likely involve less opposition and what not.\n\nEven though there is a single plan, by default, that's based on speed and objective completion, don't expect to be drawing up your own. There's no pre-mission planning involved. Of course, you can always stray from the path anyways. Still, if you were to use the provided mission editor in the game's folder, you could modify it all you want along with everything else by creating your own mod. However, given the date of when this game was released, creating total conversions could pose a challenge.\n\nYour gear selection is based on pre-selected weapon loadouts (HRT Stealth, Spec Ops Recon, Open Assault, etc) that contain variations of kits based on how you want to approach the mission. However, some don't appear until later missions due to their not being entirely necessary until then. Personally, there wasn't a single time that I needed a weapon that wasn't already included in the game to accomplish the missions.\n\nTeam members' actions can slightly be controlled by basic commands like choosing whether they should hold fire, stay put, or telling them to open a door. Very basic but for the most part they serve more as a mobile spawn point should you go down. Support units have their own plan and clear out other areas of the map.\n\nMultiplayer and Coop is there although I haven't attempted these yet. I'll update this review then. But the possibility of running the campaign with friends is present. As for replayability, you can try different difficulty modes, mods, create your own missions, play FireFight which has you clearing levels of enemies, or you can LoneWolf various missions.\n\nUltimately, this could be viewed as an expansion of sorts but released as it's own game. Nevertheless, one shouldn't over look it because they're comparing it to the classics. Instead, compare it to Call of Duty and then you'll see what I mean.","January 31, 2015","true","19.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The game is really good, but however the AI (your team) lacks focus and they usually end up getting themselves killed when you order them in the room against few people which kinda disappointed me. Nevertheless, it forces you to be smart on combat whenever things are looking down and not as you expected. You die very quickly if you leave yourself in the open (and can get stunned if shot).\n\nThe crosshair is extremely horrible in the game if you run or turn around, which means you have to be steady by either walking or crouching to increase aim and not move the mouse too hard. Campaign levels are rather short and i dont believe theres any multiplayer servers (?). But however it makes up with a quick mission where theres different modes if you wish to challenge yourself.\n\nI had fun, so give it a try whenever you can.","April 30, 2015","true","11.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It's the last game in the era of "classic" tactical shooters, like SWAT 3, Rogue Spear, Ghost Recon, etc, where you had to play it extremely slow, you actually completed objectives, and the game revolved more around the atmosphere of the levels and the actual gameplay, rather than the cinematic events and story-telling that would be featured later.  Some games such as GRAW 1 and 2 for PC and Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising tried to recapture this sort of style, and did so admirably but were never as influential as the previous titles as they weren't able to gain the traction and acclaim that their predecessors had done so seemingly with ease.\n\nUnfortunately, as the last game of the "classic" tactical shooter era, it's not all that great.  The AI can become glitchy and shoot walls, some lights sear right through the textures and you can see them from anywhere on the map (this is a rare glitch, thankfully), and planning your own routes and picking each individuals gear is completely absent.  Instead, you're given a preset path which you can choose to follow (you often probably should, since it feels as if the missions are designed around following these paths, and if you stray off the path, you'll often find nothing of interest.  Instead of choosing each soldiers load out, you pick "kits" for the whole team, which are pretty diverse, but picking your own gear is much preferred.  As for the AI, you'll often see your team mates shooting walls, trying to get at enemies, and they won't budge until the enemy is dead, or they die.\n\nSo how, how can I recommend this game despite all this?  Well, for one, the HUD is very neat and tidy.  There are a few squad commands at your disposal which work quite well and is very easy to adjust.  The missions have a nice flow to them and are quite addicting.  While not as large in scope as Ghost Recon's, they offer interesting settings with very nicely detailed environments which the mappers clearly at least TRIED to make feel "realistic".  Some of the very first levels you play are actually quite memorable.  In terms of replayability, the game is largely more linear than in the previous titles I've mentioned here, but again, it tries to make things more interesting with the nicely detailed levels and memorable settings.  The graphics are quite nice, but are tarnished by the "sweat" effects which replace the brutal blood and gore you'd see in Ghost Recon after firing on enemies (though thankfully there's mods which replace the sweat with blood).\n\nOverall, the sum of its parts adds up to a game with a more linear structure to the levels which makes the overall gameplay feel faster paced, with a lot of the more complex features of the previous titles either being skimped over, or altered/simplified for ease of play.  If you're looking for a game with memorable settings, decent gameplay, and is easy to get into, I would recommend this to you.  If you're new to the tactical shooter genre, I would also recommend this to you.  And thats where its strengths are, it services both groups while still managing to be fun.  It's not better, but it doesn't necessarily need to be.","May 3","true","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
