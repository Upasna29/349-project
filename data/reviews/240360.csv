Don Bluth as usual has beautiful art\n\n2. New areas to play on like Eden's Garden for example\n\n3. Good voice acting\n\n4. New bad guys to fight\n\nCons:\n\n1. Not as hard as the original Dragon's Lair\n\n2. Pointless item collecting just to reach the last level\n\n3. unlimited lives\n\n4. The game forces you to restart the entire level again if you ♥♥♥♥ up (In the original if you ♥♥♥♥ up you lose 1 life & you restart at the checkpoint not the entire level but if you lose 2 more lives it's game over)\n\nOverall this sequel was only average but I enjoyed my time with it but if your really nit picky about the price then I suggest waiting for a sale if your curious about it. (If I missed anything please feel free to leave feedback)","May 2, 2014","true","6.4"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

Not as well known as it's predecessor or Space Ace, yet is every bit as good. I remember the coin-op being significantly easier than the original Dragon's Lair, thanks to a lot of visual clues as to where and when to move or use your sword... and i mean much more obvious clue than there usually were in the first game, mostly flashing sections a-la Ye Boulderss, Ye Rapids. If you were a fan of the original Dragon's Lair then you simply MUST buy this, regardless of whether you played Dragon's Lair II as a coin-op or not...","October 26, 2013","true","0.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tomfunny/recommended/240360/","tomfunny","SuperFunnyBros","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tomfunny/","31 products in account","The ambitious sequel to the innovative arcade game by Don Bluth and his team. The squeaky eye-candy princess Daphne has been kidnapped by the evil Mordroc, who apparently wants to marry her for some unknown reason. While the entire first game took place in the castle, in this one, you travel through 6 different timelines by using a unique flying time machine.\n\nAnother change is this game plays more like an interactive movie; inputing the correct commands to progress through the level as it goes. I am not entirely sure what the difficulty was on the first game, but this one is pretty difficult, especially when you turn off the move guides which serve as the game's training wheels. Then you have to solely rely on the yellow flashes to figure out what direction to go or when to use your sword. To make matters worse, except in the first level, if you mess up, you will restart to the beginning of the level. So you'll need good memorization skills in order to succeed, especially when turning off the move guide to get two achievements.\n\nThere are also treasures hidden in each level, which flash yellow when you're nearby. Input the correct direction to obtain the item. You have to collect all the treasures before reaching the final level or else the game will make you restart at the level(s) where you missed them. So overall, this game is a big step-up from the first one; the animation is improved in glorious Don Bluth style, the levels are distinctive to each other, and an increase in difficulty. If you played Dragon's Lair or any laser disc arcade game before, or you are a fan of Don Bluth movies (like me), or you just want a challange, I highly recommend this game.","March 27, 2014","true","8.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chuunks/recommended/240360/","Chuunks","Chuunks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chuunks/","211 products in account","This game has a nostalgic pull from my youth, I played a good amount of #1 - but my local arcade never got #2.  So on the few occasions when I did see it, I would watch with rapt attention as others played.\n\nI was excited to finally be able to play through this, but it lacks the charm and repeat play of the first game in a bad way.  Sequences are long, repetitious and unforgiving, if you miss one step you start must at the beginning of the scene - which makes failing the last few steps in a sequence rage inducing.  There is no incentive to play the game twice as the story is linear, the only change being the potential of a sequence being a mirror image of itself (left/right swapped).\n\nI personally didn't get to enjoy the story as I had to glaze my eyes a bit to look for the up/down/left/right/sword interaction.\n\nThis game thrived on being cool technology for the time, now it will feed on the nostalgia from our youths.","March 7, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The story line is anti-climactic and it doesn't have nearly as much charisma. The game fails to give any sense of accomplishment or reward upon completion as the ending is uninspired.\n\nA good point to mention is that the publisher did leave out a lot of the gripes that the game caused in the arcade, for example they actually do let you go back to collect the treasures instead of forcing you to start the game over again. It's not a classic, but it's not a throw away either. It's also not worth $9.99. I got mine on sale for $6.49.\n\nRating: 2.5/5.0","January 5, 2014","false","2.5"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

You'll be asked repeatedly to retry 3min long button sequences and if you screw up, you have to start all over again from the beginning. This is not fun. Dragon's Lair and Space Ace are the better games to go for. Dragon's Lair 2 leaves you feeling cheated most of the time, which will frustrate you. One example, is when you progress through half or more of the entire game, only to be notified you missed one fo the bonus treasures. So now you have to start ALL THE WAY FROM THE BEGINNING of the game because you missed hidden button presses. That's complete bull**it.\n\nIt's fun for the novelty, but if you want a fun experience, avoid this and stick to Dragon's Lair or Space Ace.","July 23, 2015","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RoberTime/recommended/240360/","RoberTime","RoberTime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RoberTime/","55 products in account","NOTE: Scroll down for summary and rating\n\nIf you haven't played Dragon's Lair 2, or any of the Don Bluth games in general, imagine a cartoon animation fused with Geometry Dash. Highly difficult, fast reactions, trial and error, and memory. Dragon's Lair 2 is a challenging full motion video game where you must push the arrow keys and space bar at the right moment.\n\nThe story continues from the first Dragon's Lair. After the protagonist Dirk the Daring freed Princess Daphnie from the dark magic of the Dragon's Lair, she gets kidnapped by the evil wizard Mordoc, and must use a time machine, which is oddly the nicer brother of Mordoc and talks. He must travel through different time zones and worlds to save Daphnie once again.\n\nIn gameplay, your mission is to push a button according to where a yellow flashing light appears. You have less than a second to react. The button depends on which direction it is from Dirk, the player character, or if Dirk's sword is flashing. If so, use the space bar. For experience, I too found the game pretty challenging. One death and you start over a level. Major levels are about a minute long each, the first level has two checkpoints, and the last two are pretty short. I ALWAYS play without a move guide for the most thrilling game experience. Just like what Nostalgia Critic stated in his review of Dragon's Lair, it's cheating! Without the guide, reaction times are quite slim. However, if you replay some levels and get used to the moves, it shouldn't be that stressful, especially if you are forced to replay the whole game if it tells you you missed a special "Treasure", which brings us to the next feature. Each level has at least one treasure item that flashes with the next move. Collect them all to enter the level were you fight Mordoc. There are also two modes called "Original" and "Director's Cut". In Original, you HAVE to collect all treasures to proceed to the Mordoc fight. In Director's Cut, the treasures are not required, but grants an alternate, easier Mordoc fight when they are all collected. One last thing about level gameplay, most of the levels have a chance to be mirrored, making it harder and disorienting if you played the level before.\n\nFor presentation, Don Bluth directed and animated the FMV for this game. Bluth was the legendary animator for some of our favorite nostalgic movies like Land Before Time and An American Tail, and he was called down to do a series of games by Digital Leisure, like this one! The level concepts are really clever and creative. Seeing how Dirk travels through different time zones, there are typical eras like the Prehistoric Times fighting flying creatures. There are even crazier-looking levels like the one where Dirk slides "Through the Looking Glass" into Wonderland! This is one of the most innovative video games I have played, and love it. This is why I like replaying  this game. I'm not only watching an animation, I'm playing it!\n\nTo conclude, the game is okay. The appearance is outstanding and really takes me back to when I saw "All Dogs Go to Heaven" and "Bartok the Magnificent" as a kid, which were other movies he did by the way. But I do think it should be longer, or the price lower, speaking of price, I purchased this on sale and so should you, my opinion. Bluth is also trying to get back to animation and developing a Dragon's Lair movie. I sure hope he does it!\n\nI rate this game 8/10. To summarize: Great animation, innovative gameplay, creative concepts, but a bit too high for price and a bit too short for length.","February 19","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
