For just $1 at the moment (as part of a groupees bundle) its good value for money and just the sort of mindless fun you sometimes need. The mouse control seemed like a good idea but to be honest activating the special clones via the keys is so much easier. The interface is simple and clean and once you get the hang of the different clones its a good way to while away time.\n\nCan get a little annoying on some levels when the exit point doesn't beam your guys up (Sometimes the detection is a bit off) but there is a nice tutorial for every level in case you get stuck which shows you how you should do it.","May 21, 2014","true","0.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","1"

Years later when i started LAN gaming i wanted to relive that gameplay but sadly discovered that there was no networked (or even modern) version available - so i decided to create one and convinced a friend to help.\n\nClones is our tribute to the Lemmings-style, with modern features like leaderboards, map editor, various gamemodes, team multiplayer, and co-op for singleplayer puzzles.  Multiple checkpoints can be set so you can explore different solutions to the puzzles without having to do parts of the level over again.  I prefer the the multiplayer for the strategy and quick thinking - just like the old days! :)","December 16, 2010","true","553.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

A VERY good Lemmings clone (maybe calling the game "Clones" was a joke in itself? I'd love the developers if that was the explanation.), which has multiplayer too, so you can virtually get an infinite bundle of enjoyment out of it.\nThe general look of the game is a little more cold and sterile than good ol' Lemmings, but it's not that bad! Clones make it up a bit with their cuddly cuteness.\n\nIf you are in search for some suicidal-critters nostalgia without having to deal with outdated graphics and outrageously low resolutions, then this game will be your cup of tea.","July 9, 2014","true","1.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
