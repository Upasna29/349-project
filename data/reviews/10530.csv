The story is fantastic, with hints of Mass Effect, Dead Space and Deus Ex: HR. Those who enjoy those games will probably love this.\n\nThe game is a little old, it was released in 2008, and the control system is definitely a little dated. Everything else is generally great, but if you are going to play I would highly recommend you ensure that you had a way to use the keybinds ingame (especially Map, Health Pack and "Collect all loot", these are imperative). Sadly, the game has no method of rebinding keys, so this might be a chore. I use a Razer Naga and bound the imperative keys to the sidebuttons and it worked like a treat.\n\nI can't emphasise this enough, this game is fantastic! It took me 8-9 hours to fully complete the game, while collecting the sub-story Data Pads, and loved every minute of it. Again, if you liked games such as Mass Effect, Deus Ex: HR, Dead Space, with the playstyle of Diablo 3, you'll enjoy this game a lot.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nNilesy","August 10, 2014","true","8.7"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","21","21","0","0"

But if you try, sometimes you get what you need.”\n\nAt first sight Space Siege looks like a top-down shooter with interesting physical effects and multiple weapons you can customize. However, a closer look at these features reveals that there is only one melee weapon and the rest of your ranged weapons only differ from each other in terms of damage and firing rate (lacking tactical variety).\n\nThe controls feel awkward and lack precision. In addition, the inability to change the keyboard mapping should be seen as a below-average gameplay feature nowadays.The characters are displayed in a stereotypical way and remain simple points of story related elements. Your only companion, in form of an android, will stay silent during your entire journey.\n\nFurther shortcomings are the lack of side quests and dismal layout of levels. The cybernetic choices are a bit more meaningful, but its implementation feels rushed and unbalanced.\n\nOverall, Space Siege is a simple game with monotonous gameplay. It leaves too much to be desired, in order to be recommended.\n\nAchievements:\n\nThe game has no Steam achievements.\n\nChronology:\n\nSpace Siege (PC)\nTop-down shooter\n(Science-Fiction) – 2008","September 2, 2014","false","13.0"," 25 of 40 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","25","40","0","2"

With fluid combat gameplay and light-RPG mechanics, Gas Powered Games managed to craft a unique but short story-driven experience. There are plenty of upgrades to pick from, and hordes of enemies to blast through. The combat itself is heavily action-based with little real strategy involved, and the more memorable aspect of this game for me was actually the choices between whether or not to cybernetically enhance myself. The game reminds you, in no uncertain terms, that enhancing yourself will make you vastly more powerful but that each enhancement will also slowly deprive you of your very humanity.\n\nSo I ask you again: is your humanity worth dying for?","June 22, 2014","true","11.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

However, all I can say is that the game feels as mediocre as they get. Generic combat, generic corridors, generic enemies, generic humans vs aliens story.\n\nMost of the gameplay is an isometric shooter. Point at an enemy with your mouse and shoot. Seems like controls are simple enough. However, the enemies shoot back at you, and your only way to avoid getting shot is to roll dodge, and you have to aim it with the mouse in the direction you want to roll. So somehow you have to manage to shoot and roll dodge at the same time with just 1 mouse. And then we also get the annoying camera rotation, which is inverted. When I want to rotate left, it rotates right, and vice versa. Maybe there's a way to change this, but I didn't see it.\n\nYou get a robot companion too, but it's just a regular sidekick really who acts as an extra gun in battle. You can give him a few basic commands, like attack, defend, and heal, and you can upgrade his stats just as you can upgrade your own, but there's nothing much else to it. You can probably play the whole game without ever using it.\n\nYou can also get cyber implants and use skill points to improve your abilities, but it's all presented in a very generic and uninteresting way. Nearly every skill is a passive which just improves your damage or a critical chance by a couple of % and that's it. Not to mention, half of the abilities require you to have a specific cyber implant, and from what I've played so far, I've only found the one for the eye, so there are plenty of abilities in my upgrades menu that I can't use yet, and no idea when I will.\n\nThe fact that enemies all look and act alike, makes every single battle feel the same. Throw a couple of grenades into the group and fire away till naught's left. Rinse and repeat. But then fighting enemies isn't so bad when you consider that 95% of the time you're walking and backtracking with nothing happening.\n\nYou might enjoy this game if you're into dungeon crawlers with no story and simply need to play every single one out there, but otherwise I wouldn't really recommend it.","July 14, 2015","false","3.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It's clearly a Gas Powered game, remnants of the previous Dungeon Siege "surprise mechanics" are present though this is quite different in terms of combat as you're in full control rather than watching and managing.  I would have preferred a leveling system and random gear than the linear progression the game provides, that would have allowed much more flexibility though I can see where it wouldn't make much sense given how short the game is.  If I had one complaint it would be that the game feels like one big marketing campaign for the period sensitive Ageia PhysX, while that was entertaining at first there was so much of it that I couldn't help but think the game was made for PhysX rather than it being a feature of the game.  Nevertheless I'm glad I played it, it was certainly entertaining for the 10 hours it took to complete.  If you're a fan of the late Gas Powered Games then you likely enjoy this as well.","February 9, 2014","true","10.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smerlus/recommended/10530/","smerlus","smerlus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smerlus/","363 products in account","Space Siege is a game where I can barely recommend. It’s playable, has some interesting ideas behind it however the bland environments and the annoyingly repetitive nature of the game play prevents it from rising beyond a mediocre Diablo clone set in space.\n\nThe game thrusts players in the role of Seth Walker, a security office on space ship that is escaping a genocidal attack by a race of killer insect-like aliens. Things start off looking abysmal for the surviving members of the ship but Walker proves to be a capable fighter and is set out alone to look for survivors and find a way to get the aliens off the ship.\n\nThe interesting ideas that I mentioned earlier take the form of weapons and a robot sidekick that can be upgraded and the most impressive part is the upgrading of Seth himself. The player can choose to add cybernetic enhancements to Walker to increase his effectiveness of destroying the alien scourge on the ship but the only downside is that he loses his humanity with every part replaced by machine. This doesn’t seem like much by itself but it works into the narrative and it’s pretty important since the ship’s AI is helping humanity make its final stand but also has its own plan for the surviving members.\n\nUnfortunately that’s about it for the exciting parts of the game. You’ll fight through numerous parts of the ship against hundreds of copies of the same enemy’s that pretty much all act the same way for about 12 hours until the game is completed. The story does branch out near the end depending on some decisions made throughout the game or in the end but there’s really nothing groundbreaking here.\n\nThe fellow survivors are decent so the game isn’t a total downer even though they are a bit too formulaic. They each have their own point of view that mirrors the end decision. It’s just a shame that the weapons and the humanity/cybernetic choice don’t really make killing the same enemies over and over again any more exciting. The environement's cut and paste feeling doesn't help to add to the variety either\n\nLike I mentioned, I barely recommend this game. It’s up to you to decide if a fairly predictable story with some interesting gameplay elements outweighs 12 hours of tedious destruction of a brainless and uninteresting enemy. It did for me…kind of.\n","August 16, 2014","true","12.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Along the way I opted to upgrade myself part-by-cybernetic-part, trading my humanity in for better stats. From the beginning, the game makes it appear the choice to upgrade or not is an important decision. The upgrade station gives you a running % of how much of your humanity is left and other characters will attempt to persuade your decision for and against. Ultimately it doesn't matter. I finished the game with 20% of my humanity left (I missed the chest upgrade somewhere along the way), and it affected the ending in no discernible way.\n\nSpace Siege is an enjoyable game. Combat is fun and satisfying. Finding parts for and upgrading your robot buddy HRV adds to the game in a good way. The story throws a couple of twists your way and provides good motivation for your character minus the plot holes left by your choice of cybernetic upgrades.\n\nHaving said that, I can only recommend Space Siege to fans of the genre. It does nothing truly spectacular. An average game. Get it on sale or not at all.","January 3, 2013","false","10.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

After having finished the game, I have to amend my original review.  The control scheme took very little time to get used to and I actually like it now.  As for the level design and enemies, this game did as well as most any I've played - there were enough different enemies to keep it interesting and though there was not a ton of variation in environment, the levels were still each unique enough to make it fun.\n\nThe plot is cool, for a game that's designed to be linear, not an open world for exploring.  I definitely like the upgrade system - if you're diligent about destroying everything for upgrade parts, you'll have more than enough to upgrade yourself, all your weapons, and your robotic companion.  The skill tree is pretty cool - it's important to note that you will not get enough points to fill out the entire skill tree so you have to make some choices about what's best suited to your playing style.\n\nOne issue I had at a few points during the game is the path-finding ability of the companion robot, though he was able to follow most of the time.  Beyond that, I really have no complaints and it was enough fun that I will likely play through again.\n\n-----------------------\nOriginal Review:\n-----------------------\nI've only played for a little over an hour - just the first couple of missions - and I can see what some of the negative reviews are talking about.  The two main issues seem to be the bad control scheme and repetitive level design.\n\nFirst, the control scheme is pretty wonky - it kind of reminds me of Harbinger, a 2003 action RPG developed by Silverback Entertainment and published by Dreamcatcher Interactive.  It would play a lot better with WASD movement like the Halo games Spartant Assault and Spartan Strike.  Second, I can already see some repetitive design in the environment and the enemies.\n\nDespite these issues, I'm really enjoying the game so far.  I like the (admittedly simple) skill tree and the weapon/armor upgrade system.  It's certainly not an in-depth system you'd expect out of a more hardcore RPG but it's a nice, light, action RPG, reminiscent of games like Diablo.  It would be nice to be able to carry more than four health packs but that's pretty minor.  Overall, I find it to be a good time-waster of a game.  I suppose my opinion might change as I get further into the game but, so far, it's been a lot of fun.","November 30, 2015","true","47.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
