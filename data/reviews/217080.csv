"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gerivaz/recommended/217080/","gerivaz","Vit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gerivaz/","266 products in account","Doctor Who….. A franchise that spans 50 years, with over 750 episodes, tons of books, a massive fanbase which, as of the last few years has grown ridiculously and an array of famous actors and writers. Making a videogame out of it sounds like a good idea. A bunch of cash is generated from sales and some new fans are brought aboard as well.\nHowever, if there’s one thing the videogame industry has never exceled at, is making videogames based on movies and TV series. And I don’t know which is worse: if the fact that a big Hollywood movie nowadays implies a videogame counterpart, or the fact that those counterparts always feel like they were made using the last remnants of the movie budget, and on a Sunday afternoon.\nDW:TEC, of course, is crippled by this cash-grabbing  mind-set and thus suffers considerably in most regards. But it does manage to get some things right. Let’s take a look.\n\nThe plot here is simple at first. Something or someone is causing a temporal maelstrom, and it’s up to the Doctor to stop it from tearing up time and space. Well, in a way, it’s mostly up to the TARDIS, since the poor girl acts as a plug, keeping the many holes in the fabric of time closed. Consequently, the TARDIS becomes slightly omnipresent. “Slightly omnipresent?” Well, yeah, since there are several time rifts and she’s keeping them closed, she is wherever there are any of those, which is….in several places simultaneously. Needless to say, moving her isn’t such a good idea in these conditions, so the Doctor is forced to use several time corridors that seem to pop out of nowhere with an unsettling accuracy, both time and space-wise.\nJust as expected of a mess of this nature, along the way, the Doctor will face all of the major enemies of the most recent seasons, Cybermen, Daleks, the Silence and so on, each chapter being dedicated to outsmarting and defeating each one of these. All of this of course, while you go on with your quest of saving the universe once again and still be home in time for dinner.\n\nSoon enough, you will most likely run into problems. Due to the 2-player nature of the game, and due to the fact that when you’re playing single your companion is as AI, several puzzles involving both players quickly become frustrating. Sometimes the AI will take too long to do what it’s supposed to do, or sometimes it might get stuck, meaning it won’t do anything at all, forcing you to restart from the last checkpoint. There’s also the fact that the enemy AI seems weird, being completely unable to notice you as long as they don’t face you, but if they do they will detect you even if there’s a thick wall between you and them. Some controls aren’t intuitive at all, especially elevator controls: some require you to use the sonic screwdriver, some others require you to just push up or down and others require you to press the action button. This might seem minor, but an inconsistency of this kind becomes a major annoyance, since you will be riding a lot of elevators and platforms.\nOn the other side of things, we have the configurations. The video options menu won’t save your chose settings, so you are forced to use the default graphic profiles (Low, Medium or High), which is also annoying (changing the config file directly had no effect whatsoever), and frequently, you will notice popping textures.\n\nThe puzzles are all pretty mediocre and easy even on the highest difficulty. The mind map puzzles were the most interesting idea out of all the challenges present here, but even those are easy to figure out. In here you have to correctly align an image in a circle by rotating its sections. In easy mode that’s literally all you need to do but in higher difficulties each section you rotate will simultaneously rotate other sections, each in a different manner, thus increasing the challenge. The platforming element is decent and for any Doctor Who fan, using the screwdriver to unlock doors and other shenanigans feels delicious. Too bad that is everything you will use in this game (besides River’s gun).\n\nStill I can’t help but feel that this is quite a cheap cash-in. There was so much that could be done, and yet, we are left with a hollow game that consists in jumping across platforms, sneaking past enemies, and solving a few easy puzzles across the way. The collectibles don’t really add much to it, but at least there are several achievements for timed runs which will most likely make you do certain sections more than once. Good thing all sections are pretty small and can usually be done in under 10-12 mins each.\n\nAnother very disappointing point in this game is the TARDIS herself. How could such an important element of the whole DW universe be shoved aside and just used as a cheap way to have a simplified plot? Fiddling with the inside of the TARDIS would have been a dream for any DW fan, since there are endless possibilities as to what can be found inside (as seen in Season 7’s “Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS”). The control room is so pretty and detailed, and yet it’s used for nothing. The ONLY thing you do inside the TARDIS in this game is…….walk out of it.\n\nDespite all its flaws, the game manages to get some stuff right. The ability to point your sonic screwdriver and use it to mess up with stuff is pretty damn funny, and it's pretty cool to personally evade and defeat the Daleks in a post-apocalyptic London, while listening to Matt Smith's occasional witty one-liners. That being said, some stuff, like the overall looks of Dr. River Song were totally uncalled for and are just a petty fan-service attempt.\nSo, in conclusion, if you’re not a DW fan and you’re just looking for a platforming game…….don’t bother. There are so many better alternatives out there for you, and this one doesn't really stand out. If you’re a big DW fan like me, go ahead and give it a try, you might like it.","November 28, 2013","true","17.0"," 103 of 115 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","103","115","7","0"

The behaviour, dialouges and the Doctor's comments on situations and remarkable things are 100% convincing ^^\nThe game is a funny little plattformer. I needed less than 5hours for one runthrough without any problems. Most riddles and puzzles are self-explanatory and there are wonderfully straight to the point explanations for the mini-games.\nI recommend playing with a gamepad, because - in my opinion - it makes especially lockpicking with your screwdriver a lot easier and faster, but it's probably a matter of habit ; )\nI, personally, enjoyed this game, although it does not have this depth, length and high-end graphic a really great Doctor Who-game would actually deserve. But in some ways it summarizes all important elements that contributed to the enormous success of the Doctor's fascination during the past 5 decades. All these incredibly athmospheric scenarios taking place in contrary eras of mankind featuring most of the creatures, the Doctor met during his journeys (except for Weeping Angels, unfortunately xD).\nSome users complain about River Song's inadequate AI. I played this game March 2013 and did not notice any of those problems.\n\n~Conclusion~\nOne should not expect a high-end game. It is rather a little adorable game for in between that completes your Doctor Who Collection and lets you smile about all those allusions to the Doctor's adventures ^^","July 12, 2013","true","10.6"," 74 of 80 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","74","80","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/recommended/217080/","ashdot","Callietrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/","1456 products in account","Doctor Who: The Eternity clock stars, obviously, the Doctor and River Song from the 2010 Series of Doctor Who starring Matt Smith as the Doctor. He starts out after an anomaly in time stuck inside a Bank and must find his way out. Alternatively - the character River Song, starts out on a Prison as she has to make her way across the prison, get her stuff back and meet up with the Doctor in the timeline he's stuck on. It's a very 'Doctor Who' premise, which I really enjoyed.\n\nOne thing that must be noted, however  - YOU WILL MOST LIKELY NOT ENJOY THE GAME AS MUCH IF YOU ARE NOT A FAN OF THE SERIES. This may seem obvious, but in all honesty - unlike games like TellTale's The Walking Dead series, you don't need to be a fan of the series /original source content to understand what's going on as it's pretty self absorbed as a story - this game is not. The game very largely depends on you having seen the show and understand who the Doctor and River Song are and why they do what they do - otherwise clever references made in nod to the show (which are a lot of them) will whizz right by you and you'll most likely end up feeling like you're missing something crucial. There is no "self absorbed" Character Development with either the Doctor or River, it is literally like an episode of the show.\n\nThe visuals are pretty serviceable. The Doctor and River, and of course the TARDIS are really well textured and done, but I feel the rest of the game was lacking that touch of polish. Some areas look very muddy, while some look like they weren't textured at all. Some NPC models had about the same issue - notably the Cybermen models - whom looked like a pretty standard mesh without textures and 'plastic-y'. The sound, however is masterful. Everything sounds like it has given special attention to care, even the voices to an extent. There's a lot to love if you're already a fan of the music found in the show like this theme which plays quite a few times during the game as well as the Title Screen having the full version of the 2010 show's theme.\n\nThe game play is very simple. The game is set to be a puzzle-platformer, a pretty standard one, but it works for what it tries to achieve. The puzzles aren't particularly tough to figure out, but some "mini game" sequences (like to activate consoles, open doors or work computers to unlock passageways, etc) are amazingly tedious at times - given the fact that they overuse them a lot.\n*~> One has you redirecting "energy" lines to their sources, without them 'overlaying' so they "overcharge" the source, you do this by opening and closing lines/pipes. Usually these are done in multiple stages, they being timed - so if you run out of time and the puzzle is not complete - it will reset itself.\n*~> Another one involves you opening and closing "gates" as blue and red energy flows down some lines - you need to open the gates for the blue source to pass and close gates to dissipate red sources - ultimate they culminate in a bar that you must fill up with blue source energy. This puzzle is, by far, the most aggravating nonsense I have ever played. On harder difficulties - the red sources come out so fast at times they they can confuse you as to which line they are coming through so you end up unblocking a wrong gate, or a blue source comes down so fast you don't have enough time to unblock it's gate, and if a red source hits, the screen shakes a lot allowing for some confusion as more sources keep trickling down - by far my LEAST favourite of the minigames - but these are NOT done in stages, however these are used a lot more towards the end of the game.\n*~> Another mini game has you moving a small dot across a field of red dots that will "kill" your dot and force you to restart the field again - the field is usually divided in 3 sections, the outer side having the most space and most time to move your dot, a safe zone on between, a smaller zone beneath it, and then towards the center - you have less margins for error. Think of this minigame like "Frogger" in a sense. This one was, by far, the one I enjoyed the most. While it was being used a lot towards the end of game as well - this one never got too overwhelming or overly tedious that it crippled my enjoyment of the game.\nThere is an additional mini puzzle that comes in the way of matching waves in size, lenght and pattern, which involves the Sonic Screwdriver. You'll be doing this one a lot as well, as it is used for unlocking doors and occasionally defeating enemies.\n\nOn the "Platformer" side of things - there's not much to say. The Doctor and River handle fairly well. There's a bit of a stiffness to movement though, and it'll show more if you have to do a neutral jump (jumping without direction) because it's hard to get to ledges that aren't too far off you, but aren't close enough for you to grip on to them. Other than that, sometimes you move some crates and such to get to higher places - it's all very standard stuff here, but it works. River herself has a few different tools, like her gun, which you use the Right Stick on a controller to aim and RT to shoot - or use the mouse to hover and click to shoot - which you'll be using in a few segments during the game. I also have to give a special mention to the AI in the game... it is pretty horrendous. I had issues where River got stuck not jumping somewhere or not following (she is needed at times for dual puzzles) and the enemies break immersion a lot since as SOON as you're out of sight - they can still latch on to you (look at you) but won't chase you and give up and leave.\n\nAs far as replay value goes - unless you're already a Doctor Who fan, or are a completionist, there's not much incentive to replay the game. Sure, it has 3 stages of difficulty to beat the game through at, and a fair amount of item collectibles - such as the Doctor's many hats (as seen on the show) or River's diary pages (Spoilers!) but the tedious puzzles found in between may very well turn you off trying to beat the game again if it didn't already turn you off beating the game in the first place.\n\nAll in all though, I am a bit biased going into this review as I do love the show a lot, so obviously I got more into the notion of the game - however if you're not a fan of the show - AT ALL - or a fan of very standard, bare bones puzzle platformers I would honestly say "Skip this one."\n\nPros:\n+Amazing Sound Design\n+Very true to Source Material (References & Nods, Art style)\n+Story is pretty cool\n+Some puzzles can be fun\n\nCons:\n-Terrible AI\n-Poor stealth mechanics\n-Puzzles can get tedious and awfully random\n-Stiff movement\n-No replay value","January 27, 2014","true","8.6"," 48 of 57 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","48","57","0","4"

The story itself isn't a bad little romp, although it does leave you hanging a bit at the end. You get to see several popular monsters from Doctor Who, and the Doctor's running commentary is pretty enjoyable.\n\nThe bad: The AI is occasionally dreadful. At certain points, you play as the Doctor and River's character is supposed to follow along and assist you. However, she tends to run the wrong way and get stuck in weird places. Sometimes you can get her unstuck, and sometimes you end up having to restart the level. The controls are pretty clunky as well. It's sometimes difficult to get the Doctor to jump where you want him to, and dodging Cybermen is trickier than necessary.\n\nGeneral info: This is a side-scroller with occasional puzzle mini-games. You mostly play as the Doctor, although you have a few rounds in which you play as River Song. The story was meant to be the first part in a series, but the others weren't made, so the game leaves you hanging a bit at the end.\n\nOverall: I recommend this if you are a fan of Doctor Who and will just enoy having more content with the Eleventh Doctor and River Song. The gameplay is nothing to write home about, but it's an enjoyable way for a DW fan to spend an afternoon.\n\nSystem Specs Used: Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 670M / 3GB GDDR5, DDRIII 12GB RAM, Windows 7","December 8, 2014","true","10.0"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","20","20","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dommiesgrl/recommended/217080/","dommiesgrl","dommiesgrl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dommiesgrl/","80 products in account","TL;DR - The "Doctor Who" bits are good; the "video game" bits are bad.\n\nTHE LONG VERSION - The Eternity Clock is a game that had a lot of potential, but sadly fell short of the mark, mostly due to seemingly nit-picky problems with the mechanics of the game. The story isn't stellar, but the voice acting is good (of course) and it was engaging enough to make me want to continue until the end of the game.\n\nOverall, my complaint is the gameplay. First of all, the controls aren't particularly smooth, although I did get used to it after a while. Second of all, why make a completely 3D world, then doom the player to view all of it from the side? As hilarious as it is to watch the Doctor flailing around in profile as he jumps from box to box, it seems a bit counter-intuitive to produce a Doctor Who game in which strict limitations are imposed on the player. I'm not just talking about the sidescroll here; the story may be timey-wimey, but everything else is extremely linear. Even the puzzles, which should ideally be the heart and soul of a puzzle game, fall short in terms of creativity and difficulty. Instead of layering complexity or requiring the player to think outside the box, the player must contend with shorter time limits which simply require them to complete the same easy puzzle, just faster than they did before. This led me to a lot of frustrating moments where I felt that the puzzle completion was pointless, but I had to soldier on because it was required to progress the game.\n\nSpeaking of those time limits I mentioned earlier, did I mention that the countdowns don't stop while looking at the instructions for a puzzle? One scenario in the game required me to complete two puzzles, and I had to complete the second puzzle in the same amount of time it took me to finish the first. The problem was that I didn't know that ahead of time, and since the first puzzle was unfamiliar, I took my time perusing the instructions. All the while, the timer was ticking without my knowledge, and when it came time for me to complete the second challenge, I quickly realized that it would be impossible to succeed. It took me dying ten times to realize that my timer started on some arbitrary number, like 2:43, and I thought to reload a previous save and try the first puzzle again. That time, I sped through it all without a problem, but I was extremely annoyed to learn that I had wasted a lot of time on a technicality.\n\nI spent a great deal of the game waiting for an opportunity to be clever, but I never found one. Most actions/puzzles in the game are repetitive (problems are solved in similar ways throughout the entire game), and some are downright confusing due to the player not having enough information to complete them. Puzzles that stumped me ended up requiring simple solutions that I missed only because I didn't explore this or that location, or I didn't interact with this or that object. Other puzzles just seemed arbitrary, like those in the Time Corridor. I didn't feel like intelligence was required to advance; I never really had to figure anything out, and that's a problem in a puzzle game.\n\nIn my opinion, I think this is more of an adventure game with puzzles stuck on. The puzzles don't require thought; they require speed. The feeling of urgency that evokes in a game is good for certain moments of a story, but being consistently bombarded with "You must outrun X enemy in Y timeframe, or you will die" becomes both boring and frustrating. All in all, I liked the story, but the gameplay is irritating and replay value is nonexistent.\n\nLet's be honest, though. I believe the planned sequels for this game have been postponed indefinitely, but if they did come out, I'd still buy them because they have the name "Doctor Who" on them, even if the game was terrible. I know that those who buy a Doctor Who game aren't necessarily in it for the gameplay; they want the story. Still, if the developers want to use the video game medium to tell that story, it would behoove them to pay better attention to the mechanics of said game.","December 15, 2013","false","15.5"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

The experience as a whole is like playing any other platformer here you can't kill enemies. You have to time your jumps, cooperatively solve puzzles that involve both characters, and collect all the hats (which you can't wear, go figure) and all the journal pages (which you can't read either).\n\nThe game features voice acting from original actors, and shows the Eleventh Doctor and River Song trying to solve a mystery. Nothing too far from normal telly episodes on the BBC, to be honest.\n\nIt's a good story, but it isn't enough. It's just fun for wasting some time or for when you have to wait your buddies to play an online game.

I wanted to love this, after loving Doctor who the adventure games I thought that I would enjoy this. I began playing it for my youtube channel and cringed at how badly designed and frustrating some of these levels are. The bank level is very boring and gets on my nerves every time I play it as it doesn't showcase Doctor who games at their best. The second level was more on the right track as you control River and you have to escape the prison. I enjoyed this level alot and found it very enjoyable, but alas I was about to endure one of the worst poorly designed levels I've ever played in a video game. The cybermen level is terrible, after I played this mission I knew I just wasn't going to enjoy the rest of the game. I've tried given this one a shot a couple times but it's very different to "Doctor Who: The adventure Games". Go grab your $10 and save it up to buy Doctor who: The adventure games. This one was a miss I'm afraid.\n\nGameplay - 1 out of 5 (The second levels gameplay is fantastic and was on the right track, but the rest of the levels have terrible gameplay compared to it).\nCharacters - 3 out of 5 (The characters are played by the actual cast members, which is fantastic however the dialogue lets down the characters in this game)\nAliens - 1 out of 5 (Why do they have to use "The Daleks" and "The cybermen" why not use aliens or villians we fans haven't seen in the television series for a long time. Why not bring back "Omega"? Loads of classic "Doctor Who" fans would enjoy playing as Matt smith and defeating Omega!\n\nOverall this game was a miss. Go spend your 10 dollers on Undertale or ten hamburgers at Hungry Jacks. If you enjoyed this one than thats great! Why not say in the comments what part of the game you enjoyed most! I'd love to hear! Thanks for reading, I apologize for my terrible grammar! Goodbye!","April 26","false","3.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/san1281/recommended/217080/","san1281","sanitarian1281","http://steamcommunity.com/id/san1281/","1229 products in account","My favorite television show of all time has had a checkered history with videogame adaptations, as many television and movie franchises do. Leaving aside non-retail (The Adventure Games that were free for UK residents as part of the television license fee) and Nintendo releases, Doctor Who hadn't had a commercially-released game adaptation in 15 years until Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock was released in 2012 for PlayStation and PC. The original PS3 release did not win over critics (earning a depressing 39% over 21 reviews), and the PC port that came six months later received little attention and less acclaim.\n\nSome of this isn't necessarily Supermassive's fault; most of it is, but to some extent the game is a victim of excessively-high expectations. At its heart, TEC is a puzzle-platformer with a Doctor Who skin, so it's not necessarily the best kind of game to demonstrate the qualities that make DW so memorable and magical. It was suggested in one of the Cheapassgamer.com forums that a The Walking Dead-style adventure game (albeit one that relied a bit less on QTEs) would be a more suitable vehicle and I agree. None of the incarnations of the show in game form have even come close to capturing its essence and I believe that this is at least in part because an effective  character- and story-driven approach has not been tried (IMO, The Gunpowder Plot, the fifth and possibly last of the Adventure Games, came closest).\n\nInherent limitations of the genre aside (and this is not my favorite kind of game), despite some of the extra bug-stomping and tweaking that we may presume was partially responsible for the lengthy delay between the original publication and the PC and Vita ports, this game is still a pretty buggy and frequently frustrating experience. The biggest issues with the PC version are with your companion AI, specifically with River Song. In the game you will switch at various points between playing as River (usually with her blaster and vortex generator) and playing as the 11th Doctor (usually with his sonic screwdriver). Often there will be bits that require the character you're not currently playing to turn a wheel, hold a lever, or do some other similar cooperative action. Sometimes, instead, River will vanish completely (maybe because of something in her diary?) or she will get stuck in a loop of repeating actions for no apparent reason (this seems unlikely to be due to spoilers).\n\nThe other issues are that the game has certain chokepoints, both in a metaphorical sense and also in the sense that you will wish the developers were in the room with you so that you could step away from the keyboard and begin choking them and bashing their heads against the nearest wall, all the while asking, "Why? Why would you do this?" I identified four of these: evading Cybermen in the Underground, electrocuting Cybermen in the Underground, stealing the stasis field generator from the Silence, and obtaining the last piece of the Eternity Clock from the Daleks.\n\nOf these, the odds are that if you're much better at (or simply much faster at) puzzle-solving than I am, you won't have as much difficulty as I did with the Cyberman and Dalek parts. However, the Silence base area is worthy of special note. In keeping with the show's lore regarding this cult/race, River must keep at least one of the Silence in view at all times while she is running around disabling four separate stasis fields and finally stealing a stasis field generator. The problem with this area is that the Silence generally don't operate according to the same rules as the other enemies in the game. There are some static Silence that appear to be praying (?) and others that walk around on seemingly well-defined patrol routes. However, both types will randomly teleport away or otherwise simply disappear--and I do mean randomly.\n\nBetween these chokepoints, the game is a fairly enjoyable experience, especially for fans. The game tells the story of River and the Doctor's efforts to re-assemble parts of a mysterious temporal artifact known as the Eternity Clock after it begins creating time corridors at various points in Earth history and causing the TARDIS to behave erratically. Predictably, the pieces are in the hands of various enemies of the Doctor who are siphoning off the energy for their own purposes. River and the Doctor are voiced by Alex Kingston and Matt Smith, respectively, and they both turn in terrific performances. The game looks decent and the ambient sound effects and music are culled directly from the show.\n\n\nThe puzzles in the game are of about five basic types, most of which will be familiar to players of the Adventure Games. They include using binary switches to route or reroute steam or power in different ways; rotating pieces to direct the flow of energy from one point to another; rotating concentric rings of a wheel to form an unscrambled image; opening and closing gates to allow or block different kinds of energy from reaching a central point; and the ubiquitous waveform-matching oscilloscope puzzles used to open doors, disable devices, et cetera, with the sonic screwdriver.\n\nThe game isn't terribly long. I completed it in 10 hours and, as I said, I'm not especially good at these kinds of games. It's a tough experience to recommend unless you're a serious Doctor Who fan due to its generally unpolished nature and occasionally significant difficulty. The story ends on a bit of a cliffhanger (which I won't spoil here), implying that the developer and/or the BBC anticipated that there would be at least one sequel. However, given the dismal commercial and critical reception the game ultimately received, I don't expect that this is terribly likely.","January 5, 2014","false","10.1"," 30 of 55 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","30","55","0","0"

It has collectables, puzzles, achievements, and decent game-play.\n\nThroughout the game you can collect hats and diary pages, you cannot wear the hats, but you can observe them and get a line of dialogue from the Doctor with a reference or a joke. You can collect River's diary pages, which you can read or look at. These collectables are quite easy to find, and they give the game some replay value, simply just looking for the pages and hats. The achievements are also quite fun to aquire, some of them are hard, some of them are easy and unavoidable. These achievements really add to the replay value of the game.\n\nWhen you start the game there are three different diffuculties, easy, medium and hard, these diffculties affect the puzzles. The puzzles range from using the sonic screwdriver to open locks (and somehow stuning enermies) to moving a dot through a circular maze whilst avoding deadly dots, which is normally what happens when you hack into a system. There are heaps of these puzzles in the game, and they seem to be a big part of the game, and you will need to solve them quickly, as the game rarely pauses for you when you do them.\n\nThe game play is quite okay, it's not the best, but I have played worse. You can play two characters, Doctor River Song and The Doctor, River can shoot and kill things, because she is River and doesn't care about life, and the Doctor can somehow use his sonic screwdriver to not only unlock everything, but also stun just about any lifeform. This game is a platformer and has a lot of jumping and pushing things in it. There are a few glitches in the game, for example River song not being able to jump up a ledge (when you're playing the Doctor) and when she reaches the top jumps off, but they can be avoided. And there are some times when the game doesn't quite explain how to do something *cough* *cough* Elevator *cough* *cough*.\n\nThe only way for you to really enjoy this game, not to say that it's easy to hate, but it's hard to love, is if you are a Doctor Who fan. Because there are so few Doctor Who games out there, and the few that there are, aren't really all that good. And this one might not be terrible, but it's not all that great. But for it being a Doctor Who game I am going to have to give it points. I wish there was a way to give it a recommendation of in between yes and no, but there's not.","January 24","true","29.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I love that the baddies and what I love most about it is that River and the Doctor never have episodes of just them together, even though as the viewer we know that they must spend time together at some point other than what we see on the show. This game depicts an adventure that they must have in one of those periods where we aren't sure what the Doctor and River do together when they're alone. I love how the game makes connections to the story line of the show in little ways and through comments the characters make.

The ones that would take the main character from the source material and make him run through levels that are only vaguely based on scenes from that media, jumping over enemies and collecting items that were barely relevant?  Like the old Looney Toons games, where Bugs Bunny would have to collect carrots and dodge an inexplicable army of Elmer Fudds?\n\nThis is pretty much one of those games.\n\nThere are differences of course.  It's voice acted by all the right people, and a graphics engine that looks comparable to Trine when it's not doing a close up of Eleven or River.  The music is the same as the show, for better or worse.  At its heart, though, this game is just another one of those poorly-fitted side scrollers.  River has to search for the pages of her diary, which have been spread across earth for reasons even she lampshades as bizarre.  Eleven is constantly on the search for nicely-packed hats which seem to be speckled on alien ships and across a post-apocalyptic future, while pursuing the MacGuffin of the plot, which loosely strings as many of the Doctor's enemies together as possible.\n\nThe music, as in the show, continues to be high quality, though oddly used.  For example, they play the bombastic "I am the Doctor!" theme right through the beginning tutorial.  While that's a fun song, it felt very out of place of learning how to jump over crates.\n\nThe puzzles are the same hacking puzzles you've seen in every other video game ever - which is to say, they have nothing to do with electronics whatsoever.  Think Mass Effect and Bioshock's hacking puzzles, with a decent dose of crate puzzles.  Inoffensive, but also uninspired.\n\nMatt Smith, to this games great credit, seems to be enjoying the hell out of voice acting this game (or just being the Doctor in general).  Alex Kingston isn't quite as interested, but pulls off a competent performance.  Theres some co-op built into the game, which largely gets in the way, but does lead to a cool moment or two.\n\nOverall, this game isn't bad, but it sure isn't good either.  Don't expect too much from it other than a quick romp through space and time (mostly just time) with a cliffhanger that will never be fufilled.","November 3, 2014","false","6.2"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","15","30","0","0"

Personally, this deserves a middle button between the Yes and No recommend, but because of such a ballsed up puzzle section and a bad storyline I decided on the latter. I must warn you though; you probably won't like this game.\n\nThe game excels in it's platforming features. Never before in a Doctor Who game have we had 2D platforming with 3D elements, and the graphics are fairly decent. They aren't the best graphics but they're not exactly what you'd call a dogs dinner either. Full platform integration with Steam/Logitech controllers also makes the platforming a very enjoyable and smooth ride. The game is also a far leap from the Adventure Games series, something that will not be mentioned again because doing so will probably make my eyes bleed - what an awful games series.\n\nWhere this game fails though is the puzzles. It's like Doctor Who: The Adventure Games and Puzzle Quest decided to have a baby, but the baby inherited their worst features. The puzzle system does not integrate with the controller AT ALL, meaning you constantly have to keep moving from the keyboard to the controller in order to play the game. The puzzles lack a concept of entertainment and by the time the first one is completed they really become a chore.\n\nLast to mention is the storyline. Oh golly gosh the story line. Oh look, I'm trapped! Oh wait, River's come to my rescue almost coincidentally, and even more coincidentally there are some Cybermen down here. It feels like it was wrote by the pure anger of a runner up at a beauty pagent. It lacks context and meaning and sucks the life out of every character it touches. A bit like the Abzorbaloff.\n\nOverall, no. Don't get this game. Run for the fields of Trenzalor and go dig this game a grave. Because it needs it.","December 12, 2013","false","1.0"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","10","20","0","0"

However, in reality, I am left feeling as if I've thrown my money away in hopes of what might have been.\n\nEssentially, a mediocre platformer, with mostly not-difficult-at-all puzzles, framed in an uninspired Who-like story involving unnecessary time travel, and needless plot complications. Sure, there's Smith's voice-over, but in this game even they get boring.\n\nYou play as the Doctor and River Song, taking turns (as a single-player or local co-op) to solve the simple puzzles to unlock the next levels. As it may be evident, in my opinion - these puzzles are way to easy. Increasing the difficulty did not seem to challenge me any more significantly. It's worth noting here, that in the past, I've found games with simple, yet fun puzzles can be worthwhile and enjoyable (see: Machinarium). 'Twas not the case with Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock.\n\nThe level design was simple and easy to comprehend and solve with a cursory glance at your options. Each new level became increasingly tiresome as I was never presented with anything new, unusual, or interesting. The worst examples of this are the timed levels. Who enjoys running through a simple, slow paced, run and jump level as the enemy marches ever so slowly from off-screen? All in all, it felt as if the creative team was taking a nap.\n\nGameplay movement is as basic as it comes. Think 'Trine' without the beautiful (and surprisingly interactive) surrounding environment. The Doctor can run, and jump (although limited), he can hang and climb (a bit). Oh, yes, don't forget crawling. His trusty Sonic Screwdriver can levitate and move certain objects. This could easily be ANY basic platformer... this one simply has a Matt Smith texture to go along with its classic Who villains textures.\n\nGraphics are a middle-of-the-road 'okay'. Nothing to blow you away with realism, but the representations of wooden boxes, platforms, and floors was recognizable enough. The Doctor is definitely Smith in terms of appearance... but then again, hardly photo realistic either.  A solid 'meh' in terms of scoring.\n\nAudio? Well there IS the standard Who score for certain screens, but no real background score during actual gameplay. The voice acting is standard delivery by Matt and Alex, but could have been cut out from unrelated clips from the TV series rather than separately recorded for all the emotional depth it brings. Hard to imagine that there was any direction for the actors, nor any real desire to make this game as good as it could be.\n\nSo, gameplay is a solid 5/10 (no real flaws, but nothing to inspire and excite either), Graphics get another 5/10, followed by the lame audio (3/10). Story you ask? What story? Come up with any reason at all to have the Doctor skip around through time and jump through three levels of building to flip a switch. Your imagination is probably more compelling than this. (2/10).\n\nQuestion: Why does anyone want this game? Answer: They are a huge Doctor Who fan, and don’t mind throwing their hard earned cash at ANYTHING that has that logo.\n\nOverall - 4/10\n","March 3, 2014","false","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There's one major problem though. Part of the way through the game, in a crucial part where you're being chased by cybermen so you have limited time, the elevator you need to get up the floors doesn't work. This has left me unable to continue the game at all, and the only solutions I've seen are to reinstall or verify files and so on. Trying those, I did progress a little only for the storyline to go back to the same building and the elevator to not work even worse than before.

There's a lot of posts regarding shotty AI or glitched elevators but the reality is those are very very minimal, and a lot of times the frustration sets in b/c of the games lack of guidance on how to do things (ie: operate an elevator). Or you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥ River won't follow you through a gate you got open but if you work it out you realize she wasn't supposed to.\n\nThe dialogue is spot on for the show, the use of the sonic screwdirver for unlocking doors is clever and once you figure it out they add a new element. Suprisingly it can be a bit difficult (e.g. The Cybermen battle in the subway) but more often than not it's because you are overthinking what SHOULD happen as opposed to what you are supposed to do.\n\nI'd give it a solid 8/10 (keeping in mind it's a $10 game).","November 27, 2012","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a puzzle platformer with the Doctor Who title and theme.\nThough I wouldn't call it cliche, I'd say it isn't anything super unique.\n\nThe situational puzzles are decent. I got lost a few times, and I had no idea what to do, but that's the thing about puzzles that I like. But when I found out what to do, it turned out to be so obvious and easy that I felt stupid.\n\nThe in-game puzzles are too easy and are re-used from other sources. Also, there are specific scenes where if you're busy trying to solve a puzzle, some enemies might walk up to you and kill you, putting you back at your last checkpoint.\n\nI experienced frame-rate drops whenever I decided to rapidly fire my laser pistol or whenever I died.\n\nGraphics aren't the best, but nothing too bothersome.\n\nSounds and voices replay a bit too often.\n\nNo replay value, other than collecting diary pages that you can read and hats that have a quote from the Doctor.\n\nOverall; Watch someone play it. Don't play it yourself. If you're a fan of the series, the gameplay is not worth it, and the story isn't really too interesting.

But I think that it's really cool going from the present to the future to the past and to the future again, the dialogue is also hilarious. Something I liked but at the same time didn't like was (SPOILERS) it takes place in the same area of London throughout the game. Something I was really dissapointed by was that you can't pilot the TARDIS, or even explore it. I'd rate this game 11/10\nI wish this game was longer or that they had somehow fit the Sontarans into the game, though I did like the option to play the game with 2 people instead of 1. Currently I'm on a quest to get the remaining four hats missing from The Doctor's collection and six quarter pages of River Song's TARDIS journal. It's an awesome game plus you can shoot cybermen, cybermats, daleks, and even silence.
