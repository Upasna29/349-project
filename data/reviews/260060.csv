"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thewalruswaspaul/recommended/260060/","thewalruswaspaul","Tex Mech","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thewalruswaspaul/","356 products in account","Headrush is considered one of the "b a s t a r d children" alongside The Lost Gold in the YDKJ series. The primary audience for this game is aiming for teenagers back in the 90's, which contains some educational questions (like Vitamin A, elements and fish eggs) mixed in with pop culture references (like South Park, Buffy, Hanson) alongside with the classic YDKJ humor we've seen over the past 18 years. Many questions are too easy to awnser, so you could breeze through an entire game within 7 minutes. Bob, the host, in my opinion is a good host, but not as funny as Cookie and hell of a lot better than Schmitty from The Lost Gold. The question transitions are pretty entertaining to watch, with the animation resembling the work of John K (creator of Ren and Stimpy) and other styles like anime. This is the trivia game that represents a staple of the late 90's and it has an undeniable charm to it. Not the best in the series, but no matter what, I recommend Headrush to test your knowledge of 90's pop culture.","December 24, 2013","true","2.2"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Yes, the Jack Attack is called the Head Rush for no reason, and the screws are replaces with Chatters, but the questions are fun to answer. Get it now. You'll love it.","May 4, 2014","true","3.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The questions are much more simple than regular YDKJ games (which planet is closest to the sun? REALLY?), but you've still got a basic YDKJ game here, ♥♥♥♥ jokes and all. Play this one with people who are really bad at trivia. At least they can say "man, I knew that one!"","November 9, 2013","true","0.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Unless Jackbox games fixes this issue, I can not recommend this.  Shame too, YDKJ was one of my favourites when I was a kid.  If I could rate all of the, at once, I would probably downvote them all apart from volume 6 since it is the ONLY one to have sound for me.","November 20, 2014","false","1.3"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"
