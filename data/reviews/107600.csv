There are quite a few of them around, but my search has been to find something as close to the PSN great Super Stardust HD as possible. A truly amazing twin stick shooter that many of us even got for free after the infamous ApocalyPS3 where PSN got hacked a few years back. Our reward was free games for not being able to login for a month! I ended up with Super Stardust HD, Little Big Planet, and inFamous as mine so I did well, but Super Stardust HD was the big surprise of the lot and I have been searching for a similar twin stick shooter ever since.\n\nWaves may not be the same as Super Stardust HD, but I am very happy with the similarities and this style of twin stick shooter regardless. So my search for similar games to SSHD actually DOES result in finding some other greats now and then. In SSHD you played on a sphere where you orbited planets and destroyed asteroids and enemies with bombs and a boost. This spherical type of Twin Stick I have yet to find another one worthy of mention unfortuantely. In Waves you are inside a flattened circle,  but it does give me the close-quaters bombs and instead of a boost it gives us a "Slo-mo" feature to get out of sticky spots.\n\nWaves is easily one of, if not the best twin stick shooter on Steam imo. It has a similar graphical style of Geometry Wars where everythng is minimal, but that is perfectly fine and works well. It serves up massive combos like most shooters should have and has a great deal of different game types you can play. In fact I was very impressed by the amount of different game types avaialbe in Waves, and these have been doled out for free over the course of its life.\n\nThe main game type, however is Survival, and it means what survival means. Stay alive as long as you can and try to get the highest score possible. Unfortunately, the game has a max score limit of just over 2.1 Billion. It's not particularly easy to get here, but it is there. There are only a couple hundred Waves experts who sit a top the leaderboards with this max score so you aren't going to get to it without A LOT of practice and time played. I am not one of these experts who has achieved the score...yet.\n\nOther game types include Bombing Run, which you play with just bombs. Hold, which was just released in March, is a mode where you can only use your weapons when you are inside a designated area of the screen. So no flying all over the place to avoid things, you must get into the attack zone to keep yourself alive. Crunch time gives you quick events that you must beat from other game modes. This is just a few of the game modes and there are 6-7 total if I remember correctly. All with their own Steam Leaderboards for the community, friends, and Local. The Leaderboards actually work too unlike many of the other shooters on Steam right now. (ie. Scoregasm, although Scoregasm is a pretty fun TS shooter for a cheap price)\n\nWaves is definitely a GREAT twin stick shooter for any fan of the genre and I would highly recommend it. If you are one that wants to get massive scores and are willing to put in the practice and play time you can get there. With all the game modes available, and the time it may take to reach a score you can be proud of, you will be able to play for dozens of hours, if not 100+ hours. Waves is now a staple of my Steam gaming library for when I just want to jump in a game and start shooting things!\n\nSteam Achievements are plentiful and are broken down to each different game mode so you can only get them all by trying all the modes. They aren't particularly imposible to get, although your skill level must increase greatly as well as your undestanding of the mechnics to achieve most of them.\n\nGamepad support is fine (BTW...TWIN STICK Shooter means they are meant to be played with...TWIN STICKS, not a keyboard and mouse...lol) with the XBox 360 gamepad, although I use a PS3 Dualshock 3 Gamepad with the DS3 Tool. For me, I wanted to flip the buttons around for bombs and slow-mo so using the DS3 tool made that very easy to do without having to go into an .ini file to change it up. There aren't control bindings in the game options so you need to do it manually, or with something like the DS3 tool. DS3 Tool is faster and easier for me as it is just changing the buttons up in the 360 emulation config rather than having to update the .ini file anytime there is a patch, which could replace that .ini file.\n\nWaves 2 is now in the works as well and looks to be taking community suggestions of adding many different weapon types and other game styles. From videos I have scene it looks like it has some sort of "maze" style to some of the modes where you maneuver around walls and fight enemies this way. Oh yeah...Waves 2 also has a co-op feature it appears. It had a kickstarter a while back, but didn't get funded unfortuantely, but it's still being develped, however and you can find a lot of gampelay videos of it on Youtube. I am lookign forward to that as well. It looks different enough that Waves 2 won't actually "replace" Waves as a game I will play. :)","June 12, 2014","true","119.0"," 55 of 58 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","55","58","0","6"

Killing enemies levels you up. Upon leveling, a score multiplier is randomly placed in the arena. Collecting this increases your multiplier by 1 permanently. Killing lots and lots of enemies in a short period of time also increases your combo meter. When your meter reaches 10 you get to drop a bomb that kills enemies in the surrounding area. You can also slow down time for a brief period if this get a bit too crazy. You add all of this together and you get a fun fast shooter .\n\n+ The game has plenty of interesting modes to keep you engaged. Each mode is vastly different from the last and offers plenty of different ways to play the game.\n\n+Great music\n\n+ This game is the definition of pick up and play if you are looking to kill some time. Lots of replayability\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Some achievements are very hard to get\n\n- Can be frustrating at times\n\nConclusion\n\nConsidering I got this game for one dollar, it probably is one of the better purchases I've made. If you love the genre then this is a fantastic game to add to your library. If your just a casual fan like myself then you will also find it enjoyable.\n\n\n\n","October 28, 2014","true","7.4"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","22","25","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/qcxv/recommended/107600/","qcxv","Glypha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/qcxv/","982 products in account","A twin-stick shooter with a calm, polished, cybernetic aesthetic, Waves is a solid member of the genre with interesting mechanics but limited content.\n\nWaves is a game where you control a sphere rolling within a cylinder, shooting a spray of bullets with the aim of removing an array of shapes which you are motivated to kill because A) They give you points, and B) You blow up and stop moving when they hit you. The game has a few interesting auxilliary mechanics. First is the buffer which is a rechargable bullet-time power that is a main panic button, and the second is bombs that become available based on your combo multiplier. If your combo breaks than the bomb disappears so there is an interesting anxiety if saving a bomb, and also a chance to chain together a large number of bombs for maximum efficacy. As difficulty ramps up and the chances of missing decreases due to the large number of baddies on the screen, bombs become more and more frequent, which leads to a fun chaotic dynamic when things get tougher.\n\nThis game has a small, understated, relaxing techno themed soundtrack that goes well with the hex-gridded environment and the polygonal, computer themed enemies. It took me a while to appreciate the game's design as there is quite a bit of subtlety, but in the end I appreciated the vision.\n\nThough ultimately enjoyable there are some minor gripes. First, I can't pause between death and respawn, though often I wish to simply restart the level after an early untimely death. Also, the challenge mode often perplexingly doesn't trigger success for the challenes appropriately. Further, the UI is a bit crowded and oddly designed. For example, a high score is often displayed proiminently in the middle right of the screen, while the current score is displayed on the middle left of the screen. There is a lot of data on the screen. Aesthetically it works in a sort of augmented vision manner, but practically I would like to reduce a lot of this clutter. My worst is criticism is Ithat he amount of content is limited. Many game modes play out quite similarly and there is only the one stage. After a few hours you've seen it all, and you may not want to grind the same set up repeatedly.\n\nThough unfair due Waves' differing mechanics, I feel this game asks to be compared with installments of Geometry Wars. If you liked Geometry Wars, then you will like Waves. If you didn't, you won't. If you've never played Geometry Wars than Waves is a cheap introduction to the genre when it is on sale. The game is a solid effort, and personally, I'm excited for the sequel, which as of this writing is in Early Access.\n\nWaves are a physical phenomena resulting from specific excitation in a medium. Most waves involving the medium itself are limited by the speed of sound in that medium, while the travel of optical and electromagnetic waves depends on the speed of light in that medium. This review brought to you in part using waves from Original Curator Group.","January 24","true","3.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/107600/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","This game is essentially Geometric Battles 2. If you're looking for a quality twin-stick shooter, and you're sick of having so much free-time, then give this a look.\n\nPLOT: Roll around, shoot stuff, and don't die.\nWhile there are seven modes of play, there are some constants to be aware of. Waves emphasizes the multiplier-system. Every-time you level-up, a multiplier bonus appears on the field. Scores tend to be very top-heavy, the longer you survive, the better your score. However, by playing risky and using the limited slowmo ability, you can tack on another 4X bonus to every shape you destroy. Early on that doesn't mean much, but earning a 60X bonus by level 15 can be very nice. It also pays to keep combos going, because for every 10 shapes, you get a temporary bomb. For most modes, an extra-life is awarded every 10 levels.\n\nCrunch Time - You have three minutes to get a high-score. Since time is limited, this mode revolves around maximising the slow-down ability. This is a good mode, especially when you want to play a videogame, but only have a few minutes.\n\nSurvival - Self-explanatory. You're given a stock of lives and you have to go as long as possible. Every several seconds a wave of enemies surrounds you, which can mix things up a bit.\n\nRush - You're under a time-limit, with extra seconds only awarded through level-ups and destroying cubes. My strategy consists of moving in circles, only going for the multipliers if I bomb through the hordes. Honestly, I think I play it a little too safe, and my score tends to suffer as a result.\n\nBombing Run - No weapons and you have to keep grabbing and exploding bombs to destroy enemies and survive. Your only other means of defense is a shield. It recharges quickly when the action is hectic, but only activates once. I really enjoy this mode, because is focuses on almost entirely on proper maneuvering.\n\nChallenge - Destroy enemies as quickly as possible, get a high multiplier, achieve ratings of up to five stars. This mode consists of 20 stages. It's alright, if you're looking for something a bit more concise. The challenges have specific tactics so you're employing more thought into the game aside from: "I better not run into this shape!"\n\nChase - You have about five seconds to move from point to point while destroying shapes. I guess this mode is directed at guys like me who prefer to play the wall and take it easy. Due to the ultra-stringent time-limit, things will get extremely intense. It's easy to fall into despair, when you have only a second left, and a thick crowd of enemies have blocked off the next point.\n\nHold - You can only fire while in the lit-area. Keep in mind that this is a tight-space to be confined to. You might even have to leave the lit-area just to lure shapes out of your personal space. Those precious multiplier bonuses tend to spawn outside as well. This is a tough mode to play, simply due to how claustrophobic it is. I don't really care for it.\n\nWhile getting overwhelmed in this game is a constant, what actually kills you is usually the one shape that gets away. You're circling around, firing at a huge mass of shapes, but you're not looking at where you're moving to. Guess what happens next? An enemy spawns in your face and you die. Maybe that one shape matrix-dodges your bullets somehow. Yes the game can throw so many shapes on-screen that it'll cause your $1000 PC to freak out, but what kills you? That one shape. I shouldn't have to say this, but focus is the key. If you're distracted for 1/120000th of a second, you're done for.\n\nLike its inspiration, Waves has really good leaderboard support. If you have a lot of friends that play this game, all the better. The score of the next person ahead of you is always on display, giving you an incentive to work harder.\n\nThere's not much else to say really, you probably already own this game(via an indie bundle), but ignored it due its generic title. Definitely give this game a look, you'll likely have a lot of trouble putting it down though.","December 1, 2014","true","3.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","10","10","2","0"

My original review written back then was pretty hyped, basically chanting slogans like "I'm Hooked", "It's Uber!", "Grab it now!" (As you can tell, I was pretty impressed!).\n\nIn a retrospective (& more balanced) look, Waves boasts solid mechanics, simple design & challenging arenas/modes. Don't be fooled by the simplicity though, this game is hardcore! The small circular 'Neo-Cyberspace' arena to navigate, along with the swiftly increasing viruses, bugs (& other strange spawners)  that trigger wave after wave make this a true challenge to survive for any extended period. This difficulty can be off putting to some, but I really enjoy the intense gameplay - it keeps me coming back .. sweaty palms and all!\n\nBeing a twin-stick shooter you are obviously able to move & shoot independently on each analog stick, but in  Waves you also have a slow-mo 'Bullet Time' rechargeable power-up which gives you those split seconds needed to make an escape or clear some spawners when things just become too hectic. You can use this strategically to boost your scores too, such as getting a combo to enable your timed 'mega bomb' or get up close & double your points with the 'Point Blank' bonus. Movement & aiming are fluid & these additional tactical features become instinctive to use after a very short time playing.\n\nEnemies are distinct, visually, clearly identifiable & have complementing attack moves. They have some cool mechanics, although you will learn there patterns before long (there aren't a lot of different enemies). The sheer numbers in later waves & the combinations of enemies used negates their relative simplicity. When you experience these large number of enemies with the vast amount of effects & action happening on screen, it can be hard to keep track of your location. This is the only downside I have found overall, and is  really due to having such nice graphical effects (take the good with the bad I guess :) ).\n\nOf all the modes, the classic Survival mode remains my favourite, although there are another six unique modes also available to tackle. Some are harder than others. There is the Challenge mode offering unique puzzle like waves to clear, Crunch Time offers short burst 3min timed runs & Bombing Run where you have no guns, only bombs to  defend yourself with. Destroy the Cubes as quickly as possible in Rush, try the ‘Run'n'Gun’ Chase mode where you need to hit the spawning markers within 5 secs to continue & the newest mode call Hold where you have a small moving circle to stay within to enable your weapons which I find perhaps the toughest of them all!\n\nBelow is straight gameplay footage of Survival mode -  A taste of what Waves is like in action:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=325677941\nAll these great modes, enemy types & overall challenge add up to a lot of replayability. When you wrap that up  in some smooth controls, gorgeous visual eye candy, pumping electro musical score (that has that tendency to get stuck in your head!), add online & friends leaderboards, a swag of interesting achievements & a big picture friendly design, you really have something special. You can see a lot of time has been put in to balance out, refine & improve the gameplay by the one-man development team @ Squid In A Box.\n\nWaves has held strong against the tide of new twin-stick shooter titles over the years, remaining one of the best available on Steam. If you missed this when it came out, it’s certainly worth a look now its half the price. It's great quality & great value!\n\nJust as much fun to play now as it was when I got it!\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","November 22, 2011","true","22.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Or 30 mins. Or 2 hours, Like me.\n\nGameplay\nWaves controls extremely well, with a controller or not. You play as a ball, and your aim is pretty much to blow up everything in the arena to earn XP, to earn multipliers, to earn points. This ball that you play as has a couple of tricks up it's sleeve though, the first is the ability to slow down time, and the second is, after you reach a combo of 10, you can let off this  explosion killing everything within a small area. The scoreboard in this game is amazing, it clearly and neatly displays your friends high scores as well as your own when you end the game. It even displays  your friends high scores during the game to the right of the screen. This suprisingly doesn't interrupt gameplay at all. The game has several modes, Including: Crunch Time, Survival, Rush, Bombing Run, Challenge, Chase and Hold. Survival, which I would say is the main mode here, as it is just classic roll around and kill everything, you have 3 lives and unlimited time to post the best score and every 10 levels, you gain an extra life, in Rush, you have 2 minutes to earn points, and every time you die you lose 10 seconds from your time, Crunch Time throws you into the arena with infinite lives and 3 minutes to just have fun, and that is what you do in this mode, have fun, in Hold mode, you have 3 lives and have to to stay within a circle of light as it floats around the arena,you have to stay inside this as your guns won't work outside of it, Chase is an insane mode where you have 5 seconds to roll over to these red pads, which re-news your five seconds to live, Challenge mode gives you 20 waves of enemies, and 30 seconds to complete each one. Completeing the challenges, (doing it within an amount of time and stuff like that) will award you bonus points, finally there is Bombing Run, which  dissables your guns, and throws down these red pads, you then need to roll over them to pick up the bomb and then go to the green pad before the bomb explodes, when you get the bomb on the green pad, it explodes killing everything. Except you.\n\nPrettyness (or graphics/presentation)\nWaves has an awesome art style, everything is very crisp and works well together with the amazing neon glow of everything. Sometimes the screen can get a bit crowded, but this isn't too bad.\n\nSounds/Music\nWaves has an amazing sound track wich fits in perfectly in the background of all this caos. there is also a nice robotic lady-like voice that tells you when your bomb is ready and stuff like that.\n\nVerdict\nThis is a fantastic game for just 5 bucks considering the amount of content. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys, um, explosions, guns, balls, cool music and robot voices :).\n\nThanks for reading this!\n\nTL;DR\nHas explosions and guns.\nNuff said.","March 6, 2015","true","6.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

I really like the neon-looking style to fit with the theme of Cyberspace and errors & viruses overrunning the arena. The main objective in most modes is to last as long as you can and shoot your way through the waves of enemies, with each wave getting progressively harder. There are different coloured bugs which overrun the arena, each with a different movement pattern and there is also a virus of hexagons which grows over time filling the arena. These viruses are good for shooting to obtain a "bomb" which you can use by hitting the space bar, but if you wait too long it will wear off and you won't be able to use it.\n\nI love the "Bombing Run" mode, where you can't shoot at all but you have to roll and dodge enemies while going from red hexagons to green hexagons to set off a bomb, killing enemies near you. The dodging enemies can require some good skills but you also get a shield every so often to help protect you, the shield basically pushes enemies back if they hit you for a short amount of time acting like a instant second life.\n\nAlso - Achievements! ^_^","April 8, 2015","true","6.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Looks wise it  delivers for the most part and I like the short written verdict on your performance after each game, a nice touch.\n\nThe bomb dynamic is a refreshing and clever new twist on the GW format. I'm not totally convinced about the slow-mo ability which seems like an unavoidable fix for the inertia based player movement. Without it you simply cannot change direction quick enough to avoid some potentially impending deaths. With it I feel like I'm activating a cheat, albeit a metered one... The longer I've played it the more these two issues bug me but on the whole the gameplay is pretty good, maybe just not quite perfect for my own taste.\n\nI would have liked the leader boards to show the total number of scores/players, this is a common annoyance also found in the GW games, it is hard to measure your standing without it.\n\nIt is good and I would definitely recommend it still, but not as much as when I first played it.

Lemur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nalgasdlemur/","949 products in account","I guess for a shooter that isn't beatable, it doesn't make sense to wait until I beat it to review it, and I've played it for several hours already. This is just super great. In some ways it's just a very well done twin-stick shooter, which makes for a good game but doesn't really stand out by itself. It's polished, and all the fundamental mechanics feel and look and sound good. The things that really keep me coming back for a couple rounds every few days are the extra mechanics on top of the basic ones and the well thought out game modes (one in particular).\n\nA slow motion ability is not exactly a new or unique concept, but it's used well in this game, with a limited meter for it that drains VERY quickly and recharges moderately quickly, so it's very often available, but only in small amounts. You also get bonus points while using it, so you have to decide whether to trade off using it to save your life or be risky and use it to pad combos for more points. The other main mechanic is the bomb system. Your combo multiplier goes up as you kill more enemies without a break of more than I think three seconds in between, and at certain multiples you're awarded a bomb, which as in most games insta-kills anything in a relatively large radius around you. However, unlike most games, you cannot save it for later use. You have a few seconds to activate it, or it's gone forever. If timed/chained properly though, you can use a bomb to get you a good chunk of the way to your next bomb, then repeat. Of course, when there are enough things on the screen that you can get away with that, you need to be on your toes or you won't last long.\n\nIt has some common game modes like unlimited time with a limited number of lives, or infinite lives but a fixed amount of playtime, and some more exotic or panic-inducing ones like the one which lights up a small spot on the screen, and if you don't move to it within a few seconds you die. Once you get there, it picks a new random location. Oh, and you also have to keep playing the normal game while doing that. Good luck. The one I've really gotten stuck on is Bombing Run, which takes away your guns entirely but continues to spawn enemies. It places a bomb pad at a random location where you can pick up a bomb, at which point it creates a delivery point at a different random location. When you bring the bomb there, it detonates like a bomb in the other normal modes, and a new bomb pad is generated. If you get a high enough combo, you can get a single-use defensive shield, but mostly it's about positioning, movement, and reading patterns and paths through what becomes a huge, chaotic mess at higher levels. It's really great for practicing that stuff without being distracted by all the shooting you're normally doing in most modes of most games, and it's just plain fun.","August 21, 2013","true","13.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rexnefx/recommended/107600/","rexnefx","rex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rexnefx/","233 products in account","A hectic and vibrant twin-stick arena-based shooter that delivers.\n\nThe Good:\n- Includes several different unique game modes, which each provide their own challenges, and each are even entertaining in their own right.\n- The graphics are lively and vibrant, and add to the feeling of the overwhelming odds stacked against you.\n- The bomb mechanic is excellent.  I get chills thinking about times I cleared the arena with 3 consecutive bombs strikes just as i was getting overrun.\n- Has a good variety of distinguishable enemies, and the slowly-growing "virus" is a wonderful touch that allows you to turn an encroaching foe into an arena-clearing weapon.\n- I think the music is good. Honestly I can't remember it.\n- The game has the derisive sense of humor of an older brother.\n- It's made by a studio called Squid in a Box, which might be the best studio name ever.\n- The game menus are succinct, fast, and well-designed.\n\nThe Bad:\n- With everything going on around you and the colorful graphical effects it's easy to lose track of what's going on.\n- The leaderboards seem hacked.  Everyone in the top 10 or whatever has the exact same astronomical score.\n- Some people might be turned off by the pace of this game.\n\nOverall I recommend this game, especially if you like fast-paced arcade-style shooters where you die a lot but occasionally have those epic runs you want to tell you friends about.","October 9, 2014","true","2.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Although it comes with a handful of other modes, most of them are the same game with different objectives.  Despite lack of content, the content it does offer is solid.  Not mind-blowing, but will leave a smile on your face.\n\nIf you enjoyed Geometry Wars or enjoy topping high scores, this is the game for you.  I wouldn't pay full price unless you dearly love the genre.  I would highly recommend waiting for a sale of $1 or less and kill a few hours with it.","February 16","true","3.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

With your sphere you shoot plasma balls/beams that destroy other geometric shapes when you hit them. Those shapes spawn in intervals, depending on the level youve gotten to. You gain levels by destroying the shapes and collecting little blue orbs of EXP that conveniently home into you when you get close enough.\n\nThis is a greatly fun game in short bursts. Its simple to learn, but difficult to master.\n\nIt is also clear that this game is a fantastic way to increase your hand-eye coordination, multi-tasking potential, and accuracy of short-term logical predictions. As you gain levels it becomes exponetially more difficult to coordinate your spheres movement (cannot touch any other shapes or youll explode!), your plasma beams, and the path youll need take your sphere in the next 1 - 3 seconds to avoid the semi-predictable paths of the other shapes and avoid touching any of them, lest you explode.\n\nGraphics: For what the game is, Im satisfied with, and enjoy, the graphics. They are colorful, appealing to the eye, and mesh together well. 10/10\n\nSound: I have no complaints about the sound other than that there are not enough music tracks. I believe there are 4 total, which are nice tracks, but a little on the low side quantity wise, which can start to become repetative. 8/10\n\nGameplay: Intense, is the best way to put it. Perhaps even "overwhelming" at first once you get 8 or 10 levels into say "Crunch" mode (3 minute game, get highest score possible). But thats not a bad thing; as stated above, Waves really has awesome potential at training your hand-eye coordination, multi-tasking, and movement prediction capabilities. 10/10\n\nI got this on a whim while it was on sale, and I am very satisfied that I did. I would fully recommend this game to anyone who enjoys intense, even overwhelming levels of information that need to be dealt with immediately lest you explode. I also see this game as having the potential for being a training game for just about any other fast-paced video game out there.\n\nFinal score: 28/30 = 9.33\n\nPS: Ive seen reviews questioning if this game is OK to be played with mouse and keyboard instead of gamepad. I play with M/K, and I find no intrinsic problems using them as opposed to a gamepad. Ive used both on Waves, and prefer M/K myself, but it all comes down to personal preference. Im very adept at M/K, but not so great with gamepads that require stick usage.\n\nId recommend trying both, and seeing which feels better to you right off the bat. Whichever does will probably be your best option.","March 26, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is really amazing. Very easy to jump in and out of quickly. I found the games in geometry wars took much longer to get exciting, waves gets into the crazyness quite fast and keeps you there as long as you can stay alive. It looks great, the soundtrack is great and the feel is very responsive. High scores can be destroyed if you manage to pull off amazing stunts. Don't get me wrong, Geometry Wars was and is a true classic, not saying Waves is necessarily better..

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/digvhorszak/recommended/107600/","digvhorszak","bee movie blu ray dvd combo pack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/digvhorszak/","129 products in account","This game is only good if you can buy it for less than the price of geometry wars: retro evolved. GW:RE outclasses it in so many different ways: better bomb system, better combo system, and better enemies; but, the problems that this game has can be easily fixed with one or two balance patches, but the devs seem to want to use their time putting in community reccomendations for game modes and ♥♥♥♥ instead of fixing these.\n\nSome specific gripes:\n\nBombs are terrible. They are never usefull when you can get them, unless you can kill a bunch of virus in a small period of time, because the enemies that you killed to get the combo to get the bomb were probably all the enemies in the bomb's radius.\n\nEnemies are unbalanced. The clustery things that turn red when you shoot them are a direct upgrade from the 3 little ball things, but they sacrifice speed for survivability: this means that it takes so much more effort to kill them than it does to kill literally any other enemy other than cubes. The green ball things that dodge your bullets are absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t; you could be in a perfectly fine position, then 4 or 5 of these ♥♥♥♥ers spawn in, and suddenly you have to use all of your slowmo to kill each of them individually, and if you miss, you have to resort to killing them outside of slowmo, which poses the same problem as the clustery things- you're using more and more effort to kill something that shouldn't take that much.\n\nEnemies use too much rng to spawn. Enemies in this game spawn in seemingly completely random patterns, and take .5-1 seconds to spawn; this means that if you're being overwhelmed in a game and one or two dudes spawn right next to you, you either have to use your slowmo to move out of there, or you instantly die, and you've probably already used your slowmo to survive being overwhelmed.\n\nCubes have too much health for their size and impact on the game. The cubes in this seem good on paper, but when implemented, are absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing broke as ♥♥♥♥ in practice. They have the same problem as those other ones I put down, with taking too much effort to kill, exept these ones seriously punish you for not having the answer to them right when they come into play; they need to spawn in when you're in a position to get a bomb fast, otherwise you have this huge death-square coming for you and you can't deal with it without leaving every other enemy unattended.\n\nThe combo system is trying too hard to be original. Honestly this part could be very easily fixed if the devs understood why most games use either the 'combo is constantly going up as you kill enemies and resets when you die or something' system or the 'combo goes up pretty fast but instantly goes away in a small period of time after you don't kill something' system. The system that waves uses is trying to make the latter better, but fails miserably: you need to kill 3 enemies to get one stack, and that will only happen when you're being overwhelmed by enemies or during an ambush of like 10 dudes. It rewards you for being in situations any sane person shouldn't be putting themselves in, which results in you needing to be lucky/really really good at twin stick shooters to get high scores in survival.\n\nThe challange mode is absolutely infuriating for completionists. Not being able to go in and pick which levels you want to do and not do is just ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. Having to do that one level that you always ♥♥♥♥ up on when you're doing great in one challange run makes me want to stop playing this.\n\nTL;DR: This game is poorly designed and needs balance changes and you shouldn't buy it until the devs fix what I've complained about. 3/10 outclassed by geometry wars in almost every way.\n\nEdit: the music is pretty ehh as well, thought I should mention it; easily fixed by turning it off and turning on your own music.","February 7, 2015","false","2.4"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

Well, what's so clever about it? Light travels in waves, and there's waves in water, and you seem to be a little ball in a petri dish causing waves in the water while viruses, or whatever they are, reproduce. Oh, and there's some music, and sound travels in waves! And when you slow down time, the music slows down! Oh, how clever.\n\nThere's a twinge of sarcasm there, I know that some have a hard time being able to notice that on the internet. Anyway, the game IS a lot of fun, and it is a very fun diversion, as I stated before. For...a little while. I can't see anyone dedicating tons of time to this game because, to put it simply, it gets boring pretty quickly. It's great to have a game to pick up for a few minutes at a time if you just have a few minutes to kill, and this game is perfect for that. However, it's so similar to some other game *cough* Beat Hazard *cough* that do the concept just a little bit better. The things that make this game unique also make it rather samey in the move-around-in-a-specific-area-and-shoot-crap-dead niche, which I happily subscribe to.\n\nBig fat A+ on the gameplay\n\nB+ on the visuals, which are nice, but they could stand to be toned down juuuust a hair so that thing you need to pick up to refill your slow motion gauge isn't completely indiscernable from an enemy spawning in the same exact friggin' place (that's not challenging, just cheap.)\n\nC+ on the soundtrack - now, don't get me wrong, the songs in the game are FRIGGIN' GREAT, but there's exactly 4, maybe 5 of them. The game could stand to use a bit more variety in a soundtrack. I have a hard time believing that the combined length of the tracks included equals up to the 25 minutes they have set for one of the survival achievements.\n\nOverall, 7/10 - would definitely recommend buying, but you won't be putting hours and hours and hours of time into it. Honestly, if it let me use my own music to play with the same game modes, this would probably overtake Beat Hazard for me, of which I've put something like 40 hours into playing. Give us a little bit of customization. I'm begging for a sequel, no, really.","May 17, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's a good casual game to kill some minutes of your day, if you like shooting, running away from multiple enemies and dropping megabombs to make a rainbow of sparky explosions. It reminds me of old 2D games representing some spaceships rushing through hordes of aliens or asteroids with their Big, Terrible Guns. Also, after each game you will receive some witty remark from the devs; their sense of humour is... remarkable."\n\nThere's not been really much to add since; I'd just say that buying the game gives you rather little advantages. The other music tracks that are not available in the demo are actually quite dull; as for the other game modes, they do add some difference and new experience to the gameplay, but generally the demo version of Waves fulfills its time-killer functions exactly as nicely as the paid one.","January 7, 2013","true","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This ability recharges at a decent pace.\nYou have bombs, but they works rather differently: When you get a combo of 10 kills, you can use a bomb (you lose it if you lose your combo, though). As you can imagine, there can be a lot of enemies on screen, so getting a 10x combo is mind-numbingly easy to do again and again.\nThere is a Level & Experience system, which is used to scale-up the difficulty for a particular play-session. I find it adds absolutely nothing to the game, and there's no reason to even pay attention to it as you're playing.\nThat said, you can basically play it with your brain off by just going around in circles, and spamming bombs over and over again because of how quick/easy it is to constantly get 10x combos. And not long into a session, there'll be enough enemies to constantly net you those 10x combos that it won't even matter what direction you shoot in anymore.\n\nAt least, that was my experience playing it the other day, which was the first time in just under one year. I only played the main mode during that session (Survival mode), and on my very first try, got the achievement for attaining the highest score possible. So all Waves left me with was a main game mode that was way too easy to top-out, and a few other game-modes which I distinctly remember not liking very much.\n\nSo yeah, I feel that those looking for a Geometry Wars fix will find Waves somewhat disappointing. It's not a bad game at all, and might even be a decent distraction if you could get it really cheap, but it left me feeling really underwhelmed - both a year ago, and when I picked it up again the other day.\n\nEdit: I made a silly.","November 4, 2014","false","5.7"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","4"

A lot of things are going on at once, like dozens of explosions, things flying everywhere, bright lights.

The settings are great, you can change the keybindings to your liking and change to mouse sensitivity. The graphics are great and amazingly smooth. The aim seems perfect to me and I always like going into slomo to see my enemies explode. I find it a very pleasurable game and hate to exit it off.

Geometry Wars is a damn good game, and honestly I think Waves is a far better game.\n\nA lot of that sentiment comes from how Waves differs from Geometry Wars in terms of its more nuanced mechanics. While both are minimalist twin-stick shooters with similar art directions (though not identical, since Waves uses 3D models), Waves and Geometry Wars have fairly different ways in which they handle their score multipliers and bombs. Waves also has a bullet-time mechanic that's based on a meter you fill as you destroy enemies, and enemies you kill while slowed down net you a point bonus. You can also get point bonuses from destroying enemies at point blank, in which you have a circle around your ship that shows you the radius enemy ships have to be within in order to get the point blank bonus. Overall I just prefer the mechanics in Waves over Geometry Wars.\n\nI haven't played Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2, but from what I've read about it Waves it at least on par as they both offer a good handful of game modes that the original game does not have. Some modes in Waves are pretty much identical to ones in Retro Evolved 2 (Waves' "Crunch Time" and RE2's "Deadline" operate on the same principle of scoring as high as you can on a time limit), others are mostly similar with a few added wrinkles that slightly change how it plays ("Bombing Run" in Waves plays much like RE2's "Pacifism", but with the added quirk of having to deliver a bomb to a specific point on the map before the bomb detontates on yourself, losing a life in the process). Meanwhile the "Chase" and "Rush" modes in Waves not like any modes in Retro Evolved 2 (funnily enough, the only mode in RE2 that Waves doesn't have an equivalent for is, in fact, called "Waves").\n\nSadly, Retro Evolved 2 isn't available on PC. I don't feel too terribly sad about that, however, as Waves is a fantastic alternative. I can totally respect a developer who decides that they want to make a game that's *ahem* "heavily inspired" by an existing title, but then they aspire to make it just as good or possibly even better than the game they're ripping off.\n\nAlso, the soundtrack has a track in it that samples Kefka's iconic laugh from Final Fantasy VI. I just can't argue against something like that.","September 10, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thevileredfalcon/recommended/107600/","thevileredfalcon","Falcon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thevileredfalcon/","558 products in account","This game rips off quite a lot  from Geometry Wars, but I wouldn't say that's inherently a bad thing. Geometry Wars is a damn good game, and honestly I think Waves is a far better game.\n\nA lot of that sentiment comes from how Waves differs from Geometry Wars in terms of its more nuanced mechanics. While both are minimalist twin-stick shooters with similar art directions (though not identical, since Waves uses 3D models), Waves and Geometry Wars have fairly different ways in which they handle their score multipliers and bombs. Waves also has a bullet-time mechanic that's based on a meter you fill as you destroy enemies, and enemies you kill while slowed down net you a point bonus. You can also get point bonuses from destroying enemies at point blank, in which you have a circle around your ship that shows you the radius enemy ships have to be within in order to get the point blank bonus. Overall I just prefer the mechanics in Waves over Geometry Wars.\n\nI haven't played Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2, but from what I've read about it Waves it at least on par as they both offer a good handful of game modes that the original game does not have. Some modes in Waves are pretty much identical to ones in Retro Evolved 2 (Waves' "Crunch Time" and RE2's "Deadline" operate on the same principle of scoring as high as you can on a time limit), others are mostly similar with a few added wrinkles that slightly change how it plays ("Bombing Run" in Waves plays much like RE2's "Pacifism", but with the added quirk of having to deliver a bomb to a specific point on the map before the bomb detontates on yourself, losing a life in the process). Meanwhile the "Chase" and "Rush" modes in Waves not like any modes in Retro Evolved 2 (funnily enough, the only mode in RE2 that Waves doesn't have an equivalent for is, in fact, called "Waves").\n\nSadly, Retro Evolved 2 isn't available on PC. I don't feel too terribly sad about that, however, as Waves is a fantastic alternative. I can totally respect a developer who decides that they want to make a game that's *ahem* "heavily inspired" by an existing title, but then they aspire to make it just as good or possibly even better than the game they're ripping off.\n\nAlso, the soundtrack has a track in it that samples Kefka's iconic laugh from Final Fantasy VI. I just can't argue against something like that.","September 10, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The urge to keep beating that high score keeps the replayability of this game right up there, aside from your usual 'survival' mode there are other game modes such as challenges, bomb runs etc.\n\nAll in all, well worth the money and will be one of those games you return to time and time again...worthy of note is the chiptune soundtrack which accompanies this game is pretty sweet as well!","March 26, 2014","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The value you're getting out of this game for $0.99 is stupid. It's simple, but visually it's surprisingly attractive, and there are several game modes to suit your play style. Perhaps the most accurate way I can paint an image for you is by drawing a parallel with Super Meatboy. It's lacks any sort of story depth that Super Meatboy may have, but it has that same lightning-fast, razor's edge pace that demands every ounce of attention you can possibly wring from your brain. That exhilerating feeling of only barely being able to keep up, and the highly rewarding feeling of pulling of a sick run.\n\nMinimal, highly arcade, highly retro with cutting-edge PhysX graphics. Get this while it's on sale. Seriously. There is not another game on Steam as of this date that is a better buy for $0.99.

A simply and very well designed game Waves has you moving and shooting in all directions to destroy brightly coloured balls and shapes. There are a variety of game modes which are all fun and engaging, my personal favourite being Challenge, Survival and Bomb Run. This game is very hard in stages but it’s never frustrating, if you die it’s your fault, not hardware, making you even more determined to beat your last high score, or the scores of your friends. Not to mention the dry wit and humor in the instructions and end game screens is hilarious and well worth a few dollars. If you can get a few friends to play against even more so.\n\nThe visuals, music and gameplay are spot on and it's a great little time sink that I highly reccomend.\n\nA word of warning however, this game is MUCH easier and fun with a controler, rather than a keyboard.","February 4, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd like to bind the bomb and slomo buttons to the buttons instead of the triggers, but I can't.\nA few of the game modes feel a little unnecessary.\nShould probably have some kind of gun upgrades or something, it'd spice the game up and give it a lot more replay value, without it, this game gets old a lot faster than other similar games.\nPausing is really funky. You can't pause while you're respawning, a process that takes like 5 seconds, an annoyingly long time if you've gotten a bad start to survival mode or something and just wanna restart. And to further the frustration, the menu takes a little too long to come up, and if you're trying to pause in a hurry and aren't sure it came up, you may accidentally unpause it by hitting it again. In a fast-paced game like this, pauses NEED to be instantaneous, nothing feels worse than dying because you were trying to pause.\n\nBut, it's $5, which ain't too bad, so unless any of those things are a dealbreaker, I still recommend it. Good few hours of fun to be had here. If they add more weapons/guns/bullets or whatever, and maybe some gamemodes that aren't just bouncing around a circle, like an actual map, then it's a must have.","April 17, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Third thing will be how utterly random everything seems to be (what enemies spawn when, where, and everything in between).\n\nAdd to that how the game will berate, or downright insult you when it thinks you're not using the stupid "slowmo" that gets you killed more often than it saves you (because making things slower won't change the bad controls or how much inertia they decided the game needed) often enough, and quite frankly, I really can't recommend this exercise in frustration.\n\nI'm sure I could get better with more practice.

In Waves you'll find that the controls are very easy to pick up and that the gameplay has a nice casual feel to it. The graphics and colors in Waves give it a fun and attractive look/feel. With each level of Waves comes more challenging enemies charging at you, more bright explosions, and more intensity to the gameplay; all the while maintaining a simple core concept of flying around shooting enemies in outter space. A few other nice things about Waves are: a fun sountrack, bits of humor hidden in the game, a handful of different game modes, and loads of steam achievements. I'd highly recommend this game to fans of twin-stick shooters or to those looking for a fun game that can easily be picked up for a few minutes at a time.","April 9, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get it on sale if you can, but even at full price, it's never boring.\n\nThis game gets flak for being a bit simple and for being too hard; at the same time, no less!\n\nIt is what it is; it is a top-down shooter.   You're a ball, a trippy ball.  You shoot other things...there're lots of them, they never end.\n\nThe music is excellent, the graphics are quite polished and surreal, the game itself hums to the beat of the music; the controls are fantastic with a gamepad's analog joysticks, and there is absolutely no reason a fan of shmups (shoot 'em ups) should not love this thriller.\n\nMy favorite feature of the game so far is that in the Survival mode, the AI will form nets around you in an attempt to ambush you.  They spawn in a circle and close on you.

Its key gimmick is the ability to slow down time for a few seconds. It’ll kill an hour, but not much more.\nLength: 1 hour\nGenre: Twin Stick Shooter\nScore: 5.5/10\n\nFull Review: Waves is a twin stick shooter in the vein of Geometry Wars (the first two that is, not so much the third), from which it derives obvious influence. The core gameplay is much the same, pilot a shape with one joy stick, shoot with the other, and destroy different shapes on the map to earn points.\n\nWaves has a few differences though. Instead of having a set number of smart bombs, you earn a bomb whenever you get a combo of 10, and you only have a few seconds to use it before it goes away. You also can slow down time for a few seconds, allowing you to pick off enemies that are too close or maneuver away with greater ease. You can only do this for a few seconds at a time, and then it will need to recharge before you can use it again.\n\nThe game features a few different modes of play, none of which are anything groundbreaking. A time limited mode to see how many points you can score in 3 minutes, a survival mode to see how long you can last before you bite the bullet, and a few others.\n\nI got about an hour of play out of the game before I got bored of it. So if you’ve already played Geometry Wars and need another twin stick shooter, this’ll fill an hour. If you haven’t, you’re much better off getting Geometry Wars 3 instead.","November 15, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get it on sale if you can, but even at full price, it's never boring.\n\nThis game gets flak for being a bit simple and for being too hard; at the same time, no less!\n\nIt is what it is; it is a top-down shooter.   You're a ball, a trippy ball.  You shoot other things...there're lots of them, they never end.\n\nThe music is excellent, the graphics are quite polished and surreal, the game itself hums to the beat of the music; the controls are fantastic with a gamepad's analog joysticks, and there is absolutely no reason a fan of shmups (shoot 'em ups) should not love this thriller.\n\nMy favorite feature of the game so far is that in the Survival mode, the AI will form nets around you in an attempt to ambush you.  They spawn in a circle and close on you.   One slows down time, punches a hole in the net, and gets out of dodge.\n\n...or one dies.","January 10, 2014","true","142.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The laser is able to quickly move across enemies eliminating most in quick sucsession, however it sometimes can not penetrate the entire enemy or moves too fast across it. So you see each weapon has advantages & disadvantages. Not many top down shooters like this are that generous.

Get it on sale if you can, but even at full price, it's never boring.\n\nThis game gets flak for being a bit simple and for being too hard; at the same time, no less!\n\nIt is what it is; it is a top-down shooter.   You're a ball, a trippy ball.  You shoot other things...there're lots of them, they never end.\n\nThe music is excellent, the graphics are quite polished and surreal, the game itself hums to the beat of the music; the controls are fantastic with a gamepad's analog joysticks, and there is absolutely no reason a fan of shmups (shoot 'em ups) should not love this thriller.\n\nMy favorite feature of the game so far is that in the Survival mode, the AI will form nets around you in an attempt to ambush you.  They spawn in a circle and close on you.   One slows down time, punches a hole in the net, and gets out of dodge.\n\n...or one dies.","January 10, 2014","true","142.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
