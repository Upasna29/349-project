From the get-go, you're presented with an awesome feature that really sets this game apart from other RTS games - hero customisation. This is a great feature which definitely boosts the replayability and freedom within this game.\n\nYou'll also notice the game is created in the art style of pixel art - overused, maybe - but it looks beautiful and effective within the world of Evertown. I personally love pixel art and I think that it is an art style that the dev is very talented at. I also can't really complain about the game's interface either - it's simplistic and effective, just like the gameplay in Evertown. Right now, it's as simple as surviving in the harsh world this game has to offer, but the game's mechanics make this game a fun, interesting and effective experience - despite the current lack of content (which is 100% understandable since the game was only recently released).\n\nA quick list of some of the things I'd love to see eventually implemented within the game:\n\nMultiplayer (I'm aware that this is a highly requested feature at the moment)\nThe selection of multiple races\nMore interesting, interactable landscapes\nThe ability to zoom in and zoom out\nMore music!\nThere are a few minor bugs and glitches within the game, but what can you expect from a game in early access? Don't be deterred by the little things, but immerse yourself in the world Evertown has to offer, filled with masses of potential.\n\nI would highly recommend you purchase this game, even if you're not familiar with RTS - it may lack in a few things, but it's a wonderful start to the genre and I'm sure that this game's stage in early access will be an exciting adventure thanks to a great start to a game and committed Dev.","January 11","true","7.0"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","20","26","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/combatwars/recommended/432500/","combatwars","CombatWars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/combatwars/","2033 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'll start this by admitting that the 30 minutes that it took for me to get my town up and running was great fun. I've lost many a hunter and peasant to those pesky skeleton archers before I was able to build up my defenses so that they would never harm another hair on my slaves*ahem*...peasants ever again.\n\nBut with that said, you'll have a MAX of 30 minutes of enjoyment from this unless you restart your map over and over again to try out the different characters(not even sure if they change the gameplay from one to another), different starting skills, and different weapons(which are largely inconsequential to the gameplay later on. The one that heals your allies would most likely help you the most in early game). The entire map is bland as the enemies only spawn at night. During day time, you'll hear bird calls and see some trees but that's all. There's nothing else to do once you've gotten your town up and running with defenses. I've been surfing the web looking at random things for the last half hour of playtime and I've accumulated over 2000 excess wood and food because there's nothing to do. Of course, I could make more peasants or more hunters but for what? To increase my food and wood inflow? The survival aspects is extremely simple as it just revolves around having food and having defenses to defend against invading enemies. With automatically respawning heroes, it takes away a lot of the stress involved with sending him or her out to die. Another problem is that the RTS aspects involves one or two enemies slowly walking into your base. If you have your base laid out like mine, they'll never reach any of your peasants as a barrage of arrows from guard towers will kill them before they can reach your men. In the end, unless I literally handicap my own town to make the game interesting by removing my defenses, there's nothing to do.\n\nAnd then there's the fact that the dev has not commented or posted any updates in months. An update or two inbetween about the progress made would be much appreciated, even if it's something that we wouldn't be able to see in the near future. Just something that tells us you haven't given up on the game.\n\nAt this point, I can't really recommend the game as is. Until the next big update comes, this game doesn't have many features that makes it exciting to play. I'll come back and revise my recommendation when that time comes though, and hopefully it's for the better. Oh look, now I have 4000 of each resources. Neat...I guess.","May 8","false","2.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It crashed nearly 3 times on us in 30 minutes. While we play almost exclusively indie and early access games, this is unheard of. There also needs to be fairly extensive developement on the menu and overall playing system done, before I can totally recommend.\n\nPros:\n+Really fun to play, even in the current state\n+Price is probably too cheap\n+Graphics are quirky, and fun\n+Music and ambient sound is nice, at this point\n\nCons:\n-Too buggy as of (1/13/16)\n-Needs better UI refinement and hotkeys\n-Probably needs further complexity and depth added\n\nYeah, I mean its like three bucks. Its worth it, but I just hope developement continues quickly.","January 13","false","1.0"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","18","29","3","0"

I will list the current content, and my pros/cons, during the review I will try to be objective as possible.\n\nCurrent Content\n\n=Farm: Used to grow crops, needed for unit construction.\n=House: Used to increase population limit.\n=Fence: Decorative item (not sure if it prevents hordes from attacking).\n=Road: Increases unit speed, although units do not "auto-follow" the roads (yet).\n=Tower: Used to deal ranged damage to enemies.\n=Woodcutter Shack: Used as a secondary resource drop for wood choppers.\n=Barracks: Currently in-game, although the materials needed to create it are absent (in my experience).\n\nPros\n\n+Nostalgic 8-bit graphics, scanlines and all.\n+Good difficulty curve.\n+Ability to choose your hero class/perks.\n+Heroes respawn after falling in battle.\n+Promising game/mechanics.\n+Procedural world generation.\n+Ability to distribute XP "your way", i.e. either for Tech, or for Level Upgrades\n\nCons\n\n-Limited content (currently).\n-A.I. don't follow build orders/can't queue up build orders.\n-A.I. pathfinding needs improvement, guards appear to retreat to random areas after a conflict, rather than to their post.\n-Can only queue up to 5 units for creation at a time in the Town Center construction.\n-Menu options are very limited, don't seem to save preferences.\n-The procedural world generator can leave you with no resources, or room to build.\n\nSubjective/Personal Thoughts\n\nThe game has a solid idea, using this low resolution graphical style the options seem to be limitless. Currently the game is very in development however. I have had maps start where I simply had no room what-so-ever to build due to terrain issues. This is because you cannot build on/cross over mountains, and water tiles.\n\nThere are some trees (not sure if all) that seem to never deplete their resources (the fat oaks), I am not sure if this is intentional or not. The issue with this is that it goes against the idea of the game, that you have to outlast the waves of enemies with limited resources.\n\nOf course I would love to see more content in the way of resources, methods of transportation (boats/horses/etc), unit types, defensive structure types, a market, other A.I. towns, etc.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe idea of the game is simple, you have a settlement, a hero, and a few citizens to help start over. You must build up quickly because each night waves of enemies start attacking you. Right now, I haven't "lost" the game so-to-speak, which is a good thing for me, because I hate games that put you in a position to ultimately lose eventually. I like to have a little more control over my fate, and know that through good strategy I can win/survive.\n\nYou start the game by picking your hero, his perk, and his class. You then have a handful of skill points that you can distribute before the game starts. Once you are in the game world, you task your workers to start on supplies, and your hunters to scout the area for resources, choke points, etc.\n\nOnce nightfall hits, the hordes start moving in. I don't know how random the chances are, because I went through three nights straight without anybody bothering me, and that the same time I have been hit hard multiple nights in a row.\n\nThrough surviving the nights (by killing enemies), and building various structures, you gain experience. This experience is then either "saved" to level up your town center, or spent to instantly learn new techs. As of right now, the options are very limited, but I like having the RPG element of picking and choosing how to distribute my own XP. Sometimes it may make more sense to spend that XP on a Fortify upgrade, rather than leveling up your Town Center.\n\nThis pretty much sums up the gameplay in the games current state. There is not a lot to see or do at the moment, but for the price, it's more than appropriate. The only concern I have right now, is because of the price, how much content will the dev add in updates.\n\nNOTE:\n\nSome people are complaining of crashes. I have not experienced a single crash yet. The only bug I have found is, if I change from windowed to fullscreen via ALT+ENTER, the mouse cursor becomes out of sync with the game. I have been ALT+TABBING without any issues, and loading/exiting without any issues. The lower resolution may be an issue for some people depending on their pc setup, some graphics cards simply don't run windowed games at such low resolutions. You can see my build information in my profile.\n\ntl;dr\n\nIt's a solid purchase at $2.99 to support further development. The only concern is the low price, was this meant to be what it is in it's current state, minus the bugs? Or, will the dev build on this and keep adding content/mechanics. That's a risk that's personally up to each person to take individually. I supported the dev in hopes that he continues to build on this game, I recommend others to do so as well, but I respect everyones personal decisions.","January 19","true","1.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Map was very small and everything in this game that it can offer at this came can be accomplised in 10 mins.\n\nMajor bug which is a game breaker for me is that villagers will randomly stop farming fields leaving you micromanaging them often since you have to put each one back to work.  When you have many farm plots going this can get tedious because not only do I have to keep an eye on them I need to watch which plots are vacant due to this bug so I can put the villagers back to work.\n\nRight now once you are set up there is nothing much to do since aside from playing mini tower defense when nightfall comes and you have to defend your base from the creatures that attacks your base.    I would say wait for this game to get develop or not buy it at all due to its curretn state","January 12","false","0.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Here's my first game play on the early access launch day:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDNtTFrUaLY\n\nAt this point, this game runs well with simple old school style pixel graphics, yet it is pretty fun to play if you can get past that.\n\nThe game ended up crashing on me that ended my game just as the action got intense, so be sure you use the options in the top right of the game screen to save the game often if you buy this!  ..Just a heads up!  :-)\n\nI'd like to see improvements made to the AI of your villagers so they don't just stop working a given task requiring your micro-management and sometimes they just seem to take off in a random direction for no reason without being to to and get themselves killed, pretty frustating..but I guess it adds to the challenge lol.\n\nOverall, I can see this being a really fun little game if the developer continues working on this and fixes a few things, and keeps adding content.  I hope that he/she doesn't give up or abandon this, and if you find my video of this game or this game interesting, perhaps show your support with the small purchase cost!  I personally already see enough value in this game to warant the cost, just be sure you save often in case it crashes on you!  :-D\n\nI like it.  :-)","January 11","true","1.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

Yesterday I bought this game. I liked it very much because I like the strategy. I found quite a lot of minuses. The first negative is impossible to load a saved game, at least I have not found the download. Another minus for some reason, when I saved 1,000 trees or food, my game crashes. I'd like to see in this game, barns and warehouses to store food and there is a tree.More would like you to have added more soldiers and Lords. If you have added more gold mines, it would be all right. You could dig for gold. Add to the economy of the game. I would like to add more new homes.

Some others reviewers have stated that you can blow through the current content pretty quickly. This is true enough. Also stated before is the small map size and fairly limited upgrade/town options at the moment, That being said I beleive this is goin to be a $3 well spent. The interface is easy to use and familiar to anyone with AOE/warcraft experience and the resource gathering is a page torn right out of said games. The retro art style feels fun and the music sounds neat as well (The sound effects seem a fair bit louder than the music atm, Not sure if me or just game bug). I think as more and more content becomes available this game will grow into a fun and unique feeling game. P.S Multiplayer would be a blast helping each other defend from/fight monsters and stuff :).
