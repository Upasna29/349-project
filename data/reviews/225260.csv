"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darthkorig/recommended/225260/","darthkorig","Korig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darthkorig/","643 products in account","Brutal Legend combines two of my favourite things in life, Video Games & Metal. This is the game that introduced me to what is now my favourite video game company, Double Fine. In every Double Fine game you can feel the love Tim & the crew shove into every single game they create (did that sound weird?). Brutal Legend puts players in the shoes of Eddie Riggs (preformed by Jack Black) and sends him to a land which is every metal head’s dream. The open world is filled with creatures, buildings, allies and enemies all heavily (see what I did there) inspired by Metal artwork and music throughout the years. To travel through this open world, you get a badass car named the Druid Plow, and this is where the Metal kicks in full gear. The soundtrack is incredible and easily one of best parts of this game, I still hope Double Fine releases a licensed soundtrack that I can throw money at. There is absolutely no way to describe how great it feels to cruise through this Metal world, listening to a flawless and kickass soundtrack.  Without this game, I would’ve never been introduced to one of my now favourite bands, Manowar. The soundtrack includes Rob Zombie, Judas Priest, Scorpions, Tenacious D (of course), and many more fantastic bands. The voice cast is top notch as well, featuring many metal cameos such as Rob Halford and Lemmy but also having great actors such as Jennifer Hale and Tim Curry, you know Double Fine’s voice acting director is good when you can understand every word Lemmy and Ozzy speak. As with all Double Fine games, the dialogue can be very hilarious, the bigger the metal fan you are, the more you will laugh as this is the game is filled with references to the culture. This game received a lot of negative reviews about the gameplay, centering around the RTS aspects, which is funny since the RTS feature was the first part of the game developed. A simple way to describe the gameplay is “God Of War” style with RTS elements. The RTS factor only comes in during boss battles and multiplayer, where you control a large army fighting another while still being in third person rather than the usual RTS top down view. The RTS portions have a bit of a learning curve, but it’s not difficult or tedious, it feels great to lead an army AND fight alongside them. Overall if you are a metal head, Brutal Legend will feel like a game made especially for you. If you aren’t this is still an incredible game, an epic tale filled with adventure, comedy, great characters and decapitations. Brutal Legend is a game you must experience.","October 21, 2013","true","5.1"," 214 of 231 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","214","231","0","5"

Brütal Legend is also a mediocre and forgettable open world/hack & slash/strategy game. A prime example why Steam needs a “meh” button for the reviews.\n\nLong version:Brütal Legend is a tribute to metal. Not cash-in whiny pop metal, but real, classic, early seventies, head-banging, engine-worshipping, leather-winged heavy metal. It is a temple for bands like Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, or Motörhead– just to name a few from the in-game soundtrack.\n\nThis game is so metal that its cast has such names as Jack Black as the protagonist, Rob Halford as the first main boss, and Ozzy Osbourne as the shopkeeper. This game is so metal that the entire landscape is never-ending scenery of heavy metal album covers. This game is probably as metal as metal you can get without dipping your computer in molten steel.\n\nBrütal Legend is also incredibly mediocre. It wants to combine three genres: GTA style open world exploration/driving, hack & slash brawling, and real-time strategy. The problem is that it isn’t remotely good in any of those.\nThe brawling is dumb, although fun: you mindlessly mash two buttons and hope that the enemy runs out of health faster than you do.\nThe RTS part consists of spawning an endless stream of units until one army reaches the end of the battlefield to wreck the opponent’s production stage. To be frank, it is downright boring.\nStill, the driving takes the cake. The controls are worse than you can imagine (worse than Borderlands could ever be), and when you have to race on narrow platforms over bottomless pits… get yourself a pack of Xanax.\n\nI wouldn’t call Brütal Legend bad… the soundtrack and most of the plot about leading a metal-fuelled revolution against the demon-like oppressors can easily entertain you from start to finish, but you will always have the feeling that the game mechanics could have been a lot better.","October 13, 2015","true","26.0"," 145 of 166 people (87%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","87","145","166","22","12"

You buy it, install it and play it. Once you initiate the third process, you won’t need convincing on keeping on doing it.  The game is entertaining, detailed even where you don’t expect it, the npc’s are loveable, the open world big enough to lose yourself in it. What was a surprise that made me skeptic at first but turned out to be another enjoyable feature was the “casual” RTS, where from the protagonists third person that turns into a flying demon you command your various troops to take out towers and ultimately, the stage, by implementing your tactics. I wasn’t a fan of metal when I started playing this game, but because of it, I have all the metal songs from this game in my playlist.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=382331717\n\nYou are Eddie Riggs, the best roadie in the world, which means you are the one responsible for the stage glamour, but no one will know it. As things get out of control, you find your way into the past, into the age of metal, where people are used against their will by a tyrant which servers Doviculus, the demon responsible for the taint that corrupts all what metal stands for. Since Eddie is good at making things work and gives people purpose, a revolution is started. There will be many great characters that you’ll meet along the way, many of which are based on real life metal stars.  There is always a romantic sub plot where you might find some clichés, but they are the best kind. Since the story takes place in an open world, you can expect a lot of variation in locations and types of allies and enemies.\n\nThere are a lot of sidequests and neither are the fetch types, more like ambushing, hunting, racing, keeping the bikers away while a headbanger charms a girl, shooting from a ramped car, placing markers for the guy with no aim to shoot rockets, that sort of stuff. Once I had to clear a cave so that a family of bats could go back in, which earned me kisses and an apology from a bat for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on my head. There are solos to find, serpents to free and legends to learn. It’s the kind of open world that never fills empty.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=382331029\nIn the RTS missions, you’ll use your solos and your cunning, for doing things like melting your enemies faces and send the invisible forces to attack the stage while the shooters and the pyromans defend your stage.  The Deuce(your car) is fun to drive, but the controls may prove to be difficult at first, which makes it even more fun.  You can raise relics, which include Motorfoges, where you will  upgrade your attack, the Deuce, change outfits, enhance your weapons and buy stones to place on a mountain.\nIf you’re a fan of the RTS system in the game, you can expect a good time in the multiplayer.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=382329151\nI found many of my favorite gaming moments here. While people find some faults in this game, everyone finds the way to play this game and others don’t recognize those faults at all. The end was emotional satisfying, sneaking away, yet finding yourself surrounded by friends that simply ask you to never forget them at which point you’d likely say that you won’t, then driving into the sunset while your girlfriend watches smiling and dropping a tear.  You can free roam afterwards to see what more this game has to offer. I’m not done with it and I don’t want to, not until I hear of a sequel at least. In the end, I find Brütal Legend to do everything right.\n","January 27, 2015","true","20.6"," 148 of 172 people (86%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","86","148","172","17","0"

So when I started playing Brütal Legend, I wondered how the hell this game fell under my radar for so long. Thankfully Double Fine decided to port this game to the PC otherwise I likely would have never had the pleasure to experience this treasure.\n\nThere's so much great music to listen to while driving "The Deuce." Songs from Black Sabbath, Mötley Crüe, Testament, Megadeth, Slayer, Skid Row, and so many more artists are in the mix. The music is great enough to overlook even a bad game. But this is not a bad game. Brütal Legend is a fantastically fun game. The story is epic taking the role as a roadie to save the world from the forces of evil. The open world action/adventure gameplay works amazingly well with guitar solos and cooperative special moves.\n\nThe only thing I had a hard time with was the stage battles. They combine 3rd person hack 'n slash action with RTS elements and require some serious multitasking. I struggled to command my troops and purchase stage upgrades in real time, all while simultaneously trying to fight off hordes of enemies. I eventually got through them, although sometimes painfully. Despite being difficult, the stage battles were still fun and blended well with the metal based story and themes.\n\nOzzy Osbourne, Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, and Lita Ford are in this! Did I mention Ozzy? YES OZZY!\n\nIf you are a metal head, this game is a must. Even if you aren't, the game is a must.","July 9, 2015","true","14.0"," 102 of 109 people (94%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","94","102","109","10","3"

Possibly some hope in here that they make another too kick even more metal ♥♥♥.\n\nIn the vast lands of Brütal Legend made from the metal bones of Ormagöden the firey metal god. You are the man to change it all but take none of the credit you are the Roadie. Born in a wrong time this roadie knew he was meant (destined even) for something better, something Metal and Full of Gore. Venture through a land built of every punk teen's wet dream and true man's vision.\n\nThe Pros:\n- It's got a Metal as ♥♥♥♥ of story worth playing experiencing fight demons, slay the puss, and of course ROCK\n- A great wide landscape to venture through slaying all those who oppose you in your conquest\n- You Weild an Axe and guitar with far more powers than you and I can comprehend with plenty of other powers found along your journey\n- The land vast and all has plenty of quests to rock you some upgrades found in the motor forge\n- A great lore (in my opinion) that can be greatly expanded on and just enjoy\n- The God damn soundtrack is Bloody EPIC to put softly full of rocking tunes for you to rock out to on your journey\n- JACK BLACK!!!!!! nuf said\n- The strategy aspect is well done providing a differing touch on the game to make it a unique experience\n\nThe Cons:\n- The multiplayer is kind of just a port of the game's strategy which is nice just not that boom your looking for counting no one plays it i know of\n- the strategy aspect all though well done just feels like an unecessary element put in the game and that kind of sucks\n\nHonestly those are the only cons i can think of. I'm sure you will think of plenty if its not your cup of tea but to me this is my mona lisa, MY masterpiece. No matter how you look at it though it is a good buy, plenty of hours ahead of banging your head and your mom yelling at you that its too violent.

I was confused when i got to the part where you had to battle by recruiting units,  and gain fans to upgrade your stage. So i mostly just roamed around completing side missions and gather the collectables until I stopped  playing.\n\nA few months went by and decided to give the game another shot. I started from scratch to go back and see if this time I understood the battle mechanics a bit better. 2nd time was the charm, I had a better understanding of the battle system and started to enjoy the game a lot more. After that i was way more into the game. It made me want to complete the game and do all the achievements (Because i am lame like that)\n\nVery nice game. Good music, good story, very likeable characters. The side missions do get a bit boring because they are repetative and not really that challenging (Even on Brutal difficulty)\n\nYou'll finish the game pretty quickly if you don't bother looking for collectables or do the side missions. You aren't missing much if you just go right through the story, although the racing and animal hunting side missions have some funny dialogue.","March 16, 2014","true","47.4"," 46 of 53 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","46","53","0","0"

Yoü play metal, yoü listen to metal, yoü ARE the metal.  I don't think any other game has managed to so completely immerse the player in a concept and create süch a rich game world.  The art direction at Doüble Fine is simply amazing.\n\nThe game itself is rather üniqüe, combining an open world third-person action game with real time strategy.  Ünfortünately düring the original release, EA's advertising glossed over the RTS aspect, leading many players who were expecting a straight action game to be confüsed and disappointed.  Controlling troops from a third-person perspective may not be as flexible as a normal RTS and it does take some getting üsed to, büt it works well for what its intended for in the game.\n\nThe müsic in the game and the long list of big name voice actors really help draw yoü into the game.  Even thoügh I don't particülarly like most of the bands that are featüred in the game, the müsic fits so well that I can enjoy it anyway.  Brütal Legend even has the most perfectly placed song I've ever heard in a game düring one of the cütscenes, thoügh I can't stand listening to it oütside the game.\n\nOne problem some people may have is that Jack Black plays the main character.

Ünless yoü cringe at the soünd of Jack Black's voice, I think yoü'll be able to enjoy the game jüst fine.\n\nMy only disappointments are that the story felt like it ended rather süddenly when I thoüght it was only halfway throügh, the side missions get rather repetitive, and Doüble Fine doesn't have the fünds to make a seqüel.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/225260/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Brutal Legend is a mash up of a couple different genres, Action Adventure Open World RTS...yes, that many...\n\nI'll start out with the graphics, it is a nice art style however the graphics really show the three years difference, even on higher resolutions the game doesn't look as crisp as others. There is hardly any customization in the options menu to try get a bit more beef out the graphics which is almost a must for PC ports.\n\nThe actual game play is nicely done though, as I said to begin with, there are four different genres mashed up here, Action Adventure is done very well, the hack and slash mechanics are basic, but the addition of guitar solos brings a whole new way of playing, allowing you to buff up your characters or deal damage to your foes.  The open world aspect is also done very well, the world seems huge, there are plenty of side quests to keep you busy throughout the story, however these aren't crucial for story or game progress elements, and they are purely there as additional things to do.  Finally, the RTS element, throughout the course of the game, you will take part in a number of grand scale battles, in which you have to manage your resources (fans in this case) and build an army in which you command using basic squad game controls, so follow, defend and attack. To me this seemed like the worst of the four though, it seemed a little clunky and out of place, I would much rather have played it without the strategy side.\n\nThe sound track and music in Brutal Legend is obviously going to be amazing. The game features 107 metal tracks from 75 different bands, ranging from Motörhead, Ozzy Osbourne, Kiss to Tenacious D as well as many more.  The main character is also voiced and based on Jack Black which also adds the comical side of things in too.\n\nThere isn't much difficulty in playing Brutal Legends, as long as you get to grips with the basics of the RTS elements, you won't find yourself having too many issues. The hack and slash parts are too easy at times, so the only challenge comes from the RTS, which is a shame, because I would of liked to have got a little more stuck into the combat and maybe the addition of extra combos.\n\nThe game length is very respectable, I normally try to complete as many of the side missions I can in these types of games, so it took me almost thirty five hours to complete it fully, so it is a pretty chunky game, time wise.\n\nI had a few minor technical issues, even though the game was running at a smooth 60 fps most of the time, it almost felt as if I was still playing at 30, not sure whether that was an issue with my rig or not though, I turned on v-sync and that seemed to make a little better, but not by much. I also wanted to play in windowed mode for a while because I had the wiki page open on my second screen, and this gave me numerous issues with the cursor in game, I would all of a sudden just get my desktop background because my mouse had wandered off screen into my task bar, or I would start to get hover-over tooltips for other shortcuts on my windows task bar randomly, all small issues that could of quite easily of been fixed.\n\nMy final recommendation for Brutal Legend is definitely give it a try, it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I did have a lot of fun playing it, I mean, I did plunge thirty five hours of my life playing it...there is plenty of content and even just the sound track is worth some of your time, you can get the game at regular price for £10,99, but expect this to drop to as low as £2 in sales, and then you have yourself a real bargain.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/recommended/225260/","midnightwolfie","MidnightWolfie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/","597 products in account","A bit about the game and developers.\n\nBrütal Legend is an action game developed by Double Fine studios. They are the same studio that made The Cave (amazing game!), Iron Brigade, Stacking, Costume Quest, Psychonauts and couple of more others. I should mention that Brütal Legend also has couple of very good rock artists. Jack Black and Ozzy Osbourn. Honestly, I love to listen to rock-metal, but I ain't fan of Ozzy's music, and I've heard a lot of better artists than Jack, but Jack is definitely one of my favorite actors. I mean, that guy is funny! And he's an amazing voice actor in this game!\n\nAbout Gameplay.\nBrütal Legend is an action game in which all you do is hit, slash, run over and burn your enemies. Now, a lot of people find this type of game very amusing, but to me that's just too simple. Luckily, this game comes with another approach, that suits me a bit better! A strategy one! You are able to take the game into a semi-top down view, build your units and send them to where ever you'd like them to go. But I'll talk more about that later!\n\nSo, in Brütal Legend you play as a roadie (sorry if I misspelled it!) who died on a stage. The roadie, Eddie, gets brought back to life by the power of Ormagöden. But he got back into a Heavy Metal world, not the normal one. In that world, your job is to fight demons, and goths, using nothing but the power of true rock!\n\nWhen it comes to fighting, controls are quite easy to master. Managing an army is a bit harder, but still quite easy to remember and use in combat. And remember, 10 is always better than 1. So use those units wisely! In the game there are various relics that you can find. Some give you special powers, and others lets you resurrect a "metal shop". Inside of it you find Guardian of Metal (Ozzy!), who can then upgrade your car, change your character's look, give you different weapons and so on and on. The only sad thing about the game is that Eddie can't jump. He can do a lot of things, but jumping ain't one of them.\n\nThe story of this game is very good, and very fun to follow. Jack's humor is a huge extra to the game! There's also a lot of swearing and bad language in the game which aren't really appropriate for children. But you can always just disable that and turn on that "BEEEEEEP" sound if someone swears, and that will definitely make the game A LOT more funny!\n\nNow, let's head over to the multiplayer view of this game. I haven't tried out the online multiplayer, because I was sure I'd get my ♥♥♥ kicked instantly. So I did a test run with AI's, and it's AMAZING! You can chose one of three factions (demons, goths or metal heads) and fight the others. This is a full strategy game, where you spawn units, send them to battle and so on and on. Now, earlier i said "semi top down". I said that because you can only see where your character currently is. So if you want to see more of the "map", you have to fly (yes, FLY!) to the different location. I really had a lot of fun playing against the AI!\n\nGraphic and Audio\nGraphically speaking, the game looks pretty good. It looks like a cartoon, with the characters so realistic, that you are instantly able to recognize them. Songs are also pretty good, there's a lot of metal and rock. Though, you have to unlock them, so first 3-5 hours of gameplay are quite repeatable, and annoying..\n\nPros, cons and final grade.\nPros:\n- Metal oriented game!\n- Lots of famous people are inside of it.\n- Very funny!\n- Nice customization.\n\nCons:\n- On beginning the music is repeatable.\n- Map works quite weird with mouse.\n\nFinal grade: 7/10\n\nExtra info:  The game is very fun and enjoyable, but songs should have been much easier to acquire. I really recommend this game to anyone who enjoys easy games where you do nothing else except just kill creatures with two different buttons (like Darksiders, but this is better!)\n\n\nThank you for reading my reviews!

I felt captivated by the story from start to finish, more than I enjoyed the game and its pretty rare for me to say such a thing. As a game, the combat was just there, other games do it better, but nothing does the unique atmosphere better than Brutal Legend.\n\nThe story is simple, you're a downtrodden roadie working for an ungrateful emo band that costs you your life. From there, you're transported to a fantastic land made of metal and stone. Where mammoths have chrome tusks and spiders made of steel. Its a fresh take on any fantasy world. Nighttime turns into a gorgeous meteorological phenomenon, either with electric blue moons or asteroid showers. The land is getting oppressed by a demon lord and you need to band together, gather troops and lead an uprising to defeat him!\n\nThe characters are straight out of the late 70s early 80s heavy metal scene. Everyone is wearing spikes and black. Men have big muscles, washboard abs, long flowing hair and the ladies are always petite with enough mascara to blot out the sun. All the characters have big eyes and I think that helps them convey emotion much better. Its a wonderfully acted game, from the voice acting to the animations.\n\nThere's a lot of humor, charm and goofiness that I enjoyed. I'm not one that likes comedy in games, but it hit the mark for me. Its not all comedy, the game takes itself serious when it has to be. The cameos also helped. Seeing Lemmy from Motorhead as my healer throughout the game. Having Ozzy Osbourne upgrade my car's weapons was a lot of fun. Tim Curry as the supreme villain. With all the famous voices incredible performances, there were plenty of great lesser known talent doing a fantastic job voice acting. All the characters no matter how big or small all have personality and charm, even if none of them have last names.\n\nHalfway through the game, the emo starts to bleed into this world of metal and the new characters are all gothed up. Crazy haired "kids" with striped shirts, Victorian dressed women in white dresses carrying umbrellas. While they feel more Tim Burton than heavy metal, they're still beautiful as villains. What 80s metal head doesn't want to axe crimson clad, metal teethed nurses?\n\nFor a hack n' slash, its pretty simple, you've got an axe to melee, and another axe for magic. You can use the latter to perform guitar solos that you'll unlock different songs at shrines. These solos go in a mini game that's like a quick, horizontal Guitar Hero. Since you're leading an uprising, you'll be commanding troops and its easy enough. One button to have them follow you, another to stay, another to attack a highlighted object and one to attack what's in front of you. I think this adds a sort of uniqueness to the game. You'll rarely be fighting alone, you've always got a crew with you.\n\nOne of the first things you do is liberate headbanger grunts with giant necks. Then get ranged laser weapons for the razer girls from "General Lionwhyte's pleasure tower." The names alone play up what the game is going for. That era when fantasies were cool, imaginative, 80s, death, skulls and weren't dominated by elves or magic. In this world, the guitar is magic. Your solos can melt faces, heal your companions and summon vehicles.\n\nThere are double team maneuvers with allies that can keep things interesting. You're forced to ride giant speakers, getting carried by roadies to keep away flocks of seagulls. Ride on the back of a Lemmy's motorcycle to stun enemies. Headbang with your grunts. Another mission has you trying to circle a Kiss beast in a ring of fire. While I can't say it was fun, it still switched up the game play.\n\nEddie can't jump or even run, you'll need to hop into your classic, customizable hotrod named Deuce. There are mandatory driving segments here and there throughout the game to keep the game play diverse, but when you're outside of a mission, you don't have to use it, but its far better than walking. I just wish the driving was better. The steering in particular. Its not a bad in earlier parts in the game or when you're in the big open world, but later on, some of the mandatory segments are just painful to play. You're in a car, essentially off roading with trees everywhere, the slightest turn can send you off course into a tree. Some of the segments are pretty narrow and start to drag the game down.\n\nNothing drags the game down more than when Eddie Riggs sprouts wings and it becomes what most people call a real time strategy, but I call it a MOBA. Its a struggle, you as their champion sprout wings and command your army against an opponent commanding theirs. This is a lot different than just hacking n' slashing with troops at your side. You can fly and even still drop down to the ground to fight or perform guitar solos to buff your troops. You need to buy the troops with fans. Both champions have a stage or a gateway as their home base and you buy troops with fans. You get fans by performing a metal solo atop of a fan stream where a tower of a merchandise booth is then built over top of it. Its okay once you get the hang of it. I feel like this was a tacked on multiplayer facet of the game. I can't imagine some 80s metal head getting through these segments, but there's always an easy difficulty.\n\nThe more booths you have, the more funds get generated to buy troops. In this particular arena, there are six fan streams. Two by each stage, and one in each of two equal paths. So the arena is in a circle and that's fine too. Now these troops have specific talents, like a rock, paper, scissors sort of thing. Roadies take out buildings like merchandise booths and stages. Bouncers take out mounted enemies like those on horses and steel horses. Its easy to understand with the descriptions.\n\nI'd say these MOBA / RTS are 5% of the game and they're just there for diversity. Plus you can't lead an uprising without having your army fight another can you? With that said, I grew to hate these painful battles. I'm no fan of MOBAs, but these just felt like a chore of a tug of war. I'd take a tower over there, but lose a tower. These battles took far too long. Death in the MOBAs merely respawns you. Outside of the battles, death sends you back to the previous checkpoint, which might have been a while ago.\n\nA lot of love went into making this game. Well love and money. It feels like no expense spared getting the big names, making an incredible, immersive world with fantastic art design. There are little details that really make it an unforgettable experience. Even Jack Black performing a live action introduction of him finding the menu in a record jacket.\n\nThere are details in game like the wildlife. Porcupines, giant horned elk stampeding down a mountain and the ability to run them all down with your car. If not use your car's flame thrower to incinerate them. Hey this is an open world game that lets you be in control. You'll find plenty of side missions, but I didn't tackle any of them until after the main story was over and done with.\n\nWhile its not a home run for its game play or in game fun, but its so good because of its art style, story and portrayal of these characters that the incredible soundtrack is almost an afterthought for me. Its there on missions with you, and in a cassette deck of the Deuce, but I was paying attention to the character's delivery that I found myself tuning out the heavy metal. I never thought I'd pay attention to Jack Black.","March 23, 2015","true","11.5"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","37","47","2","2"

It has JB( Jack black, Leader of the band Tenacious D with Kyle, actor in films like King Kong 2005 , The Pick of Destiny and voice actor of Kung Fu Panda, as Po) as Eddie Riggs, Kyle Gas( partner of Jack black) as the Cannoner and the random bat dad guy, Ozzy Osbrown( or something) as the keeper of secrets, Lemmy Kilmister as Kill Master, etc...\n\n-GAMEPLAY: Good hack-n-slash game with an axe to hack and a guitar to shoot electricity because that rocks! You may summon your car (druidplower) and ♥♥♥♥ your enemies. The main missions are good, but a good propotion of them is to escort the Tour bus with your car and the battle Stages, that i will talk later. The side missions are also good, but some repetitive. There are the Ambush, Race, Hunting record and Cannon defence + the unique ones, but of there are only one each.\n\n-COLLECTIBLES: Yes, there are dragons to free, with the gods of metal reward you with tribute and for every 10 dragons a upgrade (Health, regen, etc), Legends, to look the past and how was everything created, artwork, the Metal Songs, that add more songs to your soundtrack. and fairies, that give you tribute if you catch them.\n\n-METAL FORGE: It is were you go and purchase upgrades for your car, axe and guitar + paintjobs(for the druidplower or your jacket), purchase cool moves and get some statues + Ozzy is in there...yes...\n\n-STORY: The story is amazing, simple, but amazing, with a very good twist at the end( after the secondlast battle), tho it leaves you wanting a Brütal Legend 2( tho i doubt there will be).It is a 10-15 hour game, at least for me.\n\nDLC( included in the game and only in the PC version): Adds some skins for Eddie Riggs, your car, axe, guitar, and statues+ 1 new weapon and a new ram for your car+ an eye that points you in the direction of a collectible, helps a lot.\n\nCONS:\n-GAMEPLAY: There's another part of the gameplay, it is the RTS one. In the Stages( battles) you can create units by getting fans from merchandise booths in fan gysers, and basicly your objective is to destroy the enemy Stage. It feels like it is out of place fot this type of game, but it is fun non-the less, gets repititive tho.\n\n-MULTIPLAYER is dead, tho there are those 2 random persons from the forum who decided to do some achivements, the multiplayer is dead, tho it doesn't suprise me, as it is only the RTS part of the game, and as i said, it is out of place for this type of game and has a rly poor ranking that it also feels out of place. Only good thing is that it let's you try the other 2 factions (Tainted coil, my favourite, and the other one).\n\n-BUGS: Yes, there are bugs, not a lot of them, but some, some haves you stuck between invisible walls.\n\n-DIFFICULTY: It is easy even on Brütal( Tho the final Stage battle took me 3 tries, and with them i found the trick to beat it). Ofc you will need to get upgrades for your axe, guitar( tho for the final hours of gameplay you should have it upgraded to the max upgrade) and the Dragons for health upgrades and whatnot( if you don't get those ofc it will be hard).\n\n\nConclusion: Heavy metal will never die, 9/10.","October 30, 2014","true","33.9"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","32","43","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/recommended/225260/","ashdot","Callietrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/","1456 products in account","An underrated game when it released on consoles back then - it stars Eddie Rigs (played by Jack Black) , a roadie feeling out of place in the future where modern rock has overtaken classic, after an accident on set, Eddie Rigs is then sent back into the "Rock Ages" as a savior of Mankind.\n\nThe game starts you out in a Cathedral, after Eddie awakens - a robed creature starts chasing you around until you pick up the legendary axe (the weapon you will be using throughout the entire game as your melee/close range) and the game introduces you to what are basic Brawler/Beat-em-Up style controls and also introduces you to your now beefed up Super-Guitar (which servers as your primary projectile weapon). You meet another of the main characters that go by the name of Ophelia, and from there on your fight your way down what appears to be a tower made of skulls until you're able to build a vehicle and escape from that area.\n\nVisually, the game looks okay, it has an unique art style to it that I enjoyed seeing and it has really cool looking sights all around the overworld, but ultimately it's a bit repetitive. Some areas just look a little bit too "samey" for me, this is somewhat alleviated thanks to the fact that these areas are pretty much modeled after their Area Boss' style of Rock - for example, Lyonwhite (the first major boss) has a more "glam" type rock, while the later boss, and major antagonist, Doviculous has a more "satanic" design that's modeled after him, which I appreciate. The game also has a pretty colorful cast that's also pretty fun to see as you met them along. The story itself though, is fairly cliche'd, but in a good way I believe, a lot of the things that occur in the game you can pretty much see coming miles away, which is what disappointed me the most about it.\n\nThe world is pretty expansive, as far as open world games are and there's a multitude of things to do outside the game's story. You can go around destroying Stone Idols (around 100+) that serve as the main collectibles, there are songs around that give you additional buffs after you play them (your guitar can play these songs in a style very similar to that of Zelda OoT's Ocarina) and finding these Garage Doors that serve as your upgrades store (where you meet "The Rock God" Ozzy Osbourne there no doubt.). On that store, you can purchase things like upgrades for your moveset, upgrades for your vehicle, skins for your weapons and a bunch more stuff.\n\nOutside of the overworld and the basic combat, the game also features a more RTS-like gameplay element to it. On certain major conflicts in the story, the game shifts to an RTS style of game that often serves as the conclusions to the 3 major bosses in the game aswell as the main Multiplayer component to the game - the only difference being that you yourself can drop down in your vehicle or from flight (yes your character gains wings during these events too!) and help out your troops. Sadly though, I felt this was the game's weakest parts personally, mostly because just rushing down your opponents are often the best way to break through the enemy defenses and constantly down their troops close to where they spawn and you yourself taking care of the few that make it through. You spawn more troops as you "appeal" to fans (or fan geysers) and gain more points, similar to resources in other RTS games, and are able to build and fix, or summon higher classes of troops to do a variety of things - like healers, heavy hitters, grunts, etc - so the RTS elements here are very bare bones.\n\nUltimately, this felt more like an afterthought to add padding to an already short game. As it stands, this is still one of my favourite games this generation for a good number of reasons, mainly for the music and Jack Black's stellar performance, even though the gameplay is very basic brawler, with added RTS elements to add padding to an already short game.\n\nSolid B+\n\n\n","November 26, 2013","true","10.2"," 43 of 63 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","43","63","0","0"

Fun + Metal in one wrapper that doesn't take itself seriously.\nThis is both good and bad. Bad in that it wants to combine open world exploration, hack & slash, RPG, driving, and some odd strategy layer. The problem is that it isn’t GOOD at anything. This game isn't innovative or original in terms of game mechanics, and the controls vary between clunky and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ depending on what you are doing. On the flip side, the game doesn't try to do anything but be fun and humorous. The plot is funny as hell and the character models, script, even the landscape refuse to even try being serious. Which becomes awkward because combat can become painfully difficult at odd times.\n\nAs for being metal, this game will ring so true to that concept it becomes impossible to conceive of something that could do a better job. The music, the customization options, character models, landscape, everything hearkens back to the era of real heavy metal. I mean, hell "King LionWhyte" has so much "big hair" that it would have made Dee Snider jealous in the 80s and he uses it to fly! lol :)\n\nHonestly I'd say this game was built on "Sex, drugs, and rock n roll" since the landscape, and surprisingly deep in game mythology, were obviously made by people on some good drugs and rock n roll is the heart of this game. But the sex part hasn't shown its head yet sadly :/ lol. The easiest thing that could have been done to make this game MORE fun was to offer an in game "god" mode so you can just relax and enjoy the hilarity. I'm a notoriously cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when it comes to buying games and this title was a gift. But just 4.5 hours in, I would totally shell out the full asking price of $15. Catch it on sale? Definitely worth it.\n\ntl : dr\nFunny and fun but mediocre game mechanics... get a trainer with god mode and love the lolz and music","December 31, 2015","true","9.9"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/225260/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nBrütal Legend is an action, hack and slash game that pulls to the hard rock or metal stereotype subculture. I personally enjoyed one play through for the game.\nImagine a world that heavy metal music describes… Skulls, demons, fire, explosions, and hot girls… Brutal legend projects those images into a video game (and quite accurately I might add). Unfortunately that doesn’t necessarily mean the combat in the game was transferred so well, I felt like I was grinding a lot to get through the game. There wasn’t a very fluid sense of progression in the game, and at times I was just trying to count down how many more enemies I’d need to decapitate before the game would be complete.\nI don’t recommend this game for anyone except people that really like metal music and metal themes (So that you may be revitalized from the combat by listening to excellent music!). As a note about the humor; the humor in the game is quite good which should be expected since Jack Black is voicing the main character and Ozzy Osbourne’s mumbling just got me to smile every time.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  You play as the main character “Eddie”, a roadie. I don’t want to get into too much detail because the story was my favorite part of this game, and giving away any of it would take away from your enjoyment if you actually get the game. I’ll just say that the story was pretty good, it didn’t always make logical sense (*cough cough* Legends that I found *cough cough* ), but in the end it was presented very well.\n\nGame Play: This is where the game takes the biggest hit, the combat gets old really fast you have a choice between using electric lightning and death, or beating people to death with an axe. Regardless of the fighting style or the weapon you prefer, you will hack your way through (literally) the hoards of hell.\nIt would be nice if they dropped orb, experience points, gold/money, or gave some sort of gain. Ultimately you will get nothing for murdering them. Why murder them? Because if you don’t; they’ll murder you, or your friends and you’ll fail the quest.\nAdditionally the game switches to a “command and conquer” style at various points, and that’s actually where I found myself enjoying the game. Maybe it’s because they let me have wings… I am a sucker for wings… Anyway, you direct your troops and destroy your enemy’s stage. That does get old but it’s more of a strategy game at that point; and I like strategy games.\n\nMulti-player:  The online Multiplayer community is kind of dead; not that I can blame it. All you can do for multiplayer is the battles, so directing your troops against someone else’s. I need some of the achievements for multiplayer that I can’t get against the AI on offline mode, so I posted on the forums and hopefully will get a majority of them completed… but I’m not holding my breath; the achievements don’t strike me as very… swift.\n\nAchievements: Simple break down for achievements: 1) Achievements for beating the game 2) Achievements for doing all the things in the open world 3) Achievements you get for doing Battles and playing against other human players 4) Achievements you get for beating the game again [on harder difficulties and getting things you didn’t notice or need to restart to do]\nMy response to these achievements is mostly apathetic; I wasn’t impressed and was just looking forward to finishing as much as possible so I could play something that I enjoyed.\n\nPrice: The price for Brütal Legend is $14.99, I plugged 27 hours into the game, with an intent to play through a few more times (so I expect the game to make it to about 35-40 hours), that’s a fair price for the time, however I didn’t find myself enjoying the game, unless you know you like games like this you should probably put your money into a game that will give better satisfaction.\nActually I would prefer to buy the soundtrack as a standalone instead of the game itself. Currently (summer 2014 steam sale) the game is on sale, if you’re really itching for a new game and you think you might like this one, go for it that’s a fair price in my book.\n\nConclusion:Pro’s: I enjoyed the story, the music is great, I understood the subculture humor and references, Jack Black, Ozzy Osbourne.\nCon’s: The combat is grindy and boring, I really hate driving cars (this game forced me learn how to do use it effectively though…), low sense of progression.\nIt’s annoying that I need to either recommend or not recommend the game because to by honest my opinion falls right in-between both of them. I’m not recommending though just because the game was so grindy.\nOnce again though, if you meet the following description you should overrule my opinion and try it out yourself: A) You like Metal Music, B) You like hack and Slash Games, C) You don’t care about achievements, D) You’re not a perfectionist for world completion, E) You want a game to play for about 10-20 hours.","June 24, 2014","false","31.8"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","0"

The design of the characters, vehicles, weapons and the surround world all fit perfectly together. Great effects throughout.\n\nSoundtrack:  In my opinion, it's the best video game soundtrack ever. Over 100 different songs from 75 bands (according to Wikipedia) in all different subgenres of metal. It's just fantastic.\n\nControls: I played the game using an Xbox controller and found the controls very easy and intuitive. Whether it's fighting or commanding troops, the control scheme is easy and doesn't require a lot of unnecessary movement. The only issue I had was sometimes during battle I couldn't pull up my song list unless I hit the RT button multiple times in a row.\n\nGameplay: The game was not quite what I expected. I thought this was going to be an action-adventure game where you solely control Eddie and fight with him. That's partly true. I did not realize the RTS-like elements of controlling and directing your crew throughout the game. It works well and is quite enjoyable, I just didn't realize it was part of the game. I will say that at times the combat feels repetitive and the RTS parts of the game all feel identical for the most part, but never to the point that it becomes unenjoyable.\n\nStory: The voice acting in this game is incredible. All of the actors do a fantastic job, especially Jack Black. The story is fun and has a few twists and turns that keep you guessing. I really enjoyed all of the different characters introduced throughout the game, especially the metal legends.\n\nI would say this is an absolute must play game if you're a fan of metal, but even if you're not I would still highly recommend it. It's another fantastic example of what makes Double Fine such a great studio.","April 20","true","6.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","2"

The coolness overcomes the flaws mostly. 4.2/5\n\n-----\n\nJack Black.  Ozzy Osbourne.  Lemmy.  Rob Halford.  If those names mean anything to you, then you know why you have to play this game.  You'll know what you're in for when you see the opening scene.\n\nBrutal Legend is a Heavy Metal fantasy game made by Tim Schafer, creator of classics like Full Throttle and Psychonauts.\n\nThe game takes place in a fantasy world inspired by metal albums, with many references to metal bands and of course, one of the best soundtracks ever put in a game.  The music alone is like a primer on heavy metal.\n\nThe story follows a roadie named Eddie Riggs, who is frustrated by the state of modern music.  The band he's touring with sucks and sounds more like a boy band than rockers.  When their stupid antics result in an accident that kills the roadie, he wakes up in a horrific-but-awesome other world, a world where rock and roll has actual power.\n\nThere is an interesting plot with some fascinating characters along the way.  The game is worth it for the performances.  Jack Black plays Eddie, while his Tenacious D partner Kyle Gass has a small role.  Ozzy, Lita Ford, and Lemmy have important roles, as well, but the biggest performances are provided by Judas Priest's Rob Halford and Tim Curry.  Veteran gaming actress Jennifer Hale also does a great role here.\n\nThe world never becomes fully realistic due to its fantastical nature, but it never stops being awesome.  This is a game where you can go to a Stonehenge made out of swords, play a guitar riff to summon a Deuce, then drive over to a clone of Mt Rushmore with Ozzy's head while listening to awesome music.\n\nThe gameplay itself has some issue, and part of the issue is that the game merges several genres, and not all that well.  The camera is unreliable, for one thing.  But the biggest issue is that the game starts out as an action game, then turns into a odd perspective on an RTS.\n\nThat's right, the game is a real-time strategy except instead of being top down, it's viewed from behind a character.  The game also borrows a bit from Guitar Hero and to a smaller extent, RPGs.  At times, it plays like a GTA-style game.  It is a fusion of many different gaming styles, but they don't really fit together.  The RTS system is especially frustrating.\n\nIt really is a case of a game's world and immersion compensating for flawed design.  But the greatness of the game in the end makes up for the problems, and it's a great game to play through.","August 10, 2014","true","22.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","5"

The game begins as a sub-par-to-decent third person brawler (with a guitar as a ranged weapon, brilliant!). But somewhere along the line, it becomes some kind of a racing sim. Huh, ok. And then it settles on being a kind of RTS, and a terrible one at that. You need to physically move your character near the units you need to move and there's no visual cue whatsoever to tell you what units, exactly, will be affected by your commands, meaning you end up selecting either too few, or too many.\n\nThat game had a LOT of potential but it's the designer team had too many cool ideas and ended up implementing none of them properly.","December 23, 2013","false","9.0"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","18","26","2","0"

Lotsa Licensed Music which are really good plus Eddie Riggs Voiced by Jack black and he was pretty damn good at it, Remy Kilmister, Ozzy Osbourne and Lita Ford were awesome although Lita Ford's character did not offer much but overall was pretty good.\n\nThe Intro for this game was so Hype! They Introduced Eddie Riggs and his Job as a Roadie and the really Bad music at this time of age wanting to go back to the past, then one of the band members does a dumb stunt and Eddie Riggs had to save him but perished. His blood reached his belt and summoned a metal demon which brought him to another world then with the Help of "Children of the Grave" by Black Sabbath's Intro the Hype of the game was at maximum level and what showed afterwards was not a let down as well.\n\nThe Gameplay was pretty suprising really, it was like an RTS Action game but it was really damn fun and the Enemies were not so easy it would be a breeze, the whole game was balanced out making sure you're not so overpowered it's easy so the game offered some challenge as well or at least that's what I got from the maximum Difficulty.\n\nThe Story was pretty interesting, making a revoloution to go against the emperor of demons and taking them down after Eddie Riggs was shown. The Story was interesting enough to keep playing and the Characters even though they were fictional they were very believable because they felt like they are similiar personalities from normal metalheads which easily made you understand them even the headbangers were believable despite their look xD\n\nStory 7/10\nSound 10/10\nGameplay 8/10\nOverall 8/10\n\nAn Awesome game to sit your ♥♥♥ if you're a Metal fan, this game made me want a sequel but sadly the 2nd game was cancelled, oh well.

The visuals are beautiful, the music kicks ♥♥♥, and the gameplay is a genre-blending fusion that feels like it was designed top-down to answer the question "What if the the hero was a roadie?"\n\nDespite being really cool in concept, though, I found the actual gameplay to be lackluster. Exploring the open world is fun, but the combat is button-mashy and the stage battles are just confusing. It's the kind of game that's fun to watch someone else play, but when you play it for yourself, it's like, meh.\n\nUltimately, I'd give it a 6/10. It's a kick-♥♥♥ original concept with beautiful visuals but otherwise mediocre execution.

The story is awesome, the jokes are right on spot. Apart from the regular "hack'n'slash" in a quasi-open-world scenario, you'll find yourself busy with guitar-hero-like mechanics, racing, side quests and some other minigames (which unfortunately get old after a short while).\n\nThe main point of the game seem to be the Stage Battles, which acts like some sort of RTS: you train units (metäääääl), give them orders, send them to destroy the enemy's stage, and of course, you lead the charge. Or you sit there playing your guitar, buffing your units. There are just so many funny things to do in a single Stage Battle, you can hardly get bored, seriously.\n\nThe achievements are fun and relatively easy (except the Cönquerer).

This game will make you one. Brütal Legend is an open world action adventure strategy game with melee combat and RPG elements all rolled into one. You play Eddie Riggs, a roadie transported into a metal world divided by war. When I say metal world, I mean metal world. Everything from creature and character design to the smallest of details is in some way inspired by heavy metal music. The best part about it is that you don't have to be a fan of the genre to appreciate the world and just have a good time mowing down everything you can with the Druid Plow, while listening to over 100 licensed metal tunes, of course.\n\nCombat is centered around two weapons; an axe for melee and guitar for ranged combat. Both can be upgraded with cosmetic and weapon effect changes. Vehicular combat is also present with multiple possibilities ranging from the classic minigun mount to minelaying.\n\nI can't say that the RTS elements work in its favor however, I feel the game would have been better off without. There's not enough depth in the strategic battles where Eddie sprouts wings, controls unit spawning and sending them into battle. Compared to the fast action paced face melting combos you were doing less than a minute ago, the slow RTS battles feel tedious and boring.\n\nThe characters all feel unique and genuine in their own way, the story feels right even though it may be just a little bit generic. The main quest line is fun to follow trough but side quests can get repetitive, mostly consisting of ambushes and the occasional defense against 5 waves of attackers. These are just bad attempts at prolonging the experience offered by the game.\n\nOverall this is a terrific game set in an cool world with an awesome soundtrack. It has its small little problems, but the goods far outweigh them. There's about 15 hours of gameplay here to complete everything there is to offer and to top it off a multiplayer mode that matches you against other players in RTS battles.","December 2, 2013","true","12.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

From the trailers I have seen back when it came out in 2009 I expected a funny, metal infused comedy put into a videogame, but I got so much more than that.\n\nYou would think that Jack Black and the all-star cast of voice actors is enough to sell the game but nuh-uh, there's more. The hilarious, epic and sometimes cheesy story works on so many levels if you ever had long hair, wore band shirts and maybe branched out to some make-up for the ultimate concert look. I never knew you could build up such a perfect metaphor for all the scenes and subgenres of Metal, yet it's no caricature and can stand perfectly on its own as a serious, comedic approach to the world of Metal music.\n\nYour ears will be spoiled with a fine selection of shredding guitars from Classic Rock over Hair Metal to Black Metal. In the first hours into the game I thought it was all about Classic and Glam Rock, but when I heard Carcass pop up I creamed my jeans and will definitely go through my old records, since my mouth is watering for Metal again!\n\nThis game left me stunned after it ended and this is probably the only downside of it.\nIt has an end.\n\n10 out of 10 metal horns!","October 10, 2015","true","17.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","3"

The world that is created and it's backstory are quite good and the various characters are fun as well. The story would be right at home on contemporary movie screens.\n\nThe main missions are mostly over-the-shoulder RTS type battles. I found these battles to be kind of hard and not very fun. Until I stopped trying to play them like an RTS, then they just weren't so hard. I avoided playing them for as long as possible by doing other stuff. There are collectables to be found, Jumps to make and side missions to do. Unfortunately there are only 5 different kinds of side missions; Hunting, Racing and 3 types of fighting. So not much variety there.  I even went after achievements to delay having to play a stage battle.\n\nI went with a mouse+keyboard+controller scheme. For me, Walking around and fighting will almost always be m+k and I much prefer a controller for driving (and of course playing solos). This made things a little messy as I had to relearn some things depending on what I was using. But I got it down for the last couple of battles.\n\nInteresting concept and groundwork, But not much else.

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #30: Brutal Legend\n\nBrutal Legend is an unapologetic love letter to hard rock and heavy metal music.  If you are a fan of this kind of music, that alone is enough for me to recommend this game.  But as it happens, Brutal Legend also happens to be pretty fun.\n\nThe story in Brutal Legend is pretty damn silly.  It's not meant to be taken seriously.  But if tongue-in-cheek humor is not what you are looking for, then you should look elsewhere because Brutal Legend brings it in spades.\n\nThe gameplay is a mix of combat and exploration.  The beginning is fairly combat heavy, but as I wrapped up my first hour of play I started to get a sense for more of an open world feel to the game.  Combat itself is fast paced.  You start with a huge axe for melee attacks, but you also get a guitar which shoots lightning (don't ask, just go with it).  But the game will also build on these basic attacks and unlock combination attacks and "guitar solos".\n\nAlong with the combat and exploration, the game also features vehicles.  It was a lot of fun the first time I hopped in a vehicle and started mowing over enemies.  I also did a boss fight entirely in vehicle, which offhand I can't remember ever doing that in a game before.\n\nI didn't find the gameplay terribly difficult, at least at the beginning.  I played on normal difficulty and did not find it to be much of a challenge.  But it's always hard to judge from the first hour of the game, as it's not unusual for the difficulty to ramp up as the game goes along.\n\nThe art is pretty solid.  The environments were pretty varied, but it's the character design that really stands out.  And as you would expect for a game playing homage to rock and metal, the soundtrack is magnificent.  I love that Brutal Legend has a real soundtrack and not just some generic guitar riffs.  It's a great mix of rock and metal.\n\nI had way too much fun with Brutal Legend not to recommend this.  Unless you just hate music, I don't think you'll be disappointed.","August 8, 2015","true","0.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aozgolo/recommended/225260/","aozgolo","Coelacanth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aozgolo/","851 products in account","A total gem by one of gaming's master humorists: Tim Schafer.\n\nThe game is nearly flawless with the only complaint I have being that there isn't MORE of it!\n\nAn excellent soundtrack that will please both Heavy Metal diehards as well as newcomers to the musical genre. It serves as an easy intro to a musical scene that might otherwise prove exclusionary to those who don't immediately "get it". Trust me by the end of this game, and probably long before you will understand what Heavy Metal is all about.\n\nTim Schafer is able to bring the more humorous and satirical elements of the musical genre to the forefront without once compromising it's soul. Let's examine closer though the actual game and it's facets:\n\nGAMEPLAY: While the bulk of the game is played as an action-adventure, there is a noticeable portion that is a real-time strategy meta-game, which has thrown some people off. Luckily one game-mode compliments the other and if you play around with it you should succeed.\n\nThe main action-adventure portions has you controlling the main character, Eddie Riggs, as he uses a battle axe to cleave through enemies, and a guitar that allows you to perform magical attacks and perform short "solos" which are quick time rythymn events to unlock special moves or summon a hot rod you can use to zip across the very large landscape.  You can upgrade your various weapons and hot rod by collecting fire tributes through various missions in underground garages. This has every aspect of an action adventure game you could possibly want, a HUGE open world, side missions, collectables that unlock new songs and background story, and lots of enemies to fight.\n\nThe real-time strategy missions utilize a similar control scheme but focuses you more on controlling large groups of your army you recruit. The gimmick is a little confusing at first and involves building merch booths on fan geysers to collect enough points to purchase more units to send into battle, but once you get the hang of it becomes quite enjoyable and rather intense. Aside from the army control, Eddie can also use his guitar solos to buff his soldiers or do combo-attacks with each of the select unit types for special damage. The units include Headbangers (Infantry), Razor Girls (Ranged), Thunderhog (Medic), Headsplitters (Ranged Vehicle), Bouncers (Anti-Vehicle Infantry), Roadie (Building Demolition), Fire Barons (Anti-Infantry Vehicle) Metal Beasts (Short Range Anti-Infantry), and Rock Crusher (Ranged Assault Vehicle) all of which have a double-team ability with Eddie.\n\n\nGRAPHICS: The game just looks great, it doesn't go for super realistic but has a very stylized look that at all times makes you think of Heavy Metal Album covers. The design of the world is deliberately gothic and looks like if H.R. Giger did paints of Norse Mythology. The skyscapes look breathtaking and the world is chock full of delicious eye candy that makes you just stop and take it all in. Truly exceptional!\n\nMUSIC: There's not much more to say, this is a Metalhead's wet dream. There are 20 original songs made for the primary campaign and 107 full length heavy metal songs that can be unlocked and played in-game through the Hot Rod's radio.\n\nVOICE ACTING: The main character Eddie is voiced by Jack Black and he does an amazing job of providing life to this character and making him truly enjoyable to watch and play as. The rest of the cast is all-star for Heavy Metal fans: Ozzy Osbourne, Lita Ford, Lemmy Kilmister, and Rob Halford, plus other known names like Tim Curry and Jennifer Hale round out the amazing vocal talents this game has.\n\nSTORY: The story is a lot of fun to experience, and while certainly not the best out there, it carries a lot of power and keeps you interested through-out. I only wished we got more of the story involving Succoria. By the time the game ends I felt ready to keep going!\n\n\n\nAll in all there's no reason not to play this game, if you enjoy good humor, awesome metal music, or just plain ole' fun action gameplay, this game will satisfy!","November 7, 2014","true","6.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Oh yeah, WITH THE GENERAL ♥♥♥♥ING INSANITY THIS GAME DELIVERS\n\nSeriously, I cannot think of a more, pure, unadultered Bad-♥♥♥ game. Nothing really tops this game on the "hardcore" scale.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nEnough chatter, time for the game.\n\nThe game is surprisingly well-made, and no wonder since Double Fine, the dev team, made some perfect classic action games like Psychonauts. They had the experience and you can see it in-game.\n\nI have to say the best thing about this game is the audio. MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING METAL. Apart from the astonishing soundtrack, the voice acting is godly and it features sacred metal beasts like Jack Black and Ozzy Osbourne, to name a few. Solid, solid voice acting and music. Your ears will experience ♥♥♥♥♥♥s in this game.\n\nJUST LISTEN\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WS57pNIq9A\n\nA very, very, very strong point about this game is its story. I won't even go into detail as to not spoil it, but it's absolutely GREAT. Characters are very well portrayed. Cartoonish elements and humor are abundant, giving this game a one-of-a-kind flavour. One of the best cutscenes in the gaming industry. I don't even know if you can skip cutscenes or not, but no one is complaining! I never felt the need to skip a single cutscene!\n\nGame-mechanics wise, I must say it's pretty good. It has visceral combat, a progression system, customisation, free-roam, missions, metal solos. Double Fine did a great job and the game is just fun to play, though I must say the game itself is not the center of attraction here, like many hack-n-slash action games.\n\nGame graphics are just great. Some eye-candy moments throughout the games, but the character animations and expressions are the best. The universe is 100% awesome.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThe game delivers a moral, and that's the passion for metal, which I was not a big fan when I first stepped in and now, well, let's say I had a change of heart.\n\nTHE HEART OF METAL\n\n♥♥♥♥ING BRUTAL GAME AND YOU SHOULD KEEP AN EYE FOR IT\n\n8/10","December 6, 2013","true","5.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

You can get lost in the design of the mountains and the structures around the land and you can enjoy a ride with good metal music in the background.\n\nThe enemies are very good designed and the voice acting is great. There's no enemy or ally that annoys you with their voice and they are all useful.\n\nThe battle system it's 3D Zelda based and you can unlock stuff the same way Link does it. Play the guitar to summon your car, to activate structures, to call a zeppelin on fire that insta-kill everyone around you when it crashes. It's good.\n\nThe only bad thing it's the lack of jumping.

It's a decent game. Combining real-time strategy with action-adventure, Brütal Legend tells a story about the main character Eddie Riggs who helps Lars, Lita and Ophelia create an army to fight against the evil antagonist, in a heavy metal inspired world. The gameplay mechanics itself can be confusing, and controls aren't really comfortable. You can travel in an open world and do side missions, or continue the main story, which unfortunately only lasts about six hours. While doing the main story, you get to do these 'stage  battles', that's where the real-time strategy comes into play.\n\nThe game is supported by some absolutely awesome heavy metal music. Featuring over 100 great songs from popular artists like Motörhead, Megadeth, Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne, and many more, as well as a lot of excellent less known bands. Some voices have been done by musicians including Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Ozzy Osbourne and more. Not only the music but also the visuals are quite appealing, with lots of different themed areas and a unique graphical style. The story is fun, there's some good humour and the characters are very interesting. Truly a joy to play for metal fans, and still worth trying if you're not.\n\nGameplay however is lacking things. The controls aren't optimal and can be very confusing, even though the game tries its best to explain them. The hack-and-slash parts are pretty good, but the real-time strategy parts can be a bit overwhelming seeing as how much you have to handle at a time. The story is really short, clocking at about only six hours. There's a decent amount of side stuff to do, and dispite the flaws it's still fun to play.\n\nIf you like heavy metal music, dark themes, and like the idea of real-time strategy combined with action-adventure and hack-and-slash, then this game might be just for you. The game might not be great in terms of gameplay mechanics, but the concept is still awesome; and so is the music!","February 2, 2015","true","9.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","10","15","2","0"

Whether you’re cruising around in the Deuce or just wandering around seeing the sights, the blend of well known metal music and original composition is glorious.\n\nThere is a satisfyingly ample amount of items for you to unlock in the “Motor Forge”.

The game is over well before the mechanics prove to be tiresome and while it's not the biggest game, the ride you do get is immensely entertaining.","July 25, 2014","true","8.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I think they succeded to make a game very much like Jack Blacks personality with The D in the background on some sidequests as well as Ozzy as the gaurdian of Metal and many others! The gameplay itself has alot of metal with awesome solos like swords hitting the ground or the skill to melt faces around you, and that's just some of them.\n\nWhen it comes to the sidequests many of them are much alike, but they aren't less fun because of that, though the best thing in this game must be Eddies comments during the game as well as the other characters comments when killing someone and in the cutscenes. This is something that makes the game very much enjoyable! Another important thing to mention is that this is a game that you can play for a very long time and some achievements are actually hard to achieve like the one were you need to play with someone who has the achievement by playing with someone else with the same achievement, a very annoying concept I must say. Well, this game is GREAT! I had alot of fun and I think the story was very interesting and made the roadie a star for a change, though I won't spoil anything!

An engaging storyline, clever comedy, star appeal, excellent graphic design, and even an awesome soundtrack. I've never been into rock or metal much, but this game has left me with an open mind about this sort of music and have been on something of a rock and metal musical quest ever since playing Brutal Legend.

That should be enough.\nWhat about the game play?\nWell it's like dynasty warriors met with Age of Empires and they had better art work and imagination then a college full of  diehard 21st century artists.\nThe onle real problem with this game is the storymode is too short even though the world is MASSIVE,\nNot only is it BIG but BEAUTIFUL! They really put effort into everything in this game world I explored everyinch of it becuase it was literal art. It makes the 150+ collectables fun.

You could literally do more productive things than collect things that just add up towards some achievement that no one will apperciate but yourself. But when you do it in Burtal Legend, you're doing it to a soundtrack that even now beats out Grand Theft Auto 5's.\n\nIt's gory with Limbs flying off and literal face melting, this was probably Jack Blacks last best thing he did...before Goosebumbs...\nAnyway, for  $15 you're gonna have a good time.

You'll be accelerating and decelerating at different rates, and this gave me a lot of nausea. If fast-moving games give you the same problem, then Brutal Legend may have the same effect.\n\nThat aside, Brutal Legend is more an experience rather than a game. Set in an intricately-designed landscape inspired by metal album covers, you step into the shoes of Jack Black/Eddie Riggs as you headbang your way through your foes in defense of all things Metal and righteous. As you progress through the main campaign, you will recruit hearty groups of warriors to your cause, adding to an army that will help you rock your way to victory.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is lacking. There are three main "mini-games" that Brutal Legend will keep bringing you back to: Third-Person Hack&Slash Action, Real-Time Strategy, and Driving. Main Campaign missions will typically focus on one of these  aspects, but frankly I never felt engaged enough with any of them.\n\nWith Hack&Slash Action, I just waded in and mashed the attack buttons, occasionally circling to avoid getting hit and letting my health regen. Fights are chaotic masses of blood and special effects, making it hard for me to know what I did beyond haphazard slashing, or what can or did kill me and what I could've done to avoid that. With Real-Time Strategy, I spammed unit-building and just charged en masse to whatever needed killing the most. That's my own single-mindedness at fault more than anything, but the unit-selection wheel was hard to manage with the mouse which led me to my less-involved approach. Finally, with Driving, in addition to my nausea, control of my vehicle didn't feel smooth and made it even less enjoyable for me.\n\nAlso, there is a multiplayer option that focuses on the RTS aspect of Brutal Legend. I tried it once, but the same objections I had for the gameplay earlier apply here as well. Also, odds are good that you'll be facing a lot of players with much more RTS experience, so try out AI opponents first.\n\nOverall, I actually do still recommend this game; despite my grievances, I did still enjoy the well-designed setting, and the story, and Jack Black as Eddie Riggs is a very relatable protagonist. However, I recommend this only as an interactive open-world movie that you only need to go through once, and only to fans of heavy metal and/or Jack Black, and also if said fans aren't prone to motion sickness.\n\nNote for OCD Collectors: Brutal Legend also has a lot of "collectibles" in the game, and fortunately once you finish the main campaign...  you can get an item that acts as a collectible compass. It won't mark them out for you explicitly on the map, but it will save you a few hours of squinting and searching.","December 29, 2013","true","14.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Then I saw it on sale on steam and I figured I would give it a try. I am not a huge metal fan. Before I played this game I was into some metal but, I never really heard of a lot of these classic metal bands. This game changed all of that, as soon as I began playing I got into the metal theme and music. The game is about a roadie named  Eddie Riggs (Jack Black) who is transported to a metal themed world after a terrible accident at a concert. This game features a Stellar sound track and cast, as well as a unique concept. The game play is a mix between some basic hack n slash, drive/shoot mechanics and some RTS elements. I am one of the people that didn't enjoy the RTS elements of the game, wich require you to play guitar solos to build fan booths on predetermined points used to spawn allies. You also get demon wings during these sections that allow you to move across the battlefield and command your army. The first time was fun but, after that it became tedious and somewhat frustrating. Though I do appreciate the unique use of RTS elements. However, this didn't stop me from enjoying the rest of the game because I liked the other elements of the game enough to force myself to get through the RTS sections. All in all I enjoyed the game and I couldn't be happier with my purchase if only to introduce me to some kick a$$ metal that I had missed out on for the first 21 years of my life. If you appreciate unique ideas, good music, good humor, and a strong cast, then I would recommend this game. If you have doubts then wait until it's on sell, at that point you can't go wrong.  \m/ Rock on!","September 4, 2014","true","12.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You like epic stories? You like smashing heads with a war axe and toasting bodies with sorcery?\nThen this is the game for you.\nAs a Xbox import title it is ok. The controls are completelly fine but the graphic setting options are pretty poor.\nThe game's graphics are not focused on insate depiction of details and realism, but they serve their purpose very well bringing the player into a world of nightmarish and metal epicness.\nThe story is not set on legit ground, but is simple and balanced. A hero rises. Fights through will wining and falling. And wins the girl in the end.\nThe direction is great. The environment is inspiring and the music selections are of course super awesome.\nThe characters are awesome. Most people know that teh hero's voice and face is Jack Black, and there are also characters with teh voice and face of Ozzy Osbourne and Lemmy Kilmister.\nBut you will be surpriced to see and hear a lot more celebs that have not been promoted in the trailers.\nFight system is great and has nice simple animations and doesn't get boring. You can use your axe to slash and smash and behead and rip your enemies apart, or you can use your guitar to burn and electrify them by playing music, or cast some spells by playing specific "musical spells" and summon buffs for you allies, curses for the enemy, special attacks (inclusing a huge falling zeppelin on fire - hard to miss the point if you are into this kind of music) and also used to summon animals to aid you or ride later on and a very cool hot rod car that you can modify.\n\n\n\nDefo recommended.\nThis game is dope.","July 23, 2013","true","21.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yucko69/recommended/225260/","yucko69","Filthy Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yucko69/","61 products in account","(Disclaimer: This is a completely un-ironic and non-satirical review. Most of my other reviews are silly and are supposed to be funny, but this is a 100% true account of this video game.)\n\nI know that at the time of me writing this review, it says that I have barely any hours put into this game. This is true for the PC, as I just bought it on sale. However, already having 150+ hours on console, I feel that I can effectively write a review of this game. Brutal Legend has been, since I bought it in early 2010, one of my favorite video games of all time. I do not say this lightly; this game has touched me personally and changed me. This game introduced me largely to what i am today.\nFirst, a little backstory. I was blessed with a very musical family. Me, my brother, and my father all play instruments, and I have been around guitars and hard rock ranging from ACDC to Metallica from a young age. My parents are both fans of metal, and so from a young age, I listened to music like Iron Maiden, Motley Crue, and Dragonforce, just to name a few. One of the earliest band shirts I ever remember wearing was an Iron Maiden shirt in first grade.\nVideo game have also been a medium for my family for years; we've had consoles ranging from the Saturn to the Dreamcast to the N64 to the PS1 to the original Xbox, and we still have a plethora of consoles to this day. I have always been a fan of video games, and luckily my parents don't mind what kind I play; in fact, some of my fondest memories were of playing Halo 2 system link with my parents in their room and me and my older brother in the living room (my father drilled a hole in our wall to make this possible).\nAnyways, shortly after the game came out (about February 2010) we went to Best Buy. I had some money left over from my birthday in January (I believe I just turned 11, and was in fifth grade), and I wanted to get a video game. The choice came down to Red Faction: Guerrilla or Brutal Legend. After carefully reading the backs, I decided I had to choose: destruction, or heavy metal? I ended up buying Brutal Legend; however, I did buy Red Faction a few months later.\nSo I went home, and it being a weekend, I played the game for hours. I beat the game in a few days, but continued to play it for much longer. I believe that the last time I've played, I had every tab, and I know I had every upgrade. I beat the game on Brutal at one point. I believed this game was pure perfection. When I was younger, as I've said, I only really listened to some baby metal; this game showed me the wonders of different subgenres. I've come a long way over the years, all thanks to this game. I started out with bands like Dethklok, and now I listen to all different types of metal, with my favorite being Atmospheric Black Metal along the lines of Summoning and Drudkh. This game was the reason for all of this.\nAnother amazing aspect of the game was simply the detail in the characters and the world. I found the game mesmerizing as a child, and believed it was hilarious; not just in the dialogue, but the depiction of the stereotypes. I remember laughing with my father as he expressed amazement at the fact that Lemmy, Ozzy, and Halford were in the game. I remember thinking it was the funniest thing as I reamed goth people in a car while blaring speed metal. I remember the depictions of Hair Metal kids as sellouts, and loving it. Understanding the references may not be hard, but for a fifth grader, it was liberating, finally being able to understand comedy.\nAs for the gameplay itself, the game isn't that amazing. Basic combat and the clunky RTS elements make it a bit awkward, but the game more than makes up for it in sentimental value and world design. I eagerly, and relatively naively await the day that Double Fine announces Brutal Legend 2, despite the fact that it probably won't even happen. When it does, it will be among one of the games that I have preordered, a list that as of now only consists of Bioshock 2 (a severe disappointment in my eyes) and Dark Souls 2.\nIn conclusion, Brutal Legend is an amazing game that has a special place in my heart. This review may not be too helpful, as I recognize the fact that it's all sweaty fanboy-ism, but I felt that I had to let other people in on a personal experience I've had with the game. If you are a fan of heavy metal, play this game. If you aren't a fan of heavy metal, still play this game, because the amount of detail and the humor are still enjoyable. Plus, maybe it could broaden your musical tastes and FORCE you to like metal! In any case, I cannot recommend this game enough. I have had more enjoyment with this game and hold it in higher esteem than any other, except perhaps Dark Souls. This game changed me as a human being, for better or for worse, and while it may not touch you in the same way that it touched a cringy antisocial preteen (THAT SENTENCE SHOULD NEVER COME OUT OF ANYONE'S MOUTH), you may still find some enjoyment in it. Hell, if you buy it on sale, you pretty much just spent three bucks on "Drive Around and Kill ♥♥♥♥ While Metal Plays Simulator". If you can't find enjoyment in that, I feel sorry for you.","May 24, 2015","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Game is filled with humor, has an interesting story, great voiceacting, great soundtrack/music and fun characters. Some fun mechanics like using people that are part of bands/concerts as units to attack enemies, melting people's faces with guitar sounds, also metal themed weaponised car. Only flaws with this game i think is the controls. This is not designed well for keyboards, so you'll have tough time using one. And controlling a car in missions where you must avoid stuff is really really annoying.","February 17, 2015","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/recommended/225260/","Brotmeister","Hans Brotmeister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/","352 products in account","Brütal legend is a third person action adventure that incorporates gameplay elements from various different genres.\n\nThe roadie Eddie Riggs is transported to a world in which all the over the top heavy metal imagery one knows from album covers is actually real. He quickly learns that the humans who live here are under threat by a demon emperor named Doviculus who installed a puppet government led by a man  called General Lionwhyte. While Eddie does not want to be a hero and actually hates to stay in the spotlight he gets caught up in the revolution against the demons and decides to do what he can to liberate mankind. Soon Eddie finds out that his presence in this world may not be a mere coincidence and that there's something connecting him to it.\n\nBrütal Legend clearly isn't the conventional type of game. It encompasses elements of hack&slash, open world driving, real time strategy and a bit of guitar hero. It plays like a mix of hack and slash, real time strategy, sandbox and a little bit of guitar hero. Eddie fights using his axe as well as his guitar. While the axe is obviously a melee weapon the guitar can be used to execute ranged attacks as well as solos. While many solos are obtained naturally while progressing to through the game some have to be found. Every solo has a unique effect that can be triggered by playing the solo through hitting the right buttons at the right time. For example there is a solo which summons allied beasts as well as another one that causes mass destruction via the crash of a giant burning zeppelin. Eddie can also run over enemies using his car. Later the car can be upgraded with a variety of weapons. The car has one slot for a high range weapon that shoots from the front as well as a for short range weapon that shoots from the sides of the car.\n\nAfter the introduction Eddie is free to explore the world and either follow the main quest, various side quests or search for collectibles. Collectibles mostly come as songs for your car stereo but can also be guitar solos. Upgrades and sidegrades can be purchased at the Guardian of Metal who resides in the underground Motor Forge. Entrances to the Motor Forge can be found all over the land.\n\nAt some point in the game Brütal Legend introduces real-time strategy elements that will from that point on play an important role. When a battle is coming up both factions construct a stage where units can be recruited. Recruiting units costs fans and while you gain fans over time capturing checkpoints greatly speeds up the process. During a strategy battle you still control Eddie in a third person perspective. While recruiting units, issuing orders and setting up rally points you can yourself take part in the battle by attacking or using solos. You can also perform combo attacks which are different depending on the unit you combo with. For example comboing with Headbangers creates a mosh pit. If you die you respawn at your stage. The stage can be upgraded two times during the battle to unlock higher tier units. You win as soon as the enemies' stage is destroyed. Brütal Legend's multiplayer part consists of those real time strategy battles. There are three playable factions in multiplayer: Ironheade - the band-army of Eddie and his allies, the goth-themed Drowning Doom and Tainted Coil - the army of Doviculus the demon emperor. The fourth faction present in the campaign, the glam-metal themed army of General Lionwhyte, is not playable since it consists of recolors of Ironheade's units.\n\nBrütal Legend features some great cameos like Jack Black as Eddie Riggs, Ozzy Osbourne as the Guardian of Metal, Lemmy Kilmister as the Kill Master, Rob Halford as the Baron as well as General Lionwhyte and Kyle Gass as Kage the Kannonier. Also, Jennifer Hale, Tim Curry and Lita Ford do non-cameo voice acting as Ophelia, Doviculus and Rima.\n\nDue to the amount of gameplay elements none of them have been implemented as in a game that solely focuses on those. Brütal Legend has hack&slash gameplay but it's not a Devil May Cry or Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. If features open world driving but it's not a Saint's Row or GTA. It has real-time strategy but it's surely not a Starcraft or Command & Conquer. Also the solos are certainly not something out of Guitar Hero. What's more, the sidequests are often carbon copies of one another and thus can be very bland and repetitive. Also due to problems during development the game is not as long as it was originally meant to be. One whole faction which was originally planned is not present in the actual game. Also, the strategy elements are introduced rather late in the game considering the central role they play from that point on.\n\nBrütal Legend is a mix of genres that kind of created its own genre. For some players that might indeed come off as weird and or too experimental. Also as stated above the game lacks polish in various places. However there are many things Brütal Legend gets right with its lovable characters, humorous tone, and glorious world, epic music and art design. Thus I still recommend it. If you are not afraid of trying something new and original and if you are a music fan you should give Brütal Legend a try.\n\nMore reviews here","April 30, 2013","true","56.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And we all know that that means...\n\nThere are three qualities to this game that make it worthy of the hype it has gotten. For Simplicity's sake, I'll label them.\n\nIt's true to the source material.\nThis is suprising since the source material is just Metal. Metal songs, and metal cover art, and that's it. Now drive around the land that the game takes place in, and tell me that you can't take a screenshot of ANY LANDMARK, slap a random cover title on it, and tell someone that it's a real CD cover. This is quite spectacular, but it's nothing for Double Fine. They seem to specialize in surreal locations that others couldn't imagine existing. They made Psychonauts, after all. They also use metal instruments for all background songs. ALL OF THEM. (Sadly, you won't hear it that often because you're too busy listening to the 107+ metal songs on the radio in your car) If you are a hardcore Metal fan, you won't be disappointed.\n\nCharacters applenty.\nAs a Double Fine game, it makes sense that every character has lines for any situation that they can get into in game. Your allies sees Eddie play a song? Compliments come in. They see Eddie take off? They can say that your wings look cool, or tell you not to leave them, depending on the circumstances. Also, the commentary is hilarious. The guy that takes the case though, is Eddie Riggs, the main character, who is voiced by Jack Black (the voice behind Po in Kung Fu Panda, among others). He takes the cake by staying true to the character of a Metal Roadie thrusted into the world of Brutal Legends, all the while showing off his incredible comedy skills.\n\nReal Time Strategy goes fast paced.\nNow, when have you heard strategy and intense being used together. At all? It's incredibly rare, and hard to pull off, but Brutal Legends did it. They made a Strategy game that's more than amassing troops and sending them at the enemy base before they reach yours (Although that still works). With nuke solos, powerful double teams, and various other nasty tricks to pull, the RTS element of the game, the Multiplayer Stage Battles, is incredible, capable of turning the tables with the right move, and mixing hack and slash into there so you can join the fun of killing your enemy's troops over and over again! And with three different factions, each with their own playstyle and strategies to pull off, you can enjoy it again and again.\n\nIf you kile RTS games, Metal, or the works of Double Fine, this is a game that won't disapoint. If you have an aversion to any of these, then run now, and never come back.","January 28, 2014","true","111.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is one of the best action games I've played for quite some time and HELL IT HAS JACK BLACK IN IT! If you're wondering about the soundtrack well, it's what you expect, Man O War, Omen, Black Sabbath, Anvil, Brocas Helm, Children of Bodom, Cradle of Filth, Dark Tranquility, Dimmu Borgir, Megadeth amongst many others, as you can see it's a pretty good line up. NOW BEWARE, the controls may feel abit clunky at first because this is a  Xbox 360 port and a very bad one if you ask me, after a while I eventually got used to the controls. It is an open world game with side quests and mini-quests that along with the main storyline mission may provide you around +18 hours of gameplay. The voice acting is quite good and it features tons of "metal legends" themselves in the game. Overall I would say that it's a quite good game considering how old it is but I find it sad that Double Fine didn't do a better job in porting the game to PC, that said I'm sure that some people will find the game worth the full price and I strongly recommend those to pick it up.","June 22, 2013","true","15.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yucko69/recommended/225260/","yucko69","Filthy Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yucko69/","61 products in account","(Disclaimer: This is a completely un-ironic and non-satirical review. Most of my other reviews are silly and are supposed to be funny, but this is a 100% true account of this video game.)\n\nI know that at the time of me writing this review, it says that I have barely any hours put into this game. This is true for the PC, as I just bought it on sale. However, already having 150+ hours on console, I feel that I can effectively write a review of this game. Brutal Legend has been, since I bought it in early 2010, one of my favorite video games of all time. I do not say this lightly; this game has touched me personally and changed me. This game introduced me largely to what i am today.\nFirst, a little backstory. I was blessed with a very musical family. Me, my brother, and my father all play instruments, and I have been around guitars and hard rock ranging from ACDC to Metallica from a young age. My parents are both fans of metal, and so from a young age, I listened to music like Iron Maiden, Motley Crue, and Dragonforce, just to name a few. One of the earliest band shirts I ever remember wearing was an Iron Maiden shirt in first grade.\nVideo game have also been a medium for my family for years; we've had consoles ranging from the Saturn to the Dreamcast to the N64 to the PS1 to the original Xbox, and we still have a plethora of consoles to this day. I have always been a fan of video games, and luckily my parents don't mind what kind I play; in fact, some of my fondest memories were of playing Halo 2 system link with my parents in their room and me and my older brother in the living room (my father drilled a hole in our wall to make this possible).\nAnyways, shortly after the game came out (about February 2010) we went to Best Buy. I had some money left over from my birthday in January (I believe I just turned 11, and was in fifth grade), and I wanted to get a video game. The choice came down to Red Faction: Guerrilla or Brutal Legend. After carefully reading the backs, I decided I had to choose: destruction, or heavy metal? I ended up buying Brutal Legend; however, I did buy Red Faction a few months later.\nSo I went home, and it being a weekend, I played the game for hours. I beat the game in a few days, but continued to play it for much longer. I believe that the last time I've played, I had every tab, and I know I had every upgrade. I beat the game on Brutal at one point. I believed this game was pure perfection. When I was younger, as I've said, I only really listened to some baby metal; this game showed me the wonders of different subgenres. I've come a long way over the years, all thanks to this game. I started out with bands like Dethklok, and now I listen to all different types of metal, with my favorite being Atmospheric Black Metal along the lines of Summoning and Drudkh. This game was the reason for all of this.\nAnother amazing aspect of the game was simply the detail in the characters and the world. I found the game mesmerizing as a child, and believed it was hilarious; not just in the dialogue, but the depiction of the stereotypes. I remember laughing with my father as he expressed amazement at the fact that Lemmy, Ozzy, and Halford were in the game. I remember thinking it was the funniest thing as I reamed goth people in a car while blaring speed metal. I remember the depictions of Hair Metal kids as sellouts, and loving it. Understanding the references may not be hard, but for a fifth grader, it was liberating, finally being able to understand comedy.\nAs for the gameplay itself, the game isn't that amazing. Basic combat and the clunky RTS elements make it a bit awkward, but the game more than makes up for it in sentimental value and world design. I eagerly, and relatively naively await the day that Double Fine announces Brutal Legend 2, despite the fact that it probably won't even happen. When it does, it will be among one of the games that I have preordered, a list that as of now only consists of Bioshock 2 (a severe disappointment in my eyes) and Dark Souls 2.\nIn conclusion, Brutal Legend is an amazing game that has a special place in my heart. This review may not be too helpful, as I recognize the fact that it's all sweaty fanboy-ism, but I felt that I had to let other people in on a personal experience I've had with the game. If you are a fan of heavy metal, play this game. If you aren't a fan of heavy metal, still play this game, because the amount of detail and the humor are still enjoyable. Plus, maybe it could broaden your musical tastes and FORCE you to like metal! In any case, I cannot recommend this game enough. I have had more enjoyment with this game and hold it in higher esteem than any other, except perhaps Dark Souls. This game changed me as a human being, for better or for worse, and while it may not touch you in the same way that it touched a cringy antisocial preteen (THAT SENTENCE SHOULD NEVER COME OUT OF ANYONE'S MOUTH), you may still find some enjoyment in it. Hell, if you buy it on sale, you pretty much just spent three bucks on "Drive Around and Kill ♥♥♥♥ While Metal Plays Simulator". If you can't find enjoyment in that, I feel sorry for you.","May 24, 2015","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A game made by metalheads for metalheads like me.\n\nThe characters, oh god, they are cool, and not because they look cool, it's because they are some of the most respected musicians out there, like Jack Black, Lemmy Kilmister, Ozzy Osbourne, Rob ****ing Halford!. The combat is what I'm used to do on these games, just run around, find an enemy, axe it till it's dead. Yeah, it can be repetitive and boring, but with such a world to explore, you'll have fun uncovering secrets while going on a killing spree with your lovely axe and guitar.\n\nAnd of course, what's a Heavy Metal game without Heavy Metal music? Well, don't panic, this one comes loaded of Metal tracks just to pleasure your ears. The soundtrack goes from KISS, Megadeth, Judas Priest, Slayer and many others. Though I prefer Death Metal, there's little of it on the game. I wish it had a song from Death on the soundtrack, like "Together as One" or "Flesh and the Power it Holds".\n\nOverall, this game will keep you entertained during many hours, just enjoying jamming your guitars to shock (literally) your enemies and then fend them off with your trusty Axe. If you are an open-minded metalhead or just someone looking for a bit of fun while slashing enemies, give this a try, you won't regret it.","December 4, 2013","true","20.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/recommended/225260/","Brotmeister","Hans Brotmeister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/","352 products in account","Brütal legend is a third person action adventure that incorporates gameplay elements from various different genres.\n\nThe roadie Eddie Riggs is transported to a world in which all the over the top heavy metal imagery one knows from album covers is actually real. He quickly learns that the humans who live here are under threat by a demon emperor named Doviculus who installed a puppet government led by a man  called General Lionwhyte. While Eddie does not want to be a hero and actually hates to stay in the spotlight he gets caught up in the revolution against the demons and decides to do what he can to liberate mankind. Soon Eddie finds out that his presence in this world may not be a mere coincidence and that there's something connecting him to it.\n\nBrütal Legend clearly isn't the conventional type of game. It encompasses elements of hack&slash, open world driving, real time strategy and a bit of guitar hero. It plays like a mix of hack and slash, real time strategy, sandbox and a little bit of guitar hero. Eddie fights using his axe as well as his guitar. While the axe is obviously a melee weapon the guitar can be used to execute ranged attacks as well as solos. While many solos are obtained naturally while progressing to through the game some have to be found. Every solo has a unique effect that can be triggered by playing the solo through hitting the right buttons at the right time. For example there is a solo which summons allied beasts as well as another one that causes mass destruction via the crash of a giant burning zeppelin. Eddie can also run over enemies using his car. Later the car can be upgraded with a variety of weapons. The car has one slot for a high range weapon that shoots from the front as well as a for short range weapon that shoots from the sides of the car.\n\nAfter the introduction Eddie is free to explore the world and either follow the main quest, various side quests or search for collectibles. Collectibles mostly come as songs for your car stereo but can also be guitar solos. Upgrades and sidegrades can be purchased at the Guardian of Metal who resides in the underground Motor Forge. Entrances to the Motor Forge can be found all over the land.\n\nAt some point in the game Brütal Legend introduces real-time strategy elements that will from that point on play an important role. When a battle is coming up both factions construct a stage where units can be recruited. Recruiting units costs fans and while you gain fans over time capturing checkpoints greatly speeds up the process. During a strategy battle you still control Eddie in a third person perspective. While recruiting units, issuing orders and setting up rally points you can yourself take part in the battle by attacking or using solos. You can also perform combo attacks which are different depending on the unit you combo with. For example comboing with Headbangers creates a mosh pit. If you die you respawn at your stage. The stage can be upgraded two times during the battle to unlock higher tier units. You win as soon as the enemies' stage is destroyed. Brütal Legend's multiplayer part consists of those real time strategy battles. There are three playable factions in multiplayer: Ironheade - the band-army of Eddie and his allies, the goth-themed Drowning Doom and Tainted Coil - the army of Doviculus the demon emperor. The fourth faction present in the campaign, the glam-metal themed army of General Lionwhyte, is not playable since it consists of recolors of Ironheade's units.\n\nBrütal Legend features some great cameos like Jack Black as Eddie Riggs, Ozzy Osbourne as the Guardian of Metal, Lemmy Kilmister as the Kill Master, Rob Halford as the Baron as well as General Lionwhyte and Kyle Gass as Kage the Kannonier. Also, Jennifer Hale, Tim Curry and Lita Ford do non-cameo voice acting as Ophelia, Doviculus and Rima.\n\nDue to the amount of gameplay elements none of them have been implemented as in a game that solely focuses on those. Brütal Legend has hack&slash gameplay but it's not a Devil May Cry or Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. If features open world driving but it's not a Saint's Row or GTA. It has real-time strategy but it's surely not a Starcraft or Command & Conquer. Also the solos are certainly not something out of Guitar Hero. What's more, the sidequests are often carbon copies of one another and thus can be very bland and repetitive. Also due to problems during development the game is not as long as it was originally meant to be. One whole faction which was originally planned is not present in the actual game. Also, the strategy elements are introduced rather late in the game considering the central role they play from that point on.\n\nBrütal Legend is a mix of genres that kind of created its own genre. For some players that might indeed come off as weird and or too experimental. Also as stated above the game lacks polish in various places. However there are many things Brütal Legend gets right with its lovable characters, humorous tone, and glorious world, epic music and art design. Thus I still recommend it. If you are not afraid of trying something new and original and if you are a music fan you should give Brütal Legend a try.\n\nMore reviews here","April 30, 2013","true","56.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Animation does get buggy at times, but seldom enough to rip you from the experience.\n\nThe music and soundtrack for this game is exceptional for enthusiasts.  A solid variety of tunes from various genres of metal are sure to appease all but the most discerning of music palettes.  Voice acting is top notch for the most part, at least when it comes to the big name VAs.\n\nStory holds your attention.  It's not going to reverberate in your mind when you're done playing the game, but isn't so awful that it gets in the way of your enjoyment.  The humor and dialogue holds up alright, but again, won't win any awards.  Your love of the writing will likely be based on your love of Jack Black or the various musicians/actors who cameoed in this game.\n\nWhere the game still falls short to this day is its attempt to make a console friendly RTS.  Controls are streamlined enough to only allow for the broadest of unit management.  Keyboard and mouse controls do help, but little effort was made to properly port this title to PC (game still uses a controller friendly radial menu for Solos and army building for instance).  This can sadly make some of the RTS segments feel like a grind compared to the action portion of the title, especially if you're struggling to get through a segment to advance the game.\n\nThe action controls also sadly suffer in the PC port.  Having to hold a lock button down in order to dodge feels wrong, and not allowing the player to remap it as a toggle switch discourages its use entirely.  Futzing with the radial menu for solos will require adapation to feel natural.  Thankfully, mouse control for camera does alleviate some of the control issues with the previous game.  The driving also feels better in the PC port compared to the console.\n\nOnline community has largely left this game, but the campaign and single player experience is certainly worth the buy in.  The map is impressive in size and hides all sorts of secret goodies that will have you hunting around for a good deal of hours if you're the completionist type.  Driving is a thrill and just cruising around the map while a favorite song plays on the radio can hold your interest.  Side missions give you lots to do, but it can get very samey very quickly (So many Ironheade sneak attack missions are the exact same setup).  The game gives you plenty of fire tributes (in game currency used to purchase upgrades), so you can thankfully cherry pick those mini games that appeal to you, or simply harvest them from the collectibles.\n\nSadly, because the online community has left, you're opportunities to play as the other factions within the game are limited principally to AI skirmishes.\n\nBugs do creep up from time to time.  Minor visual bugs can take you out of a cutscene, but haven't yet cropped up during gameplay.  Game has crashed to desktop on me once, but no progress was lost due to rigorous auto-save system and being fortunate enough to not be on a mission.  Moving in and out of the map and menus can also be an inconsistent experience (sometimes pausing the game, sometimes not).\n\nDespite my issues with the game overall, it's still very playable.  It is both a tribute to metal while itself being a work of visual and auditory art.  If metal music or culture are of any interest to you or if you ever wanted to try a game that's a chunky blend of God of War, Grand Theft Auto and Dawn of War, this game is worth a purchase.  Those seeking a competitive RTS experience should look elsewhere.","January 18","true","4.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

This is one of the best action games I've played for quite some time and HELL IT HAS JACK BLACK IN IT! If you're wondering about the soundtrack well, it's what you expect, Man O War, Omen, Black Sabbath, Anvil, Brocas Helm, Children of Bodom, Cradle of Filth, Dark Tranquility, Dimmu Borgir, Megadeth amongst many others, as you can see it's a pretty good line up. NOW BEWARE, the controls may feel abit clunky at first because this is a  Xbox 360 port and a very bad one if you ask me, after a while I eventually got used to the controls. It is an open world game with side quests and mini-quests that along with the main storyline mission may provide you around +18 hours of gameplay. The voice acting is quite good and it features tons of "metal legends" themselves in the game. Overall I would say that it's a quite good game considering how old it is but I find it sad that Double Fine didn't do a better job in porting the game to PC, that said I'm sure that some people will find the game worth the full price and I strongly recommend those to pick it up.","June 22, 2013","true","15.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To be honest the gameplay itself isn't very original and the combat is repetitive to say the least, but these are not the things you love Brutal Legend for. The main feature is the sound and dialogs and believe me they are great. Yeah, the humor is somewhat simple and yeah the plot makes as much sense as in porn movie but this game gives you the mood, gives you the sense... Hell, it gives you the SPIRIT of heavy metal. I've been enjoying every single moment of Brutal Legend. It's worth every f******g cent I paid for it.\n\nOh, and one more thing. If you won't be making "horns" with your index and little finger while playing Brutal Legend, you are stale and heartless person. : )","December 5, 2013","true","5.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

What's up with that ? For starters, Brutal Legend is a game that has to be experienced. It's an open world action adventure with a few RTS elements added to it (more on that in a bit).\n\nThink of any open world game, add a heavy metal flavour to this world, throw some heavy metal music in there as well and voila, you pretty much have Brutal Legend.\n\nIt's charming, looks great and above all, it's fun. Except for one thing... Which brings me back to the RTS part. There are a few missions where you have to build an army and engage your enemies in combat, RTS style. And even though it works - it's perfectly playable - it just... It just isn't any fun. It's more of a chore when I think about it. This part is the only negative thing I can think of.\nBut, don't let that keep you from buying it. Brutal Legend, like most of the Double Fine games, is one brilliant game. Do yourself a favor and just buy it already.\n\n[Rating: 84/100]","February 17, 2013","true","15.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it’s a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. If you don't already own this game, then you are missing out BIG TIME.Brutal Legend was released on the 26th Feburary 2013 and i am loving this game so far, In this game it has everything a human wants  in a ,Film Music, Entertainment , Comedy, Action and lots more. This game is superb, It is controller supported so i recommend you play with a controller and the driving, the killing is all fantastic.\n\nPros:\n- Humorous.\n- Good Driving.\n- Good actions.\n- Easy to play.\n- Liking the single-player.\n\nCons :\n- The combat is weak.\n- Freedom of the explorable open world largely wasted.\n- The action is often floaty.\n\nDespite its weaknesses, Brütal Legend pulls it off. It’s the ultimate tribute act, with metal in its soul and a heart as warm as a stage light. It may not have much in the way of polish, especially years after release, but it does have personality – not enough to hide its flaws, but plenty to temporarily bury them under a landslide of rock. I would definitely recommend Brutal Legend and i will give this game a 9/10 because the Weak Combat just didn't impress me that much but this game is FANTASTIC and definitely worth buying.","January 12, 2014","true","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Brutal Legend is a hack n slash, RTS, and Racing game all in one, and it works. You play as Eddie Riggs (Jack Black) a roadie who was sent "back in time" where humans are enslaved by demons and it is your job to free them, WITH METAL. No really, everything in this game is metal, the world, weapons, hell even Metal Legends like Ozzy Osbourne and Rob Halford are in it. The soundtrack (like it should be) is great, nothing beats killing demons while Painkiller is blasting in the background.

A huge part of this is the just awesome soundtrack along with an entertaining storyline.  Ozzie, Motley Crue, Megadeth, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, KISS, Anthrax, Motorhead, Tenacious D, and more.  On top of a linear storyline, there are a lot of optional side missions which are purely for tokens for upgrades to your car, weapons, car weapons.\n\nI am not done with the game yet but I have to say I love Jack Black and this game is a lot about him too.   His humor and characters speaks literally as you play the part of Eddie.\n\nThe game also has suprisingly tactical warcraft elements.  Besides the first person, hack and slash, car driving shoot and run over things you have storyline missions where you take tacticaly points, generate resources, train units, upgrade and move against the enemy.  While that occurs you also can drive, fly (I know, weird) or run around the battle field to help out in person or more manually control groups of units.\n\nA lot of elements from this game have been borrowed from other games, but it has been brought together in an entertaining story, action combo filled hack and slash.  All along with great music.  Highly recommended.\n\nA couple other notes, you can play the game on gently, normal, or brutal (I have only played on brutal) and with or without gore and profanity.","July 7, 2014","true","58.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think the writers did a good job of combining a great string of original ideas with classic heavy metal lore. Only downside is that the main story is a bit short for my taste (i must confess, i could not get enough of it), linear and the climax was a bit disappointing. They clearly tried too hard to set the story up for a sequel, which probably will never be developed.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fun, although a slightly repetitive. You basically have 3 kinds of missions: Hack'n'Slay-style main missions, exciting driving missions and the battlefield missions which were a great new idea, but didn't fulfill their potential despite being fun aswell. The optional side missions lack variety and proper incentive (besides some points to buy power-ups and clothes / car kits your really get nothing from them)... they could have done a better job including side missions into the story, like getting 4-5 minor storylines into the game. As I said, it's very linear. Some people may consider it a weak spot, but i think it's cool that you can choose to simply beat the bejeezus out of everyone with the standard moves or get and use all special moves to maximize your efficiency. I personally found the specials generally useless and there was no tactical aspect to the game... it's more of an arcade-style gameplay. Controls are ok on PC, but you clearly notice this game was made primarily for consoles and "dumbed down" for a broader audience. Too bad they failed at promoting it accordingly.\n\nGraphics are appropriate for their time and serve their purpose. Don't expect any fireworks... this game is about fun and originality, not cutting edge technology. The Soundtrack is absolutely fantastic and really helps you immerse into the game world. Voice acting is also tremendous with tons of cool guest appearances (i.e. Kyle Gass of Tenacious D and Lemmy from Motörhead). Level design is absolutely off the hook although you can beat the game by essentially giving your enemies the Diablo 2-barbarian-treatment  all the time (charge head-on - kill everything in sight with brute force - move on).\n\nBottom line: This game is a one-trick-pony, but that one trick is really really awesome. It's not worth a release-date pricetag, but a solid and fun game. If you want about 20-30 hours of straightforward fun and a short, yet entertaining story to fill some "time off" from the games you usually play, you'll have a good time with BL. If you are someone that prefers showing off his/her skills, looting/practicing for multiplayer games or spend hours getting every achievement, i recommend sticking to some MMORPG or FPS.","April 22, 2014","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Get this game as soon as possible. It's simply awesome. Hack and slash game with a main character voiced by Jack Black. Game revolves around heavy metal and a world intertwined with it after a freak "accident". The game is simply hilarious and that alone is worth it with all of its satire, caricature (see the headbangers in the screenshots, working in a mine, without tools, simply by using their thick, empty heads), and the like.

Brutal Legend is a hack n slash, RTS, and Racing game all in one, and it works. You play as Eddie Riggs (Jack Black) a roadie who was sent "back in time" where humans are enslaved by demons and it is your job to free them, WITH METAL. No really, everything in this game is metal, the world, weapons, hell even Metal Legends like Ozzy Osbourne and Rob Halford are in it. The soundtrack (like it should be) is great, nothing beats killing demons while Painkiller is blasting in the background. Story is alright but they really want you to explore to get everything, so if you just go through it without exploring you will miss a lot.

Black's dialogue and delivery is priceless as is the fantastic writing by Mr. Schafer himself. The PC version is more than 'just a port', looking and moving far superior to the console editions. The controls are fantastic, specifically with a gamepad. The only issue I have with the game, really, is that combat can be far too simplistic and frantic to be as fun as one might imagine it would be. Also, once the game introduces RTS elements in the form of squads and minions, it goes from 'true metal' to 'nu-metal' in terms enjoyment. That being said, there is a great story here with an enjoyable cast of characters and satirical achetypes. The game overall is great fun, and exploration and a joy. It's a shame that it couldn't decide if it was an adventure game, beat 'em up or a strategy game.","December 21, 2013","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The voice acting was exceptional all the way around, and the music is a solid sample from all over the genre.  The game took all of the outrageous sillyness in the basic concept is stride and embraced it in a way that had me smiling at the jokes rather than groaning.\n\nI lost a weekend to this game and enjoyed every minute of it.  It's a bit easy compared to other action titles, but the story is good enough that it doesn't matter.  This game is one of those that I wouldn't have been upset to pay full price for, so the current price is completely worth it.

Sure, Jack Black voicing the main character was fun to listen to, but everything in the game was just so wonderfully done aswell from beautiful bright and dark landscapes to even the little details of having rose bushes made out of rocker fists. I feel this game didn't get the credit it deserves around gamers. The only thing that I felt hindered my fun was the hunting questlines which were dry and only a little memorable because of Brian Posehn rocking a very cool NPC questgiver.

The first of the games two major draws is the amazing world Tim Schafer and co. created. You can screenshot the game at almost any moment and there will be something amazing on screen. The art design for the game is breathtaking esspecially for fans of heavy metal like myself. It's a world made from the stuff of album covers and it's well worth visiting.\n\nThe other major draw is the soundtrack. I remember when the game was being promoted they had a video of Tim Schafer solving a rubix cube before they could list all the names of the bands represented. To make things even sweet some of the members of those bands are in the voice cast for this game. Ozzy is particular has a wonderful role here. The songs are used throughout the game both while exploring the overworld through your car radio and to set the mood for missions in the game. I cant think of a single instance where a song felt out of place. In fact sometimes the music felt so right I couldnt help but grin from ear to ear.","March 12, 2014","true","47.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first of the games two major draws is the amazing world Tim Schafer and co. created. You can screenshot the game at almost any moment and there will be something amazing on screen. The art design for the game is breathtaking esspecially for fans of heavy metal like myself. It's a world made from the stuff of album covers and it's well worth visiting.\n\nThe other major draw is the soundtrack. I remember when the game was being promoted they had a video of Tim Schafer solving a rubix cube before they could list all the names of the bands represented. To make things even sweet some of the members of those bands are in the voice cast for this game. Ozzy is particular has a wonderful role here. The songs are used throughout the game both while exploring the overworld through your car radio and to set the mood for missions in the game. I cant think of a single instance where a song felt out of place. In fact sometimes the music felt so right I couldnt help but grin from ear to ear.","March 12, 2014","true","47.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game's big, dumb and ridiculous, and that's exactly where the joy in it lies.\n\nIt's easily accessible to just about anyone, controls are simplistic for the most part, but the RTS elements are a little challenging at first. The story in itself is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a videogame combining Jack Black and Metal, and it's a great laugh.\n\nThe locations, however, are what make the game really stand out. All the major locations are based on real-life album covers by famous bands, and even just driving around, along cliffs made of amplifiers, dodging giant swords sticking out the ground, makes you genuinely feel like you're inside an album.\n\nFurthermore, guest appearances by Ozzy and Lemmy! What can go wrong?\n\nA game specifically for fans of good old-fashioned heavy metal, with glorious locations, ridiculous action and a soundtrack that's simply perfect, definitely worth the cash.

The game really makes you believe that there was an age of metal (which would be awesome, though) with demons, titans, Ormagoden himself and humans. If anyone would take this seriously, it might even become a religion (or at least another evolution theory) for some.\n\nIt's amazing that this game has been released with all the good ideas, I'd really want to see a sequel to it with the ability to make Eddie fly when roaming all around the map, although it would be easier to find secrets that way. The limits of the map aren't natural when talking about exploring the game, though: you hit an invisible wall at some point, it feels like the map is made out of many open-sided boxes. But all of these improvements would work even better with separate campaigns for every main character: Eddie, normal/drowned Ophelia(s, spoilers, sorry), Doviculus, that glam hairstyle wearing Lionwhyte, maybe even Rignarok with Succoria, and the future characters, if any. Even though it's far fetched, it would make a great addition to the game. And, of course, a longer story - I've beaten this game in 8 hours straight. Must. Have. More.\n\nSo in short, the game is already epic, some improvements would work in favor of the game (unless it becomes worse like what happens with some game series - the writers get carried away), the story pulls you into the game and holds you tight until you ultimately finish the game with every achievement unlocked. The songs are picked pretty well, too. In the name of  every metalhead in the world, Tim Schafer, please release a sequel!","February 8, 2014","true","183.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dold/recommended/225260/","dold","dold","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dold/","234 products in account","First, I want to clarify my time played in Brutal Legend. The bulk of my playtime is from the Xbox 360 version, so while it looks like I haven't even beaten the tutorial, I did actually take a sick day when Brutal Legend came out on 360 many moons ago. I think I have played it about 1.5 times through.\n\nI like to think of Brutal Legend in two different minds: the Gamer, and the Heavy Metal Fanatic.\n\nThe actual game part of Brutal Legend is rough around the edges. There are a lot of Double Fine firsts here, such as multiplayer and Real Time Strategy elements. I found the RTS battles to be very unsatisfying. I usually just made as many troops as I could, sent them somewhere, and then went somewhere else to fight solo. There is a bit of strategy in what composition of units is optimal, but its very loose, so its not like you can make really bad mistakes.\n\nControlling Eddie Riggs is usually solid, as is the driving of the Druid Plow. There were times where I got a little crazy in the Plow and got stuck on some rocks and had to restart from a checkpoint, but generally I could drive wild all the time.\n\nAnd then there is the Heavy Metal Fanatic side to this game, where it absolutely blows away basically every game ever made. Every section of the game just feels like a classic album cover. It truly feels like a world that only exists in Heavy Metal. The soundtrack is absurdly good, and full of unusual tracks from familiar bands. As a lifelong fan of the genre, I still found some bands I had never heard before that I enjoyed. And the Druid Plow's roaring engine complements the songs very well. I spent a lot of time just crusing.\n\nPlenty of cameos are in the game, both apperance and voice, such as Ozzy and Lemmy. The script is usually quite good, but some of the jokes might fly over the heads of people who aren't as invested in Heavy Metal as I am. Most of the writing isn't like that, but it definitely takes a different tone when you know the source material they are pulling from.\n\nI would recommend this game to anybody who has any interest in Metal music. It was fun to hear music I had never heard before and enjoy it. Just treat Brutal Legend as a fantastic tribute to a rich and diverse music genre. Don't go in expecting to be blown away by game mechanics. It might get frustrating at times, but the sights and sounds are what makes this game one of my favorites.\n","February 19, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I feel this game didn't get the credit it deserves around gamers. The only thing that I felt hindered my fun was the hunting questlines which were dry and only a little memorable because of Brian Posehn rocking a very cool NPC questgiver.

Black's dialogue and delivery is priceless as is the fantastic writing by Mr. Schafer himself. The PC version is more than 'just a port', looking and moving far superior to the console editions. The controls are fantastic, specifically with a gamepad. The only issue I have with the game, really, is that combat can be far too simplistic and frantic to be as fun as one might imagine it would be. Also, once the game introduces RTS elements in the form of squads and minions, it goes from 'true metal' to 'nu-metal' in terms enjoyment. That being said, there is a great story here with an enjoyable cast of characters and satirical achetypes. The game overall is great fun, and exploration and a joy. It's a shame that it couldn't decide if it was an adventure game, beat 'em up or a strategy game.","December 21, 2013","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You start with a clear idean that this is an open world adventure game, only to be surprised (in a bad way) that it is actually an "action RTS", with a pretty rough control scheme and some "pointy edges" in the game design.\n\nIts flaws are impossible to ignore, but there is so much charm, and so much passion put into this game, that you almost forget they even exist. The idea is pioneer, to make a game homage to the rock n'roll, especifically the heavy metal culture. It is wonderful, you feel immersed in a sort of "Alice in Metal Land"and it feels amazing.\n\nThe voice acting and stars are also superb, with each cameo being better than the last one.\n\nMany of its good elements are rushed and could be fleshed out into something even more exciting, but don't let stop you from buying this game. Although you will have some trouble with the mouse and keyboard controls, and will face inevitable disapointment with your "open world adventure"expectations, this game is worth a shot for its concept alone!\n\nOverrall, I would rate it a 6.5/10, but don't get fooled: this game is a MUST for any metal fan, and a good deal for any gamer who enjoys clever humor and original experiences.

The story in itself is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a videogame combining Jack Black and Metal, and it's a great laugh.\n\nThe locations, however, are what make the game really stand out. All the major locations are based on real-life album covers by famous bands, and even just driving around, along cliffs made of amplifiers, dodging giant swords sticking out the ground, makes you genuinely feel like you're inside an album.\n\nFurthermore, guest appearances by Ozzy and Lemmy!

If you do not wish to read a long, detailed review, know this; Brutal Legend is absolutely brilliant. It has a good story, fast paced gameplay, which combines action and some Real-Time Strategy elements, is semi-open world (more on this later) and has the most rocking soundtrack of any game in living memory.\n\nSo, what do you get if you purchase Brutal Legend. Firstly, you will find a crisp video introduction featuring Jack Black, introducing you to a record of such rarity, he forgot where it is. When he stumble upon and opens it, you are presented with the best menu system in any game. It is quality, and marks the start of what will become a quality game. After starting the game, you are thrust into the main story. Make no mistake, this game is story driven. It will present you with the illusion of choice, but, really, there is little need to play many of the side quests except to earn Favour of the Gods points, which you can spend on upgrades to your car. The story is suitably epic. I will not spoil anything suffice to say that you are a Roadie for a modern tween-metal band, just getting on with your thing, thinking back to the glory days of metal, when an accident calls you to action. After the carnage has cleared, you awake in a new land, one in which you can harness the power of metal to slay the bad guys. After this, you are tasked with freeing a people, helping with an uprising and vanquishing the oppressors of this world. The characters are excellent, many voiced by prolific figures in rock and metal - Jack Black, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy, etc. Each character is designed to be the cliche, but this is no bad thing. It adds to the humour of the game.\nYour character, Eddie Riggs, is armed with a giant axe and a giant axe (this time of the guitar type). With one, you can bash the living daylights out of your opponents, with the other, you can call lightning strikes, small explosions or play solos. The solos are a great game dynamic. Use them to summon your car, raise relics that are used for varying purposes, or simply melt the faces off large groups of enemies. You also use them to capture fans in the RTS parts of the game.\nThis is where the game gets unique. Rather than simply bashing your way through hordes of enemies, you get presented with a battleground at various point in the game. You and your crew build a stage, as does the enemy. This is your base, if you will, and you must protect it. Geysers in the ground spew forth ghostly fans, which you have to capture to boost your fan points. These you can spend to upgrade your stage, your fighters and actually buy your units. The battles are fast paces and frantic, but very enjoyable, at least for a time. Luckilly, this part of the game is not overused. When it is used, it is in the right places, and builds tension. However, for me, there was perhaps one or two too many of these RTS bits. When the rest of the game tries hard to vary what it is doing, these are always a little bit samey, which is a shame. At least the setting changes each time.\nI completed the game in a single sitting or about 7 hours. I played some of the secondary missions, but not all - I am not a completionist. However, for completionists, you will be happy to know that the main story is only about 50% of the game - there is still plenty to do. For the age of the game, the graphics are amazing. It easily holds up with today's games, mainly due to the art style, which is phenominal. It really is a good looking game.\nOverall, I was thoroughly impressed. I bought the game a long time ago and never played it, but thought, "hey, I may as well give it a go". Thank goodness I did, as it is now one of my favourite games of all time. It is humourous, with its tounge firmly in its cheek, but hell does it rock. Buy this! Buy this now!!!!!!","October 8, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play as Eddie Riggs, voiced by and modeled to look like Jack Black, whos mission it is to liberate humanity from oppression.  The best word to describe this game is unique, the mesh of different gameplay styles and the manifestation of Heavy Metal into a video game really sets this game apart.\n\nPros: The coolest thing about this game is the Heavy Metal theme.  The world is literally Heavy Metal brought to life.  Trees are made of metal, spiders spin metal guitar strings, and giant engine parts strew the land.  The environment is well crafted and looks great.  The game has a good sense of humor and you will find yourself laughing at the characters and the situations that arise.  The story is decent and you can find things to do between story missions.\n\nCons: The first thing you will notice is that the combat is lacking.  It does not flow smoothly between enemies and the provided combos don't seem to do much.  Even though the Heavy Metal theme is the games best aspect, it is also a draw back.  If you do not like Heavy Metal, this game probably isn't for you.  All the music is metal and the characters embody all that is metal.  The mixing of action combat with strategy might be difficult for people to progress through the game.  The strategy portion is the most difficult aspect of the gameplay and requires more effort and planning.  For people who have experience in one genre but not the other, they will probably have a hard time.  That being said, the action combat is actually really easy.  Even playing on the hardest difficulty, I breezed through most of the game.  Lastly, the game is a little short, with the story lasting about 14 hours unless you are spending a lot time on side missions.\n\nConclusion: Brütal Legend is a unique experience that will keep you laughing at its quirkiness.  It's not a game for everyone, but if you like Heavy Metal and the idea of a world themed after it, you may enjoy this.  If you're looking for something with non-traditional gameplay and not expecting a masterpiece, give this a try.\n\nScore: 8.3 / 10","December 13, 2013","true","24.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game features stars like Jack Black and Ozzy Osbourne, absolutely kick-♥♥♥ soundtrack that can satisfy tastes of pretty much any true metal fan old and new (who said "nu"?), shines with great humour and takes place in a rich and creative open world that feels truly alive with real-time day and night cycle and variable weather.\nGameplay-wise it starts as an extremely fun slasher but halfway through turns itself into a somewhat hectic action-strategy which may turn many people off, but take your time to master its mechanics and you will find hours of entertainment within, which further extends into the game's multiplayer part.\nA must-have for every true metalhead regardless of their sub-genre preferences and just a fun open-world slasher / action-strategy game for everyone else.","July 6, 2013","true","64.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What made this a very good game for me was not the great voice acting, or the massive world, or all the side missions that bring depth and color to this game, the great world that was created, or even the beautiful Ophelia... What makes this amazing is the most beautiful compilation of Rock ever to grace any game, even surpassing Ukelele Hero. Brütal Legend is a MUST buy for any fans of Jack Black, good Rock or heavy metal and a somewhat ludicrous story mixed in with humor.\n\nPros: Story, world, characters, music, humor\n\nCons: Combat gets a bit dull after a while (mixing it up with combos and special attacks changes this obviously.)\n\n8/10","September 6, 2014","true","40.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you do not wish to read a long, detailed review, know this; Brutal Legend is absolutely brilliant. It has a good story, fast paced gameplay, which combines action and some Real-Time Strategy elements, is semi-open world (more on this later) and has the most rocking soundtrack of any game in living memory.\n\nSo, what do you get if you purchase Brutal Legend. Firstly, you will find a crisp video introduction featuring Jack Black, introducing you to a record of such rarity, he forgot where it is. When he stumble upon and opens it, you are presented with the best menu system in any game. It is quality, and marks the start of what will become a quality game. After starting the game, you are thrust into the main story. Make no mistake, this game is story driven. It will present you with the illusion of choice, but, really, there is little need to play many of the side quests except to earn Favour of the Gods points, which you can spend on upgrades to your car. The story is suitably epic. I will not spoil anything suffice to say that you are a Roadie for a modern tween-metal band, just getting on with your thing, thinking back to the glory days of metal, when an accident calls you to action. After the carnage has cleared, you awake in a new land, one in which you can harness the power of metal to slay the bad guys. After this, you are tasked with freeing a people, helping with an uprising and vanquishing the oppressors of this world. The characters are excellent, many voiced by prolific figures in rock and metal - Jack Black, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy, etc. Each character is designed to be the cliche, but this is no bad thing. It adds to the humour of the game.\nYour character, Eddie Riggs, is armed with a giant axe and a giant axe (this time of the guitar type). With one, you can bash the living daylights out of your opponents, with the other, you can call lightning strikes, small explosions or play solos. The solos are a great game dynamic. Use them to summon your car, raise relics that are used for varying purposes, or simply melt the faces off large groups of enemies. You also use them to capture fans in the RTS parts of the game.\nThis is where the game gets unique. Rather than simply bashing your way through hordes of enemies, you get presented with a battleground at various point in the game. You and your crew build a stage, as does the enemy. This is your base, if you will, and you must protect it. Geysers in the ground spew forth ghostly fans, which you have to capture to boost your fan points. These you can spend to upgrade your stage, your fighters and actually buy your units. The battles are fast paces and frantic, but very enjoyable, at least for a time. Luckilly, this part of the game is not overused. When it is used, it is in the right places, and builds tension. However, for me, there was perhaps one or two too many of these RTS bits. When the rest of the game tries hard to vary what it is doing, these are always a little bit samey, which is a shame. At least the setting changes each time.\nI completed the game in a single sitting or about 7 hours. I played some of the secondary missions, but not all - I am not a completionist. However, for completionists, you will be happy to know that the main story is only about 50% of the game - there is still plenty to do. For the age of the game, the graphics are amazing. It easily holds up with today's games, mainly due to the art style, which is phenominal. It really is a good looking game.\nOverall, I was thoroughly impressed. I bought the game a long time ago and never played it, but thought, "hey, I may as well give it a go". Thank goodness I did, as it is now one of my favourite games of all time. It is humourous, with its tounge firmly in its cheek, but hell does it rock. Buy this! Buy this now!!!!!!","October 8, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat could use a bit more work and its rather hard to order around individual unit groups.The world looks fantastic in the Heavy Metal theme.A Big thumbs up on the art style! I wish you could develop more with the other characters and well as their storylines.If you enjoy the world of leather,chains,bikes,sharp things,fire,skulls,Heavy Metal and demons.Brutal metal is for you!Buy the game even if you intend to just drive aound in the deuce exploring the beautiful metal world listening to metal tracks all day long!","February 11","true","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The cutscenes and characters are great as well. The gameplay is a bit generic but has a bunch of unlockables thrown around a somewhat boring map, which will keep you entertained enough as you drive pretty much everywhere. Obviously the theme of the game is Heavy Metal and there is a lot of that in there. Some of the cameos are painful, but having a wide library of music to play while you drive around is pretty cool.\n\nDuring the game, there are these really out of place RTS battles. It is a welcoming change of pace to the game, but gets really old really quick and seems shoehorned in. There is even a multiplayer version of it no one will play.\n\nRTS shoehorns aside, this game is pretty good. The gameplay is mediocre but the cutscenes and overall look and feel of the game really did it for me.","January 4, 2015","true","21.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Then here comes the gameplay, at first I thought that it's gonna be a hack and slash game but it turns out that it's not just that. In fact, I consider this game more of a strategy than an action game. The controls aren't that smooth but it'll do.\n\nIn conclusion, I enjoyed this game very much and think that you should try this game if you really love rock/metal song playing in the background.","February 6, 2015","true","12.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It was a weird hybrid of action adventure infused with RPG elements and RTS stage battles, tributing to metal music (actual metal music...) It was a mix-up of game genres that typically wouldn't work very well together. In Brutal Legend's case, the team at Double Fine pulled off a masterpiece. This game doesn't really have a place in any game genre, but it doesn't need to because it belongs into it's own category of weird quirky games what work exceptionally well. The first hour or so of the game, it seems like a typical action adventure open world game, until you get to doing your first stage battle... The game then becomes a hyperactive RTS for the battle sequences. Overall, this game is well worth the price, and it will be hard to put down once you step into the metal gods twisted and sickly awesome world.","March 7, 2013","true","17.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It can't seem to decide if it wants to be an open-world action-RPG, a real-time strategy game, or a driving simulator and due to that indecision none of those elements feel fully thought out or completed. The only thing that is thoroughly fleshed out is the Heavy Metal theme. There's sections that look like they were ripped right off of a Metal album cover, units that embody (or mock) fixtures of Metal culture, and a deep mythos that melds Norse mythology (the most Metal of all known mythologies) seamlessly with all that is Metal. Of all the shots Brutal Legend takes that just miss the mark, the commentary and the love of Metal is dead on. The game has the rare quality of producing lore that is instantly humorous but on a second look, is equally as capable of being taken seriously. That quality, and the fact the gameplay is switched up so often, makes it difficult to get too annoyed with its shortcomings. The familiar faces and voices of a couple stars in the world of Metal doesn't hurt either, even if they are overused to the point of parody.","April 30","true","42.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Darksiders 2 immediately comes to mind. This is still a fun game with pretty decent gameplay though. Being a fan of hardcore metal and deathcore, I despise the music in this game. I bought it for the gameplay though so it is tolerable. Jack Black does good voice work in this game and it is fun to run around killing things and doing missions. The graphics are below average but the game has good art design. Combat is a little janky but still works good enough. The game could have been optimized better as it gets a few stutters here and there but nothing that really detracts much from the core gameplay. Car handling pretty much blows. Controlling minions is easy and combat is pretty straight forward. The game may not have the depth or overall fun factor of much better third person action games but it doesn't take itself seriously it tries to have fun and crack a few jokes so it is decent for one play through.\n\n6/10 a good deal at $5 or less.","May 25, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The balance is just right, and the world you explore is amazing and detailed, giving you lots of opportunities when you are not progressing the main storyline to explore and take on side tasks if you desire. The game's hero is voiced by Jack Black and he brings his signature humor to the game, coupled with other celebrity appearances lending to the atmosphere of the game. Returning to the gameplay, the combat is almost single hero based with squad control, and basic single base RTS elements which it executes well (very intuitive with controller). The story is something I'd rather not spoil, but it is characteristic of Metal, and Metal themed media, that being said, even if you as the gamer are not a fan of the genre there is still a rich world and character interactions/story elements that are applicable to all aspects of music and a solid gameplay experience which should definitely keep you involved. The only place where this game falls short, and I'm not alone in this sentiment, is near the end (spoiler free review of course), it seems like the game was going to have a decisive third act but instead it was concluded on the second act. Nobody really knows the reasoning behind this aside from probably the development team, but it left gamers wanting more even though it did still basically wrap up all the loose ends of the story. Regardless this game is a full recommendation to fans of metal/rock no all music, and those who enjoy a good action rpg. It is an accessible, quality experience which will leave you with many fond memories of it. Embrace your inner metal-head and get this game.","September 5, 2014","true","19.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The actual combat is kinda-fun but still mostly brainless button-mashing. while the pseudo-RTS elements actually IS garbage and not an RTS at all. Driving is still pretty fun though, in a Halo/Borderlands kind of "Not really much benefit to it but still dang fun".\n\nBut it's everything else that really makes this game what it is! The music is bloody brilliant, the graphics and concept are close to "Lord Of The Rings, as written by stereotypical heavy metal fans" (aka: bloody awesome), and the voice acting and story is... good enough, I guess, I could never really judge voice acting.\n\nBasically, did you ever watch Army Of Darkness? Neither did I, I've only seen the trailer. But imagine what that movie would be like if it was just like the trailer, then make it 12 hours long, and you'll know whether you like this game or not.","June 29, 2013","true","8.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Some of the collectibles in the game reveal the world history in a cool way.\n+ Great voice talent and cameos.\n+ THE BEST SOUNDTRACK FOR ANY GAME EVAR.\n\n- Ok... the ending... it's one of those, "Thats it?" endings.  Big let down.  I would have preferred them going with some old videogame trope like "No, I am the actual big bad guy behind it all, and now you have to fight me" then you turn into Ormagodden (the god in that world) and fight.  I would have been all for that.  This ending just kind of tainted the game for me.\n- Its an open world game, and it suffers from open world game tropes like repetive missions, fetch quests, and hunting for collectibles\n- Repetitive voice-overs, "We're just marching around kicking ♥♥♥"\n- Like I said, the first 30 minutes are awesome, the rest of the game, the humor and pacing kind of fall flat.  I really feel like they could have done so much more with what they had here.\n- Some of the characters are under developed.\n- The vehicle controls are very brick-ish.  That being your primary mode of transportation for the entire game makes brick-ish handling unacceptable.\n- The pop-in.  I know this is a console port, but even with the draw distance maxed out, I still had things materializing right in front of me.  Its just kind of annoying.\n\nSo, with all this said, I am still recommending this game... only if you are a fan of the music genre.  Otherwise, stay away.","December 17, 2013","true","12.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Guess which side won.\nInitially, I'm somewhat glad that side was victorious. Brutal Legend is from what I've seen so far (little over half and hour) a third person hack-n-slash adventure game. The controls are simple and easy to pick up on but at the same time leave room to enhance one's skill with combos and strategy.  Graphics wise it leaves a tad to be admired, and the game has a fussy camera system which is especially prominent in the vehicle segments.\nI don't have any right to make a comment on the story yet, but I can say that the writing has a charming, casual approach to the brutal nature of the games world.\nThe game also features Jack Black (School of Rock, Kung-Fu Panda) as Eddie Riggs, while I'm not the biggest fan of Jack Black I honestly can't see anyone else filling in the role except for him.\nSo far, it's a pretty fun experience, it's rather obvious that it's been ported from the Playstation but that hardly gets in the way of the gameplay.\nFYI, these are my initial thoughts on the game, further into the game they may change.","March 3, 2013","true","10.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game's story is quite an interesting one and cameos from many well known metal figures are rather funny and/or interesting. All in all if you like metal music, just buy the game. You will enjoy many many things while enduring the cumbersome parts. \m/ If you don't like metal music, or if you're just indifferent to it, there is nothing for you here. Nearly every aspect of the game lacks polish and it's not worth going through all the shortcomings to enjoy the nice story.","January 31, 2014","true","18.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Also the game manages to mix open world action with some strategic grand scale battles with bosses. Graphics and art design are also Brütal and appealing to look at.\nProbably the only problem is that the AI sometimes plays it easy, while other times make it really hard for you, mostly on these strategic stage sessions. These battles therefore can be a little stiff sometimes and hard to beat. Issuing orders and keeping the battlefield together is also really hard in this view.\nThe side missions are fun, but after a while you will see that most of them are repeating quests and they are the same except for some.\nThe game is fairly long (around 12 hours) with (a my opinion) kinda lame ending. There is a multiplayer also, but without matchmaking, so you can pretty much just play with your friends.\n\nBrütal Legend is a rare gem in the action genre and a very fun game to play. I would definitely recommend to metal/rock fans, or even those who are just looking for some fine action.\n\n8/10 Awesome !","May 3, 2014","true","13.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Thegenre mashups do help keep the game feeling fresh as you near the end.\nPROS: soundtrack, Genre mashup, Jack Black humor, metal guest stars, seemless transitions\n\nCONS: Genre mashup, repetetive, slow parts may turn you off of the game\n\nClarification: Genre mashup can be good and bad, it is good because it keeps the game fresh, it is bad because the RTS sections, which are forced, are not that great.

Everything in the game is a celebration of all things rock and metal, and as such, it has a ton of great music in it and personality and charm oozes out of this game's pores. I was really pleasantly surprise when Double Fine put in the effort themselves to get this originally PS3/360-exclusive and EA-published game onto the PC, and then even Mac and Linux, when they originally had no plan to do so, much like how they went back and gave Psychonauts a new shine on PC/Mac. It's a good port of a good, straightforward game, and I don't think it sold very well during its initial release, so major kudos to Double Fine for believing in their game and expanding it to reach new audiences. I thoroughly enjoyed this open-world hack-n-slashy journey, including those somewhat strange RTS-like parts you may have heard about. A truly inspired and fun, unforgettable game with a lot of heart and a brilliant vision.","June 26, 2013","true","23.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That's basically what happens with Brutal Legends. You get sucked into a world full of trees made of car mufflers, spiders that spin steel bass strings instead of web, and a "Wailing Wall" made up of giant guitar amps instead of bricks and mortar.\nThe story is incredibly tongue-in-cheek and had me chuckling on several occasions. They poke fun of heavy metal throughout the game, but at the same time you can tell they have a deep love for it. It has great voice acting (Jack Black normally gets on my nerves but he's fine here), and an excellent soundtrack (assuming you can tolerate heavy metal).\n\nThe gameplay is your standard open-world character action game, but what sets it apart is the RTS element which is pretty divisive. Personally, I love it, and am surprised more people didn't get into it. They've spun it out into a full-fledged multiplayer mode with matchmaking, and I'm looking forward to digging into it even more. It does have a steep learning curve, but once you get the basics down there is a lot of fun to be had.\n\nDefinitely a game worth checking out if you haven't already.","December 13, 2014","true","17.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sure it doesnt do anything brilliant mechanically (although generally well executed) and the radial menu is finicky at best with a mouse but the rest of the game is pure gold. The enviroments are utterly gorgeous (very "metalized" e.g. everything is infused with stylized iconic heavy metal imagery)  The writing is mostly very well written and often hilarious. The stylized character models lend to expressive facial animations which add immense value to cutscenes. The RTS mechanic for major battles throughout the story is well executed albeit very basic for veterans of the RTS genre, but accessible for people who've never touched an RTS. And the soundtrack. The original game soundtrack is fantastic, add to that 100+ of the best metal songs ever made and you'll often find your head bobbing while you hack through demons.","November 2, 2014","true","14.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And sometimes even those great ideas are horribly executed. The game is a hybrid 3rd person action adventure with RTS elements with racing elements. Truth be told, I spent 3/4 of the game in Deuce, the beefed up car, mostly because the 3rd person combat and RTS elements are rather poorly executed. The game's story is quite an interesting one and cameos from many well known metal figures are rather funny and/or interesting. All in all if you like metal music, just buy the game. You will enjoy many many things while enduring the cumbersome parts. \m/ If you don't like metal music, or if you're just indifferent to it, there is nothing for you here.

He's hilarious. Surely the game has to be good.\n\nAnd it was, up until I met this strange lady who the main character wanted too hard. I spent 4 hours on this game. 3 of them were at one part. I'm going to say up front that I'm not the best at Guitar Hero, but I play fighters, so timing buttons isn't terribly difficult. But yet, there was something going on. During the Guitar Solo portion of the game, the first one, even that only requires 4 different inputs, one of which is given to you for free, the timing wasn't right. At least, it wasn't right visually. I didn't think of doing it by ear because the sound should match up with the picture, right?\n\nI don't know, but after look up stuff on the game, I didn't find many people with my issue, so I'm pretty sure it's got to be an issue with this computer. No big deal. It did make the game frustratingly unplayable, though. Oh, and the camera.\n\nDon't get me started on the camera.\n\nThen again, it could have just been visual lag again.\n\nI don't know.\n\nWhat I do know, though, is that the visual lag I had in this game made everything awful.

Some of the collectibles in the game reveal the world history in a cool way.\n+ Great voice talent and cameos.\n+ THE BEST SOUNDTRACK FOR ANY GAME EVAR.\n\n- Ok... the ending... it's one of those, "Thats it?" endings.  Big let down.  I would have preferred them going with some old videogame trope like "No, I am the actual big bad guy behind it all, and now you have to fight me" then you turn into Ormagodden (the god in that world) and fight.  I would have been all for that.  This ending just kind of tainted the game for me.\n- Its an open world game, and it suffers from open world game tropes like repetive missions, fetch quests, and hunting for collectibles\n- Repetitive voice-overs, "We're just marching around kicking ♥♥♥"\n- Like I said, the first 30 minutes are awesome, the rest of the game, the humor and pacing kind of fall flat.  I really feel like they could have done so much more with what they had here.\n- Some of the characters are under developed.\n- The vehicle controls are very brick-ish.  That being your primary mode of transportation for the entire game makes brick-ish handling unacceptable.\n- The pop-in.  I know this is a console port, but even with the draw distance maxed out, I still had things materializing right in front of me.

He's hilarious. Surely the game has to be good.\n\nAnd it was, up until I met this strange lady who the main character wanted too hard. I spent 4 hours on this game. 3 of them were at one part. I'm going to say up front that I'm not the best at Guitar Hero, but I play fighters, so timing buttons isn't terribly difficult. But yet, there was something going on. During the Guitar Solo portion of the game, the first one, even that only requires 4 different inputs, one of which is given to you for free, the timing wasn't right. At least, it wasn't right visually. I didn't think of doing it by ear because the sound should match up with the picture, right?\n\nI don't know, but after look up stuff on the game, I didn't find many people with my issue, so I'm pretty sure it's got to be an issue with this computer. No big deal. It did make the game frustratingly unplayable, though. Oh, and the camera.\n\nDon't get me started on the camera.\n\nThen again, it could have just been visual lag again.\n\nI don't know.\n\nWhat I do know, though, is that the visual lag I had in this game made everything awful. The car responded to my inputs noticeably slowly and that made the first escape the bridge sequence awful. Along with every other car-related portion of the game. Along with every portion of the game. :/","December 24, 2013","false","3.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

Soem it does better than others. If you are a fan of metal, speciafically classic metal (Black Sabath, Judas Priest) this game will speak to you. The action parts are smooth and the story line is decently knit together. There are some quests where you just feel you are on a fetch quest, yet most open world games have that feel at some point. Thegenre mashups do help keep the game feeling fresh as you near the end.\nPROS: soundtrack, Genre mashup, Jack Black humor, metal guest stars, seemless transitions\n\nCONS: Genre mashup, repetetive, slow parts may turn you off of the game\n\nClarification: Genre mashup can be good and bad, it is good because it keeps the game fresh, it is bad because the RTS sections, which are forced, are not that great. You can single handedly do most of them with out needing to even go into the unit build menus.","January 12, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story is fantastic and has some metal ledgends lending their likeness and voices. Ozzy, Lemmy, Rob Halford, Lita Ford also Tim Curry does an awesome voice for Doviculous. Jack Black was fully commited to his role of Eddie Riggs and really restored my faith in him. The whole world is based on metal album covers and looks great.

This game basically makes him the badass we all know he is, and lets you play that awesome character. The game is visually stunning, always picking the best view when you are idle. The soundtrack is BOSS, but, being Jack Black he made sure it would be.\n\nThe story, while a little bit cliche it would seem at times, is very entertaining and enjoyable. The combat however, is kind of repetetive at times to me, but still enjoyable with the mix of the guitar and the solos you can play. Jack Black playing the voice of the main character makes this game golden to me, and the suprise appearance of several other famous people makes it even better.\n\nOverall I give this a 9/10 and would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good time. The derpy multiplayer is the only thing I really don't like about the game.\n\n*EDIT*\nchange  "the badass we all know he can be if he wanted to"\nto "the badass we know he is"","August 17, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Is one of those games made by someone who enjoyed the medium it references and which grow in it. This is not a "let's push some random generic references to heavy metal" (as so many games have done before with the eighties), but a truly unique and well crafted journey through the perspective of actual metal fans of what the "Land of Metal" is.\n\nThus, if you know who Rob Halford is, or if you use (or used) to headbang with Ronnie James Dio, you will feel here at home, laugh with (almost) every joke and smile at every single reference, and really enjoy how the world of metal and some of its sub genres is represented, all glued together with one of the best licensed OST's lawyers and money can put together. You got no idea about classic heavy metal? Then lookup "Brütal Legend Soundtrack playlist" and choose the playlist with MORE THAN 100 LICENSED SONGS. Titanic effort to please your ears while riding through the land of metal.\n\nThe mandatory horns are here -> \m/, so we can keep going.\n\nThis is a classic Double fine game in what background and history refeers: Its ♥♥♥♥ing great. At every single level. Characters are funny and well developed (Voiced in the original version by people like Jack Black or Lemmy Kilmister), the artistic side of the game is impressive at almost every single level, with different zones of the map following different substyles of heavy music, huge creatures which seems to have just escaped from a Judas Priest cover roaming the land... visually everything is in its place and ready to rock, achieving a weird mixture between some of the best designs for both creatures and landscape I've seen, alsoo imbued with a classic spirit straight from the beginning of the eighties. Also, the (epic) history, filled with demons, vikings, gods of metal and a "as subtle as an atom bomb" reference to Motörhead would fit without problem in a conceptual album from Manowar or Dio.\n\nThe main problem with the game is that it tries to cover way too much features. You got a car which you can use to roam the Land of Metal listening to the different heavy metal songs mentioned earlier. You can fight with axe and guitar (yeah and guitar, HELL YEAH!) against multiple enemies. And you can direct battles in a simple-RTS style, in which it seems to be the main focus of the game. Everything can be upgraded, everything has combos, but almost nothing is deeply explored.\n\nYou never got to a smart designed melee fight past the first level, nor you get more activities than racing with your car, and the RTS battles aren't exactly food for fans of the genre, as most of them are really simple "go ahead with everyone until you destroy the enemy base" missions, something that, on the other hand, is to be grateful for as the RTS controls (designed to use a console pad) are improvable, if I had to be polite.\n\nThe crappy thing about all of this is that I'm not complaining about the game being bad (besides the poor RTS controls), but because I WANT MORE AND BETTER. The hack and slash deserves levels playing together with Ofelia (The female companion of the main character), the open world deserves to be bigger and more detailed, the RTS deserves to have proper mouse + keyboard controls so I can actually think on performing more complex strategies, like banding together with some infantry and attack in a mosh pit while a squad of bikers from hell cover our asses.\n\nI liked the game. A lot. I enjoyed every reference, listened to every song (Even discovered some groups that have gone under my radar), laughed at every joke and enjoyed a ride in a world I want to go back to. But I have serious doubts as if someone who wouldn't enjoy the background of the game would enjoy the gameplay itself, with its cool things, but also with its many flaws.","March 10, 2015","true","22.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Performance is great, controls are great, plenty of options to make it fit your PC. And at full HD with antialiasing, it looks so much better than the console version.\n\nOne thing you should know before playing: the game feels like a free-roaming sandbox at time, with side quests and exploration bonuses.

At times it feels like the world collide good enough to be enjoyable, but as a game it doesn't work as well as it should.\n\nThe Good:\n· Introduces gamers to metal and vice versa. If you're a fan of both, you will love this for sure.\n· Great voice acting, including Jack Black among others.\n· Creative environmental design...\n\nThe Bad:\n· ... but the world itself feels flat and empty. Everything metal-esque is squeezed together in a little enivorment or area, but everything around that feels like a flat world with some stones here and there. It's an open world that doesn't need to be there, but one that exists simply to boost the scale and to keep you busy while going from A to B.\n· Even though it's sweet to melt the faces of headbangers, the combat feels dull, repetetive and generally useless. There are basic axe-swinging attacks, then there's thunder and lightning to damage your enemies from a small distance. Besides that and some special guiter solo's, that's it.\n· The enemies have no health bar and neither do you. It feels like you're just mashing buttons to see which one of you drops dead first. Your screen will start flashing if you're nearing death, but by that time it's either too late for you to flee away and keep some distance for a few seconds to do it over again. Some people say the combat is difficult, but I say there isn't enough information given on your screen to know just what you're doing.\n· The story, albeit filled with iconic characters from the metal world, is dull and uninterresting. The familiar faces are the only reasons to sit through it until the very end.\n\nThe Ugly:\n· The game isn't very pretty, but good enough to do the job. Nothing too dated, nothing too superb, just okay. The character models and filled environments are a clever mix between fantasy and rock that helps to make Brütal Legend a little bit more interresting.\n\nFinal verdict:\nIf you're a metal fan and ejoy the occasional video game, definately get this. If you're the other way around, like myself, then don't. It's 75% metal and 25% game, and Double Fine should have taken another direction with Brütal Legend. It's bigger than it needs to be, but not figuratively big enough to fit in all the potential.\n5/10","February 24, 2014","false","6.7"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","16","32","0","0"

I want to love this game for the theme and the aesthetic, but it just doesn't play well. The biggest problem was controller lag - there's a small but serious delay between the time that I push a button, and the time that the game responds. I've found posts from several people who also suffered from controller lag, tried their solutions, but nothing worked for me. This takes most of the fun out of the action sequences. Unfortunately, even if I'd found a solution to the lag, I think the repetitive mini-quests were just too much. How many times can I enjoy beating up the same cloned goon squad? Several. More than one.But not nearly so many times as the game seems to require.\n\nOriginal review:\nThumbs up.\n\nIf you like Jack Black or Tenacious D, then you'll like this game. If not, then you probably won't.\n\nAs a fan of Tenacious D,  the style and theme of this game totally do it for me. Ever wanted to see what Rodin would do if he'd been a rocker? Then take a short hike to the guitar mountain overlook, where you can admire a gigantic slab of rock, sculpted by the Titans into the shape of pair of hands holding a guitar. Unfortunately, the gameplay is medicre, seemingly unfinished, with many of the missions being awkward or unclear. For example, there are several side-missions involving base-defense. The key to success is getting out in front of tne enemy. Unfortunately, despite cries of "the enemy is coming!" and "they're behind you!" the attacking forces are often hidden by the landscape until just before they reach your base, which means it's hard to see them in time. If there'd just been a HUD arrow, something to point out the direction of new attackers, these missions would have been far more fun.","June 25, 2014","false","13.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It's obvious that it was rushed.\n- The combat is shallow and boring.\n- There are two things to do in the world: gather collectibles and do side missions, and the side missions are bad.\n- We're on the PC, so why are we limited to console style RTS controls?\n\nFinal Thoughts/ Notes:\n- The ideal way to get the most out of this game is in multiplayer, granted if there are any people left playing it.\n- The game is too ambitious.

Because of their carelessness, Eddie ends up dieing on stage. As he dies, his blood awakens the almighty Metal Beast which takes him back in time into the Age Of Metal to fulfill his prophecy of saving humanity from slavery and demons, while teaching them how to harness the power of Metal.\n\nAll aspects of the game are fairly well done, suprisingly simple yet enjoyable (though this is not the most popular opinion). As you do missions, you unlock more combat moves, guitar solos (summon your car, buff friendlies, etc...), side missions (a good variety of them), vehicle customization (did someone say mounted machine guns?), etc...\n\nThere's a lot of collectables, hidden secrets, legends, and lore to be discovered. Lots of Metal references and Humor, you'll laugh a lot.\n\nThe game comes with full controller support as well, and is the recommended device for play.\n\nAnd the best thing about the game, the soundtrack, which you should check out for yourself ;) Have fun!\n\nAll in all, the best, if not perfect tribute to Rock 'n' Roll and Heavy Metal!","January 4","true","184.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/225260/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","TLDR – Brutal Legend is a third person hack / slash game with some simple rhythm elements and a sprawling single player campaign. There’s a lot of humor to be found, probably due to the lead character being played by comedian Jack Black. It’s also got a lot of foul language, so be warned if that kind of thing offends your sensibilities (you get the option to add censors).\n\nIn the story, you play Eddie Riggs, a heavy metal music “roadie” whose job it is to follow rock stars around fixing things and setting everything up to make the band look awesome while staying out of the spotlight himself. Through a mystical event, you are cast into the distant past (The Age of Metal) ruled by a demon named Doviculus, and inhabited mostly by monstrous creatures. The whole game has a heavy metal music theme, including rock concert battles, playing music to cast spells (kind of like songs in Ocarina of Time), and a lot of cameo appearances by famous rock musicians.\n\nMost of the gameplay is straightforward third person hack slash where you use your trusty axe and just swing until the enemy is dead (you can buy more special attacks later on). You also have a magic guitar to play songs for special effects, and as the story progresses you learn more and more songs to play. You also spend a lot of time driving around the open world in a car that you can summon (one of the first songs you learn). Like with most open world games, this means that the map is filled with optional missions and racing minigames, as well as artifacts that you can find for “fire tributes.” Fire tributes are the “money” of the game, and despite the game playing like an RPG, you don’t level up or get experience when fighting. You acquire the fire tributes and spend them on power ups and cosmetics for your character. One note that I’ll make is that a lot of the purchasable items are unlocked as the main story progresses, so don’t bother doing all the missions and hunting down collectibles too early in the game, since you won’t be able to buy much anyways until later on.\n\nPros:\n+Despite not having the greatest graphics, it is clear that the game developers spent a lot of time on the scenery and overall game world. The main characters may look cartoony, but the otherworldly environment is great. If you’ve played Just Cause 2, you should know what that’s like (gameplay graphics better than cutscene graphics). If you enjoy rock music, you’ll be in for a treat as well. Driving along with the soundtrack is pretty fun.\n+The game’s story is engaging and well written. Since the game world is so different from our own, the writers were free to come up with some interesting villains and history. Maybe you don’t like Jack Black’s style of comedy, but I thought it worked well with this particular game. He’s probably better known for childish humor/movies, but Brutal Legend has some mature themes.\n\nCons:\n-As with many games of this type (open-world) there are a huge number of collectibles to be found and if you’re like me you probably don’t want to go out of your way searching for them after the game’s story is over. It turns out that you won’t have enough money to buy all the upgrades unless you hunt down most of the collectibles. There’s no easy way to do it either, even with an online guide because the game’s world map is kind of weak.\n-One weird thing I noticed is that the game never actually tells you how to unlock some of these collectibles (using fire spells or thunder clap skills). I had to look it up online. This is a minor gripe though, since most collectibles just give you some fire tributes to spend. I was able to beat the game my first playthrough without buying much. The majority of purchasable items are cosmetic.\n\nOverall, if you liked action adventure games such as Darksiders, but thought they would be better with more humor and less hardcore fighting, you may enjoy Brutal Legend. The game doesn’t take itself seriously, and the silly ways that rock music is woven into the story/gameplay will likely bring an occasional smile to your face.\n","August 24, 2015","true","24.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is funny. And I like heavy metal quite much. Therefore, I really wanted to like this game.\n\nBUT the controls are untolerable, especially with the car. It's not just me. Every negative review on the Store page mentions the same problem: controls.\n\nI also find the camera distance and rotation problematic while driving the vehicles. Also, the game badly communicates the objectives or the means to achieve them. Only if you are doing something wrong for a while, a hint appears. Why not mention what and how to do something in the beginning? Why I have to keep guessing? Sometimes, I achieve victory right away, sometimes I need to try few more times. Either way I don't know what I did right or wrong. Things just happen in this game. The game has no mini-map, therefore I need to check the global map all the time. The game has no healthbar, therefore I don't know, how much health I've left. What's even worse: the game poorly communicates, whether you've received damage or gave damage. Also, it's hard to distinguish between friendly units and enemy units. For every friendly unit you have a matching enemy unit, who looks almost the same. The minor differences are noticeable only from a close distance. Also, the heavy emphasis on guitar solos doesn't make things any more convenient (you need to press a certain button combination during the solos and you are vulnerable to attacks for a few seconds before the solo is through).\n\nReal-time strategy, racing, adventure, hack-n-slash - this game has mixed so many elements, but none of them is done properly.\nThe game has a good soundtrack and story and that's about it. Everything else is just chaos happening between the cutscenes. Therefore, I cannot recommend this game. The gameplay is torment.\n\nBut I do recommend to watch the cutscenes on YouTube. If you perceive Brutal Legend as a cartoon, it's great, especially, if you know a bit about the history of metal and hard rock music.\n\nMy overall rating: 6/10","May 22","false","17.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Yeah, the gameplay isn't exactly stellar, and there's a good few bugs, but by the fiery breath of Ormagöden, this game still kicks äss on so many levels, it puts both Duke Nukem 3D, Doom 1 AND 2 as well as Serious Sam 1 to shame! The music is brilliantly chosen, and normally I focking despise Dragonforce for being the most ludicrously shïtty band to ever reach fame 'n' fortune in the world of rock and metal since cover-Metallica, but the way their tune played during that one scene in the game... I dunno. It struck a chord inside me. Yeah. I'm making music refs now. Deal with it.\n\nMoving on! The humour is in the usual Tim Schafer style, but with the added- yeah, I can't write this with a straight face, but the added "maturity" of it all (sexual references, profanity, shït like that), somehow makes it all the funnier. Sure, you can choose to bleep it out with censoring and shït, if you're a weak-äss little püssy! But seriously, hearing Jack Black cuzzin' out a dumbäss teen-band member for doing the Bobby Zilch dance on top of a flimsily built stage prop... golden.

The game play begins to suck. It's the uncomfortable blend of 3rd person view, guitar riffs & directing troops as an RTS that kills it. I just didn't want to be bothered with the larger battles, it's just a chore of dealing with the fact you need to be near troops to direct them, but you need to be in the air to get an overview, then you need to keep landing and playing riffs all the time. It probably sounds ok, but it just feels clunky and tedious to play.\n\nPress tab to do this, Q to do those, 1 to 4 to do those, F to fly and land, don't forget your mouse combo's in fights .. pfft.\n\nIt's difficulty is fairly low, so even with the tortured interface you will probably win the fights, but it somehow isn't fun.\n\nYou might like it, it's not horribly horrible, just annoyingly tedious. Maybe controller based folk find it easier. It's a pain on PC keyboard & mouse though.\n\nSad face. It started with such a lot of promise as well.","June 26, 2014","false","4.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has a fun story, characters and setting and if you can  get it cheap (I picked it up in a humble bundle) it's probably worth a play through. The problem is it's also a bit crap. It tries to be an epic hack and slash adventure, a driving game, an rts, and a teeny bit of rhythm game thrown in for good measure... and in the end it means that it does none of these things particularly well. The UI occasionally breaks and basic touches that would have made certain things so much more livable and which are present in their other games... just weren't there. If you just want to play through, it's a shortish varied game working on the basis that stuff is awesome and you should come along for the ride. If you're looking for something more in depth, there are better options out there.","May 22, 2013","false","40.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Get for a console, or avoid entirely.\n\nLong version: Brutal Legend is a well written game with a clever spin on the usual hero's journey story arc, with a self-aware sense of humor that makes even some of the failures funny. And that's the good news.\n\nBad news is that the gameplay itself is quite bad. First, you'd best have a controller, because Keyboard/mouse is basically impossible (Even the tutorial is for controller). Moving and attacking are sluggish, you fight the camera more than most enemies, trying to drive is a joke (and don't even think about racing), and the graphics will chuck often, even on a high-end PC.\n\nAnd here's the real kicker. It's unplayable on high-end PCs. There's a bug that crashes when the game clashes with many graphics cards, most of them fairly good. The fix seems to be to UNDERclock your card/system. Yeah, no. I shouldn't need to make my PC worse to play a game. And at this point, there's pretty much no chance of a bug fix for it.\n\nWith the bug aside, it's a mediocre game that deserved better than what it got. 6.5/10 for the writing and style, but major points lost for the gameplay itself. And then the bugs just add to it. Get it for a console if you really still want this game. The PC version is just another lazy port.","February 17, 2014","false","3.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
