Completing quests and killing creeps to level up your character. When you level up you will receive level up points (to place in melee, range stat etc) and I think after level 4 you will start to receive Talent points. This is when you can browse the talent trees and start to plan a path for your character.\n\nYou are not limited to any of the class talent trees, which is something I really love. Theory crafting your builds and trying new things that no on else has thought of before can be very rewarding and fun, even when you get it completely wrong! For new players, you are granted a free full respec, so do not worry if you go wrong on your first attempt.\n\nI am currently messing around with builds to try in the pvp battlegrounds, and have made a tanky ranger which I am having lots of fun playing at the moment... pewpew! :P\n\nOnce you level up and make a few friends you can start to tackle group dungeons, these dungeons reward relics which will allow you to buy the best armour sets available (at the dungeon level). If you prefer solo play, they have been adding "Story Mode" dungeons too. Here you can gain relics for those same armour sets, but story mode has slightly less loot than group dungeon(weapons etc).\n\nWhen you hit end game, you can group up and tackle the "Ascended" dungeons. These are buffed versions of the regular dungeons, much more difficult but much more rewarding! dropping better loot, and relics for the "Fabled Sets". When you are happy with your character and gear you can then start checking out pvp battlegrounds, world bosses, trolls that spawn randomly across the world.\n\nI do not really care for vanity, pets, mounts etc. but if you are a player who enjoys those things there are loads to collect! some are also only available when completing certain achievements. There are also tons of achievements too, if you enjoy those.\n\nIf you want to grind Gold, you can do that. If you want to hardcore level up you can do that too. If you want to bum around and chat with your friends you can do that. I have had loads of fun grouping up with people I met in the game, to run dungeons, pvp or just mess around, but I am at heart a player who prefers solo play... and I have enjoyed going off on my own adventures too.\n\nI think there are currently 16 professions you can work on, example: Prospecting, Farming, Cooking, Alchemy etc. My advice for these... is stay away from Fishing! damn that is boring, unless you like fishing (of course).\n\nThere are loads of quest to complete, and many players will find this the easiest way to level up early on. Once you get a grasp of the game, you can then decide what path is most fun for you.\n\nHope this was useful! Enjoy the game :)","November 6, 2014","true","121.4"," 253 of 282 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","253","282","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/varlun/recommended/298160/","varlun","Varlun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/varlun/","191 products in account","Alright, so after 14 hours of very enjoyable play, I've decided it's time to write a review.\n\nThis is going to be a fairly lengthy, very technical and detailed look at the game, from the perspective of an ex-Runescape player. If you played Runescape in the past, and are interested in nitty gritty mechanical details, then this review will be for you. I'm going to be comparing pretty much everything to how Runescape did things.\n\nTL;DR: Hands down recommended 100% to any ex-Runescape members. This game is overall absolutely fantastic, and I've just been filled with so much excitement and joy and nostalgia, on top of the fact that this game is better than Runescape in a lot of ways.\n\nRather than Runescape where you have all of your skills mixed up on one tab, here your skills are sorted between two tabs: Gathering and Crafting.\n\nFor Gathering, you have: Fishing, Skinning, Farming, Foraging, Forestry, Prospecting, and Crystal Cutting.\n\nFor Crafting, you have: Cooking, Leatherworking, Tailoring, Alchemy, Weaponsmithing, Armorsmithing, and Jewelry.\n\nThere is indeed a Skinning skill. Rather than RS where you kill a cow and it drops hide and a perfect little red and white steak, now you actually need a knife and can skin your animals, which will give you those, and skin as well. Very enjoyable difference.\n\nSmithing has been split up into Armorsmithing and Weaponsmithing. This makes sense and from a gameplay/economy perspective, promotes people to specialize in one or the other. I enjoy the change.\n\nForestry is Woodcutting. Prospecting is Mining which includes smelting, rather than RS where smelting was considered part of Smithing. Foraging is what it sounds like, all different kinds of gathering, from apples to various plants which are used in alchemy. In RS, Herbalism was a combination of gathering herbs and alchemy.\n\nThere is no general "Crafting" skill. It's all been split apart into different things, like Leatherworking and Tailoring and Jewelry and Crystal Cutting. It should be mentioned that getting crystals, or gems, is part of Prospecting.\n\nThere's quite a few skills missing, although missing isn't really an accurate word. Construction and player housing is really the only skill missed. Strength, Attack, Defense, Ranged, and Magic aren't part of the skills set. You can make fires, though I'm not sure which skill it's a part of, or if it's just a thing on its own. Fires can be used to cook and provide a small "rested xp" area like a tavern.\n\nPrayer, Constitution, Dungeoneering, and obviously Runecrafting are also not included.\n\nAlright, so now I'm going to focus on mining a little.\n\nFirst of all, the animation is different and how you get ore is different. In RS, when you mine a node, you play through a lengthy animation, and at any time during this animation you can get a piece of ore. If you get ore, the animation is interrupted. If you don't, it just loops again. The animation was that you'd first take 3 little picks at the rock with the point of your axe, then take a couple short swings, then a really long hefty swing.\n\nWith this game, you always take two short swings, and you always get ore after the two swings. Sometimes it's 1, in my experience it's almost always 2, sometimes you get 3, rarely you get 4. I'm not sure if this is influenced by level, it doesn't seem like it. I don't know if you can get more than 4.\n\nThis is an extremely enjoyable difference. It's more realistic, a LOT faster, and from an animation standpoint is just purely better.\n\nOn to crafting. Crafting overall, I really prefer how RS did it. RS was simpler. There are so many arbitrary ingredients thrown in to recipes, it's really annoying. For example, cooking. In order to make cooked meat, you have to have salt (which is bought) and basil (which is farmed). Why do I absolutely need these things in order to roast a slab of meat? Why can't I just make some unsalted, unseasoned meat? This is super frustrating coming from RS where you just toss the meat on a fire and call it good. In my opinion, you should have the option of adding salt. If you don't use salt, it should make regular "cooked meat". If you add salt, it should make "salted cooked meat" which would have better effects.\n\nAnyway, moving on to smelting. This is annoying too. In order to smelt copper ore, you need flux, and you need coal. Again, this is extremely annoying where in RS you just tossed the copper in. It makes sense to need flux, and it arguably makes sense to need coal to keep the furnace going, but needing a hunk of coal for every copper bar is just... frustrating.\n\nRandom note, while it's nice that ore and different things STACK in general, it is annoying that they stack to different amounts. Copper bars stack to 5, copper ore stacks to 10, coal stacks to 25, flux stacks to 50... etc. So when mining you need to figure things out like you need 5 stacks of copper ore for every stack of coal. (because the recipe for smelting copper ore needs 1 coal, 2 copper ore, 1 flux.)\n\nAlso, when mining you have a rare chance to get "pure copper ore". This is all well and good, but how this ore is used is a bit strange. The purpose of smelting regular copper is to get rid of impurities, and make it just copper, i.e. pure. So it makes no sense whatsoever for this "pure copper ore" to be used directly in crafting a superior piece of armor. The only difference between pure copper ore and a copper bar is that one is in the shape of a bar. They both get melted down and reshaped into the item anyway.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective I get it, you have a rare chance to get something that'll allow you to make something better. That's fine. But from a realism standpoint, it makes no sense. I think that instead you should have a chance to make a "pure copper bar", which you managed to get more pure than normal.\n\nA quick note about farming. It's pretty fun. I haven't done much of it, and I never really did it in Runescape, but I can tell you it's a lot faster and a lot more engaging. Rake the plot, plant the seeds, add water, and it starts growing. Growing takes about 30 seconds. While growing it can start to develop some kind of disease so you need to prune to stop the spread. The more disease, the less yield you'll get from harvest. I like this system a lot.\n\nI'm just going to start bullet pointing things because I'm running out of space.\n\nThe game isn't tile-based, you move exactly where you click, and can move using WASD and control the camera with RMB. It's pretty nice. You can also move by clicking on the minimap.\n\nThe pathing distance is extremely small. So you can't path around buildings or fences, it's really annoying. If you click on the ground off in the distance, it only registers out a very small way. The same applies to actions. If you right click to open a door or attack an enemy, your guy will run up to that distance, then stop and say he's out of range.\n\nYou can't set waypoints.\n\nIt has WoW's hippogryph-style travel system, except with dragons.\n\nThere are mounts.\n\nYou have a homestone, again like WoW's hearthstone.\n\nYou can't fly (mounts) or jump.\n\n---\n\nOverall, it does have its problems, but it just feels like a better, more modern Runescape.\n\nGive it a shot! You won't regret it.","November 9, 2014","true","62.7"," 115 of 129 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","115","129","2","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eldevinspirit/recommended/298160/","eldevinspirit","Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eldevinspirit/","2 products in account","This is a indie MMORPG that has been around 8 years in the making. It has launched in November 2013. For a small team of artists, programmers and developers, they have done an amazing job with the game.\n\nWhat I like about Eldevin:\n\nYou start off as your character - and Eldevin has a classless system, so you can choose/switch what class you'd like to be - from Warrior, Templar, Assassian, Ranger, Mage, Prophet or even a mixture. You gain talent points every time you level, and you can use those talent points in the tree of the class you wish to use. You also obtain points to increase your health, melee, mage, range etc.\n\nThe storyline is interesting, and some quests allow you to interact and some allow you to choose the outcome. There are also a few puzzles which is another bonus for me.\n\nAs long as you don't mind the graphics which kind of has a charming feel to the game itself.  There is alot of content to do, from training skills, to questing, to doing dungs with a team or by yourself (story mode).\n\nYou can also explore the world of Eldevin, complete achievements, and obtain pets/mounts/vanity.\n\nWhile exploring Eldevin, you can also use forms of "fast travel" from using a dragon handler to travel to a place but requires money, to using a homestone which allows you to teleport to the one city that it's attuned to - with a few hours limit - and to buy portals to summon a friend to where you are - to instant dragon which immediatly teleports you to a place of your choice (but requires eldevin points). And yes, Eldevin is that BIG.\n\nThis game is completley F2P. There are suscriptions available if you wish to recieve bonuses like earning more money/exp from quests/monsters that you kill.\n\nEldevin also has a shop where you can purchase things with Eldevin Points - purchased with real life money or even in-game if you swap gold for EP with other players.\n\nYou can buy mostly vanity/pets or you can also buy storage like sacks which helps carry your gathered/crafted resources. Fear not, if you can't buy sacks, there is a baby version known as baskets - which you can buy with in-game money - the only difference that it'll hold less.\n\nSame goes with backpacks (which gives you more inventory space).\n\nThere are other things you can buy like skill boosters (gives more exp in gathering/crafting skills).\n\nCombat:\n\nYou can use auto-attack feature to attack NPC's quickly, with the two basic abilities - melee and range.\n\nThere is also abilities that you can use, either purchased from a NPC shop for in-game money, or unlocked from the Talent Tree.\n\nSince it's classless, you are not restricted to one class, and can use abilities from other classes - like healing yourself.\n\nUsing abilities however uses MANA, so fortunatley there are ways to restore mana through potions/food or letting it restore itself.\n\nPVM:\n\nPVM can be found in dungs, ascended dungs (hardmode version) and world bosses as well as quest bosses.\n\nPVP:\n\nThere is an area where you can fight other players, gather useful loot, and even fight a world boss when it spawns. So be sure to look out for Trapper's Atoll aka the Wilderness. :)\n\nThere are also PVP modes you can do as well.\n\nOther Modes:\n\nThere are other modes then just dungs.\n\nYou can fight in the Eldevin Arena - facing against monsters in a team (not sure if its also solo), and fight in the Trail of Champions.\n\nSkills:\n\nThere are 14 skills in total, which 7 is gathering, and the rest is crafting.\n\nGathering:\n\nYou can gather items in many places/areas in Eldevin. Different resources spawn in different areas.\n\nCrafting:\n\nThe crafting system is a bit more in-depth, where you don't just need raw resources to make... mage gear as an example. You convert the raw resource and wool into cloth, then you use cloth/thread to make that gear.\n\nHowever, some gears are basic. There are gears which require more resources in order to make it. You can either buy those resources, or obtain them yourselves from doing Dailys and dungs.\n\nAnother example would be cooking. You don't just need fish, but also items gained from Farming/Foraging. Each type of food has a benefit for a certain class. It can also heal you/restore Mana - but can't use during combat. That's for potions made from the skill Alchemy.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n\nTypically you can level up by doing quests, but you can also grind on mobs to gain experience to level up - and sometimes that is only way you can level up and continue doing quests which requires certain levels to complete.\n\nSome quests can be boring, like kill that/obtain this for me, and bring it back. Those are usually side quests though.\n\nThere is no Guilds or Auction Houses yet but it's in the plans of the Hunted Cow Studio team, and thus the wait still continues :).\n\nHowever the postives outwiegh the negatives for me, because the team is willing to listen to feedback - and theres alot of content to enjoy in the game.\n\n>\n\nI would totally recommend this game to you, if you're looking for a new MMORPG to play.","November 8, 2014","true","319.4"," 57 of 64 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","57","64","6","0"

Game isn't making me more tired after few hours of play.\nWhile playing we aren't bound to any typical mmorpg class scheme. We've got 6 different talent class tables - we can spend the talent points ( earned upon lvling) any way we want to. Worth noting is that we can't make superhero skilled in every possible way either. We got to decide wether we want to deal with magics/meele/ranged and use them as our main force.\n\nNow onto the community, currently we're all waiting for the update adding guilds feature - but people start making small communities anyway. Character creater once is accessible on every currently online server (we've got separate ones for US, EU, Asia.. ). Everyone is friendly and helpful, game developers are very often updating the game in the evening (eu time) and playing the game itself also.\n\nAs a quality of the game I will add little story, that happened to me :\n"Some ranger was selling pretty nice 19lvl rare drop 2handed sword in world chat.\nThe sword's value was 10gold coins - that's pretty much for a early players like me.\nSeller understood I can not afford the sword yet and offered me this sword for a skinning activity - which took me about 10minutes to gather desired skins."\n\nForgot to mention - the game is developed by indie studio, they're doing great work there. I can recommend it not only for anyone who misses the old runescape times but anyone else interested in playing a well developed game.","November 22, 2014","true","60.4"," 60 of 70 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","60","70","4","5"

With leather, you can make Medium Armors.\nPlenty of dungeons to do, skills to train, money to farm, item sets to collect etc.\nLiked/always wanted to try out Runescape? Then this game is totally worth of trying out!\nReally enjoyable with a group of friends, especially if you have Melee/Tank, Ranged/DPS and Healer teammates for Dungeon runs. Or PvP (CTF or TDM)\nDefinitely "Thumbs Up" from me, even though there's Pay to Win elements.\n\nPros Events! Party hats! HATS!\nYou wont run out of things to do too quickly\nMultiple "currencies", smilar to Guild Wars 2\n14 Skills to train\nWorld feels really big. There's 5 "areas", if I remember right\nYou can pick up manure (its true)\nMounts and fast travelling (riding dragons, whoo!), so you dont have to go everywhere by foot!\nYou can get XP for your "overall" level without actually fighting. Just train skills, you'll get some extra XP (you wont get much, but hey, better than nothing)\nWont take much space on your hard drive. Barely anything, to be honest\nDoesnt need good PC to run - Has some FPS issues though. See below\nI almost got killed by small beetle, that was "only" 4 levels higher than me (is this good or bad thing?\nBosses are actually hard to solo (I am looking at you, Guild Wars 2) - assuming that you are equal/lower lvl than they are\nNeutral Its Runescape-like\n"Pay to win" ? I am not totally sure about this, but yep, you can buy many useful thing from the store with real money, such as (massive) extra inventory bags, various boost potions, etc. Spend few bucks, and you dont have to farm for money that much. I guess this is the price of the Free to Play game. They must get that money from somewhere, right? However everything (expect "Premium") can be obtained, as long as you have enough of Gold to trade for Eldevin Points (Premium currency)\nDaily quests - Both really nice and bad idea. You get Artisan Points (these are used to buy all kind of useful things) plus little cash and XP, when you complete those. The only problem is, that they're really boring and lame. Make/Get X amount of Y things. You can just run around the city, claiming your rewards from all daily tasks(once in a day, of course), if you've got those resources in your inventory\nNo Auction House - you must sell everything to stores or trade with players. However, they'll add this later though!\nNo Guilds - You'll have a hard time organizing huge player groups, since there's a player limit in Groups. However, like Auction House, they'll add this later as well\nI found 'tutorials' a little bit weird (skilling)\nMusic - I love it, but it gets repetive, since there's not that many different tracks\nCons Bots? I'd say that there's plenty of Bots in the starting place's Mine. That place is always crowded, no matter what time it is. Or prehaps everyone are just so excited about Armor/Weaponsmithing? Training enough of both (lets say, lvl 11 both of them?) takes a while, though\nSometimes you have to wait pretty long to do Dungeon runs. Waiting over 1h isnt fun. I cant say if this is problem only on EU server, or on other servers as well?\nYou do NOT want to do one quest at the time. Running back and forth - you'll just spend most of your time going from place A to B then. Try to do all quest in that area at once\nYou can buy in-game money(note; only the "main currency"), with real world money! - This is really stupid in my opinion, kids with their parent's credit cards/ people with extra dosh can get ridiculous amounts of in-game money, without actually doing anything. Expect "wasting" their money\nUh, graphics...? I am fine with them, but the character models, for example, looks pretty edgy-ish\nBarely any graphical settings. Only Resolution, Fullscreen on/off, capped FPS on/off, View\nDistance, Texture Filter, Anisotropy and Rendering, and "Enable Low Texture Resolution" thingy\nWorld is pretty empty. Too much emptiness, without real purpose\nRandom FPS drops - In City, you'll encounter FPS spikes. Mine swings between 4 and 50 FPS, which is really weird, since I can run at least Skyrim with maxed settings (and some graphics mods). This cant be so heavy game.... How to see FPS(without using any third party programs)? Just type /fps in chat\nClunky camera (controls) - Do NOT use WASD(movement keys) AND turn the camera at the same time. Camera randomly resets, ending you to suddenly change your direction. Hopefully they will fix this soon\nMost of the items (equipment) that you can buy from NPCs, are really expensive. I see no reason buying any weapons/armors from NPCs. Just make your own, do some Dungeon runs or trade with players\nDuring character creation, you have only few things you can change, such as face or body colour. Also, the characters are pretty ugly. But remember, this is only my opinion!\nI'll give it 4,20 Smuggled Strawberries out of 5.\n\n\nExtra; There was a nude gathering in the city. It was weird. They invited me in. Now I have weird friends.","November 24, 2014","true","182.1"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","45","52","7","1"

Mainly with half baked releases of content, such as a barely there guild system. Their development cycle for any content is massive and hunted cow studios interaction with the community is very limited.\n\nA lot of the player base left for numerous reasons and when they first released on steam their population increased due to curious people. This did not last and they rapidly lost the new people who checked the game out.  Getting dungeons on the small player base is very hard.  On average you are talking 100 odd players over 3 servers and they are mainly the hardcore holdouts that are left hoping. They use a lot of asset reskins to put out vanity. This game if you were to play, get to know the small pop and hope to find someone willing to let you tag along on dungeons.\n\nThey have also some solo dungeons, but mysteriously have stopped them after a certain point even though the population is not there.  For instance on other mmorpg games from what I have played, you have varied options to dungeon and find gear with smaller groups and decent gear. Here they limit your gem finding abilities and gear and almost make you feel ashamed you were forced to go solo. Then after a while you don't have the solo dungeon option as stated. Five man dungeons are the model really and at a certain point, you will need to try to get into them. The queue system is a no go, you can queue there for days, they will never fill. You need to find a group through people you know or chat hopefully.\n\nThe game could do with more listening to the community and a big injection of development staff and more content options.\n\nIf you look at the servers, us or eu, These are the ones to go too with a hand full usually online. The third server is empty virtually and just used for farming items.  Pvp island you can gather on. The pvp zone is pretty light on players, but will have a few who like to troll the gathers and kill them as they try to collect items here. I can only assume the island was so devoid of people the developers at one point decided to add nodes for crafters to come collect there to be targets to satisfy pvpers. You can gather outside of course in safe areas at a slower rate. But one can hazard a guess if so they wished why they want crafters on the pvp island.\n\nThe questing is pretty much standard. Kill x amount of creatures, hand in quest, get xp or item. Can you give this item to someone for me, you run off hand in. Can you kill x amount of this creature until they drop x amount of items so I can have them, go gather then return for xp. Stuff like that.\n\nUnless you made friends be prepared for the roadblock at the end as you need dungeons for end gear or I guess buy the materials.\n\nI think that covers most aspects of the game, I will briefly discuss the crafting, you basically gather or buy a rake of materials and take them to crafting stations plant character there and have them work away until the mats are gone. You either go gather more materials then or buy more.\n\nGuilds are bare bones and pvp maps limited and very few playing. No auction house either and it is almost 2016, really mind blowing to even have to type that. There is a subscription payment option also if you want faster exp gain etc and some eldevin points monthly. Check the hcs store for pricing.\n\nOn a finishing note if you do play. Gold will come easy later in game so do not panic. Eldevin is the currency you buy from other players or hunted cow studios and is far rarer. It is a paid for currency with very limited ways to get it, maybe at end game harvesting gems and selling them to other players for eldevin points. Dungeons give the most easy access to get gems. But you need those dungeon runs, some will get them, others not so muc.\n\nOverall, I will say this game should still be in beta and should never have been released for so long without basics in place. But it was released and I reviewed it as a finished product. They need to refocus as a dev team and get away from vanity releases and back to proper content. If you disagree with my review, feel free.  But it is my point of view and I ask you just respect that. It is my opinion. You can play or have played and feel differently.\n","December 29, 2015","false","283.1"," 44 of 60 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","44","60","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198031202883/recommended/298160/","76561198031202883","Strategy Player","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198031202883/","13 products in account","Here is my Eldevin Review.\nI can not recommend this game to anyone.\nIt is not even close to being finished, a lot of content that makes a mmo is not present.\nThe player base is extremely low, and mostly kids / students.  I mean players who are either still in grade school, high school or a few in college playing the game and doing homework at the same time. I tell this so that you know how the community is for the game.  In all the time I have been here and played on all 3 servers I only talked with one other player who is my age, over 30. Even if the game were populated by people my own age entirely I could in all fairness not recommend it. The current player base is toxic and because of the lack of content at max level / end game it appears that only bullies and thugs stay at max level 45 which I will cover in detail later on.  At best it is mmo lite, if you have never played a mmo in your life you might start here and learn the ropes.\n\nPVP – Most new players coming here ask about PVP.  PVP is dead, it is broken and virtually non existent in this game.  There is one small open PVP map in the game called Trappers Atoll, TA.  Here players can enter starting at level 15.  They have not tiered the map at all.  Max level 45 players freely roam this tiny map freely killing players who are 30 levels lower then they are.  It is pretty much the only thing a level 45 can do besides run the final dungeon again for fun at end game.\nThere are standard 4 on 4 PVP matches that last 10 minutes assuming you can find 8 people to join.  Again the matches are not tiered and you have a 15 and a 45 level in the same match.  Nothing about it I would call PVP.  Again, this is both true in the PVP map and the PVP matches.  Both of them are not tiered.  It is not just the bullying but having someone who played the game over a year with the best gear and best weapons and best gems in the same area as someone who played the game for 4 hours, come on really????????\n\nGraphics – The game is a browser game.  It is closest to Runescape with a tad better graphics. If you want eye candy for your new super charged machine look elsewhere.  I personally do not care about graphics, my first PC game was civ 1 by Sid Meirs in grade school to give you an example here.  I know that other people now a days do care.\n\nSound – Again same as graphics.\n\nCharacters – The game states to be classless.  I have found that it is really worse then having a fixed class.  All of your talents and spells and stats are based off of the primary weapon you will use throughout the game.  If you pick up a bow and start to use a bow you will only pick talents and spells that uses a bow.  If you want to say play a ranger and use bows and swords you will be out of luck. Then there is the 2-hand weapon guy, the 2 1-hand weapon guy, the 1-hand sword and shield guy and finally your mage.\nThere is not really much variety here, level 45 player builds all look the same with no variety.\n\nCrafting / Professions there are 14 and you can learn any of them and max them out at level 45.\nPlease note that currently there is no mailbox or auction house and the populaton on servers drops down to as low as 30 during slow periods of the night.  So if you are thinking of crafting or gathering to raise gold it it pretty much pointless at this time.\n\nQuests – The standard go fetch x items, go talk to this npc here, run around the map back and forth.  Again nothing new here.  I got really tired of the run from this city to the other city, talk to a NPC then run back.  Only to find that as soon as you complete that quest the same NPC has you run to the same city you just came from to talk to another NPC 2 feet away.\n\nPay to Win – Not really.  The only bad downside is the fact that there are things here to buy with real cash that are not available for a free to play player.  The worse example is the backpack.  A free to play player can buy and upgrade bags costing thousands of gold pieces for a normal bag each.  A backpack, which holds about twice or three times the best bag a free to play player still costs over $15 in real money to buy.  Also note that you can have multiple bags in both your inventory and in the bank.  There is also no way to extract / upgrade gems except for using real money.  So keep in mind if you put a gem in a slot it will cost real money if you want to use it later on or upgrade it to the next level. There is a cap on gold for free to play players and with a subscription it is removed.  Also a subscriber earns 2x as many relics when running a dungeon so they get the best gear twice as fast.\nFinally a subscriber will earn an extra 25% more gold from loot drops and when they sell items to a vendor.\n\nLoyalty program – What a joke.  You earn 5 tokens a day when you log in.  Then you can turn these points in for free stuff.  Let me give you an example of what they want to reward you with.  For 10 loyalty tokens you can buy a little bit of copper.  Copper is the first metal you can mine in the game, it is found all over the entire map and the amount you get for free you can mine in less then 1 minute on the map.  If the intention is to keep players coming back to play they failed miserably here.\n\nDungeons – You get a new dungeon every 5 levels except for level 30.  The best gear and loot drops from them.  They have opened a can of worms here as well.  There are 2 ways to run a dungeon.  If you have a full party of 5 you can run the dungeon in dungeon mode like a standard mmo dungeon.  However, they also have a story mode where as little as 1 player can enter and do the same dungeon with the monsters being 1/5 health and fewer of them and the loot drop greatly reduced. So now it is almost impossible to get a full dungeon party together because at any time a single player can just run through the dungeon and not have to wait.  You also have a few problems with groups of 5 players speed running the dungeons in story mode to just farm the bosses for relics getting the best gear that way.  There is also a loot system where players can pass, greed or need items that drop.  This creates all sorts of head aches as some players will need on everything and have a better chance to win the loot rolls and they get kicked out quick.\nAnother problem with story mode is players never learn how to play and run dungeons with other players.  At end game and the hardest dungeons, where team work is key to victory, these players have no clue how to work together.\n\nMounts – Yes they have horses and other things to ride here.  As soon as you have 6 gold you can buy the first level ride skill for 5 gold and a flying disc for 1 gold.\n\nThere is no mail system or auction house in game.  It may or may not be coming sometime in the future.  This means the only way to trade items is to spam world chat and hope that the one player who may buy/sell you something is on at the same time you are.  It makes crafting and gathering to make gold rather pointless since chances are pretty good no one on will be buying that one thing.\nThis is kind of hard to do when the player base drops to as low as 30 players actually online during the slow periods of the night. The highest I have seen on at one time during my time here is 800 on a weekend during the christmas break when all of the students were out of school.  I understand that the staff is tiny they have more games to support then developers currently.  It is easy to check how many players are on.  Just type /who in chat line and it gives you the number.\n\nI tired to cover everything you might want to learn about the game before playing it yourself.\nAt this time of writing I put in just over 400 game hours, my character was max level, all of my quests were done and I have run all dungeons at least once.  Now I choose to leave instead of going to TA and killing brand new players so hopefully some of them will stay past level 15 and play the game.","January 23, 2015","false","424.5"," 44 of 61 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","44","61","3","24"

I played World of Warcraft for years and Eldevin ranks right along with it. The one thing missing is a Auction House. The rest is there including Mailboxes!! The only downside to the mail system is that it requires Eldevin Points to send items. The Points can be purchased or IF you have an item that other players want you can trade them for the points. Most of the players are friendly and will help you out. (Total Strangers Helping you out really!!) The story lines are really easy to understand and you can do most everything by yourself IE: Dungs. These have an option that you can run the Dung on "Story Mode" and you can solo them but make and take lots of healing pots, mana pots etc..Storage is an issue and you will soon see the need for Bags. These you can either buy from other players or from the game store "They cant be made". You can however gather many items and make things yourself such as weapons, armor, potions, and even mounts. I do however recommend you stay out of the PvP areas until you are leveled and geared for it because most of the chars in this area are maxed in lvl and gear. I LOVE IT!!! Eat your heart out WoW!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chadwick9000/recommended/298160/","Chadwick9000","Vos futuo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chadwick9000/","84 products in account","You might have noticed that this review is long. Very long. Before you start reading the next one, I have a TL;DR and Pros and Cons for if you're too lazy to read the whole thing:\n\nTL;DR: I wouldn't rate this game very high. A 7/10 at most. Still, it's fun if the few cons don't bother you.\n\nPro:\n- A very nice storyline. Maybe not very original, but definitely engaging.\n- Not a lot of paid content. Most content is accessible without having to pay real money.\n- Very large world.\n- A bunch of cool dungeons that you can beat solo as well as in a group.\n- A lot of the armour looks really cool and original.\n- The UI looks very good.\n\nCon:\n- A bit unoriginal as an MMO.\n- A lot of (mostly vanity) items are very, VERY expensive, either in real life or ingame currency.\n- Armour can not be worn as vanity. No matter how cool it looks, once its outdated you can't show it off anymore.\n- At least in my opinion, the look of the game is not very good. The graphics seem old and the aesthetics are nothing great either.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEldevin. Your average MMO, to be honest. It doesn't really have a lot to separate it from the crowd; This being both a good and a bad thing.\nFor example, if you're used to other MMOs, it's probably very easy to get in to. But on the other side, why would you, since it's not very different from said MMOs? Well, it of course has *some* elements that most others don't have. For one, the percentage of content you have to pay for to be able to use is very low. The little bit of paid content it does have is also mostly (if not all) vanity stuff, and no entire areas of the map that you have to pay $29,99 for to unlock. So, there's that for a difference with most other MMOs.\n\nThe world is very large, but most of it isn't accessible until you're a higher level. Well, it is accessible of course, but not recommended. Most mobs are aggressive, so it's difficult to survive in higher leveled areas.\n\nThe different skills, talents and classes allow for a bunch of different play styles, but quests and sometimes even the storyline will force you to use specific skills and thus upgrade them even if you wouldn't really need them except for those few quests.\n\nThere's a bunch of 'group instances' throughout the game. They all have their own loot, which includes cool-looking armour sets, weapons, etc. They can be beat in Story Mode (single player, no loot gotten, mainly for quickly doing story quests) and Group Mode (multiplayer, loot divided between group members, all mobs get buffs to be challenging for 5-player groups).\n\nI've seen some complaints about the look of the game and yeah, I agree. The graphics look old to me. While without a doubt some like it, I think it makes the game look outdated. Nor the characters nor the terrain have much detail, and just look like something your average game in 2003 could best. The aesthetics aren't great either. The characters move a bit rigid (which is something we see a lot, though). Of course this is understandable because Eldevin isn't some big super blockbuster AAA 300 million dollar game but still. The UI looks good, though. With a lot of small games you see that the UI is just a bunch of grey, half-transparent squares with numbers or text in Times New Roman, but the UI in Eldevin looks very nice.\n\nThere's maybe not very many different vanity items compared to other games that have just been out for much longer, but there's enough to make each player that has invested some time in the game look different from eachother. A lot of the vanity is (once again) very, very expensive. Either in the sense that it costs a lot of real life money (not very common in this game but it happens) or a lot of ingame money. For example the vanity bought with Prestige Points. Prestige Points are earned by doing some daily quests around the game. Players who have 'just' started playing will get 4 per day at most, more experienced players will get around 10 if they do their best. During Christmas you can get much more (>100 per day is possible, but you'll have to grind christmas mobs for hours). Even then, they're SO EXPENSIVE. One vanity set costs (I think) 50,000 prestige points. I might be horribly wrong, but at this scale, it doesn't matter much. That's why the costs of most vanity items are my main (but almost my only) complaint.\nI could name more examples and rant about it for hours but I'm already writing a bit too much. So yeah.","December 27, 2014","true","52.9"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","28","35","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beefjerkythegamer/recommended/298160/","beefjerkythegamer","BeefJerky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beefjerkythegamer/","49 products in account","Amazing Experience!\nThis game is great, and I've thoroughly enjoyed my experienc thusfar and will continue to play hopefully for a long while.\n\nFirst of all, this game hits that nostalgia factor, as at times it can feel somewhat like runescape. This is mostly due to the different skills and professions you can get yourself into, such as mining, making weapons, leatherwork, cooking, fishing, jewlery making, and much more. It feels nostalgic and rewarding to level up skills that tie in with your play style in order to provide for yourself and sell/supply to others.\n\n_________________________________\n--Overview--\nPros:\nIn-Depth storyline\nMany skills/professions to become skilled in\nGreat community\nEnjoyable sidequests\nDiverse world\nGreat for playing in a group\nCons:\nDwindling playerbase\nOutdated graphics (Not a con for me personally, as I find the grapics charming, though many people want better graphics._______________________________\n\nPremium CurrenciesA big point I like to make about this game is the fact that it does have a premium currency, though it is only for vanity items and special weapons. Throughout the game you will never have premium items shoved in your face unless you choose to visit the shop yourself to see what there is.\n\nQuesting/ObjectivesQuesting can be fun and rewarding in this game as well. There is an in-depth main storyline which can lead to side-quests, but there are also tons of npc's around the world to get tasks from. In addition, there are quests to start you off in various skills, such as learning how to make weapons from ore, tailor clothes, farm a successful garden, or brew your own potions. The quests can lead you to new, interesting areas, and the big quests involve some depth and are not ridden with fetch objectives. All in all, I've enjoyed most of the quests, and the npc's who give them to you have character and are interesting to interact with.\n\nThe WorldThe world itself isn't the largest, though it is diverse and it is more expansive than I originally thought when starting out at the beginning of the game. Some quests lead you to  new regions outside the map of the main city and wilderness, but you can find cool areas simply by exploring. Be weary, though, and possibly bring a friend, for you may run into particularly aggressive high-level creatures during your ventures. Throughout the world, characters have connections between areas, and the general feel of the game is prevelant with npc's of different regions.\n\nGroup/Party PlayPlaying with a group is great. A couple of my friends and I decided to start this game together, and have chosen to focus on certain roles individually (I level up mining and weapon/armor crafting as well as being a melee warrior, one of us is an archer and levels in alchemy for potions, and another is our mage, leveling in magic with focus on healing and supplies us with food and charms). This system works great, as certain quests will lead you to group bosses, or raids, and it is a good idea to have backup on different roles. Also, you get an XP boost and can complete objectives simoultaneously to finish quests faster (defeating x/x enemies counts up together so you don't have to do it twice).\n\nCommunityThe community is great as far as I can tell. Starting out a random guy gave me a couple premium currency for free in a trade, which I was greatful of, and me and another similarly leveled player focused on different tasks (me mining, him farming) and exchanged goods to help each other out after randomly meeting. The only thing detrimental is the fact that the amount of players playing this game is dwidling. I hope people in the community can help to kindle a bigger playerbase, because with more players there will be more opportunity to trade and sell services to one another which would make the whole game experience even better.\n\nFinal VerdictOverall this game is awesome. I've enjoyed grinding skills that I'm interested to supply my friends with better gear and sell to other players. The quests are enjoyable and the storyline has depth, so the whole experience can be quite immersive at times. There is opportunity to build your character whichever way you want, and group play adds to the experience. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes games like runescape as well as people who like fulfilling questlines or are just looking for a good f2p mmo.","November 16, 2015","true","25.3"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","29","37","0","0"

It has all the elements you'd expect in an RPG, and it's built to run in a web browser too! A lot of reviews reference to Runescape, and yes I can see how you might compare the game to it, but being in a browser is probably the closest reason for that comparison. This game has plenty of unique features that will keep you busy.\n\nLots of solo and co-op content, in fact the dungeons even come with a "story" mode, if you prefer to play alone. The monsters are easier, and you don't need a bunch of buddies to take the dungeon. However, if you want a challenge, run the dungeon normally and get the full experience.\n\nLots of crafts to keep you busy, piles of quests and content, and a diverse user-built class system, which you can change with a free respec every 60 days if you decide to. Fun PVP zones, arena challenges, seasonal events, lots going on in the game to keep your interest.\n\nThere is of course a pay for shop, but its not required to enjoy the game. The subscription benefits are nice, but only reduce the grind if you feel the need. The game progresses at a steady rate even without the buff. I've only been playing about a week now, but I see myself sticking to it for quite awhile. Will update my review as I go.\n\nWhat have you got to lose? Its free, give it a try!

I won't go into details, because even though it has similarity, its still diffrent.\nIf you've played runescape and got bored by all the VIP only features, check Eldevin out.\n\n>Team Players\nEldevin doesn't have a massive player base. So I recommend to grab a few friends for the start.\n\n>Complaints about Inventory space\nI've seen many people complaining how Backpack space is way to expensive and you have not enough space for your items. Which is not really true. I did buy the DLC's shich contains bigger backpacks, but it's not necessary. If you clean up your inventory and save up some gold for Baskets there should be no problem.\n\n>Pay2Win?\nNot at all, you can simply buy cosmetics in the shop. And later on, getting Gold is so easy that you don't even have to buy cosmetics for actual money. The ingame currency is stable at Gold:EldevinPoints(EP) 3:1\nImportant: If you decided to buy EldevinPoints, DO NOT buy gold from the Shop.\n\n>My overall playtime\nCompared to other MMO RPG's my playtime is quite much. It's very fun to play with friends and Guild Members, specially if there's an event active.\n\n>Events / Updates\nThe game has for every international holiday an event ready. Sometimes they have bigger updates and fixes. Whenever an event goes online, there are quite a few bugs and glitches, where you can't finish your event quest. But thats no big deal since the devs fix it right away - 1 day.\n\n>I read your review, I still don't know if I should try it\nTry it. It's free. The only thing that could happen is, that you buy Eldevinpoints at the very beginning and realize that you don't like the game. But I don't think people are that stupid anyways.

I do not enjoy MMOs or their communities. Most of the time, if a game is listed as MMO I avoid it, and the MMOs I do try I get around 5-to-6 hours in before calling it quits... This game broke that. It's not what one would call "pretty", but its humor and storytelling more than make up for that. The mechanics are solid, with an incredibly immersive world that never seems to wind down. There's never a true calm period, as you always see people in a mad rush (at least, in the opening areas; I'll touch on that more when I get pass the Copper-age). The story and plot are cliched, but the way they are portrayed make such a huge difference, and the fact that some portions of the story can be different from anothers by simply choice add so much to replayability and roleplay, as well as gives everyone a potentially different story to swap and love.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for that one retro-feel game that can really cure that itch for an MMO, this is probably the one.

I will try to keep this as short as possible while still maintaining all the necessary information. I do not normally write reviews so bare with me on this. There is a reason I am choosing to write this review which you will see towards the end.\n\nNow, let's begin with the game itself.\n\nThis game has been out for just barely more than a year. The staff behind this game have done an absolutely incredible job with quests, with the story line and overall game play.  Sure, there's some little buggy issues here and there, but it's an indie game that hasn't been out long. To expect perfection would be pretty ludicrous. Even EA puts out ♥♥♥♥ games and they're a billion dollar corporation.\n\nJust like any MMORPG you have the basic classes and subclasses to character creation. Archer, Mage, Healer, Tank and then the subclasses like assassin, warrior ect. This system is pretty much universal but everyone has their own unique ways of doing it. I want to avoid comparing this to runescape, I know this is what everyone is doing. However the ONE thing I will say, is if you are looking for a runescape like game, this is your game.\n\nThe resource gathering on this game and the profession leveling can be a very painful grind at times. The Community in game is fantastic. You get the occasional jerks that just want to start ♥♥♥♥, but most everyone is very helpful and supportive.\n\nThe world... even now after 250 hours of game play on this game, I am finding places in this game I didn't even know existed. There's so much to explore, so much to do, there's an insane amount of side quests and story line quests.\n\nMost importantly however, is the admin/customer support staff. There is none like this out there. You will not find a friendlier group of guys out there. If you have a problem and need a quick fix, find an online admin, or submit a ticket. Fast response times Monday through Friday and they legitimately seek to help you. The staff is what prompted me to write this review. I could not give this staff enough praise even if I wanted to. If they had the resources as a company like EA, Activision, SEGA, ect, the would would be the limit for these guys.\n\nI WANT to rate this game based on potential. For a free to play, pay for benefits game, this game is incredible. It's not a pay to win game by any means. If I were to rate based on potential due to how young of a game this is, I would say 9/10. This game has that kind of potential.\n\nHowever, to give this game a rating as it stands, I would give this game a 7/10. As much praise as I give this game, the only 2 complaints I have about it to drop it from an 8 to a 7 are the fact that the leveling really, really feels like a grind at times and there is somewhat of a lack of customization of armor/weapons. This may get fixed in the future though. There's just a slight lack of weapons/armor content is all.","January 14, 2015","true","343.2"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","22","29","0","0"

Most of the materials stack to 5 or maybe 10 before taking up another 'slot', and you've also got to carry around a pickaxe, shears, an axe, a fishing rod...whatever.  If you want to actually experience the crafting, prepare to shell out some cash to even have room to do anything.  I spent more time reorganising my inventory (or running allll the way back to the bank and/or vendors) than I did anything else.  A shame, really, because it has a lot of potential.","December 6, 2014","false","2.6"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","22","30","0","0"

This game delivers on everything that you would hope when reminiscing about the past. All the skills are amazing. The combat is great as it introduces more ways to fight then just stand their and watch your character attack.

Since its free to play there's nothing wrong with trying it out to see for yourself.\n\nThis is kind of like runescape meets V-wow, its somewhere in the middle. Ten times better than runescape, but probably about a quarter of the players.\n\nIts tons of fun to go do quests and stuff, not a ton of players though, but that's to be expected honestly. Its only been really out for about a month and from what i heard it wasn't easily playable at first, but that's changed considerably.\n\nHowever, the interface still needs work butI rarely run into bugs. No jumping kind of is disconcerting not only that but there's a lot of other things that I'd like to more or less be updated to fit more modern games. One big thing was that objects are sometimes larger than they appear annd you more or less have to click a point for your character to move around the object, which is a big thing i run into a lot, camera controls and how everything is put together is a bit condense, espically in some areas where you have to be looking almost straight down to be able to move around properly. But over all its a ton of fun for what it is. Graphics aren't bad, but not excatly the best either. Zones are also kind of weird, I like the idea of being able to run about and get killed by high level mobs. Also pvp was more or less an after thought. All levels are thrown into the arena, while lower levels gets a boost it just shows there aren't enough players pvp'ing to do anything great with it, also there's no real pvp armor or anything like that meaning the system is nearly pointless other than getting a mount and some top layers to cover your armor. Also no player aution house means only venders are there for selling or going out and asking people to trade, which since your voice only really has a limited reach it will get very hard to sell something to other players.\n\nNow while that might push some away, this is still an amazing game. It has a ton of room to grow and they are planning on expanding it considerbly.","December 8, 2014","true","204.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I like how there's so many different gathering and crafting skills, and that you can do every one of them on one character, I find it enjoyable just to go on gathering trips and then come back and sort what I have for crafting, which is VERY unlike me, typically.\n\nSure, the graphics are not modern and snazzy, but they hold an appeal for me- I really like the visual style of the game. Small touches like the animation of using a table saw to cut logs into planks are very satisfying.  The music is nice, though quite often a bit too understated.\n\nThe free to play system of Eldevin is fantastic. There's barely any restrictions at all. That being said, I subbed after a couple of days becuase it's only $6.99.\n\nIf you are the type of player who will just want to level fast without doing crafting or anything to get to 'endgame', that attitude won't work here.

With gameplay kinda like Runescape mixed with Ultima Online, and a dash of Diablo, your not gonna regret this one, easy in and out gameplay, thorough story line, and questing that seems funner than just following arrows, makes it one of the top mmos out there to play, only regret that its not wide known (hardly any advertising on the net).  Its fairly new I believe and that leaves me hoping that much more will be added to this potentially massive and deep game.  Sure the graphics arent eye popping candy, but that is also what sets it apart from the big guys, and thats a good thing, still has plenty of detail and attractiveness to keep you engaged for hours n hours.  Its free to play and is a small download thats easy to play in window mode ( I recommend full screen mode tho ).  Craft, farm,fish, harvest, garden, ect... You could spend all day not killin a thing and still have a good time so come one come all, give it a shot and I bet one day you'll be writing your own review, and trying to get your friends into this world of adventure.!","December 26, 2014","true","22.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

This harkens back to that era in gaming with some significant improvements in gameplay. The game is very "let's take this classic formula and apply what we've learned over the last decade"\n\nThe controls take some getting used to after adapting to the new controls of most MMO's, but once you've got that the gameplay is smooth.

I was cautious about the game at first, but after playing it, I think the game is worthwhile anyone's time who enjoys a classic MMORPG. I'll break down the pro's and the con's of the game, and explain why they are in their respective places.\n\nThe Pro's:\n1.) There are no classes. You create your own class through the talent system and various abilities you learn as you level.\n2.) The game is very punishing in terms of not respecting mobs. Especially "elite", "champion", or "boss" mobs.\n3.) The game feels very interactive with you and your character, very rarely are you not doing something while in combat from my experience.\n4.) The game is complex, and not in a bad sense, but in terms of that the game doesn't hold your hand past the tutorial, and you have a lot of information to understand and process in order to play efficiently and effectively.\n5.) There is plenty to do, between quests, events, professions, dungeons, etc.\n6.) The game has a very small community. This can be a good or bad thing depending on preference, however, because of this, you make friendships with other players very easily, and for the most part, all of the players are very helpful, respectful, and welcoming of new players.\n7.) The game doesn't feel like a stereotypical MMORPG Grindfest. This may be more relating to the fact that the combat is very interactive in the game.\n8.) No pay to win garbage. Nearly everything from the cash shop can be purchased with in-game gold at some point or another. (Gold to Paid-Currency Ratio is about 1:3) All of the items from the cash shop are either purely cosmetic, or serve such a minimal purpose, it doesn't impact you.\n9.) The graphics. I know plenty of people will disagree with me here, but I do enjoy the simplicity of the game's art-style. It's very original and appealing to look at. It's not an overly-glamorous professional graphics design, with high resolution textures and models. Whilst, I do like very high-end graphics, and I give full respect for those who can do such, it's become the norm. Therefore, it's nothing special. These graphics, however, are, in my opinion.\n10.) The questing isn't linear. I can't go from level one to max level running in basically a straight line.\n\nThe Con's:\n1.) (Intended or not) There [appears] to be an issue with auto-attacking where it must remain on your action bars, and you must use the action-slot that it's in, in order to auto-attack. This is not significant in any way, shape, or form, and is only a personal qualm of mine.\n2.) Not being able to track multiple quests at once can be a tad tedious at times, but it's nothing significant.\n3.) There appears to be quite a few issues with collision boxes on some in-world items. (I.E: Trees, boxes, etc.)\n4.) Updates are few and far in between, which, can be a good or bad thing, depending on the way you look at it. It's good if you are a casual player trying to progress to max level, it will give you quite a length of time to get there and not feel the rush or obligation to do so as soon as humanly possible. It's bad if you are already at the end-game, and are sitting on your hands with nothing to do, assuming you've accomplished every thing possible up to that point.\n\nOverall? I give this game a 10/10 in honesty. The cons are so insignificant it truly doesn't impact the gameplay enough for me to want to dilute my rating of the game.\n\nTL;DR - If you get past the graphics, if you are a graphics junkie, the small community, and lack of updates, then this game is for you.","May 29","true","24.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","4"

Avatar graphics look to be from 2001, and building and water graphics from 2004-2005. There is some lag, especially around extra busy areas.\n\nAnd yet, this could be one of the best MMO's out there currently.\n\nAfter having tried different MMO's out including LOTRO, SWTOR, and Spiral Knights, I can now look back at these and see where Eldevin has some of that or has corrected the mistakes these other popular MMO's have failed. Eldevin has a huge world to explore and discover, much like LOTRO. But with much better free roam possibilities. I just did a lvl 7 quest that had lvl 32 Ai.\n\nSWTOR pushes you to choose a class. And theres no going back once its made. So your stuck between better powers or better storyline. SWTOR pretty much makes you need a team of players to fight boss's, and to be a higher level than the one your doing. SWTOR nags you about spending rl money on their game, going so far as to raise prices of the items you buy with credits, just for being a free-to-play player! Eldevin's quests are pretty simple and can be soloed pretty much, with a few tougher quests mixed in where you need a team, giving the game a great balance. I can be lvl 8 and take down a lvl 9 Ai. Might be a big fight and I lose extra HP, but least I dont get one-hit and die. Eldevin also lets you pretty much choose which side you want at a relaxing pace. Eventually you'll choose, but its more of just putting points into character traits. Now compare what I said about SWTOR, and Eldevin. You can easily see that Eldevin is the easier, more relaxed, and better able to get into than SWTOR.\n\nEldevin is also really a free-to-play game! As of when Im writing this, you can spend rl money for cosmetics, mounts, mount riding trait, potions, pets, and other knick-knacks. So no new player can come along, throw 100$ into Eldevin, and suddenly be the #1 player in-game, 2 hours later. Thats perhaps one of Eldevin's brightest points.\n\nYou can also earn reputation points with different factions in Eldevin. All these points do is show what type of quests you have done and lets you earn special vanity(cosmetic items) to wear in-game! That means you have complete freedom to choose which side(s) you choose to support! Though I have not yet found how to earn good reputation points with some of the factions yet, it would appear that they're out there somewhere.\n\nIm still wearing the armour and helmet I recieved at level 4. Im now level 9. Most MMO's would drill you to change your gear every 2-3 ranks, with you dieing in battle every time, due to lack of armour stats. Maybe I have stronger weapons and thats why Im not having much trouble, but it seems the only limit to what gear your wearing is up to you making it, and your level.\n\nI still have some mixed feelings about the professions, your healing ability, and the combat. The professions are a nusiance at best, yet the majority of new gear you can get for battle, so far, comes from being able to make your own gear(armoursmithing) which requires Mining. The rest, Im not sure about. The majority of players also agree in-game that this is annoying and perhaps the games worst point(next to the graphics in my book). I find woodcutting to be the useless profession as Im still yet to find whats the point of having logs and turning them into boards. Ill see as the game progress's for me.\n\nThe magical healing ability is, without a doubt, a very useful ally in-game. However, it heals such a tiny amount of your life, that its almost not worth the few second wait as you heal. Potions and eating food heals more in one use than this ability.\n\nCombat is very nice! But maybe just a tad unbalanced. Archery is, no doubt, the strongest attack. I can weaken any enemy with 3 archery shots before it can even start its attack on me. They say melee is strong, but archery will end up being the best attack.\n\nThere is LOTS more I could say showing how great Eldevin is, but why should I? Just download it and see its awesomness yourself. It took me 4-5 minutes to download and took almost no MB. Hunted Cow Studios also has other computer games, including another MMO which has been out either 8 or 10 years depending where you look, and still seems to be going strong. So this game should be great. And with the promise of guilds coming, things will only look to get better. So install the game, enjoy the game, and see how MMO's should really be like! Especially if you played Free Realms or Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures before they shutdown(oh terrible day!) then you will also love Eldevin.","November 23, 2014","true","128.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The control take a bit of getting used to, but I think that's more the fault of the player than the game itself. The quests range from combat-oriented to simple run-around-and-pick-stuff-up quests that can tip you over the experience edge when you don't feel like killing another dozen or so Shigra in the early stages. Crafting is proving to be a fun diversion, too, with options ranging from cooking to alchemy to weaponsmithing. The standard crafts, basically, but that doesn't make them any less amusing to do.\n\nMy only complaint is that while there's much of the game you can accomplish solo (which is nice for me, since I love the MMO style but am not so keen on random interaction with strangers), there are quests that can't be cleared without a party. And since there are so few players of the game, you can someone be waiting the better part of an hour for someone to jump in the quest queue so you can clear out a dungeon that's "too hard" to do alone. (Seriously, when the dungeon level is 5 and I'm level 10, I can do it myself. Really. Just watch me!) You can, to the game's credit, keep doing other things while you wait for a party to be gathered, but it's still frustrating to be forced into group situations when you don't really have to be.","April 22, 2015","true","38.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I actually think that the lack of players works out in everyones favor. See in WOW the servers are very crowded and from a purely social standpoint it is very easy to get lost in the crowd. Here if you try you can make friends I mean there are some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s but there are also a lot of great players. I find it easy to approach sommeone alone by a dungeon and ask if you would like to do it together. There are also only six classes to choose from so a player can get comfortable with each class and the strategy used to play it which is hard to do. It also can be difficult for some people to get used to communicating online and in MMOs and feel this game is great for that. I enjoy the game and hope the developers update it to increase the interest in new players. It is free to play so there is no cost which is good. They also have seasonal events which are quite enjoyable. I guess every MMO has its problems but It has decent multiplayer interface and I lot of quests. The dugeons are fun to go through if you have a good team of people. Again it is basically like runescape so if you like runescape you will like this game. The developers will hopefully continue to update the game and create tasks to keep players involved and hopefully one day they will have enough people to run PVP events. I personally found no trouble to find people to do dugeons with and if you need someone I would definitely go with you.","April 17","true","173.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Story, skill trees, and professions are well designed and has many potentials to be free from the standard playing style where u are fixed to your own class. However there are a few major shortcoming.\n\nStory-wise, the quests brings you throught the story quite nicely and smoothly however I would disagree on the breaking up of the major quests to multiple smaller quests and you can only advance when u reach a particular level. This make me feel like the story like always left hanging after a quest completion and there are a few major quests with all different sequence. This really breaks the storytelling part of the game.\n\nSkill trees is up for a praise. Freedom to be whatever you want and not restricted by class is one I really like. Feels more fun when you can have a Battle Mage instead of just a mage. It opens up to numerous possiblities of character customization.\n\nProfessions well its fun if you need a sidetrack from the battle. What I like about the professions is that you are not restricted and you can level whichever profession you like provided you are willing to burn those hours in. What I don't like about professions are the professions' equipments. There is basically no way to upgrade your professions' equipment.

The thing I enjoy most about the game however, is its ambience. Now, this may sound odd due to the graphics from 1999, but thats actually what I enjoy. It is a very "busy" game that requires a lot of quests, but for the most part the quests are sprawled out enough to the point that it doesnt always feel repetitive, which is a problem I've noticed a lot in mordern MMOs. Nonetheless, if you enjoy MMOs at all, I highly recommend this game.","November 25, 2014","true","11.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The community is very sociable towards each other and willing to help anybody who needs it.  So don't be shy to ask anything about the game in global chat.  If you have any suggestions the Developers do listen to the feedback from the community.\n\nIf you're looking for great graphics in this game.  Eldevin isn't the game for you.  If you're and old school rpg gamer, this is a game you should try.  Gameplay has a old school feel and is very enjoyable with no class restrictions.  For old Runescape players Eldevin resembles it somewhat like professions and crafting.  Though this game is missing a few aspects of a regular MMO.  The Devs made assure that they will be adding it in the future.","November 6, 2014","true","248.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Just like RuneScape - this type of graphics, gameplay and controller is probably disliked by those who like AAA quality games.\nPersonally I find this game really fun and really immersive. I usually get bored of all ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes within hours because all they contain is shipping the player around the map and end game content. Not Eldevin.\nUpon minutes of entering the game and walking through the tutorial, I got lost in the map with no consequences. I ended up in a city where I got adopted into a homeless gang through a subquest which escalated to helping cleanse a city from plague and assasinating a poor old man for no reason what so ever. The extreme amount of quests and the game not punishing the player for wandering around the map and picking up random quests is what makes this game amazing.\nI definitely reccomend it!","November 16, 2014","true","13.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You can tell that writing and story are important to the devs, and as such you're rewarded better than the usual outing. Its no TSW, but certainly a far better focus on story than most.\n\nOpen-skill, classless system of advancement.

The launcher is simple and works but does need more work as sometimes it can become buggy, Character creation is pretty simple too but it works, remember this game is NOT about prettty graphics but instead "Gameplay"!\n\nThere are a great many of quests to do and some of the story related ones can be quite interesting if you take the time to read them, there are also plenty of side quests that some will skip through to ease the grinding... About the grind, there is a lot of it and most is good if you approach it the correct way such as the crafting system, it is bery robust and lots of depth. You can do prospecting, fishing, cooking, weaponsmithing and armorsmithing and severl more. The way it works is that each time you do something like mining ore it levels up, and so far I have come to see that you can make some really nice gear that you can sell to other players for a decent price.\n\nThere is plenty of things you can do solo if that is your style, but there is also a pretty nice community of veteran players who will be happy to help you out if you ever want to group up and do some of the cool dungeon quests, some of them can get you some nice rewards such as gear and relics.\n\nOverall I would have to say that this is a decent MMO that will only get better as they keep working on it, as it is now there is tons of content to play with and just might find yourself addicted to it :-)","November 15, 2014","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are completely free to do whatever you want, whenever you want ( just like runescape )\n2. Many professions, items scaled for each profession as you gain levels in it\n3. The class tree is basically like Runescape, but better.. and here's why\n- You start the game, and during the tutorial you're taught basic MEELE, MAGIC, RANGE skills\nthen from there on out, you level and spend attributes to whatever you want to increase in\nThere are talent trees aswell, about 7 of them but you're free to mix them up, ( half points into assasin, and/or mage )\nVery free to build yourself the way you want ( Like Skyrim )\n4. Player base is huge, friendly community, since i've started i've been asked if I wanted help several times from\nhigher level players.\n5. Eldevin has been quoted that even though you can pay to gain advantages ( xp boost, profession xp boost )\nEVERY ZONE IN THE GAME IS FREE TO EXPLORE for FREE or PAID players and it's staying that way.\nThis is NOT a P2W game.\n6. There is PVP, group dungions, solo dungions, great replay value, and grinding is fun\n\nNow those are just some of the great things in Eldevin..\nHere's what will drive some people off right away..\n\n1. Bad graphics ( for the average mmo out today ) BUT That goes without saying, it's gameplay is much better than almost every other MMO out today. If you liked Runescape and that playstyle you WILL love this game.\n2.WASD is in motion, yes you can click on the map to go somewhere, or even right infront of you just like runescape,\nAlthough WASD is much more comfortable to use, it is a bit clunky and should be refined abit more.\n\nHope I helped someone make a decision. I don't normally do reviews ( maybe 1 before this ) but I used to look at games thinking oh that looks good, then read 1 bad review and never look at it again.. well I suggest you try it out for yourself, I did and I do not regret it at all, I'll be playing this for a long time..

This is my personal experience. I got off the game, got back on it, and WASD and the spell numbers would not work. They litterally would'nt work, I had to click to move and use spells.\nCharacter Customization is not the best. You cannot make your own face and you have to choose from ugly faces.\nAlso, this might not really be major, but the graphics. I said they were decent, but for a 2013 game? Come on, Hunted Cow!\n\nThat is my opinion on this game, but the main reason for my thumbs-down rating is for the controls breaking.\n\nThanks for reading.","December 6, 2014","false","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you judge on graphics, you're really only just scratching the surface. For a free MMO (well, mainly free, there is certainly an P2W aspect in here but it's mainly ignorable) this game has a lot of content and a lot of things to sink your time into, especially with a few friends. With a huge skill tree system and no locking into classes, the amount of customisation available to you from the offset it vast and interesting. Although the basic roles offered in most MMOs are also present here - Damage, Tank and Healer - there are other ways to really customise your character and class as much as you would ever want to. There are lots of things to do on the map, such as dungeons, and the professions system is quite in-depth and enjoyable. While there is a lot of grinding, the grinding in this game is among the most enjoyable I have ever had.

Which i thought was neat. As ive played runescape for a good 7 years. This game is similair to runescape. But with a better community. For example, I made 2 characters one was going to be a female assassin, the other a male mage. And both of those characters Ive had people help me get better gear.

I'm really just unsure about this game, I do want to say that if your looking for a classic runescape feel. This is it. I'm sure it's been said many times also. I played this game hard, I went on a binge for two days. It's addicting. I thought the game was new, but it's been out for a year. At launch, a year ago, apparently it was very buggy, but of course it would be. I just feel. for a steam launch, they should have cleaned the slate. The game is basic in terms of gameplay, which can be a good thing, however you can bow kite the hard stuff or tab target grind quite easily. I have heard bad rumors. 80% of players are bots. Crazy grind later on and for crafting. Currency is store gems, everyone uses this to trade items. You can just buy the gems and get all the gear you need. For pvp, i have not tried it. But I can assume ranged wins. I hear there aren't much for group dungeons. It is quite story diven, which means plenty of solo play. During my time, I feel that there were too many quests and not enough actuall slaying things. Give us spots to make a group and claim a goblin camp. Dungeons are instanced. It's not exactly freeform like runescape, i got fed up with city quests and went into the sewers, though I needed to do a chain of quests apparently and that's when I stopped playing.\n\nThis game is still in beta, so a lot of good change is to come. Make a fresh server for steam bro's. Make a ruthless pvp server for the hardcores. (hey p1999 folks) Add in a jump or dodge skill, skillcap for this game is extremly low. Give us interesting classes, monk/necro/enchanter. I'd be fine paying 20 bucks at the front for a non free to play game.\nSo, it's worth playing for a couple of hours, I dunno if you'd wanna go deep into the game.","November 10, 2014","false","14.6"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","20","39","0","1"

I'm no elite top-level player, but I have put enough into the game to have some opinions about it.\n\nOk, on with the review...\n\nEldevin is a fantasy MMORPG that does a lot of really good things, but these things aren't particularly new to the genre. And that's not necessarily a bad thing IMO.\n\nMany compare it to other games like Runescape, and that is completely understandable. However, once you start playing, you will see some stark differences. It's approach to the genre is more of a themeparky style with PvE raids and traditional PvP game modes. Grab some loot from these instances and you'll then see the game's emphasis on a wide crafting system in which you make some nice gear. You have lots of quests to do, many of which are fetch-quests, but there are some nice cutscenes that propel the story forward. As either a sword-n-board tank, ranger, healer, warrior, mage, or hybrid build, you'll definitely have some quests to do.\n\nI must also say that this game is pretty on the eyes. Yes, others may not be too impressed about this game's graphical fidelity, but the overal *aesthetic* is very nice. Eldevin used to have an isometric view like Diablo, but the devs worked hard to make it 3D since many of the players wanted to see changes. The devs are pretty committed to seeing this game thrive, as they are active on the forums. The community is nice too both ingame and on the official forums.\n\nIn all, Eldevin does not introduce new ideas, cutting-edge mechanics, or innovative gameplay, but it does what it does very well. Based off of this, you might think "Well, why should I play this, then?" If you are looking for a themepark MMO that changes everything and flips the genre upside-down, then Eldevin is *NOT* the game for you. On the other hand, if you are searching for a solid title with grindy-yet-satisfying crafting, good combat with nice build variety, beautiful aesthetics, and on-point gameplay, this is the game for you. All it needs is more content to truly become a premier free-to-play MMO. I'll give it a 7.5/10.","November 6, 2014","true","72.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomineh/recommended/298160/","nomineh","Nomine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomineh/","759 products in account","50 hours in-game:\n\nEldevin is a addictive, slow-paced and story-driven MMORPG that is similar to Runescape 2 in many aspects.\n\nYou have a freedom of choice when it comes to using your talent points and building your character - You can pick any role and switch later on. When starting out, you are given a bunch of quests - In fact, more than you need to level up. Quests require a lot of travel and in order to do quests you need to have combat stats. It doesn't take long to level combat, but if you just keep doing combat you miss out on various loot and skilling (profession) opportunities - there being 14 different professions.\n\nProfessions can be tedious to level up because of slow animations (that you have to wait for), having too little inventory space, requiring a lot of travel and the materials costing too much at least early on. The sell price for most items is too low; you are constantly low on cash if you decide to use the materials you find for training professions. Only quests seem to reward a good amount of money at least at lower levels.\n\nCrafting professions can require 2-4x more effort to level up than a gathering profession. What I mean by this is that you'll reach the max prospecting level 3 or 4 times in the time you max Jewelry, Armorsmithing and Weaponsmithing. I think this is rather stupid - it's just a time consuming grind to get to higher levels of each crafting profession for almost no benefit.\n\nEven at higher levels, the time it takes to get to a level that matches your combat is better spent elsewhere. Instead of spending 10 hours to level 5 crafting levels, you could spend 10 hours questing and get 5 combat levels. Why should you do questing then? Because even if you get one crafting profession to your combat level, you'll only get that profession's specific equipment pieces; for example, a crafted heavy armor helmet to complete the set you just got from a dungeon, leaving rings/amulet/charm and weapons to be made with Jewelry and Weaponsmithing respectively. So yes, in short, the crafting professions feel useless and too tedious to level up.\n\nGetting so little money from enemies and items early on creates problems because you need money for repair and training a profession. For example, from a level 10 quest you get 2 silver - it costs 2 silver to buy 4 butter (buy from npc) to go with your 8 ham (skinning/loot) and 4 garlic (farming) that you need to make 4 cooked hams at level 8 cooking. Yes, that's 2 silver or 1 quest to make 4 items.\n\nThere are a LOT of fetch quests with way too much travel; some are literally "go talk to north, go talk to south, talk to northeast, talk to southwest..then visit these locations, but first go to the beach and then check out the very end of a dungeon" type quests. The quests are all over the place (which can be nice, but not when most of them make you travel back and forth so much).. There also needs to be more item rewards in quests - The only weapons you get from quests (or anywhere else) at level 5-10 are either: one level 5 rare (boss or quest), level 6-10 uncommon (crafted) and level 10 legendary for legendary quest and then again you don't get any other good weapons until level 15. Crafted items are useless here too because they are all uncommon up to level 10 or at least worse than your weapons found from quests.\n\nThe game is good otherwise, but indeed could use some improvements. I really like the soundtrack though, it's great. The graphics are good for a MMO of this type, but the game has some bugs. Your cursor can go crazy at random intervals because the game process starts to use more resources, your camera can start to spin in certain places and make it hard to turn it.\n\nThe controls are great, being able to either click or move with WASD like in WoW, but it'd be nice if your character tried to get to the given location. Sometimes when you click, for example to move inside a tent through a narrow door, the character goes back and forth. If you move straight towards a small object, your character doesn't try to avoid it either.. I'd think it'd be nice if it did.\n\nThe in-game mounts don't really feel like mounts with the small 20% speed increase at early levels and 60% at later levels. A small buff would be nice.\n\nadd later:\n\nagain a lot of travel from all of this\nequipment taking a lot of space if you want to save some of it as a outfit for later - no huge equipment bags (like vanity)\nthere is no auction house and no place for trading\nactions take long to do\nenemies out of range even if in range\nevents for veterans missable by newer players\nbecause quest starting points are all over the place and some quests are for the same area, its not uncommon to see higher levels in low level zones still completing some quests\nbecause of the reasons mentioned above, quests should be shown further to you on the map.\nsoundtrack is awesome, but cannot be found anywhere.\n5 loyalty points per login for f2p - full loyalty set = 9000 points\nthere are some p2w items; subscription literally gives you extra exp, prestige, profession exp, removes gold cap (WTF literally)\neven vital skills such as skinning can get behind in your combat level because of so many quests at certain levels and not having enough space for quest items/skinning. this means you have to go back to lower level monsters and just kill them for skinning exp so you can continue questing with the ability to skin your level monsters.\nskill quests: for example level 16 giving tasks to get level 1 or level 8 gathering prof. items; can be annoying.\nabilities not powerful, animations take long which makes them very ineffective.\ncertain abilities are broken and some descriptions are a bit off.\nat least the templar talent tree doesn't feel very optimized\nno third skill bar for alt/ctrl/shift + normal keybinds even though there are a lot of skills\n\nlevel balance seems to be a bit off. lets say you barely solo a LV10 dungeon in story mode at level 11, then return after getting a new piece of epic boss dropped gear - you'll be able to do it without much worries.\n\nmost boss fights can't be tanked, but have to be taunt-kited instead; really need some work here...need aoe marks on floor and clear indicators of what the bosses are going to do (this one boss on "dungeon" difficulty does 60% of a tanks hp on one melee swing and there aren't many healers playing the game (and if there were, they wouldn't heal much). this is extremely frustrating when paired with the movement / combat system of eldevin\n\nthere is an achievement for killing 100 000 players in the wilderness and another one for winning 2000 battlegrounds.\n\nthis is just pathetic because no one will get those legitly; they just take too long. As a comparison, I, still at rank 20 rogue on my realm in WoW ( even though i haven't played for a year), I had 44025 honorable battleground kills and played 1438 battlegrounds.\n\nyou have three options\n\n1) quest and only level combat, do not pick up profession items - your inventory won't be full at all\n\n2) quest, level combat and pick up profession items - your inventory will be very full quickly because two  4-9 slot bags aren't really helpful\n\n3) pay 10ecash and get a 64 slot bag a long with other goodies and have no trouble questing, leveling combat and training professions.\n\nwhy can't f2p system be more in between option 1 and 2?\n\nLegendaries take too much space for f2ps. whats a legendary item when it has to be sold to npc for 10 silver because you don't have 2 to 6 space for it?\n\ntarget out of range even if close issue\n\ninsane respawns at certain locations means you cant melee the monsters or you get overwhelmed\n\nI'll edit this later...","November 7, 2014","true","55.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Same for the global game mechanics where you can shape your character's abilities the way you like (yes, a true class-less system!). But that's as far as I can go with the positive things about this game...\n\nThe game is written completely in Java, and both the art and performance look like it. Art is like we're back in 1998, animations are very clunky and performance suffers from the Java coding (good thing the art is so simple that on today's PCs you don't notice it).\n\nThen the community, or rather lack of it. The website states that there are over 400K players registered. Though a pretty massive number for an unknown Java MMORPG, only around 100-150 have been online during the times I checked it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/recommended/298160/","goldenagegmr","GAGMR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/","425 products in account","HUGE EDIT\n\nOkay I've played this game a bit more, learned about it & I've decided to change my rating because of this one fatal flaw that completely ruins the game.\n\nYOU HAVE TO PAY TO RESPEC or wait 2 months!\n\nYes, that one little but HUGE flaw is making me not want to bother playing this game anymore.  Any game that emphasizes class customization makes you WANT to try out all the different specs that you can & this is just plain exploitation of their own system to FORCE you to pay money to try different things & for that I am saying NO.\n\nIf the game ever gets rid of this pure exploitive tactic then I may come back, until then I'm staying away.\n\nREVIEW\n\nNow before I start my review let me just say that a lot of people are comparing this game to Runescape & saying it's just a clone.  While this game & Runescape have a few things in common they are both completly different as a whole.  Now, with that said let's get on with the review.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nLet me begin with the games graphics since it will be the first thing you see about the game.  The graphics aren't anything amazing or ground breaking but they do have their own unique feel.  It resembles oldschool RPG's like Morrowind & Neverwinter while pulling off it's own look in between.\n\nThere are some things I wish the game had graphics wise, however.  The game does have a day/night cycle but this feels like it's simply achieved by a slight contrast change.  Half the time you won't know if it's night or day unless you use the /time command which will bring up the current in game time.  Another thing I wish this game had would be a sun or a moon.  If you choose to bring the games camera down to OTS level you will notice the sky is bland & lifeless.  There is also no real time shading in the game.\n\nJust because the graphics aren't great doesn't mean this game doesn't look good because it does.  It also feels alive in the scenery that you will see change depending on the time of day.  Some civilian NPC's have their own schedule & at evening to late night hours you will see the taverns start filling up with people.  They will even start having their own conversations while doing their daily activities that you can eavesdrop on.  The ones I've seen so far have been guards talking while on patrol & drunken men flirting with barmaidens.  This small feature alone brings out a lot more life to the game.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe game can be played in 2 different ways.  Point & Click or WASD style.  So, if you prefer the top down camera point & click style ARPG you can play it that way.  If you prefer the OTS camera & walking with WASD you can do that as well.  You can seemlessly move between the 2 styles.  All & all it feels good & responsive.\n\nThe animations in the game are lacking, however.  They are simple, smooth & get the job done.  They aren't flashy like most MMO's are doing nowadays..  You won't see any moves that involve jumping around while attacking but you will see your character go into a solid stance.  When you attack it feels a little too quick.  Melee animations consist of quick swipes or jabs sometimes several per second that make it seem like your character is on speed or had too many energy drinks.\n\nI do like the emotes a lot, though.  If you get your character drunk he will stumble around or vomit on himself.  It's pretty funny & probably worth playing the game to see that emote alone.\n\nMy only real complaint is no matter how much I push spacebar it never jumps.  :'(\n\nCRAFTING\n\nThis game has a ton of crafting.  If you like games where you can spend hours upon hours of just crafting then you will probably enjoy this game.  I myself have already spent the majority of my game time doing nothing but crafting.  The best part is you can master all the crafts the game has to offer, so you will be busy for a while.\n\nThe game has weapon & armor smithing, cooking, leatherwork, jewelcraft, alchemy, tailoring, etc.  Every craft has it's own gathering profession. All of which are available to master.\n\nCLASSES\n\nThis game utilizes a custom class system.  In short, you are what you want to be.  And I don't mean you are what you want within the games limits.  You are what you really want.  If you want to be a Battlemage in heavy plate you can do that.  If you want to be an archer with a big 2h weapon you can do that too.  This game's class system is possibly one of the coolest in any MMO I've played.\n\nYou earn points each level & you can put those points into Health, Mana, Melee, Range, Magic, & Crit/Accuraccy,  It's very easy to build a pure style or hybrid class.  If you plan on trying to do all 3 rolls you may have a harder time.  All equipment also increases these stats varying depending on what type of equipment you use.\n\nThere are also 6 Talent Trees.  Templar(Shield), Warrior (2H), Assassin (Dual Wield), Ranger, Mage & Prophet (Heals).  These trees each specialize in a specific weapon or spell type & gives passive/active abilities depending on which weapon/armor/spells you plan on using.\n\nThe best part about this game's class system is how you go about learning spells/abilities.  You simply buy a scroll from a trainer & learn it.  You keep the ability you purchase forever as well.  Respecs are just for points & talents.  The more powerful spells for each class are in the talent trees which you have to unlock by putting in points.\n\nOVERALL\n\nIt's got a great oldschool vibe with a mix of modern day elements & manages to also do some things other games haven't done before.  If you're aching for an old school RPG or MMO experience without the subscription then you should check this one out.\n\nI would recommend downloading the game client outside of STEAM, though.  I was having some wierd bugs running the steam version & all of that went away when I used the install from their official website.","February 23, 2015","false","7.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

By far it has the best f2p model out of any game I've ever seen. Instead of penalizing you for not being a supporter, you have access to 100% of the game without any restrictions, being a supporter just gives you buffs, and overall makes the game more easily playable later down the road with things such as double relic gain to increase the speed in which you get armor sets and so on.\n\nSo let's start with the pros of the game, of course everyone has different opinions so some things I like a lot, others might think is no big deal. First, as of now there is no Auction House, which I deeply enjoy because it makes trading a much more personal, and organic feeling, to actually have to look for someone selling/buying something makes you really feel like your trading unlike dumping stacks of items into an AH and waiting for someone to buy it and automatically receive gold. I enjoy the "class" system, as in there really are no classes, there are multiple talent trees including your three classic archtypes; ranger, warrior, and mage, followed by assassin, prophet, and templar. You are free to spend your points wherever you choose, thus  making it really feel like you're building your own unique class.\nAttribute points are much the same, you get 6 attribute points every time you level in which you are free to spend between 6 attributes; vitality, energy, focus, ranged, sorcery, and melee. Allowing you to make countless combinations with this system. The thing I like the most about the game is the limited number of skills you can use. Often times in most MMOs, such as World of Warcraft I find that I have about 10,000 abilities, and about 9,950 do the same exact thing, or slightly off of another ability. With so many abilities I find myself constantly watching over my action bars and never focusing on the actual game, then I question myself "Why am I playing a game where all I do is watch little squares fill up again and glow so then I can click and watch them again?" It feels like I'm ochestrating a Beethoven piano masterpiece. However, in Eldevin it's much, much different I can go through a dungeon using only 3-4 abilities and focus more on the game and the environment rather than just my action bar managing cooldowns, that being said however, the combat is very basic, standstill and attack combat.\n\nNow, onto the cons, before I start however, I know that Eldevin is NOT a Triple A, mainstream production and that it is an indie f2p MMO, therefor there is some room for slack. Right off the bat I noticed how rough the human animations are, your arms stand straight to your sides and when you run it isn't much better. I specifically say human animations, because not all the animations are bad, which blows my mind, because as you progress through the game you'll encounter various style of spiders, and I'd say the spider animations are about 99% legit, their legs move realistically, almost to the point where it's scary. With that being said, I don't understand why your own character is so rough when there's spiders out there that are 10x better. Eldevin is able to be controlled using a classic WASD system, however it is also point-to-click, much like Runescape. This offers a different, unique style of movement not offered by other MMOs, it can also be a nuisance as well, often times the path finding is clunky and your cameras and character will flip out and run in different directions, or as a mage or ranger you'll go to begin to attack a target from a range, and instead of getting into line of sight and attacking, you'll run straight up into the mobs face and then start attacking, little things like this bother me, and in my opinion it'd be better off without point-to-click movement in total. I have to admit, I did have quite a bit of fun leveling in this game, the max level is 45, and it took me roughly 5-6 days to reach it, playing pretty regularly, the quests are your typical generic MMO quests, but occasionally you'll get a long story line that removes you from that "Collect 10 Boar Flanks" "Grab 12 Bags of Flour" ditch that drags on. The Story lines are decent enough and long enough to provide you with a break from all the grinding as you unsolve mysteries like who assassinated a mage without the Arcane Sanctum, or freeing a brigade of Eldevin soldiers from the Void. Besides the story lines, the questing is nothing substantial and you'll be glad to reach level 45. The dungeons are much the same as the quests, just grinds. There is Story Mode dungeons which are soloable, (farmable) and Dungeon Mode dungeons which are undoable for the most part due to the low population of the game, average queues are between 1hr-2hrs on most days for most dungeons, so for the most part you'll be soloing Story Mode dungeons. The bosses in the dungeon are nothing short of spectacular, 90% of them are basic Tank n' Spank fights with AoEs to avoid, nothing ground breaking, and nothing challenging. The biggest problem with the game, and you sort of can't blame the game, but then again if the game was more popular it wouldn't have the problem, is it's low population, you'll see the same people online all day, every day. You'll group with the same people, trade with the same people, and talk with the same people. Which isn't too much of a problem, because you'll just get to know them and befriend them, or dislike them and have bitter rivalries, but it would just be nicer to have a larger population, but I guess every game wants that right? The low population calls for many problems though such as; the limited amount of max level crafters/gatherers, you'll have to wait for them to come online, they're celebrities. The endless dungeon queues, and facing the same people over, and over in PvP, which leads to a major problem. Only the same people PvP in Eldevin, so if you are new to level 45 and undergeared I hightly recommend you DON'T attempt PvP or you'll just be slaughtered in seconds by the top geared members of Eldevin. PvP revolves entirely around gear seeing that the combat is so basic, it's much like the Revolutionary War, lining up across from each other and shooting face to face until the other drops, whoever has the better stats is going to win the spam fireball at each others face game, so PvP loses its appeal to me in this game just for the sheer lack of fun, it's either spam fireball someone less geared than I am, or get spam fireballed by someone more geared than I am. Being 45 in Eldevin in total lacks much fun, it's like growing up, when you are a kid you get to have all the fun, then you become an adult and the serious business starts, likewise is that to the levels in Eldevin, as soon as you hit 45, if you are to compete with other 45's you will need to grind the same dungeon for hours, for weeks, to get the gear, never making you feel accomplished because all you did was spam fireball on some spiders for a week to get your gear.\n\nAll in all it's a decent game, but it needs a lot of work, and a lot of content. It quickly loses its luster as you level. Eldevin isn't all that bad though, it really gives you a generic MMO feel, so its very good for first time MMO players to get the hang of them. It's extremely easy to learn and play, without spending hours watching tutorials or reading up on it. The biggest thing is that it's f2p, and you can't go wrong with that, the only thing you have to spend to play is your time. Therefor I can't "Not Recommend" it, because you can lose anything. It's a good enough game to spend a couple weeks playing, and to revisit occasionally.\n","January 17, 2015","true","139.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Heradite/recommended/298160/","Heradite","Heradite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Heradite/","101 products in account","I decided to try this game since it was free and my ultimate feedback is this: the game is tedious. Like many MMORPGs, there's a lot of work the game wants you to do rather than actually play.\n\nCOMBAT: Basically WoW. It's basically pressing buttons. Not much depth at least in the early going when first impressions are made. That is if auto-attack is off...if it's one, I think the game kinda plays for you. I actually wasn't sure what was happening when it was on: my skills kept activating. Anyways, you'll get levels like "kill X of this kind of bad guy" and it's all very typical.\n\nCRAFTING: You can basically craft a lot. I don't know how the "player economy" works or if there even is one but this is where a lot of the tedious works come in. I got a quest from the armorsmith to make a copper belt. Fine. I have to not only collect cooper which I can live with even. What I couldn't? Having to walk ALL THE WAY BACK TO WHERE I first "learned" how to make copper in order to mine it and then walk ALL THE WAY BACK. You know what I hate? Having to walk back and forth to places to basically run errans that the game sends me on.\n\nIt's true I only played two hours but it felt like a lot longer simply because of how much of the game's content is basically just sending you places and back.\n\nAs for the store, well if you subscribe you get extra XP gain and such so if it's not pay-to-win then it's pretty close.","February 7, 2015","false","2.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

Same for the global game mechanics where you can shape your character's abilities the way you like (yes, a true class-less system!). But that's as far as I can go with the positive things about this game...\n\nThe game is written completely in Java, and both the art and performance look like it. Art is like we're back in 1998, animations are very clunky and performance suffers from the Java coding (good thing the art is so simple that on today's PCs you don't notice it).\n\nThen the community, or rather lack of it. The website states that there are over 400K players registered. Though a pretty massive number for an unknown Java MMORPG, only around 100-150 have been online during the times I checked it.

I love the Fable style use what you want to be good at system, also reminiscent of the Amalur game as well. Choosing between a path in Magic, or Melee and Archery or a mix of both. I have yet to get too deep into this game but it looks as though the character advancement is right up my alley being level based but with a lot of choices in allocating your stats and learning new spells and skills. I am interested to get into the crafting system and to see how my character progresses down the Sorcery line. It has a very sandbox feel, but with guided quests so you have an easy start to the game. The tutorial was well done and I even enjoyed reading the quest text. I'm hoping that this game holds it's charm as I continue to play. I recommend trying it, as it's free and feels a lot like older style MMOs specifically Asheron's Call mixed with a modern day MMO feel.

I found this and it was almost the same but something that i was searching for.\nI haven't played a lot, I'm only level 8 at 6 hours of game play but I think it was worth it. I didn't quite get what was going on with the different icons in-game till later on but the game does explain everything along the way. The combat style is quite fun, you can combine magic, range and melee depending on your fighting tactics. Pressing keys is quite fun in combat as your the one in charge of killing the opponent and not just clicking on your opponent and hoping for the best.\n\nA small downsides to this game is that your faced with the same quests over and over again, its either collect this 10 times or kill that 10 times; really repetitive. The thing that I disliked about this game is the walking... constant walking. If you have a long ranged mission - your basically walking from one side of the map to the other. You can use teleports but there's a cool down...\n\nThe main thing that gets you coming back for more is wanting to buy something with currency you get in-game from killing monsters/completing quests/selling items. You don't actually 'learn' new spells or other ways to attack your enemy, you need to buy them for a large cost. having about 90 bronze makes you feel rich, until you realize 1 iron is 100 bronze and 1 gold is 100 iron - and you only get 15-ish bronze per monster kill. Which is really fun.\n\nAs other people have stated, if you like games like runescape and wow, this is for you.\nIf you don't like repetitive quests and continuous walking, I don't suggest this for you.\n\n:D","November 11, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, when I started playing, the game was doing fine, all it lacked was some balance and end game. But they never added end game content and just kept adding pay to win updates like buying gear upgrades.\n\n\nI'll make this short, these are the bad points of the game, play if you can not mind:\n\n-Pay to win, you can buy everything with real cash, and if you can't, you can buy it from other players by trading, this includes: Gold, Gear upgrading (which can't be done via in-game means), Bag space and others.\n-No actual end game, you repeat 1 same dungeon over and over, after the 100th time it gets kinda boring, after 300th time you just kinda chit chat and make jokes with your teammates while wondering why aren't you using a bot because you're just clicking 1 or 2 spells\n-Crafting is BORING, you know how you gather? Click on an iron ore, now wait 15 seconds, okay, now click on another iron ore. Oh wait, your inventory is full! How about you run 20 minutes back to the bank or pay for some inventory upgrades with real cash?\n-Half of the updates are seasonal events, last one was gathering easter eggs, you walk around map and click on eggs, yes,  you have to do that 2000 times to get a key, which you can buy for 1 euro. That's how much these developers value your time, 1 euro is 10 hours of your time.\n-The game lacks things like action house and guilds, and for some reason it's taking developers YEARS to make it. They also keep postponing the release by giving excuses.\n-The game's population is very small, about 50 people per server online usually.\n-Looking for dungeon group? Spam world chat or ask your friends. By friends I mean half the server, because if you add 30 people as friends, you have half the server there.\n-PVP is dominated by 1 class alone, a mage healer hybrid can deal tons of damage and heal themselves, stomping over everyone else.\n-Leveling is like any other game, the quests are a bit more interesting but not fun at all, you just kill 10 rats and then sometimes you get stuck with no quests, so you kill 500 rats to level just by that.\n\n\nI have tried giving advice to the developers on the game forums for a few months now, I told them to stop with the pay to win updates, I told them how to make end game better, how to make leveling better, how to fix their game and they end up listening to none of what I said, or anyone else for that matter. I consider this game dead now, it will only get worse and I've lost all hope.\n\n\nConclusion: stay away unless you like playing an inferior, grindy, unfun, p2w game.","June 17, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vsnuffles/recommended/298160/","vsnuffles","V snuffles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vsnuffles/","116 products in account","Tl;dr: Like Runescape, but better: faster combat, more fun & simple class building & crafting, better looking and playing world, better tho simple graphics and visual design, great music. Premium currency is not required to win and feels minimally intrusive: great for a free to play. I've played a ranged DPS-type character up to level 17.\n\nLonger review:\n\nI find a lot of MMOs boring but I did play lots of Runescape. This is similar in a lot of ways, but with a faster-paced WOW-like combat system, updated graphics, better music and a richer feeling world which is enhanced by said graphics and music.\n\nThematically they've made a really nice world - I have yet to find an enemy that seems out-of-place in the landscape, and the variety of enemies is pretty decent too. The map is a lot larger than it first looks, but personally it's nice having it divided into easy-to-navigate chunks. These chunks are thematically well done, there's variety in landscape and palettes which is pretty fun. The game feels pretty balanced over-all with how fast you progress and the various currencies you gain. The various groups/allegiences you can gain points with are pretty well thought-out, I think, and it's fun having multiple good-but-flawed factions which have decidedly different methods of dealing with things. The main storyline is servicable enough and works well enough with the presence of so many player characters.\n\nI can't say much about PvP (it's not really my thing) other than that it exists. It's pretty easy to get in a group with people and the loot bidding/sharing system is pretty intuitive and simple, and basic etiquette is easy to grasp. There are no guilds, so everyone kind-of spontaneously forms groups. Also there is no marketplace, so people just trade in chat. This appeals to me, but others may enjoy the management, politics and economics that go with these features.\n\nDungeons can be done in groups or solo, both of which are fun, and can be attempted at 'story' or 'dungeon' modes, depending on how badly you want high level loot and a tough challenge. The big boss spawns are quite fun events to take part in. High-level players generally sheppard/protect lower level players on their way to the spawn location (usually through very high levelled aggro enemy areas), and everyone feels like they're kicking butt whatever their level. I've only played a ranged DPS so far, so I don't know if melee/spell-casting tank/DPS/healer is equally fun.\n\nI also like that crafting here is fairly simple, with not that many tiers of ingredients. The game isn't very old and the level cap is around 45, but I like the minimal variety since too many components can make a game feel messy. There is some variety on each level with rare items you can craft from the ordinary components plus rare drops so I didn't find the simplicity boring.\n\nCharacter-building:\n\nYou're human with not much customisation of appearance. Plenty of hair/skin colours and hair styles, not really much else. Very simple (like Runescape) graphics but decent within the limitations. Most of the game is best played zoomed out so this doesn't really matter.\n\nThere are six simple-enough classes so far, and you start aquiring abilities (attacks, spells, etc) in each, so you can figure out what you like before specialising. The six classes include 3 melee, 1 ranged, and 2 spell-casters, and they specialise in high-damage, high defense and healing. You're linked a basic guide on them to begin with, which is easily found on the wiki, which gives basic suggestions on which armor, weapons and attributes suit which classes. Talents (some abilities and passive upgrades) are divided up into classes, and since sticking to a class means getting higher-tier more impressive talents sooner, it's good to aim for one class early on when picking talents.\n\nThat said, characters aren't bound to any one class, and can equip whatever armor/weapons they like for their level. You'll do best specialising and upping your attributes (ie. weapon ability and max hp/mana etc.) to match your class/playing style. You get a free respec (get to redo all your attribute and talent points) at the start and every 60 days so switching classes is totally possible and easy enough. Good equipment is quite important.\n\nProblems:\n\nSince MMOs are quite grindy, good world-building appeals a lot to me. It's OK having to grind a little if the creatures and setting and crafting items all really suit each other, and different areas have distinct differences. For the most part, Eldevin is great at sticking to theme. The regular armor, some even dorky looking, fits well into the thematically well-made environments.\n\nMost mounts I've seen are out of place in the setting, such as the easiest-to-obtain hover disk. Those that do suit the setting are, I guess, rarer since I don't see in-game all that often. But most I've seen seem not to fit the world very well at all. It's pretty easy to avoid using mounts and plenty of people you pass are on foot (especially in a less crowded server) so this is a minor issue. It still doesn't look good though. There is even a flying carpet which would be great if it looked like an actual rug that suits the setting. There are also quite a few vanity items that also don't look good, though these are less jarring than mounts. Also there are lots of vanity items that suit well enough (the Christmas event jumpers, for one), so it's not so bad.\n\nI would love to be able to craft the clothes the civilians/villagers/city folk wear, maybe even other period-suiting clothes. That would be cool, even if they're very basic, hard to make and don't reap a profit given the price of their ingredients. Vanity items just for real money and/or lots of grinding in-game are great but they're already very impressive, so really mundane craftable vanity items shouldn't stop people buying the more impressive ones that go toward supporting the game.\n\nAnother note regarding the premium currency, I currently feel like I would spend some money on the game but am not really tempted by the offers. A fairly cheap deal for a small fraction of the items in one of the available packs would be nice, even if it is less value-for-money. The pickings aren't too bad, but I'll hold out until there's something I feel like I would really like to get and would enjoy using for the amount of money I would like to spend.","January 8, 2015","true","275.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Decent F2P / Gold-Shop System.","January 11, 2015","true","28.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I played RuneScape ever since the release of the game, and I had only played WoW about 3 years so I can say this game relates quite a bit to both of the games. The game is free, however you do have the option to pay a little more to 'support' the game for some nice benefits. As far as graphics, they aren't that bad to say the least compared to the 'Old School RuneScape' graphics. However, they aren't as great as World of Warcraft's graphics. The gameplay is very fun and adventurous, and I haven't really encountered a lot of immaturity on here as I have on WoW and RuneScape. The community doesn't seem too big, but it is pretty big for a small game. I would definitely recommend downloading this game. Give it about 20 or 30 minutes of gameplay and I'm sure you'll like it.","January 7, 2015","true","25.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

The story line could be better, but then again, this isn't Skyrim!  Also, some of the users could be better at respecting others and what they stand for.  Another note, players aren't the game itself, but they're also participants of the game.  So I think what I said is valid.  If you guys want to catch me in this game, feel free.  I can even help those new characters out there (unless I'm busy).  If you're still wondering what to do in the game, I'll give you guys some tips:\n1: Explore - it's okay to be curious about the game\n2: Be Creative - this game was made for more than just attacking and looting, have fun with it\n3: Respect Others - don't go out of your way to be mean to others or outright insult them - common sense people\n4: Help Other Players - lending a helping hand gets you more friends in life, plus (in my opinion) the game is more fun this way","February 5, 2015","true","260.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm enjoying this game. It has a Runescape feel without being all "Buy. Stuff. Buy iiiiiiiit!". You can be a Premium Member and get cool perks but you can also just do it the old-fashioned, free way and get a very similar experience. It's a quaint game with basic graphics (focusing in on my character's face never fails to elicit a shudder) and my laptop makes the framerate sporadic, but it's a nice time waster. My only gripe is that I wish that the map could expand to include all of my objectives, since with that feature not being there I find myself running all over the place to find someone who may need a quest completed or a place to turn a finished quest in.\n\nI recommend it if you want a basic MMO RPG to mess around in without being required to buy everything to get ahead.","February 7, 2015","true","38.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The mechanics look promising - there are better reviews than this one for that - but I'm mostly a roleplayer, story kind of guy, so that's what I was looking for. The world is interesting but not gripping; there are enough things going on in the world to feel lively, but you can't get involved unless you're the right level. Loot does not go to all players who killed the creature. Nor does everyone get a chance to have a go at the resource nodes. As such, I wasn't excited to see my fellow players. Nevertheless, this plays like runescape + WoW.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't see any roleplay community to speak of, but my time with the game was short.\n\nAll in all, it seems like a solid version of what it is, but it was not my thing. If it's yours, read the mechanics reviews, play and enjoy.","February 7, 2015","true","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I dont think 20 players in an entire regional server is sufficient. Many aspects of a MMO depend on a big community. For instance, the Queueing system in this game is dead. You could wait an entire year and you'd be lucky to get two people to join.\nPvP is dead. And i mean DEAD.\nStory is OK.\nMedieval feel is ruined by a lot of things in this game such as mounts and costumes.\nDungeons - There is a Solo Mode which allows you to go in and get limited loot and exp and there is Dungeon Mode which has stronger enemies and better loot. This mode is dead considering the fact that the queue system is dead. So long, good loot :/\nCrafting and Gathering - You literally lose money doing this. You spend like 5 silver crafting a damn pair of boots only for the vendor to buy it from you for 50 bronze coins. A good way to level up your profession, don't get me wrong, just not to sell.\nIn spite of everything I just said, it's a good game for a beginner. If you are looking for a real MMO, play WoW or SWTOR.\nSave yourself some time.

There is nothing infront of me at the table. As she leaves I notice my loaf in my backpack. Some kind of joke? No one is laughing, though. I decide to at least quickly eat my meal and leave this awkward establishment. I find myself forced to eat sitting under my chair indefinitely for some reason as I take a bite. Something is very wrong here. I abandon the meal, pay and hit the bar. Chugging 3 of their only drinks in less than a minute I lose consciousness and hit the floor hard. I wake up a few seconds later and find myself to be completely sober. Wicked stuff, cheap too.

You will not be able to proceed through the game until you do the lower level quests. I got stuck and almost gave up, but went back and did the lower level quests, then discovered that the part I was stuck at was now working.\n\nThe murky depths quest is one of these quests that is impossible to complete, and higher level areas keep literally pushing you back towards that area, saying you have to complete it first.\n\nOne major problem with the game is its constant insistence to flip the camera angle on you to some random point of view. Every time you go to move, you have to readjust the camera so see what you are doing, very annoying. 99% of the time this can be solved by holding the RMB, but sometimes you forget. Whilst on rotation of the screen, once the mouse reaches the side of the screen, rotation stops, even though the mouse is still moving, another annoyance.\n\nAnother problem is turning off the mouse, what possible reason would there be for that. My char just got killed and I had to click on a button on a pop up window to get resurrected, how do you click on it when you don't know where the mouse is.\n\nNext problem is the severe lack of storage space!\n\nEverything stacks in such small quantities, some as small as 5, just plain crazy because if fills up your backpack too fast to be enjoyable having to sell stuff that you may need sooner or later!\n\nYou can apparently buy sacks and bags etc for real money, but I don't have any of that so will most likely not bother playing it much more simply because you have to constantly sell stuff that you may need, if they would just let you stack things in much larger multiples!\n\nCombat is crap, don't bother trying to move when fighting, it instantly stops fighting. And no dodge what so ever. Stand toe to toe to what ever your fighting and pray that what ever is close by does not decide to join the fight. Even non hostile monsters will occasionally decide that your hurting one of their buddies and then they all gang up on you, end result being a dead character.\n\nCrafting is painful, low level stuff requiring on average 10 of an item to craft some thing. So, you get to craft maybe 10 items tops, before having to run back and gather more of what ever resource you were using to craft with. Wonder if it gets better or worse at higher levels.\n\nYet another problem is your gear keeps wearing out and you have to constantly run back to the local smith to get it repaired.\n\nGood luck if you decide to play it, but not for me :(","November 15, 2014","false","9.6"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","1"

It is a small comunity of people. Becuse its small and all the players there are max lvl of 45 (we'll get back to that) its hard to get a hand with anything. I think its do to the the bordom of being max lvl for a year now when the devas said they are working on it as well as an AH about 6 month ago and keep pushing back the date. The loading time to move from frame to frame is almost longer as it would take to fly from one side to the other side of the frame. I never got any good feedback form HC except for the one time they thanked me for posting the correct link to a safe mode after a big update that cause lagged. As a player I shouldn't have to correct or do their job for them. If you played the game before steam and wanted to switch to steam you have to do so threw HC as HC did not add a prompt to alert you that you need to transfer an old accout threw them and not via steam and you'll be stuck with a lvl 0 account via steam.","December 4, 2014","false","0.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","1"

Personally, I've been looking for games similar to RS, and this has been the closest so far.\nHowever, the servers are extremely laggy for me. Everytime I enter an area, my game freezes for about 5-20 seconds, and frees itself up again. After about 5 more seconds, the whole screen crashes. The issue with the crashes is that Steam still senses me as In-Game, and I can still hear music. However, I cannot end the application with Task Manager, only able to close the game once and for all with a computer restart.\nLooking past the horrendous lag, I can see more people growing a love for the game, as it gives the freedom to shape and mould your character into whatever class you want. I would certainly play it once again if the server lag and crashes are fixed. 4/10","November 9, 2014","false","1.0"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","2"

Yes, is says to do so at the very beginning of the tutorial, but the game jerks you around when you right click the mouse to move, and once you're in a confined space (goblin cave will be the first time this happens bad) your character will run in slow motion for absolutely no...  ♥♥♥♥ing...  reason.

You have to manually put it into fullscreen. Who isn't going to do that? That ♥♥♥♥ just bothers me.\nSecond, the graphics are painfully ugly. Vanilla WoW looks way better than this, and it came out ten years ago. Yeah, I know it's an indie game, but the graphics shouldn't look like they were ripped straight from an N64 game. Someone pointed out that my point this point was invalid. I'm not one to normally gripe about graphics, but this is 2014. It should not be acceptable to release a game that looks like this when there is technology to make it look better.\nCharacter creation was far to minimal. No different races, no different factions, just humans with a few different skins, faces, and hairstyles. If I'm going to be potentially playing with hundreds of other people at once, I want a bit more cosmetic differences in our characters.\nThen the gameplay. It is nothing you aren't going to find in better MMOs.\nIt was advertized that you didn't have classes, and instead selecting random skills to level. That could have been awesome, but the game wasn't good enough after the first quest to make me want to continue, and explore this.\nThe second I encuntered other players, we all began to talk about how terrible this was.\n\nI did not want to play this for longer than I did, because it just wasn't interesting.","November 8, 2014","false","0.2"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","2"

It feels like a cross between Early WoW and Runescape.\n\nThe art is kind of terrible. It seems like half of models don't fit in with the world. and nearly all of the player models seem to be of significantly worse quality than the rest of the game. When I got Eldevin City, presumably the main hub in the game, nearly every higher leveled character i encountered looked like a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. I saw a guy riding around on a ♥♥♥♥ing disk like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed green goblin. Even the RIDING INSTRUCTOR is on a ♥♥♥♥ing flying disc. I saw people on broomsticks, giant goofy ♥♥♥ rabbit things attacking people in the street, and other random ♥♥♥ shit. If there's one thing that needs fixed about this game, it's the art style. Because there isn't one.\n\nThe UI is way to small, like WAAAAAAY too small. I'm not sure if there's a way to change that, but I didn't see one.\n\nMost of the world seems empty. I think I figured out it's because there isn't a sky. It's just a gray overcast all the time. The game ran at an impressive 25 fps in the larger areas, presumably due to poor optimization. The story seemed horrendously cheesy. The player character didn't have hardly any personality at all.\n\nIt isn't THAT pay2win. It has a subscription service, similar to Runescape. Which isn't that bad. Subscribers get like 25% more experience and 25% more gold earned. Everyone is free to buy gold via a premium currency. I didn't bother looking into how much it gold cost.\n\nI'd give this game a 6 out of 10.

I played World of Warcraft, LOTRO, Guild Wars 2, and many other MMO's over they years. This game feels like what I would expect Runescape to feel like, which is quite good. The combat is fast-paced, which I like, the music is standard fantasy stuff, and the graphics induce a sort of nostalgia in me that is just cool. However, if you didn't grow up with a computer, this might not be your game. Also, the camera controls right now kind of suck, but the game definitely makes up for it. 8/10, great game!","April 10, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So you can switch classes and take up professions that works with that class without losing progress on anything. The crafting system has got nice depth to it and still makes sense.\n\nThere are a lot of skills/spells for every class that allows you to build your character the way that fits your play style. You can even use skills from the other classes in your build.\n\nMissions missions missions. There are so many. Dailies that for skills, missions for reputation, missions for craft rewards, side missions and main quests. So if you like missions you wont run out quick. Alternatively, if you don't, you can still dungeon grind your way through levels easy enough.\n\nFinally, the community is nice and helpful. I have done tons of dungeon runs and never got called a noob or derp if I got stuck not knowing how to proceed when doing a dungeon the first time. People are friendly and helpful, which is rare these days.\n\nI am likely missing a lot of things I wanted to add here, but I am rushing to get back in game.\n\nThere are a few hings that gets to me personally, like small stack sizes in inventory and a lot of back and forth running in quests, but I can also understand why this is so. It is not a pay2win, although it leans towards it. You CAN make it without paying, but it would be quite difficult.","August 22, 2015","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll see other comments stating the game has died, or that the player base is empty, but the few people around are the pinacle of a great MMO experience.\n\nWithin the first few hours of playing, I stumbled upon a few other people, all who came up to me and donated gold and gifts without even knowing who I was. There are no bots, it is not pay to win and the story is enjoyable and reasonably unique.\n\nDefinitely give this game a try (it's only a matter of MB to install!) if you are willing to look past some dated graphics and a small playerbase. Besides, each new player allows the game to grow, and the currently small online group means there is never any lag related to server-side issues.","May 27","true","40.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have played a lot of MMORPG's but no one was even close to make me want to play as much as Eldevin already does.\n\nThe community in this game is small but really good.\nI mean i haven't met much players ingame but those who i met really made my day, game and life way better.\n\nThe only con i found of this game is that it has to be played with friend. You cant just rush to solo dungeons. It's nearly inmpossible for Mage of Prophet to solo even the first dungeons if they arend ahead for at least +5 levels.\n\nEven of this con(Not really a con but lack of friends  who wish to dive in this beatifull and diverse world), I still find this game really entertaining.\n\nThe people here are so generous thet even one complete stranger gave me gold to buy first level of riding skill + mount, which are quite expensive for starters.\n\n\nVerdict: This game is far ahead of it's time.
