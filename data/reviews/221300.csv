Only up to 4 player, yourself plus 1- 3 computer AI. They  just did not put any effort into making this game for the pc. It could have been so much better. Only buy if you are dying to play monopoly and are willing to play by yourself. Also wish it had 1080p option, highest you can set it at is 1680x1050. Runs fine with windows 7 64bit never had a single problem with 33 hours played.

I love to play it, and have owned many copies of the broad game. Additionally I’ve owned several video game versions as well. My recommendation on this game is split, as I will expand upon below. With this version there are several things I'd like to comment on...\n\nPros...\n--Interactive dice roles\n--Animated piece movement\n--Changeable backgrounds\n--Includes two or three of the common/house rules as options\n--The game allows human players to cheat\n--There are several advanced features like statistics on how many times you or another player has landed on a property and probability of it happening in the next roll\n\nCons...\n--No Multiplayer (over the internet, you can play with up to three others on the same computer)\n--Limited to four players whether 3 AI and 1 Human player or 4 Human players the limit is 4 (The board game and several video game counterparts allows for 6-8 players including the predecessor of this version)\n--The Hard level is not Hard enough (In fact it is a joke)\n--Several common/house rules are missing as options (as shown in multiple rule books published by Parker Brothers and/or Hasbro, if you include two or three you should include all)\n--The Community Chest/Chance cards are chosen completely at random every time, so it is possible to get the same card twice in a row or within two or three draws  (something that next to never happens on the board game, but it happens very often in this version)\n--When you change windows off the Monopoly window the game pauses (instead of finishing the moves for the AI players)\n--You always face the red side of the board and the camera jerks around constantly to follow the animation ( additionally there is no free movement to see where opponent pieces are on the board)\n\nIn general as you can see the con list is larger than the pro list, and I could make it larger still. This version of the game is basically just ok. It is a way to pass the time, especially if you like Monopoly. So from that standpoint I would recommend this game.\n\nThere is no challenge to this game though. Whether you are playing on Easy or Hard you cannot honestly tell the difference.  If you want a challenge I suggest an older version of Monopoly called Monopoly 2008 published by GameHouse and TIKGames. It was and may still be available through realArcade. If not there are still copies available through second hand game stores as it was published on CD as well. In my opinion EA/PopCap Games dropped the ball here as they had an excellent start in this older version when they purchased the rights to this game and the Monopoly brand. Monopoly 2008 still is not multiplayer but it has basically all the house rules as options, and the Hard mode is well hard. So from this standpoint I say pass on this game.\n\nAll and all there is plenty of room for improvement here. If this game gets updated to fix some of the cons listed above I will remove this review and give it another chance. Until then I just use this game to play with friends, and ignore the AI. It is the only reasonable use in my opinion of this version. The Previous (Monopoly 2008) version is what I play when I want to play the computer.","October 20, 2014","false","26.7"," 137 of 147 people (93%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","93","137","147","7","0"

At the end of each game, a table of throws shows a natural distribution, more or less, but the timing of when those throws either benefit or hurt you is controlled, without a doubt.  For the "hard" level. it's set on a 1/2 - 2/3 bias; whereby you will make good throws 1/3 of the time, while your computer opponents have good throws 2/3 of the time.

Because I have played other PC Monopoly games before and comparing them but this game a bit boring like most Board Games. The only thing they could of improved is having more player counters like the Cannon, Moneybags, but also I've played a Monopoly PC Game near 1999 published by Infogrames, Developed by Artech Studios who added some interesting National Boards and Currencys like Germany, France, Italy, Spain and many more; along with their original currencies or use Euros, even Pounds or Dollars. Plus the Monopoly from 1999 and 2002 edition developed by Artech Studios had online play, but this Steam Version from EA/Popcap does NOT!\n\nSo that is a no from me, and they should at least put some more effort into it. Maybe make it more "foreign friendly" plus Multilingual - like the those National Boards or even those Special Limited Editon ones as a DLC, and a bit more common sense for pleasing players. Afterall we want PC Board Games less boring then the actual real Board Games.\n\nBut seriously this is almost the same to those ordinary real life Board Games, and its a waste of money to me. EA need to put some effort and common sense on publishing games and find the best Games Developers. I am not kidding you - this game deserves FAR much better than this.\n\nIf Steam will release like Monopoly Deluxe, I seriously hope they get more than 10 Gold Tokens, as well have more Chance Cards, Community Chest cards for more various opportunities. And provide wide range of board or background customisation, to spice things up as well as Steam Achievements, Trading cards and top notch DLCs.","December 10, 2013","false","0.9"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","25","32","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fxfighter/recommended/221300/","Fxfighter","Vilde Stormark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fxfighter/","412 products in account","Monopoly with fancy graphics. You are able to play against 3 opponents. They are either controlled by a ai or yourself. There´s no online multiplayer. There´s no option to change the language.\n\nThe boardgame revolves around trading properties.  Everything works fine except for one thing.... the ai. The ai never propose a deal in your favor. The ai consistently give eachother what they want for no cost. Games at a higher difficulty becomes a race against the clock. It´is not unusual for the ai to have a hotel before you hit the start tile for the fourth time in the hardest difficulty. As soon as one ai get a few buildings up, the rest of them goes bankrupt to that ai.\n\nThe ai is so simple in this game that the game itself loses it´s replayability. Each game feels the same, there's no twists or new situations. There's just one pattern for the ai to use and it shows.\n\n\nThe whole game feels like a moneygrab.  It´s probably beacuse it lacks the two things you would want from a Pc version. A online multiplayer and a proper Ai. You have to play against real people at your Pc to make this game fun. I would rather buy a physical copy in that case.","January 2, 2014","false","1.5"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

The A.I doesn't just set values, it does negotiates and even cuts slack from time to time.\n\nBut the game is far from polished. Unfortunately I have encountered bugs of one kind or another. one inparticular which destroyed the flow of the game is when the mouse cursor freezes while trying to roll the dice. It's endlessly frustrating to sit there at the start of my turn waiting for my mouse to unfreeze so I can take my turn. Unfortunately this bug alone is enough to stop me playing and quit to play something else.\n\nOne of the biggest problems, and this is something I see meantioned over and over, is the games lack of multiplayer options. For a board game designed originally to be played entirely by people it seems odd that it only offers limited multiplayer from the same computer. Considering right now that free to play counterparts to monopoly already offer this feature on a truely massive scale, this is something the game severely lacks.\n\nIn short if you are looking to buy this game to play with your friend, don't. You are far better off saving your money and buying the actual board game. There is no online play option and as far as game play goes this version of monopoly only really offers an A.I to play with. Really your just paying for animated pieces and some flashy screen splashes.","June 28, 2015","false","1.6"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","23","30","2","0"

I haven't expirenced any crashes whatsoever playing in fullscreen in all and the only bug I found was when I picked up the dice to shake them I guess I also clicked on manage and then the game wouldnt let me do anything but to fix it I just pressed esc then alt+tab went back into the game and then saved and exited and started back up and it kept working.\n\nNow for its Pors and cons\n\nPro's\nGreat game\nFrom what I've expirenced barly any crashes or bugs\nGood Graphics\nReally nice fair AI with diffrent difficulty settings\nCustomizable game rules\nGood options menu\nCustomizable meaning you can change the color on the dice (mine being rainbow) and you can change the music.\nRuns smooth\nYou can run this on a computer/laptop not built for gaming and still have it play smooth.\nHours of fun\nStatistics for a lot of things in game\nCan play with up to 4 players or 4 bots\nAnimations look nice\n\nCons\nfrom what I hear in the fourms there is bugs (idk if it was updated or its because they're are using a diffrent version of windows then me I use windows 8 and it plays fine)\nIt doesn't support online multiplayer\nChaning the languages from what I hear is a pain in ♥♥♥\nHotseat game\nLosing makes you mad\n\nAnd thats about all\n\nSo I would recommend this game for a cheap 10.00's if you have the money sure personally I got it because it was on sale for either 5.00 or 2.50. The game plays really nice and is set up really nice. The thing I hate is people say things like "Well why not just go play the actual game if its hotseat" Well my answer is because Monoply is so borning in rl having to count numbers do math run out of money, end up losing your tokens, cards, and money for the game. And deal with cheating while in vitural monoply its automatic its great! The bots play as well as actual players and playing on hard can be quite a challange while easy can be a nice laid back have fun type of mode. i recommend getting this game full price if you have the money but if your conservitive get it on sell cheap. That's just my opinion I love this game its great  and I reccomend to getting it regardless with no online multiplayer. my only complaint is no steam trading cards or achivements but that doesnt matter still a great game. Like I said a couple times already I reccomend getting it BUT the choice is yours in the end","March 28, 2014","true","22.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There is no online multiplayer but it does have local multiplayer.  It's good for someone like me who doesn't really care about online play for a game like this.  It also lets you play the game fast pace because you can quickly skip through the computers turns and then get back to making your moves.  No more waiting for that one pesky player that just wont go, and no worried about someone online going AFK for long periods of time.  If this sounds like something you would desire from a game this is a good pick (I travel a lot for work and it is a nice game to play when I am sitting on a cramped air plane, I have even played with other passangers I meet sitting next to me).  If this game sounds like you I would also recommend picking up the game of Risk on here as well, it is a very similar setup as this game. If you just want online play then your going to be disappointed and I would recommend avoiding this game.","November 29, 2014","true","19.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Although it's accurate to the boardgame and works in the sence that you can win the game, it's impossible to follow what is going on. All through the game there are board movements and amounts coming up in the screen. In-game popups block the board partially and make it difficult to find the opponent pieces on the board. The settings don't let you change the unwanted visual effects. It does however let you change the colour of the dice. (?!?)\nI find myself going back to the event log to see what happened, who rolled the dice and why a certain amount flashed across the screen. Infogrames made a better version back in 1999. This version allowed a 2D-view of the board that allowed you to keep a good overview of the positions of the pieces, which is really helpful when making tactical decisions like when to invest in a monopoly.","May 28, 2014","false","14.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Nothing but negative, negative, negative.  even so, I was still lacking a PC port of my all time favorite game, so I bought into it anyway.  Surprisingly, I wasn't disapointed.  I wasn't scratching my head at the UI trying to figure it out, I wasn't holding my ears shut from some horrible music theme, I wasn't slamming my head into my desk at the consistant crashes, none of it.\n\nInstead, I was quite pleased at the little game.  It's nice, easy to work, has low system requirements, doesn't seem at all buggy, and it's just the same as I've always remembered it.  You can change the background for atmospheric effects, set your own house rules, and play with up to 4 players, all AI or human.\n\nI suppose one thing people are mad at is no online multiplayer, it's hot-seat only, witch is rather disapointing.  Of course, I never really play multiplayer online anyway, so it's not an issue for me.\n\nOverall though, I'd say it's worth the buy if you're in need of a PC Monopoly port.  It's simple, low requirements, small, practically plug-and-play, and has enough that'll keep me coming back for a long time.

The ai will also freely trade properties to try and get any of it's pieces a monopoly, and it will give you any roll that is needed to land on those specific properties while keeping it's precious pieces off of any monopoly you own. The piece(s) that has (have) the monopoly will commonly spend all it's (their) money to get a hotel, but that's fine because even on medium difficulty the ai pieces cannot be banrupted as long as there is only one human player unless it is to another ai piece.

I just had two AI trade Connecticut Ave (giving the other the monopoly) for States Ave (no opportunity to build) one-for-one.  Nothing to sweeten the deal, just an even trade.\n\nHad the same thing happen in a previous game when AI traded Boardwalk for Marvin Gardens + $2.  Gave both the chance to build.  WTF?\n\nWith the cards, AI-drawn cards generally earn them money or properties, while player-drawn cards seem to cost money every time.\n\nBest advice is to get a minimum of one of each color early.  When someone owns ONE of a color you don't, trade for money and keep it. if they get two, they'll never give you one for anything other than a rediculous amount of cash, or  something on which they can build. Otherwise the AI will trade-f#ck you.\n\nThe only thing religious on Christmas in my family is our love of Monopoly with NO house rules, and the crap I'm seeing with the AI here is so absurd, even the worst players in real life wouldn't do.  I'm no sore loser, but it takes the fun out of it completely.","March 27, 2014","false","6.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Increasing difficulty results in cheated dice rolls, and trades that only serve to hinder the human player. Too many times have absurd trades been made between AI opponents that serve no purpose other than to make the game "difficult". I understand that HARD should be just that, but it should remain at least reasonable. The camera angles are weird. It should support up to at least 6 computer players. The interface is clunky. The graphics and animation are fine, music is not annoying, and house rules are interesting but unnecessary. As someone else pointed out, Chance and Community Chest cards are not put into a discard pile but instant recycled leading to mupltiple draws of the same card back to back quite frequently (which should almost never happen).

Despite the game's flaws, it is genuinely one of my favorite board games. Unfortunately, this particular version of it is rather poor.  It maxes out at the weird resolution of 1680 x 1050. What kind of resolution is that? Do they even sell monitors in that size? Why would a game released in 2012 not allow you to have regular 1080p? Also, the sound effects cut out after a single turn, leaving you with just the music. Also, you can only have four players, while the board game, and numerous other computer editions allow for six. The presentation is bare-bones and the environments are mostly pretty ugly.\n\nIf you want a truly great version of Monopoly for PC, go on Ebay or Amazon and track down the version from 2000 by Hasbro Interactive. That game has:\n* Support for 6 players\n* Fun Voice-overs\n* Cool animations\n* Good looking art style, despite the game's age\n* Custom Board Designer\n* A catchy theme song\n* Feels more alive in general\n\nA new company recently appeared and seems to be doing new versions of Hasbro board games that had previous versions on Steam. Hopefully they'll reach Monopoly, because the PC deserves a good, Modern Monopoly game.","February 5","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I admit it's lazy on my part but I prefer the compter version because my friends and I tend to simplify the math by rounding and it gets a little crazy after a while. This has the added benefit of allowing you to have AI players along with your friends so you can gang up on the AI and work together rather than against each other.\n\nThe dice mechanics are neat as well as the "roll for me" option. I also love that you can allow cheating in the game. (You can choose 1 dice roll and pay half of rent once in the game if you allow cheating.)\n\nOverall a great game for solo play or with friends.","November 5, 2013","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good graphics and pleasant animations. My main gripe is the sound.  Its not bad its just very loud in places; when you start a new game there is a reallay stupid, really loud noise.\nAnyway the game is good and fun to play.  Good against AI players with the levels of play ok.  Although the easy is too easy and the hard is pretty much impossible.\nI feel that there are too many animations in the game and sometimes it can take an age between goes but all in all its a good version of a classic game.  I got it cheap in the last steam sale but even at regular price of £6.99 is still worth it.\nCome on lets play Monopoly.....\n","March 17, 2014","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
