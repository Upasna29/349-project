Yes\nDoes this make it a bad game? No.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pxfJf2ARZM\nGreen meanies have invaded the planet and it's up to you, the bulb brothers to put a stop to it. Using 'slingshot' abilities and the laws of physics to attack and destroy everything in sight. If you are familiar with angry birds series (who isn't?) you'll know what to expect.\n\nStay Alight includes 80 levels spread across 4 distinct zones. Each zones artstyle is themed differently and get more difficult as you progress, introducing new game mechanics, ammunition and enemies. While the difficulty increased rapidly, you could jump between the zones if needing a break from the current puzzle. Not sure if the art was hand drawn but it's got a lovely steampunk style.\n\nMouse controls were decent, simply left click then drag for shot power then release. So it's a game that could be played when doing other things. One minor issue, clicking too fast after completing a shot seemed to cause the next projectiles  range and power to get 'stuck' and for the life of me could not find a cancel shot button.\n\nOverall it's a family friendly game that will get you thinking, includes a bunch of content, decent soundtrack and the price is spot on.

The dudes with lightbulbs for heads look pretty neat and there's a nice splashing of colour, it made a great first impression.\n\nThe mechanics involve aiming your character (a dude with a lightbulb for a head) to throw an object to kill some little green monsters.  So it's all about power and trajectory.  Excellent!!  I really like these type of games.  I used to love playing that tank game where you try to kill your buddy/cpu by aiming your turret over a mountain and taking chunks out the landscape!!\n\nSadly, the mechanic is broken...  I think what is happening is when the mouse pointer moves off from the screen it doesn't allow you to change power or trajectory, fixing you on the last angle before you left the screen.  If you need to increase your angle or power at this point, you can't.  Or if you can it's gonna be fiddly.\n\nThe other thing, the fps drop and I had big lag spikes.  I'm using 970/i5 and this is a static screen with a couple of moving sprites.  Obviously some bad code.\n\nMakes me cry a little inside when I see something like this.  Good concept and nice looking graphics destroyed by game breaking bugs.  If the dev/s ever fix these issues, I'd come back and recommend this in an instant.  As it stands I'd advise to avoid it unless you think you can put up with these poor issues.\n\nChecking through the forums I notice this from the Dev :-\n\nOriginally posted by Wyse Games:Hi there! We think that we figured out the issue. The patch is coming soon, stay tuned.\nThis was 10 weeks ago.  Maybe there is hope that the game will get a patch to fix the issues.  If so, I'll happily come back and I'm sure recommend the game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/345060/discussions/0/617329505855689819/?tscn=1447451684#p1","August 19, 2015","false","3.5"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","30","40","0","1"

The mouse sometimes doesn't want to reverse your character to shoot backwards, making for a few frustrating, showing that this is a port from a phone.  Don't let that scare you off.  The music is nice, the graphics are pretty, and the challenge of getting three stars in just a few shots or finding a puzzle piece can be satisfying.  For under $4, I'd certainly recommend this game.","March 2, 2015","true","0.3"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","25","32","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rph133/recommended/345060/","rph133","Skye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rph133/","790 products in account","PROS:\n*Good use of physics\n*Unique "second character" mechanic\n*Feasible achievements\n\nCONS:\n*Finicky mouse control\n*Unique mechanic underused\n*Projectile variety largely meaningless\n*Not very "puzzly"\n*Some potential slow-down in later levels\n\nGAME LENGTH:\nAchievement hunters should expect to be done in around 6 hours.  Those who just want to complete the game should expect to take around 5.\n\nSCORE:\n6 out of 10\n\nI didn't expect much from this game, so I was surprised to find myself enjoying it as I played through the first world.  However, somewhere in the middle of the second world, I began to have nearly constant trouble controlling the power and direction of shots, as if the game were fighting me.  This is perhaps related to its mobile origins, but whatever the cause, it quickly spoiled my experience.\n\nUnfortunately, by the end of the second world, I also began to tire of the game because of a lack of variety and puzzles.\n\nThere is some effort at adding variety:\n\n(1) Different spark types\n\nThese include sparks that explode after three bounces, roll upon contact with a surface, split into two upon contact with a surface, burst into a cross formation after some time, or split into three immediately.  I didn't find that the exploding or rolling sparks were really any more useful than the normal spark, except in those rare instances where they alone could kill the enemies.  The cross spark's burst, being out of the player's control, was too unreliable.  And while the splitting sparks offered a chance to kill more enemies at a time than a single spark, it was not always clear where they would go after the split.  I am not really a fan of Angry Birds, but that game does a much better job of making use of its unique projectiles.\n\n(2) Enemies who move, fly, or teleport\n\nSince the enemies in games like this are really only targets, I don't expect much variety from them.  However, in what I feel to be the absence of meaningful variety in spark types, the lack of variety in this category stands out as well.  Moreover, all of the mobile enemies in this game are capable of moving through or behind walls where sparks cannot reach them.  This means that the player has to wait for them to come back out, which can make some levels tedious.  Perhaps the worst offender is the teleporting enemy, who can reach inaccessible locations and reappear in those same places again and again.  I once saw such an enemy reappear in the same place four times in a row, forcing me to wait.\n\n(3) Obstacles like electricity, portals, spinning blades, and walls that open when a button is pushed\n\nThe electricity and blade obstacles destroy your sparks.  For the most part, they are used satisfactorily, though sometimes the delay between the electricity being on and off is too long and the blades are very rare.  The portals only really show up in the last world, so you won't get to deal with them unless you play to the end.  With the exception of maybe two levels, these are used satisfactorily as well.  The buttons, unfortunately, can be very frustrating:  once pressed, they can be pressed again, which turns whatever mechanism they operate back off.  When buttons are put in cup-shaped spaces, this often means that a spark that lands in the cup will hit the button, then bounce back and turn it off.  Managing to hit a button only once (or three times) in these cases always felt like a matter of luck.\n\n(4) A second character who can catch the first character's sparks, then throw them\n\nThis was a very good mechanic, but it was under-used.  It should have been a more central mechanic to distinguish this game from others.\n\nTo recap, this game features a unique but underused mechanic, an underused or occasionally frustrating set of obstacles, a limited set of enemy types with a frustrating ability to hide, underwhelming projectiles, and few "puzzles" that take advantage of those projectiles' unique traits.\n\nAdditionally, the fourth world drastically increases the difficulty.  I aimed to achieve 3 stars on every level (awarded, I think, for completing a level with at least 2 sparks remaining) and had an easy time of it for the first three worlds, but then gave up on doing it on a couple levels in the fourth world due to its difficulty spike.  Some of those levels involved very difficult shots with no room at all for error.  Fortunately, there is no achievement related to getting all 3 stars in the final world, perhaps in recognition of this difficulty.\n\nSpeaking of achievements, these are all pretty easy to get.  There is only one that I had to "grind" to receive:  fail 100 times.  Since I was aiming for the 3-star achievements anyway, I knew if I would be unable to complete a level before I officially failed it.  It was much faster to simply refresh the level than to throw my remaining sparks and wait for the failure animation and screen.  This meant that, by the end of the game, I had under 5 of the required 100 failures.  If you are an achievement hunter and you play this game, remember to take the extra time to actually fail.\n\nFinally, in the fourth world, I noticed that the game would occasionally hang as a result of all of the animations, particularly when portals and electricity were abundant.  I easily meet the recommended requirements for this game (as should anyone at this point), so this shouldn't have been a problem.\n\nOverall, I give it a 6/10.","May 21, 2015","false","6.4"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","20","24","0","0"

At face value it's rather well done, looks fantastic and has pleasant music. Play more than 10 levels, though, and you'll find a shallow, boring and poorly catered game. The puzzle aspects are poorly done and most levels are really just boring and unimaginative.\n\nAll the parts of this game are fantastic but it's unfortunate that the sum of them is done fairly poorly and in uninteresting ways.\n\nAlso, performance issues galore with this mobile port. Be it from levels and cutscenes randomly not displaying to major CPU throttling and slowdown within the game. They're so random it's difficult to pinpoint the cause but are prevalent enough to issue a warning against.\n\nThere are worse games than this and this game is serviceable but in the end it's not really worth your time.","September 11, 2015","false","3.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The graphics are good enough but that is about all it offers.  Gameplay is repetitive with basic trial and error or take a random shoot approach. 5/10","October 15, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is the same with different levels and extras of course.\nThe artwork is sooooooooooooo good. And the soundtrack is perfect aswell.\n\nThe negative part of it is a mouse bug when playing. But you can easily find a shortcut to end it.\n\nThe game has achievements (easy to do in 100%) and i get it on sales but its totally worth the 4€.\nGreat job :)","October 11, 2015","true","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can't lower the volume.\nThere is an achievement list. If you click on one of those achievements, then you will get a hint/tip on how to get.\n\nMain menu music is okay.\n\nAbout the game.\nYou are a guy that shoot a nice light thing and you have to hit those green slimes. The game reminds me somewhat from "angry birds". You have limited light bullets in order to take down those slimes. In some levels you are even able to find  piece of puzzles.  There are alot of levels and The light bullets are able to bounce from the walls and ground. Whenever you are launching a light bullet, you will see the angle of your last shot which is really handy. Whenever you are trying to launch a shot, you will see an angle which helps you for firing. You can also get Stars 1-3 but i mainly think its for highscore purposes. Some enemies can walk behind the structure or teleport away to a different location.\n\nMusic is somewhat disruptive but okay. Doesn't have alot of variety.\nSometimes the cursor angle could be laggy or getting really weird.\nThe shot angle is like a grenade throw from the game "Worms".\n\nOther things.\nSometimes laggy moments.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 7/10\n","April 14","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
