This isn't a problem if you have three friends to play with, but given this game's unpopularity, chances are you'll be playing with at least one bot, and you won't be able to fathom how mind-blowingly stupid they can be. They stare at walls during battle, stand in front of gunfire, run into crowds of zombies and spray you down with first-aid when you have so much as a paper cut. Occasionally they'll shoot at the enemy to little effect. I say little effect because most of these enemies (humans included) seem to be able to absorb a hail of bullets into their faces and shrug it off.\n\nAwful AI aside, the game is rife with bugs, clunky controlling and horrible gameplay mechanics. There's also a noticeable lack of atmosphere for a franchise which usually NAILS level design.\n\nMy advice, if you're adamant on buying this, is to wait for a Steam sale.","January 6","false","14.4"," 125 of 153 people (82%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","82","125","153","11","3"

Also for me finally being able to play as Umbrella and playing through franchise events through their perspective is a joy.\n\nHowever if STEAM Reviews could be either rated as Positive/Neutral/Negative vs. just the choices of Positive/Negative I would put this review at "Neutral". As fun as this game can be I just can't fully recommend it at this time and here is why....\n\nWhy does STEAM still sell games that have "GAMES For WINDOWS LIVE", the support for that service has been stopped.\n\nWhile there are people that would argue the GFWL service still works as it always has, I will tell you from experience that I have never had any issues until this year.\n\nSometimes this game will launch and work fine, other times it will need you to actually delete a settings file to launch or you will be forced to perform a clean install of the GFWL Client. It can be extremely frustrating and time consuming to resolve. There are people who own this game that cannot play because the game will not launch or it will crash at startup and this all is due to GFWL.\n\nI never had problems with Games For Windows Live until they stopped support.\n\nGFWL works but no one should not have to keep fixing this game or any game to play or just to launch without crashing, that really is just ridiculous. Honestly I wish I could count how many times I had re-downloaded the most current version of GFWL just to perform a fresh/clean install and even then the there was no guarantee that the game would work. Sometimes you will find that you might have to go to My Documents (C:\Users\Daniel\Documents\CAPCOM\RERC) and delete the Settings File just to get the game to launch without crashing, again this can be a frustrating experience.\n\nIf you decide to buy just understand what you may be getting yourself into, but also know that with the frequent STEAM sales you can get the complete pack for a very sweet price.\n\nI did finally get this game running and it seems stable, I am running Windows 8.1, this is what I did;\n\n•	Download and install " Windows Essentials "2012"\n\n•	Go to your Control Panel and uninstall "Microsoft Games For Windows Marketplace" and also uninstall "Microsoft Games For Windows- Redistributable" then shutdown and restart your PC.\n\n•	Download the most up to date GFWL, but before you install you need to right click on the file and set the file to run as the Administrator and set the file compatibility to (Windows 7)\n\n•	After the Install restart your PC once again, then sign into "Games For Windows Marketplace" at least once with a valid username and password or create one @ https://login.live-int.com/int.com/.\n\n•	Set the STEAM (EXE) to run as the "Administrator" and set the compatibility to (Windows 7)\n\n•	Download and install "Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City"\n\n•	Before you start the game go to the game folder and set the GAME (EXE) to run as the "Administrator" and set the compatibility to (Windows 7) then start the game and play.

Avoid otherwise.\n\nThis game doesn't really have huge issues that can be pointed out easily, just a whole lot of aspects which are either less than optimal, seemingly not very well thought out or just a few years behind in terms of game design.\n\nAt its core it's an alright squad-based TPS, with each team member having a unique class with a bunch of different abilities, although none of them will have a significant impact on the way you play through the campaign.\nThe campaign itself is, just like every other aspect of the game, not bad, but far from stellar. The story is merely there to give you a reason to continue shooting stuff, and apart from a few encounters with the classic cast it's not exactly noteworthy. It's also short: you can count on 3-4 hours for the main (umbrella) campaign and another 3-4 hours for the government (spec ops) campaign. This spec ops campaign is in fact one of my main gripes with the game, as I am under the impression this campaign was initially meant to be a part of the full release, yet was cut out for one reason or another (perhaps it wasn't finished yet?). The other DLC isn't worth having.\n\nWhile the (coop) campaign was seemingly the main focus of the game, there are also a number of versus modes available. These include the standard team deathmatch and the usual RE variations on that same gamemode, most of which aren't really worth playing. In addition, you'll have to put up with GFWL, p2p matchmaking and a small degree of auto aim which they forgot to patch out. Still, you can have some fun in versus, and I personally always found people to play with between 7-9 pm CET.\n\nPerformance-wise it's not very well optimized, on my rig it actually runs worse than contemporary FPS's with all bells and whistles. The controls are a bit clunky in the beginning (could be better with a controller, haven't tried), but you get used to them. That said, I didn't encounter any bugs.\n\nTo conclude I want to point out the almost lamentable level of mediocrity throughout the entire game. It's not bad, the issues aren't huge and if you enjoy the franchise you can certainly overcome them, yet nothing stands out as being good. Therefore, and because of the bad optimization and DLC campaign, I wouldn't recommend buying this unless it's on sale.","December 27, 2013","true","44.6"," 47 of 66 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","47","66","0","0"

The game play is okay but the enemies are kind of boring.  you'll find your self dealing with the same kind of enemies for most of the game and your weapons feel like they lack impact. there are a few parts where you'll be placed in an arean with some kind of objective that will spice things up a bit but mostly its trecking from a to b shooting zombies and the ocasional licker.\n\nThe story is crap.  None of the new characters are really that intresting and the end is horrible.\n\nThere is some fun to be found in multiplayer but there are better games out there for this kind of thing.\n\nBasically this game is not worth full price.

As a third-person action shooter it is pretty solid in my opinion. The campaign was on the short side, but fun nonetheless. You have a very nice selection for a pretty big arsenal of weapons as well as interesting abilities for each character which specialize in a specific field such as your medic, support, and assault type character. Now, I did have a fun time with this title, but I am not blind to the bugs it possesses as well as pretty poor AI. I have never encountered any game breaking bugs, most were just minor nuisances such as getting stuck in some objects or something trivial like that. As for the AI, well, they're pretty dumb. Sometimes they don't move, or just fail to shoot. Not really much of a help, but sometimes they surprise you when you least expect it.  I honestly don't think it is a bad game. It has its problems, but so does every other game. If you want a fun third-person action shooter I'd recommend it. Not at its full price, however, but rather when it goes on sale. Just know it is not a perfect game, but still an enjoyable one. The DLC for this game adds a second campaign as well as more weapons which I recommend purchasing as well.","November 29, 2013","true","12.5"," 48 of 70 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","48","70","0","0"

Well, is it? Do I agree with them?\n\nYes, it is and yes, I do agree. This game....is almost like a joke. A bad joke that is. First, good things. The music is actually pretty amazing, especially the menu song, which is really good to listen to. And I liked the fact that you actually can get infected by zombies, so in order to cure yourself, you need to drink some purple drink. And I liked the fact that you can play with 3 other people. I guess this miserable game is a little bit more enjoyable if you played it with friends.\n\nAnd now onto the issues. optimization. HORRIBLE. This is like one of the worst PC ports I have ever seen. What were they thinking? It is jerky as hell sometimes, even though I am running the game on a medium quality resolution + low settings (I am not the only one complaining, many have reported the same thing on Metacritic). They obviously screwed up big time on the optimization process. Who made this? Amateurs? And my goodness.....the control is terrible. Basically those zombies swarm in, and a bunch of soldiers try to kill you, basically you are sandwitched and required for you to act fast, but the damn control is so bad, I had a hard time aiming and I don't even know if I am even actually damaging the enemy or not, as they are like sponges. I mean, fix the damn control, or do something about that messed up level. You can't even run right past your friends or zombies if they are blocking your way, when you SHOULD be running like crazy otherwise you will die, and this is just irritating as hell. And what's up with the gun shot sounds? Are those toy guns?\n\nAnd this game only has like what, 7 missions? That's it. Way too short, and I only finished 4 of them and did not bother with the rest as it is just irritatingly annoying. The very concept was good, when I heard about playing as the members of Umbrella and fighting against the main characters of Resident Evil like Leon, I thought this game would be an amazing one. In fact, the voice acting is pretty good in this game, and only if the story was as good as it was meant to be, then I may not criticize this much, but pretty much, the voice acting and the music are the only things that I can praise them for. My goodness, Capcom really screwed this one up heavily. I would rather play Ride to Hell: Retribution than to play this, because at least Ride to Hell is actually well optimized, and is still an enjoyable TPS game. But this? is trash.\n\n3.8 out of 10","November 28, 2013","false","5.3"," 94 of 151 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","94","151","0","6"

Yes, it's on GFWL. Yes, the AI is horrible. You probably shouldn't get this game if all you want is single player because the AI will make you want to flip tables and you have three of them on your team.  You should, however, consider getting this game if you have friends to play with, because the coop is a ton of fun. You can move while aiming, lob various kinds of grenades, and you also have the chance to get infected when a zombie melees you which means you need to keep an antiviral on you (and keep an eye on friends if they're starting to turn. Everyone knows real friends kill their zombified friends. It's in the bro code). You can also start bleeding which will attract zombies to you. Mechanics such as these keep the gameplay interesting. The story is obviously not canon but it's a fun "what-if" scenario that features some familiar faces like Leon, Ada, Claire, and Carlos.  Although the characters you can play as (and there are quite a few to choose from, each with their own unique dialoges which adds replayability) are unknowns outside of this game, they all have distinct personalities and back stories. Sadly, a lot of the character details were cut from the game itself (for example, Dee-Ay's name comes the fact that he's actually a gay man and the letters stand for "Don't Ask," referencing the don't-ask-don't-tell policy, and Lupo is the single mother of four children), but they are still fun to get to know.\nOverall, I find the gameplay fun with friends (having all 4 players taken up by humans is amazing, but even playing with just one friend is a fun experience) and definitely recommend giving it a chance. The main game can be found in various corners of the internet for around $10 but the Echo Six expansion cannot be (it has been argued that the expansion is better than the main campaign - whether or not this is true, the main game is short and the expansion is definitely longer and worth playing - you get the first mission free). I personally was not impressed with the DLC weapons and never use them, although the Cowboy Shotgun can be fun to mess with (my favorite load out is Beltway with a Riot Gun and the Sumarai Edge). The skins are nifty and fun if you have $3 to burn (I enjoy letting Beltway show the world his prosthetic leg, for example) but obviously are just skins and can easily be passed up.\nHave fun blowing stuff up, chasing Leon, saving infected friends by killing and reviving them, running from the horde when you're gushing blood, and laughing at the over the top evilness of Umbrella.","January 6, 2015","true","56.4"," 51 of 78 people (65%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","65","51","78","8","6"

Not only is the bleed mechanic unreliable, but the zombies never stop spawning and would rather attack your team than the spec ops. It's a very flawed mission and pretty much is designed to draw out a very short game by leaving you frustrated and constantly wanting to beat the mission when you aren't equipped to bleed enemies. The game's potential is there but the execution is lackluster and whomever deisgned the bleed mechanic of the game should be fired from Capcom immediately.\n\nAs far as multiplayer goes, it's alright but not very engaging or fun. It's a tacked on multiplayer how it feels and how it was developed. The game is pretty much the co-op experience of the campaign with a tacked on multiplayer but neither seems to be very well developed or thought out as you're constantly running out of ammo from weak guns for the second half of the game.\n\nUnless you get this game for extremely cheap (less than 5 dollars) you're better off spending it on a game with more replayability and a better story (if it has a campaign).","February 19, 2015","false","4.1"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","22","39","4","0"

I actually got it to start up without a hitch, but when I saw it was stuttering just turning around with nothing attacking us, I pushed down the graphics as low as it would go, leaving the resolution at native.  It helped, but things still weren't smooth.\n\nI'm not one of those people insisting that Resident Evil stay true survival horror.  I liked RE5 and Revelations. But this... this doesn't even pretend to be horror.  It's like Left 4 Dead, except everyone, human and zombie alike, is a bullet sponge.  Half the time, I wasn't even sure I was hitting them.  Equally bad, there was often no indication that you'd actually killed them.\n\nWhoever designed the port UI needs to be beaten.  Q is now the physical attack?  And what the hell am I supposed to do when a zombie grabs me?  The screen shows a "C" key, but with a double-headed arrow above it.   Should I press C?  Move my mouse back and forth?  Both?  Should I waggle the C key back and forth?  Who the f*ck knows?\n\nAnd the arbitrary nature of the boss battles are absolute killer.  Suddenly, I can't turn around?  WTF?  I arbitrarily can't go any further than this point?  Riiiiiight.\n\nAnyway, I got to the Licker battle and finally got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off enough to quit the Campaign mode.

The final level is pretty disappointing, and it doesn't really resolve anything in the end.  I was surprised to find that there is a hidden campaign tucked away that the game barely even acknowledges.  There aren't really any achievements acknowledging it, and you can't continue the campaign from the main menu once you start it.

Thankfully it isn't canon to the series and is a "what if" scenario.\n\nYou're a crack team of Umbrella operatives sent in to Raccoon City to retreve the G-Virus during the events of Resident Evil 2 & 3. There are 6 playable characters and you can customize a 4 man squad... Personally I think it could of did without a few of the classes as they seem to be quite useless for general game play situations... However the online portion (good luck finding people who still play this) might have some use for them.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fairly annoying and cumbersome but once you get used to that, you'll figure it all out. Basically Shotguns and quick firing from your pistol are your friends... which is sad because there's over 40 weapons to unlock, all of which are just garbage when compared to a shotgun or good assault rifle.\n\nIt's damn near impossible to beat the game solo on Professional which is my only gripe... You need a team of 4 people who know what they're doing. So if you intend to get the full experience, make sure you have a full group readily available. After all is said and done it's basically just a grind out to level 98... yes level 98, the year of the original events from Resident Evil.\n\nCapcom messed up by giving the SOCOM guys full reign of this because that's exactly what it is... a dated mess of a game with  a Resident Evil theme.","September 22, 2014","false","11.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

Pretty good graphics\n2. runs well (IF it runs at all - had an issue where it crashed to desktop every time I launched and one where it refused to launch), you get to pick from a variety of classes/characters\n3. The enemies are kind of cool, as are the chapters. I like the environments. This game is aesthetically pleasing.\n\nCons:\n1. This is my #1 biggest complaint for this game: you are playing COMPETITIVELY AGAINST YOUR FRIENDS. And it actually hurts your progress. I play this game with my boyfriend. I generally get the first few shots in and he comes along and steals them. He ends up with over 100 kills, I end up WAY beneath my target kills. He gets 15000 xp, I get 1/5 of that. He gets to buy awesome guns and skills. I get to buy nothing, chapter after chapter after chapter. First come first serve for bonus XP like data collection and camera destruction. He plays the guy that can easily see it, runs around and collects it all, I get nothing. This con alone is enough to make me not recommend this game to anyone. This is literally the one thing I cannot stand about certain games. There is NO reason to make a competitive co-op game. I'd be better off playing with the stupid AI, because then at least I'd get XP to progress. However... I don't play single player games very often. I hate them. I don't like playing by myself, but in this game you are forced to.\n\n2. I hate how you can only carry two weapons and that a pistol is mandatory. Coming from other RE games (like RE5) this doesn't sit well with me. I hate being forced to use a pistol. Yes, I most likely would pick a pistol, but I'd like to have the OPTION to use a machine gun instead of it.\n\n3. I think the collision barriers are WAY off at certain positions/times. I constantly have issues with my character's shots getting clipped by imaginary objects. I am clearly hitting him in the center of his chest. There is nothing blocking us in between. Why is he not dying??????\n\nI'm playing this game because my boyfriend likes it. Otherwise I would not be playing and would consider this game a waste of money. If you have an issue with some of the cons I've listed, I honestly wouldn't buy it unless you are getting a super good deal. Don't pay more than 5 bucks.","June 26, 2014","false","5.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The only problem I find with it, (and although it's just one problem, it's a HUGE one!), is that you can tell that this was a hastily done port of the console version. The game has a terrible framerate, during cutscenes and gameplay, that is absolutely unbearable and impossible to enjoy. Believe me, I'm a guy that can stand choppy framerates, if it's at a lag that's bearable and not detrimental to the enjoyability of the gameplay. However, also believe me when I say this game is pretty much impossible to play, even on low graph settings. Therefore, we can also tell that this game was not only poorly ported, but poorly optimized, as well. This doesn't really surprise me too much considering Capcom assigned this project to a third-party game dev company. Nonetheless, I do not recommend this game!

I don't think this would be much fun alone.\n\nNow the game suffers from some terrible fps drops, I mean, the main menu runs at 20 fps.. And the game itself runs at a stable 60. Only drop in game has been on a level with an entire building on fire.\n\nThe AI is not very smart but then again, they are zombies. The human AI is a bit better but no where near good. This does allow for some hilarious moments if you share them friends. The postivite here is that the games does not allow you to run and gun. If you run in the open with humans firing at you, you will die. I like that.\n\nSo should you buy it? Make sure you have at least 2 friends to play it with. Look at the guides to get Windows Live working properly and you should be fine. Also I can run this on Windows 10 64bit without problem... except for the main menu x)\n\nEDIT: 4 hour campaign? I bought this for 7 euros and that included all the dlcs, so I am not mad, but this was originaly sold for 60.

The first level is horriable and it breaks the game and mood for alot of people, myself included, I made myself keep playing and the more the story went on the more fun it became.  The first level is every bland call of duty two weapon loadout you can imagine, you take cover you cannot advance till human enemys are dead, no zombies, no BOWs then you run for the last of it.  This sets the wrong tone for the game and most people don't get past that.  The AI is compatant and forms its own stratagys, anyone can become infected including you, everyone can crowd around and get a hit of first aid spray.  The combat is fun the characters are darkly engaging, and aside from only one major breaking of the time line (We were promised more) the game is pretty solid and alot of fun.  I highly recomend this to anyone provided you can manage to get past the first level.\n\nP.S. As a side note, I don't want my low play time to deter others from this game, I compleated the main campeign on the PS3 version of Resident Evil O.R.C., I bought the steam version on a sale in order to enjoy the DLC that came with it and couldn't enjoy it due to it requirng something of a more 'high end PC' to play it.  I have played the game to compleation on another platform and I wanted others to enjoy it aswell!","October 31, 2013","true","0.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

However, five minutes into the game and you immediately regret playing it, like me.\n\nI gave the game a choice though and played through many more hours of the game and I came to a conclusion.\n\nDon't ever touch this game. Don't ever buy it. Not even on a sale. Not even for completionist sakes. I've been a fan of the Resident Evil series for a while now and I am advising anyone and everyone to stay away from this game.\n\nI would hate for someone with no experience with the Resident Evil series to think that this is how a Resident Evil game plays. It doesn't. The cover system is awful, you're constantly being shot at and can't stop it in anyway possible. The game splits you up into different character roles that have little to no differences between eachother. (Except The Medic and Spectre).\n\nThe worst part about this game is that even if you were to find any enjoyment in playing this game co-op with your friends, which I think might be possible, the game runs through Windows Live. Yeah. The same Windows Live that hardly ever works for online play.\n\nThe music is at least decent in the game but it doesn't really make you want to play the game. It's not eerie or captivating like the other Resident Evil titles.\n\nThis is what is killing a once great game series. This game has no horror elements. It would be better as a light gun shooter than a third person action game. If you have never played a game in the Resident Evil series, I would advise you play Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 5, or even Resident Evil: Revelations. All of those games have superior gameplay, story and are actually fun and scary.\n\nStay away from this game for your own well being. This is an example of Capcom trolling it's fanbase.","January 13, 2014","false","28.5"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JayDehmos/recommended/209100/","JayDehmos","Jay Dehmos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JayDehmos/","74 products in account","Nothing beats killing zombies!\n\n-> To master this game, you must complete missions on harder difficulties and try to obtain an S+ ranking on each one of them. To do so, certain item collection, kill count, and time-limit values must be achieved. To know which values you must beat either finish the mission once or just look it up on the internet. (Cmon dude you're sitting, do something.)\n\n-> Story wise, the game makes you review certain bits of the well know Raccoon City story, from different angles, which is pretty cool. The main story spins around Resident Evil 2 (Leon and Claire), while the DLC story focuses on Resident Evil 3 (Carlos and Jill, which are awesome btw).\n\n-> I recommend learning Assault and Survailance for achieving higher rankings, although Recon is pretty awesome too with everything at max level.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Pros: (yay!)\n\n-> I can say I really find the multiplayer mode and the character classes a lot of fun. Each class has its own abilities and passives, which you level with experience gained by playing the game.  Bear in mind you must keep a cool attitude towards people still learning the game and choosing to play via Multiplayer.\n\n-> If you have a couple of friends willing to play a game together, this might do it for you. Try switching roles and checking all the game has to offer.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Cons: (boo!)\n\n-> Has some flaws, you could have more control of your team's characters passives on single player for example. (Like that  mini-map with everything.) Also, I don't get why you don't start with full ammo, and three steps later find ammo just lying on the floor... (Too derp to carry many bullets.) You also fight the punani version of Nemesis. (He literally just stands there and waits to be ♥♥♥♥ed.)\n\n-> The most annoying thing is the Bots AI. If you are playing alone or with fewer than 3 other people, your team's bots will stand in front of you while you try to shoot stuff and as if that wasn't crappy enough, they will complain afterwards. (Louis much?) The Bots will also block your way sometimes on narrow paths, and it can be really annoying.\n\n-> I really feel like the game misses a Lobby Leader and voting system. Sadly, you will sometimes find people who will join your game just to annoy you. You also have no way of knowing what difficulty you're on ingame, so if you make a mistake choosing it, you will have to restart and you might possibly only realise your mistake once you finish the level. (Really annoying when you're going for the Professional difficulty achievements.) Capcom should have added an ingame progress viewer for kills, item collection and difficulty check as well as player's tags. (Why won't you work TABy. QQ)\n\n-> The aiming system is really poor. Bots will get in your way and block your view most of the time.\n\n-> When you die on Multiplayer, you can't leave the game unless your team revives you or the remaining players of your team die. (Oh, the trolls....)\n\n-> The game is missing a push to talk button, you will have to mute your mic if you don't want everything you say to be heard or if you play surrounded by people you live with.\n\n-> The headshot system is kind of buggy, sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt, and while you can headshot a zombie, you can't kill a human enemy with a single headshot. (Go figure...)\n\n-> The DLC could have added a lot more instead of just new characters and a new campaign. The passives, abilities and classes are the same which you inherit from what you previously unlocked and leveled up.\n\n-> Multiplayer is nearly dead (as our decaying buddies we so love to shoot), you won't find a lot of people to play with or against as of late.\n\n-> The Windows Live achievements for the PC versiopn of the game, are only available for the main campaign and the multiplayer game modes. No DLC achieves; just the missions and they already come unlocked at any difficulty. (Rushed much?)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo summarize: (Finish him!)\n\n-> Overall its a fun game, but it can get boring pretty easily. I would recommend you try and play it for unlocking everything that is possible and trying to beat the game on the hardest difficulty you can while getting the best ranking you can get on each mission. I really feel like Capcom rushed this game, it had potential to be a lot better.\n\n->Although it is a beautiful game, graphic wise and it shows Raccoon City with new colours, it feels rushed in soooo many ways.\n\n5 / 10.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(>^wº)> <Useful Stuff> <(ºw^<)\n\nCamera and data guide:\nhttp://www.supercheats.com/playstation3/walkthroughs/residenteviloperationraccooncity-walkthrough02.txt\n\nWalkthrough:\nhttp://www.ign.com/wikis/resident-evil-operation-raccoon-city","April 27, 2013","true","67.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

From what I've played of the Campaign mode it's quite a thrilling game. Quite a selection of weapons to choose from, but sadly you can not upgrade them. It is nice that each member of the U.S.S. has their own unique abilities so that is a plus. A real bummer for those going through the campaign mode if you do not have a Games for Windows Live account, or for some reason your account is broken you will not be able to save your progress. It fully relies on the GFWL to save any single player data Im guessing since it had the option for 4-player co-op.\n\nIf you were looking to play this for its multiplayer modes then I have some bad news for you... Since GFWL has abandoned this game like a stand up on prom night... it's made the multiplayer... well unplayable. Unless the good people decide that developed this game decide to get things switched over so it relies on Valve and Steam more.... I don't see it being played multiplayer-wise for some time...\n\nIn conclusion if you're a bored individual who's looking to pass the time or a RE enthusiast looking to play the story; I recommend the game then. I myself will be giving it a thumbs down rating for its broken multiplayer aspect.","December 11, 2014","false","3.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

Only one of these three is actually useful\n=> One character's abilities are all useless\n=> Levels are not large enough to support four players\n=> Online co-operative suffers from severe connection issues\n=> Unclear mission objectives\n=> Very little penalty for dying\n=> Can't decide whether it's a serious story arc like Gears of War or an arcade shooter like Left 4 Dead\n=> Each character has identical stats\n=> You can unlock the best weapons almost immediately\n=> Unfair enemy AI\n=> Promised greater interaction with canon characters\n=> Promised greater choice\n\nAesthetics:\n=> Each area recycles models and textures from the first level or two\n=> At least half of the female characters (who are supposed to be professional soldiers) wear inappropriate uniforms for combat\n=> No diversity in character shape\n\nStory:\nThere isn't one\n\nVerdict: Feels unfinished.

This really does give a different perspective to the Resident Evil sotry as a whole which I enjoyed.\n\nRelating to the gameplay issues people are having:\n\n- There was not one single game crash when I launched the game or during playing the game through.\n- There are no bugs during the game either, everything runs smoothly.\n\nThe game overall was exciting as you can upgrade your character and unlock new weapons, abalities etc... During the actual missions there is a lot to do in terms of finding collecatables etc which for me extended the gameplay time as well.\n\nMaking a quick point on the DLC content, I had NO ISSUES!!!! I bought the DLC add-on and the extra ECHO SIX missions were there, all new added costumes and weapons as well.\n\nIn conclusion and not to give too much away story wise, I would recommend this game with a double thumbs up to any Resident Evil fan out there!","March 26","true","10.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Despite the negative reviews, I thought this game would be worth giving another chance with expansions...\n\nI was wrong...\n\nThe moment I turned the game on, a lot of popups were asking me to make a Windows LIVE account (which I found out was the same thing as an Xbox LIVE account).  I make one with fake info, not disclosing my personal info.  It then proceeds to verify my email.  Then expects me to restart my computer... and the steps go on and on...  This is way too much of a hassle to play any PC game!\n\nIf you really want to play this game, get the console version.  The PC version is too much of a hassle to get running.\n\nEDIT: This game is also unstable on the PC.","March 29","false","15.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Overall Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City could have been a great game. The 4 Player Storyline was awesome and even tho it's an action shooter instead of survival Horror it was fun because with 4 players this fits more. The mechanic that you can actually get infected is great and the fact that we're having the antivirus makes sense as well because we're from Umbrella. Unfortunately the game was really poorly made and this is why it sucks so hard. Of course there's still the online mode and the dlc missions but I never liked the online mode of Resident Evil.\n\nI bought the game for 5,59 so I don't really care that it is such a bad game. I will still give this game a YES because I just love the Resident Evil franchise. The game could have been so good, sadly they ♥♥♥♥ed it up real hard.\n\n5/10","March 28","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

It was boring, and I didn't like the way it was set up, But their was one good thing about this, it was the story of it, or at least what I heard of it.

While the concept is good, the execution is fairly lackluster, marred by flaws in control schemes and gameplay issues. For example, your character has the option to do a running dive by sprinting and pressing the action key and in no way is this ever useful in the game whatsoever except to make you look like a goof while you try and grab that much needed healing item and die for the umpteenth time.\n\nMost of the enemies tend to follow the bullet sponge style of difficulty regardless of whether you are shooting them in their weak points, meaning you have to have a team of fairly competent and focused people to clear harder areas. To add insult to injury, the AI is dumb as toast and the networking is dependant on GFWL which is probably one of the worst frameworks for online play you can find. Other typical issues from previous games present themselves in this series such as not being able to shoot through certain obstacles with clear gaps in them and other somewhat ridiculous engine-related restrictions.\n\nI can't really recommend this one especially since GFWL is pretty much on the way out. While I salute Capcom for making an honest try at a co-op game, this attempt fell completely flat.","July 31, 2015","false","5.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","7","15","3","0"

Between the dull and bland characters, the poorly implemented "Gears of War" esque gameplay, sound design that is all over the place, and a plethora of bugs, RE:ORC is not so much a game as it is an excercise in self torment.\nMy friends and I each bought this to play together over a year ago when it was last on sale, essentially as a group suicide pack, and we were not disappointed on that end. Playing with friends alleviates some of the problems, since a bad game can at least be comical when played as a group, but it also introduced another problem in the form of enemy health multipliers. With four players, some enemies can take an absolutely broken amount of punishment, even when all of you focus fire on one at a time.\nThe DLC is just as bad, and includes its own set of bugs, including not selecting the next stage, changing the difficulty at random, and at times straight up crashing when your team is killed.\n\nDo NOT buy this under any circumstance, as you would be better off flushing your money down the toilet.

One plus is that the MP has different game modes that are alot of fun (Using CoD Names: Search and Destroy, Capture the Flag) among others. The PC port is very well done, getting 120+ FPS all the time with absolutely no drops. In my opinion it was very well worth the sale price of $20 for the complete package.","December 27, 2012","true","20.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The main story isn't that long its about 4-5 hours max and no one hardly plays the multiplayer, good luck finding a game to play online. The main story takes place around the same time as resident evil 2 and 3 in raccoon city. There is only a few bosses battles classic enemies like nemesis, tyrant, william birkin. Although this is not resident evil's strongest effort, its still really enjoyable for even the most causal of zombie fans.","April 2, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's fun to play with your friends and it's nice to see other side of things around Raccoon City.\nPeople like to call this "a great action game based in Resident Evil but a bad Resident Evil", but most people do not realize that this game isn't canon and the events here are not part of the original RE timeline, it's just a "what if" games showing Umbrela's side of the Raccoon City outbreak.\nThe Games for Windows Live is the main issue here, it's broken and particularly worse if you use Windows 8+.\n\n\nI do recommend this game, should it ever go on sale (which is hard to happen), try to get it for you and a couple of your friends, you'll have lots of coop gun together.","June 21, 2015","true","21.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'll admit that the game wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be, but it still sucks... a lot.\n\nThe graphics are poo, the shooting mechanics are rubbish, the AI isn't the worst I've seen (still crap), ran into some bugs (I'm talking about glitches, not enemies), and for ♥♥♥♥ sake it uses Games For Windows Gawd Dam Live. I didn't even get the chance to try any online modes due to the fact a gold memebership was required. Thanks, but no thanks. I don't own an xbox and I'm not gonna go gold just for this game.\n\nThe only redeeming factor this game has is the fact that it gives you the chance to shoot zombies while wandering through raccon city once again and I'll admit those moments are the highlights of the game. Those moments don't make it worth it though.\n\nSo yeah, I'm just gonna go ahead and suggest you save your time and money. I can see this being a little more fun with some friends, but there are much better games out there.

The gameplay itself is pretty fun and if you have friends that you can play with it wil be great if you can manage to get this game on sale with the spec ops missions then go for it. The multiplayer is in my opinion the best part of this game with fun game types and then the addition of having zombies running around is great fun and really makes things alot more tense. The game its self when played by your self can be challaging which is nice since most shooters you can breeze throuh. Unfortuantly thats about it I can say about why I like this game\n\nNow for the cons. The story is weak. The really could have got alot more out of it and the ending is just awful with it just cutting to credits from a weak ♥♥♥ end cutscene on top of all that you have to pay for the spec ops missions which should have been included on disk and not some sort of dlc cash in that Capcom are notorious for. Also the campaign is super short clocking in at maybe 3 hours long. Unfortunatly the online multiplayer seems dead (now i only tried queing once but never got a game). Which really sucks cause thats like half this game.\n\nSlant Six has some great ideas but the just dont quiet excute them right. I did really enjoy this game on release (Xbox360) but the lack of people playing online really has me questioning if i should recommend this game.Personally I really enjoyed this game and didnt realise all the flak it got on the time of release but since im writing this review now and not then Im going to have to say I do not recommend getting this game (unless you get it on sale price like I did)","December 3, 2015","false","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay itself is pretty fun and if you have friends that you can play with it wil be great if you can manage to get this game on sale with the spec ops missions then go for it. The multiplayer is in my opinion the best part of this game with fun game types and then the addition of having zombies running around is great fun and really makes things alot more tense. The game its self when played by your self can be challaging which is nice since most shooters you can breeze throuh. Unfortuantly thats about it I can say about why I like this game\n\nNow for the cons. The story is weak. The really could have got alot more out of it and the ending is just awful with it just cutting to credits from a weak ♥♥♥ end cutscene on top of all that you have to pay for the spec ops missions which should have been included on disk and not some sort of dlc cash in that Capcom are notorious for. Also the campaign is super short clocking in at maybe 3 hours long. Unfortunatly the online multiplayer seems dead (now i only tried queing once but never got a game). Which really sucks cause thats like half this game.\n\nSlant Six has some great ideas but the just dont quiet excute them right. I did really enjoy this game on release (Xbox360) but the lack of people playing online really has me questioning if i should recommend this game.Personally I really enjoyed this game and didnt realise all the flak it got on the time of release but since im writing this review now and not then Im going to have to say I do not recommend getting this game (unless you get it on sale price like I did)","December 3, 2015","false","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'll admit that the game wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be, but it still sucks... a lot.\n\nThe graphics are poo, the shooting mechanics are rubbish, the AI isn't the worst I've seen (still crap), ran into some bugs (I'm talking about glitches, not enemies), and for ♥♥♥♥ sake it uses Games For Windows Gawd Dam Live. I didn't even get the chance to try any online modes due to the fact a gold memebership was required. Thanks, but no thanks. I don't own an xbox and I'm not gonna go gold just for this game.\n\nThe only redeeming factor this game has is the fact that it gives you the chance to shoot zombies while wandering through raccon city once again and I'll admit those moments are the highlights of the game. Those moments don't make it worth it though.\n\nSo yeah, I'm just gonna go ahead and suggest you save your time and money. I can see this being a little more fun with some friends, but there are much better games out there. Seriously, this game doesn't do a good job at being a shooter and/or an RE game.","November 29, 2015","false","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The random encounters with Spec Ops in the game also add a bit of warfare into the game.

The story is easily the strongest point, from the moment you're stopping the evil Birkin to protecting Umbrella's name by destroying any claims of wrongdoing.

Also on the harder difficulty settings it can be really hard. Over all it is different enough to play casually, but to master this game would just be plain tedious since the controls and hit collisions is off just enough that it becomes annoying when trying to use precision on more enimies except the bosses, where hit detection works rather well.\n\nI also own this on PS3 and both versions are about the same.

Sure it isn't the best game in the world, and it doesn't encapture that old Resident Evil feel, but let's be real for a minute. Fans of the series who kept on hoping that Resident Evil would re-encapture the horror of the original 3 are going to be sorely dissappointed. The series moved into a more action oriented genre with 4, becoming more action-oriented with each iteration after 4. So the fact that people are acting surprised that ORC was primarily action based need to get a reality check. Comparing this to any other Resident Evil will basically give you the worst impression of all. This was meant to be a completely stand alone title, giving a non-canon hypothetical scenario that takes place between 2 and 3, where you play as the bad guys basically.\n\nAs for the game itself, aside from the terrible friendly AI and GFWL, ORC has some good gameplay to be had. A linear shooter, where it becomes cover-based against humans, and turns into an all out slaughterhouse against zombies, it flips between the two surprisingly well. The story is pretty cheesy and feels a bit half-♥♥♥, but again most of Resident Evil's story telling is not all that exceptional. They all feel like a cheap B movie became a longer than expected series, but never got past its B movie storytelling. But I do cherish that in Resident Evil and can enjoy the stupidity and silliness.\n\nI wouldn't reccommend this game at full price right now, but it is definately worth 10 bucks, especially if you have someone to play with and can deal with GFWL.","December 1, 2015","true","2.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cascade_Range/recommended/209100/","Cascade_Range","Robot Maid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cascade_Range/","359 products in account","Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City is a gaiden game for the Resident Evil series. It's skirts on the "recommend" side of "recommend or not", but only barely. There's quite a few flaws in the game, but it's overall not a bad game.\n\nA bit of background. You play as one of Delta Squad, an elite fireteam in the Umbrella Security Service. From there you take on increasingly harder missions assisting Umbrella in eliminating evidence of their involvement of Raccon City's outbreak and their "morally questionable" practices.\n\nNow this is NOT a bad game. However, if you walk into this game expecting a "Resident Evil" (i.e. survival horror with zombies) game, you WILL be disappointed. If you do not treat this game as a "Resident Evil" game, you will enjoy it significantly more.\n\n\nThe good points,\n\nIt runs on a class system, where there are six classes to pick from (Recon / Demolition / Assault / Sniper / Medic / Scientist), where each class has their own uses and skill sets. Only one of each class can be in the run at any given time, so your team will ALWAYS be missing something. This, in my opinion, is actually good, but can shoo away some people. For example, at some points you run into armed mines. Demolitions are the only "safe" way of effectively dealing with them, but if you don't have a Demolitions, you could be slowed down severely by those mines. If your team is lacking a medic, you will ALWAYS be missing something important. Optimally, you'd set up a fairly balanced team to go into these missions.\n\nThe gameplay is fun. It's not "Holy crap, you have to play this game" fun, but it's fun. It's a passtime and enjoyable enough to play. There are some flaws in the gameplay, but that will be covered in the next section.\n\nNow for the bad points.\n\nIt runs on Windows Live for some reason, so you'll need to get an account there to play the game online at all. It's especially redundant because looking at the grey / black background of this review window should give you the impression you're already on Steam. So why would we need Windows Live? I admit, this is incredibly minor. It's still a minor gripe, nonetheless.\n\nThe AI in general. The AI enemies seem to be programmed as zombies. As a result, most of the enemies will come after human players. AI allies are also really, really, really, REALLY dumb. As a result, I recommend you play this game with AT LEAST 3 people. If you can find 2 other people to play this game with (that can, of course, agree on who will play what role), it'll be a much better experience.\n\nThe cover system. It's terrible and needs a lot. The game is moderately schizophrenic on what qualifies as "cover" and what doesn't. Some "cover" doesn't protect you entirely and it can be a big hassle in the middle of a firefight. This somewhat ties into having more than just one player.\n\nOverall\n\nIn spite of the more "bad points" than "good points", one of the bad points is almost completely negated by having friends you can play with and another is more of a minor inconvenience. If you want to play this game, I would recommend that you wait for a sale and make sure you have a few friends you can play this game with. Even with all the DLC, this game is NOT worth the $40 price tag.\n\nTL;DR - Play with friends, wait for sale.

I can safely say that it’s much better than I expected :) That being said, I can still see why people and critics tore the game apart. It doesn't play like any other Resident Evil game and the attention to detail is lacking.\n\nNothing surprises me in terms of level design, a lot of things look quite samey and there’s a distinct lack of graphical fidelity that Resident Evil 5 had. Gameplay is also somewhat lacking. The guns feel under powered when fighting the various enemies and the weapon firing sounds are among the worst I’ve heard in a game :S I do enjoy the level progression and co-op features which allow you to unlock several new weapons and upgrades for each of the six characters to play as. The Umbrella squad are absolutely bad ♥♥♥ and each character has a unique look and attitude.\n\nThe AI in ORC is terrible. Probably the worst feature of the game. My teammates enjoy running around in an elevator and running straight into enemies line of fire. This of course would be fixed if I was playing online, but I want to have the same quality of gameplay in single player or co-op and not feel more tempted to play one over the other. The co-op can be played throughout the whole game which is probably why the AI is so stupid.\n\nThe enemies are varied and along with Resident Evil classics, there are a few new enemies to fight. The zombies attack in massive hoards sometimes and the human soldiers take cover and lob grenades at you. I can’t really find any problems with this part of the game. Even boss battles are interesting.\n\nOverall the game has that Resident Evil feel, it just doesn't have the best engine or the most well thought out gameplay. The developers should have put more time into the PC version in particular because it definitely feels like a direct port. I mean there’s even an X-Box 360 D-pad icon as part of your HUD where you select different grenades. Performance wise it meets expectations, but I feel it needed some more time to work out where it could be improved. Despite these flaws I’m enjoying this game so far and look forward to experiencing everything Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City has to offer!\n","January 5, 2013","true","4.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I had fun running around, getting ammo, and fighting different monsters in destroyed city areas.  Ultimately it is a glorified story mode versions of "Merc Missions" from RE 4, 5, and DS RE games.\n\nI had fun, could be awesome if I had peeps to play with; but it was a step backwars for Third person action games.

It is based on locations and characters of original series, but remember it is only (and just) a spin-off. It has singleplayer campaign, sure, but do not be fooled - this game is 100% AN ONLINE GAME, SP was added but it is NOT something you want to expirience, it was never meant to be SP and that's final. For hardcore RE fan the game will be good or very good (or awesome with the right people). For others it will just be an average shooter with some RPG elements (unlocking character skills and weapons). Versus multiplayer mode are something new and if you are bored of all the other games of the genre, you will spend few hours here and won't regret it. Game is not ground breaking, graphics are rather bad (for PCs it's like 5 years ago, consoles sux heh) and maps design are average.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/recommended/209100/","DeltaBladeX","DeltaBladeX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/","4044 products in account",""You sure my team aren't zombies?"\nSet in Raccoon City during the events of Resident Evil 2 and 3, this game has you taking your team through streets, alleys and masses of zombies in order to complete your missions.\n\nStory\nYou are part of an elite team sent to Raccoon City by Umbrella to retrieve samples of the G-Virus created by William Birkin. Later missions will have you taking down the power in the city and destroying any evidence about what Umbrella has been doing. Along the way, you will meet some characters you should recognize if you have played the older games. The events of this game are not part of the series though, which does make sense.\n\nPresentation\nThis game is looking great. For a ruined city, this place is perfect. Raccoon City is wasted, just as it should be. Destroyed cars, dead bodies and burning wreckage all over the place. The indoor locations like Umbrella labs also look perfect. Moving onto the enemies, these are also as they should be. The zombies themselves look perfect for what they are.\n\nNow we get to the sound, and that isn't so good. Forgettable music, poor voice acting and lacking sound effects all make me wonder if they tried here. Even the moans just aren't what they could be.\n\nControls\nAs a game developed with consoles in mind, it is best to stick with a gamepad. Even the HUD features a DPad to select your grenades and healing items. Playing with the pad, most of the controls worked decently, though attempting to make headshots with the analog stick was aggravating. More than once, I'd use my mouse to aim for those bits.\n\nGameplay\nThis game takes a massive departure from most of the other titles in the series, being a team based third person shooter with plenty of ammo to let lose at your enemies. Most enemies are bullet sponges though, and it will take time to clean up the mobs in your way. Nothing inspired here, it plays like many other team based shooters, such as the Left 4 Dead series.\n\nThere are six different character classes to pick from, each with their own active and passive skills to level up and use during gamplay, allowing different gameplay styles in your team. You have a Assault member, great with their guns, Demolitions who can set traps, a Medic for healing all your woes, a Scientist who can infect and control enemies, the Recon is all about stealth and finally the Surveillance member for boosting your ability to detect items and enemies.\n\nThe only problem with your team is that they are incredibly stupid, with me left wondering if even the zombie AI is smarter, since that lot don't get lost when attempting to hunt. This is easily fixed by having friends play, but unlike more popular titles, there isn't a lot of players around.\n\nLifespan\nWith a total of six levels, I found this game to be rather short. Once you have beaten the game, you have a few things to do, such as trying to get higher ranks in each level, powering up each of your six characters and finding enough intel in the levels to unlock all images in the Gallery.\n\nThere are a number of multiplayer modes, but like co-op, you aren't going to have many people willing to play with you. I wouldn't depend on that unless you want to gift out several copies to people on your friend list.\n\nThere are also a number of DLCs available, though I'm only going to mention the important ones here, the Echo Six content. This adds additional missions to the Free Play mode, in which you play as another group, working against Umbrella. This group is nothing more than reskins of the original team though, with the same skills available, but the missions themselves are different. If you care for the gameplay, these are worth purchasing.\n\nClosing\nWhile this game is nothing special, I enjoyed it enough that my purchase during a 75% off sale didn't feel like a rip off, as any early buyers would have felt. It has uninspired gameplay and isn't popular enough to fill a team for co-op, but it isn't bad.","August 7, 2013","true","8.6"," 10 of 31 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","10","31","0","3"

However its an almost straight console port with an antiquated GFWL messing with the program (nothing a google search for a fix cannot solve) but it did have trouble appealing to diehard fans of the Resident Evil franchise and thusly is an experience largely overlooked, by no means is this a 'bad' game but it had every opportunity to be so much greater than what it is.\n\nOperation Raccoon City's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness, a non-canonical and self contained story set between the events of much beloved Resident Evil 2 and 3 sees a USS Operative team initially led by HUNK; are taken through the events that transpired to bring Raccoon City to its knees. Initially the story remains on-canon with the rest of the timeline until your team is tasked with wiping out central characters of the Resident Evil franchise, namely Leon Scott Kennedy, Claire Redfield, Jill Valentine and anyone else who happens to wander into your path, this is where the game begins to flounder like a fish trapped in a wine glass. That isn't to say the story is terrible, but it muddies itself with getting involved in 'what-if' scenarios rather than choosing to focus on Umbrella's more devious wetwork conspiracies and opting 'out' to remain behind the shadows. It is because of this the story fails to be anything memorable or meaningful by distancing itself as far away from the canon of Resident Evil as it can which in the end is a great shame for something that had so much potential. Digressing away for a moment however, the very standalone nature of the narrative and its daring to turn away from the fans expectations to offer a new perspective is refreshing and should be commended; after all, there are no cliffhangers or questions left unanswered come the finale and the wake of all your destrution, so it does earn its merits there.\n\nGameplay wise, its a mixed bag of nuts. A four player co-op campaign is there and with friends, its a great experience, a choice of 8 playable characters all with their own individual perks and playstyles can be upgraded through a below average levelling system in which you spend your hard earned XP for weapons, passive or combat skills. The controls are designed for gamepads in mind, the mouse and keyboard setup doesn't really work too well and navigating the environment rests between clunky or fluid. You wouldn't press a button and accidentally do something else but the accurate responses just dont quite hit the mark they should. Your adversaries are lethal bullet sponges and often will take more than a full clip of ammunition to bring them down. With online co-op, coordinated attacks can mean the difference between life and death and this can actually be joyous fun.\n\nAs a single player experience it has the potential to be quite frustrating as your teams AI is lacking in some departments, yet excels in others. For example, they can manage themselves when it comes to healing, shooting or finding the nearest shady spot in an all out firefight but in close range combat they have a hard time deciding whether to go melee or gunsa'blazing, often resulting in their death through lack of final decision.\n\nThe difficulty during missions can spike at key chokeholds found throughout the game, you could be sailing through one moment and suddenly you're watching the load screen time after time wondering what the hell happened? Even on a moderate difficulty setting the game will contest you for dominance, which for some, might be no bad thing; yet for others it will just be an aggrivating nightmare.\n\nAmmunition is always in abundance so the survival horror aspect is largely withdrawn in favour of running and gunning but if you ARE on a higher difficulty setting then you'll see its just as well with my points mentioned above. There is also, in all difficulties a pretty cool feature which can have the player contract the zombifying virus if they absorb too much damage or become infected when heavily bleeding, which puts on a desperate scramble for an anti-viral container to cure yourself before you turn and start eating your friends, all of which are limited in number throughout each chapter of the game. Death is not permenent when playing online with friends but offline, the AI are incapable of reviving you so being downed is a no-no unless you dont mind a fair bit of backtracking from the last checkpoint.\n\nThere is some exploration to be had albiet completely optional, searching for CCTV cameras, token recording devices or laptops that reward you with additional XP and concept art unlocks in the gallery menu. All obtainable while looting for keys or switches to doors that were previously locked. So although levels seem linear, there is some exploration to be had, even if it is only minor deviations from your current tasks.\n\nIn conclusion the game is not terrible by any means but it is a misfire on something so full of potential. Its like a cheap mulled wine, merlot or chardonnay; take your pick. Its a cheap, pleasant experience that gets the job done but you'll find yourself with a dry taste in your mouth at the end and if you drank too much of it, probably a bit of a headache. Still, an experience worth visiting if you can pick it up on sale with a few friends who are daring enough to give something new, yet old a try.\n\nFINAL SCORE:\n65/100\n\nBy Daniel Kerr Spendlove\nwritten for AbsoluteHell.net","January 15, 2015","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's your typical 3rd-person, shoulder-shooter with a Resident Evil skin. Some of the mechanics keep it interesting at times (like the "infection" status), but it's ultimately unoriginal and nothing special.\n\nSo with a mediocre gameplay, surely the story would be its saving grace?\n\nNope.\n\nThe story, while midly amusing, is basically a "what if" plot for Resident Evil 2 and 3, and it's not very good.

The Team play is awesome not only you can do single player but you can also do multi player and hang with your friends and kill zombies together! The game is alot of fun and if you play Resident Evil and you want to know what happened during RE 2 and Nemesis? This is the game you want to get to learn what goes on.\n\nThe level up system is awesome throughout the game you can see who is stronger but there's also a character selection you can choose any of the 6 members of wolfpack. Vector, Lupa, Beltway, Bertha, Spectre and Four Eyes you can pick the skills you want to get and the weapons you want to use.\n\nSo I would recommend this game to any player who loves RE and who like team play","April 16, 2015","true","76.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It definitely doesn't at all play like the recent titles, putting a prime focus on four-player (squad-based) shootouts. Unforunately, that killed the horror factor (which is pretty much dead already) and instead set a higher focus on firefights.\n\nThe above would be fine if more work was put into making the title more fun instead of different. However, it falls short, as most every other player might've complained.\n\n-Mismatched horizontal/vertical mouse sensitivity\n-Higher difficulties seem to only multiply enemy health, dragging out fights and bosses for far too long as you spend much of the time filling an enemy's head with more bullets than they have brain cells.\n-Campaign felt rather short and anticlimactic, with the already iffy gameplay ruining encounters.\n-Executing zombified teammates had no weight or tension since you could resurrect them a second later\n-The healthy selection of characters doesn't make up for seemingly uninspired abilities and pretty much no character development, if that was even to be expected.\n-Optimization was incredibly..not there. My framerate shot down before even exiting the elevator in the very beginning of the game.\n\nI would only suggest playing without high expectations and with friends. It's not amazing, but playable, however not exactly worth playing.","February 24, 2013","false","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/purpledragonfun/recommended/209100/","purpledragonfun","A Kuronekos Fine Too","http://steamcommunity.com/id/purpledragonfun/","99 products in account","I can't really call myself a true Resident Evil fan, I've only recently managed to play Resident Evil 4 and have never played any of the original games (I.E Resident Evil 1-3). I will go ahead now and say I rather enjoy this game quite a bit, it's certainly got enough charm for a quick game every now and then but it doesn't have the lasting draw that most other RE games have. Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City did some things right, but did quite a lot at a mediocre level and some things plain badly, so I'll tell you what i think, and you can decide for yourself.\n\nThe Good\n-The Character design: The characters and most enemies in this game are quite varied in appearance and personality, and I like that. Mainly I'm talking about Wolf Pack here, they each have an interesting back-story that is never mentioned in-game (you'll need an external source like a wikia for that) and they all look unique and interesting. Personally if they were a little more developed I wouldn't mind seeing them in other games.\n-The Music: I'll say now regardless of how one-sided my opinion is, I love the music in the game. It's a mix of atmospheric tones to intense dramatic symphonies, all of them fit their respective situations perfectly.\n\nThe Okay\n-The Cover mechanics: Cover in this game is a bit iffy, some things you can hide behind others you can't sometimes you can shoot from cover sometimes you can't. It's kinda like rolling the dice with your health and that's never a good thing.\n-The Combat mechanics: Combat is arguably the main aspect of RE:ORC, and when the main aspect of the game isn't the best part of the game, you're not in for a good time. Recoil feels almost non-existent but bullet spread is a pain to manage, especially with the less accurate weapons. The meele combat is okay, however performing executions and special moves is unresponsive and it usually takes multiple attempts to perform one.\n\nThe Bad\n- Enemy design : Enemies in this game can be easily described with the term "bullet sponge". They all take a hell of a lot of ammo to kill and that's not helping the face you hardly have any to begin with. This isn't a problem when it comes to the slow and easy to deal with zombies, but when faced with enemy humans, hunters and lickers it becomes a huge problem and is even more apparent in the harder difficulties. Additionally shooting enemies hardly causes them to react, they just take it like nothing has happened most of the time which is frustrating when it comes to already hard to kill enemies like the hunters or the final boss depending on what choice you make.\n- The Story: Not much to say here, even for a spin off title in an alternate reality the story of this game is really weak and boring with no real development of characters.\n\nAll in all, RE:ORC is a game that's fun with friends, but not worth the given price-tag. Give it a shot if you can ever get it cheaper but don't expect to be amazed by the game.","May 23, 2015","false","32.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

We get to fight Nemisis all over again and get to fight those pesky Tyrants. And who can forgot the all annoying Lickers and Hunters?

The graphics aren't particularly great, but the game can have an interesting draw to it that I really can't explain.  Each of the characters has some cool things that can be done, the weapons are interesting, as well as the special abilities.\n\nAll in all this game is far from perfect.

You can only play single player offline and that is all since GFWL is built into the game. You need the program to work and good luck on that plus for me the game has stuttering issues as well but that could be caused by window 10 since this game is kind of old already but if you have a window 7 then go head and buy the game and give it a try once it's on sale or buy it through ♥♥♥ since its cheaper on there. For window 7 user the Games For Window live will work for you and don't have to worry about doing all kind of file modding to get the game working like us Window 10 user's.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Impoxdragon/recommended/209100/","Impoxdragon","Impoxdragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Impoxdragon/","300 products in account","Although many people consider this a horrible game, I find it to be fun and enjoyable if you know what to do.   FIrst off, the game has glitches and bugs that can definitely ruin the player experience; A.I. seems to be the most common but picking different teammates can fix that to an extent (having an all female team + the player makes the game easier) and sometimes the menu might tell you to press B for a second instead of Enter.  Medics especially have the best A.I. since they'll haul ♥♥♥ just to save you from death if you've taken too much damage (but they might heal you after you've healed yourself with and herb or First Aid Spray.)  You can also sometimes stick to cover when you don't want to and not stick to cover when you want to (I've only experienced the former.)\n\nThe campaign for the game can either be long and frustrating or short and enjoyable, depending on difficulty and player playstyle (this game really only gives the option to attack instead of sneaking, seeing that you're on an elite team sent to destroy evidence and kill witnesses, which is pretty damn edgy and feels like a bit of fanfiction) but you can turn the infected against your enemies by using a special ability by the team Scientist or making enemies bleed out.  There is also the Echo Six Campaign which seems a bit more fun (to me at least) but is hidden away in the Chapter Select menu.\n\nThe game runs smoothly on my laptop on Max settings and at an always nice 60fps.  Mind you, this is a laptop from the Summer of 2013 and is non-gaming (Intel i7, 16GB RAM, 1TB Hard drive and IntelHD 5000)\n\nThe multiplayer seems to be dead and might not come back (even if it were given T-Virus) seeing as GFWL is still being used, which is a shame as the multiplayer can be the most fun you can ever have on this game (which seems to be a trend with most games, but I digress.)  Though you can sometimes find someone to play with in co-op at rare times.\n\nThe Cosmetic DLC isn't really worth it at a normal price but on sale it's an ok buy (it changes the colour of the player's chosen character and gives them a slightly different outfit, at least in terms of Vector's.)  The Weapons DLC can make the game easier or harder (The Matilda and Grenade Launcher are horrible weapons since you can't shoot well at long range and have limited ammo, both in terms of magazine and resevoir; and not being able to pick up extra ammo, respectively) so just either pick and choose which weapon pack you want, buy the Complete Pack or just get the Weapon Stash for all eight weapons. The Campaign DLC has a slightly better A.I. than the base game but it still has some of the faults of the base game (getting stuck or stopping at a random area and sometimes just tanking bullets from enemies.)\n\nSeeing as this game was only published and not developed by Capcom, there should be some similarities from games developed by Slant Six Games such as the SOCOM series.   Actually, it plays a LOT like them.  There might've been a sequel to this game but Slant Six closed down in June of 2013; it could be a blessing or a curse.\n\nI really recommend this game ONLY if it's on sale and not a regular price, though I shouldn't discourage you from buying this if you really want it and want to play with a friend (or 3)","March 7, 2014","true","46.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are part of a squad from Umbrella that must follow orders and do missions within the disastrous and unstable Raccoon City.\n\nYou are a squadron of 4 deployed by Umbrella, you get to choose your character you play as, aswell as the companions you bring along with you, note the campaign can also be played with 4 other players to have a full coop story experience.\n\nThere is a a few different classes and characters, such as Vector(Recon), Lupo, Beltway (Explosive Specialist), Spectre (Marksman), Bertha (Medic), FourEyes (Scientist). They all have different abilities such as Stealth, Seeing through Walls, Plantings explosives, Healing, & all kinds of different perks. Which is nice to be able to choose whom you enjoy playing as the most.\n\nYou can unlock new weapons, perks & abilities by buying them with XP which is nice. Though the level system is quite redundent.\n\nThe story itself is mediocre, nothing to shabby or to keep you wanting to move forward, you end up just shugging along although it was nice to see characters such as Nemesis, Leon, Claire, Sherry & Ada during your travels in Raccoon City. It was a nice cross-over with Resident Evil 2-3's story although this games story is Non-Canon to the series.\n\nNow well the big part, the Gameplay. I found this game to be entertaining most times. Shooting up zombies and infected, (those Crimson Heads & Hunters sure could be a pain) but I enjoyed having a challenge with B.O.W's which was nice and shooting up zombies on the streets of Raccoon City.\n\nWhat I absolutely despised about this game was the "Enemy Soldiers", they were literarly your worst nightmare and they were freaking everywhere you go in this damn game. They would be spammed in large numbers and were hard to kill, they would Harass/Aim-Bot/Shoot You Up as if you were trying to land on D-Day. One soldier could literarly murder you within 2 seconds if your not in cover, now imagine 15 of them clumped like a bunker you have to get through (Dying Simulater begins). The Enemy Soldier A.I are ridiculously hard in this game even on Normal and they will kill you.\n\nRemember when I mentioned getting through soldiers is like attempting to get through a bunker with an automated turret?, well imagine that but with 20 zombies harassing you at the same time, is that not enough how about annoying Crimson Heads and Hunters, yea your gonna get real angry during situations like that because this game is stupidly unbalanced.\n\nAh, so you cleared the area of Zombies & B.O.W's?, well you better watch out because that soldier over there just killed  you. Oh?, not a problem right this game has checkpoints?, Oh did I forget to mention this game has one of the worst Checkpoints systems I have ever seen... If you clear a room of 50 people proceed a bit further and die... well guess what? you gotta clear all that bull crap again, and it will happen ALOT in this game.\n\nBut, I have A.I Partners to help me right?, Your A.I Partners are useless as Nipples on a Man. They may get a few zombie kills, but oh boy when it comes to fighting Soldiers & B.O.W's you are the one whos gonna do all the work. Example of treachery: You have Bertha on your team because she's a medic, well she aint gonna heal you when you absolutely need it, you could be right next to her with little to no health and she will prioretize any enemy over healing your behind.\n\nIf you got friends you can play with, do it because the A.I are useless, YOU are the one man army here with a bunch of monkeys with guns.\n\nThis game has a crappy Auto-Cover system, more reason to die.\n\nOverall, this game can provide entertainment. I had fun playing it, apart from the deaths from soldiers of course. Is it worth its retail value?, Absolutely not BUY IT ON SALE as I did, no more than $10 should you pay for this game.\n\nDon't believe me about the Enemy Soldiers?, well I will leave that for you to find out on your own :)","January 13","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was happy as hell but soon i would find out the hard way that GFWL does not work on window 10 at all. If you have a Window 10 OS DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. You can only play single player offline and that is all since GFWL is built into the game. You need the program to work and good luck on that plus for me the game has stuttering issues as well but that could be caused by window 10 since this game is kind of old already but if you have a window 7 then go head and buy the game and give it a try once it's on sale or buy it through ♥♥♥ since its cheaper on there. For window 7 user the Games For Window live will work for you and don't have to worry about doing all kind of file modding to get the game working like us Window 10 user's. I am still going to keep my copy of the game and hope one day that someone is able to find a fix to allow me to play online until then I can only sit back and play the waiting game...I hope this help out anyone looking to buy the game.

If you love sniping, heavy machine guns, assault rifles ect, this one allows you to do all of it & more.  Playing as Umbrella Security Service totally rocks (being the bad guys is always fun) & even more so when playing with your friends.  The dialogue is fun to listen to, the storyline is engaging & definately sets the mood.  This game is actually a *challenge*, even when playing with your friends on normal difficulty & the AI actually uses tactics.  The music, graphics & sound effects all get top marks in my book.  Each character gets a unique melee attack (and unique abilities), what you see in the video is pretty much what you get, theres nothing more satisfying then shoving a grenade into a zombies mouth & then kicking them into a ton of zombies & *boom*  =D  For a stand up shooter with your friends (or by yourself) this one totally rocks,  I highly recommend it.","January 16","true","43.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/purpledragonfun/recommended/209100/","purpledragonfun","A Kuronekos Fine Too","http://steamcommunity.com/id/purpledragonfun/","99 products in account","I can't really call myself a true Resident Evil fan, I've only recently managed to play Resident Evil 4 and have never played any of the original games (I.E Resident Evil 1-3). I will go ahead now and say I rather enjoy this game quite a bit, it's certainly got enough charm for a quick game every now and then but it doesn't have the lasting draw that most other RE games have. Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City did some things right, but did quite a lot at a mediocre level and some things plain badly, so I'll tell you what i think, and you can decide for yourself.\n\nThe Good\n-The Character design: The characters and most enemies in this game are quite varied in appearance and personality, and I like that. Mainly I'm talking about Wolf Pack here, they each have an interesting back-story that is never mentioned in-game (you'll need an external source like a wikia for that) and they all look unique and interesting. Personally if they were a little more developed I wouldn't mind seeing them in other games.\n-The Music: I'll say now regardless of how one-sided my opinion is, I love the music in the game. It's a mix of atmospheric tones to intense dramatic symphonies, all of them fit their respective situations perfectly.\n\nThe Okay\n-The Cover mechanics: Cover in this game is a bit iffy, some things you can hide behind others you can't sometimes you can shoot from cover sometimes you can't. It's kinda like rolling the dice with your health and that's never a good thing.\n-The Combat mechanics: Combat is arguably the main aspect of RE:ORC, and when the main aspect of the game isn't the best part of the game, you're not in for a good time. Recoil feels almost non-existent but bullet spread is a pain to manage, especially with the less accurate weapons. The meele combat is okay, however performing executions and special moves is unresponsive and it usually takes multiple attempts to perform one.\n\nThe Bad\n- Enemy design : Enemies in this game can be easily described with the term "bullet sponge". They all take a hell of a lot of ammo to kill and that's not helping the face you hardly have any to begin with. This isn't a problem when it comes to the slow and easy to deal with zombies, but when faced with enemy humans, hunters and lickers it becomes a huge problem and is even more apparent in the harder difficulties. Additionally shooting enemies hardly causes them to react, they just take it like nothing has happened most of the time which is frustrating when it comes to already hard to kill enemies like the hunters or the final boss depending on what choice you make.\n- The Story: Not much to say here, even for a spin off title in an alternate reality the story of this game is really weak and boring with no real development of characters.\n\nAll in all, RE:ORC is a game that's fun with friends, but not worth the given price-tag. Give it a shot if you can ever get it cheaper but don't expect to be amazed by the game.","May 23, 2015","false","32.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

DO NOT BUY IF YOU CAN'T TROUBLESHOOT YOUR WAY OUT OF A WET PAPER BAG. (It was a pretty easy fix for me, but varies system to system.

This will be a review of the base game. Figured with summer sale on the way some people could use some info.\n\nJust closed out the game's ending with only 5 hours of play. I'll give some ups and downs followed by some general statements.\n\nPro's\n-(Some) creative set pieces\n-Decent voice acting\n-Decent music\n-Varied characters with differing playstyles / abilities\n-Coop\n\nCon's (I'm not gonna rub this too far into the grain but the game has a ton of them)\n-Ai is pants on head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (If at all possible, play with friends or online)\nWillfully will go into gunfire or areas with danger, also will not revive eachother (Solo play this means you die it's gg)\n-Story (while redeemable at points) is largely lackluster in presentation, I hear DLC fares a bit better but leaves off in a cliffhanger that will never be resolved\n-Graphics are so so\n-Controls could be better\n-Many mechanics (including finer tuned melee abilities, regular abilities, or dodging) are never explained\n-Game reads very much like a console port\n-Boss fights revolve around bulletspongey enemies\n-Multiplayer is done through games for windows live\n-Newer systems will have to use a fix\n-Lazy design choices (only 5 alternate zombie skins start looking a bit too familar by the time you're finished)\n\nA very interesting concept lacking in proper execution, as much as I fill up the con side of this list I don't regret my purchase. Anyone looking for a bit more Resident Evil probably won't walk away from this regretting it. Somewhere beneath this game you catch fleeting moments of greatness where you see that they started off with some really great ideas, core mechanics and setpieces. That said, controls, movement and gunfire feel kind of janky and are up to you to figure out with some things not being properly explained even in the controls menu. Story is forgetable but some banter between the characters was pretty cool and I personally thought they did a great job with the voice acting the rest of the game considered. Overall feeling is pretty fun if largely uninspired on the whole. More fun online with regular players.\n\nSome great mindless shooting if you're looking for it with a Resident Evil coat of paint. Just don't buy it at full price.\n\nWINDOWS 10 FIX - I.E  HOW TO TROUBLESHOOT YOUR WAY OUT OF A WET PAPER BAG\n\nThe game installer comes with an outdated games for windows live installer, rendering each game launch doomed to failure. To rectify this:\n\n- Go to control panel\n- Go Programs -> Uninstall program\n- Uninstall GWFL marketplace & redistrubtable\n- Restart PC (Some people say do this, I didn't and was fine)\n- Go to http://www.xbox.com/en-IN/Live/PC/DownloadClient and download latest GFWL\n- Win 10 users should be good to go, more fixes in the forums if you dig\n","May 30","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
