This game has a ton of polish, a few different game modes, very nice pixel art with lots of explosions happening all the time and 13 characters! This game is a bit different than your typical shmup. Your "bombs" in this game will explode by sacrificing your character against an enemy. Weird concept, but it works great! You can also buy multiple lives and new characters after each stage to make up for sacrficing yourself. Its still very difficult and most people wont make it past the Beginner difficulty.

Instead of playing as a single character with 4-some lifes, but instead, you play as a dozen dolls with a maz of a dozen lifes each, only if you have to gems.\nUnlike Touhou, bombing is both the real challenge and the main gimmick of this game. To bomb, you need to survive until your FLOW bar maxes out, and then, RUN FACE FIRST INTO THE CLOSEST ENEMY YOU FIND, WHAHAHA!!! Seriously, when you run into an enemy, your doll explodes, doing massive damage and basically killing everything inside it's lengthy radius. It's the only way you can beat many of the bosses without Timing Out, Timing Out = Hard to dodge bullets and No respawning, you die there, game over.\n\nHold for the nigh-unfair difficulty, and dumbass doujin game devs not knowing what the hell the options are, or what a mouse is, it's the closest thing to bullet hell you can get, and is it hell.\nDark Souls can suck it.","December 15, 2013","true","4.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Playing this blind is odious and how you need to play it is not as obvious as most other shmups.\nThe thing about having to crash against the bosses to kill them is interesting, but just as you would think, is very annoying to pull off since if you get hit by a bullet it negates the explosion and that's what's most likely to happen as you near the boss you're trying to attack.\nThe thing about the game entering sudden death mode when the timer runs out on the bosses, sure, it enforces the suicide bomb playstyle expected from the game, but will be an immediate turn down for anyone who, like me, came expecting a traditional shmup and didn't look for the manual. So, hopefully, you'll read the ♥♥♥♥ing game up. It still makes boss fights really annoying if you take too long to beat them, which is more likely than not since you'll spend most of your time running into bullets while trying to suicide into the boss. Hopefully this problem is solved once you give yourself enough practice and time to learn the game, I did not give myself that many.\nOne thing I remember from this game is that there were a couple patterns on ♥♥♥♥ing easy that did not ♥♥♥♥ing belong on easy.\nOne thing that bothered me a lot is that once you die, you get a short time to select a new character to send out, which you can select with the arrow keys. DON'T. Just ♥♥♥♥ing DON'T. If I want to select a new character before spawning, at least let it be only with the actual character selection keys. It's REALLY annoying when I set some character to be the next one to go out, and then when the current one dies, a completely different one is sent out because I didn't let go of the arrow keys or I pressed it too early.","January 5, 2014","true","4.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Second, crashing your doll in to something on purpose once your flow meter is charged will cause a powerful kamikaze attack, and is sometimes the only way to stop running out of time. Third: Half the dolls you can buy in the game are ♥♥♥♥; stick to Leaf, Earl, Assam and Clover. Armed with this information you can now make a stab at Euridice mode.

It's got all kinds of weird mechanics that simply don't work well in a bullet hell game and I feel alienated. You certainly cannot play this like any other shooter as the game constantly encourages you to get close to larger enemies and die to perform the most damage and most of the time you'll hit a bullet on your way there and waste that life. The bullets are also a lot faster, the character speeds more varied making it very difficult to pick up. Even the best players die constantly, making an attempt to be good at this game very undesirable and unrewarding.\n\nWith that said the Arrange Soundtrack is still awesome so feel free to get this on sale just to get a copy of the game's music!","September 10, 2014","false","2.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XmiseryX/recommended/92210/","XmiseryX","Misery","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XmiseryX/","382 products in account","Well, I hadnt played this game in ages, and after buying the Gundemonium Collection, I figured I"d have a go at it since I couldnt really remember much of it.\n\n....and then it very quickly hit me as to WHY I hadnt played this game in ages.  Suddenly, I remembered it all.  If you're wondering why my "time spent" on this game here on Steam is so low, and yet I'm writing a review, it's because I've already spent a big pile of time with this, and the other two games, on the PS3 versions, which came out quite some time ago.\n\nThe other two games in the trilogy are bloody brilliant.  Excellent bullet-hell type games.\n\nThis one though is different.  Everything that the other two get right, THIS one gets wrong.  Uninteresting attack patterns, extremely repetetive (and short) level design, stupid control issues (really?  There's no "slow movement" button here?  In a bullet-hell shmup? when there WAS one in the other two?), cheap boss attacks (the first boss: If you DONT know that he's going to do the arm swipe as his first attack, and if you dont ALREADY know just where to be when he does it, you WILL die 1 second into the fight.  Gets worse from there.) and one of the worst game mechanics I've ever heard of in this type of game.\n\nSee, here's the main gimmick:  You've got all of these different dolls that you control instead of ships.  You can switch them out when one dies, and you essentially get nine lives to go with.  All of them have different abilities and blah blah blah.  None of THAT matters, though, you see.  While that all sounds cool, it's obliterated by that particular gameplay mechanic that I mentioned up above.  You cant just shoot things in this or use special powers on them, nooooooooooo.   What you have to do is kill yourself.  No, really.  Bosses in particular CANNOT be beaten without doing this.... numerous times on each.  You fill up this "flow" meter by shooting stuff, and when it's powered up, ramming yourself into an enemy of any sort will cause the doll to violently explode, doing massive damage to anything caught in the blast.\n\nBosses take next to no damage from anything else, so you A: have to do this against them, and B: have to have enough remaining lives when you reach each one.\n\nBut the problem with this is simple:  This is a danmaku shmup.   Bullet-hell.  Where the idea of RAMMING something exists.  Think about that for a second.  You've got chaotic, and most importantly, DENSE patterns coming out from these things, and you have to RAM THE SOURCE OF THEM.  In other words, you must successfully plow directly through the areas with the highest bullet density (since it's where the shots are coming from) and successfully ram the boss without taking a hit.  Yeah.  Good luck with that one.\n\nTypically, getting really close to enemies... and I dont mean right next to them, but just a short distance away... in a bullet-hell game is quite the challenge for most players.  There are plenty of games of this type where the closer you are to an enemy when it pops, the more points you get.  Which makes sense due to the challenge of getting close without taking a hit.  But that's an OPTIONAL thing.... you dont HAVE to do it.  And you can learn it in bits and pieces.  As you go through the game in question, you'll learn the patterns and learn how everything works, and you spot different ways of getting close to some things to pop them, and so on.\n\nWell, in THIS game, you *have* to do it, and getting close isnt good enough.  Gotta actually collide with the thing.  AFTER surviving long enough to charge up the Flow meter.\n\nYeah.  Saying that this is frustrating is an understatement.\n\n\nThis developer has made a number of interesting and creative shmuppy games, and for the most part all of them are very good, which of course includes Gundemonium Recollection and GundeadliGne, the other two in this 3-pack.  But THIS game is the exception.  And I haaaaaaaate having to say that, as this is one of those developers that I have alot of respect for otherwise.\n\nBut even a great dev can make a mistake from time to time.","June 9, 2014","false","0.2"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","14","27","0","0"

Without any explanation it's a bit tough to start out. The game looks likes a standard shmup (shoot em up) game with bullet shooting, slowdown but there is one thing which is not clearly explained... how to use a bomb. As your doll stays on screen for some time your flow meter will go up and once it hits max you'll get a notification on your char which says bomb. All you need to do now is ram into your enemy. That's how you use a bomb. Sacrifice one doll's life to do massive amount of damage to the enemy. At first you're stuck just using a bunch of dolls named leaf, but as you progress you can buy different ones and each doll has a different style of attack, mana attack and bomb. Coming from someone that's played a lot of touhou and cave co, ltd games, it's not bad but I wish the characters would move faster. At least add an autofire button like most cave shmups.","November 27, 2011","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has many shot types in the form of the dolls you can make, so you gotta try to find the ones that suit the situation better or just the ones you like the most. There is quite a variety of ways to deal with the paterns, but it still requires you to have good dodging abilities if you want to make it to the end, because even though you can have a big amount of dolls, they'll run out pretty fast if you start messing up. On top of that, it also has a great soundtrack, which adds pretty well to the game's atmosphere. One flaw though is that the game doesn't do a good job at explaining some of it's unique and very important mechanics, so I do recommend looking up a guide for that, or you won't get that far.

Never thought I'd be using dolls to blast massive bad guys out of the sky before. Thing is, this game is tuff even on easy mode but fun enough to keep coming back for more punishment. Other than blowing up bad guys outta the sky in this bullet hell game, you are also fighting the clock in the boss battles. I didn't care much for the clock because the boss battles were hard enough in themselves. Too have a boss on the ropes and almost dead, then lose to the clock... frustrating. In the first level you begin with only one type of doll, weak primary fire but has the most massive destructive bomb mode. Using the bomb mode is usually the fastest way to take down a boss, the difficulty is getting close enough with the bullet hell on the screen. Bomb mode isn't cheap nor easy, first the doll has to power up to it and second, you lose that doll's life in using it. But then you are going to lose it anyways if you don't beat the clock in the boss mode. Other dolls can be bought with the crystals you collected on the first level and each type has different modes of attacks and firepower and all have that bomb mode. The graphics are pretty average for a 2.5-D over the top shooter and the music is simple and doesn't distract from the game. The controls are spot on which is a must in a bullet dodging game with two modes of speed. Hold you shoot button down and you move slower allowing the finer points of dodging shots and tap to double your speed to dodge bigger things. Another positive thing about this game is it doesn't give cheap shots as you fight your way to a boss, no enemies that pop out of nowhere and boxes you in. But that doesn't keep the game from releasing dozens of enemies on the screen at a time. I really like this game even though I can only really play it on easy and this game may look simple, it's a really fun challenge. As far as recommending? I'd recommend this over 9/10ths of the other garbage overhead shooters I've seen out there...","July 20, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And let's not forget going against a vast and near-invincible foe.\n\nThe choice between various dolls makes for an interesting strategic metagame, which made Hitogata Happa a lot of fun. BTW, my suggestion is that you should use the original soundtrack, as the new arrangements may be more nuanced, but they have lost a lot of the high-octane, flowing explosiveness the original has.","June 21, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It kept me entertained enough to justify it. If you never played a game like this, it's definitely worth a try, especially on sale\n\nAlso, it's a hard game, but never for a second I feel that it's hard due to a flaw in game mechanics. They are overall polished. I did eventually beat the first level, and I hope to come back\n\nOne thing I didn't like: the screen is very small unless you modify happa.ini. Setting width=-1 and height=-1 greatly enhanced the game for me, especially in windowed mode","August 10, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Look no farther, Hitogata Happa has been wooping my ♥♥♥ since the day I got it. I play a decent amount of old school shooters, but I was labeled as noob again when I started this game. I recommend this game to the hardcore players that want more than the challege. It's a quick game you can pick-up and put-down, so we can all get back to our busy lives. Hitogata Happa can be played on most computers and dosent use much data so gameplay feels consistant. It's a great game, dont be discouraged by the amount of times you die. Sometime you want to die on purpose.\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nANSWER: HELL YES!","December 9, 2015","true","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not even hard unless on the hardest difficulty. There's no slow down button ( I believe you slow down when you attack. Not helpful in the slightest when you need to dodge faster bullets.). Without reading the reviews here I would have never guessed that I would have to ram into the boss to deal damage with my bomb. Overall, I do not recommend this game in the series, but the other two are perfectly fine.","July 12, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Never thought I'd be using dolls to blast massive bad guys out of the sky before. Thing is, this game is tuff even on easy mode but fun enough to keep coming back for more punishment. Other than blowing up bad guys outta the sky in this bullet hell game, you are also fighting the clock in the boss battles. I didn't care much for the clock because the boss battles were hard enough in themselves. Too have a boss on the ropes and almost dead, then lose to the clock... frustrating. In the first level you begin with only one type of doll, weak primary fire but has the most massive destructive bomb mode. Using the bomb mode is usually the fastest way to take down a boss, the difficulty is getting close enough with the bullet hell on the screen. Bomb mode isn't cheap nor easy, first the doll has to power up to it and second, you lose that doll's life in using it. But then you are going to lose it anyways if you don't beat the clock in the boss mode. Other dolls can be bought with the crystals you collected on the first level and each type has different modes of attacks and firepower and all have that bomb mode. The graphics are pretty average for a 2.5-D over the top shooter and the music is simple and doesn't distract from the game. The controls are spot on which is a must in a bullet dodging game with two modes of speed. Hold you shoot button down and you move slower allowing the finer points of dodging shots and tap to double your speed to dodge bigger things. Another positive thing about this game is it doesn't give cheap shots as you fight your way to a boss, no enemies that pop out of nowhere and boxes you in. But that doesn't keep the game from releasing dozens of enemies on the screen at a time. I really like this game even though I can only really play it on easy and this game may look simple, it's a really fun challenge. As far as recommending? I'd recommend this over 9/10ths of the other garbage overhead shooters I've seen out there...","July 20, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
