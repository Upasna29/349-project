I don't expect a game to hold my hands but when the game doesn't give you very good feedback on what effect you are having it makes it nearly impossible to figure out what exactly the game creator had in mind for the player to execute.\n\nI'm 3/4 of the way through the game after about 2 hours of play so it also looks to be fairly short.\n\nIf they went through and gave the player a little more instruction on how I'm affecting the cellular simulation and added a few more levels this would be a solid action title. As it stands its a bit frustrating and short.\n\n+Graphics have a nice retro feel\n+Concept is awesome and well executed\n\n\n-Game can be completed in a few hours\n-No real replayability\n-Several mechanics in the game are not explained and the style of the game makes it fairly difficult to figure them out.","February 23, 2015","false","2.3"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","27","33","4","0"

I am already on the 3rd level and I am struggling. The feeling you get from succeeding is well worth it though. My tip is to study the visuals and help the game gives you and apply it. The music is good, it has a pulse to it which fits the theme. The visuals are nice and also are bright and understandable. I would reccommend it to anyone who likes a good challenge. Also it's relatively inexpensive fun!","March 7, 2015","true","0.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

The game's initial presentation is so low budget it doesn't live you much hope for a good experience. We play as a nanobot delivered by kind nordic race doctors with a syringe into a latino girl's arm, who just got infected with smth like Ebola. We gonna shoot red lesions of virus capturing vital organs with yellow serum made of voxels. Controls are clunky like in early 90s, I think the authors tried to show players how hard being a robot is. The instructions are scarce too. The girl cries of pain when you loose. It's horrible.\n\n************\nКак сказал Оскар Уайлд: "Только дураки не судят книгу по обложке". С самого начала тут видна такая низкобюджетность, что надежды на хороший опыт остается мало. Мы играем за наноробота (тайная жизнь Д.Медведева), которого добрые белые врачи ввели шприцом в предплечье латиноамериканской девочки, подхватившей какой-то страшный вирус типа Эболы. Всю игру мы будем расстреливать желтой сывороткой красные очаги инфекции, растекающиеся по организму воксельными метастазами. Управление корявое в духе ранних 90х, такое впечатление, что авторы хотели показать игроку, как трудно быть роботом. Девочка плачет от боли, когда проигрываем, это ужасно.\n\nИгра насильственно переведена на русский так, что мне не удалось запустить ее в оригинале. А переведена она машинным переводом. Учитывая и без того минималистичные инструкции... ох","September 9, 2015","false","0.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","1"
