"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metaSHODN/recommended/255370/","metaSHODN","Banana Sam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metaSHODN/","688 products in account","KickBeat is a rhythm game that's almost good, but doesn't quite hit the mark.\n\nFor starters there are only 24 tracks, and they're pretty much all either what wikipedia defines as 'Industrial Rock'/'NuMetal' or the 6 electronica/dance tracks from Electronic Super Joy.  This ultimately leads to a pretty low amount of genres.  There is an option to make custom tracks out of your own songs, and while you can set the BPM, you cannot add true custom tracking as far as I can tell, leading to a sub-par experience there.\n\nAs many other reviews have noted, the notes don't really match up with the rhythm that much, so you will primarily be relying on the visuals to know when to press buttons.  This leads into another large flaw of the game - the visuals are incredibly noisy, often making it a strain to know when the 'enemies' are coming.\n\nAnother mechanical quirk of the game are the 'power up' orbs.  These primarily just give you bonus points or multipliers.  There's also a shockwave (clears nearby enemies) and a shield, but using those actually grants less points than not using them.  The quirk is that you have to doubletap the button in order to pickup the orb.  On the higher difficulties, missing an orb counts as getting hit.  This is problematic because it can quickly grow incredibly tiresome to doubletap orb wielding enemies in succession.\n\nThe game was initially designed for consoles - as such I used a controller for it, but that brought its own slew of problems.  On expert/master difficulty, there are often enemies coming from three directions.  As almost anyone who plays on a controller is aware of, pressing an opposing pair of buttons (example: A+Y or X+B) on a controller is incredibly awkward.  Combine this with needing to doubletap, and getting punished for hitting extra buttons, leads to a frustrating setup.  I imagine this is much easier with a keyboard, but it does raise the question of why the game was designed this way to begin with since it initially launched on console.\n\nFinally, I just wanted to point out the silly unlock system the game uses.  You're stuck with playing as the male character until you complete the game's story as him - then you can use the female.  Despite being given seperate 'stories' they both play the exact same songs, and have the same gameplay.\n\nOh - right, this game actually has a story.  It's, as to be expected, absurdly terrible.  This isn't a problem in itself, except for the fact that there are a couple brief unskippable cutscene parts associated with the 'boss battles' which are painful to sit through.\n\n\nAnyway, despite all my whining, I did finish the game - which is saying something in itself.  There is potential here, and if you picked this up in a bundle, it's worth giving a whirl.  Ultimately however, I cannot recommend actually buying this game by itself.","November 21, 2014","false","2.3"," 75 of 94 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","75","94","0","0"

This is a standard push the buttons with the music rhythm game. instead of the note highway or scrolling indicators this title uses a radial format combined with a fighting game aesthetic. Fighters enter the combat zone and rotate around you until moving to strike from one of the four cardinal directions and you press the corisponding button to stop them. There are 3 enemy types, denoted by color, which indicate on or off beat and multi button attacks. That's all there is though, just press buttons with the beat. It can get quite challenging at the higher settings, but not in a enjoyable way, the complexity never evolves. You are able to import your own music into the game allowing for some customizable fun. The core soundtrack is a bit 10 years ago, and the story is a bit of goofy fun. For the asking price of $10 I feel like it's not a bad deal if you are looking for a simple rhythm game with a fun aesthetic. It does not stack up to the greats in this genre, so buyer beware.","January 20, 2014","false","5.8"," 211 of 323 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","211","323","0","1"

The tracklist is great, including both electronic music, and hard rock that has an electronic feel. The in-game notes are well done, and the ability to create your own track, although limited, is a nice touch. I wish there were more options for various difficulties as I found the differences of difficulties to be quite overwhelming, mostly because of the visuals and not the notes themselves.","January 13, 2014","true","2.0"," 121 of 181 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","121","181","0","3"

Because there's no instrument or dance pad. It's meant to be played with a controller or keyboard.\n\nI personally had been waiting for a game like this to come around for a long time, that is to say, a tap rythym game where there's something more interesting to look at than just arrows flying by the screen.\n\nThe production value feels very high to me for a $9.99 out of the gate priced game, it's really a big treat. It looks great, it sounds great, it plays tight and its got an interesting well written and well voiced storyline that plays out twice through the songs. It's got difficulty settings and customization options that allow you to jump right in but still eventually take off your training wheels as you go for huge scores on mind bendingly tough difficulties for rankings on the leaderboards, and achivements that actually mean something.\n\nThe playlist is 24 "get-your-blood-pumping" high b.p.m. songs ranging from Rap to Eletro to Nu Metal. Every single song is enjoyable and fun to play, there isn't a single one that I want to skip over and many that I want to play again and again.\n\nWhile this isn't nessicarily a game for every rythym gamer out there, with its low cost and realitively easy learning curve, I recommend picking it up if your interest is sparkked at all. Is it hardcore? Yes. Will it probably make you frustrated? Yes. Will you continue to come back to play more and more eventually mastering each song and having a huge feeling of accomplishment? Most certainly yes.","January 21, 2014","true","16.7"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","30","42","0","0"

It seems perfectly synced to me, once I got into it I got lots of perfects. Yes, it's not all on the beat but it even tells you this during the tutorial/training, it's not exclusively using the drumbeats, it's more about the feel of the song I'd say.\nI got it in the humble bundle as well and didn't expect too much of it, but I have to say it's really fun. It seems really hard at first, but I got the hang of it in my first hour of playing and it feels awesome when you do get it and start pummeling strings of baddies in a row.\nI can't play it too long at once though, playing on a keyboard works fine but after a little over an hour my hand starts aching. It's a great game for a few quick rounds though, and the advantage over something like guitar hero seems to be that the action continues very quickly, 10 seconds or so after a song ends a new one can be starting if you want.","November 19, 2014","true","3.4"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","22","30","0","0"

For the first little while, on very low difficulties, it seemed like a lot of fun. Mixing a rhythm game with a beat 'em up is something that could have worked great, but rather than try to create some sort of unique gameplay style instead it's pretty much just a cluttered, gaudy version of DDR. The visual design is extremely messy, often obscuring the intended button presses with too many effects and flashing lights, especially in later stages. The timing and rhythm of the notes/strikes also frequently feels off, not following the same logic as other rhythm games. Worst of all, the soundtrack is small and only covers a few musical genres, some of which I don't personally enjoy. Had potential, didn't realize it.","June 2, 2015","false","1.8"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","18","24","0","0"

KickBeat is a DDR-style rhythm game with a holistic sensibility about the beat, jumping among drums, guitar, and vocals as they become prominent in the song.  It doesn't feel like you're playing the drums with your keyboard; it feels like you're conducting the whole song.  The mapping of the built-in songs is precise and joyful.  The songs themselves are way more industrial-metal than I usually prefer, but in this game they work perfectly, and you'll agree with me even if it's not your genre.\n\nApart from gameplay, one thing that really stands out is the unexpectedly hilarious writing of the cutscenes.  Honest belly laughs.  It's baffling how writers with such good instincts could name their game KickBeat, possibly the most forgettable name for a video game I can think of, right up there with the equally underappreciated Defender's Quest.\n\nThe upper difficulty levels sometimes require three simultaneous button presses, and some keyboards -- including both of mine -- have an issue with "ghosting" that prevents them from registering all three.  This is not a game bug, it's a hardware bug, but it's still something to be aware of before you buy.  The lower difficulty levels are still plenty satisfying and offer lots of replayability.\n\nFull-throated recommendation.

I'm sure the developers would have liked to add advanced track editing, more songs, more characters, more anything, really. It's a game that aspired to be the best, and while it's good, it fell short of staying in the spotlight due to the aforementioned issues.\n\nThe good:\n\nKickbeat features something that most rhythm games don't have, especially among those that try to bend genres to include a wider audience (I'm looking at you, Audiosurf). At its heart, it's a competitive game. It's a hard game. It's one of the few rhythm games out there that has a scoring system which means something. If you can six-star a song on master, you can post a video on Youtube, and and proceed to feel good about it. This isn't a game that you zone out and play. At least not if you want to do well. At the same time, the game's not impossible, nor is it inaccessible. It incorporates a few ideas, but it doesn't make the gameplay awkward. It's simple, but different, and in this case, it works. The developers made sure that this game ran well, and of course felt good to play. What it skimmed on with features, it more than made up for with a good core.\n\nGetting good at the game is hard, and for some people, just being able to play it is hard. Kickbeat's story mode does a great job of at least making you able to. It's cute. It's funny. It'll make you stop and ask yourself why most games try so hard with their stories.\n\nRating the value of a competitive rhythm game is hard, especially one that's well aged. I won't. If you play Kickbeat, from start to finish, you'll at least get 10 hours out of it, which isn't bad for the price. If you put it down because it's too hard after two, I guess I failed to warn you enough. The music selection is also one of the best I've heard in any rhythm game out there. They used good artists, and the tracks fit the gameplay well.\n\nLastly, I feel like I should touch on this, as it's the most important point of all. Do you like the concept of rhythm games, but feel like they're too pointless, are just for ♥♥♥♥♥♥y, and also like watching martial arts combat too intense for modern kung-fu movies? If you answered yes, I'm afraid you need to buy Kickbeat, because even with all of its flaws, this is the best rhythm game on the market for someone who doesn't want to either zone out and fall asleep, or play Osu! all the time.","May 7, 2015","true","91.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

A nice tracklist too. A good amount of techno, industrial, and metal.\n\nUsing a keyboard, I've 5 starred all songs on normal and most on hard, but once you get into expert mode this game becomes hard as hell. I also played with a keyboard that did not like when I hit three buttons (arrow keys, specifically. It accepted 3 button input with WASD keys.)\n\nIt would have been nice to have a new tracklist for the second character, Mei, rather than just replaying the same exact songs again.\n\nIt's cool, however, to be able to see everything that's actually happening on the screen, unlike rhythm games such as Guitar Hero or Rock Band, where you are too focused on the song most of the time to be able to pay attention to what's going on in the background. I found myself getting really into some of the songs because it was fun to watch your character to do kung-fu to industrial metal.\n\nI have not tried the beatmaker. Didn't really want to make the time. It'd be awesome if Kickbeat went the Audiosurf route and generated a match by pre-analyzing the selected track for beat, pace, etc.\n\nMy only major gripe with the game is when there are a lot of enemies on screen, it is EXTREMELY hard to tell where the they (mainly the blue dudes) are going to hit you next. The 4 colored buttons became blocked on occasion, and even if for a split second, it killed my huge combos. They can be turned off under settings, but I don't recommend this on higher difficulties unless you're confident enough to be able to follow the beat perfectly and you have the reflexes of a cat on meth.\n\nOverall, Kickbeat is a ton of fun, it's eye candy, and it's well worth the $10.","January 29, 2014","true","18.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Firstly the soundtrack that the game comes with is ok, it's not bad but it certainly isn't that great either, but this will most likely depend on your music tastes. The tracks tend to be a mix of techno, electronic with some rock/metal elements to them. It would seem that the ability to play your own music is a great asset of this game however this particular feature falls very short. This is due to the fact that when selecting a song to add to the game you have to go through a beat calulator process by which you manually tap spacebar to the rhythm of 3 different sections of the song. The beats per minute are capped at a certain level so you can't just go crazy with the system. Equally probably the most annoying thing is that you can add any track you like however if the track is longer than 6 minutes anything past the 6 minute mark will be cut off entirely. These 2 flaws don't really make the add your own music feature appealing and the system for calculating beats doesn't work all that well in fitting enemy timing with the song rhythm and comes of rather clunky.\n\nIf you are looking for a good rhythm game I would recommend avoiding this title particularly if you wish to play your own music.","June 11, 2014","false","3.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

At the time, Rock Band and Guitar Hero were dominating the music game market with the clever creation of game controllers turned musical instruments. However, just because the two powerhouses died a few years ago, this does not mean people try to keep the genre alive. Zen Studios has created a new take on the rhythm game genre with Kickbeat Steam Edition. The game was previously released on consoles but the release on Steam has additional content compared to the previous release. Having never played the console version I did play this game with a controller to see what it was like.\n\nAll of the world’s music is contained in a sphere. The one who controls the sphere, controls all the music that has been made, and will be made throughout all eternity. There are people in the world who wish to gain control of the sphere, that is why there is an ancient order of kung-fu masters protecting the orb from anyone who wishes to gain its power. Times are changing, and technology is growing, the temple where the Music Sphere is located is invaded by the most powerful man in all of media entertainment. Now his radio is the only one with music, it is up to a young man and woman to stop this greedy business man.\n\nWhile the story is not great, it is not bad either. It reminds me of a Netflix movie, relatively charming, but not winning any awards. Besides, this is a kung-fu driven music game, the story is going to reflect that novelty, and that is possibly the best part about it. The game has two story modes, one with Lee and one with Mei. Mei is the romance character in the story and the game plays similar, just has different character models and some different songs etc.\n\nRead the full review: http://brokenanalog.com/?p=44057","January 23, 2014","true","2.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It is also quite similar to another great game called One Finger Death Punch. KickBeat combines martial arts fighting and music to create a solid game. The game has a single player campaign Story Mode where you play through all of the songs that come with the game. First as a male character. And then as a female character. As you keep playing and get better scores on the songs that come with the game, you unlock more characters that you can play as. And you also unlock more outfits for the existing characters. You can of course also play this game with your own music files as well. Although in this game, you need to manually set the beats per minute for each custom song that you want to use. Although the game makes it fairly easy for you to do that. The game plays a 15 second section from the start, middle, and end of the song. And all you have to do is just tap the Space bar to the beat of the song. Then you can listen to the final result to make sure that the beats are set properly with the song. Then the song is ready to be played in the game. The game has selectable difficulty levels so you can choose how difficult you want any song to be. It may take some time to get used to playing KickBeat at first because the in game tutorial doesn't really prepare you very well. But keep practicing and you'll learn how to play the game. If you like music driven games like Audiosurf 2, Audiosurf 1, and Beat Hazard, then I recommend KickBeat","June 11, 2014","true","22.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

And it's a hectic one, let me tell you. There are 2 storylines to tell, but if you played through one of these stories you've heard all of the music so the second one isn't as much fun. But the story is genuinely funny and the music is pretty good, even if it's not what I normally listen to.\n\nSo you'll be fighting off enemies while music is playing, and with every produced beat you have to press a button, or multiple buttons, Do it right, and you'll create a nice combo resulting in more points, but fail and you'll get the mininum amount of points.\n\nThe music is up tempo so if you mess up once it will occasionally take several seconds to focus and recover, even if you're completely focused. Thankfully, there are power-ups to be earned and you'll need them to survive. If your health drops to 0, you have to start all over. Use power-ups to regain health, score more points or create a shield.\n\nPlaying on 'normal' anyone can complete the game, and it will take a lot of skill to complete these on higher difficulties. Especially the last boss fight had a big difficulty spike. Good luck with that ! So if you're the competitive type, this might just be for you.\n\nKickbeat is an enjoyable game that's absolutely worth it. But play it with a controller and save yourself some frustration. Just a friendly word of advice.\n\n[Rating: 72/100]","February 2, 2014","true","7.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

It looked like a cool concept to begin with (and the graphics are quite well executed), but for a rhythm game the rhythm keeping is hit and miss a lot of the time. It states that on harder difficulties (which is every difficulty but easy) that the rhythm swaps between drum beat, intruments and off beat vocals; which they claim is to increase diffculty.

You play as Lee or Mei, two cardboard cutout characters in a fight to protect… something.   The story is not really important and doesn’t get in the way or improve anything.  No matter your motivation, what’s clear is that you need to beat up hundreds of goons, and you need to beat them up with impeccable timing.\n\nAt first, the fighting/rhythm mashup mechanics can feel a little overwhelming. Your enemies encircle you, and in a specific sequence step into one of four quadrants represented by your action buttons. There are color-coded baddies, which inform how closely they can group, and if more than one can attack simultaneously. After a few songs, these rules seamlessly meld into your subconscious, and you can effectively groove into a Zen-like state that only good rhythm games afford.  The note charts and timings of each track feel dynamic and fine-tuned.  Each time a song drops a deep hook or a heavy beat, the corresponding skull bashing feels great.  The difficulty scales well, and you feel yourself improving to the same tune as your opposition.  Boss encounters provide slight variances to the core gameplay, and actually provide a decent change of pace.\n\nIn KickBeat, gamepads are not only supported they are strongly recommended.  Because of the difference in spacing between WASD and the intended cross pattern of the action buttons, one can’t effectively get into the groove on a keyboard as well as with a controller.\n\nAs for the actual soundtrack, it’s difficult to comment on given how subjective musical taste can be, but I found the quality of songs varied wildly.  You get a fair share of clumsy nu metal and rap rock, but you also have some well-crafted electronic, and some competent dub-step.  What’s surprisingly missing is “Kung Fu Fighting” by Carl Stevens.  Zen Studios, how did you miss this? Altogether, I’d say the soundtrack manages to have more good than bad, but some of the lower quality tracks have a tendency to bring you back down to earth.\n\nLuckily, the bundled soundtrack is just the start, and you can import any song from your MP3 collection.  However, don’t expect a fancy automated import tool. You will be required to tap a button to the beat of each song in order to calculate the BPM of that track.  Additionally, the note chart created for each song will only be based on the timing of the beats - no fancy progressions based on the actual notes or melodies, just timed commands.  It’s a feature that breathes a little more life into the original game, but not enough to keep you coming back for more.\n\nAs a devotee to rhythm games, I was excited to see if KickBeat could manage to deliver a new experience to a genre that has recently felt flat.  It’s concept of using hoards of thugs as beat-fodder is more than a gimmick and provides satisfying play, but an inconsistent soundtrack, hackneyed presentation, and a weak track importer unfortunately keep KickBeat from being a true contender.","January 20, 2014","true","3.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RobbYoung/recommended/255370/","RobbYoung","Pure","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RobbYoung/","503 products in account","To those who are not aware, music based games have moved on from Guitar Hero/Rockband clones, and have taken aspects from loads of different games, adding rhythm based mechanics over these. For PC gamers, this pot is starting to fill nicely, with games such as Audiosurf and Beat Hazard, who take ideas from old games like Asteroids and Wipeout. Kickbeat combines two genres that haven’t really had the same success as the earlier examples; the Music Fighting genre.\n\nIn its simplest terms, Kickbeat requires you to hit 4 buttons in rhythm to generic ninja soldiers coming towards you, all of which is in time to a piece of music. The variety in enemies is pretty poor, but as a game with 4 buttons, it would be difficult to see how they could improve this without changing mechanics.\n\nThe story mode of music games is often non-existent; look at the BIT.TRIP games, and tell me that any discernible story is given. Kickbeat tries to remedy this with a set of licensed tracks that come with the game, by artists like Pendulum and Marilyn Manson. Even with their best efforts, the story is just a thin film over the “complete these five tracks to unlock some more” system.\n\nFrom the perspective of Kickbeat being a fighting game… you’re gonna be disappointed. The game’s mechanics are the same as you will find in DDR, or any other dance mat game. The true fun you’ll find in Kickbeat comes from the fact that you can “fight” to your own tracks.\n\nYup. In the same vain as many of these music based games, due to not everyone having the same taste in tracks, you can import your own music into the game, and play the same way you can with the included tracks; although it takes a bit of setting up. Unfortunately, there seems to be effectively no detection algorithm used in Kickbeat to find BPM, or track intensity, instead relying on the “tap a button to the beat of the track” before you can play. Due to the game requiring lots of accuracy, it is incredibly annoying when the game is offsetting every beat by a fraction of a second compared to the music you’re hearing. The scale used to change when each beat happens is arbitrary, meaning you’re really using trial and error to see if the two tracks line up.\n\nKickbeat Promo 3So far it seems that all I’ve said has been pessimistic, but this game’s real quality comes from how, when you’ve spent your time making sure the game matches up sound and visuals, and you’ve learned all the small annoying traits each mechanic has, and you find yourself in a sort of “zone” the game feels great, the music matches the dynamics of the enemies perfectly, and you can just play and play for hours on end…\nUntil you try playing it on anything other than the lowest difficulty.\n\nThe way the game shows you which button you should press is confusing as hell for the first few levels. The enemies circle around you for a few beats before attacking you, when you need to counter them. This means that you need to remember which order they entered your “inner circle” and how long ago that was, to counter them perfectly. When you try playing on harder difficulties, this becomes nigh on impossible, especially as you have to sometimes hit three buttons simultaneously, or take 3 hits on your health.\n\nI’m not the best at fighting games, or precision rhythm games, but I’d say from the perspective of the average gamer, Kickbeat is a hassle to set up, has no useful story mode, and no multiplayer function.\nYet despite all this, I love it. Kickbeat has made me reach into my music library, and find some hidden gems that match the aesthetic perfectly. The game is effectively never ending, as any music you can play on your PC, you can play on your screen.\n\nRating: 7/10 - A huge amount of fun, if you’re happy to have an almost finished rhythm game, and have a LARGE library to play through.","January 27, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I enjoy them even more when they have my kind of music to play to.  But as others have said, some of these songs do not match beats well.  Now, when you get to use your own music and you go through the creation of a track, it breaks up the song into three parts.  I think this is an apt description of what felt like mismatched beats in the regular game.  It isn't that the songs are match well, it's just that the game isn't built dynamically enough.  For instance, the P.O.D. track.  It hit perfrectly in some spot, most actually, but then I'd find myself hitting a button expecting a beat and there was nothing.  Then I'd have a blast of button presses that didn't quite match up to my interpretation of the beat.\n\nAll that said, I think the game is a blast.

After a round of twitch-gaming like first person shooters, I find this game actually brings me back in focus. Almost like a zen garden for gamers. Even with its heavier beats and fast moments, nailing the patterns, half beats, double and triple beats, and hold moves is almost therapeutic. The music is suprisingly nostalgic and I find it superfluously fitting even if some tracks are older. I relish hearing them again. KickBeat accomplishes a unique and welcomed change with it's kung-fu action visualization to higher-bpm-type music. I find myself replaying levels to edge in the better scores, nail every perfect, and maximizng the use of items.\nAn absolutely solid value for the above alone. Add in the beat maker options, leaderboards, unlockables, I would easily have paid twice as much and been satisified with the cost.\nI use a z-board game-pad as well as arcade buttons which enhance my experience.

I recommend you check out the soundtrack before purchasing the game to make sure that you receive maximum enjoyment out of the game, as the storymode song list cannot be changed and while there is a way to play your own custom songs, I find the BPM Calculator to be a rather terrible way to try and calculate the beat for your own songs. This is because it only calculates BPM change at the beginning, middle, and end of the song, so if you find a song that changes BPM frequently, you may have trouble playing it; or, in my case, any song because you are slightly rhythmically challenged. Overall, though, I would recommend this game as I enjoyed the soundtrack, the story, and the gameplay, finding only the BPM Calculator to be a major flaw slightly due to design, mostly due to user failure.","February 15, 2014","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The songs are interesting and fresh. They are not regular songs you would normally hear in most games or anywhere for that matter. The flow of the cgi is great. The characters look nicely developed. The cool moves the character does throughout the game is fricken awesome too. The difficulty levels do grow significantly, at least -  you notice they change as you switch through the difficulties. There are different modes. You can play storymode, survival mode, training, and even play to your own beats.\n\nThe reason why I do not recommend this game is because of the actual gameplay. I like the concept of the character being in the center and the baddies slowly coming towards him however I find it difficult to time the buttons. Perhaps its just me not grasping the beats from the music, I find myself relying on the indicators of when the baddie is in place for me to hit them. When they step towards you the panel theyre on illuminates with color. If I didn't have that to help me I would probably have more trouble with this game. I have put a bit of time into it so I think I'm getting better. I also notice when you play, theres an animation of the baddie flying towards your screen which can also be troublesome when your trying to get the next beat.\nIt also feels like theres a lot going on, on the screen because the camera angle changes throughout the game, there are bad guys circling around you. It just seems a bit.. messy?... I'm not sure of the word I'm looking for.\n\nI do know that if you really want to try out this game because of the genre or its idea, and you have the extra money, I would recommend purchase this game.

However, when I started story mode (it has anime movies), even on easiest difficulty game was hard (first two levels especially). You need to watch where are enemies comming (you can't rely on music), and often is not clear who will first attack. Sometimes they both attack at same time, and in that case you need to use specific combo in order to not get kicked.\nMost irritating thing for me is that once you miss, and get hit by enemies, it is really hard to stand up and continue (in fast music rythums, thats the case in 2nd level).\nI can't imagine how it would be on harder difficulty.\n\nThing that I like in game is music and there are some good visual effects. Oh yea, you can't screenshot with F12 (which is shame, I missed some good shots).\nAnother bad thing is that when you put your own music, you need to press Space when you feel rhythum (for begining, middle and end of song). It's not scaling well (for example if song changes beat often). While this might be good thing for someone, I like more precalculated things.\nOverall, I would say that concept is interesting, but it needs good tunning.","November 23, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Originally released on the PS Vita and PS3: Zen Studios has released Kickbeat on Steam.\n\nThis is not your typical music & rhythm game where you are following arrows across the screen. It is action packed and fast paced, using fighting sequences to illustrate your ability to have good timing while enjoying their music or yours!\n\nWhile the story line is a bit of a weak front for all the action, the soundtrack they picked for this game is phenomenal. With artists such as Env, Blue Stahli and Rob Zombie, Kickbeat quickly immerses you into the rhythm. Now Zen Studios just needs to release a game soundtrack.\n\nIt is a major plus to add your own music to play along with. However I found it difficult to use the timer to get the beat down to give the game the same flow as the built in music. This is where the community comes in on the Zen Studios forums. Many players are posting the settings for some of the songs they’ve played. While your dusty copy of La Bouche might not find itself here, you can find popular titles such as Gentleman by Psy, Radioactive by Imagine Dragons and hundreds more.\n\nOne of the gems of Kickbeat are the ‘boss’ fights. They are presented in a unique and entertaining manner as they deviate from the fighting humanoid npc’s. This can really mess up your timing if you are graphically inclined. However, kicking rockets off a helipad while overlooking the city, listening to Rob Zombie, is rather enjoyable.\n\nIf you enjoy music and rhythm games I highly recommend picking up Kickbeat on Steam.","January 29, 2014","true","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is done by pressing four different buttons in a certain order pertaining to where enemies are onscreen. I used an Xbox 360 controller (so much easier) for my play sessions so far and I'd recommend one here, as the keyboard controls can get a bit frustrating. Using an Xbox 360 controller, picture the character standing in the middle of the A-X-Y-B buttons, now imagine enemies coming at you from any of those four buttons. Press the correct button in time (when the enemy is standing on it, about to attack you) to knock him out by way of some very nice Kung-Fu action.\n\nThis can get a bit more difficult if there's multiple enemies attacking simultaneously, forcing the player to react by pressing the buttons in accordance with which buttons the attackers are currently standing on. This gets even more intense later on when you've got five or so enemies attacking you every second. The game does have multiple difficult levels, however, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem to find the right difficulty for you. I went with "Expert" to begin with, which isn't even the hardest difficulty, and I found it near-impossible to finish a song. I ended up staying with "hard", as that was the only one I could actually go through with.\n\nI was a bit disappointing to know that I couldn't jump right into the game and use my own music, however. A certain portion of the campaign must be completed in order to unlock the "use your music" mode, which I would have greatly preferred to have used from the start. The campaign is fun though, so I didn't have to go through too much pain.\n\nKickBeat is an excellent rhythm game overall. Very fun and very intense (especially on the harder difficulties, of which "Master" is impossible). Highly recommended.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwHkG-WmbyM","January 25, 2014","true","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Well, I was disappointed to say the least. After three decent tutorial stages that explain how to handle different types of enemies and what powerups do, you will find yourself overwhelmed by the actual stages of the story mode. While the story seems quite interesting - it's about a sphere that holds all music ever created and the secret behind it - I just couldn't bother myself to complete more than two stages.\n\nWhy? The controls either suffer from serious input lag or the game offers zero room for syncopation. Also, the arrangement of enemy attacks and music beat appears to be extremly off. To put it simple: it's no fun, but a pain in the ♥♥♥. And no, I can't say I dislike games that require exact timing and rhythm, I really enjoyed One Finger Death Punch (which I can only highly recommend to people thinking of purchasing this game; it's got nothing to do with music at all, but see for yourself) and various other rhythm games on consoles.\n\nIt hurts to say that I'm glad I waited for this game to go on sale for ~3€. Atleast I can get some money back from selling trading cards :/ (actual playtime before I gave up was about 0.6h btw, rest is idling for cards)","May 20, 2014","false","1.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There's no stream of notes kind of things that I loved from DDR/ITG.\n\nButton pressing timing seems about on-par with ITG/stepmania, but the fact that they're often using a part of a song for the notes that doesn't make any sense and it can mess up rhythm especially when it suddenly jumps to following vocalist phrasing. This wouldn't be that bad if the screen had any sort of indication of the actual rhythm like with colours that previously mentioned games does, but there's only 3 colours, red (double/triple hits), yellow (singles "on beat") and blue ("stream" (2 or 3 in a row)), nothing to indicate rhythm at all. Listening to it wouldn't be that bad but again, the jumping suddenly to another aspect of the song throws you off unless you're intimately familiar with the sequence - oh, and don't bother memorizing anything but the "rhythm", they randomize the sequences on master difficulty, only keeping the "rhythm" constant every time you play the same song.\n\nPlay your own song feature is even more useless than in Audiosurf. You have to tap the beat and set a beat start position with millisecond accuracy (which is pretty much impossible) by hand. Songs cut off at 6 minutes, still can't play Art of Life or anything like that. There's a very limited file format support, don't even dream about FLAC.\nAnd when you finally get to play a song, the button sequence has absolutely nothing to do with anything in the song, except possibly the beat if you managed to tweak the right values in.\n\nI did collect all the achievements in this game and there was one that probably took me about 45-50 hours to get, but in the end it was just about staying concentrated for about an hour of songs with one non-resetting health bar.\n\nI would not recommend this game to seasoned rhythm game players, it's just too easy. The story is nice though so if it's on sale it can be a fun few hours.","October 12, 2014","false","54.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Story just doesn't cut it even if it's good.\n\nKickBeat puts a little too much effort in the story with cutscenes which i simply skip and bossfights that play the same as a default round.\n\nThe challenge is there on the higher levels if you wish to train yourself for the game's leaderboard (yes there is one and it doesn't seem to have been tampered with, all scores look legit) but if you just wish to make a single playtrough to check the story and music, either on normal or hard, the game is blantly easy. I made it high on the board just for my normal playtrough points and some plays on hard.\n\nWhen we come to the music is where you will be either sold on the game or look somewhere else. The game uses prebuild songs for the story mode - mainly from celldweller, blue stahli, ESJ soundtrack and other (amazing in my opinion) similar artists. This blend makes it so techno follows a strong vocal song which follows techno etc. For rhytm's sake the songs are great but not be up to everybody's taste. And you have to play them to unlock other features including...\n\nCustom music. This is what a lot of want from a rhytm game. I know I do. And you can do it! But here's the catch - you need to set up the beat of the song manually. Unlike other popular games like Audiosurf where the game does it for you or osu! where someone else (more gifted in the ears) has done it for you, you need to synch the beat of the song with the game for every song you add. But if thats a piece of cake for you and you give the game a perfect bpm... the game is still not that good with the generation of the level. It just isn't.\nOverall quite a mixed bag. I played it and I don't regret doing so as the idea of a rhytm based fighter (even if the fighting is just for show) is quite good and I had a lot of fun. But there are so much limitations (like window mode ffs) and untapped potential that I don't see myself playing it again after going trough the story songs once. Nor do I plan to add more of my music in the game as it is tedious and the end result is still laking. Thats why I don't plan on recommending it either.\n\n5/10","July 14, 2015","false","3.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The problem lies in the system. It relies upon archaic music gameplay style- it's basicly DDR with punching instead of arrows. While this isn't a bad game, the custom music mechanic frequently falls short, and is underwhelming. You have to play through a first few levels, which is rather annoying if you're not interested in the music that comes with the game. Once you do unlock music customization, the navigation to select songs is clumsy and poorly responsive to mouse input, making scrolling through large libraries or browsing a full drive difficult. The mapping system is limited by player attentiveness; you are expected to either know the BPM of the track, or be capable of timing your own inputs to the beats of the music. It's simply an underwhelming mechanic that is not atoned for by the rest of the game. There are solid principles underlying the game, but questionable stylistic and gameplay decisions limit the effectiveness of the game. It clings to console mechanics, even on a PC version, and is uncomfortable and awkward. The camera also skews slightly, making it at times difficult to follow where enemies are coming from.\n\nAll in all, it's not a bad game, but if you expect anything unique or interesting, you might want to look somewhere else. As for enjoying your own music, or a specific genre of music, you'll have to tolerate the ecclectic music selection of the campaign for a bit first. It's alright, but so much potential was wasted here.","January 23, 2014","false","1.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","5"

And if you hate it, it's because you're bad at it.\n\nHowever, that's not to say that Kickbeat is insanely difficult; I completed my own first playthrough on hard difficulty (the second of four in ascending order) and my second on the 'master' difficulty (the final one) without too many issues. I am pretty experienced when it comes to rhythm games though, so it may not be the same for everyone. I also quite liked the soundtrack.\n\nDo not be fooled by the kung fu aesthetics of Kickbeat, for it is no fighting game; Kickbeat is a rhythm game through and through, and in my opinion, a pretty good one at that. However, I would only recommend this game to someone who likes the soundtrack - the "beat your music" mode isn't brilliant, and rhythm games can be pretty lacklustre when you hate the song you're tapping along to. To re-iterate:\n\n-If you love the soundtrack and are a big fan of rhythm games, DEFINITELY BUY THIS GAME.\n-If you hate the soundtrack and are really bad at rhythm games, THIS GAME MAY NOT BE FOR YOU.\n-If you think rhythm games look pretty fun and want to give them a try, this game may be a good starting point.\n-If you aren't part of any of the above groups, then I wouldn't recommend buying the game purely for the "beat your music" mode, but other than that, it's a nice game.\n\nOn another note, despite my earlier statement that this game is altogether not too difficult, I would highly recommend for new and experienced players of rhythm games alike to play through the tutorial. It especially helps in getting those big scores.\n\nAs for the amount of content in this game, there are 24 tracks included, all of which playable on four different difficulties - and on the master difficulty, the direction from which enemies appear changes each time, creating a somewhat unique rhythm pattern each playthrough of any given song. In my opinion, this is a fair amount of content for the price tag of £6.99 - especially if you purchase this game during one of Steam's famous (or infamous, I'm sure, to game developers) sales. Kickbeat is the kind of game that if you enjoy enough to play through once, you're likely going to play at least some songs again....and again....and again.\n\nI apologise for the disorderly nature of this pseudo-review, but hope you found it useful nevertheless.","February 23, 2014","true","20.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Well this game gives you a chance to beat your own music while challenging your gamepad skills.\n\nIf you are a type of an eclectic audiophile who like good music and gaming then KickBeat is for you. I would also recommend using gamepad for this game cos using the keyboard may turn ugly at some stage, just as trying to walk straight after two bottles of vodka.\nThe game has a very nice visual layout and graphics. It also offers you several game mods. Of course there is a story mode based on a cliché love story and some good mix or rock and hip-hop. There is a free roam mode and most fun "Beat your Music" mode (warning if you are a Skrillex fan you may want to have a spare gamepad or two).\nOverall the game is definitely a joy to play and also helps you develop some basic attention and reaction skills. Oh try Fur Elise in this game, ♥♥♥ kicking implement in a Beethoven music is somewhat of an exquisite joy.\n\nLiked my review?

And guitar hero is always really hard to hit the notes on time so lets delay the button press about a quarter of a second from the actual beat; that will make it easier right? Okay, so next let's lock the character in place and have enemies attack from the four directions of the buttons on the controller. Oh? That’s too logical? Okay well then what if we just give the cameraman a huge hit of crack before each song?

The enviroment the gameplay is implemented in is what makes it interesting, because each succesful button hit equals to kicking a bad guy's ♥♥♥ in a cool way, or missing it causes them to hit you. The rythim changes based on the music playing, much like a Audiosurft of Guitar Hero titles work, and they have some really action pumping great stuff there to give your heart the bump-bump tempo while awesome (cartoonish) action is played on the screen.\n\nHowever, being a low budget game, sadly it has some downsides. The campign is exactly the same levels twice from half of it, with the same music, just with a different character (=skin, nothing else), and I think I counted 2 max 3 bands playing all the music in the game, and that's a huge negative for a game that is based on music. The lacking variety of artists really makes the whole thing feel like you are listening to Blue Stahli's Kill Me Every Time, and then 20 times the slightly different remixes.\n\nIt's a pick it up once or twice and be done with it game, definitly worth picking up on a nice discount if you are looking for a relaxing yet at the same time adrenaline pumping simple game.\n\nIt's subpar compared to the other bigger titles that made this genre popular (Audisurf, whatever guitar controller game you can think of etc.), mostly due to the very-very low number of artists and tracks (24) that mostly all sound the same with one or two exceptionally good one. You can add your own songs however, but I got bored of it before I reached that point that I'd want to try.

The enemies are a little off when you start playing; you have to adjust that in the Sound Settings.\n\nI bought this on a humble bundle. The other games were great, and I decided to throw in another 2 dollars for this.\nI went through the tutorial and it looked like a great concept.\nThen I started playing.\nThe game is basically unplayable in my opinion, even after fixing the timing issue. The scenes are dark, so I can't see what color the enemies are, which is the sole point of the timing. Also, there's too much going on in the scene for me to be able to see which side lighted up first until it's too late. Also, the game has a tendency to, when there's clearly a repetition for a beat, to randomly skip certain notes, causing me to miss them. As a very musical person, this game is just unplayable.\n\nEDIT: I walked away for a good hour, came back, and the game is a little bit more playable. I imported my own music (Space Jam Theme), and I now understand how this game's tracking works. it just follows where the loudest noise is. Now that I know this, after playing through the old songs again, I'm starting to feel better about this game. I'll play it tomorrow and maybe /MAYBE/ change it to thumbs up if I've finally gotten the hang of it.","August 21, 2014","false","3.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The idea and presentation is top notch and the music (although nothing I would actually listen to) is superb.  Where it falls flat is the execution.  Your moves lack punch and vibrancy.  They feel disconnected from the music and don't have the sound feedback a game like this needs.\n\nThe mechanic itself feels weak and ruined by a few poor choices.  An example is that the enemies have a colour that ties to how you need to deal with them.  The colour isn't entirely obvious in the swirling mass of lights and more often than not, they are stood in a coloured light making it even more visually confusing.  To make matters worse, one failure means taking a multitude of hits.  While this doesn't usually end the game, being stunlocked is never fun.\n\nOn the whole, I don't hate this game.  I just don't really like it.  If this is your kind of thing, I'm sure you could find the groove and have a great time with it.

However, Kickbeat has you pressing buttons along with the beat  and in-between the beat, which makes the game much more difficult, and is the reason most people do not like the game. At the highest difficulty level (Master) there are also button presses linked to the vocals, which turns the game into button mashing madness.\n\nThe game has 24 songs, a mix of hip-hop and rock, and 4 difficulty levels to choose from. You start out with one character in the story mode, but can unlock 6 more, and multiple costumes for each, thru game play.\n\nThe weakest part of the game is the Beat Your Music mode which lets you play using mp3s on your pc. The game does not automatically synch to the beat of the song, so you must use the included BPS (beats per second) counter to tap out the beat. This becomes tedious very quickly and no matter how much you tweak it the enemies and the beat always seems slightly out of synch.\n\n1, 2, do the Kung-Fu\n3, 4, on the dance floor","February 7, 2015","true","81.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This story is told through well drawn stop motion cutscene pictures but often times I would have been ok with a little less constant fading in and out of characters taking small steps but maybe I am a bit picky about that.\n\nGameplay feels great, its a music game so everything goes with a beat and it feels really really good to keep that beat. After gaining some skill and replaying the first few songs again I had a whole lot more fun than I did the first run.\n\nIf you like music timing games, this isn't a bad one to pick up.

I love music and I love games that allow me to play with my music. Sadly, KickBeat is not one of those games. Why? Let's begin from the start.\n\nBefore you are able to play with your own music you must complete a few story missions, including a boss. The songs are not that bad and they include special tracks unique to the Steam Edition. There's a lot of colors on the screen, and while it doesn't bother me, it could easily bother many others quite easily. Some of the controls are not very intuitive and you'll find yourself forced to play the tutorial or read the control scheme in the options menu. The first boss you are tasked with offers nothing different from the normal tracks, you are only required to press one additional key four or five times.\n\nOnce I finished this fight, I was quite excited to play with my own music in the "Beat Your Music" mode, but it was only a huge dissapointment. In order to play with your music, you must set the settings yourself and "Find the Beat" by pressing space while the game makes you listen to a few seconds of your selected song. The result is not accurate, not at all. The game seems to place the keys you must press at random, and the flow is all over the place. Unlike the story mode songs, which are fun and on track with the beat, this is not fun at all to play. Oh, and did I mention your must do this for every single song you want to play? If you're like me and have a library of over 2000 songs you want to listen to and play, you'll have to spend 2 or 3 minutes per song having to set the beat which will most likely not even fit with what you're listening while you play.\n\nOther than this, the game has little else to offer. There is an endless mode, which most score attack games have, with a little bit of character customization. There's also a secondary character in the story mode, but I honestly couldn't be bothered to play through the first character first, the game just isn't fun.\n\nThe Strong ||\n- Good visuals\n- Good musical tracks in Story Mode\n- Good gameplay in the Story Mode\n\nThe Weak ||\n- Way too much colors on the screen\n- Unintuitive controls\n- Playing your own music feels like a chore\n- The gameplay while in "Beat your Music" is not on time and does not feel natural\n- Aside from Story Mode, there is little else","June 20, 2014","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not for the music, but the gameplay itself is just flawed.  The UI is a bit confusing, and can take a while to realize what, exactly, signified what.  Your fail conditions, etc.  You "attack" by pressing the proper key in the direction of the circling attacker when they reach the highlighted point on the ground.  However, the four points are you are completely separated from each other.  There is no real way to tell if the attacks are simultaneous or just very close - and if they are very close, what order they'll be in, unless you watched the attackers enter the stage and haven't lost track of them while trying to defeat the ones before them.  And that leads to some songs being absurdly difficult.  The story - as irrelevant as it is - is your typical "source of all music" someone trying to steal/destroy all except the ones for themselves to monopolize.  And they've ATTEMPTED to put humor in, but every joke I recognized as a joke fell completely flat.  Nothing in it is cute or clever, nothing in the game is particularly well thought out.  Someone decided they wanted to try their hand at a quick and dirty rhythm and this is the result.

I love music and I love games that allow me to play with my music. Sadly, KickBeat is not one of those games. Why? Let's begin from the start.\n\nBefore you are able to play with your own music you must complete a few story missions, including a boss. The songs are not that bad and they include special tracks unique to the Steam Edition. There's a lot of colors on the screen, and while it doesn't bother me, it could easily bother many others quite easily. Some of the controls are not very intuitive and you'll find yourself forced to play the tutorial or read the control scheme in the options menu. The first boss you are tasked with offers nothing different from the normal tracks, you are only required to press one additional key four or five times.\n\nOnce I finished this fight, I was quite excited to play with my own music in the "Beat Your Music" mode, but it was only a huge dissapointment. In order to play with your music, you must set the settings yourself and "Find the Beat" by pressing space while the game makes you listen to a few seconds of your selected song. The result is not accurate, not at all. The game seems to place the keys you must press at random, and the flow is all over the place. Unlike the story mode songs, which are fun and on track with the beat, this is not fun at all to play. Oh, and did I mention your must do this for every single song you want to play? If you're like me and have a library of over 2000 songs you want to listen to and play, you'll have to spend 2 or 3 minutes per song having to set the beat which will most likely not even fit with what you're listening while you play.\n\nOther than this, the game has little else to offer. There is an endless mode, which most score attack games have, with a little bit of character customization. There's also a secondary character in the story mode, but I honestly couldn't be bothered to play through the first character first, the game just isn't fun.\n\nThe Strong ||\n- Good visuals\n- Good musical tracks in Story Mode\n- Good gameplay in the Story Mode\n\nThe Weak ||\n- Way too much colors on the screen\n- Unintuitive controls\n- Playing your own music feels like a chore\n- The gameplay while in "Beat your Music" is not on time and does not feel natural\n- Aside from Story Mode, there is little else","June 20, 2014","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WonderGamer/recommended/255370/","WonderGamer","WonderGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WonderGamer/","1744 products in account","The Good:\nI would recommend this game just because it's well made & has a good selection of music.  The game is also a challenge; while I can't say I'm huge on extreme challenges, some people may enjoy the game for this.  The cutscene kill screens are always a joy also.\n\nThe Bad:\nI can't say much for the movies in the game.  The game is using a sort of slideshow animation for the movies with hand-painted art; there is some humor in there however, this[www.twitch.tv] would be one example (spoiler warning).  The game is obviously an XBOX port as controller support appears to be limited to just the XBOX controllers.\n\nThere's also a rebinding bug where rebinding the keys doesn't specifically unbind the original button.  Let's say you try to rebind an arrow key to a power-up option; what happens is when you press the button to use the power-up, you inadvertently attack in the direction that that button was originally assigned to, causing a miss & break in your combo.  I was literally only using power-ups after getting hit when I realized this was happening & how important combos were to gaining a high score until I finally decided to change the controls from what I would have rather used to something else because Zen wouldn't even respond to the bug thread[forum.zenstudios.com] about it.\n\nThe Ugly:\nThe game does not have proper beat detection for imported music.  If you're looking to get this game because it claims importation of your own music (which was my reason for purchasing it), don't make the same mistake I did.  The game makes you specify the BPM (beat per minute) as well a beat start point.  It does come with a tool to help you calculate it, but it's purely you hitting button listening to the first 15 seconds of the song.  Furthermore, the import tool has a cutoff at 6 minutes, so anything longer gets cut off & you don't get the remainder of the song.  So really all your getting is a fight based off of your own specifications that you can fight to your choice of music, I can't see that fights are generated from the song itself whatsoever.  I did try some random variables once, but the attacking enemies didn't match up with the song at all.  A video of how this works can be found here[www.twitch.tv].\n\nUPDATE: I have been discussing this with an ex-employee of Zen which ended up turning into a rather ugly situation because they wanted to take the short route & say proper beat detection wasn't possible.  A thread of this conversation can be found here[forum.zenstudios.com].\n\nUPDATE:  Fixed links to videos on Twitch; seems the video IDs changed somewhere down the line & I didn't realize it until I was entering information on my Twitch channel about the game with my review here on Steam being one of those links.","May 11, 2014","true","70.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

Surprise, surprise, it does not help, and people with a sense of rythm suffer. The only way towin is to rely on visual cues - and that makes life hardly easier, because even on basic difficulty the screen becomes a cluster-F of colors and moving objects, FAST. Add in camera position that actually obscures some of the important areas to look out for, and you're set.\n\nTo clarify my position: a good beatmania game, like the aforementioned classic DDR, has two ways of telling you when to take action - either "by look" or "by feel". "Feel" comes from rythm, sound and the general pattern of actions (i.e. steps or keypresses). "Look" is there for you if you're more into visual cues - they are right on the screen, presented clearly, and unobstructed by anything else. You can use either one, or a combination of both, to achieve the same results.\n\nThis game fails BOTH.\nAdding insult to injury, the "play your own track" section is locked until you are late into the story mode - and, apparently, there is no "plug and play" in that mode (unlike, oh say, Audiosurf), everything has to be adjusted manually.\n\nMy bottom line is this: do not waste your money, even at bargain prices.","December 12, 2014","false","0.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Almost the entire playlist is nerd-rock, some guy with personal issues screaming into a mic as if he is trying to dislodge something from his throat - which is fine if you like that sort of thing I suppose.\n\nIf you don't like it however then don't be suckered in by the thought that you might be able to play with your own music. You *CAN* do it, but it requires you to mark your own beats manually rather than having software do it for you and do you really want to spend half an hour just to play a rythm game for ONE song? Furthermore you actually have to play through the story missions in order to unlock the mode for using your own music too, so no hope there either.\n\nThe cutscenes found an aesthetic somewhere but marred it with poorly arranged cinematics, and on top of that I found the humour lacking - probably because the voice actors sounded so utterly bored out of their skulls in dialogue.\n\nOh, and if you were hoping for actual rhythm in a rhythm game then you may be disappointed too, for four or five times on average during a song you will be thrown off your pacing because of a pre-animated takedown occuring (of which there are only about eight varieties).\n\nIf you like rhythm games on steam then stick to Symphony or Audiosurf. I loved Castlestorm but this game feels like a flop to me. :(","January 20, 2014","false","1.4"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

You will have to manually click space or Y button (on xbox controller) for 45 seconds to show the game how beats work for this particular song of yours... I gave up on it fast enough.

It is challenging, requires concentration, and rewards practice that you put into it. The action that takes place on screen is super smooth, and I have come to love the 24-track soundtrack, which features rap and dance music primarily.\n\nThe game's difficulty is pretty fair. The PC version has got beat markers to aid you on all difficulty settings (this can be turned off if you so please). The Vita version was criticized because it only had beat markers on the lowest of the 4 difficulty settings.\n\nOnce you get into rhythm, it's nice to be chaining together hundreds of enemies in one go, and it can be exhilarating. There's lots of stuff to unlock, the achievements are really well done here to spur you on as well, and not to mention the leaderboards if you wanna aim for global domination.\n\nA couple of complaints that I have:\n\n- Can be difficult to use keyboard at higher difficulty settings (hard to press three keys at once when three red enemies spawn together, and keyboard ghosting can become an issue)\n- Beat Your Music mode is lacklustre. It is a very flat experience because the game doesn't detect when the music is climaxing (or the chorus), and the tempo of enemies do not increase accordingly.\n\nAll in all, this is definitely a hearty recommendation to get the game, irrespective of whether you're a die-hard rhythm game fan or someone completely new to the genre.","January 18, 2014","true","44.7"," 24 of 95 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","24","95","0","0"

It's definitely not the worst but I find it hard to recommend it to anyone. Hopefully Zen Studios' next non-pinball game turns out better than this.\n\nRather than showing the player what buttons to push in the typical Guitar Hero or DDR manner the game instead surrounds you with enemies whom you have to beat up in time with the music. This would be a great mechanic but I feel that the visuals are far too distracting and severely hinder your ability to stay in sync with the music. However, if you were to take out these distracting fighting visuals then you would only be left with slow and boring button pushing gameplay with very little substance.\n\nI'm pretty sure that this game would be equally frustrating both for experienced players and beginners alike. Being able to play several other rhythm games in the hardest difficulty will NOT bode well for you in this game. It's almost as if the game punishes you for having a good sense of rhythm and it ultimately made me feel as if I were rhythmically challenged. It always seems like a constant struggle to visually predict which enemies will appear in beat with the song and I can hardly tell what is going of half of the time. If you're like me and enjoy shredding awesome fake guitar solos on your keyboard/plastic guitar then stay far away from this game. If you're just looking for a simple four button rhythm game then I suggest you to play Stepmania if you haven't already.

It's a little forgiving, but not much, and you can't really tell how badly you're doing and when the game is about to be over. There's a lot to keep track of. Most of the music tracks don't seem that straightforward for when you have to hit the button. The lighting is nightclub style, but the game gives you some help - once you realise it. The most obivous is that the enemy walks over a big coloured Y/X/B/A symbol, but it's up to you to get the timing right. Not as easy as you think. It gets a little easier when you realise enemies have a white outline around them when they're about to strike.\n\nBut between the nightclub lighting, the buttons not being where you expect, the white outlines being in different areas, some of the music not having clear spots to keep in time - you need a lot of focus to play the game.\n\nThere's a story to the game as well, but it's not fantastic and I didn't care to pay attention to it. Better story and shorter songs might have kept my attention better, I dunno. It's the kind of the game I'd play once in a while because it's a niche concept.

It's too hard to rely on the music because as soon as you adjust to the rhythm of one section the game suddenly decides to follow a completely different pattern that has nothing to do with the section you just played, and you start missing because you didn't expect that change. It feels like playing a rhythm game without rhythm, just mashing buttons randomly with no relation to the music!\n\nSometimes it feels like the song has nothing to do with the attack timings whatsoever. You can even play it with your sound muted, since the game just forces you to either rely on the visual hints or to remember the sequences. You would think it's lag, but it's not: half of a song can be perfectly in tune, following an easily recognisable pattern, and then it just changes the pattern to whatever it feels like.\n\nMusic feels rather generic, mostly because there is not enough variety of genres. Swarming groups of enemies make it impossible to determine what the next wave will be like, unless you already know that from previous attempts. Visual effects are too pronounced and they often make it hard to actually see what's going on, which is especially irritating when the colour of the floor matches the enemies and there are too many of them to see which one is going to attack first.","January 20, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the random crashes take away from the experience and importing music into the Beat Your Music mode may be a bit too involved for some.\n\nI reccomend this, but beware the crashes.\n\n(Side note, I'm using a Radeon HD 6850 card to play this game.

It looks good, as long as you turn off the dynamic camera, and plays well but can be quite a chaotic mess to follow sometimes. And it has a story. That you can skip.\n\nWhen you start up this game, for the love of god, play the tutorial. Although it is quite similar to certain rhythm games, like Dance Dance Revolution, there is one mechanic that I haven't in other of these types of games. But let's start with the basics: You are standing in the middle while the enemies start to circle you. You have to hit these enemies on the rhythm of the music. The better you perform the higher the score. However, you can make mistakes and quite a lot of them too. As well, certain can have power ups, and you'd need to double tap the button in order to get the power ups. It's not truly necessary, but to get five stars on all stages it definitely will be. Having done 1 playthrough of both story modes, Mei being played on a harder setting, I managed to get through it and never lost once. Mind you, I played it on the easier settings, with 2 other difficulty settings being harder.\n\nYou could also create your own music to challenge... but only if you have a good grasp of the rhythm of it, since the game doesn't seem to be able to create the beat on its own. I have to try that myself, but I hope it can do a better job than I can, since I tend to play tracks that are off beat by a lot.\n\nOverall, the game plays well and is very responsive. The tracks present in the game are quite good to play this game to... But like I said, the game can also throw you into a bad loop.\n\nThere's chaos in this game sometimes, depending on the track you play. While it looks pretty good, the graphics can also screw you over. That is why I suggest to turn off dynamic camera, since it can throw off your rhythm if you tend follow it and look at the screen. At one point, I couldn't figure out where I was supposed to push a button or two simultaneously because it was that busy. Maybe I should only look at the buttons on screen though, see if that works. But beware if you actually are going to play this game.\n\nThe story mode is for unlocking other modes as well as another character. You really don't need to follow that story at all, since it's quite shallow. Most rhythm games don't even have a story, you just go and get your rhythm on. Luckily, the cutscenes can be skipped. I'm not sure if I can unlock tracks from freeplay mode though. I'll have to see that one.\n\nI'm not sure how long the game will last for me. But if you like rhythm games, give this one a shot. I definitely did enjoy my time, even if it got frustratingly chaotic at some points.","September 13, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is not the best but its ok even though it shows on this profile that i didn't finish the whole story mode i had beaten it on a different system. The game doesnt only follow the drum beat exclusively and no where in the game does it say it does. the music might not be for everyone but if you just live through the storymode a little you can play your own music their are multiple playable characters outside the story mode which you can unlock by getting a certain amount of stars in each mode in the story so basically it forces you to get better if you want more characters. the story mode only allows you to play as two characters and if your not picky with your stars you can get through pretty quickly. When it come to the controller dont worry you dont have to press something like (Y,A) or (X,B) at the same time and if you click something else its wrong, but it does ask for an esier version which is (Y,B,A) which for those who dont use an xbox controller it is basically putting your thumb on everything except one button or finger if your using a key board or they will keep to the edges when its just two enemies. All though it is a bit hard to grasp right away this game is alright and could be fun for you beautiful rhythm lovers.

Even playing the game it functions very well minus a few intances were the game froze for a few seconds. This game has great innovation to it, I would like to recommend this game, but it has a certain flaw that I just can't overlook. I am of course talking about the custom music section, a section that promises to let you play your own music tracks, but unfortunatly you have to manually create the play track for your own music. Now this is not a bad idea for people who understand how to do it, but for people who do not though, this comes off as a BIG problem since those people can't play their own music. In conclution, this came is flawed so I can't really recommend it for what it is currently, hopefully with some updates they could add a section where the game scans the song file and automaticlly creates a track based off the difficulty the player chooses.

The story is not the best but its ok even though it shows on this profile that i didn't finish the whole story mode i had beaten it on a different system. The game doesnt only follow the drum beat exclusively and no where in the game does it say it does. the music might not be for everyone but if you just live through the storymode a little you can play your own music their are multiple playable characters outside the story mode which you can unlock by getting a certain amount of stars in each mode in the story so basically it forces you to get better if you want more characters. the story mode only allows you to play as two characters and if your not picky with your stars you can get through pretty quickly. When it come to the controller dont worry you dont have to press something like (Y,A) or (X,B) at the same time and if you click something else its wrong, but it does ask for an esier version which is (Y,B,A) which for those who dont use an xbox controller it is basically putting your thumb on everything except one button or finger if your using a key board or they will keep to the edges when its just two enemies. All though it is a bit hard to grasp right away this game is alright and could be fun for you beautiful rhythm lovers. I hope this helps i just want to clear up some missunderstandings that some reviews had and also give my opinion to this game","April 5, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many of the tracks i didn't really know and though i wouldn't enjoy the game becasue of it. That wasn't true at all. I played this game using a 360 controller and i feel it provided a better experience than the mouse and keyboard method and would recommended using one if possible. So the game...In the beginning it was actually kind of difficult, but after playing only a few tracks i got the hang of it, and after you do i recommend switching to hard or higher difficulty as the game on lower levels is far to easy and somewhat boring. The tracks themselves are quite good and diverse, and provide a good challenge in-game. But all of the tracks by "EnV" are far too easy even on the highest difficulty. But that's ok because they are still very good tracks. i honestly didn't bother with the story until the end cutscene for both Lee and Mei's Stories and honestly for a rhythm game i didn't even need a story line. But all in all the game is very good and i recommend it. It has great playtime for the price and the gameplay is great once you get used to it. You might even find a new song or two you'll love.\n*At this point i haven't messed around with the using your own songs feature because the songs provided are good for me.","January 25, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Guitar Hero to mention one can actually be followed through listening to the song aswell as having a good reaction and it isnt SO hard anymore.. so i applied my knowledge of that here thinking it would be the same. i managed the story to Stage 2 before i failed Utterly. i made it maybe past 50% then i just failed miserably.. literally miserably. Really demotivational.. and i thought to myself.. this is on Normal Difficulty, wich means the easiest.. so it cant be the game, i have to do something wrong or just be out of sync or SOMETHING.. so i went back to the Tutorial even though i understood all of it, and i got all the info, and it isnt exactly Game Training as much as Relaying Info on whats what. so i figured okay im not getting much Training in Training Mode.. so i might aswell go back and Fail some more and hopefully Climb Ontop of my Excessive Fails until i reach the top :D. so i did.. i found it.. Extremely hard to FOllow the " beat " in even the first few songs.. as if the game ACTUALLY didnt Follow the BEAT.. but it followed its OWN beat with the songs Addon regarding a few of the " mobs " attacking you.. so MAINLY its own Beat, then added song beat to back it up.. now when i realized this i got kinda sad.. thinking how on earth am i gunna follow this all if i cant follow the song a 100% ???. but i kept trying.. still thinking it was something that i did. after a while of heavy excessive Failing i just was so fed up with this. i love the music, graphics everything except the actual Musical Beat you're SUpposed to follow but in truth cant. its very visible many times and you can both see and hear the beat there.. like in Training mode. but the songs isnt as Simple as the Training mode.. Normal Difficulty doesent let you get more than..2 seconds MAX breathing space between every button click. Literally 2 seconds MAX breathing room. wich gives VERY little time for beginners to see the Color of the attacker.. wich way they will come from regarding button Up,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT to push.. also listen to the beat.. View the attackers Color but also ALL the other thats near you to see who belongs to who and who will attack you together or solo.. and u have to COmbine ALLLL of these together AT-THE-SAME-TIME. especially when the game isnt following the beat 100%. Extremely Frustrationg for Casual players that doesent want to spend more than necessery energy on playing a game nor practicing one that gives over 50% frustration rather than reward. just isnt worth it plain and simple. not to mention the game itself is VERY restricting.. the only choices u get from start is Story mode - Training Mode - Survival Mode. In survival mode you cant even CHANGE the difficulty, so forget using that to practice for beginners xD no chance.. Training mode isnt Training mode. its Teaching Mode. wich leaves Story mode and its frustration left.. also there is Free play mode too but its been LOCKED from the player until u reach a certain point in the story.. i mean wth.. you're seriously Locking " FREE " play mode ?? isnt that the entire point for it to be open to play on any time unconditionally or to setup your own Game at any time " Freely " ??.. apparently not. also you see a Male and a Female, they both look awesome. when they Introduced this picture and everything showing off male female, i had the First impression that you could play as either male or female. you cant. you have to Unlock her through Story first and then you can play as her. wich sucks because it requires Decent Skill in this frustration to even go past 1st boss wich is Stage 4 at Marilyn Manson song. Also forget about Refunds. the game has such a foothold that when you buy this its done. Dug your own grave xD. cant get a Refund. However if you like this game or consider buying it, i'd say if you're REally into these sort of games its definitly worth a shot and see if you can make it. if not, then its another Shelf game.

The gamplay itself it is very simple but can get difficult on harder levels creating challenges for those who have mastered the easy level. There is a "Beat your own music" option which allows you to use your own songs and and BMP calulator to play the game to your songs. This mode is missing the ability to change tempo through out the song, so the tempo at the start is the same the whole way through which can lead to enemys coming off beat later in songs.

Where to start.\n\nFirst off, I give this game a recommendation only based on its uniqueness and potential to have been expanded upon. If anything, consider it a case study of rhythm games. In this case, we look upon what can be used to expand upon a simple concept like DDR/Stepmania and turn it into something with serious charm. I want as many people to see what this game has tried so that that future generations of indie/small-dev rhythm games can stand to benefit.\n\nConsider Kickbeat to be like Stepmania. There are four directional button presses that have to be hit in time to the music. Where Kickbeat differs is assigning power-ups to directional double taps that are also assigned in accordance to the music. Adding to that, Kickbeat also throws in a Star Power element called Chi from the 'Hero' games, except it's built from regular successful note presses and reduced with damage. Power-ups can include things like bonus points, a Chi meter boost, health, invincibility, bombs, and even an extra multiplier. This is a bold change, since all these powerups are assigned with the music and not randomly, but they are entirely optional in the midst of actually completing a song or staying alive. It allows the ability to create serious high score challenges with countless accurately timed button presses without forcing insane clusters of missable (and thus, song-failing) notes that makes some Stepmania custom tracks infuriating. Kickbeat also enforces an honest penalty for button mashing. Making too many hits into air will cause your character to become fatigued, forcing them to be take a few hits of their own for a while on top of killing your score multiplier.\n\nOn top of all that, Kickbeat comes equipped with a simple story, a bit on the generic side, but not without its moments. but the core of the game overall is the visualizer. Kickbeat relays its otherwise simple core design by turning you into a lone man (or woman) beset by hordes of hostile enemies, all of whom need to be dispatched. This along with the dynamic camera movement, cinematic section finishers to fill lulls in the music, and the occasional boss fight makes a game that's as fun to watch as it is to play as opposed to certain other titles with colored arrows or dots.\n\nMost of the above is a shining example of how to improve on existing rhythm game styles, but unfortunately Kickbeat suffers from a good share of problems that keep it from making a breakout into PC Rhythm Games. For one, the system requirements are a bit undersold. I run a computer with a bit over the recommended specs, but even on its lowest visuals, would get slowdowns and the occasional lockup. Adding on top of that is graphic tweaking is very minimal in Kickbeat's interface with no way of reducing particle effects or maximum size of the horde hovering around your character (new ones exceeding the maximum are phased in anyway, so it serves little purpose until you reach the closing moments where the numbers dwindle out). Crashes are also likely, which can cause SEVERE frustration when it comes to high-scoring songs for stars to unlock bonus characters and costumes, only for the game to crash. Next up is the fact that Kickbeat, even while labeled Steam Edition, does not play nice with the Steam overlay. Popups from friends entering games/coming online/IMs, groups hosting events, and even Kickbeat's own achievements can cause the game to grind to a halt or even crash it.\n\nAs for the key selling point of musically generated gameplay, heralded among the likes of Audiosurf, Beat Hazard, and Symphony, Kickbeat falls very short in this regard. The only parameters it seems to check in a song is BPM and when the initial beat starts, outside of an unusual tool that assists by having you tap out the beat yourself, making each added song a chore to make work, and even then, remains inconsistent in what beats it chooses to focus on as notes. There's no custom tracking, like one would have seen from Stepmania's track creator, so your level of enjoyment vs annoyance is entirely reliant on how well the tool works for you, never mind songs with variable or escalating BPM throughout that make that assigned number unreliable.\n\nLastly, the unfortunate truth is that the number of pre-programmed tracks only sits at 24 total songs, from 13 total artists. After a year of being released, it's disappointing that Zen Studios couldn't even bother with some DLC of track packs, maybe some extra stories, venues, or character costumes to go with it (perhaps even a larger library of cinematic takedowns). Perhaps they might be working on a sequel, given Kickbeat's awarded accolades, possibly even addressing all the issues I and others have listed here.\n\nIn conclusion, Kickbeat is worth picking up, but only if it's on sale. With the current problems it faces, there's just not that much replayability. Sure, the cosmetic unlockables add a nice flavor when unlocked, but after all the pre-programmed tracks are finished, the track generating tool is too tedious to bother with, compared to simple scan-and-play systems that other games deal with. The clear software issues push it over the edge, which becomes devastating in modes like Survival, that hinge on your methaphorical game ship holding together long enough for the respective Steam achievements, which alone will bear a threat when they slow your game upon being achieved.\n\nOverall, I repeat: My recommendation comes as a case study. This game had a lot of potential that didn't get used, and I feel its contributions shouldn't be overlooked. Whatever serves as Kickbeat's spiritual successor doesn't necessarily have to be a kung-fu rhythm game visualizer, but should keep the spirit of optional notes, score building methods, subtle casual inclusion, and a visualizer that makes the game stylish and visually involved","February 26, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, it isn't a bad rhythm game by any means.  Basic gameplay is pretty typical of games like DDR, where you press buttons representing Up, Down, Left, and Right when enemies move into the appropriate area.  You also have a couple of Guitar Hero style features: an overdrive mode that when charged lets you increase your score multiplier, and a button to activate powerups like a shield that protects you from misses briefly.\n\nThis game also has a decently neat feature in that some enemies have items floating over their heads - to actually get the item you have to double-tap the button instead of single-tap.  This is how you get the aforementioned powerups, and these items also include bonus points and score multiplier increases.\n\nAesthetically, the game is pretty good - the animations are neat, the enemies look good, and I've enjoyed the included music tracks that I've played (though of course your mileage may vary).  This all can get in the way of the gameplay, however.  Screen shakes, circling enemies, and poor indicators of which enemy is going to hit first make the game more difficult than other traditional rhythm games.\n\nOverall, not a bad rhythm game, it just adds some Kung Fu game style to the model we're all pretty familiar with.  I was looking for an action game with strong rhythm elements, and was disappointed.  But if you're looking for a Rhythm game with added flavor, I'd probably recommend this.  It gets a "Yes."","January 28, 2014","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do love rhythm games, played a lot of them  (Ōendan, Rhythm Tengoku, Taiko no Tatsujin, Theatrhythm, Jam With the Band, Parappa the Rapper, Stepmania, DJ Max, etc.) but this one fails miserably to entertain me. In my opinion, the game's biggest flaw is clarity. You gotta use your eyes to see which enemy is where and if he has a power-up above its head, meaning you gotta punch him twice, but it's so messy that everybody is hiding everybody. As if it wasn't enough frustrating, sometimes the camera zooms in and far, messing with your visual cues. Half the time, when I was playing correctly, I didn't even had the feeling that I was doing something on the beat. And on top of that, it's not even fun to punch the enemies because there is zero feeling of power and it ain't doing cool things to watch. I really tried to like the game, but nope, I can't stand it anymore, it's dull. If you want to play a cool kung-fu game, immediatly try One Finger Death Punch, and otherwise, if you want a cool rhythm game, play anything else from the few I listed above, or plenty others.","August 11, 2015","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is not the best but its ok even though it shows on this profile that i didn't finish the whole story mode i had beaten it on a different system. The game doesnt only follow the drum beat exclusively and no where in the game does it say it does. the music might not be for everyone but if you just live through the storymode a little you can play your own music their are multiple playable characters outside the story mode which you can unlock by getting a certain amount of stars in each mode in the story so basically it forces you to get better if you want more characters. the story mode only allows you to play as two characters and if your not picky with your stars you can get through pretty quickly. When it come to the controller dont worry you dont have to press something like (Y,A) or (X,B) at the same time and if you click something else its wrong, but it does ask for an esier version which is (Y,B,A) which for those who dont use an xbox controller it is basically putting your thumb on everything except one button or finger if your using a key board or they will keep to the edges when its just two enemies. All though it is a bit hard to grasp right away this game is alright and could be fun for you beautiful rhythm lovers.

Great rhythm game, never have any problems following the rhythm of the songs I'm playing.  Great animation and textures on everything, making for a very pretty game.  The only thing I'd caution is that the camera is very disorienting at times.  It was most noticeable, for me, on the first level of the tokyo rooftop section.  The camera zooms in and out in time with the music for effect, but it makes it very difficult to keep track of where your enemies are, which was annoying as hell for me.  When the camera is zoomed out, it becomes significantly harder to differentiate things, which becomes an exponentially larger problem depending on the speed of the track.\n\n9/10 Good game\n\n(Sidenote, if you're avidly against loud metal/hard rock music, don't buy this title.

Yes, it can feel unfair at times, switching what part of the song you are playing along to, but as you learn the songs, you get used to it and know what is coming.

Game is also overpriced at 9,99 euros. I got mine and 7 other games from HumbleBundle for 4.67$ which lands the cost/game at 59 cents, which is probably why I felt that the game I got was worth the money.\nTo conclude, the game itself is pretty good, but not worth more than 1 euro. Anything more and it's not worth buying.","July 8, 2015","false","40.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Short story: KickBeat is awesome.\n\nThe long story is that the game has some major interface design flaws and suffers from instability.  For starters, controller support on the menu is very limited.  The Steam overlay does not work within the game, even though there is achievement support and the game clearly promotes the achievement pop-up notification.  The game's custom track system is a little confusing to navigate and not quite as comfortable to use as the interface found in Melody's Escape.  Also, the game crashes quite frequently - at least for me - after reaching the Turkish Bath stage.\n\nThe gameplay is what really counts here, though, right?  Well, controllers are supported very well in the game itself, and the control scheme is simple yet satisfying.  I enjoyed the story mode more than custom tracks, and the fact that there's actually a decent kung-fu fantasy story in this game is a major plus to me.  However, again, the game likes to crash.  Its instability ruins the fun too often.  That said, I enjoyed the game a lot in the beginning and think you may enjoy it even more if it doesn't crash for you.\n\nThe game's performance seems fine at lower difficulties on early levels, but the framerate jitters a little at the later stages for no reason at all.  I played up to Hard mode and did not notice a framerate drop on early levels at all.  That said, it would be wise to make sure you have a medium range or higher gaming rig to play this game on.\n\nOverall, the game's worth getting if you like rhythm games at all, but don't buy it at full price.  The frequent and unexplained crashes alone warrant waiting for a deep discount before buying.","June 30, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am a fan of rhythm games, but this one was difficult for me to track what I'd need to hit next because you have to track the little dudes as they move around you. It probably would be easy but I found myself wanting to watch the kung-fu - not watching to see what I need to hit next.","May 27","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think whether you like the music selection or not, it does kind of fit with the theme of punching millions of dudes and makes for an enjoyable experience in small bursts.\n\nHigh points for me in the soundtrack include Marilyn Manson's "Beautiful People" and Pendulum's "Self vs Self" collaboration with In Flames, which fit with the gameplay very well. Low points include everything else, which is varying degrees of very similar ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that will do your head in.\n\nI probably wouldn't buy it by itself but as bundle filler it's worth a look if you've nothing else to do with an evening.\n\n","January 10","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
