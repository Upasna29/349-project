I have been given a key by the publisher/developer and decided to give this game a detailed review because I enjoyed it.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=625132584\nPoints of interestAs far as I am aware, there isn’t a story behind the game, so it’s up for interpretation.\n\nThere are 5 zones, each with 8-10 levels. You can take shortcuts and skip certain levels by following diverging paths. There are 6 different level types, indicated by white circles with varying icons. Beginner levels, gate levels, multiplayer levels, water levels, space levels, and regular levels indicated by a plain white circle.\n\nThe goal of each level is to build a structure or assisting framework to reach an indicated point (and stay balanced for 2-3 seconds). As well as level types, there are also different block types. There are blocks that explode, blocks that cannot be picked up, and blocks that are breakable. In order to reach your target, you have to use your avatar to pick up shapes and arrange them in a certain manner. Most of the puzzles are easy and straightforward, but others are much more difficult and some are influenced by various environmental factors.\n\nMy favorite part of this game is the multiplayer levels. Indicated by an asterisk (*), multiplayer levels have complicated puzzles that require help from other players to solve. The only way to communicate is by using one word chat messages which you can unlock as you progress. These messages can be translated into 19 different languages, eliminating communication barriers.  By working together you can move heavy objects and make complicated structures that would not be possible if you were working by yourself.\n\nOne of the only cons that I can think of is the price tag and content. $12 for a couple hours of gameplay is a lot to ask. Sadly, I can only recommend this game on sale at its current state. If more content is added, the price could be more justified.\n\nThere is also a mobile version which is $4 on the apple and android store. According to their website, a PS4, PS vita, and possibly Wii U version will also be released shortly.\nSummaryOverall, I am really impressed with what this game had to offer, even if it lacks some content. Some of the strong points are the cross-platform multiplayer, level variety, simplistic puzzles.\n\nMy implemented rating system:Run away! 1-2/10\nHandle with caution… 3-4/10\nBuy on sale: 5-6/10\nEvery day purchase: 7-8/10Must buy: 9-10/10\n\nThis game’s rating: 6.5/10. I want to give it a 7 or 8, but at the current price, I can’t. If you are not worried about the price and just want to have an interesting experience, I recommend this game for you. http://store.steampowered.com/app/298420\nAny constructive feedback is appreciated!","February 15","true","5.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"
