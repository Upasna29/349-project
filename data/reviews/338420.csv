"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/recommended/338420/","erbkaiser","Erbkaiser ♔","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/","4510 products in account","Alum is a beautiful game.\n\nEverything fits together perfectly here, from the retro-pixel art style characters and foreground elements, to the hand-drawn painted backgrounds, to the well done voice acting, to the beautiful original music.\n\nGameplay is very much like the old Sierra and Lucasarts adventures, with the controls updated for a modern age: you can toggle between the (few, smart) actions with right-clicking, and scroll through your inventory items with the mouse wheel, so there is no need to constantly refer to the hotbar. The option is there though for people who prefer to play that way.\n\nPuzzles in the game range from extremely straightforward to very challenging, but it never gets unfair. I was stuck at several points but for that the game has a built-in hints system. The hints given are never spoilers, instead just pointers to the right direction.\n\nThere are also some timed action scenes. The most difficult ones can be skipped, the game will offer this option after a few failures. But I think they're all doable.\n\nThe story in Alum is phenomenal. The main character goes through a full heroic journey, starting out as a nobody in a big city and becoming a true hero. Through the tale you pass through multiple locations, all very different but definitely fitting in the same world, and encounter a large cast of supporting characters and opponents, all again with their own voice.\nThe story managed to surprise me several times, and also made me smile a lot. It isn't afraid to pull punches, either. Lighthearted moments lead to emotionally shocking scenes where you really feel the loss... fortunately there is a happy ending, for those who can make it that far.\n\nAlum really surprised me. I went in expecting a decent indie adventure game but what I found is one of the best games I've played in years. It is obvious that the developers had a real love for the game and they managed to deliver an almost perfect gaming experience.\n\nI enjoyed every second I spent playing this game.","May 16, 2015","true","14.0"," 53 of 61 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","53","61","2","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arkbit/recommended/338420/","arkbit","rG|Arkane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arkbit/","192 products in account","Oh boy.\n\nOkay, let's start with just the game mechanics.  This is a point and click inventory-based adventure game.  There are only a couple of puzzles that take more than a minute or two to think about (the sequence on the boat comes to mind.)  In this regard, it's fun and rather intuitive.  However, many of the puzzles are rather inelegant.  By this I mean that elements of the puzzle-solving process are thrown in your face in such a way that it feels like you're reading a walkthrough.  This is not 'bad', and it's certainly not the whole game.  Why do I bring this up?  Because that lack of subtlety and feeling of being bashed over the head repeats itself in every aspect of the game.\n\nBut before I go through that, let's talk about art and music.  There are some really stunning moments.  The Vivit Oak seems like a place I'd love to visit.  There are one or two songs in the game that made me just pause and listen.  I want to bring this up before I complain any more, since it's a really strong aspect of the game.\n\nRegarding every other aspect of the game - only play this if you're comfortable being forcefed religion.  It becomes apparent by the second chapter that this is a Christian game.  There is no good option but the one that is suggested by god.  You have an item that is essentially a direct line to god, and there are portions of the game where the solution to every puzzle is to ask god.  You wave your godcellphone in peoples' faces, and suddenly they see the light and are devoted to god.  God god god god god god.  The hero of the story isn't even the hero.  God is.  God sorta used some characters to share his godlove and godgod.  God!\n\nI don't mean to bash this game or its developers.  I think it's great to have games that aren't afraid to connect with their version of spirituality.  The problem I have with this game is the same that I have with certain branches of Christian music; it's like drinking tea that has been steeping for approximately 38 years.  You don't have to lay it on so thick that it blots out the sun.  First it consumed the mechanics.  I had fun in the Vivit Oak.  The Rogation base was a little sloppy.  From that point on, I realized that god was the solution to every puzzle and I breezed through the rest of the game in an hour or so.  Then the heavy-handed religion swallowed up the storyline.  Toward the end, it was just people jackknifing between apostle and sinner.  The desire to show that god is love and light was so strong that character motivation and growth came to a screeching halt.  The 'main character' had a moment near the end where he acted in a way that wasn't precisely expected.  This is potentially a strong element to a story.  However, his reasons for doing so make no sense at all in the context.  It's hard to describe without spoilers, but I'll try: it's like walking across town to a bagel shop, then when you get there, marching in and going, "The walk to this bagel shop took so long that now I hate bagels!"  I know what was trying to be conveyed, but it was so damn clumsy.\n\nIf I had to describe this in one word, that would be it: clumsy.  Not bad, just clumsy.  I hope the team that worked on this will expand a little bit, bring in some people with different perspectives.  Maybe have someone there whose only job is to say, "Hey, that story element you just wrote?  Maybe we should find a more subtle approach to implementing it."  I'm not saying, "Don't make a religious game."  I'm saying don't get caught in an echo chamber of religious ideas and lose sight of the 'game' aspects of it.  And as for the potential buyer, take a moment and ponder your tolerance for being beat over the head with religious ideals.  If it's not your 38-year-old cup of tea, then pass on this one.","August 15, 2015","false","6.7"," 68 of 90 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","68","90","4","0"

The music is wonderful, the background animations are lovely and if you enjoy that "retro" look, you will enjoy playing Alum. For a first game, Crashable  Studios is to be commended.\n\nThe story is heavily allegorical and to the game's credit, you figure that out early in Chapter 2. Several reviewers have commented on the Christian overtones being too ham fisted at times and I think that they may well have a point. Depending on your own preferences, you may find the story too heavy handed. My own opinion was they presented the story using well agreed upon arguments that shouldn't get people too riled up. Free will, forgiveness, repentance and redemption are heavy topics and they fit it all in a 10 hour game.\n\nThe game does have a couple of points of concern. The voice acting is uneven at best. Given their modest budget and size, this is no surprise and it doesn't spoil the game but they could have gone with just text and done just as well. It appears several family members did the voice work and that is a neat thing to do so I hesitate to be too critical but it falls flat more often than not. Alum has a couple of crisis of faith, as do several other characters and the jarring move from faithful follower to doubting soul is difficult to act and sadly, the voice work doesn't always live up to delivering the required punch.\n\nThe other concern is the character development. Like real life, the heroes are flawed and their faith journey is not a straight path. In a short game, it can be difficult to guide a character through these crisis and at times it just seems the character gets their nose out of joint for no good reason! A little more exposition would probably have smoothed that over.\n\nOverall, very impressive. I hope they continue to write more games. I'll be glad to back them again if they do.","May 20, 2015","true","10.3"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

I knew the basics to what a point and click game was, but it never really intrigued me. Although everyone wants to hear a good story, nowadays they're too busy being swept into combat arenas, focusing on killing each other for points. Satisfaction? Yes, but nothing can grasp what you will carry away from playing Alum, no matter what kind of game you may play. Usually in games you experience most of the story in the cut-scenes, causing players to blow through the actual gameplay just for those sequences, but in Alum you as the player really experience the whole story 100% of the time, and watch it unfold as you turn the pages in each decision that you make. Alum has a story for everyone to relate to, making it more of your story then the actual game's story. You play as Alum, but really you're every character you meet in this whole game. They are all so unique and full of life that they leave an imprint on you. It's not even just the characters that leave an impression on you, but the actual gameplay itself is so rewarding. Even in the little things that you do you'll find yourself grinning, but even then I was already smiling beforehand from just the pure enjoyment of the game. What this game has done for me is not only leave me applying the game's story to my own life, but also open up myself to the other point and clicks out there because now I honestly want to see if there are any that are just as good as Alum. I could keep going on and talk about how awesome all the artwork, music, voiceacting, gameplay, etc. is for Alum, but I think that's something you'll have to discover yourself.","May 17, 2015","true","7.5"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","0"

Alum's wife is sick with the Vague, a disease that leads people to death by apathy: one day things change suddendly when he discovers there might be a cure for it and that the city might not be as perfect as it seems.\n\nA throwback to the adventure games of old Alum sports some interesting puzzles and some strong starting acts but sadly declines a bit in quality as it goes and suffers from some ham-fisted exposition in its storytelling: it's still a decent enough game though.\n\nPROS:\n\n-the game world, with its mixture of technology and magic, is very interesting\n\n-the story starts quite strong and sustains a good momentum in the first chapters\n\n-intuitive puzzles\n\n-you'll be meeting a wide cast of characters\n\n-full voice acting\n\n-great soundtrack\n\n-good length (6-8 hours)\n\nCONS:\n\n-the graphics and art style feel a bit barren and aren't as detailed as other contemporary adventures\n\n-some voice actors are quite poor\n\n-a few (skippable) action sequences feel a bit out of place\n\n-the last chapter of the game is quite a disaster suffering from counterintuitive puzzles (where, unlike most of the game, you're given no clues and have to proceed through frustrating trial-and-error), weird and sudden decisions from the main characters and some insipid turns in the story\n\n-last "boss" encounter feels clunky and is once more a trial-and-error affair\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=501325346\n\nAlum starts very strongly, its world is well-designed and is quite believable, there's a nice sense of intrigue as you discover the secrets behind your city and the puzzles flow nicely.\n\nOnce you hit the 6th and 7th chapters though things change, one puzzle at the end of the sixth chapter was frustrating due to some very vague clues but this gets much worse on the seventh and final chapter where you'll have to fiddle with wires or bypass a trapped floor with no clues whatsoever to help you. This means trying over and over until, by accident, you realize what the developer had in mind or just look online for help. This sudden change in puzzle design is honestly very surprising and quite a letdown considering the previous parts all had intuitive puzzles were the solution was, at times, even spoon-fed to the player.\n\nThe story also starts to rely heavily on its not-so-hidden religious overtones and while this by itself isn't a problem it becomes one when certain scenes and decisions seem to have been designed more to act as a modern parable rather than serving the actual story: in the end the narrative suffers from it as it moves from the characters' actual feelings and experiences to a somewhat ham-fisted exposition on why hope and believing in an higher being is important.\n\nDespite the disappointing finale Alum still has enough merits to be worth a playthrough though: due to the aforementioned problems I'd advise to wait for a sale or take advantage of the "pay-what-you-want" offer as long as it stands.","August 17, 2015","true","7.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I fell in love with this game just by looking at the screenshots. You will just love the gorgeous pixel-art. It was nicely done and there were just few problems with gameplay when it didn't make sense at all. But you will get used to it easily. What I liked the most about this game is the whole atmosphere. Well written stories in fantasy world are what I like. The whole plot is kind of like a "God vs Satan" reference but I didn't really mind. First thing that surprised me is that is was fully dubbed (with subtitles as well, just in case). Although few dialogues, voices and voice actors were kinda "out of place", it got better throughout the game. There are few moments where "mini-games" are put in place, so the game is not boring and all the same (even though it is not). I myself decided to skip these mini-games (which are part of story btw) because the gameplay of them was sloppy and most of the bugs I've found in this game were in these mini games. Nevertheless, it is a nice feature to have in such a game. Another thing that suprised me was length of game. I thought that it's gonna take around 3 hours to finish the game. It takes 8-9 hours, if you are not really a puzzle games lover. Talking about puzzles... The difficulty increases. At the beggining it's kind of easy mode, then it goes super hard near the end (at least for a casual gamer like me). Not gonna lie, I spent some time looking at the in-game hints and not really getting them because they were not really helpful. I'd recommend you to get this game only if you like pixel-art or point-and-click puzzle games where you sometimes need to think and act in a strange way because the devs made it so. Overall, it's a nice little hidden gem of indie games and I must say I pretty liked it.","August 4, 2015","true","9.9"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

An hour and a half  later, I was no longer playing Alum, but rather 'Jesus, Your Lord and Savior - the Bejesusing'.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm a Christian myself and am not bashing because I'm an antheist hipster. Just the way the overbearing Christian narrative is pushed in your face, without much subtlety or any game-specific adaptation and meaningful changes, feels very hamfisted. I understand the devs wanted to make a story about God and the way faith works but playing this feels exactly like being indoctrinated into some branch of protestantism and I don't feel this has a place in a point-and-click adventure game, especially one that advertises itself as something completely different.\n\nIt does the game a disservice, as the pixel art is indeed superb and the puzzles are enjoyable for the most part, without being too easy or too silly and frustrating. The theme could have been handled much more gracefully but the way it is, it feels forced and cringey, which largely ruins the fun.","May 9","false","2.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The characters typically sound inconsistent when you hear them and often it’s flat. Even if you take into account how one might sound with the “Vague” affecting them it’s still jarring. And the allegory can be a bit too “in-your-face” at times. I would have loved it to be a bit more subtle, but even so it all works in context.

I got it for $1 off of Indie Game Stand, and I wouldn't recommend it for much more than that.  As always, it is important to note that this game DOES have failstates, but checkpoints you immediately before them.\n\nThe religious element of the story is essentially christianity, with a rename on most elements and a lot of the themes still present.  This isn't prima facie bad, and it could actually be a very interesting setting for a game... if it was well written, and this game wasn't.  I would expound on this further, but as it turns out another review sums up most of my problems with the game already.  All you have are usual christian cliches of faith, persecution, redemption, forgiveness, and so forth.  The game is neither robust nor well made enough to make up for its lack of original content.  Even if we give a huge benefit of the doubt to the game and its developers in assuming that this story isn't some sort of subtle preaching and take the game at face value, the face value is pretty empty.\n\n"This game is dedicated to all of our friends and family who have gone ahead to be with the true and living Unfeigned Altruist (Jesus Christ)" is displayed at the end of the credits.  I can't help but feel that this game was written specifically for a christian audience, a story full of good values and affirmation of your beliefs so that you were supposed to nod your head along to the religious elements with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.  It wasn't written to be original.  It was written to preach.\n\nStory aside, the rest of the game isn't much good either.  The puzzles aren't particularly interesting or clever.  The characters have no charm or personality to make you feel for them, and their voice acting is mediocre and almost always lacks the right emotion for the scenes (even taking into account the game's plot point of The Vague influencing this).  Locales are not particuarly interesting nor does any of the art draw much wonder, but the music is fairly passable.\n\nIts probably best to say that the game just isn't good.  Its not abysmal in any of these categories I critique it for (voice acting being the worst of the set), but I didn't at any point crack a smile or feel like I was enjoying myself and I did give this game a fair shake.  The game is about 8.5 hours long.  Just pass, there's plenty of other point-and-click adventure games with much better content from Daedelic and Wadjet Eye you'd be much better off playing.","February 7","false","9.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

A basic Point & Click Adventure game that has a amazing story that keeps you wanting to continue through the entire game in one sitting if you have the time to. There aren't that many flaws in this game that I came across but there are still a few things that I would suggestion changing slightly.\n\nGame PlayThis game is amazing. I'm not normally for one with point and click games but this one is a exception, it has a very intriguing story (Don't worry no spoilers here) that gets you hooked in and wanting play through the entire game (I didn't because I suck at puzzle type games). Obviously, with each Point & Click come with puzzles. Let me start off by saying that the tutorial actually blends in with the story and game play, which is really good because you normally have to go through a few text boxes before you can even start playing. This game tells you how to do things then you use it at that moment. Really good idea. I found the first chapter puzzles to be pretty self-explanatory then it started to get a bit over my head and got a bit more complex. Some of the puzzles are a bit to obscure to really know that, that was what you where suppose to do. Unless you hovered your mouse of it you wouldn't of found out how to do it. There was a few occasions this happened to me while playing this game, maybe that's just because I am bad at puzzles games. There is a hint one the options page that will help you if you understand what that means. If not then you will be walking around, hovering your mouse over every area of each place. None the less this is still a amazing game, it has some witty jokes inside and doesn't go over board when it uses them.  Each chapter of the game sets a atmosphere, or a question that you don't know the answer to. That really hooked me into each chapter that I played, this combine with some really intense moments in the game really sets it up to be a brilliant atmospheric game! The small cut scenes in this game look really good, you get the feel that you really are this person and you want to help them. Again, setting a terrific atmosphere which just made me want to play it more. The pacing in this game is very well done, it starts off slow with a few questions to the game, then by the end of chapter 1 (Took me about 30 minutes) it's then faced paced! A nice little element of the game that they added that I don't see often in other Point & Click games is the ability to show where all the exits are. This really does help you because sometimes you are unsure where they are, they aren't always obvious. The writing of the story and the voices of all the characters is very nice, the story is structured really well and the words they use just grab you into the game. I found that it's structured very well right at the beginning of the game.\nScore (Out of 10): 9 - Although I would really want to give it a perfect 10, some of the puzzles are too obscure to figure out unless you have played the game before, I know it's suppose to be a puzzle game but some of the solutions to the puzzles went way over my head.\n\nGraphics/Art StyleYou can see the type of graphics that are on the game through the trailer, it has nice pixel graphics that fit the game really well. Everything looks really nice and polished for pixel graphics. I feel like this game works really well with these graphics, and the whole atmosphere you keep with you through the entire game.\nScore (Out of 10): 10 - Very well polished pixel graphics that work well with the game\n\nMusic & SoundsIn my opinion the music and sounds make the whole game how atmospheric it really is. There is very soft background music at times and every sound that you would expect to hear you would hear it, the songs that are played really suit the situations that you are in as well. It really makes you feel like you are in the game, and then when it gets to the emotional parts the music and sounds set in just right to get the most of out the game. Although I would like to hear a little more variation for the background music but that's just a little thing.\nScore (Out Of 10): 9 - Maybe some more variation in background music.\n\nConclusionThis is what a Point & Click game should be. Very atmospheric, with all the music and the sounds, nicely crafted puzzles that (in my opinion) get a bit too hard as you went along the game and the graphics set the game up to be really good, and well fitting with the music.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.","February 12","true","5.5"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

I thought it would just be a simple, pixelated, point & click adventure type game, but it's so much more than that. I felt for the character's actions and consequences. Alum captions a LucasArt's adventure game from back in the day, and that's marvelous. The pixelated graphics, the art style, is beautiful, even though it runs at a low resolution. It's able to capture the intended feel of the game's universe, a feeling of combat between good and evil. If you analyse closely Alum's story and atmosphere you find yourself comparing a lot of what's going on with religion. For example, The Unfeigned Altruist is Jesus Christ and The Invidious Umbra, can be shown as the Devil.\n\nThat's what Alum is all about, a fight between good and bad. You are Alum, a simple, normal, clumsy character that goes by everyday making daily deliveries as a job. His wife gets The Vague, a disease that's infecting everyone in Kosmos, a major city where the game starts. Alum is prepared to do everything to save his wife.\n\nThe question is, are you ready to lead Alum through this amazing adventure that features action, love, ice giants and references to Sniper Elite, Pacific Rim and Da Vinci's Demons? I think you are. So go ahead, buy this game, enjoy it's twists and turns, and I'll see you in my next review.","October 28, 2015","true","8.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

So could treat it as a concept in the axioms inside the story, and not as a real meta truth which i believe it not to be, but could be as true as it liked in pixel land.\n\nAlthough i was continually irked by the weak character devolpment, and ♥♥♥♥ easy puzzles just to have everyone advance the blisteringly obviouse Christion allegory, and to what gain?? To win over a small amount of maybie Athiest or agnostic retro pont n click enthusiasts.\n\nIt had no charm as a story unto itself, and got more and more bogged down with the bigger  accompyning 'wink wink' that the aulterist is actually God/Jesus, until it was unbearabley foie grase'd down your throat. It killed it, as every character was just a sound byte for that single Linear interest, which was an advert for the big bearded one.\n\nOther characters where so suddenly shoe horned in to make a puzzle work it lacked all grace (ironically), or just used as a late hash attempt for some story to push forward the tepid narrative. Any result or drama surrounding them didnt matter to me a jot, and who voiced one of the kids a 20 yr old latin male? If they toned it down with the hard Jesus sell it could of still been good with a Christian template, it could of still of been enjoyed by thiest and Athiest a like, perhaps for the same reasons..a good story and game.\n\nUnfortunatly the perpetual and ever increasing convertion intention, felt like accidently walking in to a Christian support group, or a street evangalising session all weakly clandestine behined a luke warm fantasy setting'. This made me want out the game, i didnt want to be lectured too on something i disagree with, as its purpose seemed to do that, kudos on not mentioning the obviouse simularity until the credits though, then the final slower folk could finally see it.\n\nPaying for it, forced me to see it through as a result, and did make me see how totally contradictory ,bizzare and emotionally selfish faith was, and for that, it was an interesting venture. Next time its best to put a 'Christian game' clearely if its going to lecture in it, as this game will either preach to the already converted and just put everyone else off.

The graphics are pixelated a bit more than a lot of retro stuff, but if you're an old school adventure gamer, that shouldn't bother you too much. The audio is fine for what it is, but the voice acting is... not good. In fact, it's pretty lousy. You can tell most, if not all, of the voice actors are amateurs or first-timers. Still, the puzzles aren't bad, although after the first chapter, they've been bordering on too easy. The story, however, is where the game shines. It's something of a dystopia futuristic city setting, but there are enough odd elements to make it feel a bit fresher than average. There have been a few weird twists so far that have kept me guessing too, trying to figure out exactly what the heck is going on. I'm willing to put up with the games other weaknesses just because I'm so intrigued by the story. And for five bucks, it's not too painful of a purchase. Alum is a mixed bag, but on balance, it's decent enough to recommend.","March 4","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very disappointed. We WERE really excited to play a traditional point and click, enough that we tried to overlook the godawful writing (seriously, why don't indie game makers hire actual writers?). Then we get to chapter two (just beyond the demo) and realize we paid $15 to endure bad writing and have the voice of pixilated jesus in our ears whispering to us about the "soft heart" of the sea monster. This game has no sense of humor, no pathos and is essentially set up as a metaphor for salvation. The only saving grace (ha ha) is that everything the jesus-voice stand in says kind of sounds like it's referring to gay sex. (drink of my rushlight, boy-o.)\n\nThe old Sierra games were brilliant because of their sly sense of humor, their complex and original referentialness and the trickiness of the gameplay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mao_said_miau/recommended/338420/","mao_said_miau","humito68","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mao_said_miau/","510 products in account","Alum reminds me of my impressions of The Chronicles of Narnia. When a teenager, I was quite excited about the series until I read some critics. Then my reaction was like, "What?! This wonderful lion, Aslan, is no more than old boring Jesus? Oh no!" However, Alum's creators aren't as subtle as C. S. Lewis; their approach is more like that of Superbook.\n\nYou play as a member of religiously driven anarcho-primitivist gang of those who use terror as a way to convince people and would destroy the city's central heating system just to make people "think out of a box" and "understand things wider" (?!). The Rogations (that's their name, but it probably should be The Rogues) blame their contemporaries (modern people) that they live in industrialized society and can no longer be guided by "faith" as it were in the Middle Ages; if so, Middle Ages should be returned artificially. Does it remind you some, so to say, not very good people (from the real world)?!\n\nThey are not even Trotskyists, they are just ordinary fanatics. Let us believe that Kosmos is really "oppressive totalitarian state." But the Rogations themselves are no better. Just see how they demonize their political and ideological enemies, how they tend to idolize their leader, how they give reason for their activity using just theological "arguments." Actually, Alum is a rare case when my sympathies are entirely on the antagonist's side.\n\nOf course, the game is pretty linear and has only one possible ending. Actually, there are some other endings, but the player isn't encouraged to get them: there are no corresponding achievements, and they look more like another way to say "game over." I felt pity when I get a perfect ending to my tastes (the protagonist kills both the rebels' leader & the city governor and becomes himself the ruler of Kosmos), and they said just like, "Okay, now load and do it as we need you to do." You feel constantly driven by the hand (checkpoints, strong recommendations to save, various reminders etc.), and this affects even puzzles: I am no good at adventure games, but almost the entire game were walked through by me with no hints or guide. (But it could be a virtue of the game in terms of puzzles' consistency, I don't know.)\n\nAlso, the name of the studio is completely justified: it takes a great mumbo-jumbo to launch the game and especially to make it work via Steam.\n\nThat said, I can't help but note the positive side of the game: adorable graphics, pleasant soundtrack, satisfactory voice acting, complete length and pretty logical (mostly) puzzles. So, if you don't mind all of the said above, you are welcome to buy this game and enjoy it.","January 4","false","12.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

(Need to melt some ice? Fill a glass jar with water from a hot spring and then drive across a frozen tundra to where the ice you need to melt is located, somehow the water will still be warm!) There is an in-game hint system but it isn't very helpful. Action sequences are tedious, difficult and un-fun but thankfully if you mess them up enough times they're skippable.\n\nAnimations are very slow and a lot of walking animations and scene transitions (and some cutscenes but not all) are unskippable. There is a LOT of backtracking in this game, so you'll definitely notice it.\n\nVoice acting is horrendous, there is one side character who speaks with realistic emotion and she stands out. There is a black character among the rebels whose voice and language verges on caricature.\n\nAs other reviews have noted, there is INCREDIBLY unsubtle religious stuff going on in this game, like the Altruist tells another character at one point that he died for her, and all of the language around accepting the rushlight will sound very familiar if you know any evangelical christians. This may or may not be a dealbreaker. Additionally, Alum is trying to save his wife from "the Vague" - an illness that sounds kind of like depression, but his only evidence that she has it is that she fell out of love with him. I'm on chapter 6 and she has told him repeatedly to leave her alone and he's just super obsessed with her and it's a bit uncomfortable, though I'm sure in the end it'll be revealed that the devil corrupted her mind or something.\n\nAs mentioned, I have not completed the game, because I am on a puzzle in chapter 6 for which the hint is "distract Gwen" and I don't appear to have the means to do so.","June 29, 2015","false","7.5"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","0"

Basically, too slow moving for me; i did give it a descent attempt the first try, and vow to give it another chance but for now my opinion is 'meh'\n\nkeep in mind i am not a fan of games where i spend more time reading than playing .. and if skip skip skip dialog is slow on top of that, i just lose interest :D","October 11, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
