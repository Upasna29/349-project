I've accumulated a few tens of hours on it on the whatever it was platform that it used to be on. Ubisoftisomethingorother. Anyway, here's what you need to know about this game:\n\nIt CAN be a fun time waster. Run around with your army, pit them against things, cast some spells and make the people fall down and all that. The combat mechanics are unabashedly lifted from previous might and magic heroes games and I don't have a problem with that. That makes sense. That works more or less fine.\n\nIt's pretty much everything else that becomes or creates problems. Problems that they would prefer you throw real world money at to resolve. There are some very long wait timers for reinforcements in this game. On the order of days to replenish a completely decimated section of troops. Advanced troop options also cost special resources per troop, which you can only obtain a trickle of without shelling out the cash. To pervert a famous saying: all roads lead to your wallet.\n\nNow, I didn't just give up on the game immediately when I saw these problems, I went ahead and did what I could to get as far as I could stomach into the game. Which was near level 20. 17 I think? It's been a while since I gave up on this game. But if you want to maximize what you can do in it without shelling out the money, I would suggest playing a cleric. Get healing as soon as possible. Abuse healing. Healing spells in this game will resurrect dead troops. This is how I wound up with a sizable stockpile of basic troops, as I eventually reached a critical mass in my healing capabilities to keep from losing significant numbers of troops each day that I played. But this strategy does not work forever. As mentioned earlier, advanced troops cost special resources, and the only way to get those without handing over real world money is to do little daily quests that give you just a handful of, say, crystal each day. I'm not sure what the total amount might be at the end game, but where I was it was about 6 of this crystal attached to an annoying daily quest. 6 per day is not enough. Even with resurrections and very careful healing, you're going to lose more than 6 troops of any given kind in any given day. Further, at that slow rate, it's going to take you weeks to accumulate an entire troop of any given advanced soldier. I had a unit stack maximum of something like 120 or 135 or so. Trying to fill that on 6 per day seems like too much a fool's errand, too much an investment of time and efforts, to bother with for what payoff the game provides.\n\nThe chat is not particularly good either, and it seemed very cumbersome to try and group up with any strangers as you might do in any other multiplayer game out there. So cumbersome, in fact, that I don't think I was ever actually in any combats with a player run team mate.\n\nIf you want to play it, go in expecting it to try and get at your wallet and steel yourself against the obvious tactics employed to do so. It can be fun for fooling around in, but I wouldn't make the mistake of taking the game seriously or investing in it.\n\nEdit: To be perfectly clear- when I meant that it Can be a fun time waster, I meant for a few hours or so at best each day. And only if you already like the combat style of previous heroes of might and magic games. I've noticed in other reviews that people mention the awful build timers, and I will confirm that those take in the area of day(s) to resolve and they only get longer as you progress. Furthermore, they require basic resources like wood and gold. This wouldn't be much of a problem, but the only passive means of gaining either is a very drop in the bucket trickle. Which necessitates grinding for both, through combat, to build the buildings that you need to get the troop reinforcements that you need to do the combat that you need to get the resources that you need to build the buildings that you need to....you get the idea. At low level I could see it being a very vicious cycle if you didn't immediately pick up healing and abuse the hell out of it constantly.","November 29, 2015","false","0.6"," 69 of 76 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","69","76","5","0"

But i am not enjoying it the way i want to... I loved the old series, i have very fond childhood memories to the old series. This version is so dissapointing and frustrating. It is more a tablet or smartphone game than a PC game. PC gamers go on their pc's to play a videogame for a couple of hours, but you cant with this silly game. After about 10 minutes you're pretty much done again. Playing the waiting game... You're restricted in so many ways, new troops take hours and hours to regenerate unless you pay them money to hasten it. New resources take ages to regenerate unless you pay them money. More hero slots = more money. Money. Money. Money!\n\nI'd GLADLY pay 10-15 euro for this game if it was without the micro transactions and faster army regenerations etc. The way it is right now though is simply unplayable and certainly not worth spending ANY money on.\n\nNone of this is about enjoyment, its pay to win.\nI don't understand why this is even on Steam, this is something that you'd expect in the Play Store on your mobile device. Under the free apps section, where it belongs.","November 27, 2015","false","23.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

A lot of people that started to play could not get in because of couldn't load plugins and just gave up right there and wrote a bad review. Not really fair if you ask me, It would be like I would just give up on a game such as Diablo 3 on launch for error 37, that was a REAL problem but that was fixed. And so was this after the first day.\nWhen entering battle with a friend the game sometimes would get locked and you couldn't do anything because everything wasn’t loaded properly, to fix you had to restart the game, and when you got back you were still in the combat so you didn't have to restart or give up on your friend, this have been solved from what I have seen.\nThere were some clipping problem but it really wasn’t an issue at all\n\nMicro Transaction in the game pretty okay for the resources that you get, As of yet I haven't payed anything but i have gone through the shop looking at all the different things you can buy. You can get "SEALS" which is the pay currency from the main quest and different daily quests later in the game so you can still get them through that and if you log in everyday you will also get them from being an active player. If anything you can play this game for free no problem at all it just takes more time to play and some grinding.\nIf you compare it to any else game it's pretty much the same as Hearthstone, Magic the Gathering and league of legends. If you pay things, you will get the easier and faster. But people that don't have the time or money will say immediately "p2w" when you still can complete the game without paying anything.\n\nThe most generic negative review for the game. "Mobile game inside a web browser with micro transaction p2w" As of yet I haven't payed a dime, cent or Pennie for the game and it have been going pretty good.\nI haven't had any problem progressing in the game without paying for faster unit or anything, you just need to be patient in the game to get in to it. Just going down a lot of the negative reviews they are MOSTLY people that have played 0.5 or less saying "p2w wait forever" etc.\nAfter 25 hours I am level 13 and got 50 upgraded Sentinels and around 250 archers and 120 battle priests and is still going strong without paying anything, I have been grinding wood but nothing else really and will lose around 1-0 units per fight while farming. It's not hard at all.\n\n\nPlease comment if you want me to add something to the review like about the interface, gameplay etc.\nThis is my first real review that i have written for a game without joking around.","November 30, 2015","true","44.6"," 35 of 65 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","35","65","3","0"

Only start is hard when not having lot of troops but it time is on your side, you can always come back next day and fight again. Game currency is one of the most generous I`ve seen in mmorpg`s. If planning to invest you can get quite a lot with only 10 euros or so.\n\nI recommend this game because as it is, its one of the best browser mmorpg there is. However, there isnt any end game atm for old gamers and thats been problem really long. Devs not updating game almost at all and effort they put this game is really minimum if not even less.\n\nThere is PVP but its a joke.\n\nGive it a shot, you will be busy good 6months for sure before reaching end game and all tiers for weapons.\n\nSlow update is good thing for new players - you can catch up older ones.\n\n7/10 - would be higher if devs could give some love for this game.","December 15, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

As someone who played every game in the series over 15 years I very much enjoyed this game despite that I am not a fan of micro payments.\n\nMicrotrasactions are bad! Browser game on steam is bad ! - Every negative review . I do agree with those obvious points and if you do not want to play based on that it is your choice. However if you want to know opinion of someone who actually played this game all the way then you can read the rest .\n\nFirst of all it is a browser game . That means you need Flash Player,Enabled hardware Acceleration and working internet to play it . You could use steam to create account but I recommend going to offical website to avoid complications . http://clb.heroes-online.com/en-US/home . Steam and Browser accounts are not compitable so I would go with the website instead just because it has been up longer .\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes it is similar to other games but instead of playing agaist another city you will progress through text based narrative story over 4 chapters. Micropayments will be tied to hinger your progression like building timers,inventory space limits and rare resources .You will run out of army eventually and will be forced to wait for units to recharge . However you can avoid much of that by playing in coop which makes battles easier . Ask people for help and advice when in doubt if you can win a battle. I played this game over 150 hours and spend no money on boosts .\n\n\nPros:\n2 Player coop. Teamwork can lessen difficulty .\n4 Chapters+post game . Not counting timers and grinding , it is a 30-40 hours game .\nCombat is enjoyable .\nArtifact and skill system promotes different styles of play. Decent loot system with so many different artifacts that people don't even know all of them .\nMany challanging boss fights unlike regular MM games that had only armies vs armies .\n\nCons:\n\nMicrotranactions are all over the place. You don't have to use them if you play smart . It may take some time before you actually undestand how to do it .\nMany reused models from heroes 5,6 .\nSlow movement speed without boosts .\nPlayers who are not familiar with the series will have much harder time starting .\n\nI would give this game 6.5/10 If you gona play a game with mobile economy you might as well play one with lots of content and decent combat system .\n\nThis game has very poor steam review and its not justfied considering its one of the better microtransaction games because of content volume. If you can't make a proper negative review you only reviewing your lack of good opinion .\n\nNote : Feel free to contact me if you have questions or need help with battles . My character is maxed out so you won't actually loose a single unit . I don't have time to beat entire game for you but if you stack on a boss and have no units let me know .","November 25, 2015","true","0.8"," 19 of 43 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","19","43","2","3"

When you have to spend real money to keep up in the game, you have effectively made it a "Pay to win" game.

Its OK, but its a bit too hard to keep troops alive in the beginning.

Worked perfectly, for nostalgia hits, I try it from time to time.\n\nThis particular version ... I get a white screen while trying to play. Checking the local content reveals a bad file, downloading it, gives a 0 byte sized file that does nothing. Downloading the whole game again also changes nothing. Not bothering with support, it just directed me to player forums and the above was their solution.\n\nFor anyone interested. It's an OK game, the battlefield fights are nice, but unless you pay, you'll waste a lot of time each day before starting collecting troops from various castles (not a problem early on, really really bothersome later).\nAnd PvP ... don't bother unless you're willing to pay a lot.
