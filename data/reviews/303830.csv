Although I'm not entirely sure how KTM would feel about their roaring twin sounding like a dodgy arcade version of a 4 cylinder 600cc screamer. Speaking of which, the noise from the bikes will drive you batshit crazy within 20 mins and a lack of ingame music doesn't help, recommend turning sound down and draining it out with your favourite tunes.\nIf you enjoy games that don't try to hold your hand then this is the game for you! not only will it not hold your hand, it won't even tell you what the hell you should be doing. 1.5h in and the only thing that seems to be unlocked are the first 3 races in the Beginners tournament that I have already done 3 times each.\nThe ability to change what bike you're riding during the race not only negates the need for the stupid rough area's that restrict the sports bikes to about 85kph and allows the cruisers to excel, but it removes what little immersion the game barely offered in the first place and just feels a little silly.\nI was hoping to get a slightly more arcade handling version of Tourist trophy, what I got was a cheesy arcade racer from the 90's, even if it has been wrapped into a fairly pretty exterior.\nThe cost is inexplicably excessive, and I will definitely be pursuing a refund.\nIf you see this on a steam sale for $2.99 then sure, give it a go, why not, you won't get 2 hours of average entertainment for that much anywhere else.\n\n3/10\n","December 3, 2014","false","1.6"," 75 of 85 people (88%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","88","75","85","11","0"

One of the first things you notice is that a lot of the races are on unlit tracks and your bikes have no lights. Presumably to hide graphics that are only a pinch above 16bit. Never mind, what about the sound? Hm, is my soundcard broken? Is it really meant to sound like this?! Jeez, that's depressing. So let's forget the aesthetics, how do the bikes handle? Oh. They don't. I know it's an arcade game but this isn't even up to standards set by Super Hang-0n in 1987.\n\nSummary: Complete shovelware. Not even worth the two bucks I paid for it.","May 3","false","4.1"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","25","27","4","1"

With that said, I would be embarrassed if I paid over $10. I did check metacritic, which said it wasn't great and can't disagree.\n\n+Graphics\n+Runs well on average pc's\n+/-Arcade not sim (if that is desired)\n-Way over-priced at $40\n-Seems more like a novice indie game than a PS4 release!\n-Mediocre controls and bland gameplay\n\nIts a bit bland and controls are not the best. Its arcade style and is fairly low quality except for decent graphics.  and runs well on decent pc's. I woulds say steer clear unless if you get a big sale, even then may not even be worth your time with so many good games these days.\n\nI'm sure they worked hard on the game, but am surprised this was $40 and ps4, when its ps2 quality imo. With some more work, it could be passable for a indie game for $15. Sorry, I can't recommend it unless its on a big sale. Its okay at best, but if you have a PC that can handle Ride or MotoGP15 those are much better, but mostly sim where this is a rare arcade motocycle game. So if you want a arcade motorcycle game, you may want to get this on sale 5/10.","February 20","false","0.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

NO. This is HORRIBLE. Just NO. Don't let the pretty pictures fool you. I paid $2 for this and I feel ripped off. It's *that* bad.\n\nLet's create the Motorcycle Club experience in your mind. Ready? Here goes.. First, think of the worst racing game you've ever played. Now imagine it gets worse than that. There's a corner coming up.. and you're turning the thing you're supposed to be controlling but it just doesn't feel like it has any physics. It's OK though because the collisions just bounce you off the wall and you can keep going. The only problem is.. you begin to feel the dread that the game will crash at any minute. Then it does. The game crashes! You're back at your desktop. Safe again. Now, let's go back into Steam. Right click on 'Motorcycle Club' in your Library. Select the 'Delete Local Content' option from the menu and your time with Motorcycle Club comes to an end. Now you've experienced the full experience of Motorcycle Club, you don't have to buy it and you can go find something worthwhile to spend your money on instead. You're welcome.\n\nThis game should have been motorcycle clubbed to death.","May 2","false","0.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

The only disapointment was the game is not optimised for the PC. My alienware latop has 8Gig Ram and i7 intel and a nividia graphic card and it barely runs on min specs.....But l play Ryse that is just has good on my PC than it is on the Xbox One!!!!! So l am very disapointed l can't enjoy this game. Please optimise for the PC not just for the PS4 that this game is also on. Most of my PC games that are new like FarCry 3 and 4 and Dark Souls 2 runs sooooooo good on the PC and Skyrim is amazing!!!! and they are open world!!! why can't this game run when its a simple arcade racer? Anyway if you are a bike fan this just cool to look at the bikes and is simple fun. If you are not a bike fan, ride the bikes in Watch dogs or GTA it would be way more fun than this game.","January 4, 2015","false","0.1"," 26 of 57 people (46%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","46","26","57","4","1"
