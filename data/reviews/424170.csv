Well, I'm not sure what the best words to describe it are. This is an action-adventure game, reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda and its many clones. You're the young man destined to save the land from evil, and so on and so forth. This makes for a story that's deeply rooted in tradition. But hey, tradition is good. As for the game itself... eh... I guess I would describe it as "in-offensive" and "oddly compelling". That doesn't exactly sound like a thrilling or even confident description for this game, but it's the best that I can muster.\n\nAs expected of an action-adventure, you'll wander the world and seek enormously-powerful objects, while fighting monsters and solving puzzles. How The fall of gods goes about this is pretty interesting. The world of Ergia isn't massive, but it is very dense. There are a lot of houses and caves to explore, each serving some sort of purpose. As you progress, the tools you obtain will open up previously unavailable areas, which lead to optional yet welcome rewards. This satisfying game-play loop is bolstered by a thoroughly pleasant soundtrack.\n\nThe dangers you'll face are almost entirely ineffective. As you explore, you'll earn experience, which can be used to improve your stats. Even early on, you'll find yourself grossly overpowered, and monsters never pose a threat. Keeping your HP and MP up is simple, due to the large number of restoration items, you'll recieve from fresh monster corpses. Most of the bosses are dealt with by figuring out their weakness. It's an extension of the puzzle-solving you employ to get through the dungeons, and it works well enough. Altogether, the combat mechanics are really poor, but you learn to ignore them after awhile.\n\nThe fall of gods has a ton of spells, too many in my opinion. Most of these spells are only used a few times over the course of the entire game. There are even a couple that are so useless; you were probably better off never finding them in the first place. The same could be said for the weapons and items. Your inventory will become bloated with quite a bit of junk. The density of this game works against itself, especially towards the end. When you find a spell and it only serves its purpose in one or two instances, then it might as well have been a key with fancy special effects.\n\nThe likelihood you'll persevere is exactly why I use words like "oddly-compelling" and "in-offensive" to describe this game. Its combat isn't particularly great, and the constant barrage of collectibles erodes its charming qualities. Still, I found myself entranced by this adventure. The lack of difficulty works in the game's favor, since I could put it down and revisit it whenever I had a few minutes to spare. Sometimes good game design is knowing your limitations. I know I would have dropped this game much earlier; if monsters were capable of killing the hero in a few hits, falling in a hole resulted in instant death, or that progress couldn't be saved at almost any time.\n\nDo I recommend The fall of gods? Honestly, I wish that there was something in-between the thumbs-up and the thumbs-down. I stuck with this game to see it to the end, and I didn't hate it, but is that really enough for a recommendation? On the other hand, while the game suffers from a number of issues, the adventure elements are pretty solid. Rather than torment myself further, I'm going to break it down. if you're looking for a game that is as good as Zelda, let alone better, then this isn't it, not by a long-shot. If your expectations are low, and you don't mind dealing with some jank, then you could be in for a pleasant surprise.\n\nNo guarantees though.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","May 3","true","10.5"," 30 of 30 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","30","30","0","1"

The action is also very similar: swing your sword to kill the foes, cut bushes, break jars, collect hearts and coins. The new thing is the skills: sort of spells you can assign to the trigger buttons, the mana points you use slowly replenish.\n\nThe good:\nThe store page says that it's not a full support for the controller, but it's because it doesn't work in the main menu. During the game the controls are perfect.\nYou can save anytime, and in 4 slots.\nA lot of places where you can heal in the beginning: the game doesn't try to murder you as soon as you press 'New game'.\nThe map system is awesome and very well thought. The caves that you've already looted are marked as 'Done'. Plus it's basically the real screens zoomed out so it's not a theorical map leading you 'somewhere on the North East, behind the big rock'.\nWhen you pass behind a tree or something, your character have an outline. Very handy.\nDay and night cycle, yup I kid you not.\n\n\nThe bad:\nThe foes seem to have telepathic powers and constantly agroo you, even through the walls.\nThe sound options are very bare: no way to change the volume of music, it's either on or off.\nSome actions could have had a bit more animations and sounds, like casting a spell or breaking a jar.\nThe graphics look a bit blurred, because of the zoom I guess. It does get a bit tiring to the eyes.\n\nThe game hooked me up from the beginning, I went exploring the map, finding some small hidden caves - which got marked as done - so nifty! The night fell and some ghosts appeared, and they weren't OP! Then had my first dungeon, under the water where you have to take a breath at some oxygen chimneys and you go around solving small puzzles and killing enraged mermaids; how cool is that?\n\nI totally recommend this game, fun with a lot of original details. Definetly a keeper in my huge library!","January 28","true","5.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","19","21","2","0"

Even though I often tend to stay away from RPGMaker games, I bought this one precisely because it chooses another approach than so many other of its kind. Instead of boring me to death with the gazillionth implementation of your typical run of the mill JRPG it chooses to utilize a combat system that brings the player back to the times where "Secret of Mana", "Terranigma" and "Illusion of Time" created some of your fondest gaming memories.\nSure, it does have its quirks (the on occasions rather strange grammar for example), and the bossfights (as far as I played so far) are rather simple (choose the right weapon/magic and smash/shoot/blast it to smithereens), but all in all I feel pleasantly reminded of the games I mentioned above.\n\nIn a nutshell: I can recommend this game to everyone who liked classics like "Secret of Mana", "Terranigma" and "Illusion of Time" and who needs a well earned break from all the typical JRPG like games out there in favor of a refreshing (albeit in no way new) combat system, where you beat your enemies yourself instead of waiting for your character to do it for you.","December 21, 2015","true","20.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

The story is really good and unexpected. As I was advancing though the game it became more difficult as well, but that wasn't a problem due to my new items and powerful spells which I acquired by playing the game and exploring different places. In addition to it, the game's soundtrack is quite charming and does it's best to create an adventurous "Middle age" atmosphere.\n","December 22, 2015","true","2.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

At the time, I wanted to try a game that reminded me of some of the older games i have tried. This game fit the jondre exactly, and is exactly what i wanted. Due to indie games no longer being  uploaded to xbox360, that version will never get a upgrade, so it is lucky that i can get the game again on here. If you played the xbox360 version, i definetly would get again from here. This version is updated and continues the story from the xbox360 version. Although you will need to replay it from the beginning, this version has everything the original xbox360 version has, including secret caves, mini bosses, secret items, and multiple area's. This was one of the 1st indie games i ever downloaded on xbox360, and am happy to support the developer. If you want an action rpg, with ode's to older games  found on snes (i won't name games!), then this is the game you want to get your hands on! If a newcomer and you never played the xbox360 version, let me tell you, this one is quite fun. I hope you enjoy it as much as i do!

Great controller support. I'll have to get used to the 2 decades old system of holding down a key to invoke strafing but since this isn't a 100% shooter/ranged combat, it shouldn't be too hard. I didn't come here for story, so no comment there (and I've hardly played). But if you're looking for a real time action combat system, this is one of those games. It still has tile based movement (I wish the movement was smoother, though. It kinda locks to either horizontal or vertical). It also works well with xbox 360 controller - the controls are mapped out nicely. This game looks it'll be worth it's pricetag, and definitely worth it on sale especially if the real time combat with this art style is what you're looking for.","March 31","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What do I mean by extra stuff? Well back in the good ole days(yes I'm old) you had some games like this, but if you really really remember they were pretty basic. This game has a boat load of spells(skills) to use, weapons, armor, items. It also has little side things you can do..mostly fetch quests but its nice to have little side things... Overall its not a long game or difficult skill wise because you get experience from killing mobs and also for doing quests and sometimes finding experience in a box. You can then use those experience to up your skills to your liking. I hardly used the spells myself and was all melee putting most into str so I was a wee bit too powerful and the game was on the easy side. Now there are some parts that are not easy but those are where you have to figure out what to do(what skill, item, weapon to use) or where to go but maybe that was just me.
