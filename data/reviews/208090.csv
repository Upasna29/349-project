Games like Unreal Tournament and Quake gradually faded to give place to the more "realistic" and military-like games like Call of Duty and Battlefield.\nYep, that sucks.\n\nBut Loadout came to save the day.\n\nLoadout brings back the glory days of arena shooters with it's fast-paced action, high focus on mobility and gore, gore, GOREEEEE.\nBut that's not all it has. It has something that is extremely important for me: sense of humor. And quite a weird one (in a good way).\nThis isn't your usual "gritty colorless srs bsns" shooter. No. This is a colorful game where you can be a guy wearing Billie Joe Armstrong's trademark black shirt and red tie, but forgot to wear pants, jiggling your junk around instead.\n\nBut after all this, I didn't even mention the best part, and the one thing that makes Loadout really unique: Weaponcrafting.\nYeah.\nForget the days where games gave you a limited amount of guns to play with. Here you make your dream gun as you wish.\nThink of Borderlands gun system, except it isn't random, you have full control over it.\nMake a fire minigun or an electric launcher of death, whatever you want, kill your opponents in an unique way every time.\n\nAlso, this game is P2W, but in this case meaning "Pay 2 Wang". Nothing that directly affects gameplay can be bought with money. You have to play to become stronger. But you can throw some cash at EoR to look totally FABULOUS while doing it.","November 26, 2013","true","554.7"," 3,732 of 4,243 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","732","4","0","102"

The reason for this is simple - the devs have given up on the PC version of this game in favor of the cash-grab that is the PS4 version. Forgetting their roots, the Loadout team has cut ties with the PC world in a real way - they've outright admitted that they are not planning on supporting the PC version of this game any longer. This means that all the problems which are present - unbalanced weapon builds, buggy game types (jackhammer, I'm looking at you), tiny map variety, and unfinished game dynamics - are never going to be improved upon.\n\nAfter a lot of thought, I played my last Loadout match today.

Usually in under a minute you're on the battlefield (EU servers) and you can find matches even at 6 in the morning\n\n-you build your weapons yourself from a large collection of gun parts, so you can create weapons that fit your game style (e.g. one-shot sniper weapons with slow fire rate, or a gatling gun that rapidly sets your enemies on fire, or a rocket launcher whose rockets "crawl" along the ground, or a mine thrower to set up traps for the enemy...)\n\n-funny over-the top violent graphics (especially the death animations), and pretty explicit taunts (fat women with half of their face off taunting your by twerking, naked guys who dangle their genitals, or a Rocky Balboa guy doing a pole dance, etc etc)\n\n-you earn XP and in-game currency while playing, so you can unlock and buy more gun parts (e.g. healing ammo, bigger magazines, remote-controlled rockets) and equipment items (such as turrets, hand grenades, spawn points, deployable health packs) the longer you play. Mostly play-to-win (but only mostly, see below).\n\n-It is just  a hell lot of fun to play!\n\n\nThe bad:\n\n-if you've been playing 1st person shooters, then you will painfully notice that 3rd person shooters just offer a LOT less precision than 1st person shooters (because your 3rd person character can't stop moving in the middle of a step - so you can only move in "step" units across the map. In a game where precise movement is key, this is a big disadvantage (even though the devs do their best to hide this problem).\n\n-if you've played serious arena shooters, you will at certain moments be annoyed by the graphics, because an overkill of on-screen effect overlays often times makes careful aiming impossible. If one enemy uses fire ammo, and another player shoots a healing rocket in the same area, you will just have red fire, blue tesla balls and green health goo all over your screen and won't be able to see the actual terrain, or the players you are trying to kill.\n\n-some completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ designer thought that it would be a good idea that players have to press the shift key to run (instead of having run be the default and pressing shift to walk slow and sneaky). This has the effect that the ENTIRE time you play the game, you have to hold down shift!!! (because you want to the running around *all* the time, with some very few exceptions in "capture the hammer" mode).\n\n-Most items sold for money in the store are only cosmetic, plus you can buy a booster pack that increases the rate at which your earn XP and in-game currency. BUT there are some important exceptions: Your character can carry TWO GUNS AND ONE EQUIPMENT ITEM (jump boots/hand grenades/turret/...). Such a combination is called a "Loadout". Every time you respawn after dying, you can choose which loadout you want to use. After playing a while, you will have quite a number of different guns and equipment items - but free players can have only a limited number of guns, and more importantly ONLY 3 LOADOUTS (ie gun+equipment combinations). So if you do not buy additional loadout slots for real money, you are at a bit of a disadvantage, since you can't use the right gun and item combinations. For instance, if your enemy has a really good sniper and has secured the base with turrets, you will need yourself a good sniper weapon to have a chance to get close, plus maybe the disguise equipment item (so turrets won't recognize you as an enemy, allowing you to just run past unharmed). If you are a paid player, you will have the right combination (sniper, plus close-range weapon, plus disguise) in one of your loadouts. If you are a free player with only three possible combinations, chances are you won't... Having said that, skill, strategy and good teamplay (especially a good healer) are definitely more important factors for whether your team will win.","October 28, 2014","true","266.7"," 213 of 268 people (79%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","79","213","268","19","30"

This was when the game was good. All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there was no problems with imbalance; Everyone could kill everyone at any time. Also, the game used to give you UNLIMITED GUN SLOTS and five loadouts. You would think that for a game with "Bajillions of guns", they would at least give you more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you have to pay to get more. At one point, I had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning on new ideas for more, because personally, that's where I found it fun. When finishing a match, you were either awarded with an XP boost, extra spacebux, or a gun part. It was a beautiful system which in my opinion should have never been changed.\n\nToday's Loadout is rife with awful development choices, like the horribly sluggish tech tree and the addition of another in-game currency known as "Blutes". In all honesty, the game would have been better, had they just kept it paid past early development.\n\nAlso, if you're a new player, you may as well forget about it, because though they offer blute rewards for bot matches, they're reduced, making it very difficult for you to compete against anybody who has better guns and higher ranked weapons parts than you.\n\nIn summary; What used to be an amazing game has been flipped upside down and ruined by "fixing" game systems that were never broken in the first place.

I just want to clear things up here.\nYes, I have over 400 hours invested in this game.\nYes, this game is enjoyable with friends.\nYes, I'm pretty active on the Loadout forums.\n\nBut the thing is, the only thing that is keeping me somewhat associated with Loadout is the community and art, everything else is boring and unorganised.\n\nLet's start with the main part of the game, the weaponcrafting.\nWeaponcrafting is an interesting concept. It gives you HEAPS of customization options for your weapons and that's a good thing... right? Wrong. Half of these weapon parts are either useless or just worse than their counterparts. The other half is used by 90% of the entire playerbase. What's the point of being creative in this game when you just get killed by two hit rockets that are being held by someone who might as well be eating popcorn while he watches the fireworks. Once you get used to the "SUPER WACKY CUSTOMIZATION!" the game becomes bland and boring because you're constantly seeing the same thing over and over again. Shield users, Launchers, Snipers, Boot users, Liquid cooling beam snipers. You catch my drift.\n\nLet's bring up the artstyle. Personally, that's the best thing Loadout has going for it. The graphics, models and art. There are heaps of cosmetics for each of the three characters that can be bought with real money (who'd of thunk it?!) A majority of these cosmetics are pretty good looking, however, there are a few that don't look good at all (Doo rags), some that are disappointing (Vega's twist) and some that are just way too pricey (Axls Rod.) $40 for no pants?! No thank you. Level design is pretty good, with some pretty good jumps around the map that can be used to flank enemies.\n\nFinally, the community. This is a mixed bag. 1/3 of the community is good, 1/3 are abusing exploits/Op weapons and the last third are trolls/hackers. I usually only communicate with the good side of Loadout, however, a lot of Loadouts player will tick you off with their cheap combos and "tactics". These combos and tactics are advertised a LOT in the Loadout community, to "help" new players with what they lack. This creates a cycle of people who circlejerk each other with their shields, boots and OP weapon combos. Does EoR fix these things? Rarely. Weapons have been nerfed before, but they either become useless (Pulse before release) or they don't actually fix it and you have to wait another 3 years for a patch (Liquid cooling sniper beam.) Not to mention that various streamers use these tactics, and therefore, enforce these cheap combinations (Gst, botno and Beefy. I'm looking at you guys.) Not all of the streamers do this, but the majority of them do, which not only enforces bad habits but also makes their streams boring to watch, since all they're doing is stomping all over new players, using the excuse that they're "Just testing them."\n\nAll in all, right now, Loadout is not worth your time if you want to have a good arena shooter experience. I will continue to play Loadout, but only because I will be constantly giving feedback to the developers, to prevent this game from going full speed ahead on the stupid train. If you want to help this game, I suggest you do the same.","February 4, 2014","false","496.5"," 714 of 987 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","714","987","0","42"

I only spent a few hours on steam, but I've spent more than 50 hours on the ps4 version. I decided to jump back into the PC version and now I have a verdict on this version.\n\nLoadout is a very unique F2P shooter. You have the ability to create different combinations of weapons and use them to blow up or dismember your opponents. You have a lot of options and every combination is fun to create and fun to use in  combat.\n\nThe game also had a very smart approach to Free to play. The game allowed you to use the money for gun parts which didn't make the gun over powered.\n\nThe player base is currently still alive and kicking and you can jump into any game mode without any trouble.\n\nAll the game modes are incredibly fun, so if you get sick of one game mode you can quickly jump into another without a problem.\n\nYou might be asking yourself, why I'm giving this game a negative review then if all the things that I listed make the game seem awesome. Well the reality is the PC version is terrible compared to the PS4 version.\n\nThe game has been abandoned by the developers, who announced that the servers will shutdown and not to mention no updates for a while now.\n\nSome connection issues also ruin the fun of the game, but that rarely happens so I doubt you will run into that problem.\n\nIn the end this game is incredibly fun, but the devs abandoned the game, so there is next to no reason to play the PC version. If you have a PS4 that is the place to play the superior version of the game.\n\nFinal Rating:\n4/10 - Don't bother with the PC version\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you dislike post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","December 8, 2015","false","1.5"," 123 of 149 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","123","149","2","7"

You may still play it but don't spend any cash on it.\n\nI bought Steam Launch Starter Pack in June 2014. I played the game a bit and I loved it but I removed it shortly after that. So a few days ago I decided to give it a try again. I bought Blutes and XP boosts and I tried to play the game again. I thought people still play Loadout. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nTurns out the game was almost completely abandoned. It used to have about 30 000 people playing it at the same time, now this number is closer to 500. I have a feeling most of them randomly found Loadout on Steam Store, saw it's free and decided to play it a bit. Casual matchmaking is still possible — just select European or American servers depending on time of a day.\n\nMoreover the game was abandoned by its developers. It used to get updates almost every week. Now they won't even add PvE mode (PS4 received it almost right after launch in January 2015). After PS4 launch Loadout's creative director left the development team. Shortly after that 12 people working on Loadout were fired and the game does not receive any more content.\n\nSo don't do the same mistake as I did: do not invest money in this game, it's dead. Feel free to try it. It's sad actually, the game itself is pretty decent. I have a feeling Edge of Reality is going to keep servers running until they can cover expenses. They already shut down Australian servers.","May 9, 2015","false","34.2"," 119 of 147 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","119","147","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Voltlight/recommended/208090/","Voltlight","Voltlight-A-Salomon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Voltlight/","236 products in account","All of my experience on this game is with at least one other person I know, I note this to ensure a review that's fair by playing the game the way I imagine it was meant to be experienced.\n\nTo cut it short for those who don't want to read; the game is mainly ruined by its community. I waited all these hours before making this review just to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nI originally started playing this game due to wanting a game other than Counter-strike to play with my colleagues at work. This turned out to be a very good choice due to how well it runs on my work computer. It is an i3 with Intel HD4000, quite low specs compared to the majority of PCs today.\n\nI'll start with praising how well optimized this game appears to be; I get about 45 fps solid on lowest settings, and it looks great. I have experienced it on my home computer, and the graphics are of course, even more impressive; but that's not where I choose to play this game.\n\nThe game has a cool concept; build your own gun and fight in teams in various game modes. When you first play it, you'll get a very TF2-style vibe from it. It's fast paced and cartoony.\n\nThe first problem arises in the perspective of third person. This isn't a heavy criticism, because the developers are trying something a bit different here; setting third person in a fast paced environment. In games like this, I like to be able to look around a lot, checking my back, and it gets a bit annoying with the camera behind you. This is just my personal criticism, so I'm sure some people like it this way.\n\nThere is something incredibly off-feeling about the aiming in the game, someone I know also noted this. I'm experienced in playing shooters, and I cannot at all get the hang of this, after 70 hours. There is some weird depth-perception issue for me, where I will often shoot the ground in front of myself, instead of an enemy further back. I can't put my finger on this, but I'm going to note it in the review (and yes, I have increased the FOV).\n\nNext, the servers and client issues. There is a lot of client-side control in this game, it seems. You will often die, but still manage to kill someone after it's stated you are dead; simply due to lag. You might not see yourself die for a few seconds, giving you chance to shoot at people before it updates. With the gamemode 'Jackhammer', the hammer carriers will very often kill each other at the same time. Some might say it adds more fun into the game, but I find it mildly fustrating and in general it just looks buggy.\n\nNow, the main gripe. The community. To put it simply, the community is not what you expect. It's not friendly like TF2, nor is it as awful as counter-strike. It's worse. You will get a lot of arguing in the chat between players, and constantly spammed with 'ez', regardless of the state of the game. But that's not really it.\n\nIt's the amount of cheaters that infest this game. The game developers, as far as I can tell, haven't put a lot of effort into countering cheaters. There is a report function, but I have no idea if that actually works, of course. Some cheaters are more obvious that others, but due to the way the community is, you'll often bump into these people the next day, and the next day, and so fourth, as I've experienced. Now, these players do get banned, eventually; but the fact it goes on for so long is pretty terrible.\n\nOne factor I've also noticed regarding gameplay is the unbalance of the weapons. I say unbalance, because I have been unsuccessful in reaching the damage other players have with very similar guns. I've had people with standard-looking pulse guns that kill you in three hits, without reduction in firing speed. Now, this could be part of the cheating fiasco, simply aimbots shooting the head for extra damage, but it's not really possible to tell.\n\nI hesitated for a long time for atleast 30 hours of gameplay, deciding on whether to recommend this game or not. It's a cool game, but in the end, the community just makes it not worth it. I also don't really like the boasting-emotes the developers put out there, just adds to the doucheyness experienced.","May 25, 2015","false","98.9"," 101 of 136 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","101","136","4","0"

The gameplay encourages both high amounts of verticality and versitility. If games like Doom, Quake, or Unreal Tournament strike your fancy, then this is for you. The real cream of the game rests in the weapon crafting system, where you can craft virtually any weapon that suits your playstyle.\n\nThe badThe game doesn't seem like it's being updated very frequently. I first staretd playing Loadout about a year ago. The amount of content that's been released during that time has been lacking to say the least. No new weapons have been added from the default Ball, Rifle, Laser, and Rocket types. Very very few attachments have been added. There are a couple new levels, and a couple reskinned levels that have been added. No new characters, and very very little has been added to the cosmetic shop. The population of the game is arguably dwindling. It's not uncommon to be paired off against the same player time and time again throughout the course of a few hours of gaming.\n\nThe cost of cash shop items are atrocious and is not very wallet friendly. Currently, 600 spacebux costs $1, and 16000 costs $20. It costs 2000 spacebux to buy 1 gunslot, and 6000 spacebux for 1 loadout. The amount of gunslots you get as a player isn't half bad, since they give you 9 slots for free, which you have to unlock by leveling up. However, they only give you 3 free loadouts, and each loadout allows you to use only 2 weapons at a time. Vanity items to customize your character typically costs between 2000 spacebux to 8000 spacebux for a singular item, such as shirts, pants, accessories, hats, masks, etc.\n\nThe uglyGiven the steep prices of the cash shop, the lack of content updates, and the dwindling population, I cannot in good faith recommend this game. I honestly feel that if the game were updated more frequely, or the cash shop prices were to come down, that Loadout would have a fighting chance. But, personally, this game does little to encourage me to keep coming back to it. Loadout is great for a short term fix, or when you aren't in the mood to play any of your usual games. But simply put, there are other games that I would much rather commit to, both short term and long term.","January 11, 2015","false","29.0"," 91 of 121 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","91","121","6","0"

This is ridiculous.\n\nEven though I did not accept the privacy policy after reading it (I usually don't even look at the privacy policy, my friend warned me), I was still getting e-mails! They send enough e-mails about the new updates, changes etc. to make your whole inbox get filled with spam.\n\nNow, about the actual game:\n\nCUSTOMIZING WEAPONS - this option looks very cool, but does not work good.

The first, and original, hasnt been touched by the devs in ages. They left it behind. Personaly, this version was better. Upgrades were ease to get a grasp of, combat wasnt confusing, pvp was enjoyable. All they had to do was add a campaign mode and it woulda been perfect.\n\nInstead....\n\nVersion two. The PvE story we wanted was put in here instead. All your work you had done on your main account, was now lost and you had to start from scratch. No money refunded, no in game items, nothing. Upgrades where changed into these weird card things that you can fuse other bits into to make them better. But that ment finding strongboxes filled with good loot that you have to PAY to get open. Yea, real cash. No more earning it for free. Pay to win!\n\nAfter that virtual slap to the face, you now have to deal with the insane difficulty jump in the campain. COmbat became confusing with how difficult it became. You where now expected to have this amazing gear... that you need to pay to get from the loot safes. As a direct result, only the payers get great items, thus making their pvp game that much better.\n\nAfter asking about a transfer of all the things I earned and bought (Way to much money, im ashamed to admit) I was blatently told, "No, your fault for wasting money in that version of the product". Most of this was cosmetic, and has no effect on your damage or playability, so why couldnt that be transfered? They could have even transfered my weapons, albit at a much reduced power and thus needing fusion, and id be happier. All the skill trees I invested HOURS into, where now reset. Nothing stings more then loss of progression.\n\nFor a new player, this is no big deal. You can play and get the free loot crates, bombs for a couple boxes, and go from there. But eventually you will hit the pay wall. For vets... I uninstalled the second version and will never go back.\n\nFor anyone looking for a nice shooter with absolute crazyness and tons of fun, i reccomend the original version. You can get it all for free! You dont need to spend money to get peices to fuse into gear to make it good, you can just use the skill trees via free money progression.\n\nDo I reccomend this game? No. I dont. I did once.\nI reccomend the first.","October 12, 2015","false","157.1"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","2"

The mechanics are awesome, the act of simply running and jumping with your character feels great then comes the games niche: the weaponcrafting. While there are many combinations not all of them are viable, however there are enough to cater to all styles of play. There are a wide variety of defensive weapons, aggressive weapons, long range weapons, close range weapons; whatever you find fun you can focus your weapons and loadouts around.\n\nThe devs work closely with the community and I highly recommend becoming part of the closed beta, there is room for competitive play in the future and hopefully a great amount of success. If you're bored of the current military based fps' then it's definitely worth checking out the game.\n\nHere is a link to my Loadout montage playlist, check out the videos and decide for yourself if the game looks worth the time/money investment:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL53l70ESgmaFnt-P8kNbsAcZX_ItWRqRm&feature=mh_lolz","June 29, 2013","true","870.0"," 43 of 63 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","43","63","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evostorm/recommended/208090/","evostorm","EvoStorm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evostorm/","808 products in account","This game is absolute madness. The setting is unoriginal and generic, the characters cartoonish and ugly, and the gameplay over-the-top and messed up beyond belief. Combine that all together, and you get a love you either can't stand, or love beyond belief. And I went with the latter.\n\nLoadout is fun. That's all it really is, fun. There's no stress you might get from other FPS/TPS games like CoD or Borderlands, mostly because of the fact you can't take this game seriously. The creators did everything they can to deliver a game that'll make you lose or die with a smile on your face, without feeling the frustration from similar games. Of course, this doesn't apply to everyone, but you get the general point here.\n\nThe weapon customization is awesome. Instead of choosing stock guns from different categories, you can design it in any way you want, from snipers to mini-guns to healing rocket launchers and whatnot. Even though some combinations might be considered "OP", it's all about the way you use it, or the way you dodge it. I have to agree the balance tends to tilt a teeny bit from time to time, but you can find that in a lot of similar games. The main point is, you can be as creative as you want with them,\n\nThe game modes currently available are Blitz (Control Points), Jackhammer (Capture the Flag), Death Snatch (Kill Confirmed), Extraction and Annihilation. The first three are what they are: Blitz is a simple "capture the control point" mode, where you need to stand on a point long enough to capture it, and 6 captures will decide the game. Jackhammer is basically Capture the Flag with a hammer instead of the flag that allows you to smack your enemies in one shot. Death Snatch is that CoD game mode with Blutonium (ore) instead of dog tags, and the most fun if you just like killing people. Extraction involves collecting the beforementioned ore enough times to win, and Annihilation is pretty much a combination of the first 3 mentioned game modes, also known as the "Competitive" mode.\n\nOf course, the game isn't perfect. The outfits are awfully expensive (but look epic), the server still bugs out from time to time, and the party system might still throw your friends into the enemy team, even if there's enough space in the lobby. But then again, the game's still fresh, so they're expected issues.\n\nIn overall, this is currently one of the best F2P shooters out there. It's easy to pick up and play, a lot of fun to play with friends, and just insane in overall. If you're more of a serious gamer, it's best to stay away from this (although giving it a try won't hurt). If you're a casual(ish) gamer, give it a shot. And if you're a flying grapefruit like me, you'll absolutely love this game. Even if it's just to see yourself walking around with a giant hole in your body, or with just a brain and eyes, Loadout is fun for every game who likes to have a laugh every now and then while shooting off someone's head or arm. It's mindless fun with rather mindless characters.","February 12, 2014","true","40.2"," 42 of 62 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","42","62","0","4"

Situations like the one this game has found itself in are the reason people despise consoles, though their anger is usually misdirected onto the people who play console games instead of the developers like Edge of Reality who abandon their core players (the PC gamers who made them successful to begin with) for the relatively easy profit of console development.\n\nPS4 version is leaps and bounds ahead of the PC one at this point. No updates, no communication, nothing that I've encountered, at any rate. Admittedly I've not been following the game too closely, merely casually observing, so perhaps things aren't quite as bleak as they seem. I have a feeling they are though.\n\nIf you absolutely must check this game out, play the PS4 version. Even then, I'd not give Edge of Reality any of my hard-earned money. I don't support companies who screw over one player base for another. They'd do well to look at companies like Digital Extremes (Warframe) and CDProjekt (Witcher 1-3) to learn how to support a game on multiple platforms.\n\nNot recommended, even for free.","May 19, 2015","false","1.4"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","23","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegallows/recommended/208090/","thegallows","Gallows","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegallows/","1289 products in account","Loadout is a third person shooter that differs from other third person shooters I have tried. It is gory, fast, action packed, and has a large range of customization. Loadout can be found on Steam and takes a player’s Steam ID to add friends to the in-game friends list. My first impressions were that it was going to be a typical shooter. Nothing unique or worth mentioning about it, just some brief hype, however it turned out to be much better than that. At the home screen, a player can also see when there is happy hour and any changes that they make to their character will also be shown on the home screen, which includes weapons and outfits like this angry man you see here…\n\nGraphics & Gameplay\nThe graphics work very well with the gameplay. The gameplay often involves trying to capture points and/or demolishing opposing players. This usually requires some large amounts of firepower. The graphic style becomes very brutal at certain times because during a fight, players will often get certain limbs blown off. The pseudo-realistic graphics make it humorous and gross at the same time. Sometimes, players will even run around with no heads. The gameplay is almost similar to other third person shooters; the main thing that makes it different is the customization available in weapons which allows players to see many different combinations. As players die they will drop their weapon allowing other players on either team to pick up the dropped weapon. This adds a bit to gameplay because of the large variety of weapons.\n\nGame Modes\nThere are currently two types of game modes available. The first mode is a team death match mode where players will try and demolish each other. As players die, they will drop certain items that other players can pick up. If a player on the same team picks up this item, it will deny a kill, but if a player on the opposite team picks up the item, they will get a kill instead. The other mode is a dominion-type mode where the teams need to capture, defend, and attack points. These points will decide the final verdict of a winner. As the points are being captured, players will fight one another to try and stop the capture from the opposing team. I preferred the death matches over the base captures, mainly because I prefer to mindlessly kill during while playing these types of games.\n\nWeaponcrafting\nWeaponcrafting is Loadout’s strongest point. Players can use parts to craft and customize guns earned from playing matches. This is their weapon customization which appeals to a lot of players. It offers a large variety of customization and every aspect can be earned in-game. Players can choose from lasers to machine guns and they can also add effects to them such as fire or mine detonation. All the stats are displayed on the screen, which also display the stats that will change when switching certain properties on a gun. My person favorite thing to do was using a cluster rocket launcher with a fire effect on it. With this system in place, players were basically encouraged to make very bizarre weapons. Since players dropped their weapons as they died, it provided a chance for other players to pick up those weapons and see the different combinations that are possible.\n\nCharacter Customization\nThe customization of a default character is non-existent. Players can choose to customize their characters in the outfitter. The outfitter provides a large selection of outfits, but most of them need to be bought. There are a few things that can be changed without a cost, but those small changes. Although it costs quite a bit, most players could probably buy all they want without having to worry much as long as they stay active. The customization is pretty vast if that’s the case. I think it’s important to have it accessible for most players and with this system, it’s mostly fair.\n\nCurrency\nSpacebux are obtainable after every round through roulette and it can also be bought with real money. This may mislead people into thinking it gives an extreme advantage to some players, but it does not. The main reason comes from another form of currency which is for weapon upgrades. Upgrade points are another form of points a player must collect to upgrade their weapons to the next tier. Certain pieces need different amounts of upgrade points. This limits the gun advantage so most of the purchases for spacebux would probably go towards the customization of a character. Who wouldn’t want to make their character look snazzy?\n\nOverview\n\nGraphics – 4/5 – The graphics are smooth and match the settings of the world really well.\n\nGameplay – 3.5/5 – The gameplay is semi-generic but the guns make it much more interesting.\n\nCustomization – 4/5 – Customization is the strongest point of Loadout Given outfits mainly need to be obtained with spacebux, it’s still completely possible to fully customize your own character.\n\nCommunity – 3/5 – Players aren’t as hateful as other games seeing as Loadout is a much less serious game than other shooters, but since action is always going, conversations don’t really get started.\n\nFeatures – 3/5 – There aren’t many features other than the customizations and the fact players can jump high. Nothing really stands out in terms of special features.\n\nOverall – 3.5/5 – Overall, the game is great. I really enjoyed it and I personally think it’s worth a try if a person is willing.","January 18, 2014","true","13.7"," 55 of 89 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","55","89","0","9"

It is great in so many ways, fast paced, fluent, and totally bad ♥♥♥!\n\nI like how none of the maps restrict you from your movement style, they are not linear at all. You pretty much go *anywhere* on the maps, if it looks like you could make it to any given spot, chances are you can! It's awesome! So much better than extremely "flat" and boring maps that I have seen in played in different types of shooters in the past  few years.\n\nPersonality - This game has it and then some. The characters are SO funny and well animated, they literally make me laugh out loud every time I play this game. In addition, the gore is so satisfying in this game, plentiful and very good looking (You can turn off the gore if you aren't into that.) as well as the sound that is made when you get a kill on someone! Speaking of getting a kill, this game has THE BEST death animations EVER. Funniest that I have ever seen and it really just adds so much feeling and personalty to the game and I love it.\n\nFantastic game all around and I very highly recommend it, so... what are you waiting for?!?

Combined with fast paced combat, Loadout's got an old-school feel that will appeal to fans of the Quake and Unreal Tournament franchises. It's also just a great looking game.\n\nBuilt on EoR's in-house engine, it lets the dev team produce content at an extraordinary rate. The art team spits out beautiful cosmetics like no other, the complex balancing system is handled with admirable speed, and major updates occur with surprising frequency. EoR's done a great job managing and refining the game so far, and I look forward to its future.\n\nLast but not least, the community is great. I'm definitely biased (I'm a forum morderator - ComradBlack, feel free to reach out to me), but the Loadout community has proven itself to be a fantastic and supportive place, where new folks are always welcome. Not only that, but the devs have proven to be exceptionally active; the community manager and several designers post on the forums regularly, and the CEO of the company is one of the most active members (Hi Rob).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelam43/recommended/208090/","xelam43","[NWE] Dreamz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelam43/","121 products in account","Back in the 90s, shooters were all the rage. They were fast and furious, with none of the slower, sneaky, stealthy, cover-based gameplay of today’s modern shooters. The days of Quake and Unreal Tournament were glorious times – but sadly, there have been very few fast-paced shooters of any real quality recently.\n\nBut one developer – called Edge of Reality – has been beavering away on a new shooter called Loadout which aims to bring back some of the twitchy shooter gameplay of the good old days. I’ll admit that this game completely slipped under my radar until a few weeks ago, and the fact that it’s free-to-play didn’t exactly get me too enthused. There’s bound to be some caveat; there always is with F2P, right?\n\nLoadout is purely multiplayer: there’s no campaign and no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about. It’s a good old shooter that’s played over multiple game modes that we’re all familiar with, but with a twist to their names and objectives. Blitz (control points), Death Snatch (grab points dropped by killed opponents), Extraction (gather Blutonium) and Jackhammer (CTF) are all available on the game’s four maps that released when it launched.\n\nLoadout\nLots of leaping around is required\nOddly enough, Edge of Reality decided that Loadout would work best as a third-person shooter. When the gameplay is fast you want to see everything around you and not necessarily your own back, so I thought the view in Loadout would be a real hindrance to my less-than-excellent FPS abilities. The good news is that third-person actually works really well and it’s something you don’t even notice after playing for a while. But why third-person?\n\nThe only reason I can think of as to why this is not a first-person shooter is the game’s art style. Edge of Reality have created a game that shares visual similarities with Team Fortress 2, focusing on being cartoony and over-the-top. There are currently three (excellent drawn and animated) characters to choose from: the Sly Stallone look-alike Axl, the Mr. T-inspired T-Bone, and the rather hideous Helga. There’s been a lot of care and attention put into these characters and that’s important when you’re playing a game that uses customisation as a selling point.\n\nLoadout\nWe go all Disco because it makes you a better shot. OK, that’s a lie.\nBut it’s not just the characters. Loadout‘s big selling point, apart from being free-to-play, is that you can heavily customise your weapons. There are four basic weapon types: the laser-like Beam, the explosive Launchers, the bullet-spewing Rifle, and the cannonball-launching Pulse. These are the base weapons players build upon to make new and interesting tools of destruction.\n\nAs there are no classes in Loadout the weapons play an integral part in how you build your characters. For example: you can be a healer by creating a Beam weapon that fires healing rays, or you could become a sniper by equipping a powerful scope on one of the base weapons. The way you customise your weapons is down to you. That’s why the game is called Loadout. Genius.\n\nEach player can create their new weapons, give them a unique name and then create a loadout (there it is again) from their array of created weapons to take with them into matches. These loadouts are selected at the start of a match but can also be switched mid-game when you die. There’s huge scope for experimentation, and it’s trial-and-error as to whether you can actually kill stuff with your creation. What looks like a good weapon on paper could be utter crap, depending on your skill level.\n\nLoadout\nOur first attempt at weapons.\nNot all the weapon enhancements are available at the beginning of the game, as most need to be unlocked by playing and levelling up your profile. The more you play, the more you’re rewarded with the game’s main currency – Blutes – which can be spent to unlock new enhancements. There’s no pay-to-win rubbish on weapon enhancements, but there is a tech tree which has to be opened up to access new weapon features. This unlocking system is a problem when you want to try a new weapon feature but you can’t because it’s further up the tree. You’ll need to keep playing to earn more Blutes and possibly spend them in areas you may not necessarily want to, just to reach your goal.\n\nThe game’s other currency is SpaceBux, and this is where real cash comes into play. The main use for this currency is character customisation such as new outfits or emotes. You can ignore this completely and just play the game, but if you want to stand out then the quickest way is to drop some cash. The problem is that it’s not cheap, which is a real shame because the items that are available look great.\n\nAs an example, £13.99 will give you 16000 SpaceBux. A helmet costs around 1499 SB, a toothpick is 999 SB and a pair of Assless pants is 8999 SB. For your £13.99 you may get one really cool outfit but not much else. If you want to look the business in-game, then you’re paying top dollar for it.\n\nPerhaps a rethink on some of the pricing would be a good idea, as everyone would enjoy seeing more visually appealing characters playing, and not loads of players using the three standard characters and outfits. That said, anyone who sticks with Loadout will probably think it’s money well spent.\n\nSpaceBux can also be spent on an XP boost for periods of time to help unlock stuff on the tech tree quicker or to add extra loadout slots. If you really want to start messing about with the customisation then it’s quicker to do it that way, but again, it costs more. Damn you F2P!\n\nCharacter customisation and emotes in action\n\n\nLoadout is new and it’s got potential but it’s too early to say whether it will be embraced by shooter fans due to the fact there are only four maps and everyone is still finding their feet. Having sunk quite a few hours into the game now (and failed miserably at topping the end-of-match leaderboards) I’ve found it pretty enjoyable for a quick fix each day.\n\nMessing around with the weapons is fun but it can be time-consuming to find the right fit as not every addition is useful on all base weapons, and the fact you need to keep playing to unlock more weapon features up the tech tree could get tiresome. If you’re a shooter whizz then you’ll probably be racking up the kills so this won’t be an issue for you – you just need to stick at it.\n\nEdge of Reality has created a tasty shooter with fantastic customisation but it’s going to be down to the individual as to whether they can stick with it for long enough to really make good use of the potential within. Free-to-play isn’t easy to get right and I’m not sure if Edge of Reality has completely nailed it. They have to make money somehow, but the items are overpriced and progression may be a little frustrating for less-than-stellar players who doesn’t want to part with cash. If, on the other hand, you don’t really give a toss about buying stuff, then this is still a shooter worth your time.\n\nMonetisation aside, the game plays well, the maps are well designed, and the characters are great. The funny emotes will probably wear thin eventually and the death animations will become old hat, but with the addition of more content like maps and game modes, Loadout has a fighting chance to gather a following – even if it’s not doing anything super-original.\n\nIt’s a refreshing change to be playing a speedy shooter like the good old days, and with Loadout being free-to-play, it’s certainly worth a shot. Boom boom.","December 21, 2014","true","31.0"," 37 of 62 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","37","62","7","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/recommended/208090/","Arrgeron","Morse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/","602 products in account","Honestly, Loadout is one of the best F2P games to be released on steam in a LONG time. Now, I know what you're thinking. The game is definitely P2W, right? No. Not in any way. You can buy these coins, but they don't give you a competitive edge in the game in any way. They simply buy cosmetics and XP boosts, thats it. You can't use them to buy gun parts, those you can ONLY buy with the in game currency.\n\nNow, Loadout is a multiplayer arena shooter in the similar style of Quake and Unreal tournement. You battle different players, or bots, in different matches that typically last 10-15 minutes each. The combat is very enjoyable and satisfying, mainly because of its chaotic nature. One moment you can think you have the advantage on a player, then they pull out their rocket launcher and shoot your face off. Literally. Or their teamates can bombard you with lazer beams. Its a lot of fun.\n\nThe gun customization is definitely the "gimmick" of this game. You build weapons based on 4 different catagories: Rifle, Rocket, Pulse, and Beam. You can make hundreds of different combinations of each. Some combinations will probably be more effective than others, but honestly I think it depends on the playstyle. The way you buy parts is similar to upgrading a skill tree. You get points from battles, based on if you win or lose, and how well you did. Those points are used to upgrade your weapon of choice. And no, you cannot buy in game currency. You can buy Game currency boosts, which increase the rate that you get the in game points, but you cannot outright buy them. Its simply a boost.\n\nSome people have an issue with the vulgarity of this game. I really don't understand, there are a lot of games much more vulgar than this one. I find its charm is in the artstyle and slight vulgarity of it. I think people like to look for things to complain about in F2P titles, because they assume they are always P2W.\n\nIn the end, its a free to play title. If you don't trust my opinion, go try it yourself. Its 2 GB, won't take very long. And you'll see, just like I have, that this is probably the best F2P game in a long time.\n\n(Taking this part from you, Alisa)\nPros:\n+Lots of gun combinations\n+Great gunplay\n+Awesome maps\n+Strong community\n+Not P2W\n+Great art style\n+Fun and innovative game modes\n\nCons\n-Some immaturity in the community(typical of a F2P game)\n-Some combinations aren't as useful, I've found\n-Limited gun types(4)","February 4, 2014","true","35.0"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","24","38","0","1"

No catch to that, you can't buy weapons or upgrades with your money. You CAN buy outfits for your characters though that are badass/scary/hilarious.

There's so many different combinations to have and weapon attachments to equip.\n-There's a Daily Prize that'll show up after a match (doesn't matter if you win or lose, it'll show for you) where you pick 1 of 3 crates in front of you. Most of the time they'll contain blutes (the in-game currency) and on rare occasions, a cosmetic item for your character.\n\nIt's fun! It's free! It's addicting!

The level up mechanic makes the game really boring otherwise though. Watching a guy who can take your entire clip to the face turn around and one shot you with his higher level weaponry doesn't really give a good starting point for new players.\n\nIf you're willing to stick around past that though you might get to mess around with the really interesting and varied weapon design. In my brief time with the game I came up with tons of cool weapon concepts that I'd love to be able to put into practice. I however don't have the patience to sit through a game for that many hours just to try a new stock or barrel on a gun. If you do, this game might be worth your time.\n\nAs far as free to play games go this one isn't too bad. Most things that affect gameplay are tied to the in-game currency, which is always welcome. Every single cosmetic item however is for real world money. If you want to look unique, you're going to be spending some cash.\n\nIn summary, this game isn't my cup of tea, but I can see the appeal. If they ever implement some form of matchmaking so I'm against other new players instead of people with days of game time logged I'll probably be back. Until then, I can't really recommend this.","February 25, 2014","false","0.3"," 45 of 78 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","45","78","0","3"

As you can see, I've played a fair bit of it.\n\nBut I cannot recommend the game in its current form. As other reviewers have pointed out, the developers have abandoned the PC version in favour of the PS4 version. It went from being an arena shooter to being a grindy borefest which forces you to do missions you couldn't care less about in order to get weapon parts. What I liked about the game was ease of access to weapon parts and being able to just jump into a server to play for a bit. Of course, that obviously wasn't making enough money, so they set up a gear treadmill and fundamentally ♥♥♥♥ed over the Arena Shooter aspect of it for grinding.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed this game for a while, I can't forgive what they've done with it.

I really want to say I like this game. I really do. But I don't. Because it's a concept that, while fun for a while, wears of quickly. "Hey, I can build a gun. Right, [Insert Elevator Music and 5 hours] okay, seems solid. Let's try it out. [The battlefield is full of people rolling faster than wheels] I can't... hit.. anything.." The gunplay is just.. horrible. With Semi-Auto weapons: The only weapon you could even hope to be able to one-shot someone is a sniper with a headshot. But people just keep rolling or sprinting, so you've got no chance with the stupid sized hitboxes. Semi-Auto rocket launchers just make people look at you like: "Are you bloody mad? This is a game about spouting as much junk from the nozzle of a gun as possible! Begone with your fancy single-fire explosives!". Full auto: There are only some combinations that work. You'll find that out very quickly if you're playing ranked matches. It's essentially pulse rifle, electricity gun, beam weapon or nothing. Full auto shotguns, out of the question. Nobody uses those. Submachine guns? Nope. Miniguns? Nope. Assault rifles? Definately not. Because it's either a gun that spits giant spiky balls of death like nobodies business, or it's uncle dave's experimental wunderwaffe-dg2 replica. Or iron man's fist. The rest is invalid, because it doesn't deal enough damage. The weapons need a lot more balancing, people need to be easier to kill, and rolling needs to go, or be nerfed. Movement needs major attention. It's buggier than any other game I've played, and that says something.\n\nThe business model isn't great. You can have 3 loadouts by level 20, and leveling isn't that easy. Anything else you have to buy with premium currency. Can't remember how many weapons you can have, but not that many. The earnable currency is fairly standard aquisition, although it takes a good while to get a sufficient gun.\n\nDo I reccomend this game? Not right now. Maybe they'll fix the problems. But until this game gets a bit of an overhaul, I can only reccomend it to someone who really doesn't want to spend any money. There are so many much better games out there. The weapon customization is a gimmick at best. They failed badly on the main selling point of the game, and that means this game gets a "Not Reccomended."","October 3, 2015","false","15.1"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","0"

Not a pay to win, only thing you have to use real money for is character clothing, which you can get in daily prizes. Cuztomize your gun until it fits you best, with tons of customizable attachments and more. The game just got out of Beta, so the game is a bit buggy, some reason being, disconecting from servers for no reason and low ping issues. Getting into a match can take a while, a lot of people leaving lobbies, and people not readying will make you wait in lobby for roughly 3 minutes. Theres 3 characters to choose from (more comming soon probably) there is no difference for which one you pick which is kind of dissapointing. matches are very unbalanced, you can get in matches with level 20's when your level 1. The game is very fast pased and when your in a gun fight, your not going to go in cover rather your going to run around going guns blazing and jumping around. My biggest issue with this game though is that the game is so boring when you play with out a friend, if I dont have a friend with me to play, I will play one match to get my daily prize and I will stop playing, the reason being that the game is boring is that the game has very little variety, and when you have a friend, you will have someone to laugh with and have a good time with. The whole idea of the game is to customize and win, the wepon customization is probably one of the best wepon customizations I have ever seen, it isnt like Call of duty were you can put a cammo and a silencer and a red dot, instead you can shoose the wepon barell, the scope, what kind of bullets, stock, and much more customizable stuff. I would not recomend this game if you dont have a friend to play with. And let me say that any computer can run this game, my friends windows XP can run this game at 28 FPS. If you ever get bored with a friend  and looking for something to do, this game will be the perfect choice. Only good when you have a friend to play with.","February 9, 2014","true","12.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The setting is unoriginal and generic, the characters cartoonish and ugly, and the gameplay over-the-top and messed up beyond belief. Combine that all together, and you get a love you either can't stand, or love beyond belief. And I went with the latter.\n\nLoadout is fun. That's all it really is, fun. There's no stress you might get from other FPS/TPS games like CoD or Borderlands, mostly because of the fact you can't take this game seriously. The creators did everything they can to deliver a game that'll make you lose or die with a smile on your face, without feeling the frustration from similar games. Of course, this doesn't apply to everyone, but you get the general point here.\n\nThe weapon customization is awesome. Instead of choosing stock guns from different categories, you can design it in any way you want, from snipers to mini-guns to healing rocket launchers and whatnot. Even though some combinations might be considered "OP", it's all about the way you use it, or the way you dodge it. I have to agree the balance tends to tilt a teeny bit from time to time, but you can find that in a lot of similar games. The main point is, you can be as creative as you want with them,\n\nThe game modes currently available are Blitz (Control Points), Jackhammer (Capture the Flag), Death Snatch (Kill Confirmed), Extraction and Annihilation. The first three are what they are: Blitz is a simple "capture the control point" mode, where you need to stand on a point long enough to capture it, and 6 captures will decide the game. Jackhammer is basically Capture the Flag with a hammer instead of the flag that allows you to smack your enemies in one shot. Death Snatch is that CoD game mode with Blutonium (ore) instead of dog tags, and the most fun if you just like killing people. Extraction involves collecting the beforementioned ore enough times to win, and Annihilation is pretty much a combination of the first 3 mentioned game modes, also known as the "Competitive" mode.\n\nOf course, the game isn't perfect. The outfits are awfully expensive (but look epic), the server still bugs out from time to time, and the party system might still throw your friends into the enemy team, even if there's enough space in the lobby. But then again, the game's still fresh, so they're expected issues.\n\nIn overall, this is currently one of the best F2P shooters out there. It's easy to pick up and play, a lot of fun to play with friends, and just insane in overall. If you're more of a serious gamer, it's best to stay away from this (although giving it a try won't hurt). If you're a casual(ish) gamer, give it a shot. And if you're a flying grapefruit like me, you'll absolutely love this game. Even if it's just to see yourself walking around with a giant hole in your body, or with just a brain and eyes, Loadout is fun for every game who likes to have a laugh every now and then while shooting off someone's head or arm. It's mindless fun with rather mindless characters.","February 14, 2014","true","4.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

The first three are what they are: Blitz is a simple "capture the control point" mode, where you need to stand on a point long enough to capture it, and 6 captures will decide the game. Jackhammer is basically Capture the Flag with a hammer instead of the flag that allows you to smack your enemies in one shot. Death Snatch is that CoD game mode with Blutonium (ore) instead of dog tags, and the most fun if you just like killing people. Extraction involves collecting the beforementioned ore enough times to win, and Annihilation is pretty much a combination of the first 3 mentioned game modes, also known as the "Competitive" mode.\n\nOf course, the game isn't perfect. The outfits are awfully expensive (but look epic), the server still bugs out from time to time, and the party system might still throw your friends into the enemy team, even if there's enough space in the lobby. But then again, the game's still fresh, so they're expected issues.\n\nIn overall, this is currently one of the best F2P shooters out there. It's easy to pick up and play, a lot of fun to play with friends, and just insane in overall. If you're more of a serious gamer, it's best to stay away from this (although giving it a try won't hurt). If you're a casual(ish) gamer, give it a shot. And if you're a flying grapefruit like me, you'll absolutely love this game. Even if it's just to see yourself walking around with a giant hole in your body, or with just a brain and eyes, Loadout is fun for every game who likes to have a laugh every now and then while shooting off someone's head or arm. It's mindless fun with rather mindless characters.","February 14, 2014","true","4.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

Maybe a bit scant on deeper game modes, and the inclusion of a free-for-all deathmatch seems like just a skill-tester to keep idiots out of the real team-based objective modes.\n\nThe weapon crafting is fun. I haven't been able to dig into it since after the limited access beta, so it's infuriating to see so many weapon properties locked out right now, but when you have everything available, it's incredibly fun to use strange and exotic weaponry, and picking up and trying out other people's weapons is always a blast. Weapon crafting in games always hooks me, and this is no different.\n\nThe art style is fine, but the humor leaves quite a bit to be desired. balls. asses. Laughing yet? It's really puerile, and not so great as a result, but the game stands without it, so I hope they don't continue to bear down and focus on the lame parts of the setting/theme.\n\nI'm recommend you try it, but just because of the current structure of the unlocks and the hamfisted crude humor, I'm slightly reticent to give it an unwavering "Yes."","February 5, 2014","true","20.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Right off the bat I didn't enjoy the fact that I had to purchase customizable items for my character with real money but it's nice to see that it's not the only way to acquire cutomizable items and weapon customization is strictly with in game points you get after every match. Their are two different types of gameplay, one is for a more general and fun experience to be had with not much of a competitive feel to it while the other is more for competition. This is what I like mainly because it attracts both Casual and Hardcore audiences.

The setting is unoriginal and generic, the characters cartoonish and ugly, and the gameplay over-the-top and messed up beyond belief. Combine that all together, and you get a love you either can't stand, or love beyond belief. And I went with the latter.\n\nLoadout is fun. That's all it really is, fun. There's no stress you might get from other FPS/TPS games like CoD or Borderlands, mostly because of the fact you can't take this game seriously. The creators did everything they can to deliver a game that'll make you lose or die with a smile on your face, without feeling the frustration from similar games. Of course, this doesn't apply to everyone, but you get the general point here.\n\nThe weapon customization is awesome. Instead of choosing stock guns from different categories, you can design it in any way you want, from snipers to mini-guns to healing rocket launchers and whatnot. Even though some combinations might be considered "OP", it's all about the way you use it, or the way you dodge it. I have to agree the balance tends to tilt a teeny bit from time to time, but you can find that in a lot of similar games. The main point is, you can be as creative as you want with them,\n\nThe game modes currently available are Blitz (Control Points), Jackhammer (Capture the Flag), Death Snatch (Kill Confirmed), Extraction and Annihilation. The first three are what they are: Blitz is a simple "capture the control point" mode, where you need to stand on a point long enough to capture it, and 6 captures will decide the game. Jackhammer is basically Capture the Flag with a hammer instead of the flag that allows you to smack your enemies in one shot. Death Snatch is that CoD game mode with Blutonium (ore) instead of dog tags, and the most fun if you just like killing people. Extraction involves collecting the beforementioned ore enough times to win, and Annihilation is pretty much a combination of the first 3 mentioned game modes, also known as the "Competitive" mode.\n\nOf course, the game isn't perfect.

But then again, the game's still fresh, so they're expected issues.\n\nIn overall, this is currently one of the best F2P shooters out there. It's easy to pick up and play, a lot of fun to play with friends, and just insane in overall. If you're more of a serious gamer, it's best to stay away from this (although giving it a try won't hurt). If you're a casual(ish) gamer, give it a shot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ocfos/recommended/208090/","Ocfos","Ocfos²³","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ocfos/","264 products in account","This game is the most gore-filled TPS I have ever played, and I'm saying that as a good thing. It is incredibly fun to play alone, or alongside up to 3 friends by using the in-game party feature. I am unsure if you can make a party of more than 4 people, but every match is 4v4 regardless of what you do.\nIt is hysterical and very much a "Dudebro humor" filled game, full of ridiculous costumes, taunts, and even the gamemodes themselves are really just filled to the brim with dark humor. When you die, your leg can fly off, you can lose your skull and run around with nothing but a brain and eyes for a head, you can explode into tiny bits, and you can give someone the finger post-mortem. That's just a few examples of death-scenes.\n\nThe free-to-play part of this game is hardly noticable, as the only things you can buy is cosmetics, taunts, and boosts to experience and "Blutes". Blutes is the currency used in upgrading your weapons, which you can only obtain through actually playing matches. Experience doesn't mean much, apart from rewarding you with extra blutes per level gained, and some avatars. It is extremely well-done, and I have not seen anyone actually complaining about it, other than the "I want to look like X, but I don't have the money." complaints, which is to be expected.\nWhile I'm at it,\n\nThe key of this game, though, is the gun making. There is so many things you can stick onto your weapon, and make it function just like you want it to. A rocket launcher that shoots rebounding, time-triggered, fire mines? Doable. A shotgun that shoots healing bullets and has surface-rebounding bullets? Also doable. That sniper rifle that shoots electric projectiles that you really dreamed of making? Also doable. Of course, some things work out better than others, but that spooling trigger on your sniper rifle didn't really fit well in there either way, did it? Oh, and you can name a weapon what-ever your heart desires. Just don't name it something racistic, sexist, or otherwise offensive, as you will most likely be reported for it eventually. (Done by pressing F7, in case you need it.)\n\nThe gamemodes are what you would normally expect from an FPS game, and include;\n\nJackhammer - Capture the Flag, but you can use the Hammer to attack 5 times, and get bonus points for killing and delivering the hammer.\n\nBlitz - Control Points, where you raise a pair of boxer shorts at a random place located around the map. Once captured, the next point swaps to a random flagpole location around the map.\n\nExtraction - Gathering, except you can only have one "Gatherer" (Which you should try to kill very fast on the opposing side) per team, which can pick up the Blutonium crystals placed all over the map. The crystals can be used as  a grenade-like weapon, in case you need to defend yourself before getting to a drop-point.\n\nDeath Snatch - Kill Confirmed-like gamemode, where you basically kill someone and they drop a vial of Blutonium. Just like other FPS games, you can pick up dropped allied vials, and deny the enemy the kill.\n\nAnnihilation - A mix of everything combined, except for Extraction. Each team has a base, and your goal is to raise enough points for your team to be able to lower the enemy ship shields. Pretty straightforward once you get used to it.\n\nThere's a last option called "Custom Game", which is advertised as "Coming soon ;)".\n\nAll in all, I can safely say that I have had so much fun with this game in the just 17 hours I've played of it so far, and I predict that number will rise very fast in the near future.\n\nI heavily recommend everyone remotely interested in a game like this to at the very least try it out. Since it's Free-To-Play, you don't really have any excuse not to, either way!\n\nEDIT: I forgot to add that you can try out any weapon combination you want, before you buy it. The only requirement for testing something out is that you own it, or you have access to buying it for Blutes.","February 21, 2014","true","24.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It plays very fast-paced for a 4v4 arena shooter, and is extremely easy to get into. Using a variety of weapon mods to make your own novel (and questionably effective) gun is a great concept. Its F2P model is also extremely fair, and uses common sense as its compass for avoiding the proverbial "pay-to-win" stigma.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who asked. Support for the pc version has been indecisive at best, as they released a balance/bugfix patch last March, but before that, it was near a year. The Playstation version of the game is doing much better off, but it's a bit disheartening to see the pc version in stark neglect, and in turn, its playerbase whiddling down to merely a stagnant collective of familiar veterans who are not newplayer-friendly.","May 8, 2015","false","10.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

You can buy the early access pack now and that gives you a few beta-exclusive clothes and a handful of ingame and cash currency. It features a robust and in-depth weapon customization system as well as an impressive amount of wearables for your character. As of now, you can only buy cosmetic items with cash points starting as low as 99cents for a few hundred points. You can upgrade and customize your weapon using ingame currency you earn from playing matches. As for the game itself, its fast paced and over the top, shooting homing missiles, laser beams, or plasma blasts you dispose of your opponents in a variety of different ways while rushing to complete a match particular objective. Gameplay can be hectic and overwhelming for those not used to this kind of game, but the style and fun of it makes it well worth giving it a shot.

It's gory and bloody which makes it all the better! The gun customization is very nice as you can upgrade your ammo capacity, ammo type, scope ect. There's also different gamemodes you can play on, my favorite being capture the flag which is pretty self-explanatory. There's also a variety of maps to play on which allow you to never get bored of the same map.\n\nTL:DR\nYou can blow peoples heads off. 8/10.","October 2, 2014","true","8.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

Answer no why well for starters with such a broken match making system it makes it unplayable sometimes example i'm a average player against non veterans/♥♥♥♥♥♥ i can get 40-50 kills to maybe 11-20 deaths but then there are those games where it is 2v4 - 3v4 - 1v3 and the auto balance doesn't kick in due to glitch or just doesn't which means if you are on little team you are going to lose most of the game types besides Death snatch require at least a good full team this new one is one of them domination 3 points with 2v3-3v4 is just death to little team cause the 4 man group split to each point whil you are offf all trying to either kill the person taking a point or trying to get another and at the very end of the game as you literally lose a player gets put on your team or joins into game.\n\n2nd - Broken ♥♥♥♥ weapons there are literally classes in this non class based game there are hundreds of guns you can make but all you will see are these: Charge beam rifle/Heavy duty rocket/Pusle lightning shotgun/Bolt action sniper rifle. Trust me if you haven't seen these at least 3 times in a row you haven't played Loadout. everyone uses them everyone gets easy kills with them cause why have a fair balance system when you can literally put rocket boots on + heavy duty rocket and just 2 shot everyone and their dog it is not fun PERIOD i like to be on even playing fields and then ya get people "Just shot them out of sky" Ok so i'm ment to kill them before they fire two rockets in span on 2 seconds? 2 second window to win this fight?! so fair. Beams and shields now i swear this is just a game ruiner every ♥♥♥♥ will just chuck on a beam charged 1 hit rifle and take 95% of health away then zap you with beam lightning gun and how do you fight them? You dont cause they just pop this new shield and take a ♥♥♥♥ing nukes worth of damage and before you even drop shield you are already dead.\n\n3rd - Why not try bots? Cause the bots are a ♥♥♥♥ing joke no wait no they are not cause a joke is actaully ment to be funny these ♥♥♥♥ers put wall hackers to shame get 1 or more bots using a assault rifle you have already lost i have seen a game of level 30's+ take on 4 assault rifle bots and get ♥♥♥♥ing rolled why? Cause they have 5x damage of human players auto aim you before you come around walls and even shoot into walls as you are coming around and then still kill they have unlimited clipped ammo so they never stop firing and also don't even bother trying to dodge roll cause they just trace you like a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥ combine all that with rockets + tesla pusle bots you also just get ♥♥♥♥ed so hard bots are not hard though this is the thing i have to point out if you literally just camp with (Sniper/Rockets/Beams) You can just walk over bots but that is boring and ♥♥♥♥ing unfun i want to get into the action and get up close but i cant when the bots have already killed me before i even ♥♥♥♥ing know my next move.\n\nTL:DR - This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke some of the design choices are so ♥♥♥♥ing dumb they make COD look fun.\n\n+WARNING+ New players beware the veterans have no mercy and will make you hate this game after 1 match cause you will get match maked with level 30+ and you will die and you will leave.\nI'm level 40 and i still leave some games why? Cause i am sick of being 1 ♥♥♥♥ing shotted.","February 25, 2014","false","237.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Yes friends, Loadout has at long last arrived, and with it your prayers for a mature, sophisticated, quadruple A shootbanger have been answered. Gaze my friends, gaze upon the flawlessly executed character design that is so rife with jiggle bones and over-the-top personality (sprinkled with a sizeable dosage of pop culture references) that you've already ordered body pillows for every character before you've even played the game. But that's not all my friends, oh no that's only the tip of the phallus. Let your eyes linger on the DEEP weaponcrafting of Loadroute, for it is truly an eyegasmic experience for the whole family to enjoy. Stare in bewilderment, let your jaw slacken and your jowls quiver with succulent anticipation as you piece together your very own instrument of Hasbro approved destruction. Upon it's completion you receive a standing ovation from everyone you've ever loved as you christen your newfound love with whatever combination of ♥♥♥♥ and balls suits your deluded fancy, and then, OOHhhhHH THHEEENN, the REAL games start. Then it turns into an enjoyably casual twitch shooter version of TF2 without any of the stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or forced character personality, and it even has the capacity to be my favorite if I could stop having so many BadDragon marketers forcibly testing their newest products on me every time I try to shootbang.","February 3, 2014","true","14.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

It's very enjoyable and recently got out of Early Access, in spite of it being there for about maybe a year. During that time, I did play it and I didn't enjoy it. When I saw this pop back up, I was like "Ugh this ♥♥♥♥ game, eh might as well give it a try, the trailers make it look good." Thank you trailers for making me download this game.\n\nLoadout is COMPLETELY free,  unless you wanna buy more gun slots, loadouts and clothing for your characters, which is un-need at all times unless you wanna outfit your character. In F2P form, you get 4 guns slots and 2 loadouts. Blutes are what are used as In-game currency. It helps you buy gun parts. The whole idea of this game is to build your own gun and kill other people. What else is there to like?\n\nThe gameplay plays WONDERFULLY. In beta, since I played it, the game wasn't that fun but, now that its fully out, Its a really fun and enjoyable game. The graphics aren't BF4 level or HL2 level, but it is a good engine. It doesn't look like it's from 2004. The one thing I enjoy about this game is the blood effects. When you get shot, say in the leg, you can see the bone and blood gushs everywhere. The blood and gore is just insane on this game. It's too much for some people (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)\n\nFinal verdict: Download this game, give it a try. It won't hurt. Trust me, it's a really fun and enjoyable game best played with friends. Though since it did just get out of Early Access, it still has some minor bugs but, the team of this game (Edge of Reality?) are doing very well at updating the game and making it stable 9/10.","February 10, 2014","true","14.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Unlock new weapon mods in your tech tree and level them up, etc  Great fun!\n\nGametypes in both PvP and PvBots (co-op) are:\n\n* Blitz (random KOTH cap point)\n* Death Snatch (DM with those killed dropping crystals that need to be collected to confirm kill)\n* Domination (3 x set KOTH points simultaneously)\n* Jackhammer (CTF with "flag" being a melee weapon you can kill with to multiply the cap value)\n* Extraction (1 member of each team is randomly selected as the collecter who picks up crystals and drops them in set collection points, while team defends him or attacks other team's collecter)\n\nEquipment you can unlock includes grenades (explosive, incendiary or tesla), disguise (a bit like TF2 spy, but limited like their cloak is), health/ammo pack drop, trapped health/ammo pack, turret (TF2 engi), jump boots (TF2 scout double jumping), personal shield, and even curved shield wall\n\nProbably the best part of the game are the various weapons including rifle, pulse, beam or rocket, with so many different types of mods to make short-range instakiller, great mid-ranged variations, sniper, pyro, area-of-effect, sticky mines, even walking bombs, etc, etc  So many different possibilities!\n\nThe bots (computer-controlled fighters just like the players, not actual robots like in TF2's MvM) can be challenging for low-level players, but with good tactics / teammates, and perseverance you can find ways to beat them.\n\nPvP community lost their Australian servers, unfortunately, but Asia isn't too far away.  Random matches might include high level players that you will get pummelled by, or complete noobs who will make it easy for you to advance in XP and Blutes ($).  Teams are randomised each round (unless you form a party with friends), so you shoulndn't get pummelled every round if you keep at it.  They don't have difficulty levels (except the ranked exhibition matches), but a little perseverance will have you unlocking / levelling up your weapons and equipment and doing well in no time.\n\nIf the gore / profanity / nudity is too much for you, you can just turn off those settings (as I did for the latter two).  Great game, I highly recommend it, and hope to have you in my party soon!","April 30, 2014","true","129.8"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

First and foremost it is an awesome game that can best be described as a 3rd person arena shooter/platformer. The combat is heavily movement based so expect to be jumping, rolling, and sprinting both in and out of combat. This game is fairly fast paced, so expect Times to kill around 1-3 seconds. Weaponcrafting is this game's heart and soul though. You can pretty much create any gun you want if you are willing to take some creative  liberties with it! Examples: railgun? Check! Volcano sniper ala Borderlands? Check! And a million billion other combinations? CHECK!\nThis is a great game that currentley uses the F2P business model (buy cosmetics and other stuff with real money) However the prices are fair and there are a ♥♥♥♥ ton of ♥♥♥♥ing sweet cosmetics. To be honest you can custimize your charecter more than your guns, which is pretty extensive on both ends.\nAlso the developers for this game are awesome, totally on point, and real down to earth. Im not a super important player, however on many occasions through weekly live streams, the Dev's hopping in to our Raidcall, in-game and on the forums I have been able to address them with my personal (yet hopefully valid) issues and always get a good response!\n\nBuy in and experience the ♥♥♥♥♥iness that is LOADOUT","November 26, 2013","true","805.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

NPCs are scattered about for you to test on (NPC's running across a bridge, standing still, behind cover, etc. )\n\nAs far as combat, while it's not quite up there with it, I'd say it's comparable to TF2 as far as how intense multiplayer can get. Don't I haven't been in awhile myself.\n\nDefinetly worth keeping an eye on, at the least.","May 15, 2013","true","6.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Ну т.е рекомендую или нет.\nНу пожалуй рекомендую, в неё поиграть определённо стоит, ещё можно и друзей прихватить (руз уж она free2play).

Being that is not a very popular yet, the servers are mostly empty and usually imbalanced. This would be a lot more fun with a bunch of friends to play with.\n\nThere's two types of currency, one to buy cosmetic items ( only can purchase with real money ) and the other one to buy upgrades ( Blutes: can get in game through playing ).

Just when you thought arena shooters were long dead this game grabs you by the balls and screams at you.\nFree to Play but that doesn't mean Pay to Win, the only things you might want to consider paying for are Extra Loadout and Gun slots aswell as some cosmetic stuff to make your character stand out from others.\n\nThe weapons are diverse and fully customisable (Though you cant colour your weapons to my knowledge hopefully they add that in.) The game is fun, easy to pickup and my god is it satisfying to obliterate somebody with your own gun that you created.\n\nMy only criticism is that the cosmetic stuff for your character is a little pricey and I would like to see a 'item drop' system similar to TF2 or CS:GO. Oh and Achievements (please add achievements i need my fix)\n\nI have seen people criticise this game for its lengthy matchmaking times but c'mon guys it literally JUST went F2P today ofcourse they are going to hit server traffic they have adressed this on Twitter and Facebook and they are working on fixing it now.\n\nAlso this is one of the few games I can think of where I have shot somebody's ♥♥♥♥ off...

It invokes the old school feeling of games like Quake and unreal tournament, while keeping it's own art style and hilarious brutality. While it doesn't break much new ground, the weapon crafting (even in this early stage.) adds a lot of depth (and death) ti what normally would be a kind of shallow game. The characters seem to be either references and stereotypes of DA MANLIEST MEN or complete freaks (such as Helga), which gives more to the comical feel. and speaking of comical, the deaths of your enemies (and yourself) will leave you laughing, chuckling and boisterously cursing at your foes. The deaths range from the unsettling "throwing a tantrum while your skin is burned off" to " missing your upper torso while your legs run around like a headless chicken." to my favorite " a brief pause before silently flipping off your opponent."

NPCs are scattered about for you to test on (NPC's running across a bridge, standing still, behind cover, etc. )\n\nAs far as combat, while it's not quite up there with it, I'd say it's comparable to TF2 as far as how intense multiplayer can get. Don't I haven't been in awhile myself.\n\nDefinetly worth keeping an eye on, at the least.","May 15, 2013","true","6.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is not easy to make a good gun, but that doesn't mean that there's not balance. The more rockets you have in the same magazine, the less damage they do, for example.

First, i will start with the Pros\n\nPROS\n\n- Fast paced (extremely) game. YOu stand still, you're dead.\n\n- INSANE weapon customization. Do you want a laser guided, flaming, timed cluster rocket that creates mines when it misses? You can do that. Want a minigun that shoots healing? You can do that.\n\n- Make the characters your own with the customization system*\n*Sadly uses a real money only system, but if you want to pay money, go ahead!\n\n-The only classes are the ones you create. YOu have two weapon slots, and those could hold anything, YOu could have a healing rocket-launcher with a tesla beam.\n\nI'm not going to say it has only pros.\n\nCONS\n\n- At the moment of writing, it has friend server problems. It sometimes shuts down, and leaves you to not talk with your friends. The party system works during that down time, but it's a little more complicated.\n\n- There is NO other way to customize your character, except for promotions. I get it that you want some prenium only stuff, but ALL of it prenium only? That's too much. Also, you can't but ANYTHING to customize your character with for just 1 dollar. You may think "So, whatever, its not like it matters that much." I would usually agree with you, but how much you CAN customize your character changes it. There is about 15 slots, not including taunts, and everything in all the slots doesn't cost a dollar or less. Thats at least 20 dollars to fully customize your character.\n\n-I feel that there should be more options for weapons, as now, it feels like to small of a world, with people having the same weapon as you. There should be more main types, a couple more elements, and more parts. Also, the game needs weapon customization! The only color your gun can be is an army green, with the elemental effect on your gun only changin part of it (color of rocket, how the barrel looks)\n\nOverall, the game is great, but suffers from the lack of free customization and server issues, I reccommend picking it up and playing it with friends. It's a fast install, its fun, and will keep you happy.\n\nGood luck,\n\nMental1ty (IGN)","February 4, 2014","true","9.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptainUseless/recommended/208090/","CaptainUseless","Captain Useless","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptainUseless/","180 products in account","I suppose for those who are simply scrolling by, here is your answer: This game is not Pay2Win\n\nI REPEAT, THE ONLY ITEMS YOU CAN PURCHASE WITH REAL WORLD CURRENCY ARE TAUNTS, COSMETICS, AVATARS, AND BOOSTER PACKS.\n\nNow that I have gotten the obvious question out of the way, I would like to justify my claims. I've played numerous F2P games, seeing such tragedies like Battlefield Heroes, to games that became F2P, like TF2. I like to believe that I have an eye for Pay2Win games when I see them.\n\nPROBLEMS AT THE MOMENT:\nMatchmaking. This is the obvious one, so much so that people are giving bad reviews based on that alone. Rightfully so, but I will say that there was no way that the Devs could have seen this coming. Back in 2013, there was even a day where the Devs tested the load on the servers, our very own "Crash the Servers" day. This called to action a brave 2K (at the max) players to crash the servers, the servers stood valiantly, and we battled veterans went home with a free t-shirt for it.\nSo take the "stress test group", multiply that by about 13, and you now have the amount of players that are all trying to get on at the moment. It is a real shame, especially since the impatient ones bombed the 24 hour Dev stream, but I can understand their anger. We are getting a cosmetic item for it though. This part of my review shouldn't be here for much longer, so here is a smiley face :)\n\nTHE REVIEW:\n\nWEAPON CUSTOMIZATION AND PARTS:\nThe big gimmick of this game, the weapon customization, is so staggering, that it will take you an eternity to find all the possible weapon combinations. Do you want a bolt action shotgun? Go ahead. How about a rocket launcher where rockets slide along the ground and blow up into tiny rockets? You got it. How about a gun that has rebounding electricity balls? Go for it. Every type of playstyle can be found, all you have to do is think it up.\n\nThe snag to this is the fact that not every weapon part is unlocked at first, they must be unlocked with the in-game currency, Blutes, which you get NOT BY PAYING FOR THEM, but by playing for them. Most parts have the blute equivalence of about 5-10 matches to get them, so if you play for about 30 minutes, you can get your next weapon part. Simple. So for those claiming that this game is Pay2Win due to the boosters, there are no blatanly overpowered items, and some of the strongest weapon combos come from the default items given at the start.\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY:\nThe gameplay is super fast, and twitch aim really comes into play. If I had to compare the gameplay, it plays out like Unreal Tournament. There is rolling, there is high jumping, and there is a maniacal naked man running after me with rocket boots. I can't really put that much description into how the games play out. The best thing about this game, it is free, which means you can try it out for yourself to see how things go. Some tips before you go out there: Rolling puts out fires, jumping and moving keeps you alive, rolling puts out fires, the "flag" in the CTF mode (Jackhammer) is a one-hit kill, and be cautious of your health. Also, rolling puts out fires.\n\nTHE ARTSTYLE:\nIt is based on 80's action heroes, it is over the top cartoony, and it is has a LOT of gore. However, if you are turned away by the inappropriateness of the game, there are always filters in the options. The little humors of the game go a long way, and truly makes it a fun place to Cabbage Patch.\n\nTHE DEVS:\nSome games are incredibly well made, but if the devs are evil, then the game won't go very far. However, these guys are incredible: they are constantly responding on the forums, they are taking suggestions from the community constantly, and they host a Dev livestream every wednesday at 4:00 EST. So if you don't believe me on my claims, then drop on by and see for yourself.\n\nMY PERSONAL GRIPE:\nThis game includes "upgrades" to weapon pieces, making the stats better. With the boosters, this could potentially be controversial. While the "upgrades" are very minimal (one of the upgrades is adding a ".25" increase to damage, not even one whole point of damage), they can stack with all of the weapon parts upgraded. Once again though, these can be bought ONLY with blutes, no real-world money involved, that is a problem with the boosters...if any.\n\nIN CONCLUSION:\nI can only tell you so much about this game. What I think: fun game, fast gameplay, great with friends. If you want a real review, then go into the game and try it out for yourself, it is free!","February 1, 2014","true","101.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

For the most part yes it's an over the shoulder third person shooter, yes it's been done but no, there are NO set weapons.\n\nLoadout actually does what's intended with allowing customisation to not only your character, but your guns as well, mix matching parts and pieces to make something special for you. A few examples of the guns I've made are:\n\n- A minigun that shoots out steel spiked balls rather than bullets\n- A rocket launcher that shoots grenades that split into smaller grenades that heals whoever they hit rather than explode\n- A lazer that takes about 30 seconds to fire one shot, then uses all of it's ammo\n- A gun that shoots bouncing bullets that eventually return to you and kill you\n- A minigun sniper rifle that's actually really useless.\n\nThe list goes on to designs I've not even considered yet. Point is you'll be at this for a considerable amount of time before you actually get to the playing. After building a gun, you can test out whatever you've made on some bots to see if they're effective, useless or cause you to accidentally kill yourself upon using it once.\n\nWhile it is currently Early Access, bugs are bound to happen and issues will occur but the responce times of Edge of Reality's team quickly fixing whatever might crop up and still have time to add more content is amazing in itself so hopefully, the issues that might occur will not last long at all.\n\nAll in all, it's a great deal of fun and laughs, even when the gun backfires and you blow yourself to bits.","November 30, 2013","true","8.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/img4mr/recommended/208090/","img4mr","G4MR | Dat Sleep Schedule","http://steamcommunity.com/id/img4mr/","295 products in account","Such a hilarious fun game.  From what I've seen on the casual portion of match making there are 4 game modes: CTF, Control Point, Kill Confirmed (From Call of Duty) and this Extraction Mode.  Personally KC and Control Point will be the most fun game modes because it's just constant action.  CTF will be a great competitive mode that I think people will enjoy playing.\n\nThere are a ton of weapon customizations from the projectiles you shoot to how fast you shoot them and even different weapon types to fit your needs.  You can have fire rockets, pulse beam sniper, there's just a lot of variation that hits different play styles.\n\nCharacter Cosmetics are hilarious, this game is quite mature so if you're a young person I'd disable the nude option.  Because you can actually have a nude character, butt naked.  That's how extreme and bizarre the cosmetics are in this game, lot of stuff to purchase comestically.\n\nWith this being a F2P game everyone wants to know is ti pay to win?  Not really, there's pay to early a little more xp and in game currency, similar to league of legends, but not really pay to win.  More pay to get ahead faster which if it's a turn off for you that's fine I get it.  It's not as bad as I thought though.\n\nNow there are a lot of things you buy with points such as unlocking different grenades from the tech tree as well as other equipment etc... then there's unlocking attachments for your weapons which can help you figure out the style of play you want to pull off.  Right now I'm not good enough to say if you pay for the xp boosts that you'll get so far ahead because you still have to grind out the games like everyone it's not like those F2P fps games where you pay money and boom you have a weapon.  That's silly and this way is much smarter it rewards people for playing the game, and game modes.\n\nIt's going to be free to play so play it, it's great fun.  You don't have to spend money unless you want to make your character look hilarious.  Other than that, play it try it out and find out for yourself.  Unless you're like me who keeps jumping around FPS games because nothing that has been out has been good enough. ;)\n\nI'd rate this game 8.5/10.  Visually looks great, UI is polished and well done, doesn't about a minute to find a game, tons of ways to customize my weapon/character for my playstyle and the way i want it to look.  There are some minor issues I've had like you need to use -DX11.0 in console to launch the game in fullscreen windowed mode as well as things like removing the ability to join on your friends at any given time.  They might change or fix that sooner or later, but overall the game's enjoyable and relaxing.  I don't give it a 10 because I feel like they could tweak a thing here and there like maybe some in game stuff which indicates what's going on for new players and what not, minor stuff.  Maps for CTF are too big things like that.  More personaly things that others might not agree with.  It's in that 8-9/10 range of fun especially for a game that's going to be free.  Haven't played something this polished in a long time.","January 17, 2014","true","46.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Just expect to drop a lot of cash for cosmetics and be prepared for extremely long matchmaking.","February 1, 2014","true","2.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Try it if you are tired of TF2 or if you want some fast and gore TPS ;)\n\n\n\nTo the developpers ==> Hello, I think it would be a good idea too put some dota-like loot system for cosmetics, like that you could make benefits with an in-game trade system (just like steam does).

Where do i start?\n\nIt's a very fun game, fast paced, constantly in the action, very short respawn times, and nice gunplay.\nThe thing that caught my eye in this game is that there's literally no way to PAY to win, the game is completely about you playing to your skillsets. Unlike other freemium games, where someone with a lot of money spends $30-100 on a single weapon, and completely wipes out the competition; this game has you play to upgrade your weapons, you earn "Blutes" and in turn, spend them on upgrades for one of four weapon chasis, and the combinations are amasing! You can have anywhere from a standard assault rifle, to a healing rocketlauncher, that fires a missile that corkscrews through the air, making it harder to shoot down, (As missiles and projectiles can be shot out of the air).\n\nThe movement is like a mix between gears of war and quake; you can either take it like a modern shooter and make sure you get all of your shots in (Which will get you absolutely destroyed in combat), or you can play how the game is meant to be played; by jumping, rolling, and sprinting head-on into combat. This game doesn't take anything slowly, as you can go from full health to dead in an instant; you have to be on your toes at all times in this game, even when you think you're safe, you can be either ambushed, or even just stumble onto an entire team, with their weapons at the ready.\n\nThere isn't any real reason to spend any money on this game, playing it is fun and free, but you can spend $5-15 dollars, and make your character stand out from the crowd with some cosmetics. As i said, there isn't any way to spend money on your weapons, and I hope they keep it that way. An example would be Combat Arms, on Steam; One weapon can cost an upwards of $70, but it basically destroys anything that catches a glimpse of it.\n\nAll in all, i reccomend this game to anyone who likes fast paced shooters, that require a bit of teamwork. Team Fortress 2 players should get their fill out of this game, as i know i did.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/necropotency/recommended/208090/","necropotency","Ancient","http://steamcommunity.com/id/necropotency/","238 products in account","Really, this game is a top-notch free-to-play.  I'd rank it right up there with the likes of Team Fortress 2.\n\nThe weapons crafting system is where the game really shines.  You earn XP through playing games, and spend the XP buying new parts to build weapons with.  I think there are currently something like 6,000,000,000,000 (yes, Six Billion) possible weapon designs available.\n\nThe artwork is great for what it is, and the effects are just brilliant.  From bouncing, flaming, or electrical bolts flying everywhere to actually seeing the bullet holes and damage in your character, they really paid attention to detail.\n\nThe game modes are great renditions of the classic capture-the-flag and team deathmatch modes that you find in most team shooters.  I found the Ranked Annihilation mode to be awesomely fun - you earn points and choose which buffs to buy your character when you can afford them, between 3 possible choices.  This mode imparticular gives it a moba-ish feel that I really enjoy.\n\nYou're missing out if you do not give this game a try, that's the bottom line.  It's free, but I'd easily be willing to pay 20-25$ if they wanted to charge that for it.  It's certainly that good.  I'll probably be buying the 20$ Steam Starter pack for it soon, too.  Those steampunk goggles look too cool!\n\nTL;DR:  Great game.  10/10 for a Free-to-Play.","February 12, 2014","true","18.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

It features highly customizable weapon choices, I mean.. you can customize a weapon in any way you want (such as fire, electricity, or even normal bullets etc. , beam weapon, rocket launchers, rifles, pulse weapons).\n\n\nBest part: In no way is the game Pay 2 Win. There are two currencies in game: Blutes and Spacebux.\n\nBlute is primaray currency used to buy weapon/gadet upgrades for your weapons. You get it by playing matches and on daily prizes.\nSpacebux is obtain with real money BUT can only be used for buying cosmetics for your characters.\nSo anything gameplay/mechanics related cannot be just skipped to. All gameplay content(maps, game modes, weapons) is available to free 2 play player.\n\nLevel design is awesome, as well as the game modes. My personal favorite is Jackhammer. It's a creatively redesigned Capture the flag game mode, only where flag is a hammer, which you can actually use to slam other players while returning to base. Annihilation is also pretty nice (if im correct, this will be a part of competitive part of the game), its a combination of all game modes put on 1 map.\n\nI saw quite a few people say "The game is a TF2 clone". I don't really see how, the only thing they have in common are the cartoonish graphics.\n\nThe game had some problems on launch with friend lists and matchmaking constantly being down but the developers fixed it quite fast and even gave out free in game cosmetics as an apology. They're really taking a part of the community and listen to people. Keep it up, you guys are awesome!\n\nAs for the cosmetics, if you're down on spending a few bucks you'll be amazed at how many items and taunts are available to buy(most of them really hilarious).\n\nTo sum it all up: You're probably going to have tons of fun and laughs if you play this.","February 20, 2014","true","41.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","4"

You may love this game, for its crude humor and 'random' gameplay. The way you may customise yourself for real money, sure, like TF2, but at least there is an economy. Everything is expensive, too expensive to bother with. My time is precious to me, and I dont want to waste it on the hopes of having fun that may never occur. Drone Drone Drone. I can go on (I wait, I do) Anyway, I probably dislike this game based on the amount of unconditional praise its recieving, or becuase my hatred has festered in my mind, but Alons y. Read on, random viewer.\n\nFine Fine. Ill expand. Im typing this as I think of it, so bear with me. A few niggles I have from a few hours of play are these. Firstly, there are very little maps/gamemodes, but it is a early game, so forgiven. Secondly, they sell themselves as a fully customisable game, but the customisations are not that great. For example, there are four weapon types, each with 5 ish bullet types. You can customise the barrel, which is good, but some are useless. You can customise the stock, which is also good, but all of them, for the rifle-ish guns anyway, are useless. You literally can buy an aluminium stock that makes you gun WORSE. Ammo cap isn't really needed, as the amount of ammo held is sufficient. You buy upgrades with money, wich comes in too slowly for you to easily find a gun style that fits you, as when you buy an upgrade it only applies to that weapon type, eg Fire shot on a pulse rifle is good, but you will need another 3k to buy a fire shot for the beam. Any customise character options are bought with real money, and untill you give the audience a reason to buy them, no one will. What else, What else, the controls are a bit finicky, but could be getting use to. The extraction gamemode is stupid, needs more challenge in it. The PvP is kinda difficult, as most players are use to fighting bots, with is more fun anyway (for me).\nEnough negatives though\n\nLoadout is free. Yay\nGreat aesthetics,I like them, though a little crude.\nGore and death is made always nice to see, so dying is fun. Yeah, I know, wierd\n\nHmmm, blah blah blah, make upgrades a bit easier to get, so you can form your own playstyle, as the skill tree makes upgrading said weapons your true goal. Yeah, a skill tree, in an online game. Expensive and stupid. You can buy and upgraded anything from mini turrets to heal grenades, but WHY BOTHER? Wierd, but you know...\n\nPersonally, It needs work, lots of it. But you can wear a pixelated ♥♥♥♥♥, so thats amazing, if you want to pay for it.\n\nConcluding le rant, play this game. Try it, its free. My only wish is that it gets BETTER.\n(Steam, make a 'Meh' recommend option pls)","February 1, 2014","false","4.1"," 98 of 189 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","98","189","0","3"

I don't think it's "billions" of combinations but millions might be a better estimate. I've made downright stupid and ineffective weapons and absolutely devastating and rediculous things that just shouldn't exist, but the balancing between weapons parts are pretty well done given the potential there was for overpowered weapons. Every part you change or add has strengths and weaknesses that favor different playstyles. I single barreled rocket launcher that just explodes is a good basic thing to start with if you just want to get into a fight with some reliable damage dealing, but an 8 barreled rocket launcher that can fire all 8 shots at once that stick to the ground as mine and explode in proximity to anyone who gets close to them into a shower of electric flak would be perfect for a capture point match where you need to force shield using players off the point quick and easy.\n\nThe game also has a very effective movement system that they should advertise as much as the guns, with a simple roll and jump you can work your way on top of nearly any structure in the game for a better vantage point, as well as make yourself a hard to kill target in modes like Death Snatch (kill confirmed) and Jack Hammer (CTF with a flag you can KILL PEOPLE WITH for more points)\n\nNow as I hear a lot of people complain about when a new F2P game comes out, is it Pay to Win?\nNo.\nI don't even have to go into further detail. No, it isn't pay to win.\n\nALSO PROTIP: IF YOU'RE ON FIRE, ROLL TO DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU'RE ON FIRE. DON'T JUST RUN AROUND LIKE A HEADLESS CHICKEN AS YOUR HEALTH MELTS IF YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.\n\nSo why should you be playing Loadout?\n\nBECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE STOP PLAYING DOTA YOU FAGGZ GIVE THIS GAME A CHANCE I DON'T WANT ANOTHER SMNC INCIDENT I DON'T WANT A DED GAEM AGAIN WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH :__;","January 31, 2014","true","47.2"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","16"

It's full of immature crude humor so if that's your thing, try it out.","June 7, 2014","true","70.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The cartoony animation of the game combined with the creativity of maps, weapon design, purposefully over-the-top gore, and character cosmetics come together to create a fun and casual FPS to play with many other people. Creative variations of generic gamemodes such as Jackhammer (CTF) and many mini-control points instead of just three main ones provide a nice change from generic FPS game types.\n\nDefinitely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a casual FPS they can experiment and have fun with, as well as play together with groups of friends.

It's emphasis on making your own weapons and using them in battle is something different and rather entertaining. However, an issue I have seen so far with the game is the impossibility for me to join a PvP game, although I can join PvB game.

A fast-paced third person shooter sort of in the same vein as TF2.....SORT OF.\n\nThe gameplay is just some fast paced mindless killing, kill the other team with 4 different types of guns and a huge amount of upgrades. The gun customisation is where this game excels. There is a lot of different parts to put onto the different types of guns you can have to suit your playstyle, whether you prefer to run in guns blazing with a mini-gun esque machine gun, or you prefer to stand further back and pick of enemies with a short burst rifle style laser gun....its all available with the expansive gun customisation!\n\nI liked the humor in this game too, 3 different characters to choose from and like i said before its got that Team Fortress 2 style of humor and a similar art style. The game is free to play which is a plus and there is no pay to win additions to the game, all the gun upgrades are free!\n\nHowever. There was a few things that the game couldve done better. The character customisation is where this game falls short. Don't get me wrong there is a good variety of clothing for characters but it is all really expensive. Now i know this is how the game has to make its money but even TF2 lets you unlock hats or character customisation pieces over time....this doesnt and it ends up with 8 guys all running about as the rambo esque guy. Plus everybody feels the same, again compare it to Team Fortress, all the characters in that game have depth and are all very different but in this its a skin slapped on the same character.\n\nOverall for what Loadout is, it's not a bad game. It's fun, addictive and can kill a good few hours mowing down people with the assortment of weapons and pieces you can add to it. But these flaws kind of make the game fall short and really just make you wish you were playing TF2. 6/10","April 30, 2014","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The bots use completed weapons regardless of levels so it's much easier (and fun!) to start off playing against people with the same experience and weapons as yourself at first.\nOther than that, no real issues.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GerDeathstar/recommended/208090/","GerDeathstar","Deathstar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GerDeathstar/","407 products in account","Loadout - Now this is how to Free-2-Play. In this brainchild of Team Fortress 2 with hints of Borderlands, two teams of four players each are pitted against each other in several different gamemodes.\n\nThe name of the game here is customisation, while you can only choose from three different playermodels, each one can be customised with a plethora of clothing-items and accessories to make him or her stand out. More noticably though are the options for customising your weapons. Apart from the very basic assault rifle you get given at the start, you can unlock dozens of new gun parts through playing the game and researching them down a tech tree. Pretty much any kind of weapons you can think of can somehow be recreated through weapon-crafting. The main inspiration here can be Team Fortress 2, as handheld rocket launchers or a healing beam-weapon can easily be made, but the options exceed this by far. Want to make a mortar that shoots flaming clusterbombs? Go ahead. A sniper rifle shooting electric beams? No problem, once you have the parts for it.\nVery big props go out to the developers for not messing up their Free-2-Play model here, all of the things you need for weapon-crafting can not be purchased through microtransactions, they must be earned by actually playing the game. This game's premium currency is solely used for the cosmetic aspects. The only downside here is that, while you can earn clothing-items occasionally, they are very rare, so your character will end up looking fairly bland and generic until much later, unless you spend real money on it.\n\nNow, with all the options for different weapons there are of course quite a few combinations that do not make sense or are just not viable on the battlefield. You can come up with some extremely situational boomsticks and still find yourself outmatched by a boring beam-sniper. It is completely up to you, however, so you can find the combination that best suits your personal playstyle.\nThe game is still not finished, so some features are not yet implemented. This means that for those who love variety, not much is offered after playing a few rounds and testing out some of the guns. The game seems to lose its novelty-value fairly quickly right now. But hey, it's completely free to play, full of humour and the microtransactions, as of now, will not allow anyone to get unfair advantages over those who won't pay. Definitely worth at least a look.","February 13, 2014","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Starting with the wide array of customizations, especially with guns(which none of them will need real currency). Using Blutes, which are research points for guns and Spacebux, which are wardrobe and purely aesthetic. The gameplay is phenomenal, with a challenging community and a few maps and gamemodes. Even bots are challenging! The guns are organized and balanced. There is that comic relief and uniqueness to this third-person shooter. However, a couple of minor bugs does de-rank this game, other than that it's a superb game that's gameplay is flawless.\n\n[Note: I am not judging the launch day malfunction with servers, because of how quickly they managed to get playtime in]\n\nFinal Conclusion: It is a raw, vulgar, and gorey game that includes great customization and solid gameplay\n","February 2, 2014","true","20.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The game boasts weapon customization as its selling point. As you play and level up you unlock new gun parts, very much in the vein of Blacklight: Retribution and customize your base weapon. The game play feels somewhere between TF2 and COD with a hint of old arena shooters. Animations are fluid and game play is smooth although a bit limited feeling as you run forward, shoot, and dodge. Death animations are probably the most interesting part of this game for me. Being able to control my legs running around after my upper body has been blown off is pretty entertaining. Definitely an interesting new shooter.

In Loadout, the only things real-world money can do is purchase avatar outfits and icons, and increase your experience by 2x for a limited time.  Everything else must be earned by playing the game. In other words, you'll advance faster simply by being good at the game, not because you have a fat wallet.\n\nThat said, I've been having a surprisingly good time playing Loadout.  Gameplay is fast and fluid; combine this with the art style and the game reminds me somewhat of Team Fortress 2.  The violence is over-the-top, to the point where dying and watching others die is actually refreshing and funny at times.\n\nAfter about three hours of playing, I've donated $10 to the devs (yes, I purchased outfits for my dude) because this game made me laugh and is fun to play - I have yet to get annoyed by any gameplay mechanics or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off that I was royally pwned by someone who paid their way to the top (again, that's not possible here).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KingoSlice/recommended/208090/","KingoSlice","HanzoSlice  #FeelTheBjörn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KingoSlice/","206 products in account","This game is a breath of fresh air to an over-saturated marketbase.  I looked at the steam page and read up on the game and thought to myself, "sure..  every game says they are completely customizable and offer a ton of unique options to make your character truly unique...but then you get in the game and there's always one or two combinations that beat anything you could possible choose to make yourself unique, so it isn't even worth it."  But this game does the customization right, and, while "billions" of possibilities is quite a stretch(at least as it currently stands), it does offer quite a bit.  I haven't seen the same one gun on any character yet - at least not that I've noticed.  They allow you to custom-choose each piece that makes up the gun, such as the stock, ammo, how the ammo projects through the air, the element of the ammo, the barrel, the scope, the size/efficiency of the magazine...pretty much anything you'd want.  The best part about it is that literally any combination will work together!\n\nI also enjoy their spiced-up versions of classic shooter game modes, such as capture the flag and standard deathmatch.  In deathmatch, the objective is the kill your opponent AND collect the vial of "blutonium" that their character drops.  The important part is to actually get to the vial of blutonium and pick it up before one of the opposing team players does(this is called a "denial").  If you aren't able to pick it up, you just missed a chance to score the core points of the game for your team(the twist is that killing doesn't rack the points up - the vial collection does).\n\nIn capture the flag, the flag is actually a big ♥♥♥ hammer that can kill opposing players in 1 big hit.  The catch is that the hammer only has 5 charges to perform hits during your run with it, but if you manage to kill opposing players during your run back, the hammer takes that number of kills and respectively ups the score your team receives when you manage to bring the hammer back to your base.  I think adding that one little aspect(the flag is actually a weapon in-and-of itself) is a neat little twist to an old fan favorite.\n\nAll-in-all, this game is definitely worth a buy for any shooting game fanatic.  If you're on the edge, all I have to say is:  it's a minimum of $10 - get it!  These devs obviously know what they're doing, and they need your help in this early access stage to get the word out and release more content!  If you're happy with the game, go back to their store and purchase the starter or founders packs that will further help the dev team!","January 8, 2014","true","35.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After the very succesfull Team Fortress 2, alot of companies tried to repeat that succes by making clones... none succeeded. This game however has the potential to trow TF2 in the garbagebin.\nIt has very fitting graphics, a few different gamemodes, a nice amount of maps, alot of cosmetic stuff and a third-person view instead of first-person. One thing i cannot express in text or show you in a video is fun .. the game is just fun to play and every second is enjoyable. Also a big feature of the game.. weaponcustomisation. You can actually make your own guns from a massive pool of parts and chassis ..  and even paint/customise the appearance of the gun (within a few patches).\nDid i also mention it will be f2p when in open beta and when released? .. well.. it will be f2p!","July 3, 2013","true","76.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

LEts change that shall we?\n\nFirst off, graphics wise. To put it bluntly it's a beautiful game. The maps render beautifully, the character models are somewhat interesting, the guns diverse in appearance. In the first case the maps are all really well done, from brush work to textures, light levels to paths it all looks rather stunning when you arrive the first time. Definitely gotta give props to whoever did the art for this game. The character models are like what you see in the vids, they're quirky, obscene and generally jiggle all over the place. With ten players all on screen blowing the hell out of each other I didn't notice any graphical slow downs with everything maxed. The guns, the biggest selling point, is where things tend to get a bit weak sauce. Yes in the customization screen they look hugely diverse but in gameplay you're never really going to notice anything other than the varied projectiles. So yeah 'customize' your gun to look however you want....nobody but you is really going to notice it.\n\nGameplay wise, it's simply chaotic fun. Between body parts being blown off to ingrained flip offs and crazy stage dives the CTF (or hammer in this case), team deathmatch and 'Bounty' game modes all fill their various niches. Capture the Hammer adds the most unique element in being able to smash opposing players to a pulp with your 'flag'. The one drawback however as I learned the hard way, you can only do this hammer kill 4 times before you are left unable to do anything. So why do it at all? Every kill you get with the hammer increases its worth so even if you're behind on scores, get four kills and then cap and you can well re-even the playing field.  The gun mechanics are again the biggest selling point but also the weak link. Like most FPS's, Loadout suffers from 'If it goes boom you win'. Bullets, energy, beams. All pale in the raw destructive force of explosive rockets. With a few upgrades I turned my already strong rocket launcher build into a one hit death gun. And I didn't even need to put the explosives on guidance or manual explosion to start dominating matches. In short: Rockets = win. They might reload slow but with the variety of movement controls you can easily dodge around while doing so to unleash explosive hell.\n\nNow the tricky element: F2P. The model revolves around paying for cosmetics. There's no pay 2 win here....Unlike most f2p models its also not pay 4 advantage either. You might get an xp booster that lets you level a little faster but it doesn't affect gameplay. However if you want to customize your digital you to look as freaky or bad@$$ as possible...expect to pay. All the cosmetics are locked behind the real money currency and thus far I haven't seen an in game way of earning any amounts of it. The in game currency of Blutes are what you use to unlock your gun parts.  Sadly the pricing skew is somewhat...unique. For several guns expect to see upgrades cost your upwards of 4k+ blutes EACH. While others of the same tier cost less than 1k. And once unlocked to get the full juice out of them they have to be played with and levelled up.\n\nIn short is it a good game or a bad game?\n\nTo answer bluntly its not bad. If you like blowing things up its great mindless fun. The weapon part leveling system will likely get tedious fast and those that stick with it will undoubtedly have an advantage over those that join fresh in a few weeks. If you enjoy that then play this now. If you came for the vast customization shown in the videos expect to be disappointed unless you're ready to drop some money, between earning enough blutes to access the 'billions of weapon options' or dropping real cash to make the three models look more than default the initial experience is going to get repetative really quickly.","February 1, 2014","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can not get an advantage by purchasing weapons. All weapons are earned by playing in matches. The costs to unlockand upgrade weapons is reasonable and forces a certain level of specialization. However,  you can test it before you unclock it to make sure you are getting what you want.\n\nThe one weakness this game does have is that while there are dozens of viable options for this game "damage" done seems to be a critical stat. This is some what mittigated by certain game modes that require people to group up to cap flags and get points. However, the game is going to need some addtional content as right now it feels a little vanilla.\n\nYou can unlock new costumes for your charecter with real money, but right now the cost is too high and I don't see myself buying anything.\n\nOverall the game feels like variation of TF2 combat with a little bit of WTF was that?","February 3, 2014","true","58.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes, it's fun, yes it has over-the-top wacky gore effects, ridiculous animations and what not, but most of the humor is crude.\nAt the core, this is still a fun team-based shooter for getting in and shooting people without overly concerning yourself with specifics.\n\nThe vaunted weapon customization doesn't quite strike me as being -exceptionally- creative. It's essentially a switch-your-6-parts-to-taste system, it's not like you can create the Particle Accelerator from Turok: Dinosaur Hunter with an underslung beam rifle.\nMost of the attachments sound rather run of the mill, and I can't seem to find an option to recolor my weapons. But if you were satisfied with Dead Space 3's weapon crafting, you will likely be satisfied with Loadout's.\nOf course, the game is still fresh out and the developers are clearly active, so maybe we'll be seeing the really crazy stuff eventually.\n\nGraphically it follows Team Fortress' look and runs very well, but with the few servers available you might have trouble getting smooth gameplay. Especially because it seems like the game runs on a P2P netcode.\n\nFor a free game, yes, it's recommendable. It's just not special to me.","February 3, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The mechanics of customizing your gun by unlocking different parts, while offering interesting characters, fun maps, and an exciting, fresh playing-style is more than I could ask for in a game right now.\n\nHowever, the economic aspect is poorly done, and turns me off a bit from the game entirely. In-game, there are two forms of currency, the one you earn by playing, and the one you purchase with real money. This, right here, is an outdated method of an in-game economy that makes me a little sad. Do you know why Korean MMO's make so much money? Do you know why Candy Crush makes so much money? Because you don't HAVE to spend money to unlock anything. It's there to buy if you want it, which is awesome! Loadout however, makes you spend money to take the happy-trail off of a character. Minuscule non-game-changing waste of a mechanic, right?\n\nIt is free-to-play, which is awesome, and I wouldn't mind supporting the game by paying money in the slightest. In fact, I desperately want to support this game. But I don't have $20 to spend on the starter pack, and I refuse to support an outdated, frustrating, and forced form of a digital economy. Please developers, do what's best for the players, and I promise they will flock even more openly to you.\n","February 1, 2014","true","19.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
