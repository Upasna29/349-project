Part sim, part game.  You control a submersible, a small roving camera, and claws on each.  The game part involves accomplishing certain goals each day before your battery and oxygen levels run out.  There are 5 days in the story mode, then it looks like you get a free-explore mode.\n\nThe good:  They did an excellent job reproducing the Titanic and you get decent touristy lectures from time to time highlighting points of interest.\nThe bad:  The one voice in the game is your navigator and he sounds like Tommy Wiseau.  Thick accent, strange cadence.  And when you navigate it's only with him telling you a cardinal direction or up and down.  He's not familiar with "northwest" I guess.  This makes finding your objectives frustrating, given the time limits involved.  The jerk won't even give you distances.\n\nIf you do play, save regularly, so you can restart a day that goes badly or so you can recover from an occasional crash.\n\nNo manual.

It just crashes most of the time when i try to start it..\n\nBut from what i've seen from it then this game the times it choses to work is not at all far from the regular Simulator games that we see so often (The farming simulator, ship simulator yada yada). And for a game of this type that focuses alot on exploration and realism of a famus shipwreck then you must really focus more into Details and really give you the wanting to continue exploring (Like different furniture in rooms or the water particle effects around you. You also need to focus to make textures on things look really detailed and good, and even for game engines and such existing in 2010 then this looks at most part really hidius (The sub looks rather alright but the game doesn't really focus on the sub now does it?) Not to mention its price tag of 20 Euro!\n\nJust keep away from this game, unlike the other simulators, this one offers no funny gags in horrible physics or funny bugs, its just pure bad looking boredom.","May 29, 2014","false","0.1"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","0"

I was curious what wouderous sights I would behold.  Maybe some plates, some chairs, some tables.. maybe I'd even see the Jewel of the Sea... (was the Jewel of the Sea real.. was it really on the Titanic.. dang you James Cameron)  Heck I would have been happy to see Jack's skeleton down there..\n\nWait this game isn't the sequel to Titanic....  wow hold on a second, I need to readjust my review.. I was under the impression this was Titanic 2, sink harder..\n\n(inhale)\n\nIn all honesty I don't know what this game is about, the controls are totally and utterly broken, and because of the broken controls I was unable to get past the tutorial... trying to teach me how to use the submarine..  I've been gaming close to 18 years and this is one of the few games that were so broken I couldn't even get past the tutorial..\n\nThankfully I only spent about 2 dollars for this game..  So not much was lost, but if you see this game sitting there.. asking you to buy it... take my advice friend...  steer as far away as possible.\n\nI suppose if the developer ever decides to go back into the game and fix the broken controlls I'll hop back in and alter my review, until then, save your money and watch some of the free Titanic exploration videos on youtube..  Not only will you save 10 bucks, but you'll have alot more fun than this game probably would have offered you anyway....\n\nI'm king of the world!!!!\n\nTo sum it up, you'd be better off spending your money buying anything else other than this game..","December 2, 2015","false","0.2"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","71","24","34","9","0"

A fairly difficult game, it becomes more so with each dive. You will become familiar with the parts of the wreck in play and how to pick your way around debris. The game resembles a real dive: long periods of boredom punctuated by moments of terror and triumph. There’s more (or less) to see than you might expect; graphics, while dated, are effective. You must install DirectX 9.0c even if you have newer versions; later DirectX versions do not replace earlier ones. Some report needing to replace their version of Quick Time; an installed is provided. There are no add-ons, patches or updates. I use a modest older laptop with good results. Game specifications are at the end.\nExpect to re-map the keyboard; key assignments are often wrong . Don’t immediately change the navigating, camera or claw operating keys or the tutorials in the first two dives will not sense the correct keys. Do any initial key re-mapping such as the number keys from ‘Settings’ in the main menu and fine-tune them later in the game after the tutorial by pressing ‘ESC’ for the menu; you can also use this menu to save a dive in progress. Check all the keys (use the ‘DOWN’ arrow to get to the later pages; click on the key’s assigned value and press the one you want instead. The left mouse button (button 0) does what you expect: in the sub and ROV outside views, click the right mouse button (button 1) then move the mouse to change the view.\nThere are five dives leading to a free-roam exploration scenario, and three levels of play:\no	Easy: for familiarization with the game. A grey visual cue shows the direction and distance in meters to the objectives, in order. There is extra time to look around. Use TAB to pause the game when needed.\no	Normal: no visual cues, the battery charge and your range are reduced, so time is more limited. You will need to know where you’re going, how to get there, and what you’re looking for.\no	Difficult: for experienced players. Operational parameters (battery, range etc.) are more critical; you have little time to spare.\nAt the Easy level, just follow the cues. Except on the last dive, you have some extra time to use to explore as you go. At the advanced levels you must plan your dives with increasing care so you know what you’re looking for, where it is, and how to get there. The map will help, but not everything is shown. Deck plans from the Internet help, but some game locations, especially cabins, don’t match the real thing. At the Difficult level you probably stand no chance without having a few practice runs behind you.\nFor a retailed step-by-step, see http://168.156.125.36/titanic.html\n","May 1, 2015","true","181.1"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","0"

Since I was a child I have always been fascinated by the wreck of the Titanic, so the chance to explore it virtually was very appealing.  Sims are not usually a genre I invest too much time in, but I hoped that the control scheme would be simplified enough to get to the real meat of the game, exploring the wreck.  Unfortunately, while the game does have some nice graphics the control scheme is absolutely deplorable, and quite frankly one of the worst release day implementations I have seen.  The tutorial directs you to push specific keys in order to move the ship back and forth, but these keys do not actually work, as though the keymap is mis-aligned and pushing all the correct characters to another location on the keyboard.  Making matters worse, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to which keys have this issue and which keys legitimately work.  In short,  I was unable to even discover the Titanic wreck.

The 'game' is not a game; it is a simulator. When you get the game and play the game, beleive me, it is about the most annoying thing you have ever endured. You will experience a weird guy with an unidentified accent telling you what to do about every 8 and 1/3 seconds, you'll know what I mean when you hear it. I'd personally like to punch the guy upwards on the nose. The payoff is that, when it ends, there are so many nooks and crannies that you can explore at your leisure. Mind you, there are plenty. Seriously it's a fun simulator once you get past the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. There are plenty of places to find; keep exploring.","May 26","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
