"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/recommended/434010/","erbkaiser","Erbkaiser ♔","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/","4510 products in account","Wishmaster is one of the strangest match 3 games I've ever played.\n\nThe mechanics are simple: you can freely move any two tiles in 8 directions (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) but the total number of moves you have per board is limited. The board has 10 rows of tiles each of which contain a stack, the goal is to clear them all out.\nWhere the game is weird, is that instead of using gems or stars, this game uses anime portraits as tiles. As a result the board looks very busy and it's pretty difficult to see possible matches. At least there's no time limit.\nThe main problem is that you only have three lives, and each time you cannot solve a board you lose one of them. Losing all your lives means starting over.\nThere is a framework story here told in broken English that really doesn't make a lot of sense, and frustratingly you have to click through it every time you lose all your lives and start over.\n\nThe combination of limited moves, a visually very busy and distracting board, as well as the very limited lives/retries does not play well with the inherent randomness that comes with match 3 games. I cannot recommend this as there are so many match 3 games that are more fun to play on Steam.","April 9","false","4.1"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","0"

Sometimes the dialogue is a bit difficult to understand as a result. There isn't that much dialogue though. Mostly this is just a match 3 game with a hilarious premise.\n\nThere are no powerups or abilities, hints or shuffles. But, you are not required to make a match with every turn. Every level gains more and more orbs. I've only run out of turns once. But because of how the rows can be emptied, I have lost multiple times because the final matches were not in a perfect row. It isn't hard apart from that bit. You can gain multiple lives (I'm not sure how exactly? I just noticed I gained them) so it isn't an immediate game over.\n\nOverall, not bad for the price. I like what I've seen so far of the plot, and it isn't a bad match 3.","January 22","true","10.8"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","22","25","2","0"

It is possible to complete the same level with every move creating a match, and in one instance have more than a dozen moves remaining, while in another having dozens of tiles remaining when you run out of moves.\n\nThere are two main factors that determine success, and neither is within your control. The first is matches caused by falling tiles as you clear the board. As you do not know what tiles will fall, you cannot predict what matches will occur. You may get no matches, a few matches, or even 10+ matches from failling tiles. The second is where the falling tiles get added. Sometimes they are added to existing columns, but often enough they create entirely new columns, which greatly increase the number of moves required to clear the board.\n\nThe premise is simple enough: you are shown a series of wishes that people want granted. Each person who wants a wish granted is represented by tiles on the board, which you match to clear the board. When you clear the board you pick one of those wishes to be granted. You are then given an anime portrait depicting the wish being granted, and a few lines of text of the character's reaction. According to the game's story, after 10 wishes your character will die. You are only given three lives with which to grant these 10 wishes, and it's possible to lose them all on the first level with a bit of bad luck.\n\nThe gameplay gets repetitve pretty quickly, especially when you have to start over and grant the same wishes again and again. Not that granting wishes is particularly exciting to begin with, a portrait and a few lines of text is hardly worth the effort to clear the board, even on the first level. The music is limited but okay, the sound effects aren't great. The writing is sparse and has a fair few translation errors. Options are basically non-existant; you cannot set your resolution, or change the volume of the music/sound effects, though you can mute them. You can choose between windowed and full-screen, and that's about it.\n\nThere are better match 3 games on Steam, there isn't much reason to play this one unless you are really, really into the genre or really, really into anime. Even then I would be hard pressed to recommend this game.","January 27","false","10.8"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","0"
