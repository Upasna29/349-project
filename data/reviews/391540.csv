How many times have you defeated a miniboss, only to have it stand back up and laugh at you, saying “I have underestimated you! You are a worthy opponent! This is not the end! We shall meet again!” and make a getaway? Think about it. How many times do you beat up Balrog in Cave Story only to have him fly away without a scratch? How is Black Knight able to keep running away after Shovel Knight stabs the hell out of him? How come you black out if you lose a Pokémon battle, but none of the other trainers do? And how does the big bad villain always seem to get away, even if their HP hits zero, so they can reappear in the sequel?\n\nUndertale asks the question, “What if defeating an enemy in battle always means that they die?”\n\nThis might seem quite inconsequential in random encounters, but Undertale will also pit you against several main characters. If you defeat a main character in battle, they’re dead for good, and the whole story changes to reflect it. Heavy stuff.\n\nBut thankfully, as the game advertises, you don’t actually have to kill anyone! The game offers a second option to get out of battles: talking the enemy out of fighting. This involves solving a simple puzzle, almost always involving the “Act” menu in battle. The puzzle changes depending on what kind of enemy you’re fighting; sometimes you’ll just need to give them a compliment, other times you’ll need to survive several of their attacks, and so on. Once they’re not emotionally invested in the battle anymore, you can “spare” them, and the battle ends. You won’t get any EXP for it, but you’ll still get gold. It’s a very unique fighting mechanic!\n\nI admit, after my first playthrough of the game, I was disappointed in the story’s presentation. I thought that both the very beginning and the final area of the game were fantastic, dripping with shocking emotional dilemmas, but the middle 80% of the game’s content seemed like it relied too much on oddball humor and not much else. The game hilariously plays with expectations and has no shortage of genuinely witty satire of its genre, and I found myself amused by nearly all of it, but after the first two hours as I was walking across long linear worlds and listening to dozens of characters try to tell me jokes, I started to wonder where the emotional gravity had gone. “Why is this game making me laugh, when I thought it was supposed to make me cry?” I asked myself. “Where are the feelings? After such an excellent and powerful prologue, why is the game taking so long to show me more?”\n\nLater that night, as I was lying awake in bed, the answer hit me: the game was quirky and lighthearted because I was sparing everyone’s life. I wasn’t playing as a murderer. If you want this game to have drama, you have to cause it. And I think that’s where all the hype is coming from, all the talk about player choice. This is a game about being a tree-hugging pacifist, or a murderous psychopath who kills anyone who gets in the way, or anything in between. You only need to live with whomever you decide to be, because the game won’t let you ignore what you have done.\n\nThough it isn’t the most visually impressive game, and the stage design isn’t always the best, Undertale has left me feeling that I have just witnessed a work of art. It tried some new and ambitious things and isn’t ashamed of what it wanted to be. It's about 6 hours long; I’d recommend anyone to play it at least twice, just to be able to say that they've made their own choices and seen what the game has to offer. It’s hard to imagine that anyone would regret the experience.","October 3, 2015","true","11.7"," 9,531 of 10,192 people (94%) found this review helpful 733 people found this review funny","94","531","10","733","131"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mexicanriceballs/recommended/391540/","mexicanriceballs","Mexi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mexicanriceballs/","81 products in account","Ten dollars. Only a few hours of gameplay. 16-bit graphics compared to the flashy 1080p stuff in standard games.\n\nBut... wow. Undertale blew me away. It doesn't need flashy graphics or even fanservice to falsify its enjoyment. It just does things right, and boy that was one immensely enjoyable experience.\n\nI think most of the magic of this game comes from knowing absolutely nothing about it. I got this game from a friend and just decided to play it since it looked very interesting and it was getting good responses. So I went in completely blind, knowing nothing but the game's name. And I'm glad I did, because everything the game presented to me was unexpected, notably dark in places, and very emotional, which would have been lost entirely if i watched someone else play it. So, if you happened to have been flooded by everything Undertale on tumblr (god help us) and the entire story's already laid out for you, the magic has been lost and the game won't be as incredible of an experience. I'm sorry.\n\nOf course, I call Undertale an "experience", not a game, only because it does such a fantastic job at it. Following the motto on the store page, "the game where you don't have to destroy anyone", the game always tries to nudge you in that direction, taking a back seat in your mind and reminding you to "Spare them!". And of course, you answer with "Why? Why should I do that when it offers me the option to kill anyone I want right in front of me? What's in it for me?" And that's where the game literally turns into a personal experience, as everyone has a different response for the game's selling point. And boy, does it turn to black or white pretty fast from here.\n\nUndertale's ability to completely turn the tables of its story depending on your actions is massive. Upon your game's startup, every little thing you do will be set in stone in the game's story pathing. If you're the type who immerses yourself into the game's charming music, laughs at the childish but hiliarious anctics, and is willing to hork down healing items just to prevent yourself from killing a monster just because a fight is difficult, the game rewards you. It opens up a very character-developing and world-unfolding story, along with some of the most emotionally invested boss battles I have ever experienced. You know a game is good when it breaks the fourth wall so well that you're shaking in your seat in true fear and can't stop the shivers, all while having to fight a hopelessly overpowered god of a boss. The amazing writing only starts once you beat the final few bosses, and the story doesn't stop being good from there onwards.\n\nOn the other hand, what makes this game different is that it keeps its dark side from you, and its entirely your choice to experience it. If you scoff at the game's sparing choice since you're too cool or grown up to possibly be nice to people, you can go around and intentionally sink your weapon into a monster who just wants to be a friend. And unlike many other games, this isn't just a simple "Oops, I killed another unnamed enemy, let's reset the game and nothing changes" moment... the weight of a dark choice is huge. It forever changes your playthrough. Reset the game, and the characters know. Events change. And with each curious kill, you, in turn, turn from the only human in a land of monsters into the biggest monster in a land of innocents. In the end, ignoring what Undertale sets out to do, which is to let you experience childlike innocence and fun, only makes it delibrately change the game into a quieter, more grim story. Very little character development, and the world isn't explained to you, nothing. There's very little reward for going through this route. Yet it is a choice you can do. Granted, you get two of the hardest boss battles by becoming the murderer and will be forced into Game Overs repeatedly from them, but even that is a message from the game... It's trying to stop you from getting to the end of this route. Before its too late.\n\nIt's as if you're doing deeds in an actual living, breathing world. And that's what makes it even more terrifying when you decide to become a murderer instead of a savior, because only you know that you're willingly going forward to obliterate every weakling in front of you. It's a test of your willpower, and it's your choice. The worst thing? The damage cannot be repaired. Go clean, or go home tainted. The game even gives you the choice to completely delete everyone's happiness after the most satisfying happy ending. The happiness you worked so hard to earn. And you can even become the murderer after saving the world, which will only permanently taint your game and never let you have a satisfying ending again. That's absolutely brutal, and yet that's still a choice. Amazing.\n\nYes, this game might not be for everyone. The humour may become dry after a while for some people, and tons of gamers nowadays like to bash at popular games instead of trying it out, just because they feel accomplished by doing it. But, if like me, you are willing to experience why everyone's been talking about this game, give it a shot. Hell, even if you hate the game to bits and want to kill everyone, buy the game, do so, and at least have your own personal experience before refunding it. This game does the morality concept so well that other games can only dream of doing the same, and it is one not to be forgotten.\n\nIt is a sin to call Undertale a game. Doing that would categorize Undertale into the bland and consequence-free "kill-em-all" genres that a lot of games are falling into now.\n\nUndertale is a story-driven, emotional experience.","November 10, 2015","true","15.3"," 5,713 of 6,220 people (92%) found this review helpful 413 people found this review funny","92","713","6","413","48"

This is my Game of the Year. What.\n\nAfter becoming ULTRA-JADED about gaming with the cancellation of Silent Hills, this game re-established that games can be really, really frickin good.\n\nThis thing was made with an incredible amount of love, and it shows in every nook and cranny, every joke, every secret conversation you never thought a game dev would have thought to include. Tobyfox is the most thorough dev ever. I'm continuously impressed with how many things he thought to include in this game, and how he managed to make it all extremely fun the entire way through. You'd think you've seen everything in this game, but you haven't. There's always another amazing thing, another way to turn the genre on its head, another great joke you didn't see coming. And it stays engaging the entire time, supported by a cast of fantastic, endearing, hilarious characters. Great puzzles too, imo!\n\nIt avoids all the things about (turn-based and non) RPGs that I despise:\n-There's no grinding (unless you want to)\n-Battles are a great length and never overstayed their welcome for me\n-There's no boring menu-navigation-only-based combat (bullet dodging/timing-based stuff really spices it up, as well as bossfights always having a new, really fun gameplay twist on them!)\n-There's no unlikable/unrelatable characters that go on and on about you being the "Chosen One" or whatever\n-No plot where you gotta go to the 7 temples and find the 7 sacred whatevers and then oh wait now that you've gotten those 7 sacred whatevers, you gotta go to 4 extra places and get 4 SUPER sacred whatevers...\n-No backtracking (unless you want to! Backtracking is actually usually rewarded with more fun conversations and such.)\n-No constant equipping and unequipping items because, oh, this one is +2 Def but -3 Speed but THIS one is +3 Speed and -2 Def but THIS one is immune to fire and this one is...\n-It actually has a way more complex, useful moral than "Evil is Bad, Good is Good." Everyone has relateable motivations.\n-The writing doesn't suck like 90% of RPGs. It has a wonderful sense of humor and a simple plot that is underlaid with complex emotions.\n-Has jokes about anime, doesn't take itself seriously.\n\nI could gush about it forever. Undertale's not only made me less jaded about gaming, but also less jaded about real life. It has a strong message about empathy that stays everpresent, while somehow not being cloying about it, or shoving the message down your throat. It's simply a wonderful experience, please play this thing!!","October 7, 2015","true","13.4"," 1,674 of 1,867 people (90%) found this review helpful 174 people found this review funny","90","674","1","174","9"

This game...\n\n...It's an absolute MASTERPIECE.\n\nFor my loyal readers, do you remember my Shovel Knight craze last year?\n\nUndertale is my Shovel Knight of 2015.\n\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are a simple 8-bit style, and although it's considered "generic" because of the whole "8 bit indie game made by one guy" sort of thing, this game uses it properly. I know, that seems really weird, but it's true. If you play the game and take a certain route, the final boss WILL blow your mind with the visuals. Not much here to say, it's not what's supposed to make this game so noteworthy, but it's still acceptable nonetheless.\n\nGameplay\nUndertale is a lot like Earthbound in many ways, the most notable trait being the turn based combat and how it's portrayed. Nowadays, LOTS of games have opportunities where you can spare or kill a certain character and decide their fate. Their flaw, however, is that the said death often is just shrugged off, both in the game's world AND in real life. Undertale takes this concept and cranks it up a notch, leaving literally every single character's fate in your hands. You can go for a pacifist run and kill no one, and this is the one I would highly recommend going for if you do decide to purchase this masterpiece. There's also the neutral ending, which is the most common of the bunch but has one of the most creative final bosses I've ever seen in video games. I won't spoil much, but it will BLOW your mind, you can trust me on that. There's also the genocide run, which is incredibly difficult to pull off because of how emotionally difficult it is to actually kill this lovable cast of monsters. The combat itself is like Earthbound's, as said earlier. This being said, Undertale takes yet another step forward, adding bullet hell and platforming to the mix and blends the two perfectly, making the game far more exciting, while keeping the original RPG elements.\n\nStory\nThis is the very core of why Undertale is such an unforgettable experience. Of course, though, you shouldn't be shocked at this point, because most of the internet will agree with me on that. The cast of characters is so diverse and unique, each one having traits to make them likable or the one you'd love to kill on a genocide run. For example, you have Sans, my favorite of the bunch. He's a laid back, prankster, and easy going skeleton who has a brother named Papyrus. What Papyrus lacks in intelligence, he makes up for with a big heart for humans. You also have Flowey, who immediately will creep you out because of how ruthless he is. As for the plot itself, it's one big emotional rollercoaster you would want to ride over and over and over again. It has its hilarious moments, since the writing is surprisingly well done, while it has its sad moments, too. What takes the cake on all of this, though, is that it literally makes you rethink everything you knew about video games. The fourth wall is also broken often, and this is done in the most clever and creative ways. It's like Kid Icarus: Uprising, except Undertale does it far better. I almost forgot, too, but every action in this game will be remembered by the characters, long after you actually beat it. People have called this game a "sentient being" and I can actually agree with them on that. Trust me, Undertale is literally perfect for storytelling, and I won't be shocked if you cried a bit. It's hard not to, and with such a unique cast of lovable characters, it further justifies my point.\n\nAudio\nI have a friend who also loves Undertale, and the one thing he seems to point out about it is the soundtrack. I can't blame him, because it's really catchy. Remember how I said this game was my Shovel Knight of 2015? I wasn't kidding about that, it has the awesome soundtrack to go with it. You have Bonetrousle, the sinister, yet lighthearted and catchy tune that fits Papyrus. There's the Spider Dance, Muffet's theme. This theme is a lot more evil but far more catchy, and is one of my personal favorites. The king of the bunch, however, is one that didn't directly originate from Undertale: Megalovania. Sans' theme is slowly becoming an iconic boss theme, as it has been used in two different times in the past, and this variation is definitely my favorite of the three. You also have some humorous songs, namely the Dogsong. I won't get too in-depth with that one, but I need to say this now: GEEEET DUNKED ON! There is no voice acting, but why does that even matter? This game doesn't need it. Overall, this game has some high quality music, and I love it that way.\n\nReplayability\nAs I said earlier, this game has multiple endings. Want to know what makes it interesting, though? The characters will remember EVERYTHING you've done. I mean that, too. Mess with the game's files and try to beat it that way, I dare you. With the multiple endings, the replayability is far more dependent on you. If you have no soul, you'll probably try and do a genocide run while doing the other two runs as well. Maybe you'll try and do a pacifist one so you don't have to go through the pain of killing anyone, then do a neutral, and finish with a genocide ending. Just remember, EVERY choice will be remembered permanently.\n\nVerdict\nUndertale is easily my GotY at this point in time, but it's also one of the most creative games I've ever seen. This is an absolute masterpiece, and I really hope it wins a LOT of awards. Do I recommend this game? Well, I'll join the internet on this one and say, "Of course!" Just be ready to stock up on spaghetti, because you'll need it while you stress-eat and do a playthrough of this gem.\n\nGraphics - 8.5/10\nGameplay - 10/10\nStory - 11/10 (Yes, I'm actually serious with this)\nAudio - 10/10\nReplayability - 9.0/10\n\n**GANDHI GAMING PERSONAL PICK**\n\n.:10/10:.\n\n+Breaks the fourth wall in extremely creative ways\n+AWESOME soundtrack!\n+Emotionally powerful and also mind blowing storyline\n+Unique cast of characters\n+Morality system done perfectly\n+Adds platforming and bullet hell gameplay with turn based combat\n+Lots of hilarious moments\n+Makes you rethink everything you knew about video games","November 13, 2015","true","10.2"," 700 of 778 people (90%) found this review helpful 148 people found this review funny","90","700","778","148","8"

This is a tough one to write, not at all like my usual reviews. I'm just sort of rambling and gushing because there's so much to say about Undertale... and I can't SAY anything without spoiling the experience for you!\n\nYes, you!\n\nBuy this game, don't watch anything on YouTube about it, don't read the Undertale subreddit or any wikis, don't even read this review (though I've avoided spoilers, of course) – just seal yourself into a room with a computer and some kind of makeshift toilet, play it to completion, clean yourself for the love of God, and come back.\n\n...\n\nHero? Villain? Or something wholly other?\n\nThe year isn't out and there are some huge releases yet to come, but that being said...\n\nUndertale is a GOTY contender, indie or otherwise.\n\nIt's the best RPG in a year of amazing RPG releases.\n\nIt's the funniest, most well-written game in, well, a very long time.\n\nIt's the most genuinely heartwarming (and incredibly dark) game in, well, a very long time.\n\nIt's challenging but surmountable, given a little skill and a whole lot of determination.\n\nAnd it's also the most mind-♥♥♥♥y game in, well, a very long time, in an entirely unique way! Sure, you can compare it to Metal Gear's Psycho Mantis or Eternal Darkness' sanity meter effects, though that won't do Undertale's special, thoughtful mechanics justice.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nYou play as a tiny, gender-neutral child with bad fashion sense who falls down a mountain into a cavernous underworld filled with all sorts of fantastical monsters – all of whom have been banished there after losing a war with humankind. Now you have to get yourself back to the sunny, human-friendly overworld.\n\nFairly standard so far, complete with the pretty concept art cutscenes and humdrum hero origin tale.\n\nThen five minutes pass and all your expectations just sort of fly out the proverbial window screaming, never to return.\n\nLike, ever.\n\nThus begins your six, seven, or eight hour (initial) journey into Undertale. You'll encounter all sorts of wacky, zany characters and monsters, puzzles, traditional RPG-type environments... loaded with obstacles standing between you and the finish line. And it's up to you decide how you're going to approach the aforementioned zany characters and monsters. Sure, you can do the traditional “kill indiscriminately” thing, but that's just one solution. See, Undertale is an RPG where you can beat the whole damn thing without killing anyone!\n\nLike, you can hug your way through the entire affair!\n\nEasy enough, right?\n\nAnd you can always just reload a save if you screw up, right?\n\n…\n\nAnyhoo, combat mechanics are... it's hard to describe. It's like a traditional turn-based RPG combat system only, well, those expectations all went screaming out that window I mentioned earlier. Your heart appears in a window below the enemy you're currently dealing with and you have to dodge bullet-hell-style attacks... most of the time anyway. Even after your old expectations are but a distant memory, newly established expectations go flying out screaming too.\n\nIt's a little weird.\n\nIf fighting is your style you'll have that option, of course. Presented with a flashing bar, hit the sweet spot and you'll do the most possible damage; rinse and repeat. You can access items, check on the enemy's stats and what have you, pursue a peaceful resolution... lots of options, and every monster is a little different.\n\nWell, not a little different – incredibly different, incredible variety! And figuring out their ticks, traits, fears, and dreams is all part of the fun puzzle that is Undertale.\n\nBut there's more!\n\nUndertale's music is fabulous – in that wonderfully synthetic, retro way. Every character has a “voice,” every monster, region, and special event has a theme, and when appropriate, the music is chillingly absent. It's the best part of this game - beside the top-notch writing.\n\nI said every character has a “voice,” referring to the musical tones playing during dialogue. But they also each have their own VOICE, you understand? There's the overly protective mother, the bad jokester, the lacking-any-self-awareness fella... but even then it's just scratching the surface. These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s emote! These sprites have some Shakespearean depth that becomes more apparent with each hour, each playthrough.\n\nYou'll care for them, whether you want to or not.\n\n…\n\n\nWhat else is there to say? I laughed out loud two dozen times or so, I lost count; I nearly cried at least five times, I was God damned jumpscared more than once, I had an existential crisis, and I'd do it all over again.\n\nAnd again.\n\nAnd again.\n\nThere's, like, nothing I can even complain about! Were some of the fights tedious, long-winded? Yeah, but I might be biased because I wanted to just enjoy more dialogue, more strange interactions, more environments. Were some of the references lost on me (particularly Anime stuff)? Sure, but that's what Google is for.\n\nUndertale just is... objectively good.\n\nObjectively great.\n\nIt's an experience like Shadow of the Colossus, Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Half-Life, Red Dead Redemption, Dark Souls, EarthBound... a little, unassuming 2D RPG game released in 2015 stands shoulder to shoulder with some of the best games of all time – one I initially judged by its cover and ignored.\n\nI'm glad I deleted that particular corrupted save file and started fresh, because missing out on this game would have left a little heart-shaped void that I might have never filled.","October 19, 2015","true","16.0"," 788 of 895 people (88%) found this review helpful 150 people found this review funny","88","788","895","150","10"

I did so after being super impressed by the demo, and asking Toby if there was some way I could help out.\n\nAfter experiencing the final game, my high expectations were absolutely blown away.\n\nUndertale is a fantastic, novel, unforgettable RPG experience in so many ways.\n\n\nIt couples thoughtful, reactive NPC interactions with a very engaging bullet hell / varied minigame combat system that, unlike most rpgs, never becomes a bore or a slog. Difficulty was a gentle ramp, though affords opportunties for the player to really challenge themselves. All of the combat defenses are unique to each enemy, serving as both funny and clever expressions of their personalities.  Mechanically the combat is so solid it makes me wonder why I haven't seen it done before.\n\nUndertale ties its combat and the rest of its game systems so intricately into its narrative, into achieving what it sets out to do as an experience, that it's almost magical.\n\nThe characters are genuinely likable and relatable. I find this supremely important to stay interested in narrative-focused games and Undertale does not disappoint.  Depending on your interactions with characters, the choices you make will hit you.  Hard.\n\nAudio... Well, Toby Fox is known for doing some tremendous music tracks.  On first listen to many of Undertale's songs I said to myself 'oh yeah, I can tell this is going to become an instant classic.' The melodies and compositions are just excellent, and truly help create memorable in-game experiences. You want the soundtrack, trust me.\n\nI might consider graphics to be the 'weakest' aspect of Undertale, but I'd stress that they are utterly appropriate and support the experience.  Really the one nitpick I have is that I'd liked to have seen more NPC animations in the overworld, to make monsters feel as lively and ~sassy~ as they do in combat.  But it's a small quibble in a very, very intricate game. Ultimately Undertale's simple, cartoony, certainly Mother-esque graphic style suits it perfectly, enhancing and fortifying a very chill, friendly tone.\n\nA single playthrough is in the neighborhood of six hours, but by design Undertale encourages both replay and reeximation of choices made throughout the game.  I went through its content repeatedly, eagerly looking for new insights and interactions I had missed, and I feel like I got way more value than I could ever hope to expect for the price.\n\nGet this game, it's touching.  It's worthwhile.  It's Undertale.\n\n\nOh, and Toby?  Thanks for letting me help you.  It means a lot to me.","September 15, 2015","true","27.4"," 330 of 376 people (88%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","88","330","376","15","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Roserin/recommended/391540/","Roserin","❤Roserin❤MissTaxi❤","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Roserin/","978 products in account","Undertale, “the friendly RPG where no one has to die.” When a game makes you feel bad for killing monsters and makes you consider not killing any more, then it definitely does something right!\n\nStory\nThe story goes that both monsters and human once ruled over earth, living together, until war broke out between the two races. The humans defeated the monsters and drove them to the depths of Mt. Ebott, trapped with a magic spell. You appear on a bed of golden flowers, and are greeted by a flower, and taught about friendliness pellets. Afterwards, you can choose to massacre every monster you meet, or choose to show mercy to your opponents. Your actions of killing or mercy will shape the way the game progresses, as well as how others view you. The dialogues, and even the music of the game will become happier or distorted based on your killings or acts of mercy. With that said, there are a few endings that can be achieved within the game, some being more satisfying than others; some feeling like you are cutting onions, and some just for the cold hearted. What makes these outcomes to impactful, and sometimes sad, is the way the monsters react to the player’s actions, and sometimes questioning your actions and making you feel like a monster for the things you do. This is also true when you do immoral things like take more than one candy from a bowl of candy that says “take one please”.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay is very easy to catch on to, and is like one of those old time rpg games like Earthbound. Your goal is simple, but complex, just get through the game(through any means necessary). Your initial goal, or why you are there are not stated, but you can assume you fell down the mountain (as seen in the opening). Your real goal is to play the game as you like, exploring this unique world of monsters and see what it has to offer.  While you explore the world, you will have numerous random encounters with monsters, in which you are a heart that must avoid monster’s attacks, and will die if you take too much damage (causing you to restart at your last save). Pretty easy to understand and play, but a bit difficult to master, as some of the later encounters will be a lot more difficult to dodge seamlessly, and may prove to require a bit more thought and endurance to overcome, rather than just one lucky turn. The game itself is not too difficult, in that it does not have any difficult puzzles to do, and no grinding is required to win the game, as the game can be beaten without killing a single thing.\n\nVisuals/Audio\nThe visuals are all a bit old timey, but that does not take away from the experience. As for the audio, there are a wide variety of songs that make the game very fun while in combat scenarios. The beginning music was a bit new to me, as I did not think it would have the old retro type of music, but it surprisingly worked well and was not monotonous, and seemed to match the backdrops, and battles very well.\n\nCharacters\nWhy would I include a characters section in a review? The answer is, because they are such an integral part of the game, otherwise it would be like any other rpg, with the exception of the option to spare your opponents.  The characters are what make this game so memorable. It’s not the fact these characters are super likeable, since you may end up disliking or even hating some of them, but the fact these characters will end up growing on you in the end. Without such a unique and hilarious cast of characters, the player would not feel any real motivation to spare them, or any remorse if the player decides to kill any of them. They are in all respects to this game, the driving force that makes it so popular and why it causes many (if not all) it’s players to shed tears.\n\nVerdict: 9/10\n\nStaying determined really is the only way to beat this game!\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, please feel free to follow our curator here.","February 7","true","21.4"," 203 of 218 people (93%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","93","203","218","16","3"

When I got around to playing it, though, I went in as a skeptic; sure, a lot of people on my Steam friends list were giving it high praise, but I had doubts that it could really be THAT good. After two playthroughs (one neutral and one 100% pacifist), I can safely say that it really is THAT good. This review will probably be a bit vague, but I don't want to spoil a single important moment of the game.\n\nThat being said, this is not a game that will hook you from minute one. The game as a whole is deeply inspired by--almost a love letter to--the Earthbound/Mother series, and the opening scenes reeked a bit of trying way too hard to emulate those excellent, beloved games. Undertale takes a little while to find its own voice, and it does eventually reach the point where its unique style and charm becomes fully realized.\n\nIn particular, the game masterfully shifts gears between hilarious and heartwrenching, and wacky and reverent, sometimes in the same scene! A few jokes fall flat, of course, but this game had me smiling and laughing way more than any other game in recent (or even not-so-recent) memory. The characters are delightful, and the gags can be both groanworthy and genuinely hilarious. The more serious, emotional scenes still don't feel out of place, though--the changes in tone never feel abrupt or out of place.\n\nThe story and characterization are incredible. Just trust me on this. The only thing I'll point out here is that I love how the main character was designed. This character is androgynous and never assigned a gendered pronoun, which I think is really nice!\n\nThe music is incredible, too.\n\nGameplay of Undertale feels secondary to the plot in terms of importance, but it's still just as fantastic as the rest of the game. It's a somewhat ecclectic mix of strategy (How can I end this battle peacefully?) and bullet hell-inspired dodging sequences done in WarioWare-sized chunks. Battle encounters against each of the game's enemies are all well-crafted; boss fights are fun challenges, with most offering their own unique spin on the basic game mechanics.\n\nCalling Undertale "a labor of love" doesn't even do it justice in my mind. This project feels like something that was in developer Toby Fox's head for a long time, and he finally managed to get it out and present it to the world. You should play it. Yes, you. It's real good.","October 2, 2015","true","12.4"," 256 of 291 people (88%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","88","256","291","13","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KidsSerge/recommended/391540/","KidsSerge","Serge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KidsSerge/","294 products in account","Undertale is a game that took me by surprise and it has left an impression that will stay with me forever. It is one of those magical games that come along only so often. I loved everything about it. The music, the writing, the gameplay, the art. This is a beautiful game that has so much heart and soul. What Toby and his team have created is a classic. If you're still skeptical, please keep reading and try the demo at http://undertale.com!\n\nUndertale is a "traditional role-playing game where no one has to get hurt". If you're familiar with most any RPGs, then the basic game mechanics should feel very familiar to you. You play as a protagonist who explores a vast labyrinth, encountering monsters, engaging them in turn based combat, leveling up after gaining EXP, talking to NPCs, and solving puzzles. Despite having all these standard elements, Undertale is NOTHING like any RPG you've played before.\n\nDespite being rather short, roughly 10-13 hours for me, each moment is precious. There's so much attention to detail and you'll find surprises around every corner. The writing is brilliant, filled with humor and wit, and at the end I was hanging on every word. Each character is rich with personality and you'll remember all of them long after you've completed the game.\n\nThe combat system is very unique and is one of the first things to stand out about the game. Confrontations are a mix between classic turn-based RPG combat and "Shoot Em' Up" mini-games. Each enemy feels fresh and completely different from the next, and that's not even the half of it. Aside from attacking and defending, there's a lot of other fun actions you can explore. Most importantly, the option to refrain from fighting all together.\n\nIt's nothing new for a game to let you choose either a violent of pacifist approach, but Undertale takes the concept to a whole new level and is fundamental in what makes it so special. Despite placing you in the role of a vulnerable child lost in an underworld full of monsters, the game wants you to be comfortable, enjoy yourself, and learn to love the universe you're in. It does this so well, that by the end, the thought of hurting anyone or anything in this world will break your heart.\n\nToby Fox has single handedly risen to my top 5 game composers. He already has an impressive portfolio; you may have heard some of his earlier works from Homestuck. His range of styles and the feelings he evokes is simply astounding. The score for this game is very unique, and maintains a masterful quality all the way through.\n\nUndertale has moved me in ways that only a few others before it could. It fosters so many strong and pure emotions. It will make you laugh and it'll make you cry. It's a world you'll want to fully immerse yourself in and for only $10 it's a steal. The memories I've made with this game are worth infinitely more. Thanks for reading my review. The thought that it may have convinced even one person to play the game fills me with determination!","September 15, 2015","true","18.1"," 252 of 289 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","252","289","8","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krokorok/recommended/391540/","krokorok","sable","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krokorok/","294 products in account","One of the most heartfelt and genuine games I've ever played. Undertale is an RPG where, as advertised, you don't have to kill anyone. You play as a child who has accidentally fallen into an underground society of monsters, long since locked away after an unsuccessful war on humanity.\n\nHowever, despite an immediate declaration that this world is "kill or be killed," you are introduced to a motherly monster named Toriel who introduces you to the Ruins you have landed in, and the puzzle-based world they live in. From there, you find your own way, and decide to befriend the monsters, or whether they are deserving of your wrath, as you venture forth and find a way home.\n\nAs overly 'quirky' as the screenshots of the game may make it seems (although don't get me wrong, the game is gut-bustingly funny), Undertale's writing is top-notch. No other game has invoked so much emotion in me, in... well, ever. The game runs the gambit from heart-wrenching tragedy, to unstoppable laughter, to genuine unease, aided in part by the way the game handles YOU, as a player, and the way you interact within the world, and what sort of entity you are compared to the denizens of the underground. And on top of that, each character is unique and has a strong personality, from the bosses-turned-friends (on pacifist runs) to each and every monster you encounter.\n\nThe music is, most certainly, one of the game's strengths. Most of the game was made by Toby Fox, a musician who has composed for the popular webcomic Homestuck. Each track is crucial in setting the game's tone, and most songs will stay with you, even long after you've left the world of Undertale.\n\nI'm really bad and awkward at writing, so if there's one thing to take away from this review, it's this:\n\nThis game has exceeded all of my expectations and made me emotionally unstable.

The only way it could've been better is if it never ended.\n\nA relatively simple combat system, with an interesting dodging mechanic tied to a - at first glance - no more than easy to make art style may leave passerbys assuming this is yet another half-baked indie game, but it is so much more than that.\n\nHaving beaten one of the relatively short 10 hour playthroughs, the game had left me yearning for more. I haven't played a game that has impacted me in such a way in a long time, and even fewer games have made me feel bad for even thinking about taking the easier and shorter route.\nFrom Toriel the "goat mom" to sans and Papyrus' infamous bad jokes, Toby Fox has created memorable characters that feel more alive than just pixels on a screen. A certain flower, lesser dogs and an angry fish girl; they each react differently to your decisions and actions, which are permanent and have a lasting effect on the world you inhabit in the game. Morals are a large part of the story, and at some point, you have to make a choice.\nWhether you make a good one or a bad one, is up to you.\n\nWhatever you do - whether you have an inkling of empathy or not - play this game.

It has random battles. You gain "EXP" and Gold. It relies on lots of dialogue and nostalgiac pixel graphics to immerse you into the story. And although I have incredibly fond memories of titles like Chrono Trigger and Secret of Evermore, I am not a big fan of traditional RPGs due to heavy use of recycled content, random battles and lengthy dialogue as it's primary means of storytelling and building atmosphere. In otherwords: there's a lot of filler, a game that could be summed up in a 2 to 3 hour cinematic will instead span 30 to 40 hours of 'grinding' and 'exploration'.\n\nUndertale, however, is short and sweet. I completed the game in 3 to 4 hours, and that included a lot of 'exploration' and taking my time to read the dialogue, stopping to smell the roses (and dogs). Random battles aren't tedious because the combat gimmicks (dodging attacks and being able to mercy opponents) make it interesting enough. Upon playing the game a second time, I realized that running into the same combat encounter more than once was quite rare. Since enemies have different "bullet hell" attacks, they create some interesting combos. For instance, one monster might create a circle pattern, while the other does vertical lines. Either one of those attacks by itself isn't that tough, but together it's a little more tricky. Needless to say... I've never been bored with the combat or wanted it to "just be over with already" like I have in so many other RPGs.\n\nThe game's aesthetics are impressive as well. At a quick glance, it seems like it suffers from bland, uninspired "indie" pixel graphics meant to invoke feelings of nostalgia for gamers of the 80s and 90s. However the art style is great and subtle facial expressions make major characters really come to life. The environments and use of colors creates a very immersive atmosphere and makes certain moments a lot more emotional. The dogs are well drawn, too. I will mention however that a lot of the NPCs aren't animated, just still images with moving mouths, but it never really felt jarring or out of place - just a bit lazy. Soundtrack is great, very quirky, Earthbound soundfont is generously used here. There's even a dog song.\n\nThe real highlight of the game, however, is the incredible writing quality. I am very picky about writing in games like these, because without a good storytelling element, RPGs are just turn-based beat'em'ups. Undertale is quite the tale. The humor is on point. The characters have really vivid personalities. There are dogs. Personally, I found the story itself to be very moving. I can't say much more about that without spoiling something, so I'll leave it at that.\n\nEdit: I beat it again and saw the 'True Ending'. God damn. Changing my rating from B+ to A.\n\nOverall: A\nDefinitely worth the price ($10)","September 29, 2015","true","13.0"," 169 of 197 people (86%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","86","169","197","26","2"

Is it because we just wanna run away from reality, or be a hero in virtual world, or just need to avoid being bored? After playing undertale, maybe you’re able to answer the question: because games fill us with determination.\n\nWestern people do value personality. Their reality shows don’t sell tragic stories, but they do tell stories, just for creating personalities. There can be a cute silly little boy, a wise elder man, a warm-hearted lady, and a mean white girl in a show. Personality is the key to make audience love a person and a show. And when I started playing undertale, the strongest feeling was “what strong personalities!”. Undertale created personality for every single character or monster, and all the personalities are strong which are so memorable. I believe it’s also the main reason why it gets so many positive comments on Steam. You may see a lot of fan art pieces on Instagram and Tumblr which is really rare for an indie game. It means a lot. Strong personalities mixing with simple graphics bring an amazing chemistry. The contrast brings bigger astonishment.\n\nAfter playing games for so many years, we all have got a “pattern”: kill monsters, gain exp., level up, beat boss, end. So every time we start a new game, we just try to figure out how to attack, jump, beat enemies and what skills we will get after we up the level as soon as we can. In undertale, it seems to create the same atmosphere, and there are “EXP” and “LV” too. It tells you “EXP” stands for experience, and LV represents “LOVE”, so you have to beat monsters, gain “EXP” to rise your “LOVE”. You may meet monsters anytime, and it may be a frightened dog, a sad ghost, or a narcissistic horse. You have four choices: FIGHT, ACT, ITEM, MERCY, and in ACT, you may PET, FLIRT, TALK with monster, just like other RPG games! Your choices really mean a lot in fight, however, like the classic saying gose, you have to “stay determined”, especially when you choose MERCY, you will face a number of attack until the monster gives up fighting. Of course sparing others requires determination, dosen’t it? Sure, you can choose fight as well and kill the monster, even though it’s just an overwhelmed dog, a terrified bee. Playing so many games, we already become numb and ruthless and we don’t regard it weird to kill monsters and gain experience. That’s what we want actually, isn’t it?\n\nYou have to be responsible for your choices. In undertale, a little choice will probably result in a completely different end. At the beginning, you will meet Toriel who is gentle, patient, compassionate and lovely. She makes cinnamon pie for you, calls you to check if you’re safe, arrages a room for you... But we all know that we have to keep moving forward and leave the ivory tower she builds for us. So, we’ll start the fight with her. I had no idea how to end the fight for the first time, and I tried to spare her 2 or 3 times but it didn’t work at all. So I guessed I had no option but to kill her. My heart sank deeper and deeper when I saw her HP get lower. “Am I really about to kill her?” I felt horrible but couldn’t stop it so I just kept doing it. When my HP was 2 points, I found her attack was dodging me like a real mom by no means would hurt her child. Finally, I killed her, kept moving on sadly and was thinking about starting over again. After watching some playthrough I noticed that if I had chosen mercy for 20 times, Toriel would let me go then I could move on without killing her. Ultimately, it was all because I didn’t “stay determination”. There were so many cute characters afterwards, dream boyfriend sans, silly and cute THE GREAT PAPYRUS, brave and responsible Undyne, drama queen MTT, and really helpful professor.... The developer designed exclusive lines for every single character which made them alive and vivid. Due to the fight with Toriel, I spared PAPYRUS, gave up killing Undyne. However, it was too late, after killing Toriel, I was already in a hypocritical line. No matter what I did after that, I couldn’t reach the “true end”. In the final fight with Asgore, the developer just slapped in my face again. He told me “EX” was “Execution points” instead of experience points, LOVE represented “level of violence” instead of love itself. That moment, I had to admit it was really an excellent game and started regretting to do what I had done.\n\nUndertale is filled with irony and black humor. It makes players feel empathetic. It wrapped its simple and thin fighting mode with abundant personalities. It’s like watching a movie more than playing a game. After finishing it, players will almost love every monster and can’t wait to play it again!(spare Toriel!) Besides, the soundtrack was amazing too. It really helped us feel immersed.\n\nAnyways,\nkeep calm and stay determined.\n\n9/10","May 8","true","12.7"," 182 of 216 people (84%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","84","182","216","17","11"

Not enough for me to really be able to form my own opinion on it, but they were good things. This was two days ago. I'd messaged my friend Bread, who was playing it at the time, inquiring as to whether or not I should buy it. The reponse I got? An immediate, emphatic "BUY IT" followed by "NOW", and then "BUY IT NOW".\n\nWhy did I ask? Was I unsure about my wanting the game? No, certainly not; as a content creator myself, I make it a point to consume media, which includes different video games. And it wasn't even a money situation, though that's a good reason not to get a game of course. Thing is, I don't buy video games for myself very often. In a respectable Steam library of around 100 games, out of the ones that cost actual money, I've purchased maybe about 10% of them, if that much. So maybe you're thinking 'wow, so how do you have so many games?' Simple: my friends and followers are very generous people.\n\nI bought the game.\n\nThe art style itself didn't really appeal to me right off the bat. I mean yeah, some pretty cool art here and there, especially with pixel/binary backgrounds, but it wasn't for me. Still, a game is more than the first few panels you see and I gotta say I did warm up to it and it became a part of the general familiarity of the world. Though I wish to add that the introduction was beautifully rendered, featuring an intriguing (though admittedly not 100% 'original') story to lead off with. Plus AMAZING tunes. So yeah, I was thinking to myself, let's check this out.\n\nNow, I won't spoil what happens, even at the very, very start of the game. You can poke around social media for those kinds of details. But I will say that the start of it threw me off, and it certainly drove me to continue playing. Just learning the ropes, I thought. No biggie.\n\nYES biggie, holy ♥♥♥♥. When you read about Undertale and how it boasts an unusual RPG system, I mean, it really does. There are routes you can take, conversations you will go through, and events that transpire that will make you think. Not just like 'hm' kinda think, or whatever kind of thinking you assume I mean, but more about how actions have consequences.\n\n'But Kat,' you protest. 'I already know actions have consequences. I learned this in, like, kindergarten.'\n\nOkay, probably. You know that what you think, say, and do is part of what culminates to make your life or whatever. But hey, I'm just saying, sometimes you need a reminder, right? Sometimes, you go through ♥♥♥♥, and it makes you think. Really think. And it makes you regret some things, and laugh, basking in the nostalgia of other things, little details that will never quite escape you. Happy and sad and frustrating things you might not forget tomorrow nor five years from now. Overall this game is that ENTIRE (very fulfilling) experience.\n\nAlso, while I'm still here, I just wanted to say: You will forever be in my heart, Toriel.\n\ntl;dr: Spectacular soundtrack, lovely characters you'll get attached to, unique RPG 'battle' system, memes, approximately 25 minutes worth of tears (from myself, at least), hilarious jokes, bad fonts, generally a great time.\n\nBuy this game. Buy the soundtrack too, if you can afford it.","September 23, 2015","true","101.6"," 230 of 283 people (81%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","81","230","283","30","5"

This game honestly took me by surprise.\n\nWhen I first saw this game, I didn't really think much of it, just another generic 8-bit RPG filled with memes, so I didn't really ever consider playing it. Then, a friend of mine gifted me it, and I didn't want to be rude and put it off, so I thought 'hey why not give it a shot?'\n\nAnd so I did. Frankly I was surprised at the bullethell aspect of dodging enemy attacks in an RPG game, and I don't really mind bullet hell so I welcomed it. Boss battles are also quite unique as well. They each have their own gimmick that you have to do, IF you want to befriend them. (tip: if you want to, there is always a way to spare absolutely every enemy you encounter in the game, no matter what. You sort of have to do that on your first playthrough if you want to see the True Ending). In terms of attacks, they each put in their own unique twists in an attempt to hinder you. Frankly I really liked how all the bosses mixed it up in terms of attacks and gimmicks. Enemies are pretty interesting too\n\nIn terms of story, how should I put this? It takes a while to find its own voice, and the story seemed generic with a mild humourous twist at first. But then I got to the final few parts of the game, and the story REALLY picked up from there. VERY rarely have I ever played a game where I managed to legit feel something for the story and it's characters, and Undertale's finale did exactly just that.\n\nNPC's are also pretty unique. A lot of them I found pretty funny, although some of the attempted humour may not appeal to some people, as they may think it tried too hard. Nevertheless, almost all the NPCs are likeable and have clear distinct personalities.\n\nThe soundtrack. The soundtrack is, quite frankly, one of the best aspects of this game. I have not found one track in here that I dislike. Just about every single one I've heard, I've loved. The best ones are the boss themes, a lot of them are a mix between retro and modern. Toby pulled off this combination in an absolutely excellent way, putting this game's soundtrack in my list of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in any videogame\n\nOverall, would I reccomend it? It depends. If you don't mind bullet hell and retro style graphics, then this is definitely the game for you. If you don't like either as much, then I'm not sure if you will enjoy this game, but I still advise to try it out for the story/characters. This is definitely one of the better games I played this year, and I can't wait to see what'll happen if I do different things during different runs.\n\n10/10","October 9, 2015","true","21.2"," 110 of 122 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","110","122","3","1"

I thought I'd pick up this little indie game called Undertale and spend some time taking my mind off things. Turns out it would just make me think harder about things than I ever had before. And through this period of confusion and emotional instability, Undertale was my closest friend.\n\nI suddenly had friends and people looking out for me. It all felt so real. So real that I suddenly didn't feel so alone. These people motivated me to learn how to forgive, and go to great lengths to spare someone important to me. And even people who I didn't know. People who might seem nasty, but just need someone to talk to. Undertale taught me that no matter what someone does, or how you feel about something in the past, that it's a better option to not lash out at people and act out of aggression, but to show mercy.\n\nWhen my friend came back to say to me that she wanted to talk to me again, I remembered everything that had happened before. How bad I had felt, and how I felt the only way to feel better was to make sure we had nothing to do with each other. The day that happened, I remember my heart shattering. As if I had died. But here I was, standing here now in a situation that seemed all too familiar to me. But how was I going to act this time? In this world, second chances don't appear as often as we'd all like. So this time, I made sure to welcome her with open arms.\n\nMy friend and I made up, and I have Undertale to thank for making it clear to me that it was the right thing to do. When people fight, the solution is never to distance yourself more so that you'll hurt less. In fact, doing so will just hurt everyone a lot more. Just try and talk it out. Being a pacifist can go a long way. And who knows, you might even make a friend or two.\n\nTo those of you who might feel lonely, or bitter, or just plain unhappy, Undertale is here for you. Here to let you reflect on yourself, and maybe even some other people you might know. If you're lucky, you might even figure something out like I did.\n\nIf you need a friend, Undertale will be your friend. But, friendship won't happen unless you give each other a chance. So what will you do? Give it some thought. Wherever you are and however you're doing, I hope things end up working out for you. Until then, stay determined.","April 21","true","40.0"," 182 of 224 people (81%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","81","182","224","29","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zyga21/recommended/391540/","Zyga21","Zyga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zyga21/","435 products in account","Playtime and Time/money The game in total took me 5 hours to complete a path, after that I beat the other 2 paths clocking in at 15.1 hours. the time money value is... slightly off though, because it's far less about how much time you play this game, and far more about the fun you had while playing. But in case you still want to know, my rate for the game was 0.66 an hour, which is fairly cheap for a lot of games anyway.\nIn other words it is at a value that is worth buying.\n\nExactly what is this game? Wow, so this game... is best described as a meta game. It knows so much.without giving away any spoilers the game is an RPG with everything you'd come to expect in an RPG, stats items, dialog etc. what sets this apart is the dialog though and the mix in of bullet hell gameplay in the battle system, when you go to fight an enemy you'll be given a bar that you have to time properly to deal full damage, and when an enemy attacks you you have to dodge a unique bullet hell attack for each enemy, not only this but there are several different mechanics in the battle system that also get introduced, you'll know what these are by color eventually. And that's it as far as battles go.\n\nAs far as the story, the game has a very well thought out, well executed story, it's unique, it's lovable, it's something that truly stands out to be "this is undertale's story". You start out the story as a human who falls into the monster underworld onto a bed of flowers, and the game will guide you from there.\n\nThe game is also filled with lovable characters, I find it hard to believe anyone could go through this game without liking any of them, even on certain unmentionable runs, because all the characters have a personality unique to them, they also have realistic personalities, I could see myself in one of the characters and I could see my friends fit into several others. They are fun, are realistic (as far as monsters go for being realistic, lol) and have their own feelings on them. If you spare an enemy, they're going to be grateful, or they might hate you, who knows. If you hurt a friend, you're going to feel bad about it, in fact some might say you're going to have a bad time. ;)\n\nThe game also includes a load of meta knowledge to it. be careful what you do, the game knows about what you do. Saving the game will not save you from the acts that you have done. but with that said, it's also very forgiving. the game won't stop you from making different choices, it will just mention how much of a coward you are, or how bad you are at fighting this boss for the 18th time. With all this meta information here it serves as entertainment for the player, enjoy the experience as much as you can, play exactly how you want, and please don't spoil anything for yourself. if you are thinking about buying the game, do so without watching someone else play past the first snowy or pink ruins area.\n\nGo forward with love, or destroy your enemies, whatever you choose, play how you want. As the game says, you don't have to kill anyone, and as the game implies that means you can also kill everyone. Your choices matter. ♥\n\nSo now the standard game rating:Story: 11/10 (Writing this even after my initial hype has worn off, I can step back and say this is a truly unique story that I love, I won't ever forget it and I truly love the experience that I've had playing it. it was also a refreshing story, not like one that I have played in a very long time.)\nGameplay: 10/10 + 🎮  (Very intuitive, always fun, always challenging, there is so much to do, there are so many ways to play, the gameplay does have it's limits, but for the most part you will not get through it for a long time. As a side note, playing with a controller is 100% made for the game, you can enjoy the game with both a controller and a keyboard and still have all the same fun.)\nPresentation: 10/10 (The game is pixel style, and with that it does so much, you won't lag on this game ever, and you really should enjoy the graphics as they come. the presentation this game gives for it's graphics are perfectly fitting, hell even all the colors are well chosen. Nothing feels out of place, except for when you see a certain kickstarter character in the game, but the tsundere plane is just as entertaining as it can be, if not out of place a bit. besides, it's not like tsundere plane tries to confront you on purpose.... or anything....)\nSoundtrack: 11/10 (Oh my god the soundtrack. think about a soundtrack like the one in mother, or cave story, or or or just.... wow. I don't know how to explain it anymore than that. The soundtrack is amazing. It is unique, it is fitting as ♥♥♥♥, it is just great. Sound effects as well, they're all perfect for the game, this isn't just some pasted sound effects, this is just made for the game. It's so good.)\nReplayability: ?/10\n(The replayablity lasts for as long as you can go,\n\nSpoilers\nI played through how I pleased on the first time, got a  neutral  ending, I played through another time and  got a good ending  and I played through my last time and got  a terrible heartbreaking ending that also locks you out of the game, as a side note you can get yourself out of this but when you get to that point you can always look it up on google or just stay DETERMINED.\n\nSpoilers aside, you can play this game a lot. and then when you get done you can play again, with different outcomes. and when you choose to stop you will do that, but you do that on your own accord obviously. however all that being said you will run out of content eventually, but the replay value lasts to the maximum about 6 or a few more runs.)\nAnd a final note: this is one of the best games I have ever played if not the best, please buy this game. if you don't buy it, please ask someone who has it if they loved it, and reconsider buying it, if you cannot buy it yourself I don't know what to say, but there are many nice people in this world who are willing to give you this game.\n\nAnd finally; if you're a pirate, please buy this game. I know it doesn't mean much but after you play it you'll understand why you should have bought this game.","October 26, 2015","true","15.4"," 111 of 127 people (87%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","87","111","127","12","14"

I don't remember what day it was. Thadeus had bought me a game he loved. Undertale it was called. For a while, I didn't really want to play it. I mean, the graphics seemed... not that impressive and all I knew about it was that it was influenced by Mother/Earthbound, which granted are some of my favourite RPG's, but for some reason, I held off on playing the game.\n\nI sat down one day, Thadeus eagerly sitting on Steam chat, awaiting my reaction. I fired up the game, commented how I could tell it was made in Game Maker, cause of the collision detection. Commented how I wish the music wouldn't constantly change styles. I kinda half-♥♥♥ played it, not really paying full attention. I met Flowey, he of course was creepy as all hell, letting me know it was "kill or be killed". I killed some enemies. That's what you do in RPG's, right? I earned some EXP and felt pretty good. This character Toriel took me in, she seemed very nice. I liked her. In fact... I started to enjoy her company. Then I wanted to leave her place and move on. She blocked my way, said she was going to test if I was ready.\n\nThen I killed her.\n\n\n\nRealizing what I'd done, realizing I had killed a character who was friendly, I panicked. What happened? In other games, friendly NPC's wouldn't die if you fought them. They would stop, not let you kill them, something would keep it from happening. Yet here I sat, watching Toriel vaporize in front of me after the most blood chilling speech I've ever seen from someone friendly.\n\nI cried, I felt rotten. I felt ashamed. I reloaded the game so I could get her back. The next fight the game told me I thought of letting Toriel know I watched her die, and she said she felt like a ghost when I looked at her. Finally figuring out how to spare her I moved on. Then... Flowey appeared again. He let me know he was aware I had reloaded to try and save Toriel. I felt a chill down my spine unlike anything I've ever felt in any game. I knew it was possible for game characters to break the fourth wall but this felt like Flowey was speaking directly to me. Not the sprite on the screen, but the player controlling the sprite. Instantly I felt like I couldn't play anymore. I was scared, way out of my comfort zone. I had just played a game that held me directly responsible for taking the life of a friendly character. I shut down the game and didn't touch it again for a long time...\n\nI deleted my save file... manually... complete reset of the game... then I went back one day. Thadeus urged me to go back to it, struggling not to spoil it for me.\n\nI had an experience that changed my entire view on games. What games can do to you, how they can impact you. Undertale takes every trope, every preconception you might have about games and turn them entirely on their heads. Instead of killing everything, you are urged NOT to kill, but to use non-violent solutions. The game has no limits on who you can kill. You can kill everyone if you so desire. It is up to you if you want to kill everyone or make friends. So on my second playthrough, scarred by my initial experience, I didn't hurt anyone. And the rest of the game was honestly one of the most unforgetable experiences I've had in gaming ever, something that will truly stick with me forever.\n\nUndertale proves that 8bit sprites on a computer screen can feel as real as you and me, it proves that killing is a horrible thing and holds nothing back to push that point home. It proves that in the end, the only thing that matters is what you choose.\n\nSo choose wisely...","March 13","true","23.3"," 74 of 78 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","74","78","0","20"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/391540/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Undertale is a successfully Kickstarted game made mostly by a single person – Toby Fox. To specify the game’s genre, think of something like “creative bullet hell and comedy adventure with focus on decision making and emotional story“.\n\nYou might have already read or heard a lot of praise about Undertale, but I’ll rather start at the supposedly weakest point of the game, the graphics. Let’s be honest, they look poor even in compare to other pixelart game graphics. But as you’ll play more, you’ll realise they perfectly do their job, allowing all surprising changes and weirdness, that you’ll meet through the game, to shine.\n\nIn many other games, once you get to some sort of new gameplay feature or mini-game (e.g.: hacking in Fallout New Vegas or Deus Ex: Human Revolution, minigames in Bioshock), you’ll get to deal with them (or use them) repeatedly until they make you feel bored, for getting overused. (That also lowers your entertainment, making you more probably to rush through the specific game’s content.) Undertale is absolutely different, showing the developer’s hard work towards constant surprises for the player, with various gameplay features programmed just for specific scenes. Besides that fact, every NPC has a unique way of attacking; at least every type – but until you won’t want to kill everybody, you’ll mostly not meet each regular NPC more than twice.\n\nI’ve seen few people play Undertale and I have to say that it’s not a game for everybody to like. I’ve seen people who just took this as another JRPG, rushing through the content, fighting just with everybody and talking with disappointment like “So, what’s so great about that?” afterwards. The main point is, the game favour people who want to think like “Wait, do I have to kill him/her/it?” with a reward of a lot of entertainment and fun. People who tend to think with more creativity will love this game. Even though the battle options are straightforward, there are more possible outcomes of fights besides killing the enemy. You mostly don’t have to fight, you can find a way to turn your enemies into friends.\n\nTo summarize the story without spoilers – Undertale is about monsters that have lost a war against humans on Earth. Monsters that survived ran deep into a cavern, where they got locked by a human magic. They somehow survived thanks to magic and technology, and thanks to their hope for better future; hope to see the Sun again.\n\nMt. Ebott is a weird place – people who had gone there went missing. And you take role of a kid who falls into the mountain, into the kingdom of monsters. And from this moment, everything else is under your control. It’s up to your decision what will happen with everybody. The game has, besides some small differences, three big endings, each with absolutely different outcome.\n\nI’m not a type of person who would usually replay games ( because of my Steam game backlog) but after finishing Undertale for the first time in about 6 hours, I had to take another try for different ending... and wow. You’ll eventually find a lot more information about the characters and monsters’ history. You’ll also realise many things that together shows you the depth of the story. What may surprise you is also the fact that the game knows pretty well if you are replaying the game for another time, characters have slightly different dialogues... but I’ll not spoil more of it, let’s just say that it’s totally expected from you to play Undertale multiple times for complete experience.\n\nWhile Undertale really has an emotional story, as many reviews full of tears may tell you, don’t forget that sadness is not the only emotion. The game will also try to stimulate your happiness – not just in a way of making yourself happy for not killing your favourite character, but also by humour. There’s a joke, gag or a pop culture reference (often tailored for “Internet people”) around every corner, probably even in every character. You’ll see.\n\nThe final thing that gets the praise is the Toby Fox’s iconic soundtrack. Undertale has a perfect soundtrack, mostly composited from chiptunes. There are so many great melodies that will get stuck into your head and you’ll love them. An interesting fact, most of the game music was made before designing and programming of specific scenes they was made for – Toby Fox said that it helped him to decide how the scene should go. (Source[existentialgamer.com])\n\nConclusion:Undertale is something so unique and unexpectedly awesome, that it deserves praise without objection. It’ll make you laugh, cry, or just keeps you entertained from 6 to ~25 hours (depends on if you decide to replay the game for different endings; hint: you should).\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","April 10","true","16.2"," 80 of 93 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","80","93","5","8"

Except when it isn't. Undertale is something that deserves to be played by as many people as possible.\n\nIt's funny and lighthearted, incredibly fun to play (yes, even down to the random enemy encounters which become more of an enjoyable puzzle than a chore as you try to work out how to deal with them without violence), and incredibly heartwarming. Sometimes, certain things make me incredibly sad that I can't "wipe" my own memory of something and experience it for the first time again. I wish I could do so with Undertale.\n\nThere's minute bits of detail to be found in many places, and it seems that there's no possibility that hasn't been thought of. Fail to realise you can spare the first boss and reset to try again out of guilt? It knows.\n\nThe soundtrack is nothing short of exceptional. Just listening to the epilogue theme brings me to tears, something no other musical piece in a game has ever accomplished.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to play Undertale. You will not be disappointed.\n\n","October 16, 2015","true","8.6"," 79 of 94 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","79","94","3","2"

Now, I can't say anything about the comparisons, but Undertale fully deserves the praise it has gotten. While not the best game I've ever played, it's surely up there.\n\nPros:\n+ The gameplay is unique and never gets boring. despite the fight scenes getting repetitive they manage to be different each time.\n+ The soundtrack is AMAZING. Many of the themes are remixed versions of each other, for example: CORE and Death by Glamour. Many songs tell a lot about the situation and character, such as Heartache and ASGORE.\n+ The jokes are great. Some would say otherwise, but it really depends on your sense of humor.\n+ Everything you do matters. Your choices change the ending and the game remembers everything you do.\n+ A well written storyline with multiple paths. The game doesn't try to force you to feel anything, it actually makes you feel. Many other games try way too hard to evoke emotion. "PRESS F TO PAY RESPECTS"\n+ The characters are amazing. They all have unique personalities and dialogue. The sprites, both overworld and battle, are well made. All the main NPCs are extremely memorable, one example being Papyrus.\n+ The controls are simple and tight.\n+ Really good and rewarding boss fights. The Neutral and No Mercy final bosses are some of my favorites. Do not search them up to avoid spoilers.\n\nCons:\n- The player character's design clashes with the artstyle A LOT. I get that Toby wanted to make them gender ambigious, but the fact that the sprite is terrible and so emotionless doesn't help. We have all these unique and colorful sprites and then there's this stupid yellow blob walking around going -_-. "Woah that fish is trying to kill me... -_-"\n- While I like how the game remembers your choices from previous runs, many people like to start from scratch.\n- The beginning, while not bad, is slow and boring, and can cause a lot of people to stop before Snowdin.\n- The community. While it's not the game's fault, and it's not the worst out there and not as bad as others such as FNAF, it still detracts from the game because you almost don't want to talk about in public because of how bad it's becoming.\n- Zero settings. While graphic options aren't needed in this game, I'd love to change up the volume.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nUndertale is one of the best RPGs I've ever played and one of the best games in general.\nI have to give it a 10/10. If you haven't, play it now, and hope you go in blind.","January 1","true","23.7"," 67 of 77 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","67","77","7","3"

Believe it or not, this game never feels like it was made to pander; instead, it feels like it exists as a labor of love, a tribute to what makes video games in general great. Because of this, it's very easy to distance what the game actually is from whatever the heck some parts of the fanbase want it to be.\n\nIt does truly upset me that many people are so disgusted by the rabid fanbase that they're turned off from playing Undertale, but this game has a massive following for a very good reason - I myself feel horrible I waited so long to experience it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/391540/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account",""Love is the strongest emotion of them all"\nThat was my thoughts throughout playing undertale. Honestly it was a fantastic experience that shows a different side of the regular RPG genre. It is filled with so much emotion and weirdness! Undertale is on the way to becoming my personal GOTY! Undertale is a difficult game to review due to it's very different nature but i'm going to try my best.\n\nTo realize why undertale is so great you first have to understand it's combat system. As the game advertises you don't actually have to kill anyone in the game. You have 2 options, to fight or to take other action. Other actions are related to the enemy you are up against. Your task is too discover what the enemy likes as too make them surrender to fighting you. It's more difficult then you might think. It takes a certain degree of skill to figure out how best to act to either make the enemy feel sorry for you, go to sleep, want to be your friend or a whole host of different outcomes.\n\nBut if you don't want to follow this new tactic then you still have the option of full on combat. Between attacks you will need to defend enemies attacks. This takes part in a kinda bullet hell style way. You control a small heart and have to avoid enemy bullets. Bullets are shot in a huge range of different patterns or styles that are unique to the enemy. I really enjoyed this defensive stystem. It is still integrated even if you opt to not attack enemies so you won't see yourself getting bored.\n\nSeems i'm going off track a bit here. I was explaing the way to attack. Anyway you attack through a kind of rhythm system. The closer to the centre you click the bar the more damage you will do. Throughout the game you will pick up different weapons that alter this combat slightly. They give you different patterns that are more difficult to use. This spices up the combat a bit. Combat isn't particularly intuitive or full of variety but it was good enough to enjoy.\n\nThe other thing that makes undertale stand out above other games is the story. It is hard to go into too much details without spoiling it. But the story is full of twists and turns, love and hatred. There are so many characters that each have the most unique of personaliltys and feelings towards each of the other characters. Character development builds up amazingly and you really get to know each character. This is where I also get to my point about love. It makes it much easier to show compasion for enemies in combat that you actually who they are.\n\nSo I said earlier you have an option of killing enemies or sparing them. But does this really make a difference? The answer is a big yes! Undertale has multiple different endings. They all count on what choices you made in the world. So there is a so called "pacifist" ending for if you don't kill anyone or an opposite ending for killing everyone as well as others. I have currently experienced two of these. They are each so different to each other and it is well worth going back to play again to get each and every ending. The only issue I would state is that you have go through about 4 hours worth of gameplay that is almost identical to get to it which can be a bit boring.\n\nA single playthrough is roughly 6 hours. I would say that is a reasonable length considering that you can replay it so many times!\n\nRestarting even affects the world. The world will be different depending on what choices you made in your last playthrough. Characters will remember some things and parts of the world may be slightly different. It's not a big deal but it does add a little bit to the gameplay.\n\nThe graphics is something that probably wouldn't appeal to everyone. I personally love them though. I always fall for pixelated graphics when they are done well. And undertale definitely does it well. There is so much detail in the characters and areas of the world. It really does stand out.\n\nThe soundtrack is absoluetly outstanded as well. There is so much emotion in each of the tracks. Immediately after finishing the 2nd playthrough I went onto youtube to listen to the soundtrack again. It's that good!\n\nThere are a few other small details that put me off slightly from the game though. Most aren't a big deal but they are worth mentioning.\n\nThe first being an issue with the soundtrack. Wheras most areas of the world have a soundtrack playing in the background there are some areas that are missing a soundtrack. This just makes them feel bland and boring to explore.\n\nThe game suffers from blackboxing. There are black bars on the left and right so it is never true full screen. On top of this the game has a 30fps lock to it. Since it's a 2D game it's not too big of a deal but some people may care.\n\nThat was it for the issues I had with it. Undertale is a fantastic game that adds a lot of variety to the classic RPG games and has a brillant engaging story to go with the unique gameplay. For the amount of replayability you can get out of it £6.99 is an absolute steal for such a good game. I will definitely be going back for another playthrough to get yet another ending out of it. I would recommend it to anyone that loves a good story in a game or just wants to spice up their gameplay a bit.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was provided a free key by the developer to make this review.","September 20, 2015","true","14.0"," 63 of 75 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","63","75","0","10"

I disregarded this message, because I had read so many comments about this game, making it sound like a kid’s game.\n\nWhen my first real fight came, I made a conscious choice to attack, assuming that somehow, the fight would end well - I was already too attached to this character to see her perish so quickly. And I made a mistake. Flowey was right. I was upset with myself, and regretted my choice - an absolute rarity in any video game - and reset to an earlier time. I found a way to endure this fight, and moved forward, only to be confronted by Flowey. He reminded me of what I did, and it felt like a punch in the gut. I wanted so badly to hide my rash actions, but he knew, and I was ashamed. In less than an hour, Undertale made me feel wonder, joy, excitement, despair and regret - emotions video games rarely make me feel anymore. For this reason, I must recommend this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/391540/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Undertale is a roleplaying game developed by Toby Fox, releasing on Steam in September 2015.\n\nYou play Undertale from a top down perspective, as you control a child. You navigate through “Underground”. Scattered around the Underground, you will encounter plenty of different enemies. The “combat” system in Undertale is where this game will differ from other RPG games of this type. First of all, the regular attacking in combat is done via a QTE sort of mechanic as you have to hit the action button in the right spot to do more damage. This adds a skill level to the combat rather than just relying on stats and equipment. Secondly, the other options when in a fight are much more diverse, such as sparing an enemy, which means letting them live, or you can simply talk to the enemy, whether it be flirting with them, joking, or complimenting them. Each way of interacting with the enemy will result in a different outcome at the end of the fight.  When the enemy attacks you though, you have to again take part in a small mini game, which usually requires you to dodge out of the way of certain objects which are flying at your LV (your love…the game will explain at the beginning). I am not normally a fan of QTEs but Undertale does a good job of masking the mechanic by portraying it in an original way.\n\nVisually, this game is by no means a good looking game. It’s the basic of basics of 8 bit graphics. If you grew up playing games with these sorts of graphics, I can probably see you getting a huge nostalgia hit, but if you missed that era, and then you will probably not fully enjoy the art style. Personally I didn’t like it at all. It is way too basic and minimalistic for me. I need something more pleasing to look at. The sound track of this game is brilliant though, composed by the developer himself, there is some absolutely awesome tracks to be heard throughout the game. If you are the sort of person that really appreciates video game music, I would recommend you pick up the Soundtrack for sure!\n\nWhere most people will say Undertale succeeds brilliantly, is the story. I am not going to go into any spoilers at all as I know it is a touchy subject, but you meet some very original characters, some quirky and hilarious as you progress through the game.  The way your story pans out will be determined by your actions throughout the game.  Undertale has three different endings. It’s nice to see a game where your choices really do have a lot of weight behind them, as we have come all too familiar with games giving us the illusion that our choices matter, when in fact we just end up in the same place at the end anyway.\n\nI wouldn’t say Undertale is a hugely difficult game. The puzzles are easy enough once you take a step back and think it through clearly. If you are fighting enemies, the combat is fairly easy too; you just have to be good at QTEs to be able to progress without any real problems.  Completing one of the endings took me just over three hours. I am not sure whether I feel like I want to go into Undertale again to see the other endings, because the game is fairly slow paced and I am really not a fan of the art style and graphics. I think I would be more tempted to way a play through on YouTube of the other endings as I would only be doing it for the story element. Obviously if you are a fan of the gameplay you can probably get about ten hours of content from Undertale.\n\nSadly, as surprisingly as it sounds, I had technical problems with Undertale – and I wasn’t the only one. The game simply wouldn’t launch. This was fixed using the following Steam community post - https://steamcommunity.com/app/391540/discussions/0/496879865892998743/#p3 The game can be played using either keyboard or controller. I would personally favour the controller though, given the QTEs and simple controls other than those.\n\nTo sum up, I’m not going to say Undertale is a must play game like most people. Yes I can see why people see it as being earth shatteringly good, but I really don’t see what all the fuss is about. The game play is slow paced and bland and graphically it is just awful.  What you are getting with Undertale is a fantastic sound track, and hugely original plot. I can quite happily say I could have got the same experience out of Undertale from just watching a play through online. Credit where credit is due though, the story is really good and it is probably Undertale’s biggest selling point. The game has a good price point at £6,99 so even if you are on the fence, it’s not like you are going to break the bank with trying it out.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Undertale is not a conventional game. And SHOULD NOT be COMPARED with any other.\nSO STOP.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adam1224/recommended/391540/","adam1224","adam1224","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adam1224/","1546 products in account","It's really hard to write a review about Undertale - as the featured Courator shorty says, "To explain exactly why Undertale is truly special would require spoiling the experience, so I urge you to look past the hype and just play it yourself."\nTechnical explanation AKA what to expect as gameplay first, and a little about the story and characters later. I'll try to keep it as spoiler free as I can - I'll likely give general description about a character or two, avoiding the actual plotlines and happenings.\n\nIt's a really one of a kind of a game of the current times. Controls come from the NES era - four directions + two buttons. If you attack an enemy, you need to stop a bar running through a scale - the closer you are to the middle, the more damage you do, and certain weapons have different attack "patterns" - with the basic stick you just smack them, with the tough glove you can deliver a couple less damaging hits, dealing somewhat more damage overall. I don't know about the other weapons as I was only playing the pacifist route, and I think that's the more intresting one, because of it's mechanism.\nA really small dive into the lore of Undertale: Monster's soul is closely linked to their bodies - weakening their will of fight will weaken them, and you literally can win a fight without raising your hand once for anything other than a hug or pet. While you try to figure out how you can make your enemy happy, less miserable, comfort them etc, you need to dodge their attack in a bullet-hellish scenario. It never gets boring, as each of the enemy types have at least one unique pattern - and by unique, I MEAN unique. One of my favourites was is one of the earliest enemy, a cockroach-like monster: if he had company he swarms the screen like the bugs do, but if he's alone, he just starts awkwardly dancing a wave. Almost all the bullet hell patterns are linked to the actual characters in theme, pattern or shape of the weapon/form of the monster, introducing changed movement against some enemies as well.\nWhat was the most fun in the game for me? Two different, but linked things:\nFirst, the pacifist route's way of defeating enemies. Just as a random example: you can across a monster named like Blurghartarmut , looks as a giant horse figurine from chess, says something to you and then good luck, figure out how to defeat it! Sometimes the name, sometimes the form or the quote helps you to pick out the option to defeat it - some bigger enemies require a specific order of "acts".  In this example of the chess-horse/knight, what do you do? Treat it like a horse, combing it's mane, give sugar cubes, compliment on his speed, or tell him that the other coloured King is defeated, there is peace, no need to fight?  Bear in mind that if one action is enough to defeat an enemy, then there is only one correct answer, and you need to figure it out based on the response. I think it's a really nice little mindgame.\nAnd the second favourite thing of mine is: the whacky writing, and the really, really creative world, character building and what a funny tone the game can have. It's a little like you take one really creative person who then makes jokes, situations and a world out of the jokes and image of the world of a 6 year old. There are a lot of puns in the game, lot of funny situations, and surprisingly, it's full with double-meaning content, and usually you need to take things literally to get through things, but it's just... not always obvious, which is great! It's like putting up a note on a wall at 5M, waiting someone to get a ladder to be able to read it, to find a message " I can't believe you made so far for nothing / how's the weather up here? / Yes, you did it! Now what?"  It's somewhat random, but not the trollface, ohlololol level of being annoying, but the way that after a few hours you realize that if a character tells you a generic-sounding "Come and drop by my place" then you don't question whether you can go or not, you immediately go to find out what quirky/funny stuff the game has to show to you. Sounds really weird, but basically exploration and curiosity is rewarded with joy and fun.\nAnd about the characters: there are a couple of NPCs who only have a few lines of talk, but they usually still give some information about the area, or have some connection to the story if you pay attention - like how a monster wishes for the school to close because of re-activated puzzles, and later you can see a new's cast telling the schools are closed for the very same reason. There are a couple of traders in the game, and you can talk to them about the world/themselves, they can contribute more to the story - at a point there's like a mini-plot going on between two traders, so it's intresting to explore it.  And finally, the "main" NPC characters - they are as different as they can get. Puzzle-obsessed kool guy skeleton, pun loving skeleton, hardcore fight-loving guard, eccentric scientist, the mysterious King you hear a lot about during your journey... they very, very often have interactions between them, various connections, friendships and rivalries that are subject of change during the game.  It's a rare thing to say, but I think in this game not the player character has character development, but all of the main NPCs - if one's willing to spend time with the game and the characters, it can give so much more character-wise than an average RPG, as multiple stories are told, and you can have a part in all of them.\nNot to mention that the game has a killer  lovely music selection, areas and main characters, important enemies all have an awesome soundtrack of their own - if you want to check them out, you can find them on Youtube. Just be careful, comments are ridden with spoilers about the game, don't check them before playing it.\n\nSo yes, I can totally recommend the game if you like the base concept available as a description.\nYou can also download the demo of the game from the official website of: http://undertale.com/demo.htm . Keep in mind that according to the Undertale wiki "The Undertale Demo is extremely brief, buggy, and less detailed compared to the final game. [...] the demo has a much higher encounter rate in the first area compared to the final game."  But it's still a good way to get a first-hand impression of the game without buying it.","April 21","true","23.3"," 51 of 65 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","51","65","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pineapplesama/recommended/391540/","pineapplesama","Crim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pineapplesama/","23 products in account","Let's not pretend that this game is not a phenomena. Like it or hate it, there's no disputing that this game is probably one of the biggest indie releases to date, regarding sales and sheer popularity. Basically anyone with a Steam account, or socail media, or anyone that uses the internet in general, has heard of this game. So, with this review, I'm not going to pretend that most people out there have not heard of this game and are completely clueless to it. Everyone talks about this game to a near obnoxious level, so the goal of my review is to try and convince anyone out there that's scepticle, that's completely uninterested because of how annoyed they are about hearing about it, that's completely turned off by the game and turn away from it simply because Tumblr has jumped straight into its trash chute. Because here's the thing. The worst thing about this game is its popularity. So again, my goal with this review is to not recommend, but IMPLORE that you listen and take my words into consideration. Because despite how much flack this game has gotten (when you forget about the immense praise it actually gets), this game is worth it. It deserves to be remembered, and I fully believe it can stand the test of time.\n\nSo with all of that established and out of the way, here's where I answer the main question. 'What is so great about Undertale?'. Well, a lot of things when you look at it all from a technical level. The story is very well thought out, written, and paced, the characters are all memorable (and despite a lot of opinions, very multi-dementional. It's called subtlty, people, these characters are "tropey" because that's only their outward appearance.) The music is fantastic, the gameplay is really fun and unique, and almost constantly changes the rules on you. It almost NEVER gets repetitive like a lot of standard RPG's usually are. That is... Depending on how you play. I'm sure most people already know what I'm talking about, the option to either FIGHT or SPARE. This is where most people get their experience spoiled and I know a lot of you out there know exactly what I'm talking about.\n"NO, DON'T FIGHT, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU!"\n"YOU'RE PLAYING THE GAME WRONG, "YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A BAD TIME!""\nI know how it is. Backseat gamers are super annoying. But here I am, a massive Undertale fan saying PLAY HOW YOU WANT. Your first time through, do what you feel like doing. It's a part of the experience, don't worry about what others say. Yes, your actions weigh heavily on the outcome of the story, and it's done in a way that actually MEANS something to the story of the game. But you are still a person playing a video game. It's YOUR experience, so treat it that way.\n\nBut again, getting back on track, 'What is so great about Undertale?'. Yes, all the technical aspect of the game are good and appealing, but what has gotten it so much hype? How is it that some consider it, quite literally, to be "one of the greatest games of all time"? There are so many out there that say that it's unfathomably overrated and should be thrown away and forgotten because no one will stop talking about it. "It doesn't deserve the hype". This is where most people, even die hard fans of the game, can't explain why it's NOT overrated. This is what's disapointing to the smaller group of people that love this game, such as me. The ones that love it for the entire point of the game. The thing that Toby Fox himself wanted players to see.\nUndertale is one of those rare games that not only try to push the boundaries of what video games as an artform are capable of doing, telling a story and giving an experience, but also exceed its attempt. No other game before has done the things Undertale has done quite like Undertale. There are similar concepts used in other things that have come before, but still. Nothing quite like Undertale has done. Because Undertale doesn't use these unique concepts, which I will not explain and leave whomever is interested to find out for themselves, as a gimmick. An experiment or something new to try out. It takes full advantage of what it does and uses it in the context of the game's lore and story. It's something that, I as a player, brought me into this game's world and story far deeper than any game has done before. It made me feel literally a PART of the story. Some would say that's digging way too deep into fiction, but that's the thing. That is what I love about this game.\n\nIt has been a pretty long amount of time since I have played a video game and actually FELT like I was a part of it. Like I was IN it. That's something I always felt as a kid playing games, I always really felt like I was in whatever world I was experiencing, and I always felt like I actually knew the characters personally. Because that's just what happens when you're a kid. Fiction isn't so far from reality. And that is one of the biggest things that Undertale does right, with absolute flying colors. It takes that feeling, that suspension of disbelief that only a child could have, and uses the concepts and the way it tells its story to fully immerse the player like that. This game made me feel like I was 9 years old again, playing some of my first really good games for the first time again. That's what I think so many people love about this game, even those that don't fully realize it. That's what makes Undertale so great.\n\nFor those thinking about, or about to go into this game, even after all the hype and all the spoilers being thrown out there without any care, going in and expecting this absolute grand masterpiece of a video game, and point out every little tiny flaw and subjective thing that you don't like and feel the need to criticize the game for it, to the finest, sharpest detail possible... Just play the game. Pretend you're 9 years old again, and just experience the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TwistyOtter/recommended/391540/","TwistyOtter","Twisty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TwistyOtter/","416 products in account","Undertale; My Game of the Year and maybe even the best game I've ever played!\nAt the time of writing I've put around fifteen hours into the game. I've completed a full pacifist run and am currently busy with finishing up the genocide run. I'm also listening to the game's soundtrack as I'm writing this (yes the soundtrack is THAT good!)\n\nIntroduction\nUndertale is a RPG game with a unique combat system. As the game advertises "Killing is unnecessary: negotiate out of danger using the unique battle system." this is something that I've never seen before in any RPG I've played. The player is basically allowed to either spare or kill the opponent and choosing what you'll do will greatly change the outcome of the game's story.\n\nWhen it comes to defending against monster attacks there isn't a simple 'Defend' button or action the player can choose during a turn. To defend against incoming attacks, the player has to dodge 'bullets' just like a Touhou game, the way you defend against monsters also changes throughout the game. Especially during bossfights you'll encounter different ways to dodge the bullets.\n\nStory\nOh boy are you in for a treat. This game has one of the most unique and compelling stories I've seen in a 'simple' 2D RPG. I won't spoil too much about it since I greatly recommend you go into the game as fresh as you can. Don't look up any spoilers, don't follow guides. Enjoy this experience on your own!\n\nWhen it comes down to the story, you'll cry. You will cry a lot. The game plays with your emotions. It will twist and turn your view on what is right and what is wrong and why you do certain actions in a video game. (Like, why do you kill everything in your path while you're playing Final Fantasy?)\n\nIn short, the story is about a world where humans and monsters used to live together happily. A war broke out and the monsters fled to the underground. One day you, the player, falls down a hole where you wake up in the underground or 'Home' where the player will encounter different monsters. Everybody despises humans due to the past and your job is to make your way back to the surface!\n\nCharacters\nThis game has a set of incredibly memorable characters. Every character in the game has a different kind of font in the text boxes, putting an emphasis on the variation between characters. There's silly characters, serious characters, incredibly complex characters and a very, very motherly character.\n\nEach of the characters have an interesting background story (if you dig deep into the game's story, that is) that you'll love to find out! Each character has a different appeareance, there's no copy-pasting as far as I'm aware.\n\nCombat\nAs I've mentioned before, the game's combat is very unique in a sense that you either have to attack or act. Attacking basically requires you to time your button press right. A line will go from left to right and your job is to hit the center of the screen as precisely as possible. Once you do so your attack will be at full power and you'll land a pretty hard blow.\n\nThe uniqueness of the combat system, however. Is when you act. Acting is basically choosing between different kinds of dialogue. Once you encounter a monster and you act, you'll have different options. The options differ from hugging, to picking on somebody to petting. Depending on what you choose you'll calm your opponent down and you can spare them. This won't give you EXP, but it will give you gold.\n\nAtmosphere\nThe game's atmosphere in general is pretty joyful, the music makes the game feel like a good-feel 80's RPG (I'm looking at you, Earthbound.)\n\nHowever, the atmosphere changes drastically when you decide to kill everybody. Towns become deserted, people will be afraid of you, dialogue changes significantly, etc. It becomes incredibly gritty and the music changes to a pretty horror-esque version of the original happy good-feel soundtrack.\n\nBossfights\nThis game has some amazing bossfights, every single one of them has a different kind of attack pattern which will be different every single time a new attack comes up. They don't vary per encounter, however. So if you're stuck at a certain boss, you'll be able to remember the pattern and repeat the process until you've finally defeated them!\n\nMusic\nThis game has one of the greatest soundtracks ever. Like, you know when you're fighting a final boss in a game. The music just kicks in and it pumps you up so much you just want to end it? You just need to get rid of them and save the world? Yeah, the game's soundtrack will do this to you. It will make you DETERMINED to win!\n\nIn short\nThis game is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. No, it's not a game. It's an experience. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry and it will do so much to you! I'm sure you'll enjoy every single minute of this! Lovable characters, great music, great story and an amazing atmosphere put together by mostly one person! You can't go wrong for ten bucks!\n\nTL;DRAmazing soundtrack, lovable characters, fun atmosphere and in-depth story make this game a unique experience you won't forget. It'll stick with you for a long time and it'll be very memorable.\n\nPros\nGreat soundtrack\n\nUnique and lovable characters\n\nAmazing story\n\nGreat replay value if you want to find out all of the story behind the game\n\nVery unique combat system and bosses\nCons\nTouhou dodging can be a bit clunky due to 8-axis restriction of Game Maker\n\nYou will cry, lots.\n\nThe game will make you feel really bad about yourself and your choices.\n10/10","September 28, 2015","true","26.3"," 49 of 62 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","49","62","4","9"

Incredibly good and enjoyable despite frustrations\n\n+Absolutely creative. The game seems to never run out of ideas.\n+Extremely stupid(ly good) writing. Its simple enough for anyone to enjoy but mature when it has to be\n+Choices matter! Holy ♥♥♥♥, finally!\n+Lore is deep and well crafted.\n+Characters have a personality! Havent seen that in a while , I missed games with charisma\n+Unique fight system that encourages you to think instead of just attacking. Each fight is a puzzle\n+The themes and overall message changes on your actions, making each player feel specialy involved\n+Despite bosses are somewhat harsh, you pretty much are deeply invested into winning. That is hard to achive, and Undertale manages to suck you in for that.\n+ The unique fight system ( attack or pacify) adds a layer of possibility for those who want a challange of emotion\n+The true ending is , by no doubts, one of the best ive seen\n\n+/- Might be that im a guy who studied humor for years as a cartoonist, but the comedy in Undertale is allright, but falls into a childish category. Puns galore, slapstick and some rather weak lines. There so bad they're good - that kind of mediocre. Maybe thats the point. Still made me chuckle in joy, but I can see many disliking it\n-/+ THE BOSSES. Holy moly they are a challanging in a bad way. (as stated before, it can be dimished by the investment in the story, but beating them the first time is a grindfest of trial and error)\n-/+ The unique fight system ( attack or pacify) is flawed, as it can make you waste time doing an action for no results , spending long periods in unnessesary long encounters.\n\n-The fanbase. No, seriously. Avoid Tumblr like the plauge. It can deeply harm your vision of the game . ♥♥♥♥ing hell, avoid TUMBLR because its Damn Tumblr!\n\n9 outta 10.

One word...Undertale...\n\nIve never had a game get to me like this in a long time. Or...ever really now that I think about it. This game is short yes, but I think people need to experience at least once in there life. I have never seen a story this fleshed out, characters this genuine and endearing. Mechanics that are simple but insanely impactful.\n\nIf the games tagline doesn't say it all, the idea of this game is its a RPG where no one has to die. In almost every fight you will have the option to talk your way out of conflict, be it by saying the right things, meeting certain conditions or just enduring until the enemy tires so you can SPARE them. Honestly think of it like a normal RPG, just instead of feeling out elemental weaknesses or resistances your trying to find out if you should laugh at the monsters bad joke or scold him for it. for about 99% of the game you will never EVER need to use the FIGHT command in your battle menu. This goes for bosses too, who are ALL lovable and memorable. They can even become your friends and you can get to know then better. That said...violence is still an option at all times and it will honestly tempt you, because with violence comes power. Letting enemies live will get you no XP or levels, playing a pacifist means you will ALWAYS be Level 1 from the beginning to the end. But playing what people call a Genocide Run results in a DRASTICALLY different experience, its not for the faint of heart.\n\nSo in the end the choice is yours will you slay or spare your enemies? Will you make friends or make corpses. The choice is yours, make sure you don't regret it.","September 16, 2015","true","18.4"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","36","43","0","0"

The trasure hidden behind the waterfall? The special dialogue you can access by completing objectives in some roundabout whackass way? The tiny details created just to make a game oh so slightly more polished?\n\nUndertale is "the little things you love in videogames": The Videogame.\n\nUndertale is at its heart, a turn-based RPG inspired by the atmosphere, music, and so on of Earthbound. There are storylines to follow, battles to fight, items to hoard.\n\nBut the real magic of Undertale comes from the heart put into it. Every possible scenario has a joke or gem of a detail shoved into it- Toby Fox prepares for every silly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t idea you can pull out of you ♥♥♥ and try to stump the game with. As my friend Silent (who gave me the game thx bby) said, you can pet a dog to end the battle, but what happens if you just keep petting it. And then what happens if you pet it some MORE? What if I backtrack all the way to the first screen at the end of the game? What if I try giving an NPC this self-replicating item I found? The possibilities are nearly endless, and it honestly feels like Toby has prepared for each and everyone.\n\nOf course, the practical aspects of the game are fantastic too. I've never been big on turn-based RPGs bar Pokemon (out of habit at the point really), so the gameplay was a very refreshing change of pace. Playing Undertale as you would Final Fantasy or something, grinding lower level mobs endlessly and sparing no enemy you face, quickly leads to bad times in more ways than one. The main advertisement hook the game offers is that it's an RPG in which no one has to die, and that's true. Playing in a pacifist manner leads to you letting the enemy have their turns to attack whilst you figure up how to flirt with them until they give up. As such, the main challenge is defending, which is done in a simple bullet hell manner. Well, sometimes it's pretty easy, so maybe I'd say it's just bullet Heck most of the time, but still. It reminds me of the combat in the Mario & Luigi series- impacted by timing and dodging skills. Each enemy has a unique attack pattern, and each boss has a new mechanic to throw at you. Watch out for blue attacks!\n\nThe story is something I'll not go into much. It's fantastic, but all you need to know going in is that the characters are lovable, the universe's mechanics are unique, and cacti are extremely hard to impress. My favorite game has long been Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, another game with strong examples of the above, and Undertale is seriously contending to take its spot.\n\nThe music is probably the other strongest part of the game. Toby "Radiation" Fox has crated bangin' music for a variety of other pieces of media, including the infamous Homestuck webcomic. Widely-loved and widely-hated, the thing I've seen most people agree on is that its music is fantastic, and Toby helped contribute to it with songs like Megalovania, Black, and many more. The sheer number of songs, compunded by their quality, makes the music almost as much of a seperate experience as the game itself. I mean, there's three full songs for the joystick config menu depending on what season it is, for christ's sake.\n\nAnyway, Undertale is my GOTY (out of three games released this year that I've played, wauw), and I'd highly reccommend it for anyone looking for a great story, fun gameplay, and the latest, freshest, dankest memes. Ten bucks has gotten me much less.","October 27, 2015","true","25.1"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","38","47","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xenikobalt/recommended/391540/","xenikobalt","Xeni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xenikobalt/","270 products in account","I've finished twice, am watching several friends and my brother play through it, and still can't stop thinking about this game. Apparently, this is a common side effect for players of Undertale. Trust me, for $10 USD, you'll be sentencing yourself to what I daringly consider the best RPG experience I've ever seen. Having been an RPG fanatic my entire life, I don't say this lightly, and it was so important to me that I express my feelings for Toby Fox's masterpiece. So, here we go!\n\n\n\nGRAPHICS - Don't judge the game by what you see in the trailer\nLet's forget about graphical standards for a moment, because seriously, that shouldn't have been a selling point to any game in the first place. Undertale uses an incredibly simplistic art style to paint a deep and atmospheric world that would perhaps be difficult to digest otherwise. The battle screens feature exclusive monochromatic full body sprites of your "enemies". I had to mention these specifically because they just look gorgeous. In fact, they become progressively more so. Limbs and smaller features become animated, and everybody becomes larger and more cleverly designed on this black-and-white canvas. It honestly felt like graphically, the game was transforming, growing up while I played it. That's not to say that the early game features bland, one-dimensional character designs. You'll fall for everyone, early and late game, but you'll see what I mean about the game's animations becoming increasingly complex as you progress. The worlds outside of the starting area, the Ruins, are incredibly detailed too. It's a shame they aren't really featured in the trailer or store page.\n\nSo yeah... You seriously just need to trust me on this, or have a look at some more of the game for yourself, if you can handle some potential spoilers.\n\n\n\nGAMEPLAY - There is no RPG experience out there like this one\nFans of the Earthbound/Mother series will feel right at home with Undertale in that its gameplay elements are heavily inspired by the cult classic series. It features a standard, top-down overworld chock full of enjoyable puzzles and amusing secrets to discover. Any player knows that the battle system is what really shines in this game, however. Like Earthbound, Undertale sports a first-person combat screen, complete with a streamlined interface that's extremely easy for RPG fans and non-fans alike to understand. I specifically think of non-fans when I say this, but I will get to that in a moment.\n\nThere are four menus on your UI. FIGHT is exactly what it is: your standard attack function. It has a sort of wind-up bar for scoring critical hits that I can only describe as something you'd see in a dated golfing simulator while practicing your backswing. It's extremely simple, and if you're good at timing, you can easily land a ton of heavy hits on your foes.The second menu, ACT, is the opposite of its aggressive counterpart. While the game gives you the option to slaughter anybody that stands in your way during your adventure, it also encourages the alternative option to solve your problems with kindness. It's very much like the Shin Megami Tensei, only that you can rely on ACTing exclusively and not have to worry about killing just to defend yourself. I'll cover a little more about that in the story part of the review. The options in the ACT menu also change based on what enemy you're interacting with, and often times, they're incredibly quirky and amusing to go through them either in a required order or just for the laughs. ITEM should be obvious, even to those possibly newer to the RPG scene. Buying or discovering consumable items in Undertale to help give you an edge in battle or story is a staple feature in the RPG genre. MERCY is the last of the four battle menus. Once you've used ACT to convince your foe into submission without violence, you can choose to spare their lives and end the battle that way. And let me tell you, there has never been a feeling more satisfying than defeating great bosses with nothing but your silver tongue, your two hugging arms, and whatever else you need to do to befriend a monster.\n\nOverall, you'll never not enjoy yourself in this game, in combat or in world. The rate of random encounters in the game is extremely low, and those random battles that you do get into are extremely satisfying in that you'll have a good laugh at Toby Fox's humour while suffering various kinds of bullethells during the enemy's turn. I also want to mention that boss battles are entirely unique, in that each of the major boss battles of the game sport a fresh, unique game mechanic that completely transforms the typical gameplay experience in different ways. Your battle screen will turn into a whole lot of ridiculous things: a platformer, a quiz show, a shoot-em-up, ... okay, I better not spoil anything!\n\n\n\nMUSIC - I've had the game's soundtrack stuck in my head non-stop for days HELP\nUndertale's soundtrack, in my opinion, has easily been Toby's most impressive work so far, featuring an insanely-addictive selection of chiptune melodies, some accompanied by more modern synthesized instruments. Toby isn't known for ambient, atmospheric soundtracks that you hear in most of today's games. If you start playing this game, I hope you're prepared for an infernal punishment of tunes that you will never be able to get out of your head until you whistle along, and even then, it'll come back around at one point or another. While you play this game, prepare to enjoy one of the greatest video game musical scores of this decade.\n\nIt's also important to mention that the music is perfectly attuned to the fluctuating mood of the game, enough to make you laugh until your chest hurts, lament until tears start welling in your eyes, or just plain get pumped up. I'll preemptively say here that the music was probably my favourite part about this game, and I'm confident many others feel the same way. If you're unsure, listen to some tracks on Youtube, but I recommend keeping it to as few tracks as possible, both because of spoilers all over the comment sections of each video, and also because you'll seriously want to experience this soundtrack for yourself firsthand.\n\n\n\nSTORY - You'll laugh, you'll cry, you might even date a skeleton\nUndertale features two polarizing branches of storyline, depending on how you choose to play the game. The fanbase has deemed these to be the Mercy and Genocide stories. The Mercy story and its ending are what people consider to be the "true" path of the game, while Genocide will offer you a bad time. I would only recommend the latter to more hardcore RPG players, due to its substantial difficulty increase. I would also recommend you have an iron will and no moral fiber whatsoever, because I know I couldn't handle the weight of playing Genocide myself.\n\nThe game starts out with an incredibly simple and predictable intro, that quickly unwinds into a rabbit hole of beautifully-written characters, humour, and evoked emotions. I won't touch the actually story, because it's worth experiencing yourself spoiler-free, but I have to say, you won't ever forget it. The writing for the game is so clever and funny that you'll split a side laughing, and then on the other hand it'll pull at your deepest heartstrings. Also, there's a skeleton that you can date. Does any other game of 2015 have skeleton dating? I didn't think so.\n\n\n\nOVERALL - 10/10, 100/100\nIf you're still reading this, I'm impressed! Now seriously, go buy it!

I stared so long a dog appeared and just stood under the title. You know, that cute fluffy white one? Then I stared even longer. The dog fell asleep. I managed to keep up my staring for a decent ten minutes after that but nothing else happened. I begrudgingly closed the window. I never played a videogame before that reminded me of how it's better to love and forgive than it is to hate and murder. That's the stuff they teach you kindergarten, but mostly because they don't want all of you arguing over the only box of crayons or the last gummy bear in the jar. This game means so much more. I'm an adult now and I've been struggling with a lot of the themes presented within this work. It was so relevant and so beautifully articulated, I didn't have the heart to do what many of peers are pushing me to do: a Genocide Run. I guess I'm not the hard-hearted person I once thought. I can't even bring myself to kill fictional characters (although I did accidentally kill Toriel on my first try and ended up resetting right away. I felt horrible!), much less hate them. I look at my current life now. There's only one person I truly despise, but this game has shifted my perspective. The anger has turned to pity. This game is the best therapy I've ever had (not that I've been to actual therapy). It's true when they say love when you can.

It's the kind of game that immediately teaches you to approach it in unusual and creative ways, as pretty much every battle and character interaction is, in itself, a sort of puzzle.  There's so much incidental dialogue; if you're the sort of person who enjoys repeatedly talking to every NPC in an RPG to see every last line they say at every point in the story, you'll be delighted with how much of that is in Undertale.  The writing strikes a really good balance of genuine emotion and humor.  I've probably laughed more at this game's jokes than almost any other game I've played.\n\nI've always been a big fan of Toby's music, and this game's soundtrack doesn't disappoint at all.  So many of the tracks are instantly catchy and specific tailored to the mood of the scene, with some tracks feeling very sentimental and nostalgic.  I've been looping the soundtrack for awhile now.\n\nEvery single part of this game feels so deliberate and carefully put together.  Not a single part of it feels like a throwaway, like, you can tell that every interactible object had some amount of thought put into its description.  You don't really see "It's a door.  It's a trash can.  It's a window.  There's nothing special here." repeated ad nauseum.  Rather, checking out every single object in every room is part of the game's character.  Even that cactus in the bedroom feels like it has a personality.\n\nI really like this game.

A game made by the developer of Earthbound Halloween Hack and one of the music writers of the webcomic series of Homestuck. is one of the best RPGs i have ever played. The basic premise is you have control over who lives and dies! You can play through the entire game without killing a single creature or go onto a mass genocide and wipe out anyone that opposes you. The story is too good to ruin with a review and as such i refuse to do so.\n\nThis game has multiple endings depending on who is killed, who is saved, and who you befriend however there is three major endings to the game. The Pacifist ending (where you kill nothing and befriend all possible people.) The neutral (where you do anything you wish. saving who you want and killing who you want.) and the Genocide ending which well.. is kinda obvious.\n\nI have only gone through the game twice. (once for my first blind run through pacifist. and the other because someone i care about finds the system a bit too overwhelming as its a bit too bullet helly for them.) and i already have 28 hours on my record. For an $11 CAD game. you really can't go wrong with this.\n\nI recommend that if you do play this game. Expect passionate feelings from this game. I feel that this game definately has the developers "heart" and "soul" melded into it and his passion quickly filled me with the passion to enjoy and love this game.\n\nI am however intensely surprised that gamemaker of all programs was used to make this game! I seriously never knew it had the power to do it. But this game shows just how well it can really make games!\n\nI say if you have a few dollars laying around and are looking for an engaging and funny while still heart string plucking RPG then grab this game immediately.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grand/recommended/391540/","grand","Grand Inquisitor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grand/","117 products in account","To the viewer,\n\nUndertale is a little indie JRPG developed by Toby Fox, aka "Radiation", known for his Earthbound Halloween ROM hack and composing music for the popular webcomic Homestuck. I would like to be one of the many to say that this is his magnum opus, his most well-made and well-written work in any given medium, if not the best indie video game ever developed. I could write an entire college-level essay about not only how this is a great video game, but a work of interactive art that can only be achieved through this special medium. Sadly, however, to speak of this game in such a high manor would require spoiling significant portions of the game, so I will refrain from doing such. Instead, dear viewer, please take my word that this game is not your time, but the price tag on the game itself is an insane bargain. $10 for an experience unlike any other video game published to date, with great writing, innovative combat system, mostly well designed graphics (I'll get into that later), and a soundtrack that both captures the essence of its spiritual predecessor EarthBound and modernizes it in such a way that it feels fresh and unburdened by its past.\n\nThe only thing I can really warn you about, viewer, is that Undertale has had time to accumulate a fanbase that, from the outside looking in, can be labeled most positively as "dedicated" and most negatively as "rabid and delusional". Whatever or whoever disagrees with the notion that Undertale is a perfect game is usually verbally torn to shreds or damnd to being ignored. I will be one to say that the game is not perfect, but it is so close to perfection that its flaws are frequently overshadowed. Whatever flaws that this game has is subject to what the player sees as a flaw, even those who are blind to such flaws.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys good narrative and a meaning to their actions within the game. The ability to spare one's opponents play a role in the plot that I will not mention because doing so would be doing the developers an injustice to their work. Please trust me, the common man, that Undertale is a game for just about everyone and that you will not regret your decision of purchasing this game, if you do so.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this recommendation, dear viewer,\nGrand Inquisitor","February 28","true","13.1"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","30","34","0","4"

Quite a lot, actually, and most of it regarding this game with praise. This JRPG is a wonderful mix of humor and seriousness that is absolutely oozing with story. All of the characters in this game are so loveable, you'll have a hard time even hating the bad guys. The story and lore is a welcome for both the casual and hardcore players alike, each new playthrough having you learn new things each time. Combat on this isn't all that bad either, making a fun combination of bullet-hells and turn-based fighting.\n\nPros:\n+ Various colorful characters that are well written and have their own personality\n+ A story that unravels the more you play it and discover new things\n+ It has choice and consequences that actually matter, where the endings have major differences depending on how you chose to play\n+ You can kill everything if you want to, but you could alternatively win the day by being nice to everything you come across\n+ Plenty of hidden mechanics and features that could affect the story in smaller scales\n+ Turn-based combat that is still engaging and keeps you on your toes\n+ Absolutely amazing soundtrack\n\nCons:\n- Some jokes can be dragged out for too long\n- One or two battles seem needlessly tacked on for padding\n\nI will try my best not to reveal any major spoilers, but be prepared in case something slips.\n\nThe game opens with an intro cinematic of still images, describing an ancient time when humans and monsters lived together. For unknown reasons, a war breaks between the two races. The monsters are easily defeated by the humans, who prove to be far stronger, and are sealed away in a vast underground cave underneath a mountain. Later, after an unknown lapse of time, a child of ambiguous gender literally stumbles onto the entry. From that point on, you're given the option to choose a name and begin your adventure to find a way out.\n\nThe first monster you come across is deceitfully friendly and teaches you the basics of combat and survival. After the brief meeting, you find the second monster who guides you on how to solve some of the puzzles you will come across throughout the game as well as suggesting ways to deal with other monsters without using violence. The guide abandons you afterwards, leaving you to explore your new environment on your own. This whole zone is just a tutorial that teaches you how the game works and lets you explore ways to fight monsters. And despite the brief time you get to spend with the guide, you will feel the most emotional impact from them near the end of it.\n\nAnd that's what you'll be experiencing with every other major character you come across on your adventure. Each of them have their own traits and personality that makes them stand out from one another, and all of them is sure to make you attached to them in some degree. Even the monsters who are supposed to be your enemy have personalities that make it hard for you to hate them without wanting to know them better, first. And all of these characters can be murdered if you so desire, but remember that their blood is on your hands if you've befriended them in an older playthrough.\n\nAnd it's here that the game throws its most interesting feature at you: Characters remark that you look familiar, by recollecting events from previous saves. If you murder someone then reload, you might look like you've seen a ghost. If a character murders you, you might be able to tell them they've killed you. And they'll slightly remember you even if you reset the game and start from scratch!\n\nThis game focuses on choice and consequences which mostly impacts how the game will end. Will you be a kind and merciful child, becoming a beacon of hope and prove to the monsters that not all humans are bad, or will you be a heartless killer, destroying hopes and lives of all things that cross your path? You can also be both, simply wishing to get yourself back to the surface. For good or bad, the game will remember what you did and will choose what your ending will be.\n\nPrepare to go on a feels trip, because you're going to experience a lot of tear-wrenching plot and character development.\n\nIf you're someone who loved the story and want to know more about the important monsters, the first playthrough is going to be nowhere near satisfactory enough for you. A big thing the developers have done was leave a lot of questions unanswered, whether by accident or on purpose to encourage the players to intepret them on their own. For instance, I started the game with a desire to simply escape the underground and go back to my life on the surface. After roughly two to three playthroughs on merciful runs, I'm now writing a hypothesis on who the player character really is. Yes, this game leaves a lot of loose ends for you to tie!\n\nCombat was creatively done. Instead of the typical JRPG turn-based combat of hitting each other until one of you dies, it's instead a mix of timing and bullet-hell dodging. If you're aiming to kill, you're given a colorful bar where you have to try and get 1+ tick(s) to hit the center for maximum damage. Different weapons have different effects on top of that, such as a pair of gloves that let you punch several times at once by mashing the key to cause even more damage. Even if you're not trying to hurt anyone, there's still the bullets and obstacles the enemies throw at you in retaliation which you have to dodge.\n\nFinally, the music was very well done. After playing a game a few times, I typically start to turn the music off, because of how repetitive it's getting. In the case of Undertale, not only can I not turn the music off even if I wanted to, I find myself trying to replay a few of the really good tracks in my head when I'm not playing it!\n\nSo the ultimate question remains: Is this game worth $10? Factoring out the cons I listed near the beginning, the story and hidden lore will leave you coming back time and again searching for answers to questions you came up with while playing. You will get more than your money's worth.","October 17, 2015","true","40.9"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","31","37","5","1"

I didn't wanna get sucked into the hype like it seemed everyone else had. But I just couldn't, the game's too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good to hate.\n\nMy first run was a neutral run, I killed a few enemies at the start, skipped any optional objectives(such as the dates with Papyrus and Undyne) and went full pacifist later on(killed Muffet though, ♥♥♥♥ spiders) and my impression of the game was decidedly "meh". Then I replayed it with the intention of getting the true ending, and absolutely fell in love with it. I noticed little things in the plot that I didn't know about on my first playthrough, I did all the dates and thoroughly enjoyed every second of them, and once I got to the true final boss and ending, my opinion of the game went from "meh" to "I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game".\n\nI don't know if I could really say the writing and plot were the best I've ever experienced, but it's definitely up there. Undertale is simultaneously the happiest, funniest, saddest and scariest game I've ever played. The gameplay is leagues above any RPG I've played, completely abandoning traditional RPG gameplay and making every bit of the fights entirely skill-based, with the sparing mechanic adding a bit of a puzzle to every enemy.\n\nAnd the music. Dear god the music. I've never bought a game's soundtrack before, but I bought this one as soon as I had the funds in my Steam wallet. The music was honestly the only reason I continued playing despite not having much of an interest in the game at first, I can't describe exactly WHY I enjoyed it so much but it's easily the best soundtrack out of any game I've played\n\nDon't be stupid like me and let the batshit crazy fanbase turn you away from the game, it's truly a great experience despite each run only taking roughly 6 hours. The longer you wait to play it, the less you'll enjoy it as you'll inevitably have some things spoiled for you","December 22, 2015","true","27.4"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","25","28","4","2"

Undertale has a great and very interesting plot that draws people into the world it takes place in. Depending on the choices you make throughout the game and how much you keep a close eye on things, the story is almost always changing somehow, weather it's drastically or only small details. You could play Undertale a million times and you would always see some type of change or secret you didn't see before.\n\nThe characters are well created and you get attached to them as you play. I don't know how many times I started to cry or felt bad or sad about the choices I made whenever I reseted the game and started playing from the beginning again every time I finished it. It felt like I was seeing old friends again, even though they no longer remember me. Even now, after playing and finishing Undertale five times, I still laugh and smile at the actions of these characters when I see them make the same jokes as they did all the other times.\n\nAnother amazing aspect of the game is it's soundtrack. The music really sets the mood of the scene, weather you're simply at the shop buying supplies or fighting one of the bosses. You always feel the emotions that each song creates when it plays. It really makes you feel like you're the character in the game, not the one controling the character. There are even times I listen to some of the songs on the sountrack when I'm doing homework, and they always fill me with determination to finish it, no matter how late at night it is.\n\nI don't know about anyone else, but personally, I would love to see Toby Fox create a sequal to Undertale. I know if he did, I would buy it in an instant!","January 5","true","75.1"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","25","28","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/391540/","trar","Hammurabi of Babylon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/","318 products in account","Before I talk about this game, I'd like to say that receiving almost any advance knowledge of said game more or less destroys its magic. Its mystique, if you will. And this is a game that relies heavily on said mystique. You really wanna know what I think about it, but haven't actually played it yet, read until the first double spaced break. Capiche?\n\nPerhaps this little thing isn't a Final Fantasy game. It certainly doesn't quite have the length of one, even if you account for multiple playthroughs. And the graphics? They do a good job, but they're not exactly triple-A. (The music, at least, is truly top-notch. It helps that the developer is a music composer by trade.)\n\nNormally, I wouldn't even pay any mind to its Overwhelmingly Positive rating, with around 45,718 reviews as of my own review. Here's the thing, though: if a game isn't wowing so many people with its graphics, or its scope - and good music alone does not a good game make - there must be something to it. And that 'it' in Undertale's case is a whole lot of genuine heart, complimented by some actually good writing.\n\nThis is basically a JRPG for people who don't really like JRPGs, and I know this because I am one of those people. No matter where you stand on the JRPG-liking scale, I would advise you to at least try the demo[undertale.com]. It is, at the very least, something genuinely different, and it really does have heart.\n\n\nAs for the rest of the game? I dislike bullet hell even more, and the combat system comprising of mini bullet-hell games was nothing short of brilliant - at the very least better than the bog-standard 'select an attack, hold down the speed key in your emulator and watch stuff happen' system of other JRPGs.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Undertale gives you the choice of not killing any enemy you come across. Not unique, perhaps, but more elegantly implemented than any other game I've seen yet. Even an attempt at a pacifist run here counts for more than in some other games.\n\nTying into this, Undertale is the rare example of video game writing that isn't some value of bad or otherwise effortless/nondescript, a distinction that puts this game in the leagues of Alpha Centauri and Deus Ex for me. And screw every imageboard memer who hates it just because it's popular and not anime or a milsim. Undertale's writing isn't good because it manages to pull off speculative, philosophical hard sci-fi or just because it tells a rollicking tale of conspiracy and action with corny yet genuine voice acting. Undertale's writing...\n\n...made me laugh, and laugh with it, and I'm not a person who laughs with a game very often. It made me think, not only of the enemies I killed, but of the ones I killed in other games. It started sincere and only became more sincere the further I progressed, although it might have helped that I was invested early on. On my second playthrough, it started to actually kind of get to me. The most important aspect here, however, is the gameplay and story segregation.\n\nThere is almost none. In a genre where developers generally don't even care about that sort of thing.\n\nYou truly live with your choices here. This game's encyclopedic recall of the decisions you make and the enemies you kill, and the tight interlacing of the aesthetic with the gameplay in general, really do make this game stand out for me...and I've played a lot of games. Even if this isn't the Best Game Ever, it's absolutely one of the best games to come out of 2015, or at least the best one with an androgynous player character which I think is pretty neat either way.","January 30","true","22.5"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","29"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hellbeholder/recommended/391540/","Hellbeholder","Hellbeholder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hellbeholder/","426 products in account","Undertale is a game that came out of nowhere and captivated the hearts of many, MANY players, basicly over night. The fanbase is growing on a daily basis on every possible social and art platform, many would argue it's probably just a phenomenon or a tumblr hipster thing, but I can assure you, there is a reason for all of this hype.\n\nThe developers of Undertale dared a risky deal with this game design. You could believe that another retro-style indie game would've turned down by the community in an instant, but there is something important and fresh Undertale has in comparision to other recent games, even the big titles.\n\nHeart. Soul. And character.\n\nLet's break it down in an old fashioned pros/cons list.\n\nPros:\n\nTrue morality is something pretty rare in most games. You're the hero, killing the bad guys for the better cause, mowing through endless henchmen and evil dudes without a second thought. You're the reaper of evil!\nBut what if you could look behind the characters of those you've just slain...? Would you still feel good to kill a family father who was forced to do his evil deed? Undertale does exactly that.\nMurder is not fun. The game tells you from the very beginning, heck, even in the trailer, nobody has to die in this game. When you're attacking and killing, it's your choice to do so. And if you kill a character, even the monsters in random encounters, they're gone for good. Other characters will react to your murderous intentions. And all of these bad things will eventually haunt you even in new playthroughs. However, if you choose to be patient and nice, to spare your enemies and convience them to your side, you'll have way more fun on your adventure and gain new friends along the way.\n\n- Combat is pretty interesting in Undertale. Each encounter resembles a bullet hell shooter in some way, where you have to dodge hostile projectiles. Every enemy has multiple attack patterns which can be pretty surprising and hard at first, but they also resemble the mood of your enemy. Is the monster sleepy and slow, well, the attacks certainly will be easy to avoid.\n\n- For me, the music in this game is absolutly top notch, godlike, gold tier, fantastic! There are a lot of different songs for different situations and characters of course, most of them are upbeat and fun to listen to, the perfect rythm for the battles! When something get's emotional, the music will fit right in. But when the game needs to be dark, it can also be spooky.\n\n- The humor, of course, is something very subjective and can easily ruin the experience for you when you're not into it. For my part, I loved it. It had the right amount of cheesiness to still be entertaining, yet there were a lot of funny surprises in the dialogs.\n\n- The characters and writing are probably the best parts about this game. Everything and everybody has character to it, the writing is clever and emotional - and that's probably where the most popularity comes from for this game. If you're a person with a high level of empathy, you'll find yourself invested in an emotional and great story which has a lot more to it than you would imagine on the first look. And stuff like this is pretty dang rare in modern games. Due to the believablity of the characters, you become attached to them, root for them and when you befriend them and they start to root for you too, it starts to feel good. You start to feel determined.\n\nCons:\n\n- A lot of people are bashing the graphics of this game before even playing it. And you know what? They're right. The retro graphics might be charming, but pretty crude and inconsistent in Undertale. It's a wild mix of Atari style, 8 bit and 16 bit visuals. The environments you're wandering through don't have many details or are pretty in general (except the waterfall area maybe), enemy sprites are sometimes animated, sometimes they're not, this kind of inconsistency even appears with the boss monsters. The game might not be eyes-bleeding ugly, but it's certainly not pretty either.\n\n- Okay, let's be honest guys, the most gameplay aspects of this game are weak. With exception of the combat which is pretty entertaining for the most part, you're just running around and solving... "puzzles". But you can't call those things puzzles, they're minor obstacles that take a bit longer to overcome than simply running past it. The game in general is very simple and easy, calling it an actual RPG would be a pretty heavy exaggeration.\n\n- There is another thing that bugged me pretty hard in particular while playing the pacifist route. There is a certain battle in the game in which you have to fight, even it was a no-go the entire game up to this part. The entire journey you learned that attacking can be avoided with kindness and sparing but then you're forced to attack to progress in the battle. That kind of inconsistency was not really necessary and just felt bad.\n\n\nBUT these cons are minor nit-picks in comparison to the pros!!!\n\nEven if the game doesn't look that good, even if the gameplay is lackluster - You're not playing Undertale for those things. You're playing Undertale for the characters, the story, the emotions and the brilliant adventure!\n\nSo in conclusion, yes, the hype for this game is pretty much real. I can understand people who turned it down for the humor or because they couldn't be emotional invested with the story and characters (which is a shame) - Okay, fine.\nBut people who play this game for 10 minutes and ♥♥♥♥ all over it without giving it a chance disgust me. DISGUST me.\n\n\nHaving such a great gem of indie-game with an actual emotional experience among a load of AAA titles, which of developers certainly don't care anymore to polish even something crucial like performance -\n\nIt fills me with determination.","November 24, 2015","true","12.8"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","26","31","2","2"

Plus some players get overly obsessed with the game and try always bringing it up, converting everyone they talk to into playing it, etc... But hey! Every healthy community has those weirdos!\n\nDetailed, without spoilersOh boy, here we go.\nTo me it feels like everyone has heard about this game by now, but if you haven't - oh are you in luck, because this game truly is one of a kind gem that shines even brighter when played blind! Undertale is a singleplayer RPG that remembers your actions.\nThe artstyle is neat, deliberately simplistic and sometimes really cute. Reminds of good old early gaming era RPGs.\nThe game mechanics are rather simple and will be familiar to those oldschool RPG lovers. The main difference between this game and other RPGs is that you don't -have- to kill every monster you meet. Taking even this one simple notion into account, your entire playstyle may change drastically, leading you to different mid-game changes, and, of course, endings.\nThe music in Undertale combines 8bit and instrumental parts, is very well written, and greatly compliments the art and the story, making it into a whole brilliant work.\nOverall being a simple game, Undertale refers to older RPG games and up-to-date media, has its own unique traits and manages to touch on complex matters, making not the pixels you control, but you, the player himself, an active and responsible for his doings figure.\n\nDetailed, with spoilersAs someone who's determinately beaten the game three times and watched several playthroughs on top of that, I feel competent enough to write this review.\nThere are three general routes you can take in Undertale, and every one of them is worth going for. The neutral ending will make you WTF hard, the pacifist ending will make you really happy and possibly force you to shed a tear, and the genocide route will bring your self-esteem down to 0, then stomp on your heart and take your very soul for good measure.\nSo, I've got a question for you. What other computer games out there are able to do all this and more to you in a matter of several hours? The answer is - not too many of them, which makes Undertale such a treasure, my personal GOTY-2015 and a must-have for every modern player.\nAlright, here's a better question. Do you read the review just to get more opinions on this amazing game after having beaten it yourself to fill in that gaping void in your heart? Yes? I knew it.\n\n10/10, would have a bad time again.","January 17","true","30.8"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","26","31","5","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gardefag/recommended/391540/","gardefag","Miss Metalstar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gardefag/","170 products in account","There are hundreds of reviews for this game, and they'll all tell you the same thing: It's an amazing game.\nYes, it has a great atmosphere, excellent writing, world-building, and level design.\nYes, it has an amazing OST and characters you can really relate yourself to and become emotionally attatched to.\n\nBut that's not what did it for me with this game, instead of telling you why it's a good game, allow me to explain why I personally enjoyed my experience.\n\nA good friend of mine, someone I hold dear to my heart, recommended this game to me after he had played through it, me being a hipster, I kept saying I didn't want to play it. But eventually, I did give it a chance, and I'm so glad I did. I played it for an hour or two and I couldn't really get into it. Sure, I was enjoying it, but it was nothing special.\n\nSo he starts watching me play the game, he backseats a bit, we chat, we comment on the world and characters, we're having a really good time. He's there with me for all the embarrassing moments, all the bad moments, and all the good. Together we spent the next 6 or 7 hours doing a True Pacifist run, and I'll tell ya', if he wasn't there for me in all those significant moments of the game, it would have not felt the same. I would've been bored, I wouldn't have cared, I would've just played through. Maybe I'm tasteless, but having him there with me the whole time made the game feel so much more special to me; because of it, I had a blast. We had a blast.\n\nBefore I wrote this.. I was doing a genocide run with him, he watched me attempt Sans 28 times.. he cheered me on and on and when I finally beat Sans.. I felt so good, not only because Sans was hard, but because he was there with me, rooting for me and telling me he loves me.\n\nI'll always remember him telling me so often to stay "Determined", I feel like this game brought us closer to each other even if only slightly, and I love him, so I'm happy for that.\n\nI'm recommending this game not only because of it's kickass soundtrack, the variety, the "combat", or anything really. I can promise you, you've never played a game like this before. I know this review is more of an anecdote (an extremely corny one) than an actual review, but just read any other review and they'll tell you this game is amazing.\n\nI'm also recommending it because it inspired love, and it reinforced that love. Go buy this game for you and your significant other, play through it together and share your experiences.

There's always something fresh, yet unexpected around the corner. Toby Fox's attention to detail in this game is unbelievable. It's less of a game, and more of a adventure that can be enjoyed your way.\n\nThe soundtrack is inspired! The game was purchased for me, but I made sure to grab the soundtrack to both support Toby, and so I could listen to the beautiful music anywhere.\n\nUndertale is charming in a way that only two other games can hold a candle to: MOTHER 3 and Earthbound\n\nWhen I finished my first run of the game, I had interacted with everything, and enjoying every part of it. It had taken me about 17 hours from start to finish - And I'm doing another run of the game which makes the gameplay, story, and characters act completely different.\n\nThis $10 game had brought me more fun and entertainment than most $60 AAA games out there today.\nWhoever is on the fence about buying this game - GO FOR IT. You'll easily get your money's worth, and then some.\n\nAs the lovable trailer told us - You don't have to destroy anyone.","October 11, 2015","true","32.1"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","24","28","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/391540/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","Undertale is a wonderful fresh breath of air in the otherwise stale medium that is RPGs. In it, you play the role of a small child who falls down a pit into a world full of monsters. Your goal is to somehow find your way back to the surface world.\n\nOne of the unique things about this game is that you can beat the entire game without killing a single monster. To do this, you rely on a separate menu in combat (ACT) which gives you several actions you can perform to convince monsters not to fight you. Doing this for the entire game will net a special ending. Alternatively, you could get something completely different by slaughtering everything in your path.\n\nCombat itself is turn-based and easy to learn. When you attack, you get a small timing-based mini game that determines if/how hard you hit. The other unique feature of this game takes place when it is the monster’s turn to attack. Rather than simply rolling the dice and determining how much HP you lose, you get a “bullet hell” minigame where you must maneuver your soul (a heart) within the confines of a box, avoiding all the pellets/body parts/energy beams shot at you. Because of this, it is possible to “receive” attacks from monsters and take absolutely no damage at all as long as you are good enough to dodge everything.\n\nAs far as your actions go, characters remember what you do to them and little things you do early on can have an interesting impact on later encounters. It really feels like your choices matter as opposed to most other RPGs where you are “on rails” all the way to the end. The game is also chock full of cutesy humor as well as serious or disturbing imagery and manages to blend them together without leaning too far in any direction.\n\nUndertale shows a surprising amount of spit and polish for a retro-style game and shines in pretty much every category. The visual style and whimsical character design seems to borrow a lot from various games including Earthbound and Yume Nikki. I also noticed some other musical influence from the Ace Attorney series as well as a few other games. Again, all the references seem to just blend together perfectly without being too obvious.\n\nIf you like games that wander off the beaten path and shine in their own unique way, Undertale is probably right up your alley. Just remember to stay ‘determined’!","September 17, 2015","true","11.9"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SvartLiska/recommended/391540/","SvartLiska","SvartLiska","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SvartLiska/","144 products in account","Undertale is an RPG game that takes many cliché elements in RPG games and creates it into this new type of game in which, just as the description mentions, you do not have to harm a single soul.\n\nPROS:\n+ Unique type of gameplay\n+ Battles are unlike anything seen before\n+ Surprising elements (planned crashes, (non-harmful) game file issues, etc.)\n+ Many different characteristic entities, all with a very unique behavior\n+ Intriguing artwork\n+ Multiple "routes" and endings\n+ Great amount of soundtracks\n+ Trading cards with valuable crafting rewards\n\nCONS:\n- It's not really clear in some battles what you're supposed to do\n- The protagonist character is rather bland and randomly constructed. It doesn't feel satisfying to be the "normal guy" in what is best described as a world filled with a colorful mismash of vivid characters\n- A lot of the game and its areas and transitions make little to no sense\n- Not exactly story-driven, despite the title being UnderTALE. Rather a loose collection of character dialogues, jokes and interactions that eventually bring you to the end\n- The further you come in the game, the more it devolves into endless dialogues that really make you want to skip them (for example: the part where Alphys just keeps texting you over and over annoyed me greatly)\n- You don't do much else than walking around, interacting with characters and having battles\n\nUndertale is a pretty pioneering game when it comes to what we have seen in RPG games already. However, it's not exactly a game for everyone. If the humor didn't catch you, like it didn't with me, chances are you didn't enjoy the game altogether. Despite my generous rating for this game, because I feel that this game is certainly different than your average RPG, I did not enjoy this game a lot because the charm of it simply failed to capture me. Obviously it did click with other people. Even then, I still fail to understand how this game was dominating the gaming market for several months, and seemingly still raging on as I edit this review I typed months ago when the game's afterglow should've ended already.\n\nMy rating: 8/10 (read on for more information about this rating. Any more comments about this will get removed)\n\nEdit: I usually don't break character in my reviews, but I want to share a bit of the bad experiences I had with both the game and the mentality of the fanbase.\n\nI copied and pasted my review back after a mass fanboy downvoting parade flew over it. It's not really fair to sketch my review off as "not helpful," because I give both pros and cons and explain why I don't recommend it. I'm not saying the game is bad or shouldn't be played, but it's not my cup of tea either.\nI could also just write an awful joke or reference from the game here, like a lot of people do because the crowd deems it "hilarious," but that isn't helping anyone, but instead deprives people from helpful reviews that do help them getting an insight of what the game is like.\n\nThis game enforces some kind of idea that if you don't like the game, you will be found and treated like a heretic and your choice on videogames is suddenly bad. I mean look at the helpful/not helpful ratio of the negative reviews, while most "singular-line reviews" in the positive section have a 90+ percentage of being "helpful" (read: completely useless).\nI've seen some well-constructed "not recommended" reviews way better than mine being downvoted beyond belief. This kind of inability to witness people disliking something you love arose in some of my (former) friends and makes me feel like this game is mainly played by teenagers or people who find the hype of randomness and memes hilarious and can't at all take any negativity over it.\nSeriously, I have been told these exact words by someone I used to refer to as friend: "I know what's good for you better than you know yourself."\n\nOf course, if you don't see yourself in this, you shouldn't feel guilty.\nI'm not implying that you shouldn't downvote reviews that aren't going further than a few sentences, nor that you shouldn't voice your opinion over it, but instead encourage you to rate and argumentate fairly and considerate. Feel free to downvote mine too if it didn't give you insight or a different perspective. This is all besides the point of this review, but I'd like to have this addressed nevertheless. This seems to play a role in many reviews ever since Steam was invented, and it's a shame.","January 7","false","6.6"," 605 of 1,037 people (58%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","58","605","1","24","77"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/asrielasitgets/recommended/391540/","asrielasitgets","Asriel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/asrielasitgets/","19 products in account","So.. Undertale.\n\nThe basic synopsis of this game without giving anything away is that you fall down a hole to where monsteres reside, and you have to escape.\n\nBut the game is so much more than that.\n\nUndertale is an emotional joyride where you decide your fate, the fate of others and the world around you. At first, the game seems like a fun, silly new form of RPG which has nice characters, a fun story and gives you the choice with what to do with that, which is a great game alone, but then it becomes even better as you make your way to endgame. If you're looking for an emotional story over something more often seen in new releases, this game is definitely for you.\n\nAs said before, your choices effect the story. A lot. And before you go and relate this to something else such as "Life is Strange", which sure, allows your choice on what you do to affect small narratives, however none (other than one I can think of the top of my head) makes a significant difference. Looking back at Undertale, I can't think of one choice that wasn't funny to make, didn't affected the story line in a far more drastic way than you'd think or wasn't there for no reason at all.\n\nThe combat system is fairly unique, too. People may refer to this as an RPG, though the combat system seems minor compared to everyone else. Even if it isn't that important compared to the story or the choices you make, it can be fun or even challenging at times. In battle, you can do either 3 things, be merciful and spare or flee from them, maybe having to act a certain way for sparing to be possible, or fighting them. The choices you make in these battles are perhaps the most important when getting to the different types or endings, (and I say types as there are multiple endings in these different 'types' of endings), as 2 of them require only one type of way to get out of a battle.\n\nThe soundtrack for this game is, if I may say so myself, near perfect. Nearly every song spare one or two in my opinion is still catchy to listen to, even outside of the game, and if it isn't it fits beautifully with where it's set. The music alone gives a lot of emotions throughout the game - not much soundtracks which I've heard can create ambience, happiness, fear, laughter and determination as well as Undertale did.\n\nSome people may be put of by the graphics, but honestly, they don't really matter. Looking at the starting pictures, it doesn't look that great as a game but it makes use of what graphics it uses, dare I say, as well as the likes of Earthbound or Mother 3. Undertale is a game which, if it had better graphics or more detail, it could even be worse as a game - though if you still doubt me I recommend playing the demo (located at www.undertale.com).\n\nHonestly, theres a reason this game has so little unrecommendations compared to its positive reviews. Although I've been overwhelmingly positive on how much I love this game, it does have some downfalls. Some people find certain characters annoying, as they tend to speak a lot (which  makes playing the game over again a tad annoying once you've already known what they're going to say). I would go into more detail on some tidbits (and one major part which I found great, but when going back for more just seemed depressing) but I think most problems do fit well into the game and might even make the game worse without them.\n\nThe fandom is great and terrible in its own ways. The community loves the game, but to a point where some fans think it is the 'greatest game of all time to ever exist and that no game will ever live up to its standards therefore there is no point in playing other games at all, what're you doing with your life'. Although I think the game is definitely in my top 3 which I've ever played, there are a lot of games out there which are as good or even better than Undertale in my opinion. Other than this, the fandom actually has a lot to offer in terms of art (etc) which really helps fill the gap you get once it's over. I would suggest steering clear of the fandom until you beat the game, as the majority of the community could end up spoiling parts of the game unintentionally.\n\nIn conclusion, Undertale is a fun, classy, unique game mixed with a beautiful story, original characters and choices which matter to form the perfect game which it is. I recommend this game for anyone 12 and over, as it is more recommended for 'mature' audiences and perhaps a bit younger. I would rate this game a 10/10 - you really need to play this game. Don't even watch it on someones youtube channel, just buy it and play it. It's better to go in blind, the experience is something you won't be able to describe.","November 22, 2015","true","462.3"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","24","29","5","14"

I see the appeal of it and understand why some people like it but it's just not for me. If I'm being brutally honest, this games feels like its being aimed at highschool-aged kids who think it's so funny to be "random" and love memes. I'm not trying to be highbrow but the humor absolutely did not click with me. Aside from a chuckle or two, I found most of the humor pretty grating and swinging at low-hanging fruit. Because I didn't really like the writing, I found the characters to be much less endearing than many others.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, it does turn the genre on its ear by introducing the bullet hell-styled fights. Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of bullet hell games. I can appreciate the novelty and attempt at doing something different but like the writing, it just wasn't for me.\n\nStory-wise and emotionally, the game didn't really move the needle for me. I never got invested in the characters and overall the game simply did not click with me. I really am disappointed that I did not enjoy it because To the Moon and LISA are some of my favorite games, with the latter (in my mind) superior in every way the Undertale. If there's one thing I really did like it would be the music.\n\nI don't normally write negative reviews, but I wanted to for this game just in case there is someone who has the same tastes as I do and doesn't get swept up in the hype storm that is Undertale.\n\n**EDIT: Because people have asked, yes I beat the game on a true pacifist run.**","December 19, 2015","false","11.8"," 2,801 of 4,893 people (57%) found this review helpful 155 people found this review funny","57","801","4","155","477"

And to a certain extent, it is. HOWEVER, it far exceeded the expectations I've ever had for any indie title. While it lacks a shiny modern graphic design, it does not need it because it excels in every other aspect of its entity. The humorous dialogue stands equal to that of Earthbound's; the jokes were endless and, surprisingly, most of them were expertly delivered. New characters, unnamed and familiar, friend or foe, only added to the excitement and thrill of going onward. The music was completely addicting, the volume couldn't go high enough!  With a custom theme for each boss, it's the game that somehow keeps outdoing itself. The story and atmosphere was absorbing and could effectively set the tone of the game from whimsical and cheery to ominoius and spooky. The gameplay was fresh, new and truly something to be experienced in 'Pacifist Mode.'\nI thought this game was another overhyped indie title, nearly writing it off as 'Flavor of the Month,' but it truly delivered much more than I ever expected from a small-time developer.

There are no words to describe the masterpiece that is this game. Whether you're going down the surprisingly dark path that is the genocide run or embracing the pacifistic path, this is a game that will grab you by the heart and soul. Never once before have I actually cared about the NPC's in a game. Never once before have I gone down the evil road in a morally split game and actually, legitimately given up - not because of difficulty, but because I just felt so bad.\n\nAnd never, EVER before have I thought "I am willing to petition to ADD DLC to a game just to save one more character." To those who have seen the true ending to this game... you know who I'm talking about.\n\nIn an industry that is becoming more and more obsessed with war and violence, where murder is justified and revenge glorified, Undertale is a sharp, emotional, and unbelievably immersive contrast. For the first time in years, I have gone through a game and come out of it having learned something - not in an academic sense, but in a personal sense. So many games have tried to do this, to help the player develop as a person alongside the character, but this is the first time I have ever seen such a goal fully realized.\n\nUndertale isn't just a story about a land of monsters, it's about humans as well - showing that human nature and violence are not one in the same and that, given enough hope, effort, and determination, it is indeed possible to achieve peace. It is not an easy road, and often not even a road that some agree with, but it is still possible.\n\nIf you are looking for a fun and engaging game, buy Undertale. If you are looking for an incredibly emotional experience, buy Undertale. If you are looking for a story that will be not only memorable but inspirational, buy Undertale. If you have never, ever once played a video game and want to start off with the best possible experience to ever grace your screen, buy Undertale.\n\nYou may end up regretting HOW you play the game, but you will NEVER regret playing it.","November 21, 2015","true","8.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","16","19","2","2"

Most developers portray them as nothing more than fodder, but Undertale goes a step further by - if you play it right - having said enemies later show up in different areas you'd passed through earlier. They talk to you, say what's on their mind, maybe even flirt with you a little bit.\n\nThere is literally a tiny volcano who thinks her lava can heal people and tries SO hard to be helpful. The enemies have facial expressions and react to the things you say or do. The in-battle animations and their attacks all feel so personal. As someone I know said, it's like a combination of Cave Story, EarthBound, and The Stanley Parable with a heavy sprinkling of Touhou for good measure.\n\nThat said, the game isn't perfect. No game is, of course. The Genocide Route is understandly in stark contrast to the Pacifist or Neutral ways of playing. Instead of struggling to survive, the enemies fall like dominos. However, when they DO fight back.. it's not fun. At all. There are two fights I wound up having to get outside help with because I literally could not physically react in time. It was during those moments where I wondered just how much testing said fights were put through, or whether the developer had based it on their own skill - always a bad idea for one so intimately familiar with the game.\n\nOtherwise, the game is a blast and I've already completed it on Genocide, Pre-Pacifist and True Pacifist. The writing is absolutely magnificent and you DO feel awful when you play to kill. The music is easy to lose yourself in, as well. There is so much to see and do because of the minutia between the two ways of playing and the multiple ways of ending a neutral game.

I was swayed by the amount of hype and attention this piece got so quickly after release, I figured it was just a lot of nostalgia and over exaggeration.\n\nBut I finally played it and I have to say; while it might be over blown, it's not done so by a lot.\n\nA game like this comes along once in a generation. One with enough soul that it demands you love it. (Even if you suck at it, like me) Few games ever have any kind of morality system. Even fewer question the morality of the very basis of their own mechanics. (Spec Ops comes to mind) But Undertale asks the questions; is it right to kill an enemy in a video game? Could you talk it out instead? If so, why not?\n\nThe amount of meta this game digs into might not be 'original' but it's certainly a refreshing change of pace. Not every choice you make is completely clear as to what it will do and the actual gameplay segments can feel a bit clunky, mainly due in large part to the slow amount of movement you're allowed during your dodge phases. The only real issue this game suffers from is that it's simply not enough. Too short and too lacking in all the amazing characterization it has, it's asking for an expansion or a sequel or something. One playthrough isn't enough to sate most people's taste for the amazing world laid out in Undertale, and playing through it has lead me to understand why. There's too much to drink in and not enough game to hold it. (Not enough hours in the day as they say)\n\nOther than that though -- I have 0 complaints about this game. It's simply incredible. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, you'll get mad in frustration and cheer in victory as you finally win against that boss you've been stuck on for 3 hours. The music is amazing, the overall feel pulls you into the world and makes you a part of it and it's all done with sprites and pixel art, and sometimes literally, through the meta games.\n\nI really had to think it over since I didn't even give Far Cry 3 a full 10 due to it simply falling short in terms of gameplay stability. And I feel I should do the same for Undertale, but I don't think I will.\n\nSo for the first time ever in a *serious* review, I have to give Undertale a full 10/10 for its story and writing alone.\n\nHats off to you Toby.","December 23, 2015","true","30.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

In fact, it is so good that I decided to write a review for it right away; I have not even completed it yet. First off, I have to say that the game has an absolutely amazing soundtrack. Some of the music is so catchy that I simply cannot get it out of my head. The story is very immersive and full of humorous elements. The great thing about Undertale is that you are free to do as you please. The game does give you a basic idea of what you should do, but you don't have to follow the rules! You are presented with many choices, and it is entirely up to you how you decide to handle them. I have had a great time so far, and I know it will only get better from here.","November 30, 2015","true","24.2"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jaffersin/recommended/391540/","Jaffersin","Sippy Splips","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jaffersin/","498 products in account","Edit: I've at this point done the two most "polarized" playthroughs and watched some runs of middle-ground ones, I haven't really found anything in either that I feel changes things significantly enough to change the review content much past making this disclaimer.\n\n\nWhat kills me about Undertale is that it's hard to review. It's hard to review here, it's hard to review anywhere a numerical rating system is employed, to say nothing of a binary one. First and foremost, if there was an option to place this in a more gray area in terms of ratings, I'd absolutely do so. Undertale has a lot of heart and effort put into it, but as of writing this there's at least three hundred people who here who could've told you that. I've followed this game since the demo and have all the love and respect in the world for devs like Toby and what they do. If anything, they're role models who I dream of emulating one day and making my own work that can be so impactful. Hopefully, with that all said, I've made my intent clear enough to lower the  pitchforks and torches long enough to plea my case here. I've decided against trying to categorize anything here as good or bad, because the thing is that many features could be virtues or flaws depending on the individual.\n\nThe Basics\nThe ratio of dollars to hours is a little shaky, if that's a big selling point for you. I just narrowly broke even after doing a completionist run of (assumedly) the best ending.\nI experienced no crashes nor bugs, at worst I saw exactly one spelling error, which I'm sure could be taken care of hastily, so in those terms, very professional quality standard overall.\nIf you can help it, absolutely do NOT use a guide. Undertale is an experience, your first playthrough at least should be as fresh and genuine as you can make it. Figuring out what choices do and don't have this or that impact will greatly take away from a game designed to pick your brain and make you feel.\nIf you played the demo and loved it, stop reading here, you're gonna love the full game unless you're an anhedonic husk like me.  Aesthetic\nMusic averages out with a "pretty damn good" by my poor tastes. Some overworld themes were forgettable but overall I'd say there's enough tracks to listen to over and over again to justify buying the soundtrack, there's more than enough standout songs here to keep it from a one-hit-wonder, though maybe given the team credentials this is no surprise.\nSound choice is cute, charming, for the most part nothing overstays its welcome.\nVisuals are clean, even in a world of oddities as these you won't have much trouble working out what you see at any time. Though a few overworld maps get a bit dull and repetitive where this game absolutely shines is character sprites. Few other places will you find such a fine middle ground between simplicity and expressiveness.  Story and Gameplay\nThe main hook, a large feature of the game is that while you're free to savescum with your single file the game has a second, persistent ambiguous data cluster it saves and keeps track of behind your back. While the original demo touted this feature heavily it becomes a little played out now, especially since it's used commonly to little effect, making the times it does matter far less surprising. Sometimes this means skipping cutscenes in cleverly written ways, though, so you could say it balances as a bunch of neutrals and a few positives.\nIt has an un-game feature of sorts where it loves to bait you into following old instincts based on patterns and tropes in other games then pulling the rug out from under you. It's clever. At first. If there comes to be a point when you just get burnt out on opening snake-filled peanut cans then even when the bait-and-switch is unexpected you'll be too far gone to care.\nYou absolutely positively need to be invested in most to all of the recurring cast. You're gonna see a lot of these guys, and if you find some or another element of their personality annoying you're gonna have a bat time, mate. This might be a clever metaphor for something since I had to pretend to care about a handful of monsters who had me gritting my teeth at their every appearance if I wanted to get the good ending. For me, this was a rather large hangup as the game will depend largely at your attachment to the characters.\nUnless you're coming in almost 100% blind you'll be doing the most pacifist run you can. Unfortunately, this means just slightly less repetition than the violent route. Common enemies are almost always "check actions menu, do the nice one, mercy next turn" while bosses go "do one or two simple actions and then just stall out for a dozen or so turns until the boss is done talking".  This can be a little problem when the best parts of a boss battle are the music and imagining my Gandhi-Madotsuki-Jaundice-Baby ducking and weaving through flurries of blows.\nOffsetting the "attacking" (or lack thereof) being bland it certainly makes up for it in the "defending" portions. A sprinkle of Dragon Quest flavor and some bullet hell mixed with really unique and appealing patterns made for some interesting conflicts, though the thrill was dampened by common enemies being a nusciance to clear out as fast as possible or boss battles dragging on and having you weave minute variations of the same attack.\nFor a game that should know how deadset you are on not killing, it really doesn't do you any favors. Too many things result in items and equipment you won't much need. In total I bought one anti-weapon, found better armor and slowly came to realize I had no more item management to do other than the rare event of spending my not-fighting-money on healing items.  Overview\nA lot of people are gonna tell you Undertale is perfect, charming, touching, and I just wanted to say that I love what these devs do, but this game is some of those things, none of the other things and subjectively other things. I don't think my hu-man shell has the capacity for cynicism to say that the kickstarter cash investment and time taken didn't shell out nicely and fairly reflect Toby putting it to good use, but I also can't say that it's without flaws, flaws that might ruin an experience for you even if you came in wanting to play it and love it. What I can say is that it's the best kind of game for success. If you're already sold on it, you buy it. If you're unsure though, I can't say what kind of person would or wouldn't like it. I can only say you need to experience it yourself and I'll be damned if that isn't something special.\n\nMaybe as a whole I didn't like the full version, but I hope, pray, I'll be the narrowest of minorities on that.\nUndertale will give you a warm smile.\nUndertale will give you flowers.\nand you will cry.\n[1/4/16: Updated to try and improve spelling, grammar, syntax, etc. From here on I won't note such changes unless the content of the review is changed.]","September 16, 2015","false","17.1"," 2,436 of 4,429 people (55%) found this review helpful 166 people found this review funny","55","436","4","166","182"

The music/soundtrack is fantastic and catchy with plenty of songs for your enjoyment and the story is great with all of it's charm and humor from the characters, settings, and ending(s).

IS AWESOME, that being said, you can accidentaly play a playthrough were the plot wont be that good (the "bad" ending) in wich there is not that much story and what is there is mostly for people that are replaying the game, so be sure to play the game several times i am currently during my 5th playthrough and i plan on playing again after i finish it, the gameplay, at a first glance it might look like your typical earthbound like rpg and it kind of is... but with some twist, the battles are done by timing your attack, the best you time is the more damage  you do... now the enemy attacs are really interesting, they present itself like it would be on a shoot' em up or a bullet hell kind of game (like touhou games) and it is quite unique and quite challenging some times, thats not all of it there are some enemies that will change this patern again and again during the development of the game, so you wont get bored of it... but there is also another twist on the gameplay you dont need to fight, as the game proudly tells you on the store, you dont have to destroy anyone and i mean ANYONE it doesnt matter how much it looks like you have there is allways a peacfull way out and there is where most of the charm of the games shine, i will expand more on this later, now the music and sound design it is also great you every song is carefully crafted and it fits perectly to whats happening on the game, the sound effects are also good and quite charming (the sound of despair coming out from a broken bike is an example). Now graphics... having in mind that this is a game with 8 bits-like graphics i can say that there are also great, each sprite is well designed and have ton of details, and if not, the minimlistic style fits perfectly what is hapening, now one of the best things if not the best about this game are the characters, every single one is awesome, and loveable and unique and i mean everyone even the most unrelevant characters are charming... you have to make sure to check them and to talk to them and to do everything you can, i cant pick a favorite character i just cant, i love every single one of them. and also i said that the game shines when you choose the peacefull way out and this is because of the characters, when you forgive every single one you are basically making them realice what they are doing or you help them know themselves better, and you are rewarded with really interesting dialogues.\n\n\nToby Fox, thanks, i love you and i love undertale\n\ni hardly can say anything bad about the game to be honest... it has a GREAT sense of humor, the story is great, it has a HUGE replayabilty, the characters are lovable, the gameplay is great, the graphics and the sound/music is great too, i have to think hardly about something bad about the game but if i have to say one "bad" thing about the game is that you can not erase what you do most of the times what i mean by that is that if you kill someone and then repent and load a previous save or restart the game, the game remembers, no matter if you didnt save the game (almost) allways remember, the only thing you can do to really restart the game is by erasing the steam folders that have the data of the game.\n\ni also want to highlight that the game is FULL of secrets, some of wich i am sure are still to be uncover but rest asure the greatly active fanbase will found them all someday i am sure ;)\n\nmy score i think is an obvious 10/10 (during my first playthrough i said my score was 9-9.7 but after playing it again i have to give it a perfect score kudos toby fox and thanks for so much)","October 17, 2015","true","51.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","1"

It opens your eyes to either the true innocence of a child or pure evil of an unpure soul. There are multiple ways the game can play out and every action you choose to make can cause different gameplay results.\nOverall, the puzzles are confusing at times but never too hard, the characters are simply lovable, the story is very well and cleverly pieced together, and there are multiple secrets and things to discover.

That's fine, I don't blame ya.\n\nI do dare anyone who plays it to say it wasn't an interesting (and touching) experience, no matter what type of gamer or person you are. So there you go. Play it, judge it for yourself, and then shut up about it forever if you don't like bandwagoning.\n\nI hate doing such a circumstantial review that has more about the fandom than the game, but hopefully it's functional and draws in people, because this really needs to be addressed: far too many people are dismissing this as "overrated" by just seeing the fandom, and it's a feeling I totally understand, but for the love of God, don't let it stop you from playing this game. I mean come on, what are you, a 14 years old that just found out about contrarianism?\n\nThe other reason for the review not being much about the game is because of something you definitely already heard a million times: it's one of those games where the experience is better if you go there without knowing anything about it.\n\nUsually, I'm not for this kind of argument: the whole concept of "spoilers" annoys me, because it implies that you can ruin something by simply giving someone a piece of information, as if to say that the highest value of that something resided in merely shock value and not within the journey to get to whichever event was spoiled... however, I must say that in this case the "blind experience" is at least heavily tied to the nature of the game. Not that the experience would be bad without it, but it would be extremely enhanced with it.\n\nAnyway, if you really want to go in it knowing at least something about the gameplay and want to have an idea of what to expect and to see if it might be your kinda thing, here it comes, but beware: it's almost secondary to what this game is about.\n\nThe game is an earthbound-styled JRPG that manages to make the old-school battle system of such games (in my opinion, a bit obsolete) way more bearable by making it about timing/rhytm when you attack, and bullet-hell-like when you are attacked. You also have the choice to not fight and have enemies not fight you by using diplomacy, which is usually arbitrary commands to be performed in a certain order to convince them to stop fighting.\n\nNo, the peaceful playthrough mechanic is NOT complex dialogue choices nor complex at all, it's just picking an option and reading some flavor text until you get it right.\n\nNo, the fighting itself is not hard: the game is extremely easy, save for two major exceptions that are extremely hard and are locked behind a lot of farming.\n\nSo yeah, if you look at this from a gameplay-perspective, you might find it not appealing, but I warned you: there's something more to this game, and there are precise reasons behind all of those game-design choices.\n\nAlso yeah it's very good. Subverts the player's expectations consistently enough and has enough details to keep you entertained even after your first playthroughs.","March 16","true","36.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","10","10","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/recommended/391540/","loveandpeace","sigh of dog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/","809 products in account","*edit in December 2015*\nI originally reviewed this game in September, when it had freshly launched and I had just played it.  It was a quick, silly, premature review, but it got the point across well enough, so I'm keeping it there; but I wanted to update this a bit to more fully reflect what this game means to me.\n\nThis is not just your average flash-in-the-pan popular-for-a-month "quirky indie game", like some people seem to be assuming.  This is not a game that just affected everyone for a moment but will be forgotten tomorrow.  Two and a half months later and it's still just as profoundly stuck with everyone I know who's played it, in most cases even moreso than before, as things have settled and we've really had time to think about the game and what makes it so great.\n\nUndertale quite simply has more heart put into it than any game I can think of.  Every inch of the game is saturated with so many secrets, easter eggs, wonderful little touches, and signs of the love and care put into the whole package.  Every single character, especially the major ones, are so well-designed... the dialogue is so on-point at all times, with immeasurable mountains of optional dialogue you'd have to play through the game dozens of times to see all of... the graphics a simple but charming, and the music is unforgettable.  Most of all, though, the game makes you feel emotions.  Strongly.  I mean running the whole gamut of them, too, even if you just go down one story route.  Everything is just so well-done, and even moreso in retrospect after you play the game, look back weeks or months later and realize just how phenomenal it all really was.\n\nToby is modest to a fault about all this, and some fans are indeed perhaps a bit overly enthusiastic -- but there is a reason this game has gotten as much attention as it has.  There is a reason it's become so beloved.\n\nSuccinctly put, it's my favorite game of all time now.  I say this in confidence after months of letting everything sink in; it has officially dethroned Chrono Trigger, after 20 years, as my very favorite video game.  So... yeah.\n\n(original review below this line)\n----\n\nI wanted to wait until I finished it to review this game, but I honestly can't.\n\nNo, really.  I rarely feel like playing any game for more than a couple hours at a time anymore; I always have things on my mind, other things I think of that I should or could be doing -- even the absolute best games, even ones I consider favorites, can't keep me hooked and unwilling to move from my seat like this one already has, from the very beginning.  Every single save point I thought, "Maybe I'll take a break now... nahh, just a bit more...." and was glad I stayed.  It starts out strange but intriguing, and just gets better and better and better.  I don't even care if the rest of the game ended up being trash, I'd still recommend it as the first few hours are absolutely more than worth the miniscule asking price.\n\nIt's unlike anything else.  It's just too good.  Buy it.\n\n*edit after finishing it, via the true good ending* BUY IT.\nBUY IT.  AND A COPY FOR EVERYONE YOU KNOW.","September 23, 2015","true","46.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","1"

It, rightfully, prides itself on being the first RPG where nobody needs to die, you can either kill or spare the enemies you encounter along your journey and it forges the storyline according to your actions.\n\nThe good:\n\n+The memorable characters have all (Except for the main protagonist) very distinct personalities. Quirks, kinks and traits that make them enjoyable to either fight or/and befriend.\n+It breaks the 4th wall constantly, and does so in a manner that the Deadpool game could only hope to be.\n+There is good replay value to be had here, due to its multiple endings, new lines of dialogue and scenes that you’ll unlock if you decide to do a new run after completing it.\n+The overall retro look of the game is delightful and so are the character designs and sublime soundtrack.\n\nAs for the bad:\n\n-The game is extremely naive and idealistic and, more often than not, all the choices you make boil down to either "be a good boy" or "be a psycho".\n-Subsequent playthroughs can become a bit tedious.\n-It's pretty short (About 5 to 7 hours, depending on the kind of run you're aiming for)\n\nConclusion:\n\nUndertale is charming, it’s emotive, it’s scary, it’s challenging… It’s good. In short, I fell in love with this one!\nGuaranteed to either exfoliate the most calloused of hearts... or make them snap.\n\nCreator of Undertale, Toby Fox, said that adding achievements would be contrary to the spirit of the game, and that he didn’t want to encourage the player to do any particular actions, which, in my opinion, was a great decision for him to make. Yet, I think it would be a good idea to have them, just so you can check which users have done genocide runs and, ultimately, avoid such people.","December 1, 2015","true","17.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

These games had it all and thus left a big impression on me and rank very high among my favorite games of all time.\n\nUndertale managed to do the same for me. It stays true to the spirit of these games but at the same time it does something new: It messes around with your experiences, your expectations and parodies the core elements and clichés of the genre whereever it possibly can.\n\nA little warning on that note: The humor is not for everyone. I'd describe it as random, meta and often rather blunt. I often couldn't really believe what just was happening on my screen. If you can't stand these kind of jokes you won't enjoy the game. Just read the game key features on the store page and have a look at the kickstarter video and you get the idea.\n\n√ awesome pixel artstyle\n√ great world design\n√ hilarious and lovable character design\n√ turn based fighting system with minigames and non-lethal option\n√ your playstyle and actions have consequences and have the power to alter the game and further events heavily\n√ small and fun puzzles to solve\n√ appealing story with a lot of unexpected events and twists\n√ masterpiece of a soundtrack *sample*\n√ great sense of humor, doesn't take itself too serious\n√ 3 possible endings with alternate versions based on your actions\n\n× only one save slot\nx rather short game with ~7 hours\n\nConclusion:\n\nI recommend Undertale to everyone who is a fan of the good old-fashioned RPGs of the SNES-era but doesn't expect a 100% serious game and can take a lot of jokes.","January 5","true","10.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

Or neutral. I refuse to outright hurt any of these monsters. You know you have a good game when it physically pains the player to betray a fictional character's friendship by murdering them for your own curiosity.\n\nI'm not even kidding, this game pulled me out of an extremely bad rut in my life where I was just kind of bored of everything and didn't put much effort into anything I did anymore. Semi-depressed, I guess.\n\nAnyway-- The way these characters, interactions and environments (and hell even the music) make you feel is on a whole new level of good storytelling. It will envelop you and make you feel as though you are the human, personally befriending all of these weird monsters.\n\nI never thought a random RPG that popped up randomly after I saw some fanart of it could suddenly shoot up to being my favorite game of the year, possibly of all time.\n\nIt's an experience you absolutely have to take on for yourself.

The good thing about this game however is all of the different endings you can get, so I will definitely play this game again just to get all of the different endings. Not only are there different endings, but there are also different "routes", depending on how you decide to play. UNDERTALE does have some replayability, which is great.\n\nIf you're unsure if you should buy this game or not, you can download a free demo from undertale.com. The demo introduces you to the start of the game and it will show you what to expect when it comes to puzzles and combat. However, to put it short, if you like RPG games that are in a similar style to the MOTHER series (Earthbound), then you will most certainly love this game. I know I did. This game has the same funny writing and unexpected plot twists like MOTHER, it's very well put together overall.\n\nThis is probably my new favorite indie game out there, and I am glad I got to hear about it. All of the support and praise this game gets is well deserved, and you should try it out. Seriously though, try the demo at least, don't let this game pass you by.

It's exceptionally good at tugging on your heartstrings, and the amount of effort put into every detail of its development is equally stunning. I get the impression that whoever designed it was really enjoying themselves, and their good feelings are infectious.\n\nIt's also hard not to draw a parallel to Earthbound/Mother 2, an old classic from the Super Nintendo generation. Much like Earthbound, Undertale lets the mechanics take a backseat and focuses on creating a mysterious world for you to explore and charming characters to meet and influence in different ways. You are given the option of playing as a pacifist or a killer, but given the sympathetic portrayal of every monster that you encounter (and the frankly primitive combat system), only an unconditional sadist would select the latter.\n\nUndertale is a game of mystery and wonder, never content with any particular circumstance and flipping every expectation you can think of on its head. Make no mistake, you are going to feel manipulated and played for a fool. There will be times where you are simply left scratching your head about the insanity of it all. But for an Undertale fan, that too is part of the charm. This is a game unlike any other, an otherworldly thing that defies explanation. It will be surely talked about for many years to come as its secrets are gradually peeled away like the layers of an onion. Should you will it, you can join in and help unravel the mysteries with the rest of us. I can tell that you have the DETERMINATION.","September 20, 2015","true","15.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

It's so different from everything else we're used to, I don't even know how to explain properly what it is that makes it so brilliant without spoiling it. I strongly recommend it to every gamer, because it's really one of a kind and the experience is unforgettable.\n\nLet me just say this game is an absolutely perfect mix of a very unusual concept for an RPG game, absurd humour, brilliant storytelling, amazingly charming characters, player's high involvement in the fate of the world and an unusual way of making the 4th wall completely inexistent, because things that would normally be a game mechanic are a part of the world in some way too. And the (good) ending is extremely satisfying and will just make you feel great.\n\nI can't explain it any better... You just have to trust me.

Undertale is also full of many charming characters with charming dialogue that will constantly keep you smiling. The soundtrack only helps add to the charm with very catchy melodies that always suit the situations within the game.\n\nDon't let the retro graphics fool you.

You owe it to yourself to find out what all the fuss is about, and it's probably best to dive in without any spoilers, or even clues on what to expect, so read ahead with caution.\n\nSimply put, this is one of the most consistently funny, touching, surprising, shocking, charming, unpredictable, disturbing and overall memorable games made in years. It's ambitious but simple in design, taking basic, old-school mechanics and twisting them around a little to make it its own unique thing. That alone would make it worth a visit for nostalgic rpg fans, but where it goes so much further is in the way it bends and then utterly shatters its own rules, creating a colourful, branching story that's compelling enough on the surface and then outright mind-bending as you delve deeper into its layered meta-narrative. While I hesitate to even hint at anything that might spoil it, I'll at least say that this game has both made me laugh and terrified me more than anything else has in a long time.\n\nWhile there's a lot to enjoy for anyone who likes games, the ideal target audience is an experienced gamer who's been playing since the NES/SNES era, given the partial reliance on nostalgia for some of its charm. It's a game that's very self-aware and fully indulges itself in pointing out its own use of gaming tropes and cliches, but it's a lot more clever than just  calling them silly and moving in. The deconstruction of games and the common gamer is a central theme to the overall plot and it has a lot to say about you, the player, and how you you play it. These moments range from clever little meta-jokes to sheer horror over your actions and creates an unsettling sense of overall paranoia whenever you do anything.\n\nThe breakdown of so many common aspects of RPGs and games in general work so well because they're not just jokes, but central plot devices and everything in-universe works on its own even with all the meta twists going on. It's not just a matter of pointing to a gaming cliche and going "hey look guys isn't this dumb" but it's actually a very effectively analytical breakdown of games and why we play them. But before you dismiss it as a pretentious "art" game, it also happens to be a very well-written and funny game that hardly takes itself seriously in the slightest despite it all.\n\nThat a game can be so whimsical and funny on the surface and so clever and mind-bending beneath really just makes it a success on every single level. Much like many other landmark indie titles of the past, I can picture this one having a lot of influence on titles to come, but nothing could ever truly capture what this one accomplished again. It's a once-in-a-generation kind of game and you won't ever play anything like it again. While I hate to rush to such conclusions as calling it my favourite game ever so soon after completing it, that was my immediate first instinct upon reaching the ending I was shooting for.\n\nSo play it. And remember:\nI'll be watching","October 1, 2015","true","11.4"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","14","20","2","0"

It's mentioned by several other reviewers and it's quite obvious (because it's perfectly acceptable to post a negative review that just says "stop reading negative reviews and buy this game!" which recieves almost 100% upvotes, clearly not being upvoted by people who are deciding whether or not to buy the game). The original review had 9 downvotes out of 10 votes as of writing this, and I'm under the assumption that users are just clicking negative reviews on the store and downvoting all of them :(\n\nThis game looked and sounded really fun (plus the insanely high positive rating of 98% [when I bought it] made it sound like the best game this year! )\n\nWhat I ended up getting was almost a visual novel. There's so little gameplay! The puzzles are easy and the combat is nothing more than pressing A at the right time, and then moving a heart-pointer to dodge other objects.\n\nThe humor becomes stale and repetive fast. A lot of the jokes remind me of the stuff you tend to see from Tumblr, and it's just not funny to me (I have nothing against Tumblr, it just reminds of it.)\n\nWhat else is repetitive is the music, which is basically just 8-bit tunes that loop (Edit: Yes, I dislike the music. It's just personal preference. I'm not a fan of chiptunes and beeps and boops and whatever else the music is. I obviously didn't play enough of the game to really experience it, but I'm also not a fan of music from the NES era or anything like that.)\n\nPros:\n•Retro style\n•Easy and laidback, doesn't require any effort to play (that's not taking a stab at it, I mean it doesn't require you to be sitting at a desk, you can run it on a tablet and use a controller and just chill out!)\n•Small file size (only around 100mb)\n\nCons:\n•Gameplay is basically just walking and clicking (I know it's an RPG but it's really bare-bones... skeleton puns heh. As for the easy and laidback comment: it's good in that regard but otherwise, too simple)\n•It wouldn't take long to want to stop replaying it (you can only take so many different paths)\n•The music... and basically everything else begins to feel repetitive pretty fast.\n\nI know this game is really popular! But it simply didn't click with me and that's why I got a refund. I really wanted to like this game but it just didn't happen. Personally, I feel like the game at $10 is too much.\n\nThe Undertale fanbase is a lot like the Minions fanbase. You either love it or hate it, but even if you hate it you can expect to have it shoved in your face all day long by the fanbase who don't understand that some people might think it's stupid.\n\n(tl;dr: not a lot of actual gameplay, very repetitive, jokes weren't funny to me, it looked good when I bought it but the actual game was, quite simply, boring.)\n\nEDIT: Yes I played 1.4 hours. No I will not begin to enjoy the game after buying it again and playing the story a certain way or by playing the whole game. If I disliked the first hour I'm certainly not going to enjoy the last hour! If you think commenting that I've only played 1.4 hours is clever, ask how it worked out for the 100 people to leave the exact same comment before you.","October 30, 2015","false","1.4"," 2,412 of 4,518 people (53%) found this review helpful 305 people found this review funny","53","412","4","305","523"

Well, this is one of those games that you really can't judge by it's cover. It's got so much more to it than what's present on the store page.\n\nWithout spoiling much, this game has it all; humor, drama, unique elements, engaging gameplay, true fear, a fascinating world, great soundtrack, and of course a lasting impact. This game is so good. Every character is dynamic and enjoyable, even the enemy NPC's! Every character in the game can be interacted with, and your actions affect not only the story but the way the game itself feels. It also somehow manages to really shift one's view of the game at points if played blindly, and oftentimes makes players wonder "what if I did things differently?". The developer had a lot of foresight and seemed to know how players would think and work in certain scenarios, so props to him for that.\n\nGameplay and story and constantly integrated in such a smooth way that every battle feels like a puzzle, or an entirely new game, and you'll never feel tired or frustrated during any point in the game. Without saying much, this game goes out of its way to make you feel like a true part of the story, and it's something that I've yet to see any game pull off in such a powerful way.\n\nThe difference between this game and standard RPGs is that, to avoid attacks, you must endure a SMALL bullet-hell sequence rather than simply having high stats and praying for RNG. I like this difference as it means you have to actually get good at the game rather than simply grinding for better stats.\n\nIf you enjoy RPG's, a great story, great gameplay, multiple endings or just a damn well polished good game. it's a must have.\n\n10/10 It is truly a unique masterpiece\n\n☟✌✞☜ ✡⚐🕆 ☜✞☜☼ ❄☼✋☜👎 ❄⚐ ☜✌❄ ✌ 👍☹⚐👍😐✍\n✋❄🕯💧 ✞☜☼✡ ❄✋💣☜📫👍⚐☠💧🕆💣✋☠☝✏","March 22","true","31.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

But even if you haven't, it has so much to give. Undertale toys with your expectations, not just in plot, not just in game mechanics, not just in level design, but even all the way down to fundamental nuts and bolts of how games work. Undertale delights with clever subversions left and right, and a combat system that lets you fight your way through without ever hurting anyone.\n\nIt *sounds* gimmicky, but Undertale's pacifism isn't for chumps. Sure, you might get some easy encounters where you compliment a frog and go on your way, but lots of encounters function as a little puzzle -- you have to know about your opponent's wants, needs, fears, hopes, etc., and choose your actions along a multi-step process to earn their trust. And since you still have to live through the bullet-hell defensive portions, it's honestly a more engaging game to go peaceful anyway.\n\nThat said, you'll probably take the path of violence eventually. You have to, right? Just to see what happens. Just to assert that you *can*. Well.... Undertale will let you do that. You want to kill everything that lives? Go for it buddy. But don't be surprised to find that actions have consequences, and that those consequences might reach further than you think.","January 7","true","16.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/recommended/391540/","vallinek","Vallinek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/","82 products in account","Oh boy. Where do I even start with this one? So much to talk about.\n\nUndertale is an RPG game with bullet hell elements. You control a child who fell down from a hole in the mountain, far down into the Underground, where all monsters were exiled after they lost the war with humans. You journey through to the barrier that separates both worlds, meeting and fighting many interesting, weird, or downright wacky characters along your way. Ultimately it is up to you whether you will spare their lives... or kill them.\n\nThe game is obviously holding a simple 8-bit style for the most part, but it isn't afraid to drop it when needed. It's all pretty to look at despite its simplicity, but that's not what I would call the best part of the game.\n\nMusic. Almost every single piece composed for this game feels unique, done in its own style, blending perfectly into the current scenery or what's happening on the screen, giving an incredible effect. Just try to walk through the Waterfall without stopping for a moment to listen to the music. Or just downright doing nothing during a boss fight for the same reason.\n\nThe story is, for the lack of originality and better words, amazing. Depending on which path you take, you will feel a whole plethora of emotions as it progresses. You will laugh. You will cry. You will feel DETERMINED to keep on going.\n\nFinally, the gameplay. You can explore the locations in your usual RPG fashion, and you enter a turn-based RPG-style battle when a random encounter happens. However, unlike in other games, during the monster's turn you will be thrown onto a field, controlling a red heart (called your SOUL), dodging enemy projectiles and attacks. This gives it some skill-based value and keeps it interesting - you can potentially avoid taking damage entirely if you're good enough. I will refrain from making remarks about its difficulty, as someone well-versed in bullet hell shmups, the game was rather easy for me personally. (I died maybe once or twice over the course of the whole game.)\n\nBut what the most important is, it's like there isn't exactly a fourth wall here. The gameplay rules are being altered to fit what is going on the screen at that moment. The game knows when you die and reload a save and will call you out on it. It's ready to mess with you at every occassion, making it sort of unpredictable. And so interesting.\n\nMy only complaint with the game is that it's a tad bit short. Your first playthrough will most likely be completed in less than 10 hours. I don't mind short games though, especially if it's something as great as this one.\n\nI recommend this game... no, you HAVE to play it. There's no excuse. The game is everything that was great and even more about the old RPGs. This is an unforgettable adventure of your life.","November 10, 2015","true","9.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","9","11","3","8"

At first, I was pretty bored playing it. Then, my beloved Goat Mom started acting suspicious. I followed, like anyone else. I fought her. At first, I accidently killed her. I thought it was fine, so I made it all the way to the Royal Guards in Hotland. I told my friend, and she said "Dude! You have to do pacifist run first! It changes the whole game!" I got scared, then decided to reset my game. I went through the game again, sparing Toriel this time. I legit ♥♥♥♥ my pants when Flowey recognized my mistakes. I knew there was something up with this game. I played through again, spending more time with the random encounters than I used to. I wasn't deep into the fandom until I got to Alphys a second time. I discovered all the great things the fandom made, and now I'm so glad I found it. I got to Asgore, and honestly got a bit nervous. When he destroyed "MERCY," I gasped. I defeated him, and let out a sigh of relief when his health got to a sliver. I yelled when he was killed. Then, I met my old enemy, Flowey. I cursed his name, and got scared when the game crashed. I slowly loaded back the game, and noticed something was wrong. I got scared when I heard the eerie tune of Omega Flowey. I saw the outline, and ♥♥♥♥ my pants a second time. I have been defeated twice, both times crashing my game. I haven't tried again yet, but I decided to write a review. This review.\nThank you.\nThis game gets you involved, and scares you at times. It also has a lot of humorous moments.\nI recommend Undertale.","March 17","true","37.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","9","11","3","1"

You will only understand what all the fuss is about when you see the best ending.\n\nIt's difficult to talk much about Undertale without spoiling things.  If this review seems vague, that is the reason.\n\nThere are many good things about Undertale.\n\nIt deals with some serious subject matter, and gives it the complex and detailed coverage it deserves, instead of resorting to simplistic, unworkable or even harmful, political tripe.  It does this without becoming depressing by mixing in lot of comedy, like the practice of performing comedies after tragedies in Shakespeare's day.\n\nIt does not have a plot in the conventional sense.  Every playthrough is likely to be at least a little different.  A vanishingly small number of other games (e.g. Dwarf Fortress[www.bay12games.com]) have achieved this with extremely deep simulation.  Undertale achieves this by making almost everything you do, even seemingly minor things, impact a large number of other things you will encounter later in the game.\n\nThe best ending is fully interactive, and if you do everything you can it will probably take you an hour or more.  I can't praise this highly enough!  Not only is it something I've never seen done before, but many other games have short, unrewarding endings, or even ones that punish the player for winning by having something bad happen to their or other loved characters.\n\nI love the “Act” and “Mercy” parts of the combat system.\n\nI really like the soundtrack.  It's quirky, but very listenable.  It's also long enough to leave playing for quite a while without becoming repetitive.\n\nEven some things I do not like (like some aspects of the combat system) could be argued to be ‘part of the message’.\n\nUndertale is not perfect, in my opinion.  However, it comes closer than most other games.\n\nI am personally not a fan of the action aspect of the combat system.  The boss fights in the last half of the game would require someone to react with the speed and precision of a computer without certain items that they are unlikely to have.  This is too difficult to be fun.  At least the game does include a workaround (the necessary items) for those of us who cannot react that quickly and accurately.\n\nUndertale misleads you into thinking you should avoid picking up or buying items because your inventory will be too limited with some bad advice in the beginning.  Further, it punishes you for using up certain consumables by making them unique or unavailable (because part of the world becomes inaccessible) later on.  One of almost every consumable is needed to complete a quest, or end a fight quickly, somewhere in the game.  The strangest thing is there seems to be no reason for this.\n\nThere also appears to be one bug in the game.  The solution to the piano puzzle sounds nothing like the hint.\n\nUndertale lacks the settings PC gamers have come to expect.  There are no graphics or sound settings.  You can run the game in fullscreen mode or in a tiny window that cannot be resized.  It would be really nice to be able to resize and maximize/restore that window.  It would also be really nice to be able to set the music and sound effect volume.  There is no way to remap the keys, which default to the arrow keys (movement and selection) and Z (confirm), X (cancel), and C (menu).  Given that the game demands speed and precision, it would be really nice to be able to change those key bindings to something more comfortable.\n\nI was gifted this game by a friend, and am very grateful.  This is one of the most enjoyable, and important, games I own.\n\nI hope this game will fill others with determination to confront serious subject matter in their games, and provide such impressive replayability.","November 11, 2015","true","22.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Now, I am totally glad I bought the game, but as all games, it has bad stuff. And as usual, I will start with the bad stuff of the game:\n\nThe biggest problem I've found so far, is one that has been slowing my playthrough since the start. And it's also something that I can't really understand at all: There's no way to change the controls.\n\nCan I please ask WHY? The game uses the keys Z, X and C for interactions, and the arrow keys for movement. I literally can't think of a SINGLE GAME on my Steam account that uses those buttons. And I have nearly 200 games. In nearly all games, you would move using the classic wasd, but changing this is not only kind of dumb for a PC only game, but makes playing the game be really unconfortable. I've searched through the Internet for ways to change the controls, and I've found nothing, only if you plug a controller. I forced myself through the game, suffering these controls because I LOVED the story, but if you then decide to play it on a Genocide Run to see all of the stories in the game, you WILL end up tired of them, garanteed. Now, people say that playing with a controller is better... BUT I SHOULDN'T REQUIRE ONE TO PLAY THE GAME! Just think: You usually move in games with your left hand. This game forces you to move with your RIGHT hand, or cross your arms, which I tried and ends up being a pain. And for what I know, left-handed people have it even worse... And the creators haven't done anything about it.\n\nThe second problem I see with it, and last issue, is the gameplay. And this is related to the Genocide Run as well. The difficulty spikes are so pointy, they could take an eye out of your skull. Normal enemies are really simple, some bosses have a really GOOD balance of challenge and fun (like Papyrus, he seems to be the best example, as he changes the rules of the battle mid-way through... But it doesn't feel forced at all), and some hard battles like the two last ones on the Pacifist run were hard, challenging, original and still fun, but then you have the two on the Genocide Run. Yeah, there's only two real bosses on the Genocide Run, which is kind of dissapointing on it's own, but you will also have to face a difficulty spike way more crazy than the one before, as it's real boss appears nearly after an hour of killing enemies that really can't fight you at all, and it starts throwing attacks REALLY F#CKING FAST. I was able to beat it because it's movements were easy to master after a few tries... But then the other boss of the Genocide run has a ton of attacks that are randomized, and attacks even faster. To that point I decided to just take a break, and take my time to beat it, as sadly, both issues the game has so far go really good by hand, making enemies that require you to move really fast be more difficult than they already are.\n\nThere's a third problem with the game... But that one ain't the devs fault. It's the community of the game. Back when the game released, people would not SHUT THE F#CK UP about the game. What's the problem with that? This game is heavily story-driven, to the point that if you eat too many spoilers, you might as well just ignore buying it and go watch a playthrough on YouTube. And what did the community did? Just that. Spam stuff about the game everywhere. I know they were trying to give the game a good name, so more people go and play it; however that can back-fire really easy. If you haven't yet been spoiled a ton of crap of the game, you must live under a rock, or have no friends that have played it.\n\nAll of that being said, what do we have left? A really, really good game.\n\nFirst of all, the story: It really gets you hooked for more. It's been really well written, and it shows that the creator actually knows what any gamer would do, as he though of nearly everything. And that's another thing...\n\nThe game really seems to be alive, to have a mind of it's own, to be self-aware of it. Everything seems to have a reaction, no matter how crazy it might be. It also helps that the forth-wall breaks a ton of times by some characters.\n\nTalking about characters, the game has a ton of them, and let me tell you, you'll find it hard to hate them. Even the enemies have personalities, something you nearly ever see.\n\nCombat is fun, if you stay away from Genocide runs. Feels rewarding to pull it off, and the boss fights are INSANELY EXCITING. It also has a item system which is okay, but suffers because of the controls at times. Save points are also forgiving, and there's usually at least one before those exiciting bosses.\n\nThe graphics are pretty. Now, if you hate old-school SNES graphics you might not like them... But I feel like everyone else will. The only thing that I feel awkward about is that the main character doesn't seem to have nearly the same detail as everything else.\n\nThe best part of the game, however, is the music. It's just perfect. Seriously. I'm not kidding. F#cking perfect. Well... Except in one part, when Toriel leaves you alone and you have to run for an entire area with a weird theme on the background. That's literally the only moment where I didn't like the soundtrack. And counting that it only takes 20 seconds of probably 8 hours for every run, it's not that bad.\n\nShould you buy this game? Yes. Totally. However, I don't see nearly any sales for it. If you do wish to buy it, put it on your Wishlist, and wait. I mean, the only time I remember seeing it on a sale was on the Winter Sale, and it was only a 20% sale. If you can get it for bellow 5-6€, then it's a must buy. Otherwise wait, as I feel like 10€ might be too much.\n\nAnd before I end, I must say: I am disgusted by the reviews of the game. I haven't seen nearly ANYONE comment the control issues on their reviews, instead some call it a 10/10, claiming that it's perfect. That's bullsh#t. If you can't make an honest review, please avoid doing it, as it creates problems like these. However, I would say that if the devs fix the controls, it's a solid 9/10, it's only bad part being the difficulty spikes. And maybe the over-used "Annoying Dog", that got old really fast.  rofl the Internet is gonna hate me just for that last part.","January 15","true","18.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","19"

Undertale has kicked even those classics I held so dear off their throne for first place as one of the most well-written, well-thought out and genuinely fun to play games, the trifecta of what makes a good RPG. The characters are interesting, the writing clever for something that deals with the delicate fourth wall, and the game itself a delight to play with quite a bit of variety for simple mechanics. (Relative to how they play, I'm sure they took quite a bit of doing in terms of programming)\n\nLots of comparisons to Earthbound/Mother and OFF have been made, I'm aware, those games indeed had some tear jerker moments and rather fascinating stories, details, and writing in them, and as much as I loved them, I'll be the first to say they also play like crap. While Mother 2 and 3 made me tear up a bit, OFF had me kinda scratching my head as I took it all in, Undertale got me emotionally invested to the point where I must concede a point to the villain and admit a pathetic aspect of me. Here, I cannot, as it'd spoil the fun, but I cannot think of a single title in the last decade that I'd recommend higher as of this review than Undertale.","September 26, 2015","true","27.9"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

It is supposedly reminiscent of the Mother and Earthbound series of games, but I have played no games from either series and have no nostaliga to be farmed off of them. It's also been more than a month since I last played the game, so any hype I've had should've subsided by now.\nI have played Undertale for 11 hours total.How has Undertale managed to compete with a game I've played with such devotion over a long period of time?\n\nHell if I know, go play it yourself. You should like it unless you have a huge amount of dislike for storytelling, challenging but not difficult bullethells and pixel art (you can refer to the screenshots on the store page for examples).\n\nI'm not gonna spoil anything about the game, so if you want a detailed review you'll have to look elsewhere. The game is a lot better when it's spoiler-free, however.\n\nI dunno what else to say, really. 10/10, I guess.

There's alternate dialogue everywhere, multiple endings, so many things to find... there's little secrets and hints, and it takes at least two playthroughs to put the important bits together.  Little hints and facts you may have picked up from just reading a bookshelf can come back and hit you hard when you learn more about what's going on, for example.\n\nThe battles are really interesting as well.  There's generally multiple ways to end a conflict, and the dodging mechanics when you're being attacked vary a lot throughout the game and major fights tend to introduce new twists.  The fights have a lot of work put into them, much more so than I imagined from seeing the simple Dragon Quest-style view.  Everything from the enemy reactions to the sprite changes and animations must have taken a lot of time for each monster, much more work than you usually see anymore.\n\nThe game's not very long, you can "beat it" once in a day if you push... but I think it's well worth getting 'cause there's so much in it to explore when you replay it (to try to avoid spoilers).  And yes, all the crying.

That's it. To say any more about the game would probably ruin it for you.\n\nIt seems to me undertale is becoming one of those games people don't shut up about. Like Minecraft, or god forbid, FNaF. And it's kind of a bittersweet thing. With a huge fanbase comes huge expectations for a game. Everybody and their mother is singing the praises of this game, and while I love this game to death, and it deserves recognition, the popularity is in a way doing the game a disservice. Not to sound like some kind of hipster, of course, but with all the voices of the internet calling the game the second coming of Jesus Christ, it's easy to come into the game with inflated expectations. And when you come into a game expecting the best thing ever, you'll undoubtedly be let down every time.\n\nMy advice is to just play the game, and listen to no one. And avoid the fanbase like the damn plague. It's a good rule of thumb to do so with most things, but here it's especially important. To come into this game expecting something that will change gaming and make you have a religious experience and give you a free pot of golden hookers is going to result in you being very disappointed.

The tale begins when a human child falls into the monster world below the surface of the human world. The (genderless) human child is controlled by the player. As one finds out, most monsters are not evil. However, there is one that is truly disturbing, but will you defeat him or join him?\n\nAs the player, you can decide to achieve either the "neutral" ending, "good" ending, or "bad" ending.\nFor the neutral ending, it's easy to get. In fact, it's required to get before you get the good or bad ending.\nFor the good ending,  you must never kill anyone. Show mercy, be nice. More importantly, be kind. Make friends.\nFor the bad ending, you must show no mercy and kill every single monster you encounter. You must kill those who would have been your friends on a different path.\n\nWarning: Go for the good ending before the bad ending. ... Also, if you do go for the bad ending, be prepared for some serious guilt-tripping. I, personally, couldn't go through with it due to a strong conscience, even though I know it's just a game.\n\nIf you have trouble getting through the game, especially with the final bosses of the neutral ending and bad ending, there's always the Cheat Engine.\n"This was more difficult than Dark Souls," <<< Direct quote from someone who's played Dark Souls and Undertale, referring to some bosses.

Undertale plays to the strengths of the RPG format, while also removing some of the more tedious aspects of it. Battles are fun, engaging, and anything but straightforward. You can go into a battle geniuley not knowing if your going to let an enemy live or die, and the choice you make can have massive effects on the progression of the game, in ways that you may not even realize. Enemies are no longer simply enemies, but a moral dillemma for you, as the player, to overcome.\n\nEvery choice matters. That being said, the game is short in an initial playthrough (about 7 hours). However, there are so many scenarios and secrets that depend soley on your choices that there are things that you will never be able to completely experence in a single run. This game is massivly replayable in that sense. I imagine that even if I played Undertale ten times over, I'd still be finding new things I'd never seen before. The choice aspect of the game makes it a very personal experience, and as a result, the game becomes very easy to get invested into.\n\nThe excellent music, characters, and dialouge are so strong that they will stay with you long after you finish playing the game. Undertale also has to be one of the funniest games I have ever played in my life. This is the kind of game that makes you question your idea of what a video game is, how it can affect you, and what it can acheive with creative genius behind it. If in the right hands, games can shock you in ways you never could imagine. This game will shock you with its brilliance. For all these reasons and more, Undertale is an absolute must play.","October 24, 2015","true","42.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

Undertale is a fantastic game, and alongside LISA it puts the vast majority of modern JRPGs to absolute shame.  Like LISA, the Earthbound influence is strong with Undertale, but it takes a far more heartwarming approach; though it easily can turn bleak as hell, but that’s all up to you. And that’s one of Undertale’s strengths, your choices and how you approach combat actually weigh heavily on what happens. The combat is also neat in how you have to avoid damage in sequences kind of akin to a SHMUP and the game constantly shakes these up and you get some really unique attacks to deal with. The writing is overall great, with charming characters and it when it pulls the heart strings it succeeds. It’s also genuinely funny. The atmosphere and soundtrack are also great. Finally I actually managed to get the best ending in my first playthrough and its one of the absolute finest endings I’ve seen to a game.\n\nOverall I’m totally glad I backed Undertale because it’s an RPG classic in the making and a must play. Ten bucks is an absolute steal for this game. Buy it.\n","September 17, 2015","true","9.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/starpeace/recommended/391540/","starpeace","Starpeace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/starpeace/","273 products in account","Undertale - The friendly RPG where nobody has to die\nI never heard of this game before until it release on Steam around September 2015 and it seemed to be very popular for some reason. I thought what's the big deal about this game? It look just like an RPG game like EarthBound or Mother 3. So I went to the Undertale website[undertale.com] and try demo. The first minute on demo was really impressive and after I finished the demo I went back to Steam and buy full game and soundtrack bundle instantly, I didn't buy games on steam for full price for long time but I really want to support the developer.\n\nThe very first game that make me feel bad for trying to kill monsters\nUndertale is a truly one of the most heartwarming and very charming story-driven games that I've ever played so far. I was playing normally by killing everything I encounter because that is just how an RPG games played right? but until I fought the first boss  Yes, it's Toriel everyone's beloved goat mom  and suddenly I just realized that I don't want to kill her but I accidentally kill her while trying to lower her hp but she will die if you attack when her hp is less than 1/4 of her full hp and that was the first emotional train that hit me straight into my face when I hear her last word. Well I have not feel so strong of an emotion toward game since the ending of Okami  Amaterasu and Issun farewell scene  anyway I reset that playthrough and start my new playthrough again and surprisingly, some of the characters know I regret my decision and decide to start new playthrough that mean every decisions you made in this game will be save in somewhere in game files and will affect the game unless you wipe your data on your computer.\n\nThe gameplay\nFirst, it might look like normal RPG game but when you play you will find some humor of this game like you cannot actually sell your items to shopkeepers like in RPG because they don't want to spent money for items that they're never use but there still only one shop that still want to buy your items because they want them and they have a very deep history "hOI! welcom to da TEM SHOP" or YES! You can literally date a skeleton! And maybe some events you may think the game crash but actually the game close itself to make it look like game crash. but the most outstandingly design gameplay that very unique is a battle system it still be turn base battle but instead of you and your enemies switch turn attacking each other the game will refer you as a heart that can move around and you control it to dodge enemies attack like a bullet hell game for avoid getting hit and when your turn to act you can choose to attack and kill them or chose "not" to attack instead if you feel bad for hurting them. This game have main 3 playthroughs, so as I mentioned earlier you can finish the game by killing everything or only kill someone who annoying you or even kill no one at all these playthrough you choose will lead you to different endings.\n\nStory\nThis is the selling point of the Undertale and the reason that I buy this game I really love Undertale's story such an amazing story that filled with good humor, morality and emotional feeling. Sometime they have some silly thing to laugh about or sometime will be moment that my eye cover in tears from very emotional story that make me try not to miss any content in Undertale not just dialogue but everything I suggest when you playing you should inspect everything in the game even it were pile of garbage maybe you might found an astronaut food. It really fun to discover secrets in Undertale. As I said some characters know about SAVE system that mean they will know what happened in last playthrough so dialogue will change when you talk to them that make Undertale different form other RPG in Skyrim you can save and killing people just for fun then load save again like nothing happen but in Undertale if you did that some characters will still remember so be caution if you playing on no killing playthrough.\n\nConclusion\nIf you are not into story rich game don't play it, if you are concern about "bullet hell dodging thing" because you are not good at it but still want to play the game for story then go and get the game it is not that hard and they have some armor Temy Armor to help you progress the game. This game is true morality story you will get what you really deserve at the ending of your playthrough that you choose. The soundtracks are very good too, they really affect the game so for the best experience you should not mute the game I have some moment that shed a few tears from my eye because soundtrack is so good and it fits very well with current story. 10/10 one of best games of all time for me.","November 20, 2015","true","38.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Toby put a lot of love and care into this game and it really shows, I have never been so invested in a story and it's characters in my entire life.  Undertale is definitely a game I'm going to continue coming back to every now and then just to revisit all the characters and places I love, which is all of them.\n\nEvery character and their dialogue are all so charming it's hard to dislike any of them, the art style while simple is appealing and fit the world perfectly.  Don't get me started on the sick jams the music is perfectly composed, every part of the soundtrack fits the moment flawlessly I could listen to the OST all day and have.\n\nAn "RPG" where playstyle actually changes the way the story shapes up, depending on whether you go down a pacifist, nuetral or genocidal path, characters, dialogue and places can change A LOT, allowing for several playthroughs.  Befriend even your enemies by choosing to just talk and outlast your enemies or MURDER EVERYTHING if you've got the stomache to handle it, it's up to you to shape how the story goes, Toby thought of every contingency when it comes to decision making.\n\nEDIT, I wanted to add on some things since I didn't talk about game mechanics:\n•One warning I would give is that this is NOT a traditional RPG, that term is kind of just sprinkled ontop of the game, the defensive combat mechanic during the entire game is an AVOIDANCE / BULLET HELL type of mechanic and is always in use, so if you're not fond of that type of gameplay or just not very good at it you're better off watching a playthrough.\n•Linear, if you have a problem with games being linear than yeah that's a thing I guess?\n•Some jokes/gags do run on a bit, some characters can be a bit two dimensional with their personality (on a surface level, there's more to them if you play a "true" playthrough), I felt it was written well and honestly I liked them through out the entire game.\n•This game isn't for emotionally detached edgelords either, it's a touchy feelsy type of story.\n\n\n\nTL;DR:  I legitimately have nothing negative to say about Undertale, I have never been so enchanted and enamored by ANYTHING in a very long time.  I think about this game every single day, I listen to the music every day, I've lost sleep over how much I love this game and I want to cry.  11/10  Would true reset my mind to experience it all again, over and over.\n\nGonna go lay down while I continue to experience an existential crisis.","September 22, 2015","true","77.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Undertale is a beautifully crafted work of art that made me feel a variety of emotions ranging from laughter to crying like a baby. One thing some people may not like though is the gameplay itself because while its labeled as an RPG half the time you are going to be playing a bullet hell minigame which may not be some peoples cup of tea, but if you can get past that youll find a game made out of diamonds with an amazing soundtrack filled with quirky and loveable characters.","October 5, 2015","true","40.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

Undertale is no exception. Its not just good, its smart. The story is entirely original, the gameplay is different with each enemy encounter, and the characters are lovable and exciting. There never was a dull moment in playing the game, even when traversing seemingly monotonous areas. Most of all, though. Its funny. The game never failed to leave me with a smile on my face. Even the endless amount of bad puns are done in such a way, it makes you smirk.\n\nAll in all, it's a must buy, even if you arent familiar with most RPGs. Undertale's combat system is so unique, you don't need prior experience in the genre to just jump in and play. So go ahead, start up the game and let the feel train take you on a wild ride through this wonderful little experience.","October 30, 2015","true","23.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kanery/recommended/391540/","Kanery","Kanery","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kanery/","410 products in account","Top to bottom, an absolute gem.\nWell done, Toby Fox.\n\nIt's incredibly hard to describe Undertale concisely without digging into its specifics, which ought to be experienced first-hand in the first place. It's hard to even categorize Undertale in a genre. The best description is often repeated though; "Earthbound with shmup." But even that statement doesn't necessarily do it justice either; the game is so wonderfully crafted with each section of the game feeling meaningful. There isn't a single moment of the game that feels unnecessary, and of course, further exploration is set to your leisure.\n\nThe game is filled with moments that will break the standard video game expectations that we are used to, so go into this game with an open mind from the start. Undertale is not the longest of games, but it will be a memorable one for me because it delivers in ways that recent games seldom ever do anymore. The reward isn't cheap, and filled with flashy rewards like inflated numbers in RPGs. The journey itself is the reward, and the motivation to move forward is purely to progress the game. In the ten+ hours I've gone through the game, I've never once thought about stopping due to any lack of interest. The pace of the game is brilliantly set and most importantly, the game itself never overstays its welcome at any point.\n\nIt's presented without fault. I'm not saying that to mean that this game broke the standard for video game graphics, but that it works for a reason. It's not a shameless retro throwback of "ohhh woooow a jrpg homage that looks like earthbound." Every aspect of the game feels crafted to work with its other components, and as a result, an 800x600 internal resolution of sprites doesn't take away from the game at all. It's essential and can't be replaced without making the game feel different.\n\nAlso the soundtrack blew my brains to Neptune. It's that great.\n\nI basically gushed for the last few paragraphs, so I'll get on to the point where I have to actually take away from it.\n\nIt's not the longest game, as I said before. Getting through ALL of the games content, of course, is going to take you a while, but this isn't a game that you can play for days straight and return to the following week. In fact, the replayability of this game will basically be the same as any other RPG: its value retains when you've returned to it in the future, forgetting the things about the game that make it so great. The initial experience is worth $10 easily on its own, however. Don't let game length determine how your money should be spent. At least not for this one.\nThis game is largely RPG and shmup, with tons of creativity involved. If you don't like RPGs, shmups, or neither in tandem, then I won't try to convince you that this will make you love them. At the same time, I'm fairly convinced that you could finish this game purely on the writing and story, even if you dislike both RPGs and shmups.\nIf you're looking for just a game-♥♥♥ game, just to sit down and brainlessly play through, then this isn't the title. Undertale deserves your fullest attention. It's pretty pretentious to call it an 'experience', but that's what it seems like at times.\nTrust me, even if you have no reason to. I went into Undertale with the expectations that this game would be as amazing as the demo that was pushed out a couple of years ago. It ended up doing exactly that, with the comforting and lasting gift of knowing that I'll come back to it again sometime later.\n\nGames like this aren't made often. They don't make you so invested into the material without tugging on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t plot strings or tugging on purely its writing. Playing the game is the reward in and of itself. For that reason alone, Undertale can be considered a fantastic game.","September 18, 2015","true","10.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The battle system gets really tedious after a long while and keeps cramming the "SPARING ITS RIGHT" option down your throat, most of the characters are actually mary sues i.e sans, papyrus to an extent. The humor in the game is really hit or miss unless you like really forced memes. The bullet hell idea is unique, yes. But the "sparing" thing is something that's been used before.\n\nNow for the fanbase, the fanbase consits of elitists and homestuck rejects thinking if they join the bandwagon, they'll get their 2 seconds of fame. Forced tumblr memes and AU's don't make a good fandom, and now for the elitists. They'll actively ♥♥♥♥ on you if you dare say anything about undertale they don't like. Even to the point of sending death threats and actively insulting you for what you like.\n\nThey insult MLP, Sonic, FNaF, you name it but they primarily target Freddy's, which in reality, isn't that bad. (...) They say they'll never be as bad as this or that, yet in reality they've already passed and showed themselves as something on-par with Nazi's. "NEIN YOUR ART MUST BE THIS AND IF YOU EVER MADE SOMETHING RELATED TO THIS, YOU'LL BE HANGED DUMKOPH."\n\nYou watch, within a few months now. It'll get to Sonic/Furraffinity-tier. Recolors and ocs everywhere, along with a plethora of half-♥♥♥♥♥ videos and content yet people will eat that ♥♥♥♥ up\n\nThe fanbase and the community needs to realize. They aren't perfect. They're byfar the worst.\nI can understand, that people are defending their favorite game and their community, but I can heartwarmingly agree with this. The game is overall good, but I do not advice to join or look for it's fanbase. It's really REALLY unhealthy, it is moreso the worst idea ever. Some parts of the community are actually quite nice; Nice chats about the game, the characters, etc. But handing me videos from something like the track "Disbelief", which is not even the original titel of the song, stating that the actual creator of that song copied it and remixed it...\n\n...No.\n\nAll I say is, play the game, have a good time, but after then there is nothing else left.\nGood game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community.","January 5","true","24.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","5"

If you haven't yet, I highly recommend that you give Undertale a try.\n\nMy Undertale experience? I'd seen some videos and it looked kinda fun, but playing it myself? I wasn't planning on it, but when a friend gave me a copy I decided to give it a fair shot. I started off uncertain, not sure if this was the game for me, but I soon came to love every bit of it. From the characters to the combat system to the random elements thrown in, I loved it all. Tibia honest, I was really sad to see it end after doing a neutral and pacifist run (I could never do genocide). I wish to play more yet at the same time I don't want to ruin my perfect happy ending. So, for me, my Undertale journey is over, but I will never forget it. It was a pun-tastic experience that I will always cherish.\n\nGoodbye Undertale. Farewell Sans, Papyrus and all my cool friends.

The music is outstanding (but people need to chill with the whole 'undertale has the best music of all time' thing, it doesn't). It's something you will invest your emotions into, and it knows that. This game will break you. It certainly broke me, I almost felt what humans call 'feelings.' Weird, right? I played this game like *spoilers spoilers spoilers* and 2 hours later I felt like a giant piece of ♥♥♥♥. Choices matter. A lot. Everything you do has an impact on the final outcome of the game, and it makes it all the more worth it.\n\nI'm going to give this game the highest rating out of any game I'd played that came out in 2015. I'd almost give this game the highest rating that I've ever given a game. It's fantastic enough to earn a 10/10, but I'm giving it a 9/10. Now that's not bad at all. I've only given one game a 10/10 rating EVER. 9/10 is ♥♥♥♥ing generous coming from someone like me who hates video games. It's my second favorite game to have come out in 2015, ironically sitting behind Killing Floor 2.\n\nSo why did I give it a 9/10 I don't hear you ask? Well, the internet has ♥♥♥♥ing RUINED this game. On the game front it has very few, if any flaws AT ALL. It's damned near perfect, However the fanbase and what the internet has made it out to be is just too ♥♥♥♥ing awful to ignore. The Undertale fanbase is so ♥♥♥♥ing awful, that I'd say it's significantly worse than FNAF and Minecraft. The best way I could describe the fanbase is Five Night's at Freddy's fanbase, only 1 year older, and much less mature. It makes sense, trust me. The fans are rabid as ♥♥♥♥, and it turned me off of the game almost entirely. I made a negative comment on an Undertale video that had nothing to do with the game, but a song in the game, and I got a DEATH THREAT because of it. (I'm not kidding, gyazo.com/feb1e8214b52b33115fa5a271eb41df7 <- screenshot). Memes aren't funny, especially stupid ♥♥♥♥ing video game memes. Also, something being random doesn't make it funny. It's ♥♥♥♥ing stupid when people say the humor is good for being "random." And when the internet finally realizes that, the fanbase will be slightly less cancerous than Furious Pete's crotch.\n\nThat's really all I can say about the game without spoiling it. And believe me, you don't want this game spoiled for you. I'm glad I bought and played through it before having the game spoiled for me, because this was a truly fantastic experience filled with lovable characters, an outstanding story, a great soundtrack, and one of best senses of humor in a game EVER. Undertale is absolutely 100% worth the money, and I'd recommend it not only to people who like RPG/Bullethell games, but to anybody who likes video games. This is by far one of the best indie games ever made.\n\nMy name is Storm, and you've just had the pleasure of reading this review.

It leans heavily on being both charming and whimsical, while simultaneously being a commentary on video games and players.  And to its credit, Undertale lives this double life quite well.  In my opinion, it’s able to do this so well by spending an incredible amount of effort was put into the characters and creatures throughout Undertale and in making them likable, and then making any commentary or fourth wall breaks be rooted in who these characters are.\n\nIt’s sort of a cousin to both Earthbound and the Stanley Parable that’s roommates with Abed from Community and Bat-Mite from The Brave and the Bold.

For one thing, no other game made me feel the way this one does. I bought the game one day and played through a little bit of it, and it honestly reminded me of the game The Stanley Parable, in which you can pretty much do what you like with no regards for rules that are around in nearly every other game. Undertale gives you a lot of freedom in the choices you make. If you went through this completely blind (as in, you've never heard of it before and know nothing about it, which is likely impossible by now), you'd probably learn a lot about yourself based on the actions you take. The thing I love the most about this game is that there are  real  consequences for the things you do. It's not like other games where they have "moral choices" which are blatantly obvious, and the results of your choice change maybe one or two things in the end.\n\nUndertale makes you really live with what you do. For example, when I first started playing, I absolutely hated Undyne. She was the most macho thing I've ever seen and, besides one other occasion I can remember, is actually the only character to use profanity in the entire game. No, I didn't kill her. That's what I love about Undertale, and it's sort of hard to explain. If you dislike someone in real life, obviously you wouldn't just beat the ever-living-crap out of them with no explanation at all. So, I suffered through her annoying attitude and just did the right thing. I spared her, and over the course of the game I learned to look for positive things in other people rather than just focus on the negatives. Yeah, I know it sounds cheesy, but it really did. By the end of the game, I loved Undyne and really was happy to see that she was included in the good ending.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, this game made me a marginally better person, and yes, it  did  fill me with determination. I'd rather show this game to my future children than some sugar coated story book. Thanks Toby, this is going down as one of my favorite experiences of all time.","December 10, 2015","true","12.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

A strange, vaguely lightbulb-shaped creature asks me what a star is. “Can you touch it? Can you eat it?”,  it inquires. “Can you kill it?” There’s a pause. “Are you a star?” The monsters of the Underground haven’t seen the stars in generations, after all, so it’s unlikely this thing would know anything about them. Littering the walls of the jewel scrawled caves of Waterfall are many plaques, inscribed with the depressing history of monsterkind. They detail the sudden attack from the humans, the one-sided massacre of a war that ensued; the mystifying nature of the SOUL. Not long after, you bump into a monster. 'Wosh u leg' the birdbath-like creature exclaims; before swiftly and dutifully beginning to wash a pizza.\n\nAnd that’s the general tone that Undertale sets from the get-go.\n\nREVIEW\nUndertale\n\nGENRE\nRPG?\n\nDeveloped almost entirely by award-winning Earthbound mod creator and webcomic composer Toby Fox; Undertale is a (mostly) joyous romp through the otherwise depressing yet quirky land of monsters. The opening cutscene details the legend of Mt Ebott, a forsaken mountain whose travellers are said to never return from. The year is 201X, and a small child, presumably looking for shelter from the rain, wanders into an opening at the peak. Whilst exploring the inside of the cavern, they stumble on some vines, sending them tumbling far, far down into Ebott. As luck would have it, they land on a well maintained bed of golden flowers. It just so happens that this child is you, you blundering ninny! [Why would you ever climb a mountain like that? Really!] Thus, your tale begins; your, uh, Undertale! [I tried, okay?]\n\nMoving on from my half-hearted attempts at humor, let’s talk about Undertale’s pull; its unique combat system and genuine, heartwarming humor. Sure, it has the usual RPG ensemble of combat mechanics; fight, items, flee, etc., but what truly sets Undertale apart from other games of its genre is the ACT menu. As you’ve probably seen from the trailer, the game’s description, or the blurb that sits alongside the game’s picture; the tagline of Undertale is: ‘The friendly RPG where nobody has to die!’ True to its word, Undertale is a game where not a single creature has to die; I repeat,  not a single creature has to die. [That is, unless you want to have a BAD TIME.] This is where the ACT menu plays a part. Each enemy presents their own puzzle for you to solve during combat, and as the game puts it itself: “If you ACT a certain way or FIGHT until you almost defeat them (Monsters)... they might not want to battle you anymore.”\n\nThis also ties into the game’s humor quite well, as, aside from the many fantastic puns and brick jokes, the ‘hostile’ encounters with the residents of the Underground are usually chock full of it. In the aforementioned Waterfall, there exists a monster named Aaron; a deliberately creepy literal seahorse who is muscular beyond reason. All of his dialogue ends in winky faces, even when he’s as scared out of his mind as he is ripped. On the topic of Aaron’s veterinary need for his sick pythons, the ACT menu allows you to foolishly challenge this apparent god of muscles to a flexing competition. While I say foolishly, it’s the pacifist’s way of beating this beefcake. Flex thrice and the equine epitome of energy will flex so hard that he flexes himself out of the room. Yes, I’m being serious, and that’s just one of the many interactions with the monsters of Undertale.\n\n“But what about the defensive side of the combat?”, you’d ask. “I was just about to start on that, you impatient little nerd.”, I’d respond. Much like you’d see in a game of Touhou [Or so I’ve been told, I’ve never played Touhou.], enemy’s attacks are presented as bullethell-esque challenge. You move your SOUL around a small boxed in region while your foe throws a variety of little, white ‘friendliness pellets’ which you must avoid; unless of course you like dying. Each monster provides its own unique pattern to dodge and adding more monsters to the equation only helps to further enhance the difficulty, as the monsters will combine their attacks into a completely new one. Heck, to take it another step further, the titular boss monster encounters can sometimes change the way you control your SOUL entirely. Sometimes you’ll be affected by gravity, forcing you to jump over dangerous obstacles; other times you’ll confined to a set of three pathways which you must swap in between to evade danger. Most importantly though, remember; blue stop signs.\nSo that’s the end of combat, and segues sure are hard; aren’t they? Speaking of segues, I just made a half-♥♥♥♥♥ one into the soundtrack section of this review. Neat, right? The soundtrack of Undertale is phenomenal, and I can without a doubt say that Toby’s reputation as a composer utterly precedes him. From the subtle uneasiness of ‘Your Best Friend’ to the bombastic whimsy of ‘Nyeh Heh Heh!’, the many fantastic songs of Undertale could only be described as unique. Personally, my favorite song from the OST is ‘Dummy!’ a hyperactive remix of the uniquely Undertale ‘Ghost Fight’. [Yes, I described it as uniquely Undertale; it fits the style of the game to a T.] Each song fits its situation perfectly, and, if you’re unfortunate enough, you might just uncover a certain someone’s calling card.\n\nAside from the audible presentation of Undertale; the visual presentation, while not too terribly complicated, is utterly intriguing. When you encounter a monster, the world becomes monochrome, aside from your SOUL; still a warming shade of red. Color is scarcely used in combat; reserved for truly singular spectacles or small, oft unnoticed details. A dark shade of crimson can barely be seen in a particular monster’s eyes, though you reaaally have to be looking to notice it. Outside of combat, the world is vibrant, colorful, expressive. The lovingly-crafted pixel art paints a picture of an expansive underground community, lively and fun; although sometimes dark and ominous if need be.\n\nAVAST YE, POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOWAnd that’s the truly astonishing thing about Undertale, it knows what it wants to be; it knows how to be itself. Over the course of my journey I was thrown through a whiplash of emotions and events, each delivered with the utmost sincerity and expertise. Many a hearty laugh came from the surprises Undertale had cooked up for those expecting something they'd played before. You're expected it to play like you would any other RPG you've played, and the game decides to play you instead; to take your preconceptions and mess with their very being. I find that if you let the game take your hand, let it guide you down this archaic, joyful, tragic, melancholic, path of madness; you'll come out better for it. Not many games can make you truly feel that child-like whimsy of playing your first game, of learning to love your hobby all over again; even fewer can make you truly attached to the characters of its world. I'll admit, I got a bit misty-eyed when my journey had reached its end, when I looked back at all the good times I had with these lines of code I’d come to know as friends. Undertale is a game that sets itself apart from the rest, a game that knows how to be how to be uniquely Undertale. One moment, I’m traversing a luminescent grotto; solemnly listening to the hopes and dreams of the species my kind has imprisoned for centuries.\n\nThe next, I'm getting lessons on hygiene from a washing machine and its bird.","November 26, 2015","true","39.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","2"

Rest assured, they're all here, but there is much more below the surface.\n\nWhat truly set Undertale apart for me was the overwhelming amount of love and care poured into it. Don't let the graphic style fool you; this game more than makes up for it with its memorable and relatable characters, incredibly catchy soundtrack, consistently unique battles, and an attention to detail that would make any fan of the Mother series proud.\n\nOn top of all this, the most engaging aspect of Undertale is the fact that there are always multiple solutions to any problem or opponent you face. The decision is yours to make as a player, and you only have yourself to praise/blame for the results of your actions. This game's unique take on the traditional/expected RPG was wonderfully refreshing.\n\nMy only piece of advice if you are considering this game for purchase is to avoid spoilers at all costs.

Besides this, there's engaging and unique ways to spare every enemy you come across which contributes towards several different endings as well as affecting the entire world around you as you progress. Truly the only game in the last year to understand the morality principle in video games and make it feel satisfying.\n\nUndertale features a magnificent story with compelling characters that continues to unravel over multiple playthroughs and changes depending on what you've already accomplsihed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/391540/","doomsdayforte","DF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/","936 products in account","I received Undertale as part of a Secret Santa gift swap, but it's been as cheap as $7.99 at the time of this writing.  It took me around 6.7 hours to get one ending and around 10.7 hours to get another.  I played pacifist from beginning to end since I figured, why not?  The game's description outright says you don't have to destroy anyone, so I thought I'd see how that would go.  And I enjoyed my experience.\n\nThe backstory involves a war between humans and monsters that the monsters lost, resulting in a magical barrier to keep them trapped underground that humans can freely cross.  You are a human child who climbs a forbidden mountain and winds up tumbling into the world below, thus starting the plot.  I won't say anything more.  I know with most games, you're encouraged to go in blindly so that your reactions to what all happens is most genuine, but I'd honestly encourage you to try and avoid spoilers before playing.  And that's rather difficult given the game's popularity, so good luck.\n\nI honestly did laugh a few times during the game.  It's seriously weird at times, silly, goofy too.  Some of the characters have...colorful personalities, and there are some great situations I find myself in too.  But that's how the game went when I was peaceful.  There are largely three routes with playing the game, between being completely peaceful, being completely violent, or some mix of the two, and the game will react to your actions, so that's something to consider when you start.\n\nUndertale is probably one of the more unique games I've ever played.  It fancies itself as an RPG, and while it does have random encounters and stats and equipment and healing items and so on, I'd honestly say it plays a bit more like a puzzle game.  That comes in more if you decide to be a pacifist, since you have to figure out how to get the monster to become Spareable through various context-sensitive actions.  It's somewhat reminiscient of Shin Megami Tensei's demon contacting feature, though you're always given the same options for each specific monster type, and the 'solution' to the fight is the same for each copy you encounter.  Unlike in SMT, you won't invariably anger monsters by trying the same dialog options that worked before or whatever.  Of course, you can just cut the knot instead and kill the monster if you want.\n\nThe combat system also incorporates a unique dodge mechanic.  Unlike regular RPGs where dodging is based on stats or equipment, you physically get out of the way of attacks.  That in itself isn't novel, but how many RPGs have elements of bullet hells?  You control a tiny red heart during the monsters' turn and you're given a field you can move within to dodge their attacks.  It sounds and is simplistic at first, but of course the game adds new elements to keep you on your toes.  Most of the boss fights introduce a gimmick and you have to quickly learn how to work with it and still avoid getting hit.\n\nThe encounter rate I thought was on the low side.  Fights in this game use invisible random encounters so you can't just avoid monsters or lure them away from where you need to go, but the fights are nowhere near as frequent as some of the RPGs from ages past.  This can be good or bad depending on how you're approaching the game, but I kinda liked not tripping over a mook every three feet.\n\nOn the difficulty side, I thought it was about middle-of-the-road.  I had to look up solutions to beat two of the bosses, mostly because I ignored what the game needed me to know.  Whoops.  For the puzzles, they were a little harder than what I'm used to in other games, but I didn't have to look up help for them.  The game does throw quite a few at you, but it never got to the point where I was annoyed at facing yet another one.\n\nOn the visual side, Undertale works a neo-retro style with pixel graphics reminscient of SNES games.  During battle, monsters show up in two-bit black and white, stark contrast to them appearing fully-colored in the field.  Characters have their portrait in dialog boxes and their expression will change to reflect their moods since the character sprites are generally not detailed enough to show these.  Some characters also use completely different fonts when talking, so that was an interesting feature.\n\nFor audio...well, a lot of people say it has a great soundtrack and I agree.  Music uses cues from chiptunes though it's not all beeps and bloops.  Some of the songs are another song either sped up or slowed down, sometimes with different instruments.  You usually wouldn't notice this.  Sound effects were there, though each speaking character had their own sound effect to go with their text appearing, giving them a type of 'voice' so that was a cool touch.\n\nIf you have an open mind and are willing to try something different, I think you'd like Undertale.  Someone going in expecting a typical RPG might be annoyed at the character personalities when they the player plays nicely, but that's why there's always the option to just be a typical RPG protagonist, right?  You'd like it a lot better if you're already familiar with RPGs already since you otherwise wouldn't know the concepts that the game addresses and uses and turns on their heads.  So not a great game to break into the genre with.  And despite its cutesy appearance, I wouldn't recommend it for young kids.  It might look sweet and innocent on the outside, especially given the gentle nudge for not hurting anyone, but...\n\nAlso, there's a demo on the official website.  It's not 1:1, but it'll give you an idea of what to expect, how the battles work, and so on.  If you're interested, it might be worth a try, though I never tried it out because...I didn't know it existed.  Whoops.\n\nAnyway, I really did enjoy my time with Undertale, though I don't think I'll be taking it for a spin again anytime soon.  I have a perfectly valid reason for that.","January 4","true","13.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Honestly, screw you.\n\nBack when I learned about this game, around April right this year (latecomer, I know), I talked about it to everyone I knew. I played its demo here on Steam just to poke the curiosity of my friends. I hyped them about how it kept track of your actions, forever. How groundbreaking this Dictatorial Big Brother feeling was, when not even reloading your save could break you free from it. How BIG and RICH it was, even being 1/6 of the whole game.\n\nYou, Toby, managed to make this game a literal definition of "a book that you take part of".\n\nAnd then you broke away from it with all the data tracking that keeps judging us for the rest of our lives (or at least, for the rest of our PC's functionality).\n\nAnd then you brought it back to this definition at the True Pacifist ending.\n\n...Which is all I can do. I can't play it any further, I can't turn these pages anymore.\n\nYou created an interactive book, a story about the silent suffering of those labelled monsters. You made us pace through all of their small stories, you made us clash with them, you made us decide their future. You made us see and you made us care for lives that doesn't exist and for times that never happened. Like a true author does.\n\nBut I can't say much more than "screw you", you magnificent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, because I can't play the rest of this game. You made me AFRAID of doing the Genocide Run. You made me afraid of executing nonexistent lives. You made me afraid of being judged for my curiosity. You made my own conscience chain me away from experiencing the other half of your tale.\n\n...Even though I did saw all of those, across the internet. And all of these reasons melded together made me glad that I wasn't the one doing these Runs.\n\nAs a gamer who couldn't rise to the challenge, and as a hobbyist writer who was too horrified to learn from this experience, I am ashamed to confess like this, that I don't have the heart to go through with the other half.\n\n...\n\nBut for someone like you whose creation managed to leave my soul shaken like this, it's a burden I'll gladly carry.\n\n(This edit was way too lyrical.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/391540/","doomsdayforte","DF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/","936 products in account","I received Undertale as part of a Secret Santa gift swap, but it's been as cheap as $7.99 at the time of this writing.  It took me around 6.7 hours to get one ending and around 10.7 hours to get another.  I played pacifist from beginning to end since I figured, why not?  The game's description outright says you don't have to destroy anyone, so I thought I'd see how that would go.  And I enjoyed my experience.\n\nThe backstory involves a war between humans and monsters that the monsters lost, resulting in a magical barrier to keep them trapped underground that humans can freely cross.  You are a human child who climbs a forbidden mountain and winds up tumbling into the world below, thus starting the plot.  I won't say anything more.  I know with most games, you're encouraged to go in blindly so that your reactions to what all happens is most genuine, but I'd honestly encourage you to try and avoid spoilers before playing.  And that's rather difficult given the game's popularity, so good luck.\n\nI honestly did laugh a few times during the game.  It's seriously weird at times, silly, goofy too.  Some of the characters have...colorful personalities, and there are some great situations I find myself in too.  But that's how the game went when I was peaceful.  There are largely three routes with playing the game, between being completely peaceful, being completely violent, or some mix of the two, and the game will react to your actions, so that's something to consider when you start.\n\nUndertale is probably one of the more unique games I've ever played.  It fancies itself as an RPG, and while it does have random encounters and stats and equipment and healing items and so on, I'd honestly say it plays a bit more like a puzzle game.  That comes in more if you decide to be a pacifist, since you have to figure out how to get the monster to become Spareable through various context-sensitive actions.  It's somewhat reminiscient of Shin Megami Tensei's demon contacting feature, though you're always given the same options for each specific monster type, and the 'solution' to the fight is the same for each copy you encounter.  Unlike in SMT, you won't invariably anger monsters by trying the same dialog options that worked before or whatever.  Of course, you can just cut the knot instead and kill the monster if you want.\n\nThe combat system also incorporates a unique dodge mechanic.  Unlike regular RPGs where dodging is based on stats or equipment, you physically get out of the way of attacks.  That in itself isn't novel, but how many RPGs have elements of bullet hells?  You control a tiny red heart during the monsters' turn and you're given a field you can move within to dodge their attacks.  It sounds and is simplistic at first, but of course the game adds new elements to keep you on your toes.  Most of the boss fights introduce a gimmick and you have to quickly learn how to work with it and still avoid getting hit.\n\nThe encounter rate I thought was on the low side.  Fights in this game use invisible random encounters so you can't just avoid monsters or lure them away from where you need to go, but the fights are nowhere near as frequent as some of the RPGs from ages past.  This can be good or bad depending on how you're approaching the game, but I kinda liked not tripping over a mook every three feet.\n\nOn the difficulty side, I thought it was about middle-of-the-road.  I had to look up solutions to beat two of the bosses, mostly because I ignored what the game needed me to know.  Whoops.  For the puzzles, they were a little harder than what I'm used to in other games, but I didn't have to look up help for them.  The game does throw quite a few at you, but it never got to the point where I was annoyed at facing yet another one.\n\nOn the visual side, Undertale works a neo-retro style with pixel graphics reminscient of SNES games.  During battle, monsters show up in two-bit black and white, stark contrast to them appearing fully-colored in the field.  Characters have their portrait in dialog boxes and their expression will change to reflect their moods since the character sprites are generally not detailed enough to show these.  Some characters also use completely different fonts when talking, so that was an interesting feature.\n\nFor audio...well, a lot of people say it has a great soundtrack and I agree.  Music uses cues from chiptunes though it's not all beeps and bloops.  Some of the songs are another song either sped up or slowed down, sometimes with different instruments.  You usually wouldn't notice this.  Sound effects were there, though each speaking character had their own sound effect to go with their text appearing, giving them a type of 'voice' so that was a cool touch.\n\nIf you have an open mind and are willing to try something different, I think you'd like Undertale.  Someone going in expecting a typical RPG might be annoyed at the character personalities when they the player plays nicely, but that's why there's always the option to just be a typical RPG protagonist, right?  You'd like it a lot better if you're already familiar with RPGs already since you otherwise wouldn't know the concepts that the game addresses and uses and turns on their heads.  So not a great game to break into the genre with.  And despite its cutesy appearance, I wouldn't recommend it for young kids.  It might look sweet and innocent on the outside, especially given the gentle nudge for not hurting anyone, but...\n\nAlso, there's a demo on the official website.  It's not 1:1, but it'll give you an idea of what to expect, how the battles work, and so on.  If you're interested, it might be worth a try, though I never tried it out because...I didn't know it existed.  Whoops.\n\nAnyway, I really did enjoy my time with Undertale, though I don't think I'll be taking it for a spin again anytime soon.  I have a perfectly valid reason for that.","January 4","true","13.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Undertale isn't the second coming of Jesus (as most reviews paint it) but it's a good game. Here is my review.\n\n✓ Great soundtrack (seriously, I literally bought it for the soundtrack)\n✓ Good story\n✓ Reference humor (some people say it's over the top; apparently they never played Borderlands 2)\n\n✗ Capped at 30fps (before you say anything: NES games ran at 60fps)\n✗ You can't take screenshots\n✗ Lacks basic elements like a main menu/options\n\nI don't wanna spoil anything about the story, but the game rewards you with feels if you take the 'goodie' route (no fights/aggressivity).

I love how guilty they make you feel when you kill too many monsters, and how they reward you with a happy ending if you go through the true pacific route. This game criticizes the way most games, novels and movies depict "good guys" who are more often than not the protagonists, and the "evil guys", who are evil simply because they are, and must be killed therefore, no questions asked. There's a serious flaw in this trend, because that is simply how things do not work in real life. As George RR Martin said, “No one wakes up and says: ‘What evil will I do today? Mu ha ha.’ Everybody thinks they’re the hero.”\n\nApart from that, there are several ways the plot of the game can develop, depending on your own actions, what makes you want to play the game over and over again. The bosses are also lovable characters if you spare them.\n\nAll of that make up for the lack of good design and general rudimentariness of the game, and make it more than worth it to buy.","December 23, 2015","true","50.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jexil/recommended/391540/","jexil","JexiL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jexil/","79 products in account","For ten euro, there's so much to pick up from this game. Undertale isn't your traditional pick up, play and put back in your shelf game. Partly because it's only avaliable digitaly, but mainly because It's a game that sticks to you. And impacts you.\nThe world of Undertale is alive. It's breathing. And by alive, I don't mean the game world is huge, or looks impressing graphically. Quite the opposite actually. The game world in itself isn't impressing in scale, and the game looks like a game straight from the SNES era. What truly makes the world of Undertale feel so alive is it's characters and world-building.\nEvery character is so lovable, charming and distinct to the point where you almost view them as real persons. And the writing in the game is so fantastic, it's hard to stop playing or thinking about Undertale once you're hooked. The characters actually remember your actions and reacts to them, just like a real person would do. The characters are some of the most lovable in a video-game, and it explains the endless stream of fan-fiction and fan-art for the characters of Undertale. Undertale is the kind of game where you loose yourself in the experience, loose track of time and absolutely love it. Or hate it. Depending on YOUR actions.\nAnd that brings me to my next point.\nUndertale is a game where you make choices. Real, heavy choices. And the choices you make actually matter. Not just within the next ten minutes of gameplay, but for the whole experience. As I said, the characters remember everything you do. The game has no less than three diffrent endings, each one playing out significantly diffrent compared to the others. To understand the full plot, and the full greatness of Undertale you have to get all of them. The replay-value is fantastic.\nThe consequence of such a living world, meaningfull choices and so lovable characters makes for a game incredibly easy to immerse yourself into. And Undertale abuses this to the max.\nDid I meantion that the writing in this game is incredible? It really is. I meant it.\nThe story has so many twists and turns and breaks the norm in so many ways, to the point that you never know what's gonna happen next. This game has some of the absolute most hearth-wrenching and hearth-warming moments in video-game history, and often you don't even see them coming. I wont spoil anything, but this game will make you laugh through your tears.\nAs you may have heard, I've mentioned the word experience many times throughout this review. And that's because that's just what Undertale is. This game will make you love yourself. Or absolutely hate yourself. The game toys with your feelings, and it's fantastic.\nBut what about the gameplay?\nWell, Undertale surely doesn't dissapoint.\nThe combat system is fast-paced and robust, with each fight being like a puzzle on it's own depending on how you choose to handle the situation. The way you fight also change drasticly depending on which enemy or boss you're fighting, which makes every fight memorable.\nAnd oh, did I meantion this game has a killer soundtrack? The game's tracks fit their scenes perfectly, and are a huge part of the game. The games track contributes to the experience immensly, and makes the emotional moments of Undertale hit even harder. Which is a rare thing these days. The boss tracks are also some of the most epic, awesome, hearth-pumping tracks I've ever heard.\n\nJust listen to some of these tracks. Seriously.\n\nHeartily recommended, buy it!","February 8","true","21.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","2"

The first two bosses are deceptively easy, but they get noticeably tougher later on, after you face a fishwoman spawned by Cthulhu himself. In the games climax, you face a Skeletal Monster who tapped into the very depths of The Warp for some insanely overpowered moves.

This game takes you through a unique, heart warming, and utterly heartbreaking story the likes of which I haven't seen done as well in any other video game. The JRPG nature of the game should not come as a concern to those who are not fans of the genre (I personally hate them) as Undertale meerly takes the frame work of the genre while adding its own twists to the mix (It breaks up the turn taking aspect with a sort of SHMUP like mini-game during the transitions).\n\nEven if the main combat-based gameplay can become a little frusterating at times, down to it's core this game is about it's atmosphere and story, both of which will suck you right in as you find yourself utterly engrossed in this game's (under)tale.\n\nI can't say enough good things about this game.

Sometimes you need to select the right actions; sometimes you need to run and reposition yourself outside of battle; sometimes you just need to wait X number of turns.\n- DO NOT SPOIL YOURSELF! There are few guides right now (the game is less than a week old), but reading discussions or wikis or guides will ruin a lot of the fun. Play through once or twice, then look online.\n\nOn to the review; minor spoilers ahead!\n\nTL;DR:\nPros:\n\n-Humor\n-Music\n-Characters\n-Some creative puzzles\n-Non-violence mechanics\n-"Bullet hell" dodge mechanic\n\nCons:\n\n-Morality system may lock you out of some endings even on future playthroughs\n-Choosing a pacifist run means you miss much of the RPG aspect\n-Graphic style is simplistic (I liked it, but this not a game played for graphics)\n\nFull review;\nI don't do reviews, typically. But this game drove me to make one.\n\nUndertale is wonderful. That's it in a snailshell. There have been a good crop of indie games recently; LISA was one of the most recent ones I played, and as it was thoroughly screwed up and hilarious in just the twisted way I like, I didn't think I would see it topped. Certainly not this year. Certainly not within a few months.\n\nBut Undertale topped it. In a year when I'm juggling games like LISA, Pillars of Eternity, and Dragon Age's final DLC, I still think Undertale will be my RPG, if not game, of the year.\n\nI knew very little coming into this game; just that it was an indy game with a non-violence mechanic, and the guy who does some of the music for the cultishly popular "Homestuck" web comic (Toby Fox) created it. I'm not a Homestuck fan, so that meant nothing to me. I played the demo a few months ago at a friend's recommendation, and didn't care for my ending. I decided to run as a complete pacifist in the actual game, which is what I've completed so far.\n\nThe game to me is like a mixture of Earthbound's humor, Portal's puzzles, a bullet-hell dodge game, and Dishonored's morality choices. That last part is one of the most interesting, but potentially frustrating, parts. Yes, you can play however you like - totally genocidal or totally pacifistic or somewhere in between. However, like Dishonored, giving into killing sprees won't make the ending very pleasant. Unlike Dishonored, it appears that the actions of previous games will have lasting effects on future games... even if you reset. Consider yourself warned.\n\nThe game's humor is a huge highlight, and it breaks the fourth wall constantly. Puns, font style jokes, dogs, genre shifts... I loved the humor. The game isn't all hilarity though, especially when you get to the end. Let's just say that if you liked LISA's style (dark and disturbed humor), I think you can get much of the same experience in Undertale where the mood can swing from immature jokes to tense darkness in the span of two comments. The music, for being remeniscent of old 8-bit games, is actually incredibly catchy; Fox's experience really shows here. Even on boss fights that killed me several times I still found myself looking forward to trying again because the music was just so good. The animation is simple, but effective; for being "8-bit" in style, a huge amount of expression and emotion is conveyed.\n\nThe only negativity I have has to do with the RPG aspects. Dishonored had the same problem - if you're doing a no-kill run, you won't be diving into the RPG aspects as much and thus avoid much of that part of the game. I'll be honest; this felt like more of a puzzle game with a dodge mechanic than an RPG when played this way. Your weapon will hardly matter (mostly only for added effects, like additional invincibility time after being hit, or +4 HP from food items), you won't look at your stats, and there's no grinding because your money will only be spent on low-level healing items since your max HP never increases. I feel that, like Dishonored, you're forced to avoid some of the core parts of the game for some of the lore parts, if that makes sense. In some ways it's worse because at least in Dishonored you could always start another run and go just for killing. In Undertale, doing so may very well screw over your future runs.\n\nIn conclusion... buy the game. Yes, the reviews right now are overwhelmingly positive because mostly only fans and followers know about it. But I anticipate that they'll remain highly positive even months from now. The game is just SO good. And while it's somewhat short (maybe 6-8 hours for a run through), I have no doubt that I'll replay it at least twice more.","September 19, 2015","true","10.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198015027101/recommended/391540/","76561198015027101","Wally","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198015027101/","235 products in account","Alright, I'll give this one a go. Before I dive too far into it, I feel I should be clear: I love this game. It's been weeks since I've finished it and I still catch myself listening to the soundtrack or looking up fan art. An 'undertale remix' search on Youtube is one of the first 'u' urls in my browser (which should be distressing but somehow isn't).\n\nBecause I love it though, I want to try to lay out clearly what it is and what it's not. I didn't follow Undertale until the pre-launch trailer went up and it got my attention; I didn't play it until a friend started it up and gave me all the details I needed to know I had to play it. So I want anyone who considers this game to come at it ignoring the hype surrounding it, if that's at all possible.\n\nPros:\n\n- The soundtrack is pretty rad. I think we can objectively agree on this, right? I guess if a kinda SNES/chiptuney aesthetic turns you off, it might not be for you - Toby, in my experience, obviously goes all in for that stylistically. It's more than that but I'm really not qualified to do music critique.\n\n- I'd be inclined to say the same goes for the visuals. I've seen potshots that it's more of this sort of "you made it in an old-school way because you can't do any better," and while that can hold true if you're burned out by this sort of thing, I think Toby comes by the style pretty honestly. It's artistically sort of like if someone took Earthbound's artistic sensibilities and used it to flesh out a dream-y kind of Yume Nikki aesthetic full of neat setpieces. If that and a general kind of old school look don't work for you, there's not much else I can say.\n\n- Gameplay is more involved and fun than the RPG Maker games I know I had in mind when I was thinking about buying this. There's a standard sort of turn-based menu selection element at play, but the shmup-y gameplay that occurs when you're trying not to get hit is done well. You'll notice it less depending on how you play the game but with boss battles, the game whips out some neat tricks to change how fights operate. I'd be lying if I said it's a profound, fantastic, super great system, but for what it is, it's done well and I believe should keep most people more invested than just clicking a button and smacking things (although you can certainly do that as well).\n\n- The game advertises itself as a game where you don't have to kill anybody, and it takes that idea as far as it can go. Sometimes it even takes it farther than you'd think it could. I don't want to comment extensively on it and risk ruining it, but Undertale plays the implications behind level grinding incredibly straight. The moments where you're figuring out whether and how to spare an enemy are the most praiseworthy parts of how the game is put together. There is at least one encounter I drove myself nuts over because of my absolute unwillingness to fight back and for a game to do that to me is one of the better things I can say.\n\n- This is a vague one, but: Undertale is not afraid to make narrative use of its medium. It's best you find out exactly how for yourself, but I would go so far as to say the particular ways in which Undertale tells its story are THE draw and what distinguishes it from the games it's influenced by.\n\n\nThese all constitute things I have a hard time imagining someone looking to get this game would dislike. What follows aren't exactly cons but they are things I would think about:\n\n- This absolutely feels like a one man kind of show. I don't recall who else was credited, but my understanding is that Toby did more or less anything that isn't Temmie. I personally love this - I've become kind of a crank about how soulless it is for me when I can't feel any distinctive personal touch in a game - but if you don't like Toby's writing voice, you're honestly probably going to have a bad time. I think the game is incredibly funny and I'm clearly not alone in that respect. But Toby is the kind of person that will take a gag and run with it, and isn't afraid of just throwing in random stuff that's meant to be amusing because of how out there it is. If bone puns, dating sim interludes, and having an obscene amount of hot dogs stacked on your head strikes you as stupid, well, don't hold your breath for that kind of humor to ever stop.\n\n- I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that Toby likes JRPGs. That sounds like a no duh thing, but hear me out. If you've played a JRPG or watched anime at any point and have felt that the reliance on hope and friendship you often get with them is cheesy and/or emotionally manipulative, I don't think Undertale will change your mind. There are clever touches that it sucks I can't mention here really, but when it unloads the power of love on you, you have to have an affection or openmindedness for that sort of thing to appreciate it. If you don't, it's probably just going to leave you cold.\n\n- From a conventional content standpoint, Undertale took me somewhere around eight or nine hours to beat and I may have taken more time than is normal. You could get more out of it depending on what kind of playthrough you do, or whether you play it again to go after a whatever other things you want to (there's a surprising amount of sort of cosmetic variability depending on how you handle sparing or killing monsters), but I had no desire to play any more after the ending I got and I mean that in a very positive sense, believe it or not.\n\n- And staying on content, most of that time is focused on walking around, occasional random battles, easy puzzles, and interacting with a ton of NPCs. I think it's a fair asking price for what I got out of it, but if you're hoping for a low price find with lots of sidequests, replay value, challenges that will hold you up for a long time, you're going to be out of luck. There are somewhere between one to three places I would expect most people to struggle, and you really have to overacheive to run into two of them. This game is largely a brisk narrative straight shot that goes from Point A to Point B that most people should clear quickly. I like not having my time wasted with filler so shortness isn't a flaw for me if what's there is good. I think it is but maybe that won't sell you if your idea of bang for your buck is getting a lot of time out of the games you purchase.\n\n\nCon:\n\n- Nitpicky, but I want to throw this in here. The game's transition from midpoint to finale is abrupt. I had the definite sense, which I was able to ignore in the spirit of what the game was trying to do, that I was being rushed through the end towards the final set of encounters. Before the endgame, I would say Undertale is paced incredibly well. As you hit the endgame, it starts to feel like some kind of cosmic deadline was closing in. What IS there is good, but I was sort of sad to feel like I was being rushed to the conclusion of something I could have spent more time in. Read a certain way, that's almost kind of a compliment though, isn't it?\n\n\nIt's all kind of pedantic and I regret how poor my cutting room floor instincts are, but I think this covers it. Undertale is a game I think as many people should experience as possible. I strongly recommend it. It's made me think a lot more about what you can do in a video game than I ever have before. It also happens to be more playful and fun than a stuffy sentence like that would suggest, hahaha. I could talk a lot more about what I personally really liked but I think it wouldn't be useful to someone looking to figure out if this is the game for them or not. Whenever it happens to get discounted, if you're someone who happens to be on the fence about it, just get it. At an even lower price than $10, I have a hard time seeing how you could get absolutely nothing out of it.\n\nOh, and, be good, won't you?","November 5, 2015","true","12.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","0"

(they obiously haven't played final fantsy VII) I played all the way through, and just didn't feel it. The combat is repetitive, the envionments aren't that great, and the music (which also gets loads of praise) is just repetitive chiptunes, and I'm not bashing chiptunes as a whole.

As a preface, I'll say that I have completed a neutral run of the game. I cannot stand how people tell me, "oh you didn't like it because you did the neutral run, you gotta do pacifist." Answer me this, if you are so gung ho on this game being about choice and how your actions affect the game, then why is only one way to play the game fun?\n\nEdit: Pasifist route really isn't fun I tried and almost shot myself because I was so bored.\n\nSO WHAT DO I THINK?\nIf so many people love this game the way they do, then I think it's worth it because you just might be one of those people. I just happened to not be. I give this game a 3/10, but I think it's worth a try. You just might think its a 10/10. This is just my opinion. "BUT SIR!" You are asking, "COUNDN'T YOU SAY THAT ABOUT ANY GAME?!" Yeah but look at the f***ing "overwhelmingly positive" review percentage. I'm obviously in the minority. So anyway thanks for reading and I hope you have a spendid day!

Only AAA games can be good!"\n\nThis game is rated extremely highly and nominated for a lot of top positions on game reviewing sites for a reason. if you are a person that's avoiding undertale because it's become popular/grown cancerous tumours on the community, you should probably rethink that a bit. The cringy parts of a community only really start to show after a game gets popular (and this is true for every game), but that doesn't mean by any stretch of the imagination that you should dislike the game itself. Don't be an edgy hipster and rant on GameFAQs about how terrible this game is without giving it a chance. With all that being said, let's get started with the actual review.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 8/10The way this game plays is different from every other traditional RPG. In Undertale, instead of your turn being over with just a click of a button, you have to go through a bullet hell minigame every turn. Instead of being reliant on cheese strats, you'll have to actually know attack patterns in order to play this game. This is also influenced by the fact that it requires some thinking with certain monsters, where you'll have to puzzle out what your next action will be. Don't stress about the difficulty on this game, because it can cater to people looking for a challenge and people just looking for a casual playthrough. Give it some time and you'll see why I rated the gameplay this high.\n\nGRAPHICS: 5/10Personally, I'm fine with the graphics, but to be fair 8-bit graphics aren't really satisfying to a lot of people- but you'll likely get used to it after an hour or two of playtime. But aside from that, there's plenty of charming visuals in the game that add to the atmospheres of certain areas.\n\nSOUND: 10/10One of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a game, I'd throw down $10 any day to be able to listen to the soundtrack; in fact, the soundtrack itself probably creates 75% of the atmosphere in most of the areas and I certainly recommend people to buy the soundtrack as well.\n\nSTORY: 11/10This game is obviously known for its story, and that's because it's amazing. There'll be a lot of lovable characters, foreshadowing, and plot twists...but it's up to you to find them, because I'm not spoiling anything. Even beyond all that, there has been MASSIVE speculation by the community on parts of the game that are ambiguous which can really make you think about the story. Not to mention, on your subsequent playthrough, you will definitely see things differently.\n\nOverall, this is an experience that you don't wanna miss in a game, and it'll be a game that I'll always remember; and who knows, maybe you'll end up with the same thoughts on the game as me. The real downside that people note is the amount of playtime, which lasts from 10-20 hours on average. But take my word for it, your $10 will be worth all of these hours. If you ever get to a point of the game where you feel like it wasn't all that good, I ask you to experience or watch the two main endings (avoiding spoilers, look them up or ask about them when you're ready) in the game and think about it for a while before you start turning into a keyboard warrior. So what are the final thoughts on this game?\n\nI don't know you should really just have this game installed already","November 29, 2015","true","10.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

Undertale just entered in this list in the past night, as I am writting this review.\n\nIn this game, you play in the skin of a human girl that has fell into the depths of a mountain, where there is a world with monsters sealed away from the surface for many years due to a war where humans ended victorious. In order to the monsters be able to return back to the surface, they need a last human soul out of 7... and that's you. What are you going to do? Will you fight back and destroy them?... Or will you spare them with hopes they won't harm you and understand that humans aren't necessairly murderers? Well, you will be pleased to know that you can actually decide which destiny you want in this game: you can optate to kill every monster you find, you can kill ones and give mercy to others and you can give mercy to everyone. And every little action you do in the game has got consequences in the story. This is the only RPG I know where you can win without killing opponents and that was one of the main reasons I got interested in trying out this game. I went for a Pacifist Route as I really did not want to finish the life of the creatures and let survivors thinking that every human is equal and I can guarantee that your actions are rewarded in surprising ways! You also end up getting attached to the most important characters of the game as each has got a different personality and are really memorable!\n\nNow, I will talk about the game by parts and tell what I think about each:\n\nStory - The essence of Undertale's story is simple as I explained above but it is impressive the level of depth it has got as I can really tell that these indie developers have put a lot of thought in it not just by having experienced the game but also by informing myself on the internet about the other kind of consequences it can bring depending of other types of actions you do. There are really many different versions of the story. There's drama but there is also a lot of humour, dark humour and references to japanese culture and I promise that this game will steal you smiles and laughters!\n\nGraphics - Other thing that pleases me in Undertale is the retro aesthetic it has got but this is just a matter of personal taste. They are pleasant and detailed. It interestingly changes to a more minimalist graphism once you enter in a battle. There's a detail that I won't develop a lot as it involves spoilers but there is a point where I really believe you will feel disturbed by the type of visual a certain monster adquires for being distinctively "out of place".\n\nGameplay - In third person it works like a normal RPG: you wander around to explore the environments and you interact with characters to obtain informations. Ocasionally, you will be dragged to battle with a random monster. Fortunately, the encounters are not annoying as they do not appear a lot of times. In battle, you have four options: to fight (a graph appears and a vertical bar passes through it. The more centered the bar is by the moment you press your key, more damage you inflict), to act (this functionality is really interesting as the secondary options that appear really depend of the monster you find, and even in here the creators used a lot of humour!), to use items (like in normal RPGs, items can be used to heal HP or to increase stats) and to give mercy (monsters will be spared from harm but it won't work unless you performed necessary actions in the Act command although this rule only applies to the majority of the monsters). The way battles work has got an original mechanism as I never saw something similar before: your soul is represented with a red heart and inside a limited area you can move it to dodge yourself from enemy attacks that vary a lot. There are occasions where you have your soul limited to specific movements too or that you are exposed to special enemy attacks that force you to either freeze yourself or to move yourself to ensure you don't get harmed. You really need to have dexterity in your fingers as some enemies attacks (especially bosses) can be really difficult to dodge. A note I would like to make is that in case you want to spare every monster, is the fact that every monster you find has got a different way to be "defeated" and they are not only creative but will also surprise you and make you laugh a lot!\n\nControls - I don't have got a single complaint in these: they are simple and very sharp. If you are enoughly familiar with playing with a keyboard you won't have any issues.\n\nSound and music - Just like the graphics, these are retro-like. The sounds are varied and simple. While there is not a lot of different musical tracks in the game I found them pleasant.\n\nDifficulty level - The level of difficulty is progressive and is challenging but not to the point of frustration.\n\nLongevity and replay value - I finished the game in approximately 10 hours but the time of conclusion might vary depending of the player skills and the destiny you choose. It is relatively short, but the fact that your actions change the whole story course gives you extra reasons to consider returning to the game and play it again.\n\nI am really happy that a game like this appeared in an industry overflooded with games with the same selling formulas and same conception formulas. It brought a completely new way to play an RPG and hooks you to the end. I do think the industry needs more games like this as with the technology evolution many game makers seem to forget what's most important in the conception of a videogame: its essence, its soul.\n\nUndertale is a hidden indie gem that deserves recognization. I really can't find any complaint for it as I never found any annoyances in it nor even glitches. And this game can be yours for only 9,99€, a real bargain. Please buy it, it is worth every cent. And spread the word: Determination.","December 5, 2015","true","10.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

Undertale just entered in this list in the past night, as I am writting this review.\n\nIn this game, you play in the skin of a human girl that has fell into the depths of a mountain, where there is a world with monsters sealed away from the surface for many years due to a war where humans ended victorious. In order to the monsters be able to return back to the surface, they need a last human soul out of 7... and that's you. What are you going to do? Will you fight back and destroy them?... Or will you spare them with hopes they won't harm you and understand that humans aren't necessairly murderers? Well, you will be pleased to know that you can actually decide which destiny you want in this game: you can optate to kill every monster you find, you can kill ones and give mercy to others and you can give mercy to everyone. And every little action you do in the game has got consequences in the story. This is the only RPG I know where you can win without killing opponents and that was one of the main reasons I got interested in trying out this game. I went for a Pacifist Route as I really did not want to finish the life of the creatures and let survivors thinking that every human is equal and I can guarantee that your actions are rewarded in surprising ways! You also end up getting attached to the most important characters of the game as each has got a different personality and are really memorable!\n\nNow, I will talk about the game by parts and tell what I think about each:\n\nStory - The essence of Undertale's story is simple as I explained above but it is impressive the level of depth it has got as I can really tell that these indie developers have put a lot of thought in it not just by having experienced the game but also by informing myself on the internet about the other kind of consequences it can bring depending of other types of actions you do. There are really many different versions of the story. There's drama but there is also a lot of humour, dark humour and references to japanese culture and I promise that this game will steal you smiles and laughters!\n\nGraphics - Other thing that pleases me in Undertale is the retro aesthetic it has got but this is just a matter of personal taste. They are pleasant and detailed. It interestingly changes to a more minimalist graphism once you enter in a battle. There's a detail that I won't develop a lot as it involves spoilers but there is a point where I really believe you will feel disturbed by the type of visual a certain monster adquires for being distinctively "out of place".\n\nGameplay - In third person it works like a normal RPG: you wander around to explore the environments and you interact with characters to obtain informations. Ocasionally, you will be dragged to battle with a random monster. Fortunately, the encounters are not annoying as they do not appear a lot of times. In battle, you have four options: to fight (a graph appears and a vertical bar passes through it. The more centered the bar is by the moment you press your key, more damage you inflict), to act (this functionality is really interesting as the secondary options that appear really depend of the monster you find, and even in here the creators used a lot of humour!), to use items (like in normal RPGs, items can be used to heal HP or to increase stats) and to give mercy (monsters will be spared from harm but it won't work unless you performed necessary actions in the Act command although this rule only applies to the majority of the monsters). The way battles work has got an original mechanism as I never saw something similar before: your soul is represented with a red heart and inside a limited area you can move it to dodge yourself from enemy attacks that vary a lot. There are occasions where you have your soul limited to specific movements too or that you are exposed to special enemy attacks that force you to either freeze yourself or to move yourself to ensure you don't get harmed. You really need to have dexterity in your fingers as some enemies attacks (especially bosses) can be really difficult to dodge. A note I would like to make is that in case you want to spare every monster, is the fact that every monster you find has got a different way to be "defeated" and they are not only creative but will also surprise you and make you laugh a lot!\n\nControls - I don't have got a single complaint in these: they are simple and very sharp. If you are enoughly familiar with playing with a keyboard you won't have any issues.\n\nSound and music - Just like the graphics, these are retro-like. The sounds are varied and simple. While there is not a lot of different musical tracks in the game I found them pleasant.\n\nDifficulty level - The level of difficulty is progressive and is challenging but not to the point of frustration.\n\nLongevity and replay value - I finished the game in approximately 10 hours but the time of conclusion might vary depending of the player skills and the destiny you choose. It is relatively short, but the fact that your actions change the whole story course gives you extra reasons to consider returning to the game and play it again.\n\nI am really happy that a game like this appeared in an industry overflooded with games with the same selling formulas and same conception formulas. It brought a completely new way to play an RPG and hooks you to the end. I do think the industry needs more games like this as with the technology evolution many game makers seem to forget what's most important in the conception of a videogame: its essence, its soul.\n\nUndertale is a hidden indie gem that deserves recognization. I really can't find any complaint for it as I never found any annoyances in it nor even glitches. And this game can be yours for only 9,99€, a real bargain. Please buy it, it is worth every cent. And spread the word: Determination.","December 5, 2015","true","10.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDakota/recommended/391540/","TheDakota","Dakota | 4 Days","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDakota/","101 products in account","OverviewSetting\nUndertale is a low-res RPG set in an undefinable setting. It borrows a lot of elements from several different archegenres, that I won't list here. The game takes place underground and across several different locations in this cavern.\n\nCombat\nThis game uses turn based-combat with the command blocks similar to other RPGs that also employ this system, such as Attact and Item menues. While in combat, you utilize an "attack bar", where you must time your hits to the center of the bar for maximum damage during your turn. During the enemy's turn, you have the oppertunity to avoid their attacks, via verticle-shooter style, where you must actually avoid attacks to prevent damage.\n\nGraphics\nUndertale uses Pixel-based graphics, much like the old Marios and a few newer games, such as Bit-trip runner and Cavestory.\n\nSound\nThe sounds for this game were very good, if you're into 16 bit sounds. The sound effects match actions well, such as movement through menus and attacking, and so forth. The music of this game is memorable, and some of it is quite catchy, to the point to where you never want to finish a combat sequence or leave an area. Of course, there were also a few tracks that didn't tickle my fancy, and ended up bothering me after a bit, but those were few and far between.\n\nStory\nUndertale is about a boy who fell down a hole into a cavern. Inside this cavern dwell monsters of many different shapes and forms, but not all are inheriently hostile. Your journey through this cavern takes you through a few noteworthy areas, and introduces you to a colorful cast of very well designed characters. While the characters themselves don't have a terrible amount of backstory, their personalities are very well conveyed and make this experience a very entertaining one.\n\nOther notes/mechanics\nUndertale is a unique game for a few reasons. First of all, you don't have to kill a single creature. Not a single enemy. Second of all, it focuses heavily on comedy and puzzles as core elements of it. This is very well done in my opinon, as the jokes aren't forced (except for the blatanly obvious ones that are made by the characters), and the puzzles aren't particularly hard, but do require some thought and exploration to solve.\n\nAND YOU CAN USE A CONTROLLER.\n\nMy thoughtsSo... This game is wonderful. It's beautifully thought out and executed in an extremely great manner that could lead to several hours of playtime. There's a huge world of lore and tidbits that could have you reading for hours at a time. The bosses of the game are unique in their attacks and personalities too, and in the fact that you don't actually have to kill any of them, due to the mercy option on your command board. I loved just how much fun the characters were, and how well (or comically bad) they interacted with each other. The visuals, for me, allow for imagination about the world around you, due to just how few there are. None of the boss fights felt unfair or as though they were impossible to overcome. The story made me smile, laugh, shudder, cry, and even filled me with determination.\n\nFinal\nI absolutely encourage anyone who enjoys games that take them on adventures to places forigen, both in reality, and in your own mind. It's truly an experience worthy to be had.\n\n11/10\n\nAnime's real, right?","January 4","true","23.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoshizen/recommended/391540/","yoshizen","healthy dog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoshizen/","76 products in account",""B-but this game is an overrated indie game! Only AAA games can be good!"\n\nThis game is rated extremely highly and nominated for a lot of top positions on game reviewing sites for a reason. if you are a person that's avoiding undertale because it's become popular/grown cancerous tumours on the community, you should probably rethink that a bit. The cringy parts of a community only really start to show after a game gets popular (and this is true for every game), but that doesn't mean by any stretch of the imagination that you should dislike the game itself. Don't be an edgy hipster and rant on GameFAQs about how terrible this game is without giving it a chance. With all that being said, let's get started with the actual review.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 8/10The way this game plays is different from every other traditional RPG. In Undertale, instead of your turn being over with just a click of a button, you have to go through a bullet hell minigame every turn. Instead of being reliant on cheese strats, you'll have to actually know attack patterns in order to play this game. This is also influenced by the fact that it requires some thinking with certain monsters, where you'll have to puzzle out what your next action will be. Don't stress about the difficulty on this game, because it can cater to people looking for a challenge and people just looking for a casual playthrough. Give it some time and you'll see why I rated the gameplay this high.\n\nGRAPHICS: 5/10Personally, I'm fine with the graphics, but to be fair 8-bit graphics aren't really satisfying to a lot of people- but you'll likely get used to it after an hour or two of playtime. But aside from that, there's plenty of charming visuals in the game that add to the atmospheres of certain areas.\n\nSOUND: 10/10One of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a game, I'd throw down $10 any day to be able to listen to the soundtrack; in fact, the soundtrack itself probably creates 75% of the atmosphere in most of the areas and I certainly recommend people to buy the soundtrack as well.\n\nSTORY: 11/10This game is obviously known for its story, and that's because it's amazing. There'll be a lot of lovable characters, foreshadowing, and plot twists...but it's up to you to find them, because I'm not spoiling anything. Even beyond all that, there has been MASSIVE speculation by the community on parts of the game that are ambiguous which can really make you think about the story. Not to mention, on your subsequent playthrough, you will definitely see things differently.\n\nOverall, this is an experience that you don't wanna miss in a game, and it'll be a game that I'll always remember; and who knows, maybe you'll end up with the same thoughts on the game as me. The real downside that people note is the amount of playtime, which lasts from 10-20 hours on average. But take my word for it, your $10 will be worth all of these hours. If you ever get to a point of the game where you feel like it wasn't all that good, I ask you to experience or watch the two main endings (avoiding spoilers, look them up or ask about them when you're ready) in the game and think about it for a while before you start turning into a keyboard warrior. So what are the final thoughts on this game?\n\nI don't know you should really just have this game installed already","November 29, 2015","true","10.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shakabra/recommended/391540/","shakabra","shakabra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shakabra/","171 products in account","There is so much to fathom or take into account involving Undertale; is it taking a little too much from its predecessors, or has it hit the perfect spot of being its own unique experience?\n\nWell i definitely think the latter is what won me over, being a person who has played and experienced the other games that Undertale has cloned slightly (Earthbound, Mother etc.). The game distinguishes itself overall by its own unique quirky humour and moments, something that is kind of missing in today's gaming industry. Something that gives the game its own distinguishable style. Games like Portal are examples of this as they use an engine of visual style of other games (Half-Life, Source) yet somehow easily distinguish themselves from the others due to their incredible small stories and little slice of atmosphere put into it through the labour of love from the developers.\n\nI am kind of rambling on, but my point still stands; Undertale is a game which from a couple of glances could fool anyone into thinking its just some kind of clone Japanese-esque RPG, but what it brings to the table that really makes a far better game than the others is the sheer atmosphere and level of emotion the game invokes on the player. The characters designed and the unique idea of the "game state" style of interaction, where the game acts completely self aware really make the game for me. The style of the fighting involved is something that really hasn't been done before quite as well as this game. The polish and unreal attention to detail in everything in the game makes it pretty damn hard to find any plothole that sticks in your mind (looking at you Bioshock Infinite).\n\nThis game genuinely gave me hope for something great to come out of the Indie market. While a lot of developers these days are quick to throw "early access" and half finished products with little to no effort or labour involved in them, this game really shows that the indie market can outweight triple budget games by putting in some real passion to the works.\n\nOverall I would give this game a 9/10 easily just from how well Toby Fox has made it, simply put. Well done, man, and I hope this isnt just the final game you make. This world needs more people like you, who make gaming be more than just playing a video game to pass the time.","December 13, 2015","true","82.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","2"

If you aren't sure, just play the demo.\n\nThe ending(s) are amazing and the storyline / narrative is amazing even if you don't like the RPG genre or narrative driven games. It is so well written that one of the hardest part of doing a genocide run (a run where you kill everything) is that it feels horrible since so many of the characters are so well presented and have such unique personalities, even in the random ecounter battles against common enemies it feels horrible killing them (most of the time, no one likes Jerry).\n\nThe soundtrack the second best I have ever heard, only thing that beats it is the Hotline Miami 2 soundtrack. Then again, I don't think it's possible to make a soundtrack that would better suit a game like this.\n\nAlso it is terrifying, at one point i was as far away from my monitor as my headset cable would go, with my headset around my neck. Maybe I'm just bad at scary things.\n\nTL:DR play demo or just buy it please.","December 29, 2015","true","34.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Hmm, probably nothing. Please note that spoilers will happen after this so do not read unless you want to lose your enjoyment.\n\nI went in this game knowing little to nothing except there was a puppy in armor at some point in the game. I wasn't aware of how the game started, of how it worked or even of what it was about, I've seen countless people talk about undertale but I've never bought into the hype, thinking the game was, after all, hype. I finally purchased the game after a certain lady got me into the game, I'm not gonna mention who but that person was with me for the whole adventure and was a silent observer, which was GREAT for my first playthrough. Seriously, it's much more enjoyable for the spectator AND the player if you shut your ♥♥♥♥ing mouth until the game was finished once... Anyways.\n\nPlus:\n=Characters you can easily get attached to\n=Deep story based game\n=Funny moments\n=Very interesting overall\n\nCons:\n=Very hard to go in "blind", most likely get spoiled\n=Pretty bad fanbase\n=Can break your tiny little heart\n=Probably will make you look up skeleton porn or atleast one of the characters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*************SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT TILL THE END THIS IS A RESUME OF MY JOURNEY*******************************\n\nNow, I was thoroughly ♥♥♥♥ed in the ♥♥♥ by the game showing me how emotionnally attached I could get to just anything in a game in a few minutes, I've went and gone through the tutorial, finding the game stupidly easy and making fun at a few points every now and then... After that well, I killed Toriel. Yep, I'm a gamer who's used to killing before acting. Woups. At this point, I restart the game and this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ talks to me like he knows when I've been born and how much times I got beat up in high school, basically telling me "Oh, you killed Toriel? Well guess what, she ♥♥♥♥ing knows." and then proceed, choosing to be VERY careful from this point on to kill as less as possible.\n\nSkip forward to Mettaton's ultimate form. I go ahead and fight him, literally trying to do 'MERCY' until he gives up and stops fighting me and using dog salads whenever I need it.\n\n3 hours later and a raging hatred for mettaton, I beat him.. Yes, I've beaten mettaton without using anything that boosts my ratings, literally just ♥♥♥♥ing tried using mercy on him the whole time when I wasn't healing but I've made it.\n\nFast forward to the last boss, I got killed often and I wasn't on a pacific run since I killed some frogs in the beginning to level myself up. I kill mr friendly pig with regret and brace myself for the rest..\n\nWell ♥♥♥♥ me, I hated flowey more than I ever hated an animated character in a game.. About 5am when I see the ultimate flowey form and I'm dizzy from exhaustion AND from .. I don't know.. Shock? I felt something weird when I saw his ♥♥♥♥ed up form but I can't quite tell what it was. Anyways, he kills me a dozen times while ♥♥♥♥ing around with my game executable and after a long journey, he dies. Bittersweet ending then rolls by.\n\nI now am deciding to do a pacifist run 2-3 days after. I get through it, go through the most horrifying secret underground lab I've ever seen and end up fighting ♥♥♥♥ING FLOWEY a second time, this time with the regular "Oh I'm not a villain, I'm just lonely" cliché ending. While it's cliché, I still felt sorry for flowey and I walked all the way back to the beginning of the game to try and get him to join me and his parents on the journey to the surface. Sadly, nothing I could do about this. I've freed dozens monsters but there is one soul I couldn't save and this made the game feel like it was incomplete.\n\nFinally, I am going to do a butcher run eventually but I am not emotionnaly ready to kill my precious monsters.","March 4","true","49.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","2"

While at first glance one might think, "This just looks like some old-school RPG nostalgia thing", there's so much more to this game. The ridiculous amount of hype and adoration for this game might be off-putting for some, but I absolutely love this game enough to say that it earns a very high spot in my favorite games of all time.\n\nI'll keep this review short, as there are plenty of them already. I recommend Undertale for it's humor, character development, and refreshing take as a RPG game. I'm not one to get emotional about most things, especially a video game, but darn it if I didn't come close to crying several times as I progressed through the story.\n\nThe value you'll get from Undertale is far more than just the $9.99 you'll spend on it.

There's like 8 weapons and 9 armor sets you can find, with minimal differences sort of "this ones slightly stronger" and some have a mild effect as well.\n\nIt's a very short game and not so much a game as it is a story. The menu is clunky, there's no config options.

You like warm, fuzzy feelings? Puppies and cute things? You don't like to feel sad, do you?\n\n\nYou need to play this game then.\n\n\nPlay this game, and it'll make you happy. And the happier you are, the more love you'll feel.\n\n\nYou can trust your ol' pal Waffle King on this one.\n\n\nUndertale is a game like very few others. It's an RPG with a unique twist. The entire game can be played without killing a single monster. All of them can be dealt with in a peaceful and civil manner. Or alternately you can kill all of them, but why would you want to do that? ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nAnd I really must say, every possible expectation I had was gratuitously exceeded.\n\n\nI did not know a game like this could happen. I did not think it possible.\n\n\nThis is Mother 4. The real Mother 4. Unless Nintendo makes another one, I guess. But even then, there's no telling if it'd be a product of genuine heartfelt emotion like this is. "Mother 4: Zip Lash" would not have the same impact Undertale has, you know?\n\n\nUndertale is imbued with a magic that I've only ever seen come out of Nintendo's Treehouse. The writing is on par with a Mario & Luigi or a Paper Mario. No, I'd go a step further. This is a better Mario & Luigi or Paper Mario than Nintendo's most recent installments in those two series. If you were to combine Sticker Star and Dream Team, you'd get maybe half the charm and wit that Undertale packs.\n\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't just a vehicle for the story, either. It's a hybrid turn-based action RPG exactly like any of the Super Mario ones that Nintendo puts out. Press buttons to make your attacks hit harder, or dodge incoming enemy attacks to avoid damage. Undertale's dodging system in particular is something interesting, resembling a bullet-hell shooter. You'll move your character's icon around the screen, avoiding the flurry of incoming attacks. Choosing the peaceful route will net you plenty of dodge time, seeing as most enemies aren't too keen on making peace regardless.\n\n\nThe intense bullet-hell battles climax with the game's magnificent boss fights. Each one adds a devious twist to the rules you thought you knew, suddenly messing with the game's mechanics in unique and impressive ways. And all complimented by a phenomenal soundtrack. I really could not pinpoint a favorite track or musical piece in the game because they're all so kickass, but that's not what's most impressive.\n\n\nThe quirky cast of characters that make up the various boss fights each have their own perfectly fitting boss theme that seems to fully encompass their personality and their boss fight. The adrenaline rush of a badass boss theme complimented by hell raining down on you from all angles, and then twisted around with a unique boss mechanic that completely changes the way you have to think about playing, makes for an  extremely satisfying experience. And the game consistently tops itself. Whenever you think that there's no way they could top a particular part of the game, it destroys your expectations accordingly.\n\n\nIt's the type of game that you finish and just sit there, basking in the glow of your monitor, contemplating where you could possibly go from there. Chances are whatever you play next won't make you feel the same way. Not even a sense of attachment to the game, or to the characters. But a sense of satisfaction that goes beyond simple entertainment. The feeling of a game that's communicating with you in a heartfelt and genuine manner. There's a soul to the game, a life that was born organically. It wasn't planned out at a business meeting, it wasn't a checklist on a sell-sheet. It wasn't even the by-product of a couple of crazy kids and their wild ideas to strike it rich in the indie computer game industry. It feels inspired, and it feels like it came from someone's heart. It's video games as an interactive art form.\n\n\nThere are highs, and there are lows to Undertale's overall mood. You'll swing from outrageous, stupid, and ridiculous moments right to a punch up your scrotum and into your ribcage to yank out your heart. There's twists and turns. And there's dogs, lots of dogs. And skeletons. And a motherly goat that you can flirt with. All important things that are totally relevant to the plot.\n\n\nI could give Undertale all the stars or 10/10's in the world. I could give it two thumbs up, because I only have two thumbs. But my final word on it is just a genuine plea that it be played and enjoyed by as many people as possible.\n\n\nIt's as real and genuine as a freshly baked pie from a loved one. And what kind of sick ♥♥♥♥ hates pie?\n\n\nNot playing this game is like refusing to pet a really fluffy dog. You just gotta, you know? You just gotta. Do it.\n\n\nDo it. ♥♥♥♥ing do it.","October 29, 2015","true","12.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

But, it seemed intriguing, and I finally decided to give it a try. If it wasn't for that random impulse buy, I would have missed out on a gem. This game is insanely good for how simplistic it looks on the surface. I am not too far into the game (a little past Snowdin Town), but the soundtrack, characters, the humor, and everything has been... perfect.\n\nJust beat the game (neutral to pacifist), and wow... If you haven't played this I definitely recommend it. Don't worry about that bad "aura" the game has around it based on it's toxic fanbase, this is among the best games I have played all year.\n\nThis game does something that hardly any, if at all,  games do. It takes the idea of innocence from games such as Pokemon and other child-friendly games, and it adds in some extremely dark realities to it. This allows it to be one of the few games where you really see death as it truly is.

You'll find yourself sucked in to the expertly crafted world. Your expectations will constantly be turned on their head, and there are more than a few laugh out loud moments. Characters are well written, expressive, and grow if you let them.\n\nThe game centers on the Fight or Spare mechanic. Fight and you lose everyone who could be your friend, spare and you'll discover a robust story and character development - impressive for the amount of time in which this is done.\n\nSparing works similar to demon conversations in the Shin Megami Tensei games. You have to figure out which dialog options are best for the fight to move on without combat.\n\nDodging attacks becomes a game in and of itself; youll be locked in a window as a heart, and have to bound around and dodge countless forms of attacks, many of which are absolutely inspired in how well designed they are, and how fun they are to encounter.\n\nThe soundtrack (and sound effects for that matter) has clever nods to a variety of classic games such as EarthBound, Final Fantasy, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger and so on.

I am still under an hour into the game, but the amount of intricate details placed into the game brought me to tears. Every NPC, even the random encounter enemies, feel alive; they have personality, desires, feelings and fears. It really feels like they have their own lives, lives that are completely separate from the protagonist adventures. For the first time in a long time, I honestly have the feeling... that I don't want to kill them. I don't want them to die. I want for them to live their lives and be happy. I want to protect all of them no matter the cost. Fallout is amazing for its storyline, and not necessarily by their choices (though they do play a small part in the game), but Undertale nailed the mercy/kill route to a tee. It gave me an incentive to keep them alive not by rewards, or stat point; they make me want to keep them alive because it made me genuinely care about them, their lives, and their love. I now understood why Jim Sterling gave this game a 10/10. It's a labor of love, a true testament of how much effort a man can put into a game, and make it shine like the sun and the moon. I can only wish that more people know of this game, that more people can but this game, just so the dev can make the money they deserves. Undertale definitely gets an "A" in my book, and I sincerely look forward to the Dev's next game... however long it may take.","September 22, 2015","true","10.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

[Possible Spilers]\n\nUndertale is a rare game to come along. It explores the concept of player choice, save games, 100% completionism, and morality systems in an unexpected way. It is charming, but dark. In a way Earthbound had it. There are dark moments, but remains primarily charming. There is a way to make it far less charming and that will be immediately obvious how as you play the game. The game's heart is very large and it can be very judgemental as well, but in a good way I think.\n\nAlso, you will probably find some 4-8 new favorite new characters in here. Characters are well written and interesting. The jokes are well written and funny (Except those intentionally terrible ones. Momedian. You have been warned.) A beautiful game.\n\nWhile some people liken it to Mother 3, Mother 3 is a train of emotional torment. Undertale has the heart and spirit Mother 1 and 2 in it. The charm never lets up if you take the proper path and you keep getting reasons to fight (in a way. You should avoid that button unless you wanna have a bad time). But the elements of other games such as Spec Ops (Yes), Jets and Guns (just a little), Schmups, Stanley Parable, and other games help ensure this is not just some Mother game. It is its own tale, of its own right.","September 23, 2015","true","45.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

It is an enriched game that doesn't waste the player's time on triviality without the player's consent, and usually rewards them for doing so. It is a game that can be funny, sad, heartbreaking, bittersweet, and horrifying given the way you decide to play. It has a story with depth and meaningful critique.  It has writing that is socially concious and kind to its characters without being overbearing and awkwardly saccharine. And most importantly:\n\nIt remembers you.\n\nEvery decision you make can be reflected in some way, making multiple playthoughs interesting and just as entertaining as the first. The mechanical gameplay is very simple and easy to adapt to but gets shaken up enough that staleness never quite settles in unless you're being actively punished for it by taking a stroll down the game's most violent route and even then you should be expecting an oppressive and foreboding experience. The game's numerous routes make it ever evident that it's your choice to be good or evil, and every single one impacts the game in some way that you WILL eventually feel, even if it's just a sad line in a conversation down the road. And music in the game is powerful and appropriately thematic while being most importantly: entertaining. There's no scoring, just fitting and fun tracks that do a great job of reflecting the tone of the game's numerous moments.\n\nBecause of this, I hold Undertale to be a game of talent reflected in its every corner, and the secrets it holds can keep you entertained for hours and hours. It's a game that is just a good, genuine experience with many secrets to be uncovered.","September 23, 2015","true","49.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Friends had told me to give it a try, and so I scoped it out on the Steam Store.  I was not particularly impressed with the 8-bit graphic or blunt description.  I left the Undertale store page, never thinking I would return.\n\nFast forward a couple months and I see Undertale everywhere.  No piece of the Internet is left untouched; YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter filled with posts raving about it.  Okay, okay.  Must not be that bad.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nIt. Is.  Incredible.\n\nUndertale is truly a one-of-a-kind experience.  Everything from the main characters, to NPC's, settings, and more.  All of it comes together to bring a fantastic gaming experience.\n\nPerhaps my most favorite piece of Undertale is the sountrack.  Phenomenal to say the least.  No track is out of place.\n\nThe combat system is unique.  You can choose to fight  oryou can talk it out with the monster you are battling.  There is no need for killing, which has effects on how the game pans out.\n\nLet's not forget about the story.  Driven by quirky characters and past events the story--Well, I don't want to give anything away.  Just trust me on this one.\n\nIf you have yet to play Undertale, please do not hesitate any longer.  It's only $9.99.  You won't be disappointed.

You'll find yourself sucked in to the expertly crafted world. Your expectations will constantly be turned on their head, and there are more than a few laugh out loud moments. Characters are well written, expressive, and grow if you let them.\n\nThe game centers on the Fight or Spare mechanic. Fight and you lose everyone who could be your friend, spare and you'll discover a robust story and character development - impressive for the amount of time in which this is done.\n\nSparing works similar to demon conversations in the Shin Megami Tensei games. You have to figure out which dialog options are best for the fight to move on without combat.\n\nDodging attacks becomes a game in and of itself; youll be locked in a window as a heart, and have to bound around and dodge countless forms of attacks, many of which are absolutely inspired in how well designed they are, and how fun they are to encounter.\n\nThe soundtrack (and sound effects for that matter) has clever nods to a variety of classic games such as EarthBound, Final Fantasy, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger and so on. Not to be overlooked! You'll be whistling the music for days afterward.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough!","September 19, 2015","true","15.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Friends had told me to give it a try, and so I scoped it out on the Steam Store.  I was not particularly impressed with the 8-bit graphic or blunt description.  I left the Undertale store page, never thinking I would return.\n\nFast forward a couple months and I see Undertale everywhere.  No piece of the Internet is left untouched; YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter filled with posts raving about it.  Okay, okay.  Must not be that bad.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nIt. Is.  Incredible.\n\nUndertale is truly a one-of-a-kind experience.  Everything from the main characters, to NPC's, settings, and more.  All of it comes together to bring a fantastic gaming experience.\n\nPerhaps my most favorite piece of Undertale is the sountrack.  Phenomenal to say the least.  No track is out of place.\n\nThe combat system is unique.  You can choose to fight  oryou can talk it out with the monster you are battling.  There is no need for killing, which has effects on how the game pans out.\n\nLet's not forget about the story.  Driven by quirky characters and past events the story--Well, I don't want to give anything away.  Just trust me on this one.\n\nIf you have yet to play Undertale, please do not hesitate any longer.  It's only $9.99.  You won't be disappointed.  I sure wasn't.\n\n10/10, never been more determined in my life.","January 27","true","22.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

It is an enriched game that doesn't waste the player's time on triviality without the player's consent, and usually rewards them for doing so. It is a game that can be funny, sad, heartbreaking, bittersweet, and horrifying given the way you decide to play. It has a story with depth and meaningful critique.  It has writing that is socially concious and kind to its characters without being overbearing and awkwardly saccharine. And most importantly:\n\nIt remembers you.\n\nEvery decision you make can be reflected in some way, making multiple playthoughs interesting and just as entertaining as the first. The mechanical gameplay is very simple and easy to adapt to but gets shaken up enough that staleness never quite settles in unless you're being actively punished for it by taking a stroll down the game's most violent route and even then you should be expecting an oppressive and foreboding experience. The game's numerous routes make it ever evident that it's your choice to be good or evil, and every single one impacts the game in some way that you WILL eventually feel, even if it's just a sad line in a conversation down the road. And music in the game is powerful and appropriately thematic while being most importantly: entertaining. There's no scoring, just fitting and fun tracks that do a great job of reflecting the tone of the game's numerous moments.\n\nBecause of this, I hold Undertale to be a game of talent reflected in its every corner, and the secrets it holds can keep you entertained for hours and hours. It's a game that is just a good, genuine experience with many secrets to be uncovered.","September 23, 2015","true","49.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It was very creative and I wanted to see what else they had done in the normally static pixel rpgs. I had heard of it, played the demo a while ago, and been recommended it multiple times but this got me to finally buy it. Since then I have bought it for 2 more people and have found my thoughts drifting to it often. The best way to describe the game is inspiring. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, the writing is superb, the animation is charming and impressive. But what it becomes as a package is to me the best indie game to date with many moving parts that great an experience that might be labled to outsiders as art in video game form.

I've grown so attached and fond of these characters. And I don't think I could do it, even if I tried.\n\nWhat is Undertale? You might think, it is just some kiddy rpg. But..you would be mistaken. The gameplay...is surprisingly original when it comes to the "battle" system and was definetely not what I was expecting. It was enjoyable to learn, difficult to master. And the various bosses added their own spice that kept me guessing and, a few times, fuming but I always came back for more.\n\nIt takes a lot of cues from Yumi Nikki, not a game I've personally played, but one I have seen. And the overworld exploration feels familiar, in that reguard, though this world is a lot more coherant.\nAs you explore this world you will meet many characters, some just once, and others many times. They all leave their impressions though. And some you will genuinely call friend by the end of the experience.\nYou'll laugh, you'll cry. You will smile and sigh. It's...something special.\nAnd I invite you all to be a part of it.\nPlease, join us.\nAnd please, be merciful. Love is all you need. ♥","September 17, 2015","true","33.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/universekicker/recommended/391540/","universekicker","chaser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/universekicker/","865 products in account","On the surface (no pun intended), Undertale is an rpg with a quirky twist. You don't have to kill anyone. Undertale is more than that though. It's an rpg that makes you question what you know about games, what you know about typical video game characters and tropes, what you know about yourself. Sometimes it tries a bit too hard to get this message across, but for the most part this is a game full of love. This is some of the most brilliant writing in a game ever, and it has great, interesting characters, all who feel real and have their place in the world. If you care about small details in video games, Undertale is for you. It is bursting at the seams with charm and wit. The soundtrack is also beautiful and understated. Undertale does so many things right. It does have flaws, but they're easily forgiven. Mostly it requires a bit of patience and attention for detail to truly understand what the story means, and the hundreds, possibly even thousands of in-jokes, references and secrets that the game has to offer. I felt a lot of things playing Undertale. I felt happy, I felt sad, I felt confused, I felt frustrated, but most of all I wanted to know what happened next.  I guess you could say that I was filled with determination.","November 3, 2015","true","19.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IidoTheFox/recommended/391540/","IidoTheFox","Light","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IidoTheFox/","232 products in account","Undertale is simply one of the best RPGs I have played in a very long time, and it will likely touch you and effect your emotions in ways that no RPG ever has before.\n\nThe game has two very distinct ways to play. You can kill, or you can spare. As advertised, no one has to die in this game. It is possible to spare every single enemy, even the bosses. The story alters greatly depending on how you play, and it is nigh impossible to discuss aspects of it without spoiling something, but, I can tell you it has an amazing storyline, with plenty of twists and turns. Also, while you are free to choose how you play, a pacifist (no killing) run is highly recommended. This is a game where choices truly matter.\n\nYou do not control a party in this game, rather, you control a single character. Physical combat is done through a timed-hit system, where you do more damage to monsters if you press the button on time. If going the pacifist route, then each battle is something like a negotiation. You are able to select special actions in order to interract with monsters in a non-lethal way, in order to come to a truce. Either way you cut it, the combat system in this game is truly unique, for its dodging system alone. Near the bottom of the screen is a box with a heart. When monsters attack, you get to move this heart around in order to dodge their attacks and avoid taking damage. Think a schmup title where you move in all 4 directions to avoid bullets, it is very similar to that. Boss fights almost always bring a unique effect to this as well, changing up the rules a bit on how dodging works with them, so each one feels unique and original in how they operate.\n\nThe game is also quite nice visually. Its art style is clearly inspired by the Mother series, and there are many creative and bizarre monsters that you will encounter on your journey. Each area of the game feels unique, and areas do not feel bland or repetitive in design. Monster sprites in-battle are animated, and also have a monochrome color scheme.\n\nThe soundtrack is also very nice, and is filled with all sorts of tunes. The soundtrack overall fits the game very, very well, and no piece of music really feels out of place. Music variety is also very good, and manages to capture a very wide range of emotions, something the game is good at overall.\n\nThe characters are another of the game's strong points. No two characters in this game feel the same. They all have their own unique personalities, and are all written amazingly well. Even basic NPCs in towns are all unique from one another; not one sprite is used twice, with the exception of the NPCs in a certain town, though that's a somewhat..special case, we'll say.\n\nOverall, Undertale is a fantastic game. Don't make the mistake of looking at the screenshots and thinking it's just some silly quirky RPG; it is so, so much more. It is an unforgettable journey, filled to the brim with personality, and characters you will grow to love. It is difficult to find any major flaws at all in this game. If I can think of one minor complaint, it's that the random battles can feel somewhat repetitive after a while, especially if you're going Pacifist, but this is minor, especially considering most random battles are quite short once you figure out how to win them, and they are usually not super-frequent.\n\nBuy it. Buy it now.","October 3, 2015","true","26.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

However, this WORK OF ART doesn't only build upon the pre-established conventions of the games listed prior, it innovates upon them in bold and inventive ways that I could never even conceive until I came across Undertale.\n\nNow, I could write pages and pages about the lovable cast of characters and how both hilarious and downright terrifying the world that Toby Fox created can be, but I see no reason to do that, as I'm sure that there are countless reviews  which are probably better than anything I could ever write that explain all of those things clearly.\n\nUndertale gets a well deserved 10/10.\n\nNow do yourself a favor and buy this game or I'll come over to your house and make you some spaghetti.\nIt'll be good, I promise; but nowhere near as good as this game.","September 24, 2015","true","15.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","5","6","3","1"

I don't know what I could possibly say without spoiling anything, but it's rare that a game comes along, and makes me feel, and connect so strongly with each, and every one of the characters included within the narrative. (Toriel is best GOAT mom.) The art-style I can understand as being subjective, aka not everyone's thing, but it personally clicked with me, and I feel like it perfectly compliments the game. (See LISA: The Painful RPG as another example.)  The OST is a glorious mixture of chip-tune, and more modern-esque themes. Well to put it in a much better way, the OST is one of those very rare soundtracks where every single track on the list is just magnifique. Despite being an RPG, the length for this is just the right length with the average playthrough being around 8-10 hours. The combat as well is fantasic, and very unique in how it is implemented, and you'll always need to stay alert during attacks.\n\nI guess the bit of criticism I have would be that some boss battles are a bit unclear as what you need to do to get past them in a non-lethal manner, but as I looked back at my playthrough I realized I wasn't paying enough attention to some of the hints that were being dropped.\n\nAll in all I'm still thinking about all of the characters that I've encountered, and I just want to keep going back, and interact with them even more. As a last thing I should add, while there are many games that use the Mother series as a measuring stick in how much they aspire to achieve a similar set of emotions that emerged from said series, Undertale is one of the few games that I feel that truly accomplished what it set out to do, and is one of the finest games to have been inspired by EarthBound.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say here is if you're looking for something fresh, and have fond memories for Earthbound, if this game has been in your sights lately, and you need a final push then consider this review that push, and do yourself the favor you've been meaning to do. Support this game, Support Toby Fox, Support the Indie Dev industry. All of us here would truly love to see more like this from such a creatively free industry in the future.\n\nEDIT: Beat the game for the second time at the end of 2015.

Now, if you want to know everyone else's reasons for loving this game, go ahead and scroll down. I challenge you to find a -single- bad review for this game. Why? Because this has everything you could ask for.\n\nThe story of this game is remarkably compelling- it merits replay after replay.. Not in spite of the fact that you know the story, but BECAUSE you know the story! It's like a book. The more you re-read, the more you understand, the more secrets you unlock, the more you enjoy it and feel for the characters.\n\nAnd that's what you do in this game- you feel for the characters. They're not static like in most other RPGs you find- Somehow, they seem more relatable, more alive, more -human- than most humans in other games. Where most games, you have one well-developed character, in this game, you have.... Well, I'm not going to spoil it.\n\nI would go on and on and on, and I easily could... But I will have MERCY and SPARE you the massive review. Suffice it to say this:\n\nWhile most game dev -teams- struggle to make a compelling game, somehow Tobyfox managed to make a game that eclipses all of them, practically by himself. So put that in your spaghetti. If you need some salt for it, just lean over the plate. The tears this game's storyline will give you will be salt enough.\n\n\nTen out of Ten stars. I would give it more, but that's mathematically impossible. Oh well, giving it the highest score of any review I've ever made, and am likely to ever make, is fair enough....","November 4, 2015","true","10.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Hell, maybe of the past FIVE years. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ masterpiece, and I loved every moment of it.\n\nSTORY: 10/10\n\nAnything I could say here would spoil everything. All I can say is this: It's amazingly well written, the comedy is hilarious, and the FOURTH WALL BREAKING IS ALMOST NIGHTMARISH FLOWEY YOU SACK OF SHI--\n\nSOUNDTRACK: 9/10\n\nIt's TobyFox. What did you expect? Most, if not all, of the songs are incredible. Just go to his Bandcamp and give it a listen. It's beautiful, it sounds amazing, and some of them are even ♥♥♥♥ING TERRIFYING FLOWEY YOU PIECE OF SHI--\n\nGAMEPLAY: 9/10\n\nIt blends RPG, bullet hell, and even platformer and shoot-em-up together perfectly. At some points I found myself gritting my teeth over how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t some of the attacks felt, but the bosses only used them once or twice OR A MILLION TIMES FLOWEY YOU SACK OF SHI--\n\nOVERALL: 9.5/10\n\nIt's a beautiful game. The characters feel genuine, the humor is amazing, and the story is so sad and yet so heartwarming that it might even make a grown man cry. Okay maybe not but still. BUY IT. BUY. IT. NOW.

I knew this game just by browsing around on Steam and it looked nice for me, so I decided to buy it but I couldn't buy the soundtracks sadly. I actually fully played the game without knowing the spoilers, so, I was discovering the story step by step. But I didn't know that there were 3 kind of modes, and, obviously, I started with the Neutral mode because I killed some ennemies (there are some ennemies which I didn't dare to kill them cuz they looked too cute for me).  The ending of the neutral mode really scared me. Oh my god.. When I mercied Asgore once I defeated him, Flowey appeared in a very creepy form and it kinda traumatised me lol, and plus my game got 'crashed' several times when I had to fight Flowey in his creepy form.\n\nAnd now, I fully resetted the mode and I'm going to do the Pacifist mode. And for the Genocide mode, nope, I think I would cry so much..\n\nI can tell the game has a lot of feelings, trust me. It's sometimes funny, interesting and even sad ! I even almost cried sometimes.

Yet Undertale is an experience that one will remember for quite some time. I got both "natural" and "true" endings of the game as well as read all the lore about "bad" ending. Made up some of my theories and connections that were implied and thats what makes this game great- it implies a lot of stuff yet lets you come to your own conclusions giving you parts of information.\n\nI think that ideas shown in the game were already used in some other game or movie, but no matter if I am wrong or right non the less it's still interesting to play through the game.\n\nGameplay itself is rather easy, sometimes these speech bubbles get annoying (when they are pretty much filling the space), music is nice, characters are recognizable, almost all your actions have impact on the world in one way or another which is extra nice. Price tag is rather big for a pixel isometric game by itself if you ask me, but with the fact that beating this game once will take you about 5 hours or so and with the fact that game encourages you to beat it at least two times (or more if you want to read all the possible lore yourself) price of 10 usd does not sound that much.\n\nAnd a side note that has little to no relation to game review itself.\nOverall I played this game after a huge overexposure to it on Tumblr and other social media websites. I saw dozens of lame jokes and I thought that maybe if I play the game these joke would become funny. And while in fact some of them turned out to be rather silly, huge deal of fanmade content stayed boring. Just wanted to say that if you feeling annoyed with all the things that fans are doing online and you haven't played the game yet, you might as well do it if you have spare money and time.","November 24, 2015","true","12.9"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","2"

And I may very well never play this game again. And if I do, I don't expect it to be for a long time. Of course, it is not because it was an awful game, or because it was unfulfilling, or because I have far too many games in my library that I haven't touched (I do). The opposite. This game was an amazing, wild, beautiful roller coaster of emotion and pleasure. It's been years since I wandered across a game that could have me laughing with all my heart before I felt like someone had shoved their fist into my chest cavity and squeezed that same heart. It left me smiling and on the verge of tears in just minutes of eachother.\n\nI loved every moment of it.\n\nThis game, from its minimal, but endearing art style, to its touching, clever music, to its diverse and beautiful characters. All of it had so much time, so much energy and so much, dare I say it, SOUL put into it. To me, every moment felt genuine. This is the kind of love and effort someone should put into their game. While we have Steam being flooded with half-built, unfinished money-grabs for twenty or even thirty dollars, this wanders unexpectedly into our lap. It's a diamond on par with Cave Story, or the Banner Saga, or Bastion.\n\nI told a friend I would have payed the price of the game to have everything before the titlecard and all the music. And now that I've beaten it, I can't say I would take that back. If I had to pick a list of games for my children to play (or at least my nieces and nephews), this would be on there.\n\nI'm not saying it was a perfect game. I'm not saying that it's even the BEST game put out this year. But this game grabs my number one spot for being so clever and so touching. I hope to god we can see more of this kind of thing making its way into the world, games that are more a product of time and love than they are money and ground-breaking technology.","October 21, 2015","true","14.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Mew Mew Kissey Cutie 2 is trash though. This game has so much character. Most games are just KILL. KILL. FINAL BOSS. GAME OVER. Now I'm not saying those types of games are bad, but those kind of games are (I spent 2 minutes trying to think of a word btw) simple. And the annoying thing is some people judge this game based on it's graphics. Guys. IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE GRAPHICS LIKE POKEMON OR ZELDA or something like that. I mean sure the gameplay isn't exactly god's gift to gamers but still. Also the game has a point on\nthe whole save point thing. when people do a pacifist run, some people are just curious. They are just curious enough to do a genocide run. And they just kill everyone. You feel bad. You want to go back and do the pacifist run all over again to make everyone happy. But to do that, you have to sell your SOUL to Chara. And it changes the end of the pacifist run. So this game has so many important life lessons. It has homosexual couples, Anxiety, Depression, etc. So In Conclusion, I really recommend this game. Buy it for a friend, and buy it for yourself. Sorry if this review was a little all over the place but this is the first review I've ever typed lol.\n\n\n\n* (Reading this review fills you with DETERMINATION.)\n* (HP fully restored)","March 5","true","99.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mavenofmisfortune/recommended/391540/","mavenofmisfortune","Maven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mavenofmisfortune/","105 products in account","Summary and Suggestion\nThis is, without a doubt, the best gaming experience I have had in years if not my entire life. But before you read my review or watch my videos, I heavily encourage you to play this game as blind as possible if you can and are willing. Don't look details up, don't watch playthroughs, and experience the game for yourself. Mr. Toby Fox has done an incredible job making this game an experience rather than something to beat, and you will continue to be surprised by everything from major changes to small details from playthrough to playthough.\n\n...still reading? Okay, here goes a review as spoiler-free as I can make it.\n\nGameplay\nUndertale is a game that presents itself as a classic turn-based random-encounter RPG, but it adds two unique gameplay elements. First, your defenses take the form of a bullet hell. Secondly, the game almost always offers non-violent solutions even within battle through the "Act" and "Mercy" options. By interacting with monsters based on their personalities and desires, you alter the shape of the battle. Speaking strictly gameplay-wise, this system is deep and contains all levels of challenge...if you figure out how to find them.\n\nThe game emphasizes exploration and curiousity. It begs you to try all the things and have multiple playthroughs. It asks you to act based on your feelings and shapes your experience around the type of player you are. Even doing the same type of playthrough a second time can create a different experience. The game learns and talks with you in both explicit and subtle ways, and you are expected to piece the full story together through your different encounters and possible paths. And it is worth it. No matter how deep you want to dig, the game has enough to offer.\n\nDesign and Story\nThe characters' designs are diverse and engaging, and the music and sound design emphasize each of their personalities and moods extremely well. They have varying degrees of self-awareness and often will give you hints to the game's deeper lore if you listen carefully. The story is touching and it actively seeks players who are empathetic. But the game is not for children by any means. As innocent and simple as the game may first appear, it will very quickly scare and complicate the story. And it does a good job of letting you know that early on, to prepare you.\n\nCons\nTo be honest, many of this game's cons ultimately come down to player preference. There are a few, as there always are. The game's visual design is often inconsistent due to the multitude of different artistic styles, although this did not interfere with my enjoyment of the game so much as add to the feeling of the world's diversity. Your character is meant to be as interpretable as possible in its design to allow you to fill in the blanks, but those who want to be provided a character may be disappointed with a lumpy-looking protagonist.\n\nThe game is sometimes obtuse and will not tell you when you have crossed a point of no return or altered your future game experience. This can frustrate some players as there is only one save slot. There is an extremely good REASON to only have one save slot, though, but that may not excuse the inconvenience for some. So, if you're looking for a game to play once, have the whole story, and be done with, this may not be for you.\n\nConclusion\nBeyond that, I have no complaints. I do not regret spending hours on this game or buying it for my friends. I would not be opposed to spending hours more if I would not feel guilty for doing so... I heavily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good story, music, retro RPGs, a deep experience, or a game that actively changes based on your actions. I'd try to recommend this game to people who hate those things too, but that might be asking too much.\n\nPlaythrough\nI am currently uploading and fixing a recording of my playthrough of the game to my YouTube channel. If you want to see the game in progress before purchasing, then you can check out the link below.\n\nMaven Plays Undertale","October 10, 2015","true","13.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Though it may seem simple at first, the combat quickly ramps up in difficulty to allow you to test your skills.
