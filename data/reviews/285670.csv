That's as much as I plan to fool with it for a free game I was given in apology over another game. Can't say I got to play it too much because of all the trouble, so take that as you will.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnjHGuxa1Ws\nHere's some video of what it looks like played if you're interested, or read the other reviews.\n\nHere's the error my Steam now has (going to have to reboot) where it thinks the game is still running but it's not. http://i.imgur.com/ytaqwi2.png It's not a huge thing - I just gotta reboot but it illustrates the issues.","March 11, 2014","false","4.8"," 335 of 375 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","335","375","4","27"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolfsong73/recommended/285670/","Wolfsong73","Wolfsong","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolfsong73/","121 products in account","I recommend this game with one important caveat:\n\nThe caveat is that you have the attention span, and the patience, and make a sincere effort to learn the game. If that sounds like you, this game can be very rewarding, can serve as a great introduction to the 3000AD universe, and provide you with many hours of space and planetary exploration, combat, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're the type who will hop in, spend 5 minutes blindly clicking on everything before saying "I don't know what I'm doing. This game sucks" and uninstall... you'd be better off sticking to more mainstream titles which offer more guidance. I don't say that as an insult. I say that because, like most all Derek Smart games, Galactic Command will not hold your hand, and that's exactly the way it's intended to be.\n\nI'm new to this series, myself, and have had a few false starts with this, and other 3000AD games. However, having watched videos of people on YT playing other games (such as Universal Combat and Battlecruiser Millenium), reading up on the series overall, and seeing all of what these games actually offer, I was intrigued enough to dive in and really give it a go.\n\nAfter some time of going through the tutorial, making frequent use of the in-game tutorial docs (press Ctrl-H to open it, and just H to return to the game), jotting down some of the more common commands on a notepad for easy reference, I found myself comfortable enough to navigate through space, and get down to a planet's surface myself. I still haven't dove into combat, yet. However, from the little I've done so far, I'm already seeing the potential this game has, and am excited to get into it further. I'm not using a flight stick, or a gamepad. I'm using mouse and keyboard, and am finding it quite playable. I may move on to a flight stick at a later time, but for right now, it's working for me.\n\nIf you'd like to get a good idea of what a Derek Smart game is *actually* like, go check out Lazy Chan on You Tube. Specifically, check out his series of video tutorials on Universal Combat - a game which shares the same universe and overall "feel" as Galactic Command. I watched a few of those, and it's what convinced me to really dive in and give Galactic Command a serious try. I'm glad I did.\n\nHere's a link to his first video: /watch?v=b1Lo3NK790o (just paste that after youtube.com). Again, this is of a different game from the 3000AD catalog, but it gives a good idea of what you can expect from a Derek Smart game.. *if* you actually take the time to learn and dig in.\n\nBut in all, be open-minded, and really give it a sincere try. Don't let the frequent bashing from others make up your mind for you.  And after all, the demo's free.\n\nHappy Exploring!","October 25, 2015","true","3.2"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","21","4","19","4","0"
