"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/249680/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Every once and a while there comes a game so revolutionary, so full of ambition and creativity and with such flawless execution that they forever change the medium and shape it for years to come. They are the games that we remember decades after their release, and that continue to be cited as inspiration for new games long since we first revered at their brilliance. And then we have Marlow Briggs.\n\nMarlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is not a revolutionary game; it does little if anything unique borrowing heavily from games of yore without ever outdoing them in its own right. It's not the most polish, it's production values are noticeably low, and has some truly aggravating design decisions. But none of this matters because despite being formulaic and shallow Marlow Briggs is unquestionably a blast to play. If ever there was such a thing as a B-game this is it, and what ridiculous amounts of fun it is.\n\nAs the curtain rises we find Marlow Briggs, aka "the man with large hands", arriving to visit his archaeologist girlfriend on a digsite she has been working at lately. Unfortunately, as is usually the case, the operation is in fact being run by a maniacal psychopath possessing godlike magic powers and an army of mercenaries to back him up. Marlow doesn't like this, but before he can take three step towards the door he's sent on a one way trip to Xibalba and his girlfriend kidnapped. Cue flashing lightning and a talking mask and Marlow is reborn as the sacred warrior, hero of prophecy destined to save the sacred land that has been disturbed by the militias presence.\n\nIt should be noted that all of this plays out in the span of about 60 seconds, at which point you are tossed straight into the action. This isn't a game that takes itself seriously; not remotely. The plot is absolutely absurd and the dialog cheesy beyond compare, but Marlow succeeds because it knows it's silly and revels in being as self-aware and goofy as possible as it jumps from setpiece to setpiece with little regard to exposition or the mounting continuity errors. This is a game that wants you to laugh with it not at it, with excellent (for what it is) writing and spot on delivery that made it impossible for me not to enjoy myself, grinning the whole way through.\n\nWhen Marlow and the Mask aren't cracking jokes they're smashing in skulls. It's impossible to ignore so to put it bluntly: this is a God of War clone. Right down to the distinctive way you open chests- er, collect skulls, it plays identically to Sony Santa Monica's lovechild but that really isn't a bad thing. While it isn't as refined as that series, this is a comparable action game with some highly satisfying combat and impressive bossfights. It's nothing new, but it works well for the game and more than solid, with my only complaint being a large amount of overpowered enemies and occasionally getting locked into an animation.\n\nMixed together with the melee arena combat are a plethora of action movie moments such as shooting down helicopters with a mounted turret, and some light platforming and puzzle elements. The variety is great and helped alleviate much of the monotony that otherwise would have occurred from a strictly combat focus through the 6-7 hour campaign.\n\nWhile it won't win any graphics awards, this is actually a rather decent looking title. The environments in particular have a lot of detail put into them, and when the camera pans out for a vista it's a gorgeous site. For a budget title it's pretty impressive, but what I thought was most clever was how instead of using costly animation for the cutscenes, the majority are instead done as freeze frame 3D stills that the camera then slowly sifts through, using dynamic angles and purposely placed obstructions to allow for the scene without you actually seeing them do it. It's a neat idea and I have to applaud the developers for their ingenuity, even if it's a little jarring at times.\n\nI'm not sure how many more ways I can say it at this point; Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is plain uncomplicated fun. In the same way a dumb summer blockbuster is enjoyable, Marlow doesn't need to be original or perfectly polished to be entertaining. It's a nonsensical adventure that I think almost anyone could enjoy if they can give it a chance, and quite frankly is some of the most fun I've had with any video game in a long time.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","January 30, 2014","true","5.9"," 272 of 300 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","272","300","0","6"

Making use of pretty much all of the popular clichés, the game is filled with mindless over-the-top action, tons of explosions and hilarious puns without ever taking itself seriously at any point.\n\nThe story proves this instantly: Your girlfriend translates ancient scripts for a rich company mogul somewhere in Central America. You visit her and she explains to you how her boss is up to no good because he wants to perform a ritual that would make him a powerful god and ruler of the world. So you try to take here with you back home, which her boss obviously doesn't like, so he gets you killed with an ancient scythe, not knowing that it is imbued with power that resurrects you and summons the Mask of Death, your new companion on your path to rescue your girlfriend and stop the bad boss.\n\nThe game is based on ZootFly's own proprietary, multi-platform engine called ZEN, which doesn't really provide any PC graphics options other than resolution, fullscreen and brightness. That's a shame because the game could've definitely used some AA, which would make the colorful and detailed enviroments look even better than they already do.\n\nWhile the level design as such is pretty linear, which tends to get boring after a while in a lot of games, ZootFly actually managed to add quite a lot of variety to it. Throughout the game you will encounter combat arenas, puzzles, deadly death traps, quick-reaction minigames, turret sequences and even some top-down shoot-em-up action. This sounds like a weird mix of gameplay elements but is incorporated extremely well into the game, so you never have the feeling that it is out of place.\n\nCombat and controls are exactly like what you would expect from a game like this. Throughout the story, you get access to 4 different and upgradable weapons, each of them with a variety of combos to deliver maximum damage. Additionally, by defeating the ancient gods of fire, earth, water and wind, you unlock their devastating ground attacks, which can help you out of tricky situations or simply cause widespread carnage when facing many of the varying enemies at once.\n\nThe puzzle elements in the game mostly consist of moving blocks on trigger platforms or flipping switches to open doors and while they never are overly challenging they actually provide a welcome change to the otherwise extremely fast-paced gameplay, so you can take a short break from all the action.\n\nUsually, with a low-budget title like this, the soundtrack and voice acting are two of the things where the developer tries to save money. Surprisingly enough, the soundtrack is actually pretty decent and, paired with the level design, builds up a really good atmosphere. While the dialogues are a bit cheesy at times, the voice acting itself is good and fits perfectly to the game characters, especially to Marlow and the Mask, who are constantly teasing each other verbally. That makes for some hilarious puns even in the weirdest situations. For example, while you are climbing a stone wall that is about to collapse and kill you, you are arguing with the Mask about who is whose sidekick in this game.\n\nWith around 8 hours of playtime for the story, the game provides an extremely decent bang for the buck and if you want to test your skills further, you can give the Challenge mode a shot where you replay the minigames from the story to achieve better scores and times to rank up in the online leaderboards.\n\nMarlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is cheesy. It's mindless. It's over-the-top action. But that is exactly what makes the game so enjoyable and so much fun and it's great to see some developers going bonkers with their games without trying to be serious, dramatic or mature. If something like this is right up your alley, make sure to check the game out!\n\nOh, did I mention that you can ride giant scorpions in the game?\nBecause you can!\nFRIGGIN' GIANT SCORPIONS!","November 9, 2013","true","7.7"," 69 of 76 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","69","76","0","3"

It is fantastic game in general, let alone the budget price. It has over the top action, which means plenty of explosions and crazy moments like Marlow hanging from a helicopter and he needs to dodge left or right. The game plays great, the graphics are amazing. The camera will zoom out for you to see beautiful vistas, foreboding caverns and giant industrial complexes. There is a scope and scale to this game. You can be so tiny in a grand complex and you feel it. The game really shines with its gameplay diversity. You won't just be hacking and slashing. There are fun turret sections, plenty of not too difficult platform traversal, climbing, swinging, running from boulders, pushing objects, sliding down areas, working turnstile levers and even playing a top down vertical scrolling shooter. These other elements bring a lot of diversity to break up the brawling.\n\nThe story is simple and so bad its good. You're Marlow, visiting his girlfriend in a remote jungle, so she can quit her job working for an evil madman bent on immortality. To show her he means business, he kills you right then and there to kick off the game. Marlow gets killed with a magical artifact and the mask of Death resurrects him. So now with crazy magical powers, Marlow must save his girlfriend. The mask will guide Marlow along the way. There is a lot of humor between Marlow and the mask. Its not a comedy game, but has dabs of humor here and there. Marlow Briggs knows how implausible the situation is and doesn't always take things seriously. The mask is there to aide and taunt Marlow when he dies. To show the game's humor, the antagonist is named Heng Low. He makes some great announcements throughout the game, such as, "all personnel, go grab a gun. There's a nice reward for killing Marlow Briggs. You can use that reward to pay for the weapon rental." Oh and "All employees are fired, please avoid flaming death traps and bottomless pits on your way out."\n\nThe core game play is simple. You can move, double jump, weak attack, strong attack, grapple, block, roll in any direction with the right analog stick, use magic by pressing two buttons and change weapons with the D-pad. Marlow will get four weapons throughout the game. Each weapon has a different speed, range and damage, but for the most part they are pretty much the same. When he attacks he'll swirl around, causing beautiful death. Its visually appealing. There are four spells to earn. A fiery meteor shower in a circle, earth spikes in a straight line, frost to freeze a radius of enemies and a storm. Every enemy gives you experience to upgrade your weapon and magic levels. It seems like every spell depletes all your mana. Luckily each dead enemy brings you health and mana. There is plenty of mana, health and experience around each level. You just need to hold a button to absorb it, so if an enemy is around, they can keep you from getting them. Enemies can be grappled and thrown, but more interesting, they can be converted, making them fight for you! Your block can reflect projectiles if you time it right and you have magical projectiles of your own.\n\nIt is all a nice system, made even more enjoyable by a wide cast of enemies. The standard soldiers don't use guns, just machetes since this is a hack and slash. Rocket launchers that need you to reflect. Riot troops that need to have their shields knocked away with specific attack combos. Bugs that can be easily squashed. There are plenty of mini bosses that show up in the game. First they get their own fight, but then they appear later as common enemies. When most of the mini bosses get weak, you can hop on and control them. Not like the conversion, but rode. You can ride a giant scorpion and control it to kill enemies. You can ride giants the same way. The visual is better than the actual fun. I could kill the enemies a lot quicker without being on top of slow lumbering giants.\n\nSpeaking of giants, then there are the game's big bosses. The bosses so big that you're as tall as a single eye. Each big boss has many parts and they're quite memorable. Its all simple pattern recognition though so its easy enough once you figure out the pattern. The only problem is that you don't do much damage. At the end there is even a quick time event or mash the grapple button.\n\nYou have NO control over the camera. It is always carefully placed and follows you well enough. I only had a problem with that once or twice in the whole game. The load times are hid. I didn't notice one at all unless I came back to a save. Dying has a really quick reload time to the point its just a quote, then you respawn from the last frequent checkpoint. Its so nice to be back in the action.\n\nTo keep things interesting, there are challenges in the game. Things like you're sliding down a hill and need to move left and right. The challenge is collecting all the experience orbs! Don't collect them all? You can restart or just keep playing. You can kill all the helicopters in the turret section or the town down shooter section. It adds an extra level of challenge to what would be an easy game on normal (medium) difficulty. Even though the game stays the same level of difficulty, the later areas just take longer. Bigger enemies take more damage. Puzzles take longer.\n\nOther elements in the game have players jumping between three mine carts to avoid obstacles. Floating with angels wings between platforms. Swimming through a swinging guillotine river. Climbing wall vines, killing worms. Inching with Marlow's back to the wall to avoid either falling or gears. Clinging to cliff sides. Dodging flaming wrecking balls. Turret shooting the pistons on a giant lava scooper as you ride around a cart. Getting chased by helicopters. Seeing giant scorpions get crushed by huge boulders completely unscripted. Escaping under a door by rolling just before spikes crushed the enemies in the room. Fighting enemies on a helipad as it flipped and flew through the air.  Seeing the giant facility Marlow is in was really mobile with treads.\n\nIt all feels like a high budget game in a lot of ways, but lacking in a few, especially the cut scenes. There aren't many animated cut scenes, but the majority of the scenes are fly around of scenes. Its like bullet time. You'll see a still frame circling around Marlow as he's hacked through a flame throwing soldier. As the camera swings around, it will reveal a helicopter. Then Marlow leaping from the copter, only to swing around and show Marlow slashing through an insect.  I'm happy that the cut scenes are the worst part of the game, especially since they're skipable. They spent the time in the animation, character models and gameplay.\n\nThe game is well worth the $5 price tag it currently has. I am shocked this game doesn't have a cult following or more popularity. Even with a 7 hour run time and not too much frills for any replay value, I think this could stand shoulder to shoulder with God of War. The diversity really kept me engaged. Nothing overstayed its welcome. 7 hours was the right time. Its best to leave players wanting more. Odd now Steam says that I only played 5 hours.

To top it off Marlow is a lovable hero unlike that moronic man-child Kratos, and to top it off he's the kind of diverse ethincy video character that AAA games sadly shy away from.\nIn addition, despite being a low budget game, the developers did an EXCELLENT job with some of the scenery and set pieces (check my online album of the game on Steam for some examples).\n\nThe game's plot is simple:\nLo Pan kidnaps Marlow's woman and leaves him for dead by having an ancient scythe weapon lodged onto Marlow's chest. Unbeknownst to Lo Pan, the scythe then resurrects Marlow with the help of an ancient Incan (or Mayan, I forget) King, shown in this game as being a disembodied skull voiced by Steve Blum.\n\nAs Marlow travels to save his love, he gains more weapons and abilities to waste Lo Pan's army and the nightmarish oversized insects and phantoms that get in his way.\n\nI'd recommend playing on Easy, because enemies tend to take a lot of hits before they die on Normal.","June 19, 2014","true","6.3"," 60 of 82 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","60","82","0","1"

I suppose you could compare this game to legends like God of War although it doesn't have the brutality associate with God of War so you won't be tearing your hair in frustration but instead can enjoy this game in peace.\n\nAlong the way witness the dynamic duo of Marlow and the titular Mask of Death as they trade banter while killing enemies, facing monstrous creatures and wielding terrible weapons.\n\nGraphics\nYou probably won't believe how beautiful this game is despite the fact that it merely clocks at 2gb something in terms of size, fauna has a beautiful sheen to it, enemies and environment has beautiful and varied art to them and you will visit many location each [barring the temples] has their own art style and colour.\n\nMusic\nIt's awesome, its  beaty track that fits well with the game and doesn't sound out of place, especially when you face some of the bosses. It's great.\n\nGameplay\nAnd here is where MBATMOD shines the most, you will wield many different [actually just four but they are all different in how they play.] weapons, traverse many different locale and best of all, fight tons of enemies all with satisfying combo.\n\nGranted I don't actually know why its more important to string longer combos since  I don't actually notice any increase in reward but damn I would say its not that hard to pull off 100-200 combos by late game as your skill greatly outclass that of the enemies.\n\nEnemies aren't dull dullard either, they will put up a stiff fight and unless you actually use those combos you will find yourself always running out of health and mana. Fun thing is killing enemies restore the meters albeit very very little. It's a fine system of risk of reward which is greatly enhanced by the fact that healing takes time and you can't just do that in the middle of a brawl with 10+ dudes so caution must be taken. One fun ability they give you in game is the ability to convert humanoid size enemies to your side by grabbing them and spamming the E button. Granted they do die quickly and are usually relegated to meatshield duty but I'll be damn if they didn't save my hide once when I got trapped in an arena with two hulking dudes and 2 never ending spawning enemies, which I proceed to convert naturally.\n\nDid i mention boss fights are aplenty? Yes they are, and they are awesome, you will fight mythical creature, twisted monster and the demons of the underworld itself! Of course cleverly they disguise the mini boss fight as a tutorial segment to deal with the enemy type later.\n\nSo about controls, its very good and responsive. So far none of my button has mispressed. Although one issue with the game is the camera can be a backstabbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ occasionally, It might swing behind you, in front of you or even block your off-screen view. I guess there has to be a con no?\n\n+Awesome gameplay\n+Killer Graphic\n+Responsive combat and control\n+Great enemies\n+Actually smart AI\n\n+/-Occasional Copypasted levels\n+/-Repetitive levels before the next carrot stick appears\n\n-Terrible Camera\n-The camera, its awful\n\nConclusion\nSo MBATMoD, lets tick the checklist shall we? Great cheesy story, awesome gameplay and enemies and a game that actually understands the meaning of action adventure by shooting you across the world at breakneck speed. I'll give this little bugger a medal and for you I will presribe a  dose of this awesome game.\n\nPRICE THE GAME IS SUPER CHEAP DAMMIT! BUY IT ALREADY!

It's just mindless fun.\nDecent amount of different enemies.\nReally cheap during a Steam Sale.\nCons\nDuring the last third, the game just throws miniboss after miniboss at you, which gets tiring\nLevels are not that well designed. For example, there are losts of safe points where you can attack your enemies but they can't hit you, and sometimes if you're lucky freezing some of them close to a ledge will make them fall even if they aren't supposed to.\nVeredict\nProbably the best paid game you can get on Steam for a dollar or less (during a Sale). Might get a bit repetitive towards the end and you can pretty much beat every fight using just two or three different combos and dodging, but if you're just looking for a fun, cheap God of War-like that doesn't overstay it's welcome, buy this game.","October 28, 2014","true","12.9"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","29","34","0","0"

A few glitches but nothing to detract from the entertaining game-play.  The game stays fresh throughout thoughtfully mixing platforming, melee, magic summoning and mini games.   A comedic thread is established early and is maintained as the shirtless black male muscular protagonist frequently converses humorously with a witty spirit of another realm.   The neoteric presentation characterized by an application controlled camera could of been an abject failure but instead provides for some alluring game-play perspectives.

And, I have to admit, it's actually damn fun to play.\n\nMarlow plays like some sort of Devil May Cry or God Of War, but where these other games usually take a little break inbetween the action packed moments Marlow moves full speed ahead. There's hardly ever a dull moment in this game. You move from one crazy action packed scene to the next, with usually just a few seconds of breathing room before hacking away at the next group of enemies.\n\nThis game isn't extremely long, about 5-6 hours, which is more than enough. After finishing it you're probably done with it anyway. It's fun for a first playthrough, then you'll just delete if off your PC most likely. It doesn't have any replay value. Which might actually be the reason why it's just non-stop action.\n\nThe graphics look good, the voice acting is decent and the gameplay solid.\nMarlow Briggs is something you just have to play if you love action games. Especially considering the price these days.\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","November 21, 2013","true","5.9"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","31","40","0","0"

The corny acting, the even cornier lines, the dumbed down hack & slash mechanics, and the hilariously stupid plot all serve one thing: to let you have a great time.\n\nLong version:Steam is full of bad games. And while Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is undoubtedly a bad game, what makes it stand out in the sea of Greenlight schlock is that it was designed to be a bad game: which suddenly elevates it into so-bad-it-is-actually-great status.\nLet me explain.\n\nWhen you play a bad game, you often get frustrated because of bad level design or game mechanics, or bad controls. Or even worse, the game is downright boring. With Marlow Briggs, you will hardly ever get bored: it is a platformer, a hack & slash, a rail shooter, and a shoot ‘em up– all packed into one explosive pack of joy. Sure, some of the platforming levels are repetitive and the camera tends to kill you more than the bosses, but there are so many minigames and shooter sections that you will never, ever get bored.\n\nThe game mechanics are simple as a brick: you have a jump button, normal and a power attack, and a few spells. They form dozens of combos, but they cannot hide the fact that Marlow Briggs is played by mashing two buttons as fast as you can. Combat is strangely satisfying though with good enemy design and one of the most balanced difficulty sliders I saw in a long time.\n\nThe cherry on top of this rather delicious action cake is the story. You cannot name a single 90s action movie cliché or one-liner that isn’t here in some form, and there are more explosions than in Michael Bay’s entire filmography. All completed with a voice acting hammier than a pig farm; it is hilariously terrible and you will probably find yourself unable to not laugh at it, just like how the developers intended.","October 9, 2015","true","16.4"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","31","40","6","3"

It is self-aware as can be, knowing it's a lot of nonsense. Marlow is armed with its crazy, ridiculous, and off-the-wall story: Marlow dies and is brought back to life to avenge his death, to save his girlfriend Eva, and stop a corrupt man from trying to rule the world. If that isn't enough - Marlow is constantly making a barrage of in-jokes aimed at video-games in general, action movies + games, and other things of that sort; and tons of non-stop action + explosions. And for most of this action/platforming game - what nonsense it is! Marlow is just tons of fun and will make you grin + smile, most of the time.\n\nMost of the time, constanly running at 60 frames per second on my PC (i7 950; GF GTX 560 Ti; 8 GB RAM; Win 7 64-bit) - Marlow runs extremely well. Very rarely did it even drop below 60! Not only that - but the art-direction + technical graphics are surprisingly actually good here, as well. Marlow's non-stop barrage of action feels fantastic in the controls department with an XBox 360 Controller, playing and feeling very similar to the Darksiders series - which is fantastic! Combat feels + looks smooth, fast, and always is on point! If you're into action-games like the Darksiders (which many feel is similar to God Of War series, which I don't have and haven't played b/c I am a PC gamer) - you'll probably feel right at home with Marlow.\n\nJust when you think you've had your fill of using a certain weapon or skill, expect more to suddenly come your way. Expect a suddeny upgrade to a skill or new game-mechanic introduced. And if this isn't enough - Marlow has mini-games of collecting objects in a race-like manner (which can be compared to on the Leaderboards); and even a mini-heliocopter game that feel like a throwback to Capcom's 1942 + Taito's Sky Shark. Marlow will constantly surprise the player with things like this, from in-jokes to game-references.\n\nIf this sounds up your alley, Marlow is sure to put a lot of cheesy smiles on the face of gamers. That is, until the last few levels come around, when the game decides to severely spike up in difficulty. Regardless, since most of your time spent for the 6-10 hours this campaign should last you (took me a bit longer than 10 hours b/c some areas were a bit frustrating to get though), Marlow is going to deliver a riotous, ridiculous, hilarious, and very fun action-packed roller-coaster ride of a game!\n\nFinal Grade = C+.","October 25, 2014","true","11.7"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

You have everything you can expect from an action movie/game so you just need to sit back and relax while having to face many dangerous creatures and soldiers in order to save the one you love. Marlow never wanted to be a hero, he just want to end all this madness and get his girlfriend back.\n\nYou will have a small variety of weapons and magic tricks that you will learn or get as you progress the game. With simple combos reminding the God of Wars series (without the gory aspect or the budget) you can expect a couples of puzzles as well but they may not represent a challenge if you are a fan of such things. The goal in this game is nothing new or refreshing. Marlow Briggs never taking things too seriously and the plot is really obvious about this. From explosive red barrels that are very well placed to being made fun when you fail a single jump, everything feels like a lot of things you have seen before and there’s nothing wrong with that.\n\nThe game played great without no issues and the visuals are actually quite nice. The colors are bright and vibrant and there’s a decent balance between those levels around the forest and the industrial area. I finished the game in around 6 hours and I had a decent amount of fun. It was a game that made right from the start that did not wanted to being taken seriously and they achieved that goal without flinching. If you like to play more than one game at the time and you are playing something horror related or very story heavy, Marlow Briggs is just the right thing to play between such titles.\n\nSilliness is guaranteed as well mindless fun.\n","June 7, 2015","true","6.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

And to be clear, the graphics are a little sloppy, the game-play is straight out of God of War, the "plot" is B-movie fluff, and there are no Steam trading cards for this title. On the other hand...\n\nMarlow Briggs is AMAZING! It completely embraces the cheesiness of its premise, and delivers absurdly over-the-top action on a scale unheard of in most video games. Through it all the protagonist delivers a ton of action movie one-liners and amusing meta-commentary on the number of puzzles involving spikes, swinging blades, and fire. Instead of long, boring cut-scenes, we get cool "freeze frame" moments, with the camera swooping and panning around the frozen tableau as Marlow Briggs defeats an army of giant bugs, or cuts a helicopter in half, or survives the explosion of a cruise-ship-sized mining vehicle. It's also nice to see a black guy as the protagonist, with no one else in the game making a big deal out of it.\n\nThere is nothing new or original in this package, so don't expect it to change the definition of gaming.

Reminded me of something Nick Cage might do.\n\nThis is an over the top character action game with all the tropes and mechanics you've come to expect. X and Y weak/strong attacks strung into combos. 4 different weapons types. Standard med speed/med damage/med range(sword type), fast/short range/med damage(dagger type), fast/long range/low damage(chain type) and Slow/low range/high damage(hammer type). As well as elemental magic attacks. Though these do more or less the same thing except the ice one. Powerful AOE attack.\n\nIts got block puzzles, its got platforming, ledge grabbing, timed based swings and jumps. It also has a really weird and out of place vertically scrolling shooter that happens more than once.\n\nThe banter between the main character and the mask that gives the character powers is actually funny at times and very self aware. It never really gets in the way or become annoying.\n\nIt's paced pretty well, at the end it drags a little (but only a little). Maybe it over stays its welcome by a small unit of measurement. If it were maybe 4-5 hours long it'd be perfect. 6 or more if you're a completionist seems just enough to make me mention the length might be an issue.\n\nIt's more inspired by God of War mechanically but the aesthetics are pretty much Uncharted with some industrial zones. Even down to the Health Orbs being red, magic orbs being blue and XP orbs being gold/yellowish. Not to mention the right analog "push in direction to roll that way dodge)\n\nDecent romp and palate cleanser, especially for $5.","January 23, 2015","true","5.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/249680/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is the equivalent of a B-movie from the 1980s and 1990s. It is so bad it is good. It is clearly a low budget game that is not a breakthrough for the game industry or the game’s genre. However, this game provides plenty of fun from the beginning. The gameplay feels varied enough as you traverse different settings in the same country and the action never lets up.\n\nMarlow Briggs is a smokejumper who goes on vacation outside the U.S. to a Spanish speaking country. I initially thought it was Mexico, but it could have been Central or South America based on the jungles and the rich history of the indigenous people. He is with his girlfriend, an archeologist who is kidnapped by an Asian madman, Heng Long, with godlike magical powers who seems bent on taking over the world. This madman kills Marlow Briggs with a mythical weapon, but he is reborn by a Mayan mask proclaiming him to be the sacred warrior who must save the sacred land. Long is backed up by an army of mercenaries of varying levels of difficulty. Marlow goes to fight to save the land for the Mayan mask and to save his girlfriend. It becomes apparent that this plot is formulaic and unoriginal but this game can get away with it because of its X factor: entertainment value.\n\nOnce Marlow goes to work the plot takes a backseat and the real fun begins. Marlow begins with the same weapon used to kill him. It has short range, but it cuts good. The gameplay seems to borrow elements from the Tomb Raider series and God of War. The mercenaries may seem repetitive at times, but it does not detract from the fun that combat provides. The Mayan mask becomes Marlow’s sidekick, cracking cheesy jokes along the way. While the combat is mainly melee Marlow is introduced to magic spells that require full or near full levels of mana. There are red masks for health regeneration and blue masks for mana regeneration. The red and blue masks are generously placed in areas of intense combat. Therefore, it is easy to regenerate health and mana after the combat is over. There are also new weapons to use that slice better and have more range than the first weapon of the game. Sometimes Marlow sounds like an action hero from a cheesy action film when fighting saying things like “Aw yeah, class is in session.” His acrobatics are well animated, whether in combat or jumping from one section to another.\n\nThere are many bosses that Marlow Briggs must face. I think they are quite impressive and require you to figure out their moves so that you can best fight them without taking damage in return. The boss fights seem to ensure that you put as much importance in your defensive moves as you do in your offensive moves. It becomes important to damage your toughest foes without taking so much damage in return. The battles with the ordinary mercenaries are the ones that feel a little repetitive as you advance through the game. The animations of all the mercenaries are impressive and look realistic.\n\nThere are platforming aspects to this game, much like the Tomb Raider games. There are plenty of puzzles, some timed whereas others are not timed. Some puzzles require you to jump around a lot to reach the next destination. Other puzzles require you to move boxes to open doors or gain access to boxes that can lead to higher levels. The puzzles are really none too complicated to solve. There sceneries are not the best in terms of graphics, but they are respectable with enough detail to look realistic, especially for a low budget game. Eventually, Marlow will be able to glide (fly) from one platform to another since double jumps will not always be good enough. There is also a break in the melee action when Marlow is required to shoot stationary guns to shoot down choppers. There are also challenges that require you to shoot down aircraft in top-down style.\n\nThe one gripe I have about this game is the fixed camera angles. The camera angles are inflexible and awkward as they do not allow for much viewing freedom. This can lead to some frustrations such as jumping and falling to your death. Eventually, I got over the problem with these camera angles. It feels like an unrefined aspect of this game, but it is not so bad that it would ruin the game. The developers at ZootFly can sure use tips from Crystal Dynamics, the developers of Tomb Raider, on how to best apply camera angles in a game that features platform jumping and puzzle solving. Also, there are times when the camera obstructs your view when fighting two very large Juggernauts of Chabtan. One comes after me while I can’t see what the other one is doing.\n\nI think Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death deserved more popularity than it got. It is a solid action game with plenty of fun gameplay that never reaches boredom. I recommend this game to anyone. At a price of $4.99 you cannot go wrong with this game.\n\nMy Score: 7/10\n","April 8","true","42.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I wouldn't recommend it at full price, but if you're looking for a quite fun casual action game, god of war style, it's worth the money at a sale if you set your expectations according to the price level.\n\nThe game starts off right away with almost no plot, just start killing bad guys, god of war style. The plot is very thin, as well as the characters in the game.\n\nThe graphics look great, especially considering the price, and there's lots of action all the time, so you'll get treated to a lot of high paced nice looking action. It's like an over the top action adventure movie.\n\nEven though you have  a few different combos and get different weapons as the game progresses, combat isn't deep at all, you can just button mash through the whole game. Don't play it for longer stretches than an hour or so, or the repetitive nature of the game gets evident.\n\nThe game is best played casually half an hour to an hour at the time, that way it's quite fun to return to it, if you set your mind to mindless action, and don't expect a story line worth the name or deep gameplay elements.\n\nThe game is quite easy, I only got stuck on a few jumping sequences which were a bit annoying, otherwise the game has quite a smooth difficulty setting, making it quite fun but not too much of a challenge.","December 27, 2014","true","8.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

As the description of the game says: "Fight the asian menace!", which obviously refers to the gigantic "Anime" monopoly the asians lavish in, whose market they're trying to push into the virgin and lush lands of South America, and use the vast riches found there to produce radioactive enriched anime tapes and manga books to attack the innocent citizens of America. Thus the main character has to stop their plans and make them fall back into their foxholes in Iwo Jima by showing them how a third nuke would've been.\n\nThe gameplay is an excellent example of how western companies should battle eastern developers with combat mechanics that not only rival, but are hundreds of times better than the so overrated eastern rpgs like Dark Souls. The players has to fight back deadly banzai charges performed by over-zeaoulous japanese samurai guerrillas and mutated beasts product of the secret nuclear experiments in Fukushima.","June 24, 2014","true","0.3"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","19","34","0","2"

This is a great hack and slash in the same style as God of War, but in an action movie motif that screams 'Big Trouble in Little China' homage. Much like the 80s film, the hero (who may be the sidekick depending on opinion) is thrust into saving his girlfriend from the villain, voiced by James Hong who is once again typecast as the asian man who's trying to use a girl for a crazy ritual.\n\nThere's four weapons and four magic spells you can use. All of which level up quite quickly in the somewhat basic upgrade menu. What's a game without a tacked on upgrade system, mirite? It's not bad, but it has no fancy skill trees or anything.\n\nThe writing isn't the best, but it is entertaining. Especially the dialogue between Marlow and the floating Mayan mask he talks to. The voices are good in the sense that they're over the top and fit the style that the game is going for.\n\nThe pacing is great. A nice mix of platforming, combat, puzzles, wall climbing, sliding, and on rail shooting. They're spread out to keep things interesing as you progress. The combat itself is also pretty good. It doesn't feel sloppy or cheap. Good PC hack and slash titles are few and far between and this is one that I'm glad I got to play.\n\nIt's totally worth a purchase and playthrough.","April 1, 2014","true","8.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

In fact, there are only 2 other games that I would consider to be perfect 10s: the original portal Daikatana and pacman ce dx Shrek Treasure Hunt. Those aren't necessarily the best games I've played, but they are the most perfect, if that makes sense. And that is a word that I would use to describe Gone Home Marlow Briggs: perfect. It is a game purely comprised of exploration and discovery, with virtually no other gameplay components with the exception of some very simplistic puzzles. And yet, Gone Home Marlow Briggs manages to make seemingly mundane exploration into some of the most engaging and emotional storytelling I have ever seen.\n\nGone Home Marlow Briggs will be remembered for its brilliant design and execution, but also as a game that bravely led the charge in addressing contemporary social issues that have not as of yet found much representation in the medium.\n\nThis game is not for everyone. If all you play are shooters and fast paced action games, then Gone Home Marlow Briggs will bore you. However, if you like slower games or games with interesting ways of telling stories, such as Journey, Heavy Rain, Dear Esther, or even mods like The Stanley Parable Call Of Duty: World At War, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, Call of Duty 2: Big Red One or even James Ponds, than Gone Home Marlow Briggs is certain to grab you and not let go for its 3 7 hour duration.\n","June 28, 2014","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I clicked on Marlow Briggs just for the heck of it, expecting to see tons of negative reviews...... but they were pretty much all positive, and said the game was like God of War, but for (during Summer Sale right now) 99 cents. I bought it immediately.\nIt's a fantastic game. It has amusing characters like Marlow and the Mexican god who guides him. There's Long, the villain, and  Marlow Brigg's assassin who teams up with him during his afterlife. The plot is average, but doesn't matter much in this type of game. You can tell production budget was somewhat low, but they still managed to get moments that are far more epic than $60 shooters. The graphics are fair and some of the views (such as of ancient temples and towns, plus the factory) are beautiful. It is like God of War in every way, and that is a good thing. You get new weapons as you go along, and you can upgrade these weapons. With new weapons comes new moves and more options during combat. You also get new mega-powers, such as summoning a hailstorm of lava or creating a blizzard that freeze enemies. Along with weapons and powers, you also get to fight new enemies with harder and harder difficulty. In addition, there are many different environments and fun mini games to play. Did I mention you can save whenever you want?\nThis game is 99 cents during sale, and it is worth every penny.

Now, bump it up to Hardcore and you're in for a challenge, except I'm now wondering if I had figured how to get the game to switch weapons sooner (Tab key doesn't work for me, I had to use the individual number keys), if it would've been easier. There is also a serviceable amount of platforming and puzzle-solving, though nothing any seasoned player will be stuck on for very long (with maybe an exception here or there).\n\nAnyway, the game is fast-paced, action-packed, and has lots of explosions and goofball banter between the main character and his floating Mayan mask spirit helper, and just about every action game cliche that's been invented in the past decade - bullet time, QTEs, slow-mo special moves, massive combo attacks, mini-game sequences - you name it, it's probably in here. Once you're past the factory settings near the beginning and into the Mayan jungles, it becomes one feast for the eyes after another (screenshots do not do it justice).\n\nThe game frequently goes on sale for around $1-$3, and if God of War clones or action games in general are your thing, I can easily recommend it for that. Even the current store price of $5 isn't a bad deal for it, but since I found it easy, I imagine that people who are more used to playing games of this genre than me might blow through it quickly, even on Hardcore.\n\nRating: 3.5/5","September 8, 2014","true","25.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game's pace is frantic and non-stop from beginning to end switching you between combat sequences, platforming, rail shooting, sliding sequences and even SHUMP sections with the only lull being the games three puzzles.\n\nThe game looks surprisingly good for its $15 price tag with some notable backdrops looking really impressive, combat animations that flow nicely and a solid framerate throughout its entirety. However animations in the few cutscenes that are actually fully animated look really janky and awkward which is probably why they opted to do panning/ stop motion type sequences for most of their cutscenes which are unique and work quite well.\n\nWhere the game really shines though is its dialogue and sense of humor which is as plentiful and quickly paced as everything else in this game.\n\nIf you enjoy character action games or humorous over the top action stories you will definitely want to check this out.","January 4, 2014","true","6.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Then again, at least it's not a puzzle platformer! Honestly though, Marlow Briggs isn't all that bad as long as you don't mind the linearity.\n\nI have to say I have absolutely no idea where Marlow Briggs comes from, whether it's a franchise of some sorts or simply a new IP. What I do know is that it features a badass-looking African-American main character full of buff and somewhat lacking in smarts. As it happens Mr. Briggs decided to drop in an visit his sweetheart at the dig site where she works, spend some quality holiday time together. As it also happens, his sweetheart works for an unscrupulous mafia boss hell-bent on becoming a god. What follows is a standard man rescues woman plot, though in this case it's filled with cheesy jokes and commentary from the characters as well as lots of over-the-top action and destruction. Think 90's action movies maybe - big unbelievable machines, lots of explosions, and an evil mastermind who just can't help commenting on the main character's progress (and his own failures).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=197082945\n\nIn terms of game mechanics there isn't all that much here that hasn't been done before. Lots of running and jumping and avoiding various implements of death, a significant number of speed slaloming sections too. A few puzzles involving pressure-plates and levers too, though they're pretty easy to grasp and rather annoying to execute at times. A lot of those are also timer-based which only makes it more frustrating. Possibly to compensate for this there are a few turret sections and some top-down plane shmup sections too.\n\nCombat is based on combos composed of light and heavy attack mixes, though I have to give credit to the ingame combo tutor. In more detail there are 4 weapons that cover the usual variety - a standard balanced weapon, a set of daggers with high speed but low attack, a whip with massive range and rate of attack but even lower attack, and a massive scythe that probably should've been a sledgehammer given its slow but devastating attack. On top of that there are 4 types of magic - Fire, Earth, Water, and Wind - and a quickfire homing magic missile. Creep-wise there are several standard varieties - including but not limited to shield-bearers, heavies, giants, gunners, or huge scorpions - sadly those feel more like a chore past the few initial encounters. Every now and then a boss comes along (5 times, to be precise) and things get more entertaining.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=193176104\n\nVisually it's a decent offering, the models look plenty detailed and the environments are rich and vibrant. And I really mean this - initially there are massive excavation machines that resemble moving fortresses more than anything and later on lots of ruins and jungle and mountains. Maybe the textures don't hold up to AAA games upon closer inspection but overall there's nothing to complain about.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=226996285\n\nAnimation-wise there doesn't seem much to complain about, attacks look smooth and interrupts are more than an instant transition to a hit pose. Of particular note is the unusual style that some of the cutscenes are done it - stop-motion frames! It's kinda like what Batman: Arkham Asylum/City did - a series of snapshots of a 3D scene brimming with action an momentum. Hard to describe but pretty successful.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=192811453\n\nNow on the audio side things are not as pretty though. There are a TON of dialogues and voiced chatter, and it's not the worst it could be. The main character actually sounds pretty decent, as does the main villain. However, I personally had issues and very few voice-overs actually played. If it wasn't for the subtitles I'd have no idea someone was talking.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=231662424\n\nThe only other big gripe I had with this title was the camera. I found the camera mighty awkward most of the time and there is no way to actually adjust the camera manually! This ties in into finding hidden bonuses and collectibles I suppose but those are few and far between to actually warrant that. And it's not like the camera actually follows behind at all times, nope, the angle seems to be pre-defined in most zones/areas/corridors.\n\n\nInitially I wasn't sure I'd stick through to the end. I've seen TotalBiscuit's WTF Is.. on Marlow Briggs and got hooked. Then I fired it up and noticed the missing voice-overs. And this somewhat killed the mood for me. With the voice overs (and given their frequency) the game would've been pretty engaging, as it was it turned into a rather mundane experience. Nevertheless, Marlow Briggs is a decent enough action adventure - as long as you're not expecting too much. Darksiders or DmC this is not, after all.","February 25, 2014","true","12.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

Perhaps this game.  Admitedly its similarities with batman are only its slick combat, combo, weapons and powers system though without that the batman games are mostly just cool set pieces.  It picks up alot of tomb raider vibes in its well done platforming and puzzles etc.  What this game also has is a ♥♥♥♥ load of b-movie humour delivered by Steve Blum as the ancient aztec death mask who really does some of his finest work in this game.\n\nThis game also has a failry unique setting besides the ancient ruins in the shape of monsterous industrial machines, facilities that blanket the jungle regions, like the keystone pipeline with a penchant for outofthisworld steroids.  The games weapon and power progression is straightforward and matches the slick gameplay.  This is probably in the top 10 platformers/beat-em-ups i've ever played though admittedly my console days are long behind me.  Still this game actually works perfectly fine with mouse and keyboard, though i could see some preferring to use a controller.\n\nThe games humour and slick combat and platforming though are why people should play this game, and based on the nearly all positive steam reviews I'm not alone.  Also at around 6 hours or so its a nice diversion from other game types.  It was also just another amusement to peruse the achivements and notice an achievement for skipping all in game cutscenes in a single playthrough...oh game.

There are also limited puzzles,\nand a few turret sections.  The music, while respectable, was not used appropriately\nto emphasize action or atmosphere as you progress through the game.  There are\nleaderboards for those that enjoy them, and challenge areas that require a different\nstyle of combat both to change up the standard hack and slash feel, and to offer\na harder level of difficulty for those looking to increase their leaderboard rankings.\n\nThe graphics look good, and the story is decent,\nwith eclectic comedic aspects that come off as more corny than the game was trying for.\nThe game doesn't take itself too seriously, which is good, but it has clung to certain\nstereotypes such as "rescue the princess" that are overdone in many adventure games.\n\nThe level design is vast and impressive, but there is a certain suspension of\ndisbelief required in the physics.   Some may find no fault in a full on battle while\nflying through the air, but most would probably question how the characters aren't\nthrown to their deaths.  The platforming is where this game excels in content.\nThey are designed very well, and you will spend more time platforming through the world\nthan doing anything else. There is a major problem with the camera angle, however, making it\ndifficult to see distances when platforming, and seeing enemies due to the angle.  it\ntakes away from the immersion into the game, and requiring memorization of challenges\nrather than going with the flow of the adventure.  I go more in depth into this\nproblem in the video for those that would like a visual example.\n\nThe combat in the game falls short of what it could be;  the weapons all\nessentially do the same thing, with differences in range or speed.  As you progress\nthrough the game, the enemies require more button smashing to defeat rather than any\ntactics or response to their abilities.  There are spells in the game, but they all\ncost an excessive amount of mana, couldn't be used often, and have little effect or\ndamage to the enemy, taking away from the fluidity of the game.\n\nThe game has good graphics, but has a lot of issues.  The story doesn't propel\nyou forward, and doesn't encourage an emotional connection.  The battles lack fluidity\nand the camera view makes it more repetitive than immersive.  I never felt the game\nwas wasting my time, but I felt it was more boring than challenging.  You spend more\ntime platforming through the world than in combat.  If you expect more from games, then\ngood chance you will not enjoy this game, but if you are easily amused then this should\nbe good enough for you to enjoy.\n\nFor more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basic summary of\nwhat I cover in my video.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","November 20, 2014","true","8.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Inspired (very, very heavily.  Like, "watch out for copyright lawsuits" heavily) by God of War 2, a game already known by all men with booming voices, beards, and indescribable road rage, this is the tale of Marlow Briggs.  See, Marlow isn't just your regular old barrel-chested he-man.  He fights fires.  Not to be confused with spraying water on burning buildings, no.  Before you have ever even picked up the controller, Marlow Briggs has had a history of going mano-e-mano with towering pillars of flame.  Fists only.  No items.  Final Destination.  By the time your dainty, effeminate hands have laid themselves down on the controller (play it with a controller, it's a console type of action game), he has had sexual intercourse with more women than you have ever seen, including your mother and all of your sisters over the age of 18, though the underage ones still jill off to him.  Over the course of the next few hours, you will direct his wrath at a menagerie of mercenaries and Aztec horrors all over a Central American jungle.  Even though I was already an adult male, this game put me through a second, much stronger puberty.  My testicles dangle like anvils with a sweater on them, my booming voice shatters windows and sends girly men screaming to the ground, and my muscles got so big that even wearing a muscle shirt still costs the GDP of a small African country.

This is a God of War/DMC cheap clone that at 5 bucks (or less on sale) is a steal. Self aware, absurd, and beyond stupid in the best, over the top, 80's style action possible.\n\n+/- Graphics - for a budget title, graphics are really good. Lip synching isn't the best, bust graphics are bright and fun, matching the over the top atmosphere. Explosions about, and everything just works. Some environments are repetitive, and there could be more enemy variety, but what does exist really does feel like a nice jungle/industrial vide well. Overall pretty if not exceptional graphics. One note, probably due to budget, not all cutscenees are fully rendered, but instead play out in comic book style action frames. They look good and convey the action well, but would have been so much more epic in real time.\n\n+/- Sound and voice work is mostly competent, if pretty flat. No stadouts here at all. Better maybe than what you'd expect for a $5 game, but nothing more. Explosions and combat sounds are good though. Again, nothing exceptional but fit the game well. Only thing would have made it better is if either Marlow, or the villian, Mr. Long, were better done to fully match the cheesy 80's vibe.\n\n+/- Story is pure 80's cheese and I mean that in the best way possible. Everything is exploding, you are kicking ♥♥♥ and throwing puns, your mask sidekick mocks you when you die, and the bad guy absurdly sets up why everything is basically a deathtrap. This isn't a good story. It's clinche and dumb as hell. But it's fun.\n\n+/- Combat, being the core of the game, is mostly well done. Learning to dodge and block, switching up between your varied attacks, and using combo's is the name of the game. We aren't talking Bayonetta or DMC level of complexity, but it works well. Movements are sometimes a bit sluggesh however, most noticably during some "challeges" where even on missed jump means instant death. Despite those "Challenge" sections, I found the game to be pretty responsive.\n\nIf you are looking for big, brash, stupid, 80's action movie style gameplay that is just fun. Look no further. For $5 bucks or less, you simply can't go wrong. Happily give it a 4/5 due to it just being stupidly fun and a steal when on sale.","January 10, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The voice acting is well done and performed by accomplished voice-actors. The game doesn't take itself seriously and it shows in the funny story. The banter between Marlow and the Mask is great. The Mask cracks jokes when Marlow is killing enemies and makes fun of him when he dies.\n\nI only had one problem, sometimes when trying to grab a rope or ladder you would miss.

Zootfly has managed to clone God of War into a game that is actually better than God of War, with a more interesting (albeit more racist) protagonist in a more creative setting and plot. The gameplay is fantastic, with a character action-based style of liner gameplay, and four very fun movesets based on the weapons you unlock, each with it's own set of satisfying combos. The environments convey an enormous sense of scale, and the camera tricks you into thinking things look much bigger than they are. The environments are very surprisingly gorgeous at times, and the graphics on the PC are surprisingly fantastic. The action is awesome and very over-the-top, with an increase in scale and buildup that rivals that of Platinum's action games, and the fighting levels are broken up by decently lengthy minigames throughout, including an on-rails shooter boss battle and a shoot-em-up helicopter section. Even the end credits are a minigame (which sure beats most credits sequences in terms of enjoyability!). The characters are just developed and fun enough to make a VERY STUPID, yet enjoyable and decently funny story, and the main villain, (also extremely racist) is a very satisfying enemy to face in the final boss battle. At 5 dollars, this is some of the best value you can get form a Steam game purchase, and it's a game that will offer you significant enjoyment no matter who you are. Trust me, this game stands out.

Inspired (very, very heavily.  Like, "watch out for copyright lawsuits" heavily) by God of War 2, a game already known by all men with booming voices, beards, and indescribable road rage, this is the tale of Marlow Briggs.  See, Marlow isn't just your regular old barrel-chested he-man.  He fights fires.  Not to be confused with spraying water on burning buildings, no.  Before you have ever even picked up the controller, Marlow Briggs has had a history of going mano-e-mano with towering pillars of flame.  Fists only.  No items.  Final Destination.  By the time your dainty, effeminate hands have laid themselves down on the controller (play it with a controller, it's a console type of action game), he has had sexual intercourse with more women than you have ever seen, including your mother and all of your sisters over the age of 18, though the underage ones still jill off to him.  Over the course of the next few hours, you will direct his wrath at a menagerie of mercenaries and Aztec horrors all over a Central American jungle.  Even though I was already an adult male, this game put me through a second, much stronger puberty.  My testicles dangle like anvils with a sweater on them, my booming voice shatters windows and sends girly men screaming to the ground, and my muscles got so big that even wearing a muscle shirt still costs the GDP of a small African country.  I have to wear a shirt or else risk being drowned in a tide of slippery sloots.

This is a God of War/DMC cheap clone that at 5 bucks (or less on sale) is a steal. Self aware, absurd, and beyond stupid in the best, over the top, 80's style action possible.\n\n+/- Graphics - for a budget title, graphics are really good. Lip synching isn't the best, bust graphics are bright and fun, matching the over the top atmosphere. Explosions about, and everything just works. Some environments are repetitive, and there could be more enemy variety, but what does exist really does feel like a nice jungle/industrial vide well. Overall pretty if not exceptional graphics. One note, probably due to budget, not all cutscenees are fully rendered, but instead play out in comic book style action frames. They look good and convey the action well, but would have been so much more epic in real time.\n\n+/- Sound and voice work is mostly competent, if pretty flat. No stadouts here at all. Better maybe than what you'd expect for a $5 game, but nothing more. Explosions and combat sounds are good though. Again, nothing exceptional but fit the game well. Only thing would have made it better is if either Marlow, or the villian, Mr. Long, were better done to fully match the cheesy 80's vibe.\n\n+/- Story is pure 80's cheese and I mean that in the best way possible. Everything is exploding, you are kicking ♥♥♥ and throwing puns, your mask sidekick mocks you when you die, and the bad guy absurdly sets up why everything is basically a deathtrap. This isn't a good story. It's clinche and dumb as hell. But it's fun.\n\n+/- Combat, being the core of the game, is mostly well done. Learning to dodge and block, switching up between your varied attacks, and using combo's is the name of the game. We aren't talking Bayonetta or DMC level of complexity, but it works well. Movements are sometimes a bit sluggesh however, most noticably during some "challeges" where even on missed jump means instant death. Despite those "Challenge" sections, I found the game to be pretty responsive.\n\nIf you are looking for big, brash, stupid, 80's action movie style gameplay that is just fun. Look no further. For $5 bucks or less, you simply can't go wrong. Happily give it a 4/5 due to it just being stupidly fun and a steal when on sale.","January 10, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cardinalfang/recommended/249680/","cardinalfang","Dr. McScience","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cardinalfang/","245 products in account","A cheap & cheerful God of War style beat-em-up. Although a budget title, graphically it has a lot of polish with big set pieces, a lot of explosions and decent enough effects. The plot is silly and the game knows it. As Marlow Briggs, you are a huge black dude who gets imbued by superpowers after being stabbed by a mystic, ancient weapon. You are then followed around by a floating tribal mask while you 'save the princess' and the fate of the world. While beating people up is the primary mode of play, you will also shoot down helicopters (multiple times), fly planes (1942-style), platform and puzzle solve. It's mindless fun.\n\nIt's no masterpiece, though. Textures are pretty low resolution, and I encountered at least one showstopping bug during my playthrough. There are some annoyances, like how some ledges you can't fall off of (even though there's nothing blocking you from the edge) and others you can easily walk to your death. There are a few too many 'minecart' sequences (the kind where you are on-rails and have to dodge obstacles) - one of these is on an actual minecart. Most of these are just annoying instead of fun. The game is farily easy, with the exception of the final boss, which took me a few tries to beat. In fact, the hardest part of the game is the end credits (I'll let you figure out what I mean on your own).\n\nAnyway, for the price (dirt cheap on steam sale), it's easy to recommend.","February 22, 2015","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Zootfly has managed to clone God of War into a game that is actually better than God of War, with a more interesting (albeit more racist) protagonist in a more creative setting and plot. The gameplay is fantastic, with a character action-based style of liner gameplay, and four very fun movesets based on the weapons you unlock, each with it's own set of satisfying combos. The environments convey an enormous sense of scale, and the camera tricks you into thinking things look much bigger than they are. The environments are very surprisingly gorgeous at times, and the graphics on the PC are surprisingly fantastic. The action is awesome and very over-the-top, with an increase in scale and buildup that rivals that of Platinum's action games, and the fighting levels are broken up by decently lengthy minigames throughout, including an on-rails shooter boss battle and a shoot-em-up helicopter section. Even the end credits are a minigame (which sure beats most credits sequences in terms of enjoyability!). The characters are just developed and fun enough to make a VERY STUPID, yet enjoyable and decently funny story, and the main villain, (also extremely racist) is a very satisfying enemy to face in the final boss battle. At 5 dollars, this is some of the best value you can get form a Steam game purchase, and it's a game that will offer you significant enjoyment no matter who you are. Trust me, this game stands out. Where did it even come from?\n\nJust buy this game, it's great! Really worth taking a look at!","October 10, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bohlingc/recommended/249680/","bohlingc","Kahless","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bohlingc/","322 products in account","This game is a button masher adolescent power fantasy.\n\nThankfully that's exactly what I wanted. It's a stupid hack-and-slash with no depth that succeeds because it keeps the pace up and constantly changes what you're doing. It has a dumb-as-rocks story that involves Marlow Briggs, a Regular Guy (TM) getting killed by an Evil Genius (TM) and then being resurrected to take on said Evil Genius by Aku Aku from Crash Bandicoot.\n\nFrom there it's 6-8 hours of slashing and platforming and rail shooting. You don't do any one thing for too long so it doesn't get boring.\n\nThe only issue I have with the game is some of the late game boss fights, which fall into the trap of going like this: dodge to avoid boss's slow attack, dodge in and hit boss once or twice, dodge back out, repeat. This would be fine except that many of the bosses have really large health pools, so, while it's not hard to beat them because you can easily avoid their attacks, the battles do test your patience. This is just bad game design. If I've figured out the trick to beating the boss, let me beat the boss already! Don't make me do the trick 40 times, I already understand it!\n\nOther than that it's good if you want something with that dumb 80s action movie feel.\n\nPerformance note: this game has a couple of annoying, but not game-breaking, technical problems.\n\nFirst, my audio drivers crashed every single time I quit the game, resulting in that loud buzzing noise that you get when your drivers crash. I had to restart the computer to get the noise to stop. Not a huge deal since I beat this in 3 sittings, but it is annoying. I have a dedicated Asus Xonar soundcard and I haven't noticed anyone else complaining about this problem, so it might just be my setup. YMMV.\n\nSecond, this game respects the Windows display scaling when it shouldn't. What I mean is, I have my computer hooked up to a 43" TV and I sit about 7 feet away, so I have to set text and apps to 150% size in Windows display settings to make things readable. When I run Marlow Briggs with display scaling set to 150%, the game's menus and HUD increase as well and run off the side of the screen. So I had to toggle my Windows display scaling every time I booted the game up. I haven't noticed any other games that do this, so it makes me think that 505 Games just doesn't know what they're doing.","February 8","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My good friend came up to me and told me "Hey, have you checked out Marlow Briggs for 99¢ on Steam? It's a life-changing game and the best game you will ever play for 99¢ in your life." I thought a great game for only 99¢? That sounds too good to be true, but I still bought it because for 99¢, what did I have to lose? As soon as it finished downloading, my computer played a chorus fit for the Heavens. As the chorus chanted "Marlow Briggs", getting louder and louder as I finally clicked on the game to start it. Once I did that, the chorus stopped immediately as one last "MARLOW BRIGGS" was sung with a ear deafening, yet mentally soothing tone. Following the silence was the game booting up and bringing me to the start screen, I subsequently went blind. My vision was brought back after a few minutes which I can only assume was Marlow Briggs himself testing me to see if I was worthy of laying my eyes upon this immortal beauty. From here I cannot say what beautiful godlike things have happened to me playing this game, as only Marlow Briggs can judge who can have this knowledge, but I can tell you now, I know everything and anything. I no longer have the capacity for depression because I have no need for mortal foolishness like emotions. Only my pure devotion to Marlow Briggs is needed to sustain my now immortal body and mind.

ASTOUNDINGLY LOW THAT IS OOOOOOOOHHHH (see? I can write unfunny jokes, too).\n\nAt first, its actually a fun game: action, 'splosions, dumb one-liners, what more could you want from a game like this? But oh boy does it get old fast. This game really has it all and then doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about any of it: not about its action, not about its characters (which IS important - don't tell me Arnie isn't a cool character in everything he's in), and least of all about its originality.\n\nWhat killed the game for me was not just the immense level of copypasting off of God of War - although it really is so immense that it's not even funny any more: every single game mechanic from fighting to dodging, blocking, running, climbing, chain swinging, block pushing, orb collecting etc. was aped - but the fact that none of it was copied competently. The puzzles are insultingly easy, the stylized cutscenes (that were taken from the first GoW) are painfully slow and boring, the story itself is horrendously dull even for a game like this and the combat just didn't cut it. At one point, I accidently turned off my monitor during a fight and I decided to just humor the game - attempt the combat with the screen off. Yup, killed them all, no ♥♥♥♥♥ given.\n\nThe moment you receive the Chains of Olympus weapon was the moment the developers found even more ♥♥♥♥♥ to not give and did not even try hiding any more how blatantly they copied God of War. Half an hour later I heard the most forced and lamest tentacle porn joke in the history of hentai, and I suppose at that point you can guess what I refused to give.\n\nI feel like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ not recommending this game at this price but I just can't. Only buy this if you are willing to get no more than 30 minutes of fun from this game or you are really capable of ignoring absolutely all of your standards. The game gets cut a lot of slack for being silly (and dirt cheap), but I didn't find it was possible to oversee how few ♥♥♥♥♥ the developers gave about any of this. I was prepared (and hyped!) for a B-game à la God Hand, but there is just no soul in this.

You're never doing the same thing for too long, which keeps the experience fresh and entertaining. As you progress through the game, your weapon acquires different forms (scythe, twin daggers, whip, and hammer), which are useful in different situations and you can switch between them at any time. In addition you also learn some very powerful spells which are good at clearing out large crowds of enemies.\n\nOverall the difficulty I felt was balanced perfectly. There were no unexpected difficulty spikes and most of it was a smooth ride. In the last quarter of the game it gets a bit challenging, but it does so gradually and reasonably.","December 30, 2015","true","2.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

He has also done a insane amount of other movies and voice-overs, including work in Diablo 3.\n\nThe game loads up and just starts right away. No menu, nothing, just begins with the opening sequence. But it is automatically set at my resolution and refresh rate with vsync on which blows my mind that this obscure game can do that and hardly any other game can. I ALWAYS have to check res and vsync first thing in any game I ever start up for the first time. So hats off to this game for that, golf clap.\n\nThis first thing you will immediately notice within the first ten seconds is that your guy has a serious medical condition: his veins in his arms bulge out so much that they exist completely on the outside of his arms. No doubt they were trying to make him look ripped and badass but no man I have ever seen has veins that bulge to a point of being external. Hopefully I come across a medical clinic soon in the game to have that fixed or pick up a health pack or something.\n\nBy far the best deal and fun-to-dollar ratio of any game I have ever bought on steam. It was only 99 cents and it is a very good AAA game that was overlooked when it was released. It is a rail action game, meaning you do not control the camera, it just moves with you as you go along in the game. It actually works fine too this way. It's the same rail action as a game like Narco Terror. The gameplay is solid and flows nicely, and is much akin to the God of War games. The graphics are great, the entire game looks very good. Very vibrant with awesome effects. The story is instantly forgettable. If I want a good story I will play a RPG or read a book. The last place I would ever look for a good story is a action game, and there are very few exceptions.\n\nIt is really amazing that I found this gem on sale for only a dollar. If you are an action game fan there is no reason you should not like this unless you are ignorant. Since most players on steam play garbage like DayZ, then you probably already are dumb beyond words. It really is a pretty fun and well done solid game. 8/10","July 2, 2014","true","2.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Even some of the canned wisecracks were sort of funny.\nAbout two thirds of the way in, however, the difficulty spikes and the fights become a real chore - you're constantly dodging out of the way and never get to use any of the neat combos the game has spent the past few hours teaching you. Some of the jumping sections are also pretty obnoxious, with checkpoints set way too far back. The camera is not manually controllable, and whilst it usually does a decent job of being in the right place can be annoying when you just want to look around and work out a puzzle or plan a jump. There is a manual save function which can mitigate some of the frustration if you notice and remember to use it.\n\nWhilst the game certainly has its good points - the art is pretty cool, and the fights are fun at first - I found it too frustrating and with too many cheap-feeling deaths to get a recommendation. If you have a slightly masochistic streak and don't mind trying the same jump over and over, maybe this would suit you.","May 11, 2014","false","11.1"," 21 of 41 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","21","41","0","0"

You have light and heavy attacks creating different combinations, blocks to reflect enemy projectiles, dodging, and magic.\n\n+4 different weapons and magic to fit your play style\n\n+ Throughout the game you will visit interesting locations each providing its own unique action set pieces. The game does a good job of varying up the gameplay to a certain degree to keep things interesting.\n\n+easy achievements\n\n+The game is short but I consider that pretty good for this game because it doesn't wear out its welcome, it does everything it sets out to do.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The game itself is very competently made, however its biggest "flaw" is that it is very unoriginal. God of War came out before this game and does just about everything better in every category. This is the biggest clone of God of War I have ever seen, from the combat to the platforming to the moves. This in itself isn't bad as many games copy each other however this game brings absolutely nothing new to the table. I know you should judge a game on its own merits but its highly obvious the developers looked at God of War and re-skinned it.\n\n- The story is an afterthought and serves as an excuse for you to kill lots and lots of enemies. After the first 5 minutes of the game the entire story is laid out before you. It doesn't help that the dialogue is terrible.\n\n- Every character in the game is generic, its hard to care about anyone in the game\n\n- Outside of combat the platforming and controls can be a bit flaky at times.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you are looking for a fun mindless action game, then look no further, given the price of the game this is probably one of the better values you will find. If you enjoyed God of War then you should check this game out as its the closest thing you're going to play on steam.\n","October 17, 2014","true","12.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Enemies are varied as are locations. Boss battles are quite lame, but brief.\n\nThe game makes no premises about what it is and is filled with self-parody and stupidity all the way through it's "story". Cutscenes and characters are laughably plastic and the game even has an achievement for skipping all cutscenes, which I thoroughly recommend on "achieving". 5-6 hours of fun and enjoyable combat and great colourful levels, supplemented by dumb and hilarious commentary of a talking Mayan mask are definitely worth this game's asking price.\n\n"If only there was a conveniently-placed AA gun for me to deal with all these helicopters..."","July 14, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Great intro vid and nice characters and awesome visuals with gameplay mechanics similar to most button smashers however the game has it's flaw it's way too much like a much simpler version of uncharted, darksiders and the typical button smasher. The story is average and the only people who would like this game are people that like comics, comic book films/games, button smashing with no actual purpose, casual gaming and quick short games with not a lot of things to offer. So in a critcal scale I'd give it a 6/10 while personally I would give it a 5.5/10 as it's got great potential if they make more sequels and put more tasks into the games etc. Marlow Briggs isn't the problem, the problem is the gameplay itself.","January 26, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

It's a pretty standard formula of action adventure games akin to the likes of Darksiders, God of War, and Devil May Cry, and it might do everything that's been done before, but it does so very well and manages to stay fun throughout.\n\nThe gameplay is nicely balanced between combat sections, platforming, puzzles, and mini-games. You're never doing the same thing for too long, which keeps the experience fresh and entertaining. As you progress through the game, your weapon acquires different forms (scythe, twin daggers, whip, and hammer), which are useful in different situations and you can switch between them at any time. In addition you also learn some very powerful spells which are good at clearing out large crowds of enemies.\n\nOverall the difficulty I felt was balanced perfectly. There were no unexpected difficulty spikes and most of it was a smooth ride. In the last quarter of the game it gets a bit challenging, but it does so gradually and reasonably. Only one section involving a certain collapsing underground bridge felt a bit cheap since it gave me a lot of insta-deaths, but that section was pretty short.\n\nI really enjoyed most of the mini-games, such as the first-person shooting sections where you have to mount a turret and shoot down helicopters, or even flying one yourself, or sliding down the cliffs and dodging obstacles. No overcomplicated mechanics. Just simple and fun mini-games to give you a small break from fighting and platforming.\n\nThe plot is somewhat cheesy and lighthearted, but the main character is quite likeable, and his frequent dialogue exchanges with his sidekick, the Mask of Death, are all very funny. The length was also quite spot on for a game like this. Took me about 10 hours to beat it on Normal.\n\nMy only serious critique for this game would be the occasional crashes to desktop that I got (and it seems there are some other people who get them too). It wasn't too bad, since the game has very frequent checkpoints, so you don't lose a lot of progress, but it's still a bug.\n\nI'd say if you enjoy action adventure games and seek something to give you heaps of entertainment, then I'd highly recommend this game. I got it for merely £4 (~$6), which is its full price on Steam and enjoyed it way more than some games which I bought for a higher price.","August 23, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You're constantly slashing your way through the same bad guys and being bombarded with explosions which is fun for about an hour but then just grates on you. The platforming is very basic and the camera doesn't do you any favours when you're trying to jump across gaps which gets frustrating. Overall I just couldn't get anywhere near finishing it as there's undoubtedly far better games out there to be played.","January 30","false","1.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But Marlow Briggs lacks both charm and quality to make it appealing. Few would argue that the pricing is reasonable. However, the game suffers from too many issues to make it a recommendable game. The game consists of platforming sections and "hack n slash" combat. The problem is not the variety in combos, weapons, enemies and level design. I'd go as far as saying the developers have done a decent job (for a low-budget game anyway) in those departments. The problem is simple: PLATFORMING SECTIONS. This is a game where you don't have control over the camera so it's EXTREMELY linear - as in, you can't deviate. One would think that there is little to go wrong but you'd be wrong. You will die hundreds of times not because of poor timing or misjudgement, but because the game is simply glitchy. Inputs are not handled with any care whatsoever - the game doesn't feel consistent or smooth to play at all. Everything has a delay, and sections involving grappling or swinging are very buggy - often you can't jump off the rope, for example. Although the game is light-hearted and makes jokes about its own design, there's nothing original whatsoever. It's not classy, intelligent or well-thought out by any means. The story and characters are generic, and the level of comedy is not enough to make you laugh out loud. The problem becomes apparent when you realise that the game is TRYING to be "epic" with all its fancy locations and scenery, yet the texture quality is bad with lots of pop-in. Whilst I highly value big-budget AAA titles, I also have an appreciation for the underdogs and smaller games which sacrifice production value for a single aspect - like comedic writing/characters or focus on one specific gameplay mechanic. Unfortunately, Marlow Briggs does not impress in any department. If you are bored and have nothing better to do and are desperate for a cheap giggle, Marlow Briggs can provide that. Just don't expect it to be anything memorable.","January 29, 2015","false","3.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The hero, unsurprisingly named Marlow, is portrayed by Arif Kinchen (aka Pierce from Saints Row), you've also got James Hong (Mr. Ping from Kung Fu Panda), and Steve Blum (Tom from Toonami, and pretty much everything else in existence with a voice actor). The bantor and the comedy is there, even though the game "acts" like it takes itself seriously, more on that in a bit...\n\nI've never played a God of War game, but having seen some gameplay videos from that landmark franchise I can see where the parallels are drawn from.  I played most of my playthrough with a Steam Controller using the default gamepad template Steam offers for all titles and it felt very natural.  I couldn't comment on the keyboard/mouse input as I have yet to give it a chance, but I also played the intro with a 360 controller just fine, so if you have a gamepad laying around you should give it a shot on this title as it has console roots, both mechanic and development wise.\n\nSpeaking of development, where in xibalba did this game even come from?  I remember the tweet for the release going live on the official Steam accounts, but prior to that ZootFly was never on my radar.  Even looking into their catalog, Marlow Briggs seems like a diamond in the rough.  The game launched on PC and Xbox 360 as an Arcade title, but sports graphics that would be at home on most AAA console titles from the 360/PS3 era.  There is a decent variety of enemies, with new variations and additions being thrown at you right until the end.  The settings alternate between Mesoamerican ruins that leave you wondering "how the heck did they build something so ginormous?", and humongous industrial complexes/machines that leave you wondering "why the heck did they build something so ginormous?".  The weapons and powers follow an experience based upgrade system, but the game is plenty generous with xp pickups and you usually end up maxing out your new unlocks not too long after receiving them.\n\nThe plot, and even in some portions the animation and voice acting can be received in two different ways-\n1. So cheesey and jenky that it circles around to become awesome again.\n2. Purposefully made super duper cheesey and jenky, which means it was done with just as much heart, so also making it awesome.\n\nI mean, there are scenes where your goal is to "shoot down all the helicpoters" and the game proceeds to throw nearly a 100 choppers at you.  Who has that many choppers on standby?  Who is that 100th chopper that sees the first 99 explode in front of him that says "Ef it, yolo" and continues to come at you guns blazing?  Also there's a scene where you fly a generic prop plane like Xevious and it somehow has the payload capacity for a bunch of heat seeking rockets AND machine guns under the propeller. I know, I know: What. Even.\n\nEither way, I'm not quite sure Zootfly knows what they've got with this franchise but the cliffhangerish ending demands a sequel with just as much over the top action, explosions, and lulzy dialog.","November 26, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But don't judge so quickly it might have a linear storyline yet you encounter and experience the wildest things from hanging upside down on a helicopter to fighter a huge fish God. All while you try to save the "Princess" with your mask companion, who will bring all mental encouragement you need.\nWarning though some people might not enjoy the dialog, which is filled with cheesy comments, but also with funny comments of the ancient mask, who will tell you all about the Aztec culture and just generally comment in a funny way on what happening.\nLike I said earlier gameplay is fairly simple and you unlock 4 different weapons and 4 different spells plus a ranged attack as you progress. You also have a lot of time the possibility to mash the "E" button or the "B" button, if playing on a controller, which I found to be superior to the keyboard controls, but none the less you can play with keyboard, you'll be at a slight disadvantage against later enemies though. To no surprise, enemy variety is not that high, up until the last third of the game, where you encounter most of the bosses and harder enemies.\n\nOverall a very cheap and cheesy, but very fun game, if you enjoy over the top stupid games.

Sure it copies a decent amount of its tricks from the God of War formula, but in all honestly, that's not really a bad template to borrow from.  Throw in a little bit of Indiana Jones, 70s blaxploitation film-making, B action movies, nonsensical comedy and you've got the vibe for this game down pat.  I actually enjoyed this game more than alot of big budget games from the same genre.\n\nBriggs isn't a perfect game, yet it does so much right that I couldn't stop playing until I completed the hardcore mode today, FINALLY.  In Marlow Briggs you are killed by an evil Chinese magnate who wants to rule the world with a frightening, sort of terraforming magical power.  He kills you and kidnaps your girlfriend, though thankfully Marlow is brought back by a wise-cracking mask that guides him through his journey to save the girl, the day and the world.  The entire premise is ridiculous.  Once you're having fun with the game, the plot hardly even matters.\n\nAt its core, Briggs is a hack n' slashers delight.  You arm yourself with several types of melee weapons, magic, long range attacks and acrobatic abilities.  As you fight and explore, you earn experience to upgrade your powers, making you a killing machine on a machine.  You'll explore crazy industrial complexes, temples, caves, jungles and much more.  While graphically, Marlow and the gang aren't the best game in town; he surely isn't the worst looking either.  Levels are solidly detailed with lots to peer at in the distance and the enviroments look good while alternately being a blast to travel.  There's hidden secrets to find and numerous achievements to unlock.  There is also a hardcore mode on hand that will test your skills for certain.  It's not as impossible as Deadlight, but it will put up a stiff challenge and make you sing for your supper.\n\nYou upgrade with new equipment at key points of the game while fighting legions of foes that include all sorts of armed guards, giant insects, mythical looking boss creatures, teleporting evil priests, giants, a wolf like Hellbeast and other assorted demons.  The boss fights are a blast, and require quicks hands, strategic use of attacks/abilities and old fashioned pattern memorization.  That's really all there is to it!  The campagin is a decent length with alot of areas to explore and frequent differences in scenery so that you'll rarely be bored and when you're not fighting like a champ there are all sorts of gameplay variations to keep things exciting.  You'll man gun turrets, fly choppers and fighter planes while shooting down everything in sight, use your nimble abilities to platform your way to victory, etc.  The controls were mostly tight and responsive, so it's easy to get yourself in the action and stay there.  While I expected minimal of this game, I got way more than I bargained for and put in 28.7 hrs to beat it twice and get most of the achievements (97%).   Hell, once weakening certain monsters like the club wielding giants and monster scorpions, you can even ride and use them to fight Golden Axe style!\n\nOn the downside, sometimes the controls do tend to get a little wacky and combo stringing won't feel entirely accurate, making for a cheap death or two.  The QT buttom presses to hammer down on certain bosses and deal decisive blows don't always register, which also got me slaughtered a couple of times as well.  While not with the frequency of a survival horror game, the camera has potential to get a little rickety and you'll end up taking a beating from some foes you can't even see.  All of the problems with the game were rather minor and I actually thought this game was HIGHLY addicting and entertaining to play.  To be honest...I like it more than some of the God of War sequels.  You can scream blasphemy all you want, but that's how I felt.  Another downside is that the slow-motion cut scenes could have been better executed and the voice acting isn't top-notch (although its rampant cheesiness is rather endearing as this game is straight out of one of those B movie action 4 packs).  Overall, anyone into the hack n' slash genre would do well to check this out for the cheap price.  I hope they make a sequel with co-op!  Good lord, that'd be a blast.\n\nNow for some quick pros and cons:\n\nPros\n\n-Solid graphics and sound\n-Excellent set of weapons, abilities and magic\n-90% of the time the fighting is fluid and fun\n-Superb enemy variety with tough fights and killer battles with monstrous bosses\n-Campy storyline and voice-acting adds to the appeal\n-Combos are easy to execute and satisfying\n- 90% of the time the controls are response and fun\n-Great gameplay variety with everything listed above and even a few puzzles\n\nCons\n\n-10% of the time the fighting can be a little clunky\n-10% of the time some button presses won't register, especially the QT sequences (fortunately they are few)\n-Platforming is a beotch when the controls stutter\n\nOverall:  8.2/10","October 17, 2015","true","28.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Late-game platforming becomes impossible to judge without at least one or two pointless deaths due to preset perspectives. In general, the camera is not your friend, and you have no control over it. The fun combat devolves into slug fests agianst enemies and bosses with increasingly lengthy health bars.\n\nI couldn't imagine throwing out combos with a keyboard, but your welcome to try. You will need near-perfect control of late game combos, and you will need combos to make any impact on late-game enemy mobs and bosses.\n\nI recommend this game because the beginning is fun. The cheese-yness of the story and bad guy got old fast, and I really got sick of my companion mocking me for my failures. However, the combat is impactful and robust, even if the overall gameplay is nowhere near tight enough for what the game sometimes demands. The entire experience can be brute-forced, if necessary. Get this if you can on sale. Otherwise, go buy something else.\nGameplay:\nhttp://youtu.be/MV4G7SOOZDE","July 14, 2014","true","5.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

During my playthrough I ran into multiple camera issues (camera flew out of the level and I got treated to the low-res backgrounds until I restarted the checkpoint, among others). The platforming is okay, but there are a few times where it's difficult to tell where you're supposed to go. Likewise, I ran into a few sections where the camera moves while you're supposed to be moving and it threw off the jump, leading me to more than one unfortunate and frustrating death.\n\nThat being said, the game has pretty decent humor and it knows its place in the game pantheon. It doesn't try to do anything special, and there are the same basic weapon and magic sets you should expect to find in a game of this type.\n\nOverall, it's a decent game. With a short playthrough (roughly 6 hours on normal) and some aggravating camera issues, I don't know that I would recommend it at full price. If you're looking for a cheap, quick hack & slash game with decent humor and a nice, new setting then I'd recommend picking it up.","September 25, 2014","true","7.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Of particular note is its inclusion of Steve Blum as the Mask Guardian and James Hong as the villain, combat that evokes happy memories of God of War, and a big-dumb-action-movie approach with many, many explosions (in the industrial environments, at any rate).

I think they wanted to make a franchise out of this, what with the character's name on the damn title. Too bad it's all mediocre.\n\nThe combat is of the button mashing variety. There are plenty of combos that take the form of a light and heavy attack, with combinations being strung together. The problem with that sort of combo system is that you can't expect me to remember all the 'XXXY, XXXX, XYXX, YXXY' combos. It winds up just being a button masher with a combo system that has too much to memorize for it's own good. You wind up memorizing three or so moves and just constantly mash those out.\n\nIt's boring as hell. Simplicity isn't bad, route memorization is. Metal Gear Rising had a similar set-up, but the memorization was kept to a minimum. The fun in combat lied in keeping your blue gauge up and getting those quick kills. The Arkham titles have an even simpler battle system, with the challenge being in continuing your chain of attack while thwarting enemies with properly placed counters. Marlow Briggs presents nothing unique or interesting in its combat. It's just randomly hitting buttons with the challenge lying in simply keeping your health gauge up. There's nothing rewarding in the combat itself.\n\nApart from the mediocre combat, the game has light platforming and puzzle elements. When you aren't busy fighting, you'll be traversing the level with fixed camera angles. The platforming is all pretty barebones and boils down to jumping across pits and pressing the action button when appropriate. Swinging from cliffs and walking across ledges would be a lot more exciting if there was any sort of challenge to it beyond pressing a button. The fact that the camera angles are fixed means that there's not even any challenge in finding how to proceed. It's all meant to look nice and tantamount to simply pressing right on the joystick while ocassionally hitting the B button to jump across the ocassional pit. Again, it's boring.\n\nOn the positive side of things, the game looks gorgeous for a budget title. I got it for 99 cents a few sales ago, and can't comprehend how such a cheap ♥♥♥ title can look so damn good. There's even some creativity in the way some of the cutscenes unfold.\n\nOtherwise, it's all mediocre and completely forgettable. For a budget title it passes the time and is...not completely offensive, but if that's its only real upside then it really has nothing going for it.\n\nRecommended if you are, plan to be, or ever will be Tyler Perry","January 6, 2015","false","10.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

A game can be very intriguing, but not necessarily fun, and I can enjoy it immensely --take puzzle games, for instance, or Phoenix Wright. Vice versa, you have games like Team Fortress 2, where there's not much intrigue in story or setting but a ton of carnal fun. Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death lacks any 'umph' in either of those two elements.\n\nSure, the game can be occasionally fun. The game play is very Devil May Cry styled, quick, fierce, and sharp. The magic you get in the game, though limited, is quite satisfying, and the landscapes are generally pretty. Too often though did I find myself bored when I was chugging through the fighting segments, or struggling through some of the game's numerous mini-games. That's almost a kiss of death for a game centered around combat and platforming.\n\nOn the flip side, the game is only sort of intriguing. MBMD is just brimming with explosions, and it's sprinkled with a B-movie style humor that's actually quite charming. Only thing is, it loses its charm fast. Flat characters and a bland, almost predictable story keep this game from being interesting for me, and the flat voice acting and bland animation from everyone else beside the main characters just feels stale.\n\nSo for the most part, I really don't recommend this game. It's far from bad, but there's so much else out there that is worth playing more, unless you're really hungry for another platformer.","December 24, 2014","false","12.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

This is a $5 game and a pretty solid example of getting what you pay for.\n\nThe gameplay is decent, pretty good actually, but the story is slow and the platforming sections often feature really frustrating and stupid pixel-perfect jumps. Graphics are... decent.\n\nThe combat is pretty solid though, with a variety of weapons and spells. Unfortunately you might have a hard time executing your combos when your framerate suddenly drops into the single digits for no identifiable reason. On top of that, the controls are pretty... weird. with dual mapping between mouse buttons and i, o and p, for one example. This leads to some confusion when QTEs reference one set of these controls when you're using the other. On top of that, the game refuses to accept any controller that isn't an XBox 360 controller, so if you have a logitech gamepad or something else, sorry, but you're screwed. Lern2Joy2Key.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this to someone who likes this kind of game, if not for the porting issues and DRM. The DRM is of the "♥♥♥♥ your progress the connection dropped so I'm kicking you back to main menu" variety. If you don't have a stable internet connection, I would strongly advise you stay far away from this game entirely.","October 18, 2014","false","1.0"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","0"

It would have been nice if the developers made the collision detection (especially during puzzles) as sloppy as the controls so this steaming pile of a game wasn't nothing but frustration as the gamer strives to manuveur sloppy controls into pin-point-specific collision points.   Pure grey-hair-producing frustration forced me to finish this game (in under 6 hours).  I do not recommend this to anyone regardless of other gamers' reviews.  A complete waste of time and money even at $2.24!  A better investment would be to hunt down a used PS3 just for God of War.","April 15, 2014","false","6.4"," 4 of 24 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","4","24","0","0"

It's a spectacle fighter with fairly decent gameplay, very good for the price point, I'd say.  Think God of War centered around Rambo's black cousin.\n\nA lot of the attacks don't really feel like they have a lot of weight to them, especially with the Whip, because the enemies don't really react like they were hit or get staggered in any way. The attacks certainly at least look pretty though, and some combos feel very satisfying. Generally the combat system is fairly fleshed out imo. There are a lot of combos and each of the four weapon types has their own combo system.\n\nMy biggest problems with the game are the camera and the fairly frequent crashes. Unless I missed something you have no control of the camera at all. It generally gets the job done but often picks some angles that wouldnt exactly have been my first choice, and sometimes gets kinda awkward. And the game definitely has some stability issues. I don't know if it just hates my machine, but I'd say I crash probably once per 20-30 mins. The games usually fun enough for me to relaunch it and keep going though. But I do strongly advise you to make frequent saves. The checkpoint system is generally alright but doesn't to add more buffers in case you crash (or fall into a pit in a platforming section).\n\nOther less major complaints would include a few turret sections that I didn't love but at least they weren't THAT long or overly frequent (think i've had 3 in a couple hours of gameplay), a few kinda annoying QTEs but again not that many or very long. I could have also lived without the audio-clips from Marlow's girlfriend but I think they can be skipped if they bug you enough.\n\nThe game does have some puzzle and platforming elements that you may or may not enjoy. Persnally I thought the platforming was just challenging enough to not be boring but it didn't get frustrating or overstay its welcome. If nothing else the companion makes a few funny remarks when/if you fail. The puzzles so far have generally been pretty simplistic and I could live without them but can also live with them.\n\nGenerally I'd say I've had a pretty good time with the game, and the positives have outweighed the few problems I've had with the game. The gameplay is pretty enjoyable and I personally rather like the humor with the banter from the companion, the villain, and the occasional 4th wall breaks. Got it on sale for like $1 and I definitely got my money's worth.. and then some.","December 15, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/refresz/recommended/249680/","refresz","ref","http://steamcommunity.com/id/refresz/","503 products in account","Decided to write a small opinion about the game since almost no-one from my friendlist have it in their library.\n\ntl;dr: I liked it. Really funny spectacle fighter/brawler game.\n\nMore:\nIt's a your-standard-generic-brawler game, like any DmC or Batman games this days, yet it offers a nice original story to it placed in Mayan ruins (or Aztecs, or Toltecs, or w/e ;)). There are small glitches here and there, the combat system is not as refined as in DmC, but it was a pleasure playing it.\n\nYou are a man who visits your Ancient South America (later referred to as ASA) linguist girlfriend and suddenly you are killed because reasons (not only monsters, but people as well don't like you in this game). However, the weapon you were killed with was possessed by some god of ASA and he recognizes you as The Spirit Warrior who will bring peace to this part of Earth. And so you get resurrected and have a scythe to get through hoardes of mercenaries, possessed mercenaries, ASA warriors and other monsters and gods from ASA believes.\n\nDuring your progress you get more weapons (in total: scythe, rouge-like weapon - my fav, whip with a blade and warhammer with one side bladed) as well as learn some magic by defeating gods (fire, earth, ice and wind). Spells are summoned by using mana.\n\nYou replenish you health by collecting red orbs/masks and mana by collecting blue ones. Your abilities can by upgraded by collecting enough of yellow ones. However the upgrades are simple: each weapon and spell has three levels, and with each level you get more dmg with it, unlock 2 new moves and your health or mana base value gets higher. It's much simpler than in e.g. Darksiders: there you needed to think what to put your exp into, but here, as the weapons and spells are added to your arsenal in balanced manner, almost always you'd get one thing upgraded before having the other one obtained. With that in mind, the fight system is extremely expanded and the actions you get through sometimes are the typical Hollywood star Bruce Willis level of awesomeness actions.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with the game was the mana system. When you are fully upgraded you get to fire exactly 2 spells. But the mana bar doesn't indicate you in any way if you have enough mana to cast the spell, so you mash the buttons once or twice trying to see if it can work. As stated previously, mana is obtainable in form of blue masks (placed directly on map) or blue orbs (flying out of defeated opponent). As fights are mostly in closed area arenas with god-knows-how-much-opponents going to jump at you in next wave (if there will be any, who knows), you try to limit the usage of blue masks nearby. After you die two or three times to some bigger tank monsters and even start using the masks because why the hell not, you find yourself in a place where you need a smallest amount of mana to use the spell one more time, but it doesn't regenerate in time, and isn't replenished with inflicted damage, so you spend time and time until you finish the monster, and voila, blue f-ing orbs which you don't need anymore. And before next fight it is certain that more than one blue mask will appear.\n\nAnother problem I had were some mini-missions/challenges where you would slide down and had to avoid rocks, pits etc. Alice: Nightmare Returns had some similar sequences, but in here the time between when you push the jump button and when it is registered by the character in game was many times too big for me and I've spent countless times on some of those agility jobs.\n\nAnd one smallest issue: the game needs some power to run smoothly.

I know that Unreal Engine which DmC was running on was tended professionally through years, and I have no idea what was Marlow Briggs build on, but I would expect a little more from the game fidelity.\n\nExcept of those two and a half points above the game was really nice: the story was addictive, the fight system, combos included, was sensationally developed and fluent, graphics caught your eyes and had some great sceneries and the music was always on spot. Also, your mask-god companion has a great sense of sarcastic humour and the voice acting for it is great, so you don't get bored.\n\nHaving in mind that it is actually a budget game (€5 without a sale) this is probably one of the best fun to price factor games you can get right now.\n\nI do recommend this totally underestimated game, give it some love, ref!","November 16, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it is nothing more than a God of War clone, it also starts off more exciting than any God of War, well paced and exciting. The problem is in the fact that the game falls apart toward the end, falling into the typical pitfalls of the character action genre, where you spend more time fighting sponges that prolong the game than feeling like you're actually accomplishing something. The first half is where the game is exceptionally entertaining but beyond that, be prepared for monotany.\n\nThat said, for a cheap-♥♥♥ game like this, it sure has great value. Good graphics, sound, and gameplay. The story is weird and silly and the cutscenes seem to come out of nowhere sometimes, but that's part of the cheap-o charm. The game itself, as I said, is a God of War ripoff unabashedly. Which means it has the problems of God of War. Some weapons are completely useless, and the stupid enemies that go underground and burrow up elsewhere are here as well. When emulating or copy and pasting a game, at least leave the bad portions out.\n\nThis is a short, fun, and cheap game that will appeal to character action fans. I won't give it a wholehearted thumbs up, but I do think it is worth your attention.","August 25, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cutscenes are kept to frozen key frames, but those frames are gorgeous. The characters are simple, but fantastically acted. Combat's just God of War, but it's God of War done very right.\n\nIssues include some minor control issues during platforming and some awkward camera angles, but these are the rough edges of an uncut diamond.

Good thing that's done."\n\nInitial impressions with the game were great. A funny villain, a funny supporting character, over the top action, and not taking the game too seriously. That comes crashing down after you start going to arena after arena fighting some enemies and boss (repeat). Its a spectacle fighter that fouces WAY too much on combat and times where you are doing physics puzzle and just walking around. It needed to keep the action up instead of padding out the game length.\n\nThe game is a spectacle fighter and has a VERY good combat system that a player who actually cares about will love because there are a lot of weapons, magic, and combos to perform. But I mostly just stuck to repeating my heavy attack for the last half of the game and was fine. Initially, the game is easy because the enemies are just dudes. Then you move on to the spiders and scorpians which are ridicusly frustrating because your light attack doesnt regiester. The enemies only react to your heavy and if you have more than two spiders/armored units, good luck putting a heavy without having to stop your combo half way through to roll out of the way. Some of the enemies have a ridiclous amount of helth and they JUST WONT DIE. They pile them onto you and its frurstating at times.\n\nA really weird thing is that there is no mouse control. You cant look around. each section has a fixed camera that moves to highlight the path you go towards. Its weird because it suggests you use only a keyboard. Speaking of which, you will hate platforming when you cant move the camera to see when then next platform is coming and when you cant move accurately with your keyboard. Use a controller if you have one.\n\nHD4000 users: the game runs about 20-25 FPS, has no video menues, and overheated my system causing the game to crash ~10 times.\n\nThe game had potential. The first chapter was funny and then it just took it self to seriously. The notes your girlfriend leaves you are serious and the vilian becomes super serious. It doesn't keep up the action or the humour.\n\nIf you're looking to waste 8ish hours, buy it for a dollar but it seemed like a grind to me.","December 30, 2014","false","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/refresz/recommended/249680/","refresz","ref","http://steamcommunity.com/id/refresz/","503 products in account","Decided to write a small opinion about the game since almost no-one from my friendlist have it in their library.\n\ntl;dr: I liked it. Really funny spectacle fighter/brawler game.\n\nMore:\nIt's a your-standard-generic-brawler game, like any DmC or Batman games this days, yet it offers a nice original story to it placed in Mayan ruins (or Aztecs, or Toltecs, or w/e ;)). There are small glitches here and there, the combat system is not as refined as in DmC, but it was a pleasure playing it.\n\nYou are a man who visits your Ancient South America (later referred to as ASA) linguist girlfriend and suddenly you are killed because reasons (not only monsters, but people as well don't like you in this game). However, the weapon you were killed with was possessed by some god of ASA and he recognizes you as The Spirit Warrior who will bring peace to this part of Earth. And so you get resurrected and have a scythe to get through hoardes of mercenaries, possessed mercenaries, ASA warriors and other monsters and gods from ASA believes.\n\nDuring your progress you get more weapons (in total: scythe, rouge-like weapon - my fav, whip with a blade and warhammer with one side bladed) as well as learn some magic by defeating gods (fire, earth, ice and wind). Spells are summoned by using mana.\n\nYou replenish you health by collecting red orbs/masks and mana by collecting blue ones. Your abilities can by upgraded by collecting enough of yellow ones. However the upgrades are simple: each weapon and spell has three levels, and with each level you get more dmg with it, unlock 2 new moves and your health or mana base value gets higher. It's much simpler than in e.g. Darksiders: there you needed to think what to put your exp into, but here, as the weapons and spells are added to your arsenal in balanced manner, almost always you'd get one thing upgraded before having the other one obtained. With that in mind, the fight system is extremely expanded and the actions you get through sometimes are the typical Hollywood star Bruce Willis level of awesomeness actions.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with the game was the mana system. When you are fully upgraded you get to fire exactly 2 spells. But the mana bar doesn't indicate you in any way if you have enough mana to cast the spell, so you mash the buttons once or twice trying to see if it can work. As stated previously, mana is obtainable in form of blue masks (placed directly on map) or blue orbs (flying out of defeated opponent). As fights are mostly in closed area arenas with god-knows-how-much-opponents going to jump at you in next wave (if there will be any, who knows), you try to limit the usage of blue masks nearby. After you die two or three times to some bigger tank monsters and even start using the masks because why the hell not, you find yourself in a place where you need a smallest amount of mana to use the spell one more time, but it doesn't regenerate in time, and isn't replenished with inflicted damage, so you spend time and time until you finish the monster, and voila, blue f-ing orbs which you don't need anymore. And before next fight it is certain that more than one blue mask will appear.\n\nAnother problem I had were some mini-missions/challenges where you would slide down and had to avoid rocks, pits etc. Alice: Nightmare Returns had some similar sequences, but in here the time between when you push the jump button and when it is registered by the character in game was many times too big for me and I've spent countless times on some of those agility jobs.\n\nAnd one smallest issue: the game needs some power to run smoothly. On my machine DmC was running 60fps on 1080p max settings while this one had to be changed to 720p and some of the graphic options needed to be disabled. I know that Unreal Engine which DmC was running on was tended professionally through years, and I have no idea what was Marlow Briggs build on, but I would expect a little more from the game fidelity.\n\nExcept of those two and a half points above the game was really nice: the story was addictive, the fight system, combos included, was sensationally developed and fluent, graphics caught your eyes and had some great sceneries and the music was always on spot. Also, your mask-god companion has a great sense of sarcastic humour and the voice acting for it is great, so you don't get bored.\n\nHaving in mind that it is actually a budget game (€5 without a sale) this is probably one of the best fun to price factor games you can get right now.\n\nI do recommend this totally underestimated game, give it some love, ref!","November 16, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not the most in-depth hack and slash game, but it's good enough to enjoy it. There's a lot of absurd action and the soundtrack is great (most of the time is the same track, but it's good enough not to get bored of it).\n\nThe combat system is like Bayonetta but slower and not elegant. You press strong or fast attack and depending of the succesion, you make different combos. You have some AoE power but I ended using always the same one.\n\nThe enemy variety is pretty good. At first the enemies are humans (with a lot of variety), later on you encounter gigant insects and then you find some mayan warriors.\n\nThe game is very cheap, even more on sale, so I suggest to buy and play it.

The content ripped from War Smasher 500,000 K really gives it a feeling of depth-perception for your selection of masks. Each mask gives you a different perk, but the ultimate goal is to combine all the masks into a giant f.u.kkerzorg hermaphrodite (Here's a little screenshot of what it looks like)\n\nhttp://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/116327/2382517-2012_12_02_00005.jpg\n\nOverall, I think Toon Crisis 2 is the best 2D Goat Simulator Knock-off I've ever played.

It's a budget title from ZootFly, famous for their Ghostbusters demo they released a few years before the actual game from Atari.  On paper, its a generic action game. You play Marlow Briggs, you work on a rig?..., bad guys come after you, you get infused with the power of the jungle, now you can fight the bad guys.\n\nBut Marlow Briggs, to experience Marlow Briggs, is entirely different thing all together.\n\nImagine, almost to a fault, a Sony all-stars mashup. Imagine the world of Nathan Drake's Uncharted, invaded by a mildly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off Kratos, who is guided along his journey by the “Aku-Aku” mask from Crash Bandicoot, roll them together like a Katamari Damacy ball and you have Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death.\n\nThis game, is for lack of a better definition a B-Game. It's story doesn't rival any of the before mentioned games, and it isn't trying to. Marlow is a clever mix, cherry picked from the finest parts of other games, and created it's own awe inspiring game.  It's fun, the action is constant and enjoyable. The story is simple, but the characters are interesting. Marlow is a tough, but soft hero, imagine a Keith David meets Sidney Poitier. He's a character who can be kind, but shake some sass if he has to. He's followed by the Mask of Death, who like the Aku-Aku mask follows the player around, providing the comic relief and instructional help.\n\nThe action is non stop. It just keeps blasting right around you. The gameplay is almost exactly like God of War or DMC, hack and slash, mowing down enemys left and right.\n\nFor $5.00, or if you've purchased it during the summer sale for $0.99, Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a fantastic game. It has the polish and action of a AAA title, not a budget title, and could serve as the perfect black sheep to the family of Sony games that inspired it's creation.\n\nA must buy.","June 20, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/refresz/recommended/249680/","refresz","ref","http://steamcommunity.com/id/refresz/","503 products in account","Decided to write a small opinion about the game since almost no-one from my friendlist have it in their library.\n\ntl;dr: I liked it. Really funny spectacle fighter/brawler game.\n\nMore:\nIt's a your-standard-generic-brawler game, like any DmC or Batman games this days, yet it offers a nice original story to it placed in Mayan ruins (or Aztecs, or Toltecs, or w/e ;)). There are small glitches here and there, the combat system is not as refined as in DmC, but it was a pleasure playing it.\n\nYou are a man who visits your Ancient South America (later referred to as ASA) linguist girlfriend and suddenly you are killed because reasons (not only monsters, but people as well don't like you in this game). However, the weapon you were killed with was possessed by some god of ASA and he recognizes you as The Spirit Warrior who will bring peace to this part of Earth. And so you get resurrected and have a scythe to get through hoardes of mercenaries, possessed mercenaries, ASA warriors and other monsters and gods from ASA believes.\n\nDuring your progress you get more weapons (in total: scythe, rouge-like weapon - my fav, whip with a blade and warhammer with one side bladed) as well as learn some magic by defeating gods (fire, earth, ice and wind). Spells are summoned by using mana.\n\nYou replenish you health by collecting red orbs/masks and mana by collecting blue ones. Your abilities can by upgraded by collecting enough of yellow ones. However the upgrades are simple: each weapon and spell has three levels, and with each level you get more dmg with it, unlock 2 new moves and your health or mana base value gets higher. It's much simpler than in e.g. Darksiders: there you needed to think what to put your exp into, but here, as the weapons and spells are added to your arsenal in balanced manner, almost always you'd get one thing upgraded before having the other one obtained. With that in mind, the fight system is extremely expanded and the actions you get through sometimes are the typical Hollywood star Bruce Willis level of awesomeness actions.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with the game was the mana system. When you are fully upgraded you get to fire exactly 2 spells. But the mana bar doesn't indicate you in any way if you have enough mana to cast the spell, so you mash the buttons once or twice trying to see if it can work. As stated previously, mana is obtainable in form of blue masks (placed directly on map) or blue orbs (flying out of defeated opponent). As fights are mostly in closed area arenas with god-knows-how-much-opponents going to jump at you in next wave (if there will be any, who knows), you try to limit the usage of blue masks nearby. After you die two or three times to some bigger tank monsters and even start using the masks because why the hell not, you find yourself in a place where you need a smallest amount of mana to use the spell one more time, but it doesn't regenerate in time, and isn't replenished with inflicted damage, so you spend time and time until you finish the monster, and voila, blue f-ing orbs which you don't need anymore. And before next fight it is certain that more than one blue mask will appear.\n\nAnother problem I had were some mini-missions/challenges where you would slide down and had to avoid rocks, pits etc. Alice: Nightmare Returns had some similar sequences, but in here the time between when you push the jump button and when it is registered by the character in game was many times too big for me and I've spent countless times on some of those agility jobs.\n\nAnd one smallest issue: the game needs some power to run smoothly. On my machine DmC was running 60fps on 1080p max settings while this one had to be changed to 720p and some of the graphic options needed to be disabled. I know that Unreal Engine which DmC was running on was tended professionally through years, and I have no idea what was Marlow Briggs build on, but I would expect a little more from the game fidelity.\n\nExcept of those two and a half points above the game was really nice: the story was addictive, the fight system, combos included, was sensationally developed and fluent, graphics caught your eyes and had some great sceneries and the music was always on spot. Also, your mask-god companion has a great sense of sarcastic humour and the voice acting for it is great, so you don't get bored.\n\nHaving in mind that it is actually a budget game (€5 without a sale) this is probably one of the best fun to price factor games you can get right now.\n\nI do recommend this totally underestimated game, give it some love, ref!","November 16, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is start-to-finish fast-paced hack-n-slash third-person action and fun set-pieces, only slowing down due to the incompetence of the player, yet even then the game is always pushing you in the right direction. At one point I was stuck and the Mask (companion) gave hints within 1 minute of me running around, and another minute later told me to just push the cart into the pistons, which was all I had to do. The game is also very forgiving with a ridiculous frequency of checkpoints.\nI wasn't even caring about the collectibles and the game still lasted me about 6 hours, 6 hours of straight and varied action with just a touch of puzzle-solving, no filler whatsoever. Looking back the combat seemed a little repetitive, though I guess that was just me using the same combos over and over. People are right when they say it is similar to God of War, though GOW is not on PC....\n\nThe game has an incredibly low asking price on steam, let alone sale price. In terms of value for money, this game is definitely up there. It is easily the best purchase of the summer 2014 sale for me, and one of the best steam purchases ever.","June 27, 2014","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death isn't so bad or terrible that it isn't simply worth playing, but it's a very straight forward God of War clone that didn't keep me interested. The highest mark for this game is the comedic banter between Marlow and the mask - it will make fun of you for dying and Marlow will say a line that is clearly meant to break the fourth wall - commentary that is self-aware. I genuinely laughed when the mask berated me for having magical powers and then jumping off into a pit and asked if I was looking for enemies when I jumped into another.\n\nAll aspects of the game are standard quality for 360 era spectacle fighter, except for some jumpiness with some animations. One cool feature that I like are the frozen cutscenes, involving the camera moving around a scene frozen in time and will "update" as it passes things that obscure's your view. This has maybe been done before, but it was done well before and it was nice to watch these cutscenes.\n\nStill, I found myself uniterested in continuing any further - many other games of this genre do it better, and the comedy and cutscenes are good, but not enough to keep me going. That said it is $5 as of writing, and it meets, arguably, exceeds that value if you intend on finishing it. If your time is limited to better games, I'd only bother if you're really looking forward to some occasional laughs. If you have played all the good spectacle fighters and still want more, then Marlow Briggs is an ok title to add to the list.","September 2, 2014","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a bit less polish but the game doesn't ever take itself seriously. There's 4 different weapons, 4 different powers, and probably 9-10 combos for each weapons. There's no chaining, no real reward for doing combos. Getting hit doesn't interrupt your combo, but it will push you back in most cases making you sit in a recovery time (which will probably run out the combo timer). It's closer to an arcade beatemup than a cuhrazee game.\n\nThe very last weapon you unlock has great weapon feel. It's too bad it was the last one because I really wanted to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of more enemies with it. The base weapon has a pretty mediocre feel, the second weapon has nearly no response, and the 3rd has a pretty cool aoe hitbox, so I'll let it slide.\n\nThere's puzzles in the game, but none that are of any difficulty. However, they're "new" feeling enough to not feel boring.\nI laughed a few times in the game but for the most part it's a pretty cliche "an ancient evil awakens (literally)" storyline. It's not absurd enough or meta enough to really hold my interest too much though.\n\nThe graphics are pretty well displayed, you can tell it's a console port though. It almost feels like an Unreal engine style game graphically. The animations could have some improvement. When Marlow is sliding down a mountain or snow, his model hardly reacts to the ground. It's like he's on a Slip-and-slide. It feels a bit rushed or on a budget, maybe. I don't know any background information on the game.\n\nIn total, I think it was a good arcade style time waster, but I wouldn't go in expecting any sort of depth to anything about it, be it combat, story, or art.\n\nOverall it gets a 6.3/10.\n\n\n","June 28, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death isn't so bad or terrible that it isn't simply worth playing, but it's a very straight forward God of War clone that didn't keep me interested. The highest mark for this game is the comedic banter between Marlow and the mask - it will make fun of you for dying and Marlow will say a line that is clearly meant to break the fourth wall - commentary that is self-aware. I genuinely laughed when the mask berated me for having magical powers and then jumping off into a pit and asked if I was looking for enemies when I jumped into another.\n\nAll aspects of the game are standard quality for 360 era spectacle fighter, except for some jumpiness with some animations. One cool feature that I like are the frozen cutscenes, involving the camera moving around a scene frozen in time and will "update" as it passes things that obscure's your view. This has maybe been done before, but it was done well before and it was nice to watch these cutscenes.\n\nStill, I found myself uniterested in continuing any further - many other games of this genre do it better, and the comedy and cutscenes are good, but not enough to keep me going. That said it is $5 as of writing, and it meets, arguably, exceeds that value if you intend on finishing it. If your time is limited to better games, I'd only bother if you're really looking forward to some occasional laughs. If you have played all the good spectacle fighters and still want more, then Marlow Briggs is an ok title to add to the list.","September 2, 2014","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a pretty good, bombastic, blacksploitation version of God of War for PC. If you've played God of War (or Dantes Inferno for that matter), you'll know the score here. Constantly dancing dealing death with bright weapon trails between simple platforming and puzzle sections.\n\nWhat's great about this game is the standard it sets. For such a small game, it really tries to stand out next to the AAA titles it mimics. The plot is a rather generic, tale of afterlife, revenge and rescuing a damsel in distress. The whole game uses voodoo and industrialism as it's theme, much like God of War uses greek mythology and the Underworld.\n\nThe graphics are pretty spectacular for such a short and budget developed game, with some excellent framed vistas which can be compared to the Uncharted series, the soundtrack can sometimes be repetitve and tiresome but the game is complimented by funny banter between Marlow and the titular Mask of Death, heckling Marlow's 'tough guy' one liners, in a sense, a buddy movie dynamic and not to far away from what the reboot of Shadow Warrior does. The game is full of Hollywood typical explosion visuals and solid sound effects.\n\nOccasionally, the game takes you by surprise and ejects you into a minigame of a race collecting orbs, sliding down pathways avoiding obstacles, or a magnificently over the top on rails shooting section shooting helicopters down from the back of a moving vehicle and finally a top down arcade shooter much like Capcom's 1942 series, which is a pleasant diversion,\n\nThe game took me eight hours to beat in total and if experienced to the hack and slash format, platforming and puzzles that GoW delivers, you'll find no problems getting through the game. Much like GoW acquired weapons and abilities can be upgraded, but the selection is very, very limited and it's incredibly easy to upgrade the weapons using collectable orbs.\n\nThe controls are pretty solid and translated for mouse and keyboard, much like Blades of Time, (another PC hack and slash game), my only issue is using magic abilities using the complicated layout of holding down left control and a numberic key 1-4, which can make fights difficult if you want to attempt to use a magic move to wear enemies down. The boss fights are nothing spectacular and are just more or less obstacles from one section or another or purely acquiring a new ability. There is also no opportunity of back tracking in this game whatsoever and for that matter, nothing to backtrack for.\n\nEven the credits are a bit of fun, you can tell the developers had a lot of fun making this title and it's totally worth a blast for a quick action/adventure/hack and slash title if you want to give it 6-8 hours.

Marlow and the mask have back and forths through out the game that provides some additional comedic relief. There is also actual explanations for the flame jets and general hazards through out the game. Not something that is usually answered.\n\nThe game does kind of hold your hand where it makes it pretty much impossible to jump off an edge unless there's a platform across the chasm, which is annoying. There is also an issue for me where jumping off a rope on to another platform higher up just doesn't happen. I have to be positioned absolutely perfectly for it to let me jump off.

It's a pretty good, bombastic, blacksploitation version of God of War for PC. If you've played God of War (or Dantes Inferno for that matter), you'll know the score here. Constantly dancing dealing death with bright weapon trails between simple platforming and puzzle sections.\n\nWhat's great about this game is the standard it sets. For such a small game, it really tries to stand out next to the AAA titles it mimics. The plot is a rather generic, tale of afterlife, revenge and rescuing a damsel in distress. The whole game uses voodoo and industrialism as it's theme, much like God of War uses greek mythology and the Underworld.\n\nThe graphics are pretty spectacular for such a short and budget developed game, with some excellent framed vistas which can be compared to the Uncharted series, the soundtrack can sometimes be repetitve and tiresome but the game is complimented by funny banter between Marlow and the titular Mask of Death, heckling Marlow's 'tough guy' one liners, in a sense, a buddy movie dynamic and not to far away from what the reboot of Shadow Warrior does. The game is full of Hollywood typical explosion visuals and solid sound effects.\n\nOccasionally, the game takes you by surprise and ejects you into a minigame of a race collecting orbs, sliding down pathways avoiding obstacles, or a magnificently over the top on rails shooting section shooting helicopters down from the back of a moving vehicle and finally a top down arcade shooter much like Capcom's 1942 series, which is a pleasant diversion,\n\nThe game took me eight hours to beat in total and if experienced to the hack and slash format, platforming and puzzles that GoW delivers, you'll find no problems getting through the game. Much like GoW acquired weapons and abilities can be upgraded, but the selection is very, very limited and it's incredibly easy to upgrade the weapons using collectable orbs.\n\nThe controls are pretty solid and translated for mouse and keyboard, much like Blades of Time, (another PC hack and slash game), my only issue is using magic abilities using the complicated layout of holding down left control and a numberic key 1-4, which can make fights difficult if you want to attempt to use a magic move to wear enemies down. The boss fights are nothing spectacular and are just more or less obstacles from one section or another or purely acquiring a new ability. There is also no opportunity of back tracking in this game whatsoever and for that matter, nothing to backtrack for.\n\nEven the credits are a bit of fun, you can tell the developers had a lot of fun making this title and it's totally worth a blast for a quick action/adventure/hack and slash title if you want to give it 6-8 hours. You might find yourself pleasantly surprised.","February 7, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But this game is absolutly amazing, the gameplay has lots of variation,cool hack 'n slash mechanics,over the top action and micheal bay explosion scenes xD. The game has some humor in it and you won't get bored of this game theres some kind of puzzle solving (i guess you could call it) aspect of it that is pretty cool. You have to jump over fires and machines while doging rockets or jungle insects. I am pretty mad that this game din't got too big because it's such a good game with decent graphics (even thou i thought they were sometimes amazing) cool mechanics , really awesome gameplay , original cutscenes etc etc. The beginning is kind of weird in my opinion. I only picked up the game today so I can't really judge the campaign even thou 'till now it's good. I would recommend it to everybody who likes slashing pyromaniacs/warriors/ninjas and much more xD . Now for the bad comment : The game is a lil overpriced just a little lets say take 5 eu/dollars off and it's fine (I bought it in sales wich whas the best 2,09 EU I ever spend on something haha.) The first level I hated for some reason xD bur if you go a little further it becomes awesome!    Anyway I had to make this revieuw because alot of negative comments saying " Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Boredom" but thats just stupid. Add me on steam if we have games incommen so we could play or if you want to have a chat ;-) -Slash *out*","March 29, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The cut scenes are almost a parody on typical Hollywood action movies, and their style is unique and beautiful (although after a while, it may become tedious to some, but you skip them). You've got an intesting 'companion' which constantly is either making fun of you, guiding you, or cheering depending on the situation.\nIf you're into silly humor and action-adventure hack&slash games, you'll totally love this game! It has some great puzzle sections which require some thought, but not too hard to make you get stuck.\nYou start with one weapon, but every hour or so you either get a new weapon or a new magic skill, which broadens your arsenal and keeps the combat fresh. Each weapon is the most efficient against a certain type of enemy, and that makes the combat interesting.\nThe game has a really nice checkpoint system, so that if you die, you almost never have to complete a whole section again. This fixed a frustration that I have with many games nowadays that use a checkpoint system. You also have the option to save manually.\n\nCons\nI would've liked some more enemy variety for regular mobs though. While the boss monsters are quite nice and unique, the same regular enemies keep coming back during the game (but to their credit, they sometimes add a new variety to the insect/human mix).\n\nConclusion\nI've clocked in at around 8 hours to complete this game, which was perfect. It provides constant action and it pushes you forward because of it.I was constantly looking forward to the next encounter, weapon upgrade or silly jokes.\nI picked this game up during the sale, but knowing what I know now, I would've even bought it outside of a sale.","April 5, 2014","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bapabooiee/recommended/249680/","Bapabooiee","Bumpa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bapabooiee/","580 products in account","At first glance, and from popular opinion, this game will seem like an underrated, cheesily self-aware but still-enjoyable spectacle-fighter at a budget price. And it is largely those things, but it's still not far from being mediocre.\n\nWhat the game has going for it is its cheesy, self-aware humor, and it did a great job of delivering on it. I smiled and got some genuine joy out of that aspect quite a number of times. I also enjoyed the set-pieces and technical-efficiency of the game. But past those, it's pretty much your run-of-the-mill CAG/hack-n-slash.\n\nAfter the novelty wore-off for me (maybe 2 hours in), I started to get increasingly bored as I progressed because the combat just didn't deliver. It's your standard button-masher where victory comes relatively easily, and where "Hard" mode doesn't make the game more difficult, but more tedious (eg, less forgiving, so you have to be more liberal with dodging, damage-sponge enemies). Any time I got into an enemy encounter, and couldn't just run past them or quickly kill them by throwing them off a cliff, I would find myself falling asleep, doing the same attacks and dodges repeatedly until everything was dead.\n\nSome other aspects that detracted were:\n\nThe puzzles. They were all mind-numbingly easy, and executing them felt like a punishment.\nThe on-rails sections and quick-time events, because they took-away agency from me.\nThe story. I did mention that the game was pretty funny, and it is, but the story really is nothing special. And the "panorama"-style cutscenes -- which I took great indulgence in the first few times -- eventually got old and hampered the pace of the game. The audio-logs were also pretty pointless.\nOverall, Marlow Briggs is beautiful, funny, and a very competent budget-priced game. But for those who have high standards for games in this genre (think: Ninja Gaiden II), it just doesn't hold-up.","December 2, 2014","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a spectacle fighter with fairly decent gameplay, very good for the price point, I'd say.  Think God of War centered around Rambo's black cousin.\n\nA lot of the attacks don't really feel like they have a lot of weight to them, especially with the Whip, because the enemies don't really react like they were hit or get staggered in any way. The attacks certainly at least look pretty though, and some combos feel very satisfying. Generally the combat system is fairly fleshed out imo. There are a lot of combos and each of the four weapon types has their own combo system.\n\nMy biggest problems with the game are the camera and the fairly frequent crashes. Unless I missed something you have no control of the camera at all. It generally gets the job done but often picks some angles that wouldnt exactly have been my first choice, and sometimes gets kinda awkward. And the game definitely has some stability issues. I don't know if it just hates my machine, but I'd say I crash probably once per 20-30 mins. The games usually fun enough for me to relaunch it and keep going though. But I do strongly advise you to make frequent saves. The checkpoint system is generally alright but doesn't to add more buffers in case you crash (or fall into a pit in a platforming section).\n\nOther less major complaints would include a few turret sections that I didn't love but at least they weren't THAT long or overly frequent (think i've had 3 in a couple hours of gameplay), a few kinda annoying QTEs but again not that many or very long. I could have also lived without the audio-clips from Marlow's girlfriend but I think they can be skipped if they bug you enough.\n\nThe game does have some puzzle and platforming elements that you may or may not enjoy. Persnally I thought the platforming was just challenging enough to not be boring but it didn't get frustrating or overstay its welcome. If nothing else the companion makes a few funny remarks when/if you fail. The puzzles so far have generally been pretty simplistic and I could live without them but can also live with them.\n\nGenerally I'd say I've had a pretty good time with the game, and the positives have outweighed the few problems I've had with the game. The gameplay is pretty enjoyable and I personally rather like the humor with the banter from the companion, the villain, and the occasional 4th wall breaks. Got it on sale for like $1 and I definitely got my money's worth.. and then some.","December 15, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a bit less polish but the game doesn't ever take itself seriously. There's 4 different weapons, 4 different powers, and probably 9-10 combos for each weapons. There's no chaining, no real reward for doing combos. Getting hit doesn't interrupt your combo, but it will push you back in most cases making you sit in a recovery time (which will probably run out the combo timer). It's closer to an arcade beatemup than a cuhrazee game.\n\nThe very last weapon you unlock has great weapon feel. It's too bad it was the last one because I really wanted to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of more enemies with it. The base weapon has a pretty mediocre feel, the second weapon has nearly no response, and the 3rd has a pretty cool aoe hitbox, so I'll let it slide.\n\nThere's puzzles in the game, but none that are of any difficulty. However, they're "new" feeling enough to not feel boring.\nI laughed a few times in the game but for the most part it's a pretty cliche "an ancient evil awakens (literally)" storyline. It's not absurd enough or meta enough to really hold my interest too much though.\n\nThe graphics are pretty well displayed, you can tell it's a console port though. It almost feels like an Unreal engine style game graphically. The animations could have some improvement. When Marlow is sliding down a mountain or snow, his model hardly reacts to the ground. It's like he's on a Slip-and-slide. It feels a bit rushed or on a budget, maybe. I don't know any background information on the game.\n\nIn total, I think it was a good arcade style time waster, but I wouldn't go in expecting any sort of depth to anything about it, be it combat, story, or art.\n\nOverall it gets a 6.3/10.\n\n\n","June 28, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it is nothing more than a God of War clone, it also starts off more exciting than any God of War, well paced and exciting. The problem is in the fact that the game falls apart toward the end, falling into the typical pitfalls of the character action genre, where you spend more time fighting sponges that prolong the game than feeling like you're actually accomplishing something. The first half is where the game is exceptionally entertaining but beyond that, be prepared for monotany.\n\nThat said, for a cheap-♥♥♥ game like this, it sure has great value. Good graphics, sound, and gameplay. The story is weird and silly and the cutscenes seem to come out of nowhere sometimes, but that's part of the cheap-o charm. The game itself, as I said, is a God of War ripoff unabashedly. Which means it has the problems of God of War. Some weapons are completely useless, and the stupid enemies that go underground and burrow up elsewhere are here as well. When emulating or copy and pasting a game, at least leave the bad portions out.\n\nThis is a short, fun, and cheap game that will appeal to character action fans. I won't give it a wholehearted thumbs up, but I do think it is worth your attention.","August 25, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/refresz/recommended/249680/","refresz","ref","http://steamcommunity.com/id/refresz/","503 products in account","Decided to write a small opinion about the game since almost no-one from my friendlist have it in their library.\n\ntl;dr: I liked it. Really funny spectacle fighter/brawler game.\n\nMore:\nIt's a your-standard-generic-brawler game, like any DmC or Batman games this days, yet it offers a nice original story to it placed in Mayan ruins (or Aztecs, or Toltecs, or w/e ;)). There are small glitches here and there, the combat system is not as refined as in DmC, but it was a pleasure playing it.\n\nYou are a man who visits your Ancient South America (later referred to as ASA) linguist girlfriend and suddenly you are killed because reasons (not only monsters, but people as well don't like you in this game). However, the weapon you were killed with was possessed by some god of ASA and he recognizes you as The Spirit Warrior who will bring peace to this part of Earth. And so you get resurrected and have a scythe to get through hoardes of mercenaries, possessed mercenaries, ASA warriors and other monsters and gods from ASA believes.\n\nDuring your progress you get more weapons (in total: scythe, rouge-like weapon - my fav, whip with a blade and warhammer with one side bladed) as well as learn some magic by defeating gods (fire, earth, ice and wind). Spells are summoned by using mana.\n\nYou replenish you health by collecting red orbs/masks and mana by collecting blue ones. Your abilities can by upgraded by collecting enough of yellow ones. However the upgrades are simple: each weapon and spell has three levels, and with each level you get more dmg with it, unlock 2 new moves and your health or mana base value gets higher. It's much simpler than in e.g. Darksiders: there you needed to think what to put your exp into, but here, as the weapons and spells are added to your arsenal in balanced manner, almost always you'd get one thing upgraded before having the other one obtained. With that in mind, the fight system is extremely expanded and the actions you get through sometimes are the typical Hollywood star Bruce Willis level of awesomeness actions.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with the game was the mana system. When you are fully upgraded you get to fire exactly 2 spells. But the mana bar doesn't indicate you in any way if you have enough mana to cast the spell, so you mash the buttons once or twice trying to see if it can work. As stated previously, mana is obtainable in form of blue masks (placed directly on map) or blue orbs (flying out of defeated opponent). As fights are mostly in closed area arenas with god-knows-how-much-opponents going to jump at you in next wave (if there will be any, who knows), you try to limit the usage of blue masks nearby. After you die two or three times to some bigger tank monsters and even start using the masks because why the hell not, you find yourself in a place where you need a smallest amount of mana to use the spell one more time, but it doesn't regenerate in time, and isn't replenished with inflicted damage, so you spend time and time until you finish the monster, and voila, blue f-ing orbs which you don't need anymore. And before next fight it is certain that more than one blue mask will appear.\n\nAnother problem I had were some mini-missions/challenges where you would slide down and had to avoid rocks, pits etc. Alice: Nightmare Returns had some similar sequences, but in here the time between when you push the jump button and when it is registered by the character in game was many times too big for me and I've spent countless times on some of those agility jobs.\n\nAnd one smallest issue: the game needs some power to run smoothly. On my machine DmC was running 60fps on 1080p max settings while this one had to be changed to 720p and some of the graphic options needed to be disabled. I know that Unreal Engine which DmC was running on was tended professionally through years, and I have no idea what was Marlow Briggs build on, but I would expect a little more from the game fidelity.\n\nExcept of those two and a half points above the game was really nice: the story was addictive, the fight system, combos included, was sensationally developed and fluent, graphics caught your eyes and had some great sceneries and the music was always on spot. Also, your mask-god companion has a great sense of sarcastic humour and the voice acting for it is great, so you don't get bored.\n\nHaving in mind that it is actually a budget game (€5 without a sale) this is probably one of the best fun to price factor games you can get right now.\n\nI do recommend this totally underestimated game, give it some love, ref!","November 16, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great voice acting, a script with great banter, beautiful vistas, and a surprisingly good combat system, the only flaws I found with it were the lack of proper options and slight framerate drops during cutscenes and moments where the action got too intense. The whole game has been a ridiculously fun rollercoaster the entire way through so far, and I recommend buying it while it's so cheap.\n\n","June 22, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is start-to-finish fast-paced hack-n-slash third-person action and fun set-pieces, only slowing down due to the incompetence of the player, yet even then the game is always pushing you in the right direction. At one point I was stuck and the Mask (companion) gave hints within 1 minute of me running around, and another minute later told me to just push the cart into the pistons, which was all I had to do. The game is also very forgiving with a ridiculous frequency of checkpoints.\nI wasn't even caring about the collectibles and the game still lasted me about 6 hours, 6 hours of straight and varied action with just a touch of puzzle-solving, no filler whatsoever. Looking back the combat seemed a little repetitive, though I guess that was just me using the same combos over and over. People are right when they say it is similar to God of War, though GOW is not on PC....\n\nThe game has an incredibly low asking price on steam, let alone sale price. In terms of value for money, this game is definitely up there. It is easily the best purchase of the summer 2014 sale for me, and one of the best steam purchases ever.","June 27, 2014","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The parts that aren't God of War are clones of other games you probably know. However, I found it difficult to get bored because the game goes batshit crazy at a breakneck pace. It's laugh-out-loud exhilarating and heart-pounding hilarious.\n\nIt belongs to an elite class of games like Killer Is Dead and Monkey Island - while you're playing, the game seems to be having as much fun as you are.\n\nYou can tell that it was made on a shoestring budget - every unncessary corner has been cut, but no shortcuts were taken where it counts. Cutscenes are kept to frozen key frames, but those frames are gorgeous. The characters are simple, but fantastically acted. Combat's just God of War, but it's God of War done very right.\n\nIssues include some minor control issues during platforming and some awkward camera angles, but these are the rough edges of an uncut diamond. Even when I got frustrated with repeating one section over and over again, I couldn't stay mad for long before a beautiful view and a great kill animation had me cackling with delight.\n\n9.5/10","August 29, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do not ever recall this game being advertised but it is a good game.\n\nThe main villian is trying to get immortality. He enlists the help of your girlfriend. When she decides to leave they kill you to make her finish her work. You are brought back to life to stop this guy from getting supernatural abilities. As far as the plot goes, that is about it.\n\nFor a pretty straight forword storyline, you travel to many locations and fight a good variety of creatures. The boss battles are interesting and cool looking.\n\nThe things that will annoy you  in this game are first off the talking mask that follows you. He is not very informative and seams to suffer from exceptional hindsite. Secondly at certain parts of the game (mostly when getting new upgrades or end of boss battles) the game does a stop motion revolving take of what is going on. As it turns the scenes change and then you go on into the next area. Way to often! Lastly THE INVISIBLE WALLS. there are times when you plan a jump only to hit an invisible wall killing you prompting that mask to make another snide remake about how that should not of happened.\n\nAll in all it is a good game with decent fighting mechanics.

I don't know what they are smoking. Sure, given it's low price i can understand that many start the game with low expectations about it. But i found this game amazing, deserving well more than 5 bucks. As soon as you get to the main menu, you are greeted to one of the best epic main menu songs out there. Everytime i started the game, i couldn't help but listening to the music for at least 2 minutes. The rest of the music are ok, but this song makes up for all of them. Now speaking of the game, it's a ripoff of God of War, but a pretty good one. The story surely sucks, but there's plenty of funny dialog. The graphics are decent and the game is surprisingly well optimized for PC. Now speaking of the gameplay, it's mostly an Hack and Slash. There's a light and a heavy attack that you can combo, and a grab, block and jump buttons. There's 4 weapons and 5 magic powers that you collect, and they all play differently. You can also upgrade them. The combat is good, with a solid variety of enemy types and bosses, but blocking fells a bit off because you can't block in the middle of an attack, so you'll be evading most of the time. Besides combat, there are also sections of platforming (those could be better), puzzle solving, evading obstacles, 3D shooting and top down shooting. Together, it'll last about 6 hours, and if you are like me, you'll play right again on the hardcore difficulty, which isn't really that hard except for some encounters later in the game. For it's price, it has a good lenght. And you can also replay some challenges from the story in the menu with leaderboards, but for me only the first time was added. Probably a bug, but didn't care much about it. And there's also a minigame in the credits, which sucks but lets you skip the credits the faster you complete it. It was a nice addition to finish the game. In the end, the game isn't brilliant, but surprisingly good given it's price, and you should definitely get it if you're a fan of Hack and Slash games. And one sale, it's a steal.","October 12, 2015","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

His only aim is to rescue his girlfriend and stopping the old chinese of destroying the world. Xibalba can wait. Under the guidance of his new buddy, a flying mask, he starts to fight everything the jungle and militia have to offer - or he is just making some damn silly jokes. The gameplay isn't special.

Luckly this game proven me wrong in a way. I played couple of levels now and the story is intrestering, its just like watching Indiana Jones. The gameplay is easy to adapt to, and you get good hints if you get stuck too long in the game by the mysterious "Mask of Death". I also found the mask to be having a very dark sense of humor. While  many consider Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death to be a bad game, what makes it stand out is that it was designed to be a bad game: which suddenly elevates it into so-bad-it-is-actually-great game.\n\nTechnical: So here are a few downsides. For all the great aspects of the game the limited budget does show through in some of the animations. Collision errors occur sometimes where characters are holding things and I did encounter one fall-through-the-world glitch. Those are the only major bad points. On the good side, the enemies are programmed with AI that acknowledges more than just yourself as an enemy. So for instance, if the human enemies encounter the giant bug enemies they will fight amongst themselves while also fighting you. None of that, "Why are the human soldiers working in perfect tandem with the giant ♥♥♥♥♥ monsters from Mars?" problems a lot of games have. Other than that everything if perfectly functional if a little raw in some places.\n\n\nMarlow Briggs and the Mask of the Death is an action game inspired by blockbuster films, comic book heroes, and other action games and is filled with exciting combat and gameplay. I played the game using a X-Box controller, so the gameplay wasn't as bad when I tried it just using the keyboard.\n\nMarlow Briggs is a mix of Shadowman, Soul Reaver and God of War. Its not as well scripted, the acting is cery clichê, while the mask of death repetetive lines, can at times become very annoying. Overall the game gives you a decent amount of fun.  The quest are overall very easy and not very challenging, even on hard difficulty. You may complete the game in 11 hours play.","January 1, 2014","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's be clear here. This game is a shameless,  complete ripoff of God of War in everything except that it takes place in modern times and features South American mythology instead of Ancient Greece. I chuckled everytime I came across a new mechanic that was lifted straight from God of War. The graphics in this game are really good for a budget title. The locales in the game are a bit generic. There isn't anything that hasn't been seen before. The gameplay is broken up somewhat by sections where you're flying a plane and the game plays out in the style of a top-down shooter. There are also sections where you are sliding down a hill and are going for the quickest time down it.  It took around 7 hours to finish the game. It really was easy. There were only a couple times I had to re-fight battles. I usually died from misjudging jumps.  If you are in the mood for another God of War type gaming experience on the cheap, then I heartily endorse Marlow Briggs.","July 5, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When those games first hit the market, videos games as an industry woul never be the same.  In a market that constantly demands innovation, development of new concepts and methods of interaction, it can be easy to forget how amazing certain tried and true formula can be.  I STILL love playing God of War...  and this game, is a shameless clone/update, call it what you will.  Graphically upated, and skinned in a different mythos, Kratos becomes Marlow.\n\nThis games isn't promising anything revolutionary.  It also refuses to take itself seriously.  The production value is solid, the voice acting well done.  The narrator that is Marlow's "spirit guide" i suppose, is constantly making wise cracks.  I found the game delightful.\n\nEvery time I wanted to put the controller down, it kept pulling me back in...  a familiar feeling.  It isn't perfect and it doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it brought back a play style and experience that I feel you don't find enough in modern gaming.  I think someone described it as being able to play a 90's action blockbuster....  fairly dead on.\n\nGet it on sale and you will not be dissapointed.  It's FUN.  Engaging and you will not have to think to hard.  Everyting in it takes place on an epic scale.  An abundance of great Mini-games too.\n\nI am not finished with the game at this point.

Kinchen) has lso voiced a certain saint in a different game XD\n\nBest way to summarize it:\nPierce get its own movie with Michael Bay in charge of the fight scenes and Crash bandicoot Mask "Aku Aku" as an hilarious sidekick!\n\nMy advice: Play it!

As far as the plot goes, that is about it.\n\nFor a pretty straight forword storyline, you travel to many locations and fight a good variety of creatures. The boss battles are interesting and cool looking.\n\nThe things that will annoy you  in this game are first off the talking mask that follows you. He is not very informative and seams to suffer from exceptional hindsite. Secondly at certain parts of the game (mostly when getting new upgrades or end of boss battles) the game does a stop motion revolving take of what is going on. As it turns the scenes change and then you go on into the next area. Way to often! Lastly THE INVISIBLE WALLS. there are times when you plan a jump only to hit an invisible wall killing you prompting that mask to make another snide remake about how that should not of happened.\n\nAll in all it is a good game with decent fighting mechanics.

It's definitely worth the money that they're asking for it, but there are a few flaws that made the game not nearly as enjoyable for me. The worst flaw for me was definitely the fixed camera. For the most part, the camera was in a place that was okay, but at some points, I would have killed to actually be able to move it at some parts. The platforming early on also really aggravated me, as it is somewhat awkward and difficult to get used to. That isn't really that big of a deal though, and it shouldn't be too much of an issue once you progress into the game. I also didn't really like how the game basically just turned into me mashing one button for all of the fights, since I didn't feel very rewarded to do combos in fights. There is also a weapon later in the game that basically stun-locks most opponents if you just do the three hit strong attack combo. Other than those gripes, I did enjoy the game, and I'd say that it's very much worth your money to buy it.","December 30, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes it's the games that just want to have fun that make you enjoy your time with them the most. Marlow Briggs fits this description so aptly. The voice acting is decent but still has the cheese to really emphasize the B movie style. Marlow is actually voiced by Pierce from the Saints Row series.\n\nThe combat is solid with a lot of combos. You're given the ability to do light and heavy hits, but there's no automatic counter attack button which means that you still need to pay attention to the game to win. The enemy variety is rather decent. You'll fight bugs, big guys who want to melee you and guys with rocket launchers and flamethrowers. The enemies are dispatched kind of simuilarly but the amount of combos at your disposal means that you can vary it up yourself.\n\nThe game is about 6-8 hours in length depending on how you play.\n\n\nOverall an enjoyable experience and a steal for $5. Highly recommended.","March 7","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Luckly this game proven me wrong in a way. I played couple of levels now and the story is intrestering, its just like watching Indiana Jones. The gameplay is easy to adapt to, and you get good hints if you get stuck too long in the game by the mysterious "Mask of Death". I also found the mask to be having a very dark sense of humor. While  many consider Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death to be a bad game, what makes it stand out is that it was designed to be a bad game: which suddenly elevates it into so-bad-it-is-actually-great game.\n\nTechnical: So here are a few downsides. For all the great aspects of the game the limited budget does show through in some of the animations. Collision errors occur sometimes where characters are holding things and I did encounter one fall-through-the-world glitch. Those are the only major bad points. On the good side, the enemies are programmed with AI that acknowledges more than just yourself as an enemy. So for instance, if the human enemies encounter the giant bug enemies they will fight amongst themselves while also fighting you. None of that, "Why are the human soldiers working in perfect tandem with the giant ♥♥♥♥♥ monsters from Mars?" problems a lot of games have. Other than that everything if perfectly functional if a little raw in some places.\n\n\nMarlow Briggs and the Mask of the Death is an action game inspired by blockbuster films, comic book heroes, and other action games and is filled with exciting combat and gameplay. I played the game using a X-Box controller, so the gameplay wasn't as bad when I tried it just using the keyboard.\n\nMarlow Briggs is a mix of Shadowman, Soul Reaver and God of War. Its not as well scripted, the acting is cery clichê, while the mask of death repetetive lines, can at times become very annoying. Overall the game gives you a decent amount of fun.  The quest are overall very easy and not very challenging, even on hard difficulty. You may complete the game in 11 hours play.","January 1, 2014","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's be clear here. This game is a shameless,  complete ripoff of God of War in everything except that it takes place in modern times and features South American mythology instead of Ancient Greece. I chuckled everytime I came across a new mechanic that was lifted straight from God of War. The graphics in this game are really good for a budget title. The locales in the game are a bit generic. There isn't anything that hasn't been seen before. The gameplay is broken up somewhat by sections where you're flying a plane and the game plays out in the style of a top-down shooter. There are also sections where you are sliding down a hill and are going for the quickest time down it.  It took around 7 hours to finish the game. It really was easy. There were only a couple times I had to re-fight battles. I usually died from misjudging jumps.  If you are in the mood for another God of War type gaming experience on the cheap, then I heartily endorse Marlow Briggs.","July 5, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He awakens as the "sacred warrior", accompanied by an annoying talking mask, and must battle through hordes of mercenary mooks, jungles full of exploding bugs the size of dogs, scorpions the size of cars, and giant zombie warriors.\n\nLike its obvious antecedent God of War, it's a reasonably solid mix of platforming and button-mashing combat (long "combos" created through the light and heavy attack buttons, with four different weapons unlocked through the game), with occasional puzzles. As is often the case with this sort of design, it doesn't do any one thing particularly well -- the Arkham games ruined combat for everyone else, and it definitely gets repetitive here, and the platforming sequences are uninspiring make-work. There are also a number of strange mini-game sequences, e.g. manning a turret to shoot down helicopters and two instances of flying an aircraft in a particularly terrible Raiden-style top-down shooter.\n\nWhere it really shines, though, like God of War, is as blockbuster spectacle -- a "boss" that's an enormous screen-filling sea monster, platforming through a collapsing mine etc. The story isn't much to write home about it but it provides a reason to hurtle from one explosive crisis to the next. It's entirely linear.\n\nThe variety of environments and enemies is fairly good, though the game is relatively short (~6 hours). It's not stunningly polished; there are invisible walls everywhere, occasional issues with the controls etc.\n\nSome negative reviews here complain about checkpoint spacing, which I wuold agree with except that it appears to be possible to create your own checkpoint at any time with a quicksave from the menu.\n\nIt's good fun and available so cheaply that it's well worth giving a go.","April 9","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Low Budget Spectacle Fun.Genre: 3rd Person Action Spectacle Fighter.\nDeveloped & Published by: Zootfly & 505 Games.\nPlatform: Windows and Xbox 360.\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nI’m not entirely sure what you can expect from such an obvious low budget videogame. But being fun isn't one of those things normally. This game is surprisingly solid both mechanically and its story, even if it takes neither of those things seriously. The effort put in shows. Sure, the game’s plot is as 2-dimensional as a standard platformer and the character's don't have much of a backstory but it's pretty darn fun. Especially when you have a SHMUP sequence thrown at you and doesn't feel out of place. The game switches between action spectacle and puzzle/platforming to keep things moving.\n\nStory Thoughts\nYou follow the adventures of Firefighter Marlow Briggs who gets killed by an industrialist voiced by the noodles guy from Kung Fu Panda. (It sounds like him and I’m pretty certain it is, but the credits don't say and IMDB doesn't credit him with the part). The guy who is voice acting him is clearly having tons of fun with the role. There is so much ham and cheese to his villany, you can't help but giggle. After being resurrected by a Mayan Mask of Death, Briggs must fight through hordes of enemies and gods in exotic Mayan locations to save his loved one from the evil industrialist before he achieves his ultimate goal of becoming a Mayan God. The story is rife with mentions of Mayan culture and their gods.\n\nCombat Mechanics\nYou get the use of a weird scythe-like weapon which has three other versions of itself as well as four elemental powers you can use to devastate numerous enemies. The different variations allow you to attack in different ways and with different spells. One is a mace-like weapon that's slower but hits harder. Another is a scythe for faster if weaker attacks and so on. The hack and slash elements are well done and flashy, if standard. You recover health and mana via other death masks items found in the level as well as off fallen enemies. The only hidden items in this game are XP masks and they aren't too hard to find.\n\nPC Settings and Audio/Video\nMarlow Briggs has a fairly lacking options menu. Game will only display in 16:9 resolutions (with 50, 59, 60Hz options for some resolutions). It’s letterboxed or cropped depending on the differing aspect ratios. AA, V-Sync, Field of View and anisotropic filtering can’t be changed. The AA used seems to be FXAA according to PCGamingWiki[pcgamingwiki.com]. Keys can be rebound if needed though I suggest running this game with a controller. You should be fine without one but spectacle fighters tend to play better with a controller. Audio sliders include: effects, music, dialog and master volume. Can’t go wrong with those choices.\n\nGraphics are a modern day realistic style. It's ok but a bit low-fidelity. Soundtrack is an over the top orchestral collection of tracks with big bombastic choirs singing. There is one thing I should note. Many of the “cutscenes” are a collection of still images of Briggs in a, for lack of a better term, badass pose. Whether its slicing enemies apart or leaping over a boulder, it doesn't matter. Sort of like a very fancy 3D slideshow. I still can’t tell if the devs were saving money, being artsy or confident in their graphics team. It’s a little weird when you're playing the game but I guess it works. Oh one final note, there are challenge modes but I didn't really bother with them.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nSummed up, Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is an average game that somehow kept me entertained the entire time. I think the combination of over the top action, voice acting and a care-free attitude in the developers is why. The pace is just about right too. This isn't game-of-the-year material, it’s not the best of the genre and its not a unforgettable experience but Marlow isn't trying to waste your time either. Each level doesn't outstay its welcome and the combat remains challenging without getting too aggravating. Characters are fairly well fleshed out too and you get some reason to care about them. So, consider picking it up if you need a new spectacle fighter.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","July 29, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the most part, the camera was in a place that was okay, but at some points, I would have killed to actually be able to move it at some parts. The platforming early on also really aggravated me, as it is somewhat awkward and difficult to get used to. That isn't really that big of a deal though, and it shouldn't be too much of an issue once you progress into the game. I also didn't really like how the game basically just turned into me mashing one button for all of the fights, since I didn't feel very rewarded to do combos in fights.

I STILL love playing God of War...  and this game, is a shameless clone/update, call it what you will.  Graphically upated, and skinned in a different mythos, Kratos becomes Marlow.\n\nThis games isn't promising anything revolutionary.  It also refuses to take itself seriously.  The production value is solid, the voice acting well done.  The narrator that is Marlow's "spirit guide" i suppose, is constantly making wise cracks.  I found the game delightful.\n\nEvery time I wanted to put the controller down, it kept pulling me back in...  a familiar feeling.  It isn't perfect and it doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it brought back a play style and experience that I feel you don't find enough in modern gaming.  I think someone described it as being able to play a 90's action blockbuster....  fairly dead on.\n\nGet it on sale and you will not be dissapointed.  It's FUN.

The addition of difficulty settings helps the cause as well.\nHonestly, it is a good thing the game only takes about 6 hours to beat.  If it were any longer it would wear you out and get boring.  It is just long enough to introduce the characters and humor, let you get in some good fights, power up, and then it is done, inviting you to come back later on to try a harder difficulty.

The answer is... well, lots of things actually, but Marlow Briggs is perhaps one of the least well-known of the various clones that have spawned as a result of the aforementioned combination. It's a budget title with little in the way of innovation or originality, and its lumpen, cheese-tastic story is nothing to write home about, but in here lurks a fun, respectable, though flawed action game.\n\nPerhaps the best thing about Marlow Briggs is that the action rarely lets up, as it shifts from set piece to set piece, never really giving you a chance to get bored as you deal with waves of enemies by using a variety of combos to slice them to pieces. Throughout the 6-7 hour campaign you're furnished with a number of new weapons and magic powers, all of which are then upgraded via XP that you earn from kills and pick-ups. Along the way you'll find plenty of health and mana pick-ups too, helping you to replenish your stock ahead of the next big fight. It's a relatively simple system, and the combos aren't too difficult to master, though you'll probably stick to a couple of good ones and use those throughout. Along the way you'll be taking out human enemies, insects and spirits, along with a few boss battles to spice things up, and all with a smooth, easy-to-learn control scheme.\n\nHonestly, I was really enjoying Marlow Briggs up until around the halfway mark, where the game then insists on giving you incredibly tanky enemies that take far too long to kill, artifically increasing the difficulty and the length of the game in doing so. As fun as it was to slice and dice my way around, I felt like the tanky enemies began to detract from the enjoyment of the game, with spirit creatures that disappear every few seconds, forcing you to spend longer running around as you slice away at them until they finally go down. I began to get frustrated with some of the enemy encounters in the second half of the game, though unlocking some weapons and powers did help to satisfy my desire to finish out the game. These encounters won't kill the appeal of the game for you, but they might make the last few hours of it less palatable.\n\nIt's hard not to recommend Marlow Briggs at just £4. You're getting a decent game, and you may even improve the experience a tad by dropping the difficulty level down to Casual (I played on Normal), where the tankier enemy encounters that pop up constantly in the second half might be a bit more tolerable. I was impressed that the game has a bit of gusto, and though I encountered a few bugs and glitches, it was a smooth experience overall. There's a bit of humour and self-awareness to the whole thing, and the game never takes itself too seriously. Oh and James Hong is in it, and he's pretty much playing Lo Pan from Big Trouble in Little China again. So if that's not going to sell you on it, I'm not sure anything will!","January 18","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

None of the parts of this game is really perfect, but as an overall game it is quite good.\n\nEverything is in this game you would expect and more: turrent sections and vertical scrolling shooter sections, sliding while collecting orb section etc. These sections are of proper length, not outstaying their welcome. I really liked the design of the gigantic ore harvester which is one of the major area's you play on.\n\nThe combat is a bit button mashy, but satisfying enough. Some of the jumping puzzles and fights can get a bit frustrating, for example by respawn points just a bit too far away or some cheap deaths not really your fault or that it is not very clear what is expected to do next.","January 20","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No game with this small a budget should look this good, no game with this small a team should PLAY this good, and no premise as absurd as this should work as well as it does. Yes, it's short, but it's also dirt cheap, and the four hours I spent on this game alone make it an incredibly worthwhile experience. It's funny, amazingly well paced, looks great and has some suprisingly good combat for being a God of War clone. It's a game I think everyone should play at least 20 minutes of, so they can see and bask in the glory of Marlow ♥♥♥♥ing Briggs.\n\nWhat i'm trying to say is that you should play this game because it's really damn good.","May 10","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He awakens as the "sacred warrior", accompanied by an annoying talking mask, and must battle through hordes of mercenary mooks, jungles full of exploding bugs the size of dogs, scorpions the size of cars, and giant zombie warriors.\n\nLike its obvious antecedent God of War, it's a reasonably solid mix of platforming and button-mashing combat (long "combos" created through the light and heavy attack buttons, with four different weapons unlocked through the game), with occasional puzzles. As is often the case with this sort of design, it doesn't do any one thing particularly well -- the Arkham games ruined combat for everyone else, and it definitely gets repetitive here, and the platforming sequences are uninspiring make-work. There are also a number of strange mini-game sequences, e.g. manning a turret to shoot down helicopters and two instances of flying an aircraft in a particularly terrible Raiden-style top-down shooter.\n\nWhere it really shines, though, like God of War, is as blockbuster spectacle -- a "boss" that's an enormous screen-filling sea monster, platforming through a collapsing mine etc. The story isn't much to write home about it but it provides a reason to hurtle from one explosive crisis to the next. It's entirely linear.\n\nThe variety of environments and enemies is fairly good, though the game is relatively short (~6 hours). It's not stunningly polished; there are invisible walls everywhere, occasional issues with the controls etc.\n\nSome negative reviews here complain about checkpoint spacing, which I wuold agree with except that it appears to be possible to create your own checkpoint at any time with a quicksave from the menu.\n\nIt's good fun and available so cheaply that it's well worth giving a go.","April 9","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
