Very interesting quests and ingame story\n2. Galaxy-exploring process actually gives you benefits\n3. In some ways this games feels a lot like "Space Rangers 2"\n4. Nice music\n5. Awesome dialogues\n\nCons\n1. Clunky fighting-system (You can't skip turns during planet battles, which sometimes is very disturbing)\n2. No character customization (At all) P.S. but you can customize your ship by adding different modules\n3. Planet exploration is quite boring. Plantes only differ with tiles and atmosphere (You can breathe or you can't). There isn't much point in exploring them.\n\nI give this game 8/10\nNice RL version of Space Rangers.","April 9","true","2.4"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

The game is not even remotely rogue-like, it even has an auto-save function plus you can save/load at any time. Also there is not much replayability value.\n\n2. It features a lot of story telling with some exploration, it plays more like a gamebook. So expect simple graphics and A LOT of text, especially tons of background infos and secondary character dialogs which don't change much in the end.\n\n3. The game is playable although unfinished and hence rather short. I'm now 10hours into it and I think I've completed the main story and nearly all side quests. (The remaining one(s) require a lot of search which gets difficult towards the end of the game because of performance issues, a bug I guess.)\n\nAll in all I think it's worth the 5 Euros and although it not even comes close (yet) to the size and depth of Space Rangers 2, it feels a bit like that, minus the annoying realtime ground combat.","April 21","true","10.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I am so excited to see this game expanded upon and already it is very fun.\n\nThis is the first space game I've played where I truly feel like a captain of a star ship.\n\nFor example after a landing party mission I lost a marine to alien creatures. Upon return to earth I got a message from the crewmates mother cursing me for her sons death. I never before felt the burden of command like I did at that moment.\n\n10/10 and looking forward to each new update!\n\n","April 26","true","4.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Even at this stage this game is fairly playable. It have very interesting and well written storyline and side quests. The only things that disappointed me was surface explorations of planets - they all just randomized set of just, like, 5 type of tiles. But I hope that will be improved in future. In all - very interesting game, strongly resembling Star Control 2 and riddled with nice easter eggs.","April 10","true","8.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Easily worth the time and money!\n\nAuroraRL is your basic star exploration game.  You shuttle between planets and between solar systems.  At each planet you can scan and (if possible) land to collect resources, alien technology and artificats, and to kill creatures.  The controls are pretty straightforward and somewhat of a throwback to an earlier time (twenty five years or so ago), where you moved in blocks, as a group.\n\nThere isn't a ton yet to this game.  But once you get past the introductory few exercises, there are some decent character and race interactions.  But the groundwork for a truly awesome and excellent game is here.\n\nThere are a few annoying bugs -- the game has crashed twice and two really inopportune times.  It's all part of a game being developed.  But I haven't been this excited about a game in a long time.\n\nTime will tell what kind of support the devlopers give to their gaming community.  My hope is...a lot of timely stuff.","April 10","true","4.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"
