It is short but it takes an important first step in making a music video actually work in VR. Now I have seen other music videos in VR like the Run the Jewels video which is part of Wevr Transport. Even though that video was also great it had a fixed camera and it felt more like watching a 360 video(which is basically what it was) and less like I was actually in that space. Surge is different in that it is made in the Unreal Engine and has positional tracking and the whole package which means you feel like you are actually there. Couple that with amazing set pieces which go along perfectly with the music and cram it into a short music video and you have Surge. Its free so I definitively recommend you try it out.","May 24","true","0.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

But then, since I spent half the time looking around to see if something else was hapening elsewhere, it might be good thing that the little action there was was slow.\n\nOverall, it's an interesting view of what music videos can become, but I can't say that this one was a good example. Try it if you want, it's free and short so you won't lose money nor time, and maybe you'll like it (it's art after all, so it's very subjective)","May 24","false","0.1"," 2 of 39 people (5%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","5","2","39","3","1"
