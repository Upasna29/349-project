The music really mellows you out, and the artwork is fitting extremely well done; simple but elegant. The puzzles come in all shapes and sizes with a few minigames for variety's sake. They arent easy enough to make the game boring, nor are they impossible because of the game's voluntary hint system (which I think is clever). Even the one or two hard puzzles that you can't use hints on (I'm looking at you world map) are beatable if you rack your brain a bit and give you a pleasant sense of accomplishment. Its a game that one would enjoy playing between games, something to relax and fall in to after a disasterous game of league, doto, or cs.\n\nMy only complaint is that this game is too short and that I'm going to miss it when I finish it :c","November 4, 2014","true","3.8"," 59 of 64 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","59","64","2","0"

I bought it based on all the positive reviews, and while I did enjoy it (mostly), and I do recommend the game (on sale), I still have a bunch of curmudgeonly gripes.\n\nSTORY\nIt didn't feel like there was much of a story. The wordless intro clip only show a basic scenario: meteor hits planet, planet breaks into puzzle pieces, you need to find them all and fix the planet. Not much of a plotline, just an excuse for the player to do stuff. The store description says that the world "fell apart" and "its future depends on you", but I honestly expected a bit more for the main objective than literally putting a picture puzzle back together. And aside from the puzzle pieces, the actual game feels disconnected from the initial "story" idea; it doesn't seem like there's any dire trouble to tackle in the world - just finding misplaced parts and accessing new areas. There's not much that connects the minigames, puzzles, and hidden object bits to an actual story, anyway. Yes, the puzzle pieces fix the planet. But how does anything else in the game itself factor into the "story"? I know that's being nitpicky, but if "Story" is in your title, there should at least be more plot-like connections between the tasks a player must complete.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nYou get a couple of initial tutorial arrows showing what to click on, but then you're on your own. The puzzle piece hunt is obvious, but you still have to click around to find out what parts of the scene need "fixing". Those bits give you an secondary objective to find a certain number of objects (gears, pipes, dice, etc) to fix the broken part. Sort of a semi-hidden-object hunt. After fixing your ladder/panel/door/whatever, you either unlock another area, or are presented with a minigame/puzzle to complete in order to get the last piece for another secondary objective. Basically, "Find all the _____, or else you'll never get that last _____." At least clicks are precise, and the movement between scenes/areas is very fluid.\n\nMINIGAMES/PUZZLES\nMany of the puzzles were very familiar/common in other games. But there are a handful I haven't seen in P&Cs/HoGs before, and the difficulty varied, which was nice. Either way, you get NO instructions once you start. Some are intuitive - like the "Simon Says" levers, or a version of that tube puzzle where you rotate pipes to complete a network. But many have you scratching your head before you realize what you're supposed to be doing in the first place. (I spent far too long on the Compass "puzzle" until I looked up the solution out of frustration.) At least you can click the red X to exit and reset everything if you mess up.\n\nI really didn't like the action 'video game' minigames you're forced to play to continue, and was very glad there were only two. They're 8-bit obstacle games: one guiding a boat up and down to avoid walls, and one moving a plane left and right to avoid trees and planes. If you crash even once, you start over. They're not all that difficult, but they introduce an unwelcome level of stress that I generally play P&Cs/HoGs to avoid.\n\nOh, and forget about finishing the game if you get stuck. You can't skip a single thing. Not cool.\n\nHINT SYSTEM\nThe hint system is cute, but iffy. Click on the blue flies to fill the "?" meter. Once it's full and clicked, a red bug will fly out and circle around whatever you're supposed to click or focus on next. The problem is that if you're in the wrong scene within a level, the bug will simply fly to the edge of the screen to the signpost arrow. I understand that means the next 'piece' or whatever is not in the current scene, but when you move to the next scene the bug disappears. So all you really got as a hint was "Nope, it's not here". Then the hint bar won't release a bug again for quite a while, even when full. I don't know what the timer is on it, but it's annoying to unknowingly "waste" hints like that. It's not difficult to refill the meter, but that really doesn't do much good if you can't use it.\n\nVARIETY\nThe description calls each chapter "vastly different". I disagree with most of that. Different, somewhat. Vastly, no. Any major differences between levels are purely cosmetic. It's just different scenes, music, and what type of objects you need to find. The minigames/puzzles themselves are obviously going to be different, but that's expected for any game like this, so I wouldn't consider that a "vast" difference.\nThe tasks in each level are pretty much the same:\n1) Find all the hidden puzzle pieces.\n2) Find multiple objects to "fix" things so you can progress. Objects are hidden in similar ways in each level (behind panels, overlaying a similar shape, blending into the background, etc).\n3) Help some random person (usually just a version of "find this many ____").\n4) Solve a handful of minigames or puzzles.\n5) Put the puzzle pieces together at the end of each level.\nThat said, it didn't take long for it to feel a little repetitive.\n\nENDING\nWhat ending? When you complete the world puzzle, you're put in a room with the people you helped out. Initially you think it's a bonus level, but then you realize all you can do is change the radio to play music from each level, and in the next room you can replay each minigame/puzzle individually. Beyond that...what exactly was accomplished? It's very anticlimactic and unfulfilling.\n\nREPLAY VALUE\nNone whatsoever. You can't complete a level if you don't find/solve everything, so once you play through, you're done. Maybe it has replay value if you want to revisit a minigame. But I don't see myself loading this up again just to play a puzzle with a 1-minute-or-less solution.\n\nCONCLUSION\nDespite my nitpicking, I do recommend the game to PoC/HoG fans (wait for a sale though - save the $5 for a latte or something). The lovely art and music are worth a look, at the very least. If the game was any more expensive, I'd probably just go look at some nice galleries on deviantART instead. But honestly I can't comment/complain about value, since I got it on sale for $0.49.\n\nDevelopers: Beautiful game, nice puzzles, but if you advertise it as a story, it needs more plot depth to be "immersive" or feel that I'm saving or helping anyone.","November 20, 2014","true","6.5"," 60 of 68 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","60","68","4","2"

I maintain throughout that you shall doubtlessly be wonderstruck by this land unless the happy-go-lucky temperament of animation features like Up is fiercely disliked.\n\nNote: Played OFFLINE for 3 hrs\nSteam Client displays the added playtime duration offline, only while offline. It is unfortunate that this resets after reconnecting. So my 8 minutes was purposeful idling to add this review of my three hour offline playthrough.\n\nTrusting only the reviews, I bought this game on a whim without much knowledge of what the game was. It is one of those games so darling in its inventions that you'll have to check it yourself to understand the fuss. The art style reminds me of original Pixar sketches and are aesthetically flushed in simple pastels and coloured in complementary contrast tints of green, blue, orange, brown and grey.\n\nUnlike the storyline offered in the description, it didn't seem as if I was saving a planet as everything seemed hunky-dory despite the meteor hit. Instead, as I was still fixing odd broken gadgets here and there, it felt as if I were the new mechanic on Tiny Planet and through my work, the tales of its inhabitants were shown to me in a fabular form. These are tales of life and happy souls which will lighten your spirits from all megrims and entertain with a puzzle variety ranging easy to medium which are all jolly good fun. It has been the most enjoyable hidden object game I've played on Steam as through the course of most of this game you will be searching for a variety of items to fix things and open up new paths and stories.\n\nOther than hidden object puzzles and jigsaws, the puzzles consist of sequential move puzzles using 2D sliding puzzles as well as tiling puzzles, construction puzzles, 8-bit games, memory games and code breaking puzzles. Keeping in mind that is entertaining and soothing for adults, it hasn't any word games and lacks any true challenge that would be too different to progress through for children. It has the medium difficulty crucial for enjoyment from wider audiences so you'll definitely spend time figuring things out but none will take more than a few minutes for mature or experienced puzzlers.\n\nPlease sell me this soundtrack ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっThe Steam Library has a Music menu which seemed pointless to a person who'd never really come across any fantastic gaming soundtracks which felt like proper music and not just good game "BGM". Despite many titles with fun, and at times brilliant soundtracks, it is rare to find one which you hope will essentially own its own album. Even heavenlier than the Hotline Miami series soundtracks, which made me rave a little too, The Tiny Bang Story is the first game to give me goose bumps over listening to the harmonic music in the background of a GAME. It would often be nudged towards the front of the line to relay an enthralling experience which at times lead me away to a distant dreamland, simply stargazing through the splendiferous scores (no pun).\n\nNo loot?!!Spellbinding as I found this game, it was a disappointment to know The Tiny Bang Story omitted  achievements, badges and all that good ol' stuff on Steam. When the art is such a joy, I tend to want "merch" and medallions as souvenirs of my brave(?) journey. In retrospect, I had bucket loads more fun than any odd puzzle game with delirious achievements and roughly sewn badges. So I am  content without any (still a shame it lacks them). As a side effect to ease the transition into focusing solely on the game without "side quests", I had my own achievement creations dinging in my noggin each time I noted something worthy of one happen in-game.\n\nA title you'd automatically want to spread to others is a positive sign of its quality as a game. This is another first for me following the scrumptious soundtrack; The Tiny Bang Story is a game to treat yourself, gift to others and share with those close whenever an opportunity arises.\n","April 4, 2015","true","4.2"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","27","34","0","16"

This a puzzle/adventure game with a few hidden object sequences added in.  The puzzles go from simple to mildly difficult.  Getting stuck is typically not going to happen in this game.

A soccer ball hits the world and turns it into a jigsaw puzzle. There's your story. The ending is even worse.\n\nOf course it has somewhat of an excuse: it's a very casual hidden object game; lots of tiny things to click on, pretty art set at a relatively tiny (but acceptable) box resolution and a tiny amount of options/configuration.\n\nYou're thrown into a scene of half a dozen screens or so and left to click on things for goals to pop up, usually to find X amount of other things to progress or solve a puzzle. There are several areas and maybe 25-30 explorable screens total, not counting puzzle screens. You also find jigsaw pieces throughout and piece some of your world back together on the title screen after each major area.\n\nThere are sliding, jigsaw and pipe puzzles and other minor brainteasers.

Tiny. It's seriously short. No more than 3 hours, and that's being generous, slow and appreciative of the art. Unfortunately, as beautiful the art, music, and puzzles are, it's just nowhere near worth the $10 price. That's about as much as a movie ticket and it lasts about just as long, but one you're done that's it, no big ending of satisfaction, not much of a "story", contrary to the title. That being said, if you think $10 for 2 - 3 hours is worth it, go for it. I'd reccommend waiting for a $5 or less price tag. The puzzles are genuinely challenging at times and is a great, casual pick-up game. 8/10 if on sale.","August 7, 2011","true","3.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I don't understand the appeal and find it frustrating and stupid in general.\nI enjoyed some of the other puzzles in this game, but the couple that are roadblocks to your progress are at odds with how easy the game is in general.\nThe jigsaw section that you play between levels is garbage, as the pieces change colour after being placed, so you can't even match some of them properly.\nThe graphics are quite nice and remind of Samorost a bit, but could use some more click interactions with background objects; like clicking a bell would make it swing and ding.\n\nIf you enjoy pixel hunting games for some reason you may have a better time with this than I did, but I wouldn't recommend it.\nTry Machinarium, Botanicula, or Safecracker: The Ultimate Puzzle Adventure instead, which I actually enjoyed.","December 19, 2015","false","6.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

There are 5 chapthers. IN each chapter you have to colect a number of puzzles which is so adorable because you if you feel stuck there are little bugs  that could be used at hints, you click a number of bugs ( i think 20 ) and you have a yellow bug that gives you a hint. Those puzzles are used at the end of the chapter when you have to restore parts of the planet. At the end of the game you have all the puzzles available at your own pace.\nPROS\nYou have unlimited time to complete the puzzles/game.\nYou have hints.\nIts easy and enjoyable.\nIts not too long and not too short, the exact lenght for this kind of game.\nNice ambiental music.\nAmusing puzzles in game.\nReally nice graphic.\nCONS\nYou cant skip the puzzles.\nThe hints dont give you the 'hints' you want for what task you want, but for a random task.\nNo replay.\nENDING\nThere isnt actually an ending to the game, I mean its very unsatisfying, butfrom mpv the ending is perfect for this type of game, I mean there are chapters and the same ending to all of them ( a puzzle ).\nI recommend this game :3\n","January 3, 2015","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The whimsical and surreal hand-painted backgrounds are reminiscent of a children's story book, of games such as "Machinarium," or of animated shorts such as "La Maison en Petits Cubes."  I'm not ashamed to say I purchased this game solely for the art, and it did not disappoint.\n\nThe gameplay consists of a handful of short hidden object levels.  The items you need to find are sneaky: they blend into the background or are hidden in secret compartments, although if you look hard enough you will find all of them eventually.  It felt more like a scavenger hunt than like traditional "stuff-piled-on-other-stuff" HOGs.  The objects you collect can be used to open up new areas, solve puzzles, or unlock mini-games.\n\nSome of the mini-games were easy and straightforward, but I found many of the rest to be quite frustrating.  They require a wide range of skills including superior spacial perception, logic, patience, memory, fast reflexes, luck, keen observation and attention to detail.  Occasionally the built-in hints were helpful, but often they just reiterated information you already knew instead of nudging you toward the next step.  I feel the game did a great job of making the ultimate goal of each puzzle clear with minimal instructions, but I either had physical trouble doing what they asked, as was the case with the "classic console" sections, or I felt like my brain was spinning in circles trying to get pieces to line up properly, as was the case with the "compass" and "globe map" puzzles.\n\nOne thing I noticed that may be an issue for some players is the game's heavy reliance on colour-coded puzzles.  If you are colourblind you WILL NOT be able to beat this game without using a walkthrough.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 7.5/10.

The objects you collect can be used to open up new areas, solve puzzles, or unlock mini-games.\n\nSome of the mini-games were easy and straightforward, but I found many of the rest to be quite frustrating.  They require a wide range of skills including superior spacial perception, logic, patience, memory, fast reflexes, luck, keen observation and attention to detail.  Occasionally the built-in hints were helpful, but often they just reiterated information you already knew instead of nudging you toward the next step.  I feel the game did a great job of making the ultimate goal of each puzzle clear with minimal instructions, but I either had physical trouble doing what they asked, as was the case with the "classic console" sections, or I felt like my brain was spinning in circles trying to get pieces to line up properly, as was the case with the "compass" and "globe map" puzzles.\n\nOne thing I noticed that may be an issue for some players is the game's heavy reliance on colour-coded puzzles.  If you are colourblind you WILL NOT be able to beat this game without using a walkthrough.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 7.5/10.  It is short, but meaty and innovative, and is worth picking up just for the art alone.","August 19, 2014","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sadly the soundtrack is missing here on steam. I think for the normal retail price of 4,99 € the soundtrack should really be within the package.\n\nSo I recommend you to get this game on discount.

It felt endearing and unexpectedly satisfying to jigsaw puzzle a broken planet back together again, section by section.

You are put in an area and your goal is to find different things to advance further, all the while searching for puzzle pieces and completing small puzzle games. At the end of every level, you can put all of the puzzle pieces you found through-out the world and add them to the giant puzzle of the world. There is a hint system if you get stuck, though I found that it isn't always the most helpful. After you beat the game, you can replay any of the puzzle games that you had played throughout your adventure. I didn't personally think it was worth replaying any of them, but a person who is interested in puzzle games might want to do that. Overall I think that if you are a casual gamer or you enjoy puzzle games, you should definately buy this, and if you don't enjoy puzzles or search-and-finds you might want to reconsider, but keep in mind that I bought this with a 90% off coupon, so if you don't want to spend a lot of money on this game, then I would look for one of those coupons.","March 30, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I bought it for just $10 pesos (like $0.99 dollars or even less).\n\nI expected it to be very simple and boring, basically a broken game coded in one day or so. I could not be more wrong.\n\nHere, the flaws of the game:\n\n- It doesn't support high resolutions. At least in my machine, it can run only on 1024x768, even on fullscreen.\n\nHere, the good things about the game:\n\n- Very good music. Is very relaxing. I loved the main title music, is just... good, soft, I can't describe it.\n\n- Well made puzzles. Some of the puzzles presented are easy, even trivial, but others (like the Worl Map or the Tetris Like pieces)... oh boy, they are complex, even when you know what you need to do. A couple of puzzles, I think, need more explanation to really know what you are supposed to do, but they are still very good.\n\n- Pieces very well hidden. You need to find puzzle pieces. To do it, you need to solve some problems. To solve the problems, you need to find other pieces. To find other pieces, you need to solve other problems. A very interesting way to play, I think.\n\n- Makes you think about your actions. Mostly at the two last levels, I learned, the hard way, that you need to first search for all the puzzle pieces that you can fin *before* completing a problem, because the problem for which you already have the needed pieces might be the las problem to solve and you will be transported to the next level, even when you have not found the remaining puzzle pieces yet.\n\nI truly recommend this game. If you can afford the game, have time to spend, like to think about problems and have a big screen (to compensate the more or less low resolution), then, you need to buy it.","February 8, 2015","true","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedimono/recommended/96000/","thedimono","DiMono","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedimono/","207 products in account","The bulk of Tiny Bang Story is a hidden objects game. You start out searching for jigsaw puzzle pieces, and as you interact with things you are informed of other things you need to find in order to access puzzles. When you complete enough puzzles on the few screens for each level, you are taken to the world screen to place the jigsaw pieces. There are five levels, and 25 puzzles.\n\nThe art direction for this game is fantastic, and the music, while repetitive, is rather soothing. This is definitely a game to play for relaxation and puzzle solving; there is no hardcore setting in Tiny Bang Story. There's also no story once you start playing. I streamed the game expecting something engaging, and did not get that.\n\nGameplayThe hidden objects portion of the game is tedious, but there are little blue flies you can click on to fill up your hint ball. Once the hint ball is full, you can click on it to send a red hint fly around the screen to orbit an item you haven't yet clicked on. If there are no such items on that screen, nothing happens, and you know you haven't missed anything on that screen.\n\nMost of the actual puzzles are fairly rudimentary, and are things you've seen before. There are a couple that are very good though, most notably the water pipe puzzle in the last level. It is absolutely possible to solve it from scratch, and it is easily the most challenging puzzle in the game.\n\nThe worst puzzle is the astrolabe puzzle in level 3, which isn't a puzzle at all: you just rotate the thing until the lines all line up. Level 2 has what's basically a Simon machine, which is also not really a puzzle, and there are a handful of minigames scattered throughout as well.\n\nOne thing worth noting is that it doesn't actually matter whether you collect all the jigsaw puzzle pieces, as you will always have the correct amount upon completing a level. Also, three spoilers that will make your game a lot easier: the wheel for the train is in the example diagram, both clear flasks in level 2 are downstairs, and you must rotate the astrolabe counter-clockwise in order to finish it quickly.\n\nI finished it in 4 hours, and a fair portion of that was on level 1 while I was still getting used to the game mechanics. There's also no replay value, especially considering what the ending is. I give it a 6.5/10, and I'd say it's worth playing if you can get it on sale.","January 3, 2015","true","4.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The short length may not keep you occupied for more then a few hours, but that will be one of the most wonderful few hours you spend in front of your monitor.\n\nLong version:\nThe Tiny Bang Story is a short and sweet hidden object puzzle game. Since these kind of games are a dime a dozen, it’s hard to stand out among them, and luckily Tiny Bang Story knew exactly how to do it: with its style. All scenes feature gorgeous hand-drawn graphics which also help hiding the various collectible objects, since they blend in even more than in some other hidden object games.\n\nApart from the visual style the game is aiming for an interesting artistic goal: not a single word is spoken, nor there is any kind of writing, anywhere, apart from the mandatory main menu. Everything is told by visuals, which is always a great challenge for any artist, and the game achieves this flawlessly.\nThis also makes the game perfectly suitable for little children, which is also supplemented by the modern (somewhat steampunk-like) fairy tale theme and the soothing music. It’s not a child’s game per se as it’s more than enjoyable for adults too, but it may also serve as a really good tool to help the cognitive development of the little ones.\n\nThe negatives? The game’s puzzles are set, so replay value is fairly low. Also, the game is quite short, shorter than some Big Fish Games hidden puzzles, clocking around 2-4 hours. And the downside of the hand-drawn graphics is that the game has only one resolution (naturally it supports full screen and windowed modes).","August 8, 2014","true","5.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Each chapter ends with you literally putting the tiny world back together with twenty-five (!) puzzle pieces painstakingly found in the last world. Unfortunately a good third of the jigsaw is lightly cloudy or starry space, which makes many of the sky pieces nearly identical to a glance.\nThere's a built-in puzzle-spotter, which is obnoxious. To charge it for a single activation, you have to click thirty (30!) small, flying insects, which is simply punitive. There are also 'solutions' available for each puzzle, but be aware that many are reversed, incomplete, or actually wrong.\nThe game has maybe two hours worth of play.

The good things it has going for it are that the soundtrack is good, the hidden object gameplay is relaxing and satisfying, and the art is absolutely amazing. The art is very reminiscent of Amanita Design (e.g. Samarost, Machinarium).\n\nOne important thing to note about Tiny Bang Story that will make it or break it for you, though, is that the hidden object gameplay is periodically broken up by actual puzzles you have to solve or mini-arcade games where you have to navigate a pixel boat or airplane through some pixel trees and rocks, etc. These little puzzles and mini-games add more flavor and variety to the game, so on one hand they are welcome. On the other hand, the little atari-style mini games are not very fun, and they go on for what seems like an excessively long time, and if you make one mistake, you have to start the whole tedious thing over again. The puzzles are usually of the jigsaw or tangram variety, but there are some permutation or mathematical puzzles in there as well. At first these are very light and easy, but by the time you make it to the third or fourth area of the world, they suddenly become way more demanding and can be very cumbersome (I especially disliked the puzzle where you have to balance the luggage on the scales). This is especially true if you are primarily interested in the hidden object gameplay. You may find yourself wanting to just look up the solution so you can get back to searching for hidden objects and avoid being obstructed by these.\n\nThe game also has a hint system, which you can activate by swatting a bunch of flies until you fill up a hint meter, but in my experience, there were 2 or 3 situations where I pressed the hint button and it either did not give any hint at all (literally did nothing) or it gave me an absolutely useless hint, essentially telling me what my objective is or some other such information I already know.\n\nOverall it seems like a pretty good game. I enjoyed the art and music, and I enjoyed how relaxing and warm it is. I personally felt the puzzles and mini-games got to be too cumbersome after a certain point, so I've lost my interest in finishing it, but it will be a very good game for the right kind of person.","June 20, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's pretty exclusively a hidden-object type game with a few minigames/puzzles for a bit of variety, but really they're minor. Nothing here's really too difficult nor too easy but it probably makes for a decent kid's game I'd expect, what with the vibrant colors and art style, as well as some soothing music. There's a few of the minigames that are stupid/boring/tedious (two of them, to be precise) and a few others that I guess are decent puzzles but boil down to trial and error for most of us. There's also no story to speak of, it's pretty much pure gameplay. I suppose there's not a lot to dislike here necessarily but there's realy not a lot here to begin with, either.

It has an amazing art style. The graphics are great and the find and click puzzles are a pure joy because of it.\n\nIt also has a variety of other puzzles throughout the game that challenge different mental attributes. Thus will be more or less challenging depending on who you are.\n\nThe game has no guide, no tutorial, nothing, you are just tossed into this beautiful world and only told to find puzzle pieces. From there the adventure expands rapidly.\n\nThe game is 2 hours long.

Mind challenging puzzles, objects for you to collect (point&click style) and puzzle assembling. The background story dictates that the world is hit by an asteroid and your mission is to assemble it back to the paradise it was before. The soundtrack is really enjoyable and the hint system is actually clever (minus the annoying buzzing sounds). Overall, I recommend The Tiny Bang Story as it is a clever little game that will entertain you for some time.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=442117878","April 6, 2015","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It first charmed me with its pretty graphics, enjoyable music, summing up to a cute atosphere alltogether. The first level was in fact fun to play, however as I progressed into the game, I grew more and more frustrated and found myself thinking, "Is the game challenging, or am I just challenged?".\n\nThe game is based on three elements:\n\n1. Finding hidden items that help you get to proper puzzles.  You do have to be very observant to find the clues. What I found annoying was that you cannot collect all of the items beforehand, only upon discovering a puzzle that requires certain things to work.\n2. Proper puzzles/minigames.  Some are genuinely interesting and fun to play, although the code to cracking them could be discovered in another way than just clicking the help button. But beware the flickin' arcade games with horrible controls (after all, it's a point and click game!)\n3. Putting puzzle pieces together.  Boring and frustrating, with all the pieces having the same shape.\n\nThe game gets rather dull when you are forced to repeat exactly the same actions all over again with little varation between them. It is also easy to get frustrated while searching for objects, and the clue system can get annoying too.\n\nI imagine it could be better to play the game on the tablet than a computer. I'm definately glad I bought it on sale, because the PC gameplay is rather nightmare-ish.","February 27, 2015","false","2.8"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","16","34","3","0"

There are three basic aspects to this game; a jigsaw puzzel, hidden objects, and a number of puzzle games.\n\nBasically, you find hidden objects to unlock various puzzle games which unlock more areas for you to finish collecting the hidden objects you need to pass the level. The various puzzle games aren't bad, and in fact some of them are pretty good; however I still had a number of issues with the game play.\n\nThere are two types of hidden objects. Pieces to the jigsaw puzzle that you work on between levels and objects required to unlock the puzzle games or additional areas within a level. Finding the puzzle pieces can present a nice challenge, but the objects related to the mini games are beyond easy to find. The problem with this is that the puzzle peices are completely unnecessary. Whether you find one or all 25, you are given every piece from that level when working on the jigsaw puzzle between rounds. The game doesn't even keep track of how many pieces you have missed nor does missing pieces create gaps in the jigsaw puzzle, which would not only add to the challenge but also give the player some motivation to find all of the puzzle pieces. I also had issues with the jigsaw itself. Basically, every piece of the puzzle was identical in shape and all you had to do was assemble the pieces on top of a to-scale photo of the puzzle. Even the sky/background pieces offered no challenge what-so-ever.\n\nI also found the lack of direction in this game to be a bit of a problem. The description states that there is no text, but there isn't even the tiniest bit of instruction when beginning a mini-game without clicking on the 'hint'. Playing through a second time, I've noticed that some of the hints are simply instructions for the game, while others are actual hints (Which I wanted to avoid using). This was a problem because at the beginning of each game, I found myself clicking around the puzzle a few times in order to see how the controls worked, and on at least two occasions my random clicking actually solved the puzzle before I even had a chance to actually begin. This lack of instruction also meant that the greatest challenge for some puzzles was actually figuring out what you needed to do as opposed to trying to solve the puzzle. Again, there were at least three or four puzzles that were both challenging and fullfilling.\n\nThe ending is beyond unfulfilling. After reaching the final screen, there is no "the end", "you won", "congradulations", nothing. You have an oppertunity to replay any of the mini puzzzles that you faced throughout the game, and after collecting enough bugs for a 'hint', the game indicated that I needed to play them. I only did so thinking that this was one final challenge before beating the game. I was wrong.\n\nAfter beating the mini-puzzles a second time, I started a second game since I had missed a few of the puzzle pieces the first time around. I would have kept looking for them, but if you click on the last object of the level you are forced to move on even if you haven't found all of the puzzle pieces. I was hoping that finding all of the puzzle pieces would earn me some sort of ending. I was wrong. One play through lasts 90-120 minutes which actually makes this the most expensive game playtime/$ of any that I have ever bought on Steam; even after counting the second playthrough etc. I only got 4hours from the game, the rest was just runtime while I was away from the computer.\n\nWhat really prevents me from recommending this game is the description. The store page talks about putting the tiny planet back together and helping the inhabitants etc., but there is no story in this game. Putting the planet back together involves the jigsaw puzzle which was unfulfilling at best, and helping the inhabitants means that there is a person somewhere on each level. Clicking on the person reveals their desire (that you solve a certain minigame) before they'll give you a key or one of the hidden objects you seek, but never once did I feel like I was helping them or even that they had any sort of personality whatsoever.\n\n\nUltimately this game was unfinished. What starts out as a cute puzzle game quickly turns boring and repetitive in less than an hour. Also, considering the amount of content, this game is grossly overpriced even at $1USD.\n\n2/10","October 16, 2014","false","5.6"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","0"

Point-and-click, hidden object, casual. Visuals are pretty, music is soothing, but there is little reward in finishing this game. Each one had a very vague hint and some didn't make any sense - leaving me a bit frustrated. If you don't get all the puzzle pieces per stage, they give them to you anyway. I did like that you put the pieces to the jigsaw after each bit. Would have liked it to be longer, have more story, achievements, punishment/reward for getting all the things, and a way to get more hints per puzzle.\n\nEdit: Played the game a second time through only because of cards. The frustration and anger is the same in 2016, but turning the sound off helps (mosquitos bzzt pitch really got to me). Clicking the mosquitos only trickle the hint meter and each have a small click box as they move around. And even though the puzzle pieces collected in each zone mean nothing, the mosquito hints will tend go to puzzle piece instead of an actual hint to find other objects. Another thing is that the foreground and background still like to merge which isn't helpful. I mean even if you're into hidden object games, it'll save you the stress to pick something else.","April 18, 2014","false","7.3"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","9","20","0","4"

Quickly though, the shiny aesthetic wears off to reveal a disappointing core game. The first level feels like it had by far the most effort put into it-perhaps to entice people with a nice demo?\n\nThe gameplay is roughly a 50/50 split between Where's Waldo-esque collection quests and simple logic puzzles. The logic puzzles range from decent to mediocre, with the mediocre ones lacking any way of achieving a solution other than brute force guessing or using a guide. One problem is that it is sometimes unclear what the player has achieved in the world by completing a puzzle. Several times I found myself looking around, trying to figure what had changed in the world as a result of finishing a puzzle. This greatly diminished the satisfaction of completing the puzzle.\n\nThe game's biggest flaw, though, lies in its lack of respect for its own premise. The game is divided into five levels, each containing 25 puzzle pieces that, ostensibly, you are supposed to collect in order to repiar the fractured world. On the third level, I neglected to collect several of the puzzle pieces before activating the end-of-level sequence. I was dismayed to discover that not only was there no way to return to the level to collect the rest of the pieces, but the game had progressed as if I had collected them all anyway. This was quite disappointing considering that collecting these pieces has been presented in the opening as the main goal of the game.\n\nDue to this severe problem, combined with the lack of an ending and rampant use of the filler collection quests in a pretty short game, I cannot recommend The Tiny Bang Story. I think you can do a lot better in the adventure genre.","March 12, 2014","false","11.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

To unlock every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzle it's required to search for things, so you're just sitting there, clicking on everything on the screen for 1 hour untill you unlock that puzzle. Most of those puzzles are so simple that you can complete them in 2-3 minutes. Some are boring and long, the other ones doesn't even make any sense. I like it when there's a point of completing a puzzle. Like, when there IS some reward for it, but no, after every puzzle you're back to mindless and boring pixel hunting, it's not fun knowing that you are going to do it for the whole game long. Sure, art is great, but that never makes a good game. Some people also compare this little game to indies like "Machinarium", "Samorost" etc. But belive me, it's NOTHING compared to those games. There is no story, there is no point. Simple puzzles and pixel hunting, that's it. Sure, this game is good for children, casual gamers or people who just want to spend some spare minutes on something simple. But not for people who are looking for a good, decent point and click. 5/10 Should have stayed as a mobile game. The tiny bang theory: -Hey sheldor, r my boobz big enuf? -I'm not in mood for pixel hunting, peney.

If you get stuck and need a hint (and you probably will), you have to stop what you're doing and click on these flies that buzz in from offscreen. It takes a good minute or two to fill up the hint meter, and when you need another hint you have to repeat the process. It would have been better if the meter gradually filled on its own, or if items collected gave you some meter. But if you try to use the hint and the object you need isn't visible on the screen (hidden behind a door), the hint won't activate. It's useful for not wasting hints on screens where there are no items, but I got stuck when the item I needed was behind a window that had to be opened by clicking on a tiny lever half the screen away. No hints for that, just frustrated spam-clicking.\nAfter that, there's the puzzles. Most of them are super easy: some even tell you the answer in the hint. But lots of them rely on color recognition, a big no-no in game design. There are no options for color-blindness.\nFinally, scattered throughout each chapter are puzzle pieces which are used to rebuild the world. But you don't actually need to collect all of the pieces to finish a level, or even the game. I was missing two pieces on the final level, and it just ended. Then I suddenly had all of them to finish the big puzzle. Then the game just ended. Just like that. There was no fanfare, no "You did it!" The game just ended and you get to replay puzzles.\nThe game has its good points, but overall I was disappointed. A good timekiller, but not a well-made one.","December 24, 2014","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't want to spoil it, so keep your eyes peeled or cheat and check a walkthrough of this game to figure out the hidden storyline within the game!\nThe music was soothing and relaxing, which is best suited for a laid-back casual game like this.\n\nCONS/BUGS:\n\nThe window containing the list of things you should look for should have been toggleable. A number of times I had to wait for it to close so I could pick up the items on that list.\nUseless Hint Orb: From what I'm assuming, the little bug creature syou collect fill an orb on the top right of the player's screen. Filling it up, I supposed, would then reward the player with a helpful tip or hint in getting through the stage with everything found. Well....thing is, when I tried to use it, the thing never worked. I may have sacrificed plenty of bugs to that hint bubble and nothing happened.\nThere is a bug in the end of the final chapter where I found the second to last piece of my puzzle collection behind the hummingbird clock. I would have gone to try and locate the last one, but before I could, the game automatically took me back to the title screen to put the pieces in place. Not sure if a bug, or it was just my computer.\nI feel doing the tasks handed to us in the game should be accompanied with a litle hint or a normal short notification to the player on what they should be doing in the game at the moment.\n\nOVERALL\nThe game is as its tag says; casual, indie, and its a puzzle.

I'd rate it above average for anyone who's nostalgic for that windows 95 search and click puzzle experience.  That art is superb, the music is soothing, and the the puzzles are enough to entertain you for a bit.\n\nHowever, you will get stuck and a few of the puzzles just don't have good explanations or hints on what to do.  Also the character you're searching is a disappointing lardo you'd want to avoid in real life if you're biased against fat people.  If you're not, he's just a disappointing hardworking entrepreneur that doesn't really give you a satisfying ending.","December 25, 2014","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cool graphics, nice price, and a reasonable challenge. There are some Rubik's Cube-type puzzles in this one, and I am terrible with that type of thing, so for me there are some very difficult sections. Also, for the most part, using hints is not terribly helpful, and even when it is, replenishing the hint meter involves a slightly aggravating task, and thereby inflicts a penalty. Recommended if you like HOGs or PNCs.  [ 7 / 10 ]","August 30, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, the puzzle pieces are a nice bonus puzzle, however, upon completing the game, I managed to complete the world puzzle. Even though I had missed three puzzle pieces during my gameplay.

There is no avatar, it's just you, the mouse pointer. Also, you don't exactly solve an adventure as much as you carefully look for items across various rooms. Imagine a MMOAdventureGame. Instead of finding X item once, you have to find it 10 times but it's far easier to find and you can get hints by clicking on flies.\n\nPuzzles are fairly standard. Tetris puzzle, pieces in painting puzzle, jigsaw puzzle, pipe puzzle etc.\n\nWithout a walkthrough (and i suck at adventure games) finished it in about 5 hours which, let's be honest here, is a little weak for this kind of title. Given it's price, however, you can't hold the length too much against it.\n\nThink of it more like a puzzle game than an adventure game and you'll love it.

The art is very pretty and the puzzles had a lot of variety; my only quibble is that there is not a skip option for puzzles.  For someone like me, who likes certain types of puzzles and completely abhors others, it's grating to have to struggle through the irritating ones.\n\nThe bulk of the game, aside from the minigame puzzles, is "hidden-object" style with a set number of puzzle pieces in each level, along with a variety of other objects to find to complete objectives (i.e. finding all the mail packages to load on a plane before you can take off).  The hidden items are legitimately challenging; the puzzle pieces especially blend in very well to the backdrop and that's a refreshing change from the typical "here's a pile of junk, find stuff in it" style of HO games.\n\nWith the length of the game, I'm not sure if it's worth the full price, but I did find it enjoyable.  If you like HO games and puzzlers, you'll probably like this one; you'll have to decide whether or not to wait for a sale!","January 27, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't want to spoil it, so keep your eyes peeled or cheat and check a walkthrough of this game to figure out the hidden storyline within the game!\nThe music was soothing and relaxing, which is best suited for a laid-back casual game like this.\n\nCONS/BUGS:\n\nThe window containing the list of things you should look for should have been toggleable. A number of times I had to wait for it to close so I could pick up the items on that list.\nUseless Hint Orb: From what I'm assuming, the little bug creature syou collect fill an orb on the top right of the player's screen. Filling it up, I supposed, would then reward the player with a helpful tip or hint in getting through the stage with everything found. Well....thing is, when I tried to use it, the thing never worked. I may have sacrificed plenty of bugs to that hint bubble and nothing happened.\nThere is a bug in the end of the final chapter where I found the second to last piece of my puzzle collection behind the hummingbird clock. I would have gone to try and locate the last one, but before I could, the game automatically took me back to the title screen to put the pieces in place. Not sure if a bug, or it was just my computer.\nI feel doing the tasks handed to us in the game should be accompanied with a litle hint or a normal short notification to the player on what they should be doing in the game at the moment.\n\nOVERALL\nThe game is as its tag says; casual, indie, and its a puzzle. A dang awesome puzzle game with complimenting music and art.\n\nI would give this game a 80/100 stars! Definitely a play for fun and relaxation!\n\n","November 21, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelastreturn/recommended/96000/","thelastreturn","Thelastreturn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelastreturn/","237 products in account","The Tiny Bang story is a relaxing find-and-puzzle game, the graphical style, the music and the overal gameplay are very peaceful and cozy, although the game succeeds in frustrating the player in many of the unskippable minigames.\nGameplay:\nThe main gameplay element is finding items hidden within the scenary, items like lightbulbs, vents, puzzelpieces... Because these items are in most cases really well blended with the environment there is a help system, click enough mosquitoes  and they will show you where 1 hidden items is within the scene. This is a nice little help system because they force the player to look at the scene while trying to catch them, often finding the hidden item before actually using the clue. They also hold the player back from using hints all the time, because you need quite alot of them for one clue instead of filling over time like most help systems in game do.\n\nMinigames:\nThere are quite alot of minigames within this game, 20 to be exact. Most of them are very relaxing and don't require any help, but there are a few ennoying ones where you really have to try and try to eventually solve them. These minigames never have any hints except for a paper with a drawing on it trying to explain what you have to do without using any text, and for most of them that is enough. But it would be nice to get a little bit of extra help on the difficult puzzels.\n\nStory:\nAlthough there is no player character and thus no real story, you do learn alot about the world and it's inhabitants through it's scenary.\n\nGraphics:\nAs you can see in the screenshots of the game, the graphics consist of a very stylisch 2D side view of the world. The graphics are well done and are very fitting for the game and atmostphere.\n\nSound:\nThe background music is relaxing and suited the game well. Though the soundeffects of the mosquitoes did ennoy me after some while. There are no dialogues in the game, so I can't say anything about voice overs.\n\nConclusion:\nThough it's a very short game to play through, it's definitely worth playing if you like more relaxing and calm puzzle games. It's a nice change of pace between all the other games, and a real candy for the eye. So I recommend it to anyone who can enjoy a more relaxing puzzle game.","January 4, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has nice art and atmosphere, but it's just not fun.\nThe game basically feels like a tedious process of desperately trying to find what you need to click on, followed by all-too-brief moments of actual puzzles.\n\nThe "quests" are started by clicking on something in the environment (indicated on mouse-over), followed by collecting a bunch of needed pieces to activate the associated puzzle.  The pieces in the environment are not uniform in size or appearance, and there is no visual indication to differentiate a clickable piece from a static piece of the background.  The pieces are often very small, and frequently seem deliberately designed to blend into the background or feel like an unremovable part of another object.  When coupled with the fact that there is no visual indication, and some things that look like the pieces *aren't*, it becomes more frustrating than fun to find these pieces.\n\nThere is a help system, which involves collecting mosquitoes to "charge up" for use.  You do this by (surprise?) clicking the mosquitoes.  The help seemed almost useless, with nothing happening often times when clicked - as if you weren't on the right screen for the help to assist, nothing would happen.  I also clicked it once and then clicked an item, resulting in the collected "charge" being lost, with no help given...commence more mindless clicking.\n\nThe level design also frequently means that if you haven't started a "quest", you can't get the associated items even if you are staring right at them, meaning once you are able to get the quest you have to go back through all the screens you had already visited collecting the items you'd seen but couldn't previously get.\n\nMy final gripe is with the actual puzzles where you had to solve jigsaws / place items in their correct spots.  It was incredibly picky about the pieces being aligned near perfectly, and - in at least one of the puzzles - the pieces would fly back to their original location if not placed properly.  In one of these puzzles, pieces also seemed deliberately hidden in the environment.\n\nBasically, this game is less about solving proper puzzles and more about testing your vision looking for tiny, obscured, clickable things.","May 3, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What drew me in initially was the visual style. Every level has an uncanny level of detail, making the experience very pleasing to the eye. Gameplay involves travelling from room to room, solving simple puzzles and searching for puzzle pieces along the way to complete a virtual puzzle that advances you to the next world. It's a simple formula, and probably would start to get boring if the game were any longer, but it works and is engaging while it lasts.\n\nThere were definitely a couple of downfalls. There were a couple puzzle pieces in levels that were simply impossible for me to find. After long periods of searching every inch of the level, there were instances where I was forced to look up tutorials on YouTube, which really took me out of the experience. Most likely you will experience this once or twice, and maybe you will be more perceverent than I was and succeed, but it will still be frustrating nonetheless. Also, there is no reason to play this game a second time, for you will know the location of the puzzle pieces. There are a couple of minigames that become available upon completion of the main story, but those are only a minor distration.\n\nIf you're looking for a super casual game that's accessible and pretty to look at, this is definitely your cup of tea.","August 17, 2012","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

They are entirely unlike the other puzzles in the game which are more cerebral and less... stupid. I wish they could be skipped. That being said there are only two of them, but they almost made me give up on the game.\n\nTwo, the transition between stages is really really bad. You have to collect all these puzzle pieces, and I was going to commend the game for designing it so that I had actually already found all the puzzle pieces before I completed the level and didn't need to spend time scouring for them (there's enough of that in the game anyway) but it turns out you don't actually need to find them all; for the 3rd stage I progressed without having all the puzzle pieces.\n\nEither way, you have to do this jigsaw of the world between stages, and it's frankly, awful filler. Jigsaw games exist, and I wnjoy them, but what sets this one apart and brings it to a transendant level of awfulness is that maybe 20% of the pieces are sky, and while that's fine, sky has some texture to it... nope, the puzzle pieces are rendered with bloom on them that makes it impossible to read any subtle indicators.\n\nTo make the complaints of the transitions sucking a triqueta, I should also point out that the game locks up for a few seconds between stages, making me worried it will crash before I can put the puzzle pieces together.\n\nI quite literally got a headache playing this, but for this kind of game that's quite ordinary, and like all games of this kind you need a walk through open in the background, but I found I only refered to it a few times for the more obnoxious puzzles and teeny tiny collectables. Y'know, to get the game finished in one sitting without my head exploding. I neededn't have worried so much, because it actually saves mid-level, but this isn't advertised anywhere, so I assumed that, like a lot of games of this genre, it didn't, and I was always too caught up in it all to test.\n\nThe ending is deeply unsatisfying, OR it glitched and I missed it. No explanation was given about who the sinister chubby blonde kid is, apart from "probably a toff".","June 16, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In reality, it's not.  Yes.  There are teeny tiny little objects to be found throughout the game.  But, that's not what a HOG is.  It's not really that important since other things swamp my rating.  But, it's something to be aware of.  The big thing that hurts the game is that nothing (absolutely nothing) is explained.  We're dumped into a setting with no idea what we're supposed to do, how to do it, or why.  The next biggest issues is somewhat related:  once we figure out what we're doing, we get into mini-puzzles.  But, once again, we're given no idea what to do with them.  Most of them can be figured out with the hint they give us.  But, some of them remain entirely opaque (I finished several by blindly flailing around with the mouse and never understood what I'd done to "succeed").  Next, as we move around the screen looking for those hidden objects or the secret areas they might be in, the cursor doesn't change to indicate any "hot" zones.  Basically, the game turns into a click-fest because we have to click on every single thing we see in case it's important.  And finally, the puzzles and objects aren't necessarily "necessary" to the game.  In the second area, I skipped a puzzle so I could come back to it later.  I ended up brute-forcing another puzzle which, I think, the puzzle I skipped was supposed to open.  The game happily let me do this and leave the area without ever finishing that puzzle.  In the third area, I finished the last puzzle before gathering the last hidden puzzle piece.  When I placed the object from that last puzzle where it belonged, the game happily moved me from the area and gave me all the puzzle pieces I needed for the world-puzzle.\n\nI got 4.0 hours of game-play out of this.  So, the list price is a bit high purely from a dollar-per-hour aspect.  But, even if the game were much cheaper (heck, I paid 50 cents for it), the issues I noted above just put the game into the Not-Recommended area.","November 1, 2015","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's no story per se, even if the store page tells about how the Tiny Planet has been smashed into pieces and you have to fix it. I don't see how that's incorporated into the game in any other way than the pieces of puzzle you find throughout the different chapters (and then put them together when finishing a chapter).\n\nSome of the puzzles are not easy to solve - not because they're difficult in understanding, but because you either don't understand completely what you're supposed to do or the puzzle itself is extremely sensitive to your mouse's movement (only applies to one puzzle).\n\n+\nVery beautiful art\n\nNeat music, it's hypnotizing and relaxing\n\nEasy and fun, well worth spending an afternoon with\n\nYou really have to scout the screen in order to find every piece you're looking for, and yes, I say that on the plus side. This game deserves not being rushed through, but investigated thoroughly.\n\n-\nSome might find the 8-bits mini games inside the game itself stressful, however they aren't hard but rahter reminds me of the whole "You only have 1 life to play through the entire game" mentality that was applied to early NES games\n\nNo story other than what you imagine yourself, and that might be a downside for some. I like it though.\n\nIt's rather short, but I still think it's worth the money\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yeah, if you like point-and-click games with harmless music and don't mind a bit of trial-and-error in order to solve some of the puzzles. I find myself returning to the game when in need of some relaxation or when in a need of cheering up. It's neat and only makes you feel happy when playing it, and that's not a bad thing.","March 20, 2015","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They are entirely unlike the other puzzles in the game which are more cerebral and less... stupid. I wish they could be skipped. That being said there are only two of them, but they almost made me give up on the game.\n\nTwo, the transition between stages is really really bad. You have to collect all these puzzle pieces, and I was going to commend the game for designing it so that I had actually already found all the puzzle pieces before I completed the level and didn't need to spend time scouring for them (there's enough of that in the game anyway) but it turns out you don't actually need to find them all; for the 3rd stage I progressed without having all the puzzle pieces.\n\nEither way, you have to do this jigsaw of the world between stages, and it's frankly, awful filler. Jigsaw games exist, and I wnjoy them, but what sets this one apart and brings it to a transendant level of awfulness is that maybe 20% of the pieces are sky, and while that's fine, sky has some texture to it... nope, the puzzle pieces are rendered with bloom on them that makes it impossible to read any subtle indicators.\n\nTo make the complaints of the transitions sucking a triqueta, I should also point out that the game locks up for a few seconds between stages, making me worried it will crash before I can put the puzzle pieces together.\n\nI quite literally got a headache playing this, but for this kind of game that's quite ordinary, and like all games of this kind you need a walk through open in the background, but I found I only refered to it a few times for the more obnoxious puzzles and teeny tiny collectables. Y'know, to get the game finished in one sitting without my head exploding. I neededn't have worried so much, because it actually saves mid-level, but this isn't advertised anywhere, so I assumed that, like a lot of games of this genre, it didn't, and I was always too caught up in it all to test.\n\nThe ending is deeply unsatisfying, OR it glitched and I missed it. No explanation was given about who the sinister chubby blonde kid is, apart from "probably a toff".","June 16, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What drew me in initially was the visual style. Every level has an uncanny level of detail, making the experience very pleasing to the eye. Gameplay involves travelling from room to room, solving simple puzzles and searching for puzzle pieces along the way to complete a virtual puzzle that advances you to the next world. It's a simple formula, and probably would start to get boring if the game were any longer, but it works and is engaging while it lasts.\n\nThere were definitely a couple of downfalls. There were a couple puzzle pieces in levels that were simply impossible for me to find. After long periods of searching every inch of the level, there were instances where I was forced to look up tutorials on YouTube, which really took me out of the experience. Most likely you will experience this once or twice, and maybe you will be more perceverent than I was and succeed, but it will still be frustrating nonetheless. Also, there is no reason to play this game a second time, for you will know the location of the puzzle pieces. There are a couple of minigames that become available upon completion of the main story, but those are only a minor distration.\n\nIf you're looking for a super casual game that's accessible and pretty to look at, this is definitely your cup of tea.","August 17, 2012","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

From the music to the charming little puzzles interspersed throughout, you'll find much more than a time waster on your hands.\n\nWith no conventional story to be had, the whole plot basically revolves around collecting the puzzle pieces that make up the world. You'll encounter an individual character in each area, and you'll see a broad narrative of a young boy's adventures as you go, but it's mainly background. Everything in this game is hidden in plain site, but a keen eye can spot the majority of the items often before you even need to pick them up. This is all bundled in an absolutely gorgeous art style that makes use of pastels to give an authentic painting look. Every puzzle has its own twist, and there was only one puzzle out of the dozens I encountered that seemed to not follow any discernable logic. Some of the puzzles you encounter are often more mini-games than anything, from a simon-says challenge to some challenges that look like they came straight from a Commodore 64. Variety isn't something I was expecting with this, but by god is there a lot.\n\nThe only hiccups in design is that once you leave an area, you can't return. Not that I found anyway. The early areas indicate the ending through obvious cues, but some of the last areas aren't as obvious, and it led to me leaving behind a few as yet unfound puzzle pieces (I think 3 in all). Curiously, I was still able to put the world back together without a single piece left out so it's not a big deal, but my OCD aches that I couldn't get the other pieces. That, and the hint system is nearly worthless, and kind of a pain in the butt to charge. You have to collect dozens of bugs for one use, and no matter if it's charged or not they still litter the screen. You won't need the hint system generally though, so it's all minor gripes, but a desire to turn off the bug hints was rather high for me.\n\nThere are few games that can put me at piece as easily as this one did, and it served as a wonderful sleepaid after work and the like. For something a little different that harkens back to the Pajama Sam days but with a sense of grace to it, it's really a genuinely pleasant experience, and that is hard to come by these days. Absolutely worth it.","October 6, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Throughout five chapters, each made up of about four screens filled with things to interact with, you'll click on various people or mechanisms to initiate quests to find some hidden items they require. Once found and brought back, it will typically trigger a mini puzzle of some kind and give you another item upon completion that'll help you progress further. That's basically the long and short of it.\n\nThere is some kind of story about a meteor hitting "Tiny Planet" and scattering the world apart in the form of jigsaw pieces which are hidden all over the place, but it's largely inconsequential and serves only to back up a puzzle mechanic and explain how you access each chapter in turn (even though the jigsaw pieces aren't actually necessary to move on). There also seems to be a recurring character that appears in paintings and photographs showing him at different stages as he grows up, but the significance of this is never explained. Presumably we're retracing his steps in places that either he had an impact on, or which had an impact on him. It's hard to tell, and to be perfectly honest, even harder to care, since this is never expanded upon in any meaningful way or as any clear goal for the player.\n\nMost of the puzzles and hidden objects are pretty fun and fair deals, but occasionally there's the odd obscure one that will have you either losing faith in all humanity or else looking up a guide. I'm also really not a fan of them messing with the scale of the hidden objects, like having large jigsaw pieces in one place, then other, much small ones in other places yet still at the same distance away from the camera perspective. More consistancy of scale with the onjects would be appreciated.\n\nYou'll have a fun, if not somewhat forgettable, two or so hours with the game, and have the option to replay any puzzle when you reach the end... which is possibly the most anti-climactic end I've ever experienced in a game. But I'd still recommend it for anyone looking for a quick break through a visually pretty world with some fun and engaging puzzles.","October 11, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They are entirely unlike the other puzzles in the game which are more cerebral and less... stupid. I wish they could be skipped. That being said there are only two of them, but they almost made me give up on the game.\n\nTwo, the transition between stages is really really bad. You have to collect all these puzzle pieces, and I was going to commend the game for designing it so that I had actually already found all the puzzle pieces before I completed the level and didn't need to spend time scouring for them (there's enough of that in the game anyway) but it turns out you don't actually need to find them all; for the 3rd stage I progressed without having all the puzzle pieces.\n\nEither way, you have to do this jigsaw of the world between stages, and it's frankly, awful filler. Jigsaw games exist, and I wnjoy them, but what sets this one apart and brings it to a transendant level of awfulness is that maybe 20% of the pieces are sky, and while that's fine, sky has some texture to it... nope, the puzzle pieces are rendered with bloom on them that makes it impossible to read any subtle indicators.\n\nTo make the complaints of the transitions sucking a triqueta, I should also point out that the game locks up for a few seconds between stages, making me worried it will crash before I can put the puzzle pieces together.\n\nI quite literally got a headache playing this, but for this kind of game that's quite ordinary, and like all games of this kind you need a walk through open in the background, but I found I only refered to it a few times for the more obnoxious puzzles and teeny tiny collectables. Y'know, to get the game finished in one sitting without my head exploding. I neededn't have worried so much, because it actually saves mid-level, but this isn't advertised anywhere, so I assumed that, like a lot of games of this genre, it didn't, and I was always too caught up in it all to test.\n\nThe ending is deeply unsatisfying, OR it glitched and I missed it.

A puzzle game with no real challenges can easily get a bit too casual and thus boring.\n\nSpeaking of art style, I also enjoyed how some objects on the screen react to the mouse pointer, such as cables and lines shifting when you move over them. Quite nice. Though subtle, it makes the scene feel so much more alive.\n\nThere are in-game hints, with a clever and original time-delay between hints that seem to require a certain number of flies to be clicked on before a new one becomes available. Depending on what section you're in, a hint will either show you something you should be clicking on the screen, or it gives a solution hint to one of the puzzle games. It's simply nicely done.\n\nThe music is nice, downbeat and in the background, well suited for a game that requires focus such as this one, though it did start feeling a bit repetitive after a while - as music does in most games.\n\nThere is only one thing missing from this game, and that is decent video options to make it other than its original pixel dimensions. As I sometimes have to do this with older games anyway, it wasn't much bother for me just changing my screen's resolution through the control panel to suit the game.\n\nIn the end, I think it took me a bit less than 3.5 hour playing through the whole game, though with a few distractions along the way that probably kept me from doing it at optimum efficiency. At its current RRP, I think it is very decent value for money. On sale, or in a bundle, it should be mandatory shopping for anyone who loves puzzle games or even for those who just enjoy the art style.\n\n","May 18, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What drew me in initially was the visual style. Every level has an uncanny level of detail, making the experience very pleasing to the eye. Gameplay involves travelling from room to room, solving simple puzzles and searching for puzzle pieces along the way to complete a virtual puzzle that advances you to the next world. It's a simple formula, and probably would start to get boring if the game were any longer, but it works and is engaging while it lasts.\n\nThere were definitely a couple of downfalls. There were a couple puzzle pieces in levels that were simply impossible for me to find. After long periods of searching every inch of the level, there were instances where I was forced to look up tutorials on YouTube, which really took me out of the experience. Most likely you will experience this once or twice, and maybe you will be more perceverent than I was and succeed, but it will still be frustrating nonetheless. Also, there is no reason to play this game a second time, for you will know the location of the puzzle pieces. There are a couple of minigames that become available upon completion of the main story, but those are only a minor distration.\n\nIf you're looking for a super casual game that's accessible and pretty to look at, this is definitely your cup of tea.","August 17, 2012","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

They are entirely unlike the other puzzles in the game which are more cerebral and less... stupid. I wish they could be skipped. That being said there are only two of them, but they almost made me give up on the game.\n\nTwo, the transition between stages is really really bad. You have to collect all these puzzle pieces, and I was going to commend the game for designing it so that I had actually already found all the puzzle pieces before I completed the level and didn't need to spend time scouring for them (there's enough of that in the game anyway) but it turns out you don't actually need to find them all; for the 3rd stage I progressed without having all the puzzle pieces.\n\nEither way, you have to do this jigsaw of the world between stages, and it's frankly, awful filler. Jigsaw games exist, and I wnjoy them, but what sets this one apart and brings it to a transendant level of awfulness is that maybe 20% of the pieces are sky, and while that's fine, sky has some texture to it... nope, the puzzle pieces are rendered with bloom on them that makes it impossible to read any subtle indicators.\n\nTo make the complaints of the transitions sucking a triqueta, I should also point out that the game locks up for a few seconds between stages, making me worried it will crash before I can put the puzzle pieces together.\n\nI quite literally got a headache playing this, but for this kind of game that's quite ordinary, and like all games of this kind you need a walk through open in the background, but I found I only refered to it a few times for the more obnoxious puzzles and teeny tiny collectables. Y'know, to get the game finished in one sitting without my head exploding. I neededn't have worried so much, because it actually saves mid-level, but this isn't advertised anywhere, so I assumed that, like a lot of games of this genre, it didn't, and I was always too caught up in it all to test.\n\nThe ending is deeply unsatisfying, OR it glitched and I missed it.

The price is reasonable, and it's fun enough to be a great value for the money.\n\nI give it a 9/10.","April 18","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazerniel/recommended/96000/","kazerniel","kazerniel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazerniel/","625 products in account","To summarise my major emotion about TTBS: it's frustrating.\n\nThe game has a sharp, yet storybook-like art style, catchy (though quickly monotonous) music, and a hidden object/puzzle/adventure gameplay. I love all of these features, then what went wrong?\n\nThe game basically doesn't contain any written or spoken text, and any hints it gives about objectives or solutions are extremely sparse and unhelpful. Thus a significant portion of my playtime was spent wandering around the same handful of screens, trying to figure out what the game wants me to do.\n\nOnce you do figure it out, the rest of the time is spent either hunting minute objects that you've passed many times before, but only become collectable when the game decides to do so, or doing one of the quite difficult puzzles (without a skip function and barely a single hint! annoying!) or one of the timed minigames (which really don't fit to the otherwise quite laidback gameplay).\n\nTo acquire any kind of help from the game, you have to collect 30 little floating bugs for each use of the hint button, and even then it only showed a hint to me on puzzle screens, not when I spent ages looking for the last few tiny objects in the general game screens.\n\nDespite the art style being pleasant, the game seems to have quite a confusion on what visual theme it wants to pursue - the end result is a haphazard mix of fairytale, steampunk-ish and retro-futuristic elements.\n\nAnother noticeable thing for me was the lack of "player character". There's no body through which a player acts, feeling like I was some invisible disembodied force which still needed lifts and ladders to get to various places, resulting in the weird, empty feeling of both being there and not being there. It was probably one of the reasons why I didn't connect emotionally with the game at all - it felt like a soulless exercise of cookie-cutter charm.\n\nThrough my playtime the game felt more and more like a chore that I just wanted to be over and done with - then I remembered that games are supposed to be fun, and just dropped it altogether. A disappointment!\n\nPS: I recommend to either use a walkthrough, or go play a game with actual charm, character and way less frustrating gameplay, like Botanicula or Samorost.","December 16, 2015","false","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember one guy playing this on YouTube and I was instantly hooked. I think what's really brought me in was the soundtrack of the game. It is the most relaxing soundtrack I've ever heard in any game really. It doesn't have that epic Halo theme, but it suits the game very well indeed.\n\nThe hand drawn pictures are phenomenal pretty and you step into a whole other world. If you don't know the game already it's about you collecting puzzles to piece back the earth. It's a quite interesting journey with a shallow ending.\n\nIt has mini games, which might be frustrating for some people, but it's not something that ruins the experience of the game, but it's worth to point out. This is one of my favorite point-to-click games, and it's definitely up there with Machinarium, even though the two games are totally different. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves these types of games.","April 19","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Longer if new to the genre.\n\nThe only negative is the issue regarding a few of the art assets in the game, which may have been borrowed and then altered to suit the style of the game, but there is a fine line between copying and inspired by.\n\nRegardless, The Tiny Bang Story is a breath of fresh air, relaxing, unique, and worth your time. If you do decide to try it and enjoy it, I also recommend all the games I've mentioned above, as they are equally as good and enjoyable.\n\n","May 31","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
