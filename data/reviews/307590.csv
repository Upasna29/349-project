Well that's what Penarium does to me. Penarium is a rage-inducingly difficult platformer survival game where you will always feel determined to be able to complete the next level how ever many deaths it takes.\n\nIn penarium you control a boy called Willy. He strives to become a top circus performer. His wish comes true when a travelling circus man comes and introduces himself to him. However it's not as he expected. Willy is sent to entertain a crowd of bloodthirsty sadistic people. His goal is to survive in increasingly difficult circus stadiums while being attacked by various different traps. Definitely not an easy task.\n\nThat is the main premise of Penarium. You are basically in a small arena that is filled with various traps. You can jump across platforms to avoid these traps. Within these rooms you have different tasks to complete. This can be something as simple as collecting barrels or something difficult like having to stay in a moving spotlight for the allocated amount of time. There was a suprising amount of variety in these different tasks and I didn't find myself getting bored of them at all. My favourite of the tasks was basically a "simon says" where you have to copy the pattern of pressed buttons in the correct order.\n\nWhile doing these tasks the traps will change frequently giving you different things to avoid. This keeps the gameplay a challenge and means you can't learn the patterns to make it too easy. The traps you are given are semi-random as well as the patterns they move in. Some levels have a scripted set of traps and others are completely random. There is also a fantastic variety in the types of traps. Each are unique in their own way. They include traps like homing missiles, electric cannons, moving lasers and birds that fly away with the barrels. They each require very different strategies to avoid them and so change up the gameplay for you constantly.\n\nPenarium has 3 different gamemodes. Within the campaign mode you get all of these different modes that I described above. They are organized into levels of increasing difficulty. There isn't a huge of levels in the game being only 30 levels total. However with the insane difficulty that I mentioned earlier they will take a long time to complete each. I estimate i've probably spent around 4 hours on the campaign so far and gotten to level 23.\n\nIt then has the arcade mode. This is a pure survival mode. It uses the barrel gamemode. You have to collect as many barrels  as possible. It is unlimited and completely random. Attached to this gamemode is a leaderboard so that you can compete against your friends to collect the most barrels possible. This is a nice additional feature because the gamemode would be incomplete without it.\n\nThe final gamemode is multiplayer. This is split into 2 submodes which are versus and co-op. This is probably where I had my most fun playing. In versus mode you compete with the other player to click each button that spawns first. You also have the added ability to jump on the other persons head and knock them out for a short period. I had a huge amount of fun in this mode. Then you have co-op. In this mode each of you has a different button to press and you have to stand on them at the same time. Again it is a survival mode and you have to try and do it for as long as possible. There is also a leaderboard attached to this. Unfortunately multiplayer is only local though and can only be enjoyed by a maximum of two people. I would have liked to at least see online multiplayer implemented.\n\nWithin the arcade mode you also have a store. This can be used to purchase upgrades that can be used to help you survive longer. I haven't had much of a chance to test this but I thought it was worth mentioning. However i'm not a big fan of this system and would prefer just a straight up survival with no additional benefits.\n\nPenarium itself also has a certain charm to it. The graphics style is designed in a striking pixel art fashion which I absolutely adore. Arenas could very easily be bland and static but they have so much variety to them graphically. The backgrounds are even full of activity and animations that make the world seem very much alive. Penariums cutscenes also have a wonderful charm to them. The voiceover is mesmerizingly good and really sets you in the mood of the game. A wonderful circus soundtrack also helps to build this atmosphere. The only issue I do have with the soundrack is that it can get very repetitive after a while because it doesn't have enough variety.\n\nOverall if you love difficult games and are a fan of platformers then Penarium is definitely a game for you. The developer has gone all out to create an experience full of variety and a beatifully styled world with a unique charm to it. However if you don't like difficult games then you can safely avoid Penarium as it definitely isn't a game for you. But if you do I think the price of £6.99 is more than reasonable for the insane amount of fun you will get.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was provided with a free early review key by the developer to make this review.","September 22, 2015","true","9.2"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","31","39","5","0"

Willy, the farmer's overweight kid, wanted. Farmer's work wasn't exciting at all for him, so when he met a suspicious guy with a mask who offered him a ride in his wagon, he wanted to have an amazing journey for a day. But, oh boy, he was stupid. The masked guy locked up Willy until they arrived to the sadistic circus, Penarium. And now it's up to you - can you survive in control of Willy?\n\nPenarium is a platformer with priority on difficulty and simple controls - all you can do is running and (double) jumping. You are thrown into the circus arena where you have to do specific tasks (break barrels, burst balloons or push buttons in specific order) while dodging deadly traps. There are no lives nor checkpoints, you just have to do your best or... try again.\n\nWhat I've really liked on Penarium is the whole pixelart graphics style with cool animation work. There isn't much environment variety (only 3 circus arenas) but there is fair amount of traps that can make every level a little different (well, from what I've seen, only the order of traps is random, but that's still something if you're dying often). Also, the game has pretty good soundtrack with circus melodies that can extend your hate towards circus and clowns, especially because of the overall higher difficulty the game has.\n\nI've already broached the subject of length with low amount of environment variety and, well, that's the biggest downside of Penarium. There are only 30 levels (challenges) that can be done in pretty short time, depending on your skill and experience with platformers. To those who want more, there is an arcade mode where you also collect coins to get bonuses for that mode. If you have a friend to play with, there are also co-op and versus modes. But I guess that's not enough to those who expect some sort of main campaign with stable unlocking of game's content.\n\nConclusion:Penarium is a nice difficult platformer, with polished design and fluid gameplay. If you don't mind its shorter length, or you want another game to play with a friend on local multiplayer, it's definitely worth buying.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 2","true","7.1"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","18","22","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/307590/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2003 products in account","Penarium is a 2D platformer with a very simple premise, surviving in an arena full of deadly traps, all designed to murder you in the most horrible ways. It is one of those games that made me go “Just one more”, despite the many times I fell victim to the treacherous traps.\n\nYou play as Willy, a boy who’s been bored of working every single day of his life in his father’s farm and who is craving for an adventure. Then, one day, a circus arrives in town and Willy feels an uncontrollable urge to be part of it. And so, lured by a mysterious man he is trapped inside a wagon and thrown into the circus floor. Willy must now beat every circus challenge in order to be free, he has to become the ultimate champion of Penarium.\n\nThe game features three different modes, multiplayer, campaign and arcade. I didn’t try multiplayer so I’m just going to skip that one. Campaign mode is divided into three different arenas, each arena having ten different challenges. Upon completing an arena, you’ll be able to play it on Arcade mode. Arcade mode is basically survival mode, you must survive for as long as possible while destroying barrels that spawn throughout the arena, while also collecting coins that you can then use to buy upgrades. Every 5 barrels you destroy, the traps will change. Both on Arcade and Campaign mode, the traps don’t have a specific order, they are random so you don’t know what to expect and must adapt everytime the traps change.\n\nThe traps itself are pretty diverse ranging from heat-seeking missiles, tesla coils, bees and various others. The game slowly introduces you to new types of traps, progressively increasing the difficulty.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple, each arena is composed of several platforms and you have to stay on top of those, if you fall you will die. On the other hand, when there is not some type of trap blocking your way, you can transition from one edge of the arena to the other and so do missiles, bullets, etc. This allows for some tricky manoeuvering while trying to complete each different challenge. Challenges require you to do various different things such as, pressing buttons in a predetermined order, destroying barrels or blowing up balloons.\n\nYou’ll probably die a lot in Penarium. It takes some trial and error in order to figure out how each trap works and how you can avoid it. That said, the game has a very lovely pixel art style and the cutscenes particularly are pretty well realized. The narrator also has a very cool voice and the music overall is very fitting for the the whole circus/fair theme.\n\nOverall thoughts:\nPenarium was a blast to play. Despite the somewhat short length of the campaign, depending on how good you are, the Arcade mode is also pretty fun and allows for some replayability. The game is charming and pretty, extremely fun to play and there’s a huge amount of satisfaction everytime you beat one of those though levels. I avidly recommend it to every single fan of platformers!","March 18","true","7.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

All of them!\nHow could they!? HOW COULD THEY!?\nWilly’s just a poor and chubby farmer boy who’s just bored so he joined this big and fun looking Circus … only to find out … to find out …!\n\nRead on if you want to know what this game’s all about.\n\nStoryThe game’s about the hero, the legend, the man himself … Willy!\nJust a lil’, poor and chubby farmer boy who’s just bored out of his mind. He’s living all alone with his father since Willy’s his only child. One of these days there appears something magnificent.\nA Circus! Seeing all the fun he could had Willy decides to approach the Circus and is greeted by the Director which offers him a position in his Circus and invites him to a wagon. Right after Willy boards said wagon they take off leaving his poor and old father behind and Willy’s now supposed to entertain the crowd in the Circus … extra … vaganza … PENARIUM!\nOh and it’s a sadistic one.\n\nGameplayYou’re supposed to entertain the crowd Kiddo. So that means dance! Dance Willy, dance! Or die!\nBoth are fine since that’s what the crowd wants to see! - Director B. Utthole\n\nWell, well, well … The game takes place inside a circus, duh. Not just a circus … the circus extravaganza PENARIUM! And the crowd goes wild! That’s probably because someone died again. Oh well onto the actual gameplay!\n\nYou start of inside a cage and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a Director gives you orders. That can be to smash 20 Barrels or to fetch his Body Lot- errr I mean his Dark Magic Potion. Ultimately that would sound rather boring so why not put up some Death-Traps? Yup. You’re supposed to do a bunch of tasks while avoiding those pesky traps in order to survive. Sounds more interesting doesn’t it?\nAnd the game’s full of those darn traps let me tell you that.\nThere’s a machine moving on the top of the screen and dropping a big ball every now and then in order to kill you, or there’s another one shooting icicles trying to give you a Brain Freeze, oh and hey also pierce through the stage so beware of the pointy bits!\nHell there’s even a giant Death Laser moving around the map relatively fast in order to annihilate you! And for what!? Just to entertain some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s … Sigh.\nBut the one trap that annoys me the most are those birds … God I hate those birds. They’re just flying around grabbing those barrels you have to smash. So that means you have to chase them, while avoiding all the other traps and death of course.\nBut the Director wouldn’t be the Director if he’d only tell you to smash some barrels no.\nYou also have to step on some buttons in the right order to survive the stage. And if you fail to do so then you can start all over again. However … if you manage to survive a bunch of stages you’ll be rewarded! Yes rewarded! You get ballons! I mean which child doesn’t like ballons?\nTo be specific … BLOOD BALLONS! GUAHAHAHHAHA!\nYup everything in this Circus is to entertain the crowd. You have to collect the ballons in a specific order and in timely fashion or else you’re not gonna see tomorrow.\n\nThe only thing that you can do in this game is run and jump.\nHere’s the good news. You can jump out of the screen, unless there’s a trap set up, so you will end up on the opposite side of the level. Neat ain’t it?\nAlright and here’s the bad news. All those traps can do exactly the same. Be it rockets, giant balls, lasers or whatever. You all are allowed to do that which at the end of the day will save your behind more often then it would kill you, let me tell you that.\n\nVisualQuite charming. Really shows Willy from his best side!\nLet’s be serious for a while. The art style’s well chosen. Here’s the thing. The game’s pretty harsh and needless to say sadistic. Playing such a game in 3D would be a lot … how do I put it .. well worse and more serious. Choosing this art style though makes it very clear that it’s not be taken serious. It’s meant to be fun. I mean not dying is fun right? And listening to a big ol’ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a Director with the mouth of an idiot is fun as well right?\nWell the character’s are looking good and so do the stages. Oh and the traps yes of course. They look good. They look even better when you survive them!\n\nI don’t know about you but this art style gives the game a very unique personality and to be quite honest with you it’s thanks to that, that I do enjoy the game tremendously!\n\nAudioThe music manages to stay in the background. Which isn’t always a good thing but this time it is.\nThe sound effects on the other hand like the explosions … Well you hear them. That’s a good thing. Even better is that they do actually sound nice.\nOverall it’s quite fitting and it’s also thanks to the music that there’s no pressure on you. It somehow manages to put one into this comical and dark mood at times, also thanks to the dialogues, so you end up enjoying every death.\n\nDialoguesThe real charm is in the dialogues though. I found myself looking forward to what the Director had to say this time. I mean when he told me I had to go and fetch his Body Lotion ... yes it's body Lotion and not dark magic voodoo potions of death or whatever! Anyway I really enjoyed those dialogues.\nIt's stuff like that, which make a game rather unique and fun. I mean there's not really that much text but the tiny bit of text truly makes a difference.\n\nWhat else can I say?It’s fun and quite a surprise. I’m not gonna lie I didn’t expect too much when I read the description of the game. In fact I solely bought it thanks to the art style. Call me crazy but hey I know what I like!\nIt’s perfect for sinking some time into it every now and then. It can become quite frustrating and annoying at times, especially when you end up dying just because you chased one of those damn birds and ended up shot by a rocket or worse. I really hate those birds!\nOne of these days I’m gonna make myself some fried chicken and I will laugh over my more than satisfying victory …!\nIt’s a fun game though. It really is. If you enjoy arcade, arena, plattformer or just games which are quite like that then go and get it. And even if you don’t it’s well worth your money.\nDamn Birds …\n\nSo ask yourself. Can you live with yourself knowing that,just because you didn't buy the game, you let poor Willy die a horrendous death? That you didn't try to help him survive in the (sadistic) Circus Extravaganza Penarium? That you don't care whether or not he lives or dies and even meets his poor old dad one day again?\n\n...\n\nEven if you said yes to all those go and buy the damn game it's fun and well worth it!","September 25, 2015","true","4.4"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","0"

The art style and soundtrack is really charming, and the controls are very fluid, you never feel like you die in an unfair way. My only flaw with the game would be that the music does get kinda repetitive, but that doesn't bother me that much, since the sound that is in the game is really appropriate and great to listen to while dying to all kinds of different traps!\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, there's 2 modes, Arcade and Campaign (that I know of). Campaign is the story-line, which brings you through 3 different arena's, the missions in each one getting increasingly harder. Arcade is where you'll probably spend most time in if you're a collector, 100%-er or an achievement hunter, and it's really fun too. There's a whole new mechanic in it where you can buy cards (power-ups) which you get each couple of waves of traps. Because of the quick respawn you'll be putting a lot more time into the game than you originally planned, which is definitely a good thing.\n\nI'd say Penarium is soooo worth it, go for it if you like these types of games!","February 7","true","6.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinmai/recommended/307590/","shinmai","shinmai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinmai/","1625 products in account","tl;drAn unpolished game in the "difficult platformer" genre, with an okay story, decent music, and hit & miss art that suffers from technical issues. The final nail in the coffin is the inconsistent difficulty, and uninspired level design. Short-ish, as well.\n\nwordsPrenarium is a game, that on paper sounds like I'd absolutely love it, but after completing it, I don't have much good to say about it.\n\nI'm a big fan of nice pixel art, and Prenarium's artist isn't bad, but the way the art is used makes it look sloppy and unpolished; there are scaling issues, inconsistent pixel sizes, roatated pixels etc. etc. Some of the sprites also look like placeholders, waiting to be replaced with something that better fits the rest of the art.\nThe controls aren't bad, per se, but combined with the collision detection / hitboxes, make for a... wonky experience. This isn't helped by the sloppy level design, that doesn't seem to take the movement limitations of the character into account.\n\nAnother big problem is the inconsistent difficulty. The difficulty progression is all over the place, coming to a head in the last three levels; I was stuck at the third-to-last level, 28 for well over an hour of non-stop playing. After finally completing the level after countless attempts, I didn't feel a sense of achievement, I was just annoyed. I beat the next level on the first try, and the final level in five or six tries.\nI enjoy difficult games, even punishingly difficult ones, but most of the difficulty in Penarium is very artificial, either based on heavy randomization, lengthy sequences or near-pixel-perfect jumps.\n\nThe best part about the game is the story, and even that is basically four cutscenes riddled with the same graphical quirks as the rest of the game, and a few lines of in-game dialogue.\n\nPenarium consists of three stages, where players are expected to complete one of fourth objectives, while avoiding a variety of traps. The most common, and least annoying, of the objectives is "smashin" (i.e. colliding with) a certain number of barrels. The other two are popping a sequence of balloons, which heavily suffers from the fact that 99% of the balloons are just high enough not to be reachable without jumping, which coupled with the fact that the jump height is fixed makes some of the balloon sequences annoying. The third objective is collecting five of each red, blue and green potions into matchingly colored cauldrons, it's basically like the barrel smashing game, but with a slight twist.\nThe fourth objective is a game of Simon on four buttons, and is easily the most annoying part of the game. Simon is Simon, no matter which way you twist it, and it's just not engaging or enjoyable, and feels totally out of place, like a sequence where you need to file your taxes in the middle of a Doom level.\n\nWith an arcade mode in addition to the campaign, I wouldn't complain about the lenght if the game was good, but it bears mentioning, I completed the campaign and got all but six achievements (one of which is "Die 1000 times") in a single ~7h session. Someone more proficient in precise platforming could easily complete the game in 3-4 hours, but the thing is, Penarium overstays it's welcome well before that.\n\nThe back story and world of Penarium is interesting, the premise of the gameplay is promising and the artists seem competent, but the whole game feels unpolished and not very well thought out, which is a shame, because the game definitely feels like it could be excellent, if a little bit more work had gone into it. As it stands, however, I can't think of anyone I'd recommend Penarium to, everything it tries to do, many other games to better, and even at it's best, it's mediocre and bland.","February 6","false","7.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

Mercifully, this game starts you over instantly and makes dying a frustrating but fun experience you can laugh at instead of a giant time sapping annoyance.\n\nIt's not a game with a particularly long lifespan, but if you happen to get it in a bundle or in a sale for pennies then you can rest assured that you'll enjoy the couple hours you spend with it.\n\nAs with most games of this nature, best enjoyed with a game pad.","March 8","true","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You are subjected to drowning, platforms being blown up, the obstacles being moved around on you, rhythmically crushing walls, dragons that burst out of the wall in long parabolic arcs that you must avoid, and numerous other things. The levels themselves are very small – a single screen wide – and they loop around the edges, so you can jump from the right side of the screen to the left and vice-versa.\n\nYour goal is to clear all thirty of these levels. If you die during them, you must start that level over again; most of the levels are very short, but even still, they are broken up into multiple (3-4) sections; the longer levels have as much as 10 sections, and can be kind of frustrating to start over. Even still, even with this artificially lengthened gameplay time, it still takes two hours to beat.\n\nYou do learn to get better at the game, which leads to the somewhat strange situation where you are likely to struggle the most with the levels more towards the middle of the game than the ones at the very end, as the difficulty only changes modestly, and there are only a very limited number of platform setups throughout the entire game.\n\nAfter you beat those levels, you’re done and the game is over. You can play the arcade mode, which is more of the same but gives you coins which you can use to buy cards which give you minor bonuses periodically in the arcade mode. It is endless, and you can try to survive and get a high score, but it is pretty repetitive and not very entertaining.\n\nThere is just nothing to recommend here. The graphics are unappealing, the levels are bland, boring, and repetitive, the game is incredibly short and yet still too long for the amount of content it has…\n\nThis game is not only not worth your money, it is not worth your time.","February 6","false","4.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/recommended/307590/","randomiseuser","RandomiseUser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/","284 products in account","Penarium is an arcade platform game set in a circus where you have to complete a given challenge without being killed by a trap or falling off the bottom of the level.\n\nThe traps appear in the level one or two at a time, and include homing missiles, spiky moving walls, machine guns, deadly bouncing balls and more. Some are quite inventive and are more about making life difficult rather than killing you - check out the thieving bird.\n\nThere are three modes: campaign mode, arcade mode and local two-player mode.\n\nThe campaign mode is a set of 30 prescribed levels with a dark little story about how a child (who looks straight out of The Far Side) is kidnapped and forced to perform for his freedom by the mysterious masked Director.\n\nThis mode offers three different arenas, each split into 10 levels. Each level has one goal - destroy 20 barrels, collect 35 balloons in order, press 20 buttons in the order specified etc. Every 5 things you do triggers a new set of traps to replace the old - which are (sometimes) chosen at random.\n\nWatch Campaign Mode gameplay in this video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKmPjDCY96k\n\nThe arcade mode allows you to pick one of the three arenas, and you get an endless version of the level where you have to destroy as many barrels as you can, with worldwide leaderboards. Again, every 5 barrels you smash triggers new traps. One death and it's all over.\n\nYou can collect coins in arcade mode that allow you to buy power-up cards at the shop on the map screen. These power-ups can be played during future arcade mode runs to give you a temporary one-off buff, such as flight, coin magnet and invincibility when standing still.\n\nThe cards don't seem hugely useful since you have to buy them before you start the run and drop into the arena (one at a time) as a reward for smashing a certain number of barrels. It would be better if you had the choice of playing the perfect card at the perfect moment, eg play the invincibility-while-standing-still when you couldn't otherwise escape the sweeping vertical laser.\n\nPenarium is unexpectedly not that difficult. None of the traps are unfair or overpowered - in fact, some of them (such as the water) are easily ignored and could do with toughening up. There's never more than two types of trap active at once, and sometimes only one, even late in the game. This means you'll be able to get through the campaign very quickly.\n\nI haven't played the local multiplayer, but should cause plenty of excellent swearing. Both competitive & co-op require the players to hold down randomly appearing buttons for a few seconds each - in competitive, there's one button to fight over, in co-op both players get their own button. There's only partial collision - you can't bump the other player off a platform, but you can stun them by landing on them.\n\nI'd like both arcade mode and multiplayer to offer different challenges instead of just barrel-smashing (arcade) and button-pressing (multiplayer). A little customisation would go a long way here.\n\nTo get the most out of Penarium you'll need to learn to love the beat-the-high-score arcade mode and hopefully get some couch multiplayer action going. Campaign mode won't keep you for long, but in general the game never makes you wait to get back in the action, has a very replayable arcade concept (perfect for quick coffee-break blasts) and best of all, contains NO CLOWNS.\n\nThanks to Self Made Miracle for the preview copy.","September 22, 2015","true","3.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

That's pretty much it. Because the story is basically non-existent, I'm not gonna take it into account.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game is nothing special: the 16-bit look is charming at first, but there isn't much variety in the levels to make anything stand out. Sometimes you might struggle recognising some threats that appear.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe game features 3 arenas with 10 levels each, as well as 4 game modes. In the Campaign, you complete levels to get money to unlock new features and to play locally or online with friends and other players.\nGoing into this game, you have to ask yourself one question: are you willing to play some really hard challenges in which there is something constantly trying to kill you, just to unlock more content? If so, you will have fun like I did playing the game. All you can do is jump around, avoid threats and pick up objects.\nI had more fun playing locally with a friend than playing the solo campaign, so I strongly recommend having a friend by your side when playing.\n\nCHALLENGEThe challenges are increasingly harder and harder, to a point of extreme frustration. If you enjoy getting your ♥♥♥ kicked by sometimes unfair threats, then you will have fun with the game's singleplayer.\n\nSOUNDThe sound effects are of very little importance, and the soundtrack, while fun at first, quickly started getting on my nerves for its repetitiveness.\n\nREPLAYABILITYMost of the lasting appeal of the game comes from its multiplayer components: every achievement is pretty easy to unlock, and the campaign will last for about an hour.\n\nOverall, if you like arena games or are looking for something to play with a buddy, I recommend this. Beware, however, of its high difficulty spikes and sometimes unfair challenges.\n\nStory: n/a\nGraphics: 7\nGameplay: 7\nChallenge: 9\nSound: 6.5\nReplayability: 6\n\nENJOYMENT: 7\nFRUSTRATION: 9\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","September 22, 2015","true","6.0"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","14","26","2","0"

You'll have fun if you like a challenge. But I felt it was lacking somehow. Perhaps it was the short length, roughly two~three hours for the campaign, another hour or so for "arcade" achievements, and inflated awhile longer getting the 1,000 death achievement. Perhaps it was the single-screen levels, would've had more interesting level design if they scrolled. Perhaps its something else. In the end I had fun, but not "full price" fun.

While some level designs and use of traps do well, it can't keep that consistency going for a long period, and ends up showing you what it has over the first hour in its entirety. There are some good traps, like the bouncing bowling ball that attempt to mess with your expectations, but arenas are reused too often for the games own good, and needed something more in the campaign to really stand out. Sadly, the best I can say about Penarium is that it's competent at what it does: but competent at what it does not mean I can recommend it, with all the games currently out there at the moment. It's unable to shine and sadly, that's an absolute necessity in this current marketplace.\n\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/wTwi2iCYfKI\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nScreen mechanics of wrapping around to the other side of the screen is done well and adds a little bit of excitement.\nCore controls are competent and give you the right amount of control you need: not too punishing, but not too forgiving.\nPowerups when earned give the game desperate variety that it lacked in the campaign mode (arcade mode >>> Campaign)\nThe game's not bad, it's solid in several areas. But....\n-:\nIt also doesn't shine at all. Nothing stands out as a a core strength.\nVery flash in the pan. Burns brightly at first, but fizzles out once the game doesn't have as many new elements to really keep it going.\nDo question if some scenarios in terms of barrels are technically unwinnable in the main campaign due to the timing and mechanics on CERTAIN stages. Randomization element here feels like it hurt the game at times.\nJust an emphasis needed on more. Even at a higher price to balance with the development, the game needed a bit more to stay around.\nStory really felt like it could have had more done with it. Felt tacked on.\nLevel design is VERY hit and miss. There are some good levels, but others are reused too often and don't take advantage of the gameplay at all.","September 28, 2015","false","3.1"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","11","21","0","0"

Definitely worth a buy when on sale (currently $6, for example), but $10 might leave you bit underwhelmed.\n\nIt's a twitch pixel platformer that progresses through beating challenges. Challenges are organized into three areans, with ten challenges per arena. The challenges have a nice variety, alternating between collecting barrels, popping balloons in the right order, playing simon says with buttons, and collecting and depositing potions. The layouts and challenges alter enough that it never gets stale. Likewise, new hazards appear as you progress keeping things fresh.\n\nWhen the campaign is finished, there is an arcade mode, that tests your skills as you try to collect as many barrels in a row before failure. Every 5 barrels and the hazard(s) change. There's also an improvement mechanic here by way of buff cards. During arcade mode, as you bust barrels, coins splash onto the screen. You can then collect these coins to be spent later on unlocking buff cards. Buff cards will then appear while in arcade mode to aid you on your path to a high score.\n\nVery satisfied with this game.

When you decide to join the circus you quickly find out that this is no normal circus as you are thrust into an arena where your life is always at risk.\n\nPenarium includes two different game modes.\n\nThe campaign teaches you the mechanics of the game and provides different challenges that you must complete. The campaign is kind of short since it will probably only take around 3-4 hours to complete.\n\nThe arcade mode lets you try to survive as long as possible while collecting/smashing barrels. You can collect coins that you use to purchase upgrades to help you on future attempts. The objective of the arcade mode is to survive as long as possible while smashing as many barrels as possible.\n\nOverall I had fun with Penarium. Outside of the theme though Penarium is not a highly original platformer. The game doesn't really add any new mechanics and will feel familiar to people who play a lot of platformers.\n\nDifficulty wise I would say that Penarium is medium-hard to hard. You will die a lot but the game is not as difficult as some of the other "hard" platformers.\n\nIf you like hard platformers and you think the theme/concept is interesting I think you would like Penarium and you should pick it up.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of Penarium.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","September 22, 2015","true","5.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Controls are super simple (left, right, jump, double jump) so the skill is all in the movement.\n\nThe visuals are very nice though there's a somewhat limited selection of areas and threats. What's there looks very nice, but it won't take you all that long to see most of it.\n\nPossibly my biggest complaint is Arcade mode can start off pretty slow, and the coin-paid power up system (one off power ups that drop in mid-play, but are bought before starting a round) is a little weird. Campaign mode has a nice ramp up to it and will prepare you well for arcade mode, though the random nature of arcade mode can lead to some frustration.

The music is fits nicely with the theme and the short span and the variety make it's tricky levels fun, replayable and well balanced. While certainly tough at times, the game always feels fair, the game has good weighty feel to it's physics and collision detection are great, when you die, which you will many many times, it's because you made a mistake.

I got the 50 deaths achievement within 40 minutes of play, but never once felt frustrated or that the game was unfair. The gameplay is deceptively simple: all you do is jump between platforms. However, the different level goals, and the absurd amount of continuously changing trap combinations, force you to keep an eye on the entire screen and always keep you on your toes.\n\nThe campaign appears to be somewhat short, i seem to be over halfway through it within an hour of play, though your mileage may vary. Personally i feel that i got my money's worth, but you may want to keep that in mind. There is also an endless survival mode and a local multiplayer mode which further extend the game.\n\nI love everything about the game so far, from the gameplay, to the art, to the music, to the setting, and definitely recommend it.","September 22, 2015","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This drives home my item in the task list to pre-bank a good number of reviews, so that's now on my list.  Regardless time marches on, and with it my need to write today’s review as well, a game from Self Made Miracle called Penarium, a single-screen platformer focusing on precision timing and jumping with the premise of a circus act.  The concept is a rather simple one, you are a mildly overweight, nondescript child who decided to run away to the circus because you felt you were bored with life, and inevitably got exactly what you want, a somewhat interesting time in the circus, though granted the life and death performance aspect of the story was probably something your character wasn't exactly planning on when they devised the whole running away from home thing.  That being said, the flimsy pretext is simply a sugar coating on an actually enjoyable if simple platformer, as your character goes through rounds completing tasks such as collecting falling items or simply surviving the various obstacles for a given period of time.  The controls are simple and intuitive, and the steam controller does an excellent job of  keeping your character moving.  The levels got a bit samey for me over the thirty minutes I played, although each level did bring in interesting obstacles clearly drawn from a random set, which made each playthrough unique.  In the end, I feel like this game is really a solid platformer that you could easily whittle away a bit of time with, though it doesn't necessarily have anything I saw to make it a must buy if you already have a few of the platforming genre on your list to play already.  Keep it in your wishlist to grab if you need a quick time waster, or if it goes on sale.\n\nGame’s Fate: Kept.  great game to waste a few minutes on here and there, and the levels keep things interesting\nBuy/No Buy: If you don’t already have a similar category game, buy this one.  If you do, play that one till you get bored with it, then buy this one.","February 16","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is short, but it's exactly as long as it needs to be. There's something to be said for a game that can be completed in a single sitting, and never feel repetitive or like it's dragging its feet.\n\nI was going to criticise it for being simple. It is simple, but its simplicity is elegant. The combinations of its approximately 15 traps make for some beautifully intense and varied gameplay.\n\nI was going to criticise it for playing like a bonus challenge minigame at the end of a more fleshed-out game. It is reminiscent of a bonus challenge minigame, but unlike such games, it's well-designed, balanced, clever, and difficult to master.\n\nSo now, given the satisfying, challenging gameplay, beautifully realised pixel-art, and surprisingly engrossing setting and characters, I'm left with only one complaint:\n\nWhy is it that a rolling rock that could (and often will) crush me in an instant, does not crush the barrels I'm supposed to break!?","February 7","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game focuses on an overweight child stuck in a literal circus of death. The gameplay is quick and the controls are very responsive.\n\nThe main story tasks you with surviving short challenges that get more difficult and over the top until you're hundreds of feet in the sky, popping balloons while avoiding rockets and dragons. Penarium is very challenging but the levels are so short and you're right back in the action as soon as you die. That coupled with the light hearted comedic tone make it almost impossible to put down. It makes you say "I can do this. Just one more go and I'll have it!" Unfortunately the main story mode is quite short and you can do it in under two hours but there are also challenge arenas with unlockable upgrades to change the game mechanics about and that adds a little replayability.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed it the extra challenges weren't enough to keep me coming back after I beat the main levels.
