I've probably played...dozens... of RPGMaker titles on steam and this is the first time I've actually felt like somebody put some real time, effort and HEART into their RPGMaker game.\n\nPros-\n-The premise is amazing; seriously original, and the setting is a new twist on old hat. Good story. Sadly... I don't usually have the patience for JRPGs... but I really want to find out where they take the story! This one might sway me to finish it once I get Fallout 4 out of the way...\n-Art and assets are nicely done\n-No typos or bad spelling, grammar, etc!!! Sadly, this issue must be addressed in the RPGMaker arena. Anyway, this game clears the bar!\n-Funny dialog, not corny crap like others of this ilk. Self-aware dialog, but used sparingly, so it doesn't break the 4th wall and get silly.\n-Characters are actually interesting! *SPOILERS* but you get a ghost friend, a lady with multiple personalities and you get to control an enemy character. It kind of has a Chrono Cross feel to it, in that way.\n\nCons-\n-I wish the combat were a little quicker. I know you can remove the combat animations in the options, which would help a little, but it just feels like it drags a little in the early part of the game when you fight 1 v 3 enemies and they all take a second to hit... and then you have to set your cursor over again\n-Some aspects of the game could use a little better explaining, like the 'user level' or whatever it was called. The bonus given when beating an area. Not sure I understand the different levels and how its calculated. Also, the item and armor upgrading is a little mysterious and cumbersome since you can't be currently wearing the item you wish to upgrade (Update: they fixed this upgrading nusance)\n\n*Disclaimers*\nI played on Easy mode in order to get as far as possible in a limited time (it is the holidays, after all), so I can't comment on the "standard" difficulty, and;\nI received a free copy of this game in exchange for my honest review.\n\nBottom line: I'll admit, JRPGs aren't really my bag anymore, I was really into them about a decade ago, but this one really has some fresh ideas for the genre. Seriously though, this is one of the best RPGMaker JRPGs I've ever played, it's totally worth it for the full price of $3, and if its on sale, definitely give it a go for the current sale price of a buck and change.","December 11, 2015","true","3.4"," 200 of 250 people (80%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","80","200","250","9","13"

But some games are just too special NOT to give an opinion on.\n\nOH! RPG! is a 'launch' title for the newly released RPGMaker MV. Because MV is new (at the time the game came out) the graphics, sound, music, etc, are fresh and the dev put a lot of effort into making it professional.\n\nThis isn't your typical RPGMaker game. This isn't a cash grab done in 10 hours and released with no care.\n\nAs I said, the dev put in a lot of work. The maps are full of life but nothing is wasted. The paths in the dungeons are never so conviluted that you get lost. The story is top notch. You can beat the game in less than 5 hours but the 'Heroes' are complex, the NPCs that you control are quirky in the right ways, and even the actual NPCs are more deep than "welcome to our city".\n\nThe battle system is great. This is no button masher, where you just hit attack until the enemy dies. Each chapter's character has their own moveset that MUST be used with strategy in order to get by. The bosses especially must be defeated by thought, not by brute force.\n\nThe Devs on this project are very friendly, take a look at the discussion forum for OH! RPG! and you will see they are active and willing to talk about bugs, story, suggestions for additions, or anything else you wish to shoot the breeze about. This is a quality I can't value enough. Many devs forget the player exists once their money has been spent.\n\nWeakpoints? As mentioned before, you can and prob will beat this game in less than 5 hours. So, take this game for what it is. It is a short but extremely fun RPG with replay value as you have a score for each chapter that you can go back and raise any time you wish.","December 14, 2015","true","6.9"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","38","46","2","0"

RPG! is an intriguing role-playing game created by RosePortal Games, a developer you might know from their previous game, Epic Quest of the 4 Crystals. Built with RPGMaker MV, it is a tribute to both the software and the genre as a whole, but also an enjoyable game in its own right. It stands out by telling a story of a world where the heroes were unable to defeat the evil that threatened it, and so humanity is forced to prepare for their inevitable demise. Interestingly, the playable cast consists not of the heroes themselves, but instead various characters that would simply be NPCs in other games, such as a jester or an old lady. The heroes interact with these characters in different ways throughout the story, sometimes receiving help from them and other times providing assistance as they attend to their own desires. While the game is not particularly long, the world is developed so that you still get the feeling of a place that has been adventured through, with already-looted chests and allusions to unseen events. All of this results in a surprisingly compelling setting that, though very recognizable to anyone who has played a classic RPG before, still manages to feel novel.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay of it stays true to the nature of JRPGs.\n\nPros:\n\n~ Huge levels to explore.\n~ The game is made from RPG Maker MV.\n~ Story so far is interesting.\n~ Lots of hero skills to vanquish evil with.\n~ Tons of weapons to find and use.\n~ Battle system is good.\n~ Attack animations are cool.\n~ Tons of monsters to fight and level up.\n~ Sidequest can be easily to get if you travel everywhere.\n~ The music is improved here, and there's a great combination of guitar and a more traditional sound for the genre.\n\n\nCons:\n\n~ Fighting can get repetitive.\n~ Story gets slow at parts.\n~ It can take a long time if you don't know what you are doing.\n\n-I haven't played a lot, but i can recommend you this game, if you like the genre!-\n8/10!\n","April 28","true","19.7"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","21","25","3","3"

RPG.\n\nFirst thing I have to say is that the setting of this game is much darker than the previous, but the story is much more engaging as well and characters are more compeling and interesting, at least to me. I won't get into any spoilers here but let's just say that our main character is not our usual "hero" and his inner struggle is what makes this game so different.\nOnce you start playing this game you won't be able to stop (At least I barely took my hands of my laptop).\nAnd not only because of the story, but also because the maps and the world inside the game is much bigger, so it might take a while to finish a chapter or a part of the story, since there are so many areas to explore and secrets to uncover.\n\nThe combat system has also been improved, however enemies are much harder to beat from start, on normal mode, so you will have to invest in crafting and upgrading potions, weapons and armor, and develop fighting strategies. (Luckily there is a button to try the fight again if you die)\nThat being said the crafting system has been majorly improved as well.\n\nLastly but not least important the artwork in Oh! Rpg, looks even better than in RosePortal's previous games. It looks so very well designed, when it comes to both the characters and enemies. Even the whole world looks more realistic and 3d like compared to other rpg makers.\n\nOverall I think that this is one of the better rpg maker games made by now and at this price it is a definite must buy! :D\nFor the time I played 10/10\n\nI will keep playing the game, as the story got me really intrigued and I can't wait to see what happens next. The review will be further updated and expanded as I play more of the game.","December 11, 2015","true","4.0"," 31 of 45 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","31","45","3","3"

RPG! is, unsurprisingly, an RPGMaker game. At first glance you would think that it is just one of the 138 RPGMaker games that have joined (or plagued?) the Steam store. But, my child, before we jump to conclusions please read this full review. Or simply  jump to the bottom for the TL;DR if you have ADHD.\n\nStory-We all struggle with our patience in RPGMakers. It's only natural. But OH! RPG! managed to bring a refreshing story which isn't just your typical OH! BORING CLICHED RPGMAKER! The premise of the story is that a group of heroes have failed their mission to save the world, however, you -the side character- have taken it upon yourself to face the aftermath of these heroes' mistakes with them. It's an intriguing idea and quite effective- though it can drag on at points. Each character has their own interesting personalities with their own humour. I must say, when I saw one of the negative reviews that said:\n\nOriginally posted by Kistulot:Not Recommended\n5.4 hrs on record\nPosted: 21 January\nThe game uses too many blatant time wasting minigame mechanics, and its humor doesn't work, unless you like heroes being jerks as a great joke. I was willing to try to enjoy it and see it through until I got to the Nun's arc, and encountered this: http://i.imgur.com/VGJTjNX.png\n\nThis is not humor.\nI seriously starting laughing my head off. Funniest joke in the game just got funnier. But overrall, interesting story with a great idea.\n\nGameplay-You control your character through well designed levels and try gathering resources to help you as you encounter the many enemies lurking around. As you are not controlling the heroes you are much weaker when it comes to boss fights. You need to carefully manage your resources and target enemy weaknesses to be most effective. Only problem with this is that the combat can become slightly repetitive occassionally as you will find yourself dying a lot. There also seem to be some bugs to do with crashing but the developer seems to be working on it and accepting feedback. The save system seems to be a bit broken as well.\n\nGraphics-The pixel graphics are very good, backgrounds look just as nice.\n\nHUD-When you open the game up there is a variety if options icluding control configuration.\n\nMusic and sounds-Great soundtrack that was fits the game well, decent sound effects.\n\nSummary\nPros\n✔ Original idea\n✔ Great story\n✔ Interesting characters\n✔ Good humour\n✔ Interesting gameplay\n✔ Good graphics\n✔ Variety of options\n✔ Great soundtrack\n\nCons\n✘ Story can drag on at points\n✘ Combat can be repetitive\n✘ Some bugs\n✘ Save system seems to be a bit broken\n\nConclusion\nOH! RPG! is a breath of fresh air in the overcrowded RPGMaker collection. Is has some minor flaws but they are quickly passable because of the amount of great things the game does. If are wanting to pick up an RPGMaker game, this one should be up there on your list.\n\n7.5/10\n\nLiked that review?

RPG! is an RPG maker game of upper quality , which is rather rare in this ocean of RPG Maker games available. The music is really good. The graphics - or rather the choice of tile sets used - are very cute, colorful, crisp and clean.\n\nWhere the game truly shines is in the gameplay - or more precisely WHO you play. You don't play the heroes - who are mainly selfish brats anyway - but the background-second-roles-NPCs you generally meet in these types of games: for example in the first chapter you play a goblin; in the third one an old lady! Telling you more about these characters would be huge spoilers but just know that even though they're very limited and one dimensional, they're very endearing with their reckless bravery. All want to stand and fight for different reasons. I'm amazed a small RPG maker game managed to make those tiny characters so interesting, funny and attaching.\n\nAbout the combats, those characters are indeed weak but fear not, you'll be able to call the 'heroes' for help - if they do indulge to respond lol! For this part you'll have to juggle with a very limited number of loot (healing potions included) and a limited number of heroes calls. At first the learning curve is a bit stiff but you'll be satisfied as your NPC characters will slowly grow stronger and be able to fight on their own. You'll also find equipement and upgrades but be careful as the upgrades parts are very limited. So what I first thought out to be a casual RPG game turned out to be very interesting, rather challenging and kept me on the edge of my seat. i.e. nothing more satifying than managing to take out 3 huge rats all on your own when you play a tiny weak goblin!\n\nThe story is divided in 8 chapters, 3 (IIRC) of them are only a small narrative sequence. The 5 playable chapters are quite long, requiring an hour each. The story have all the usual classic dramatic clichés from J-RPGs: Evil Emperor taking over the world, world which is 'dying' and slowly collapsing etc. But it's sprinkled with a ton of humor: funny item descriptions, heroes with an attitude, funny dialogues, small details everywhere... I really liked it! It's a perfect balance for a second degree narration: a spoof of RPGs with a challenging gameplay.\n\nYou can replay any chapters whenever you want to make better scores to unlock a couple of stuff - like heroes to cast during combats. Some chapters features mazes so you'll have to be patient and cautious. There's a zone with puzzles. There's also some achievements to make and secrets to find and you'll have to replay the previous chapters to unlock all the secrets..  So the gameplay never gets dull. And you can play with your XBox Controller (very important point to me). Be warned that the game gets very hard toward the end but this makes winning the game even sweeter! My Playthrough lasted 9 hours and I still have a couple of achievements to make that should add a couple of hours (at least), so the game length is very decent.\n\nThe game quickly grows on you and it's hard to put down - you want to see what comes next. Really, this game is a small gem... Don't miss it!","December 21, 2015","true","9.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

The story starts in a creepy manner, wherein heroes fall to the "Emperor" and gets obliterated (one of them got literally obliterated). Then as the story progresses, it is followed by well-executed humor.\n\nGraphics: Downright RPGMaker finish on the graphics. Nothing awfully bad, but nothing awfully good either.\n\nAudio: The BGMs and the SFX fit in each of the events. Pretty much an average finish.\n\n[NOTE!] As of the time this review was posted, I had a game breaking bug wherein when I launched the game, the menu screen lags terribly with no inputs being accepted by the game, yet the BGM and the confirmation beeps when the game starts are still there. A PC restart did nothing to solve it, but a full reinstall is the only solution that worked for me. I'm also not sure if this scenario is only on my part, since the computer that this was installed is only of entry-level specification.\n\n\nVerdict: 7/10 as of now. Would be much higher if this bug will be resolved in the future.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/auxkom/recommended/421810/","auxkom","Auxkom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/auxkom/","22 products in account","OH! RPG! tells the story of a group of heroes after failing their quest to save the world, travelling through the game world back to their home places to experience the end of the world with their relatives and loved ones. You as the player will, however, not play as the heroes themselves, as their story has already been written. Instead, you take the role of various NPCs they encounter, which have their own business in mind. With each chapter you will take control over a different person in that game world. The story after the failure of the heroes is pretty much what you'd expect, without big surprises or twists. It gets close to being an actually sad tale, but it ultimately failed to draw me in at the end. I was pretty much left there with a huge question mark over my head before realizing that's all what I'd get.\n\nWith that in mind, you will never play, level up and equip a character more than for maybe an hour before losing your progress and switching on the next one. It feels very dissatisfying that you only level up, gear up and learn those skills just to face a boss monster 30 minutes later and after defeating it, to start all over on a new character, in a new area, with a new story, and a new boss monster.\n\nThe graphics are pleasing, even though at some parts of the game my frame rate dropped to around 5 for a few seconds. The sprites are very well done, the skill effects are cool and the soundtrack is particulary great. It fully manages to create the atmosphere it needs for certain areas, like a dark, demon-posessed forest.\n\nI have mixed feelings about the gameplay. For one, the combat mechanics are well done. You can upgrade your equipment and your potions to make them stronger. The RPG elements and character progression are there and feel very real, but this is the crucial thing I dislike about OH! RPG!: They aren't. Nothing you do is persistent. Potions and upgrade materials are very limited and are heavily required to face the chapters' various bosses, thus creating a very linear experience in a game of a genre that's actually known for player's freedom. There are no shops in the game, so you gotta stick to what you find in treasure chests.\nThe essence of an RPG is to become stronger, to develop the character in a certain way, but these mechanics have no real meaning in OH! RPG!. Ironic for a game whose name consists for more than 50% of the term "RPG".\n\nThe boss battles are also slightly flawed. The spirtes look cool, and the music is fantastic, no doubt, but some bosses (Yeah I'm looking at you, phoenix) are really tough. Not because the bosses are strong, but because some of them heavily rely on RNG, therefore at certain situations there is nothing you can really do but hope for the boss to not permanently lock you in a stun, blind or other CC while dishing out damage.\n\n\nOverall I enjoyed my time with OH! RPG!. The gameplay is flawed but otherwise well done, the story is interesting (not amazing but good enough to keep you interested), the soundtrack is amazing and the controls are very good, supporting both mouse and keyboard inputs. For three bucks it's definitely worth it, if you're not too much into meaningful character progress.\n\nBut if I say it's definitely worth it, why is this review negative then? I mean, the overall presentation is pleasing at the end, but I am extremely disappointed that every chapter turned out to be a temporary experience.\nOH! RPG! has good RPG mechanics, but it doesn't utilize them at all. It's not feeling like an RPG, and most importantly, what makes me sad about this is the fact that it could have been (excuse me) ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. It had such a great potential, but in my opinion it's wasted.\n\nIf the developer decides to make a prequel in which you can stick to your characters throughout the story instead of just one or two levels, I'd instantly get it, because this game shows some great qualities.","February 17","false","6.3"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","20","28","0","0"

RPG! provides an appeal of its own as well. While it uses a basic RPG combat system, complexity comes from the fact that you have limited resources to work with and battles are generally not in your favor. For the most part, you control only a single character at a time and have to plan your fights around that point. Additionally, there is notable importance placed on the "Hero Call" system, which lets you summon the heroes to complement your own actions. Since they take a few turns to show up and the number of times you can use them is sometimes limited, correctly timing these calls (as well as choosing the correct ability for the hero to use) can be crucial to your success. At the end of each chapter, you are scored based on your performance, which unlocks useful bonuses. There are also a number of fun sidequests and secrets to be found which give the game more longevity.\n\nAdmittedly, OH! RPG! is not without its issues. The difficulty of the battles can be overwhelming at times if you slip up, some areas are overly labyrinthine, and the puzzles are occasionally confusing. However, these can also be seen as positives for a player who likes a decent challenge, and the game is certainly fair about it - you can save anywhere and lower the difficulty level if you want, and you don't have to worry about random encounters. All in all, I find this game easy to recommend to anyone who likes RPGs and is in the mood to try something that is both a little different and a little familiar.\n\nNOTE: I am required by Valve to state that I received a free key for this game from the developer for the purpose of beta testing.","December 11, 2015","true","8.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

So I decided to go ahead and scrap my previous review in favor of this new one.  XD\n\nBasically, OH!  RPG!  is a (you guessed it) a RPG based game.  Now you may be thinking that it's like all those other RPG games made with RPG Maker although this particular game has interesting twists that make it stand out.  First off, there's the story.  In most RPGs, you have the hero who goes off on a quest to save the world and has to recruit other heroes along the way to help defeat the ultimate boss.  However, in OH!  RPG!, the idea is to imagine what would happen if the heroes fought in the final battle and lost.  What happens then?  Here is where the NPCs come in to help the heroes and face the aftermath.  I like this concept of the NPCs (who normally wouldn't be involved in actual fighting in standard RPGs).  The NPCs range from a goblin who served under the Emperor (ultimate enemy) to a court jester.  I found each stage to be interesting in that I could play as a different NPC so it made the gameplay interesting.\n\nSecond, I like the gameplay here.  Of course, there's the usual exploration, side quests, and battles but in the battles, as you play a NPC, you have to fight the enemies by yourself.  However, you can use this feature called "hero call" (something like that) if you need a hero's help.  It is possible to defeat the enemies without relying on the heroes although it makes things more challenging that way.  Also, you can upgrade items, weapons, and armor pieces, a feature that isn't a standard in many RPGs.\n\nThird, there is the feature called a user rank system.  After you complete a stage, your user rank is calculated based on factors such as how much gold and experience you earned and whether you relied on the heroes in battles and such.  Advancing in rank will earn you certain rewards in the game and you actually do need most of these rewards to earn all of the possible Steam achievements.  (Oh and I should note that you can replay a stage once you clear it.  I would have liked for there to have been a New Game+ feature like in Sweet Lily Dreams and Whisper of a Rose but I suppose I'm just used to it.)\n\nAs for negative points, one I did find is that the game would load slowly at times when advancing from one stage to the next.  Now I believe that's because of this particular RPG Maker engine and not due to the game itself.  When I first played the beta, the loading was much worse so it has considerably improved since then.  I still think it could be tweaked further but that's a personal preference more than anything.  Also, I have mixed opinions on the puzzles.  I'm usually a fan of them since I think they provide a nice break from the usual battles and all.  However, I think there could have been fewer of them and perhaps have been made slightly easier.  (Or maybe, there could be a difficulty range system implemented in the future where the player could decide how difficult they want the puzzles to be or even opt not to have them at all.  Just a thought to put out there.)\n\nOverall, though, I do think this game was pretty good and interesting.  For the price, there is plenty of gameplay so I do think it's worth purchasing if you're a fan of RPGs.  ^^","December 25, 2015","true","18.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

It begins with 4 heroes Harold, Therese, Marsha and Lucius in a  battle with the Demon King where they are all defeated with a spell.  Gobby , the Goblin, helps 3 other heroes which each have special skills to travel  through the maze to fight other bosses. They collect potions, fragments, armor, and gain experience to travel through 8 levels and defeat many other overlords. It takes strategy to use everyone's capabilities to get the best advantage in battles. It has a save feature , you can use keyboard or controller and keeps you busy with the character conversation.  I'm on the second map, but I need to find my way out to the next map or previous level. I saved it and will try again!

As I played through the game, I noticed different details that made it more amusing. For instance, as the story progresses, the characters you play actually go down in level.  The puzzles weren't hard, but required a bit of thought.  The various boss battles can definitely be a bit frustrating and require several restarts (fortunately, there is a Retry option which tosses you right back into the battle), but once you figure out the mechanics, all are definitely doable.  The soundtrack is very nice. The developer is active in forums and quickly pushing out bugfixes and updates.  +1 for controller support. That's always a plus in my book.","December 14, 2015","true","10.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

I have seen some interesting things such as upgradeable potions, you can upgrade the potions so that they are more effective by the cost of some materials.\n\nAbout the story I can't say much because as aforemetioned I didn't have the time to play enough but as far as I have seen it has kept me hooked, the beggining is quite intense and the action starts from the first frame. If you didn't read the description here you have a short summary: Usually the story is written by the winner but this game doesn't focus on them but on the ones that failed. Instead of being the hero you are the NPCs that help the heroes.\n\nThe engine used is the same as the previous titles: RPG Maker.

I got a key to test the game and i had a really fun time with it.\n\nWhat would happen if the heroes of the story lose the final battle to save the world? what would people think about them? that's the premise of this story, with a little twist. Instead of controlling the heroes the main characters will be what you would call the "extras" in any other game. They will help the heroes return to their home to see the end of the world with their family and friends.\n\nThe game is divided into 8 chapters (although 3 of them are only cutscenes) and you will control 1 different character on each one. And like i said you will not control the heroes, but you can summon them on combat to help you with different skills.\n\nOn every chapter you will find a mix of exploration, combat, side quests and some puzzles (some of them are really tricky). Combat wise you will need to master the "call" function, knowing when to summon the heroes and for what. And at the end of each chapter you will get points depending on how you finished it, that will reward you with some perks to help you along the way.\n\nI found the art really nice and like every game from RosePortal music is really good, specially the songs used in combat.\n\nSo in the end i can say that the game is really fun (also a little hard sometimes), and although the game is not long completing ranks, side quests and getting all achievements will take you a while.\n\nIf you like RPG Maker games give it a try, for that price i don't think you're gonna lose much.","December 12, 2015","true","18.6"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

Steam really should've add an option to "Wait Until Further Updates" though.\n\nPros:\n+ Made using RPG Maker MV, meaning engine, SFX, and graphics should be better than most RPG Maker VX-made games.\n+ Interesting "Hero Call" ability\n\nCons:\n- Plot isn't explained very well in the beginning.\n- Still bug ridden at the moment\n\nThese might be the bugs that I've noticed by far:\n- Pressing the TAB button freezes the game, to unfreeze it, you have to Alt+TAB, then go back to the game. This renders the Steam Overlay unopen-able.\n- After obtaining the fourth cloak, the game crashes with the message "Error Initialising Steam API". Probably related to the bug above.","December 11, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's interesting seeing how it makes you strategize, since you play as the NPCs instead of the heroes.  I think that this actually does a better job of representing the ideal JRPG gameplay than many JRPGs, since you can't just be a super-powered hero and smash everything without a thought.\n\nIf you want the joys of playing a JRPG without wanting to commit to starting another epic journey, or if you're intrigued by the reversed plot of playing NPCs, then this is the game for you.","December 11, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This does not affect my opinion of the game.\n\nOH! RPG! is a short casual RPG game like the classic JRPGs like Final Fantasy.  Unlike the usual story where the heroes save the world from evil, instead the story goes on to what would happen to the heroes after getting defeated by the evil boss and they are forced to run away and seeing the aftermath of their failures.\n\nThe game takes a new twist that you play the roles of the NPCs that the heroes encounter while returning home.  The game is divided in chapters and you play different NPCs that the heroes encounter on their journey home.\n\nOverall, this game has good story so far (I am only half-way into the game) and a great BGM.  Being a casual RPG game, battles are limited therefore not grindy and challenging.  It does have some interesting puzzles to solve to proceed  and there's a replay value if you decide to get a higher rank to unlock more features and one of them is for unlocking an additional boss battle.\n\nUnfortunately being a new engine, the game lags a little during the initial startup.  I am assuming the cause it's pre-loading the game assets.  Other than that, it's very enjoyable and a very low cost game.","December 11, 2015","true","8.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You will get my honest feelings about the game (both good and bad).---\n\nWe start out with our 4 heroes Harold, Therese, Marsha and Lucius in a boss battle where one of them is not lucky enough to pull through?!?! To start, the player takes the role of Gobby the Goblin and decides he wants to help the 3 remaining heroes out of the castle to safety. This begins the 8 chapter quest in OH! RPG! Gobby battles alone but is able to call on the heroes to help him with powerful spells along the way. As the game progresses you take on the roles of other characters to help the heroes along. I don't really need to tell you all about the features as the "about this game" section tells you all you need to know.\n\nI didn't run into any crashes during my time playing but there were several updates to the game in the days leading to release. This means the developer is still working hard to squash any bugs as they are found. The price for what you get here is phenomenal and even better with the 40% discount at time of release. Controller support, achievements and trading cards are all great and although there is no cloud save it does have an auto save feature in the game.\n\nI can't really think of anything bad about this game other than the lack of video options (either full screen or windowed mode) and lack of multiplayer. For the price, you really can't go wrong here folks. Great idea and a great all around game.","December 11, 2015","true","5.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

This game is an improvement in it uses RPG Maker MV which seems to run much better (and better resolutions than VX Ace and before).  I've completed the first two chapters.\n\nPros:\n- Improved Battle System.  I like the call system where you can call other heroes for chapter 1.\n- Chapter based system that changes characters.  While the story felt slightly rushed (from chapter 1 to 2) I like how it transitions from chapter 1 characters to the chapter 2 character.\n- A different take on heroes which is cool and each chapter having different character's to play as.\n\nNeutral:\n- No World Map (which most people don't mind.  I love world maps).\n- Crafting System:  I like the system but having to unequip weapons/armor to upgrade them is a little annoying.  Otherwise I like how you can upgrade potions, which is quite unique.\n\nCons:\n- The story could be fleshed out a bit more (at least Chapter 1).  I like a lot of information.

This was the first time I saw an RPGmaker game that I was eager to play. Sadly my eagerness turned to disappointment. The game failed to launch several times. I read up on the issue and found out I needed to turn off the Steam overlay. So I did and it finally launched.\n\nThe game looked nice and the story started in an interesting point, right after failing to save the world. As I was escaping I noted the game was becoming laggy. It quickly got to the point that I was getting frustrated.\n\nI read up on the game and found lag was a common problem. The responses I saw boiled down to two things. "Your computer is too old" and "You must have old drivers, update your drivers".\n\nWhile the game may work for some, it is obvious that it still has some basic mechanical bugs. Perhaps one day they’ll be fixed and I'll try and play the game again.\n","February 18","false","0.2"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","9","18","2","0"

RPG! is a turn-based RPG made by developer RosePortal Games in RPG Maker MV.\n\nThe game starts right where a typical RPG game would end, at the epic battle featuring the\nheroes versus the final boss. The player is then presented with a very interesting premise; this time the heroes are defeated and forced to run away knowing that the world will end because of their failure.\n\nIn this game the player does not play as the heroes themselves, but as the various NPC that they encounter throughout their shameful journey back home. The game is composed of eight chapters, each of them starred by a different character and with a different style.\n\nScenarios are colourful, varied and well designed, and the music adapts well to the situations presented.\n\nAs for the gameplay, the game is basically a standard old-school RPG game, with turn-based battles, weapons and armor the player can find and equip and usable items such as healing potions.\n\nEven though the heroes will not always be present in the party,  providing they are nearby the controllable character can use their skills in battle... The player must keep in mind, however, that these special attacks take some turns to activate, and that using them too much will result in a lower User rank at the end of the chapter.\n\nThe game presents an interesting crafting system that allows for items and equipment to be greatly upgraded directly through the menu.\n\nAll in all, the game is fun and entertaining, and I believe it to be worth playing. I would recommend it to fans of old-school RPG games and to anyone that finds the game's premise intriguing.\n\nDisclaimer: I was given a free key for this game in exchange for a review, but I was not compelled to leave a positive one. The above is my honest opinion.","December 11, 2015","true","8.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The final boss in the adventure, and the destiny of the realm rests in your ability to vanquish him. But unfortunately you fail and the world is going to get destroyed. Now you have to escape him and make it in time to watch the end of the world with your loved ones.\n\nThat´s the starting point of this adventure. You have to help the jer.. heores get back to their homes and loved ones using the help of NPCs, quite different ones depending on the stage you are in. Some of them include a goblin, an old lady or a nun, to name a few.\n\nThese stages have a strong strategy component. Your characters start with a predetermined level and have to beat\nmostly all enemies during the stage, along with the smart use of the Hero calls during fights, to be able to get a chance to finish the stage boss and get a good rank (if you aren´t playing on easy mode, that is).\n\nWhich brings us to the User Ranks. This feature activates at the end of the stage and gives you a certain amount of points depending on difficulty, exp and gold earned. These ranks unlock certain helps and extras that makes the game easier and replayable, like the "don Miguel" and Mapping Tools, that makes you revisit stages to find secrets that you couldn´t unlock the first time you played those stages.\n\nAll in all, a great, funny game that may be not that long (it´s, in words of the developers, 4 hours long), but with a great replay value. By the time i´m writing this review, i´ve clocked 18 hours and i´ve yet to unlock all the little secrets this game has to offer.

I have not been compelled to leave positive feedback and have judged this game by my own standards.\n\n\nOH! RPG! is a game that starts where other games would usually end- with the heroic party being defeated by the final boss. This is usually where you'd enjoy a Bad End with credits or at least reload and try again- but these heroes just have to live with it and accept the help of an unlikely source... but you're the unlikely source and the heroes are mechanically just sporadic 'summons' who might be around to help you help them out- or once you switch perspectives, they're just around while you're doing something important to your new character. You get to play as what would normally be NPCs, to sum it up, in an RPG universe where the world is pretty much coming to an end. Surprisingly, it's less dour than that sounds like it should be.\nI write this review having completed the first section of the game and having dug into the second section. Take note that even on Easy Mode, I find that I can't just sleepwalk my way through the game. It's not impossible-hard, but I would say that you probably should have some sort of background in turn-based RPGs because the game doesn't hand-hold much past the first section. As far as I can tell, due to the episodic nature of the sections of the game, you can't and won't be level-grinding and you have to deal with whatever items you can find, as well as deciding what items to improve with the crafting items you find along the way.\nOverall, I would recommend the game to anyone who likes turn-based RPGs and is interested by the quirk of the game. Even though the sections seem like they will be fairly short and will probably continue to be- I liked playing the game from the differing perspectives and had at least some small interest even in the first character I played as.","December 11, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So it is either upgrade the starting weapon or the only other weapon you will have with that toon. (just a real missed oppertunity here)\nThe game offers little in the way of comfotable difficulty, your weapon is either severly under/ over leved. you start each area with a low level weapon that makes fighting nearly impossible. then you eventaullay find a weapon (the only other weapon) that is so overleved you a briskly defeating each enemy. there is nothing in between.\nGame has no map ( I would have been happy even with a mini map)\nThe user level that you get for defeating each area is never explained\nThere are side quest but you have no idea what they are.

Everything does wads of damage to you, and it seems like the game expects you to rely on the heros, but more often then not, summoning them leads to being insulted at your own lack of ability, having them halfass their own skill, and leaving you no better off than before.

But regardless of anything, I will still review it as any other game I play. So:\n\nOH! RPG is one of the many RPGs out there made in the RPG Makers series. Thus, it gets the RPG potential of such a game. But it takes another route instead of the standard routine RPGs take. It takes a good question like : "What if the Hero Party managed to reach the final Boss - The Great Demon Lord or just The Dark Lord of the game - but instead of winning they ended up losing?" and without commensing with all their adventure at all or spawning a GAME OVER screen, it plays around minor characters and sometimes enemies who change sides to help or who are in need of help and that is what we get to control! To me that is a magnificent mechanic. But it is not all about the game yet.\n\nThe game itself needs caution in every way possible. Whatever you do, do it quickly and think about it. The game is played in missions with ratings which is also a nice touch. The controversial Hero Support that may or may not exist or even break down to be just a minor assist once is a good challenge for any player. Since we got around here and in order for this not to go too lengthy let me start listing the Pros and the Cons.\n\nPros (+)\n+ A prototype and inovative idea.\n+ Nice music.\n+ Nice sprites.\n+ Smart made skills.\n+ Equipment/Item Upgrades.\n+ It is an RPG - which for me is more than good enough as a +.\n+ Its side quests are tricky to complete.\n+ It needs you to use your brain far more than you think you need.\n+ Your choice is everything in order to avoid GAME OVER.\n\nCons (-)\n- A player not familiar with RPGs will not enjoy the game quickly enough.\n- Brutish players will have to think. ( :P )\n- If you make a choice which at the time seems right but is wrong in the end, you are pretty much screwed. (Yes, especially in the Old Lady one)\n- If you do not manage your saves right, it might be a GAME OVER as well.\n\nOverall\nIt is an excellent game following a much smarter route rather than blindly going into an RPG. It gives a nice feeling off by letting the player follow storylines besides the main one. And it requires a lot more attention to details so it is a lot more challenging. If I had to rate it from 0 - 100 then I'd give it a 90 out of 100. The last 10% making it a MUST HAVE would be if it had all the regular storyline with the heros and then after the end of the main story giving you this set of missions. Making a double storyline and giving you the excitement of both playing the heroes and then everyone after they fail. How awesome would that be? :P","December 11, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

But, the story is just too rushed, everything's happening so sudden, and the characters as heroes are not even interested in anything - spoilers - like, really, anything, not even saying something more to their dead friend after they see his ghost, not even in the beginning after he is been blown to shreads. - end spoilers - What I also found really outrageous though, is the gameplay and specifically the battle system.\n\nIt's very bad and awful as a playstyle, the heroes are kinda never in your party, you play as random commoners who just happen to be there in the worst time, whenever you try to call for help with the magic command, the heroes sometimes just don't do whatever you asked and being waiting for in the turns, instead, they sometimes do something else, entirely useless, or they won't bother to help at all. The game expects you to lose and try again and again to win the battle with your wits, pushing and frustrating you.\n\nI don't know what everyone is finding in this game, I've played it for a while believing the best things, I gave up after I played a little with the Old Lady. If you like something old school classic and want to spend money on it, try an F.F. series or something else, anything but this game.","May 2","false","1.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

It's overused, but it's in the tag list, so I know what I get. The engine doesn't matter when the game is made with love.\n\nI don't mind that you re-use all of the default assets in RPGMaker. Maybe you have a good story to tell and you don't have the budget for a graphic artist, unlike fellow RPGMaker game The Amber Throne. That's okay. Making games is hard and sometimes not very rewarding, so you want to limit your losses whenever you can.\n\nI don't mind too much when you don't do the extra effort of making the game work fine on modern computers and monitors, like, a bigger window. There are scripts for that, but I suppose your laziness isn't a mortal sin.\n\nBut I do mind when in addition to these, you start taking the banner used for RPGMaker MV as the basis for your own logo and splash screen... Including its ugly font, for crying out loud!\nIf it's not part of the assets licensed away to you, then it's called theft. I don't need to know the rest. All I see is that you release game after game, never taking time to give them a proper identity. Is this one a good game? I don't know, would you rather watch Iron Man or a cheap rip-off like Metal Man?\n\nI don't buy from thieves. But I felt a need to represent gamers with a conscience and post this review, so I got a key through a cheap trade and made my money back through card farming.\n\nI only support people who recognize their errors and make amends to those they wronged. You can still do it later I suppose, but you won't mean it, so either way you win yourself a negative review.\n\n(More reading: https://steamcommunity.com/app/421810/discussions/0/485624149153869132/)","February 2","false","3.8"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","11","27","2","15"

RPG! is an enjoyable game with an interesting prospect: to see what happens when the heroes lose, and how the "background characters", or "NPCs", live through it.\n\nStory: interesting, funny at time, although rather conventional overall. The characters are not one-dimensional, without having particularly deep personalities either. They mostly shine thanks to the unusual focus the game offers. I found the ending to be particularly underwhelming, and was disappointed when I discovered that there is no "true" or "alternate" ending to be found in the current game, but that it might instead come as a DLC.\n\nGameplay: there are clear efforts made in order to offer an interesting and challenging gameplay, by letting you adjust difficulty for yourself by calling or not the heroes to assist you, and by giving key encounters puzzly twists. Most times, it works, sometimes, it does not.\nThe last chapter of the game is where it all comes crashing down, for the most part, because of RNG.\nIn one particular encounter, you are expected to debuff your massively overpowered oponent in order to survive their attacks. Unfortunately, you have no control on what he uses against you, and when, and he also tends to act before you. The result? If you are unlucky, the fight is over before you could take even one single action, and the odds are high enough that it can happen several times in a row.\n\nPerformance: abysmal.\nThe game lags on more than one occasion, starting with the title screen itself! There are also loading times lasting between 3 to 5 seconds between maps, although it only started to occur for me past the first stage. Other than that, a few frustrating bugs, including crashes and lockdowns, happened a few times while I was playing, but the last update seems to have fixed that. However, the lag and loading time issues remain.\nThe fault most likely lies in large parts on RPG Maker MV's engine itself, which seems poorly optimized and capricious in general. That's why I don't hold the peformance issues against the game like I would if the developers had a hand in the engine. RPG Maker MV is supposed to allow one to create games without having to tinker with the engine itself, therefore, while those performances issues are unacceptable, I lay the blame on Kadokawa, not RosePortal Games.\n\nNow that the most critical issues have been patched, I do recommend this game, especially considering its low price, but be warned of the performance issues, and odd balancing which is the result of mixing together puzzle-combat and RNG without the ability to grind nor the consessions on difficulty you usually see in JRPGs.","December 13, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","12"

It's a short game, and yet has several moments where it's way too cryptic. Not to mention that the game still has many bugs that are to be fixed (to be fair, of course, they ARE getting fixed).\n\nSo why on Earth do I recommend this?\n\nThe game's concept is fantastic. The story starts out with the heroes failing to save the world, and the story focuses on different characters as the world comes to an end. This is actually a really great idea. The gameplay itself, which (usually) focuses on one character at a time. Your given a system where armor and even potions get upgraded. And this works very well. There's five chunks in the game, each focusing on another character who crosses paths with the "heroes" that failed to save the world. There's enough differences between the characters and their story to keep things interesting (even the best way to upgrade your character will vary depending on who you are controlling), and each chunk is small and repeatable, so a mistake you make won't be plaguing you for the rest of the game (but there are rewards for doing well, so there's still incentive for upgrading well).\n\nThis is not a great game, but it is a good game with great, interesting concepts. If nothing else, it's challenging me to see if I can come up with unique ideas of my own. It's cheap too, so, yeah. It's worth a few hours and a few bucks.","December 27, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also don't play with the heroes, which is kinda weird for an RPG, but the ways the fighting system works in each chapter and how different it is made the game pretty entertaining.

RPG! is an enjoyable game with an interesting prospect: to see what happens when the heroes lose, and how the "background characters", or "NPCs", live through it.\n\nStory: interesting, funny at time, although rather conventional overall. The characters are not one-dimensional, without having particularly deep personalities either. They mostly shine thanks to the unusual focus the game offers. I found the ending to be particularly underwhelming, and was disappointed when I discovered that there is no "true" or "alternate" ending to be found in the current game, but that it might instead come as a DLC.\n\nGameplay: there are clear efforts made in order to offer an interesting and challenging gameplay, by letting you adjust difficulty for yourself by calling or not the heroes to assist you, and by giving key encounters puzzly twists. Most times, it works, sometimes, it does not.\nThe last chapter of the game is where it all comes crashing down, for the most part, because of RNG.\nIn one particular encounter, you are expected to debuff your massively overpowered oponent in order to survive their attacks. Unfortunately, you have no control on what he uses against you, and when, and he also tends to act before you. The result? If you are unlucky, the fight is over before you could take even one single action, and the odds are high enough that it can happen several times in a row.\n\nPerformance: abysmal.\nThe game lags on more than one occasion, starting with the title screen itself! There are also loading times lasting between 3 to 5 seconds between maps, although it only started to occur for me past the first stage. Other than that, a few frustrating bugs, including crashes and lockdowns, happened a few times while I was playing, but the last update seems to have fixed that. However, the lag and loading time issues remain.\nThe fault most likely lies in large parts on RPG Maker MV's engine itself, which seems poorly optimized and capricious in general. That's why I don't hold the peformance issues against the game like I would if the developers had a hand in the engine. RPG Maker MV is supposed to allow one to create games without having to tinker with the engine itself, therefore, while those performances issues are unacceptable, I lay the blame on Kadokawa, not RosePortal Games.\n\nNow that the most critical issues have been patched, I do recommend this game, especially considering its low price, but be warned of the performance issues, and odd balancing which is the result of mixing together puzzle-combat and RNG without the ability to grind nor the consessions on difficulty you usually see in JRPGs.","December 13, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","12"

If you're looking for a short RPG that does something a bit new, this isn't bad on a sale price.  I wish it had been longer, though, and less linear.  It was an interesting setting and I liked the idea of playing as NPCs, but the game is very short (4-6 hours if you do 100% completion) and quite linear.  For $1.99 though it's worth checking out if you're tired of the more traditional RPG fare.  I wish there were a "Your Mileage May Vary" category, but overall I do recommend it at least at a sale price.","May 4","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The core gameplay is cool, and the concept is something you probably haven't seen before.  It's rather short for an RPG ( I beat it in 6 hours) however it doesn't overstay it's welcome and presents a decent challenge.\n\nAs long as you aren't looking for a traditional open-world RPG experience, you really can't go wrong with this game, at it's current price. I paid about $1.50 for it but I would have easily paid $5.","May 5","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
