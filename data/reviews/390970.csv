While I don't love it, I don't hate it as well. It's okay-ish.\n\nNow I was intrigued by the concept because of the true story aspect and not to mention some truly messed up stuff happened in Russia ( like the granny killer).  I tried digging around  to find the true story it was based on and my research led me to a web series named Russian Reality. I have no idea what the videos are about since all of them are in Russian, but I believe it's highly controversial ( I'm not entirely sure so don't hate me for this), because of the massive amount of reaction videos.\n\nThe story does have choices you can choose and it affects the story. Now the game has 8 endings in total. 2 of them being good endings and 6 being bad endings. Now the endings end up being normal to incredibly over the top.\n\nThe reason the game is terrible is the horrific English translation. It's the worst translated game I have seen period. The story makes no sense at all, not to mention the entire game the terrible translation will haunt you. Unless you speak Russian and can experience the game in the native language otherwise just don't even bother.\n\nThere's also a really poorly made space shooter, but you rather stay far far away from that. The horrible controls make it really hard to play.\n\nIn the end Russian Horror Story is only for people who speak Russian. If you don't speak it stay far away from this disaster.\n\nUPDATE:\nRecently the developer added an updated translation and guess what ? IT ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE.\n\nIt's amazing that the developer listened to the community and fixed it, but this still has the negative review for the story as it's still very mediocre and not really worth the asking price.\n\nUPDATE 2:\n\nTurns out I was wrong, the developer only fixed the main endings and left a few of the other ones unfixed. So that means only 50% of the game is fixed. Big thanks to virotti for poiting this out.\n\nFinal Rating:\n3/10 - Terrible\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 5","false","3.7"," 111 of 126 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","111","126","5","10"

Still, just barely readable.\n\nLots of ranting, but I'm guessing that's just Russia. At least the whole visual novel really felt like Russia. I get that the protag has mental issues, but in the end I'm left wondering if this was real or if all (or some) of it was in his head. Couldn't tell if it was meant to be realistic or not. It at least still managed to give me some insight on Russian culture.\n\nOST I think is subpar, but does its job putting us in the atmosphere. Atmosphere is one point done well in this game, but it's killed by bits of insanity and, well, the awkward translation. Can't judge original writing quality.\n\nEaster egg (and especially achievements) should be reworked. At least a help popup and proper keyboard controls, and just one not too long and not too easy to get achievement. By the way, both SHIFT buttons let you shoot (and strafe a bit, for some reason), if you're insane enough to aim for the achievements.\n\nOverall: 4/10. Good premice, good ideas, but badly executed. I wouldn't recommend it as is, but consider this as a neutral review.","December 19, 2015","false","4.6"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","1"

Simple decisions, and 5 different endings, beatable in a few minutes. But there's also an "Easteregg" hidden in the PC in the first scene. Click it and you'll find the real horror. Somekind of spaceshooter with horrible controls. Tough you can control the spaceship also with arrowkeys left-right and CTRL for double shoot. But somehow CTRL is linked to the mouseppointer which makes you move towards it. The highest achievement is 1000pts which is barely reachable with those rudimentary controls. Conclusion: the "Easteregg" is unneccessary and pointless for an interesting VN.","April 23","false","2.1"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","18","26","0","0"

The people spoke and the developer delivered in fine form. I can really appreciate that! The story is now fluid and really compels you to read/play on.\n\nBasically, cool story I would assume. You are an average well respected pillar of the community, but you neighbors will test your resolve. You also find out they are plotting to kill you just 1 floor down. This plot can have 8 differnet outcomes to enjoy, and each playthrough lasts about an hour.\n\nA few days ago this game was hampered by a failure to communicate; now it jumps towards the upper eshalon of the visual novel genre.\n\nWorth $6 - (60 Minutes Gameplay X 8 Possible Endings)\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

YES, the English translation is very bad. To the point of being indecipherable at times. However, these jumbled messes add a bit of charm to this game. At times it can be hard to understand certain references if you're not familiar with Russian culture. If you spend a little time you can usually understand the just, of what the translator had intended to say.\n\nNow to move onto what I enjoyed about this game. It does do some very interesting things for all it's faults. The way it potrays the dreary, decaying, atmosphere and seedy characters, makes you think of Moscow itself as the real monster in this horror story. It's obvious your character has very strong feelings for Soviet era. Longing back to what he perceives as the pinnacle of societies. Only to awaken everyday to face a totally alien and modern nightmare. The game uses psychology instead of cheap parlor tricks to create a constant sense of uneasiness. Big budget horror games could actually learn a lesson or two from this rather simple game.\n\nI like the art style but the music is nothing to special. The game is very short as well. I managed to unlock all the endings in about 30 or 40 minutes.\n\nThis game is supposedly based on certain true events. It's hard to tell how much if any of this is true. Although it just kind of adds to the interest an mystery by trying to dig up the real truth.\n\nIf you can get past the translation faults, I would recommend buying this game. Especially if you're looking for something a little more bizarre and unusual than what you'd normally find in a horror visual novel.","November 27, 2015","true","2.7"," 21 of 42 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","21","42","0","0"

I was disappointed. This is not a funny game and not a horror game either. It has no atmosphere, mostly because of the cartoonish graphics, which make you think that it's a comedy game. The story is a collection of stereotypes about russian rednecks, it could have been much more funnier, if they'd shown it at another angle. The only thing I liked is that ending, in which you kill all noisy neighbours and crush their TV with a baseball bat, there's also another ending in which you shoot them with a Makarov.

It follows the miserable life of a man named Ivan as he deals with his downstair neighbours (a voluptuous lady and her child) and all the trouble that it brings him.\n\nThe game features gorgeous hand drawn scenery, an incredible soundtrack that makes the Witcher soundtrack sound like Caillou and an open ended story with incredible choice and consequense. The authors clearly know their english so well that in fact any philosophy in the original(Russian) language translates to english with nothing lost in translation. Bare minimum use of pop culture reference make the player symphatize with Ivan while still keeping his descent into madness as the main star of the story. The only weakness of Russian Horror Story is how short it can be at times, as it leaves players craving for more and more.\n\nRussian Horror Story is a hidden gem worth every penny, and brings every tenants fear into the accessible form of a visual novel.

The characters seem not all too flushed out so far, other than the main protagonist/antagonist (I still can't really tell, only finished one ending).\n\nSomething to keep in mind for those who are looking at this game--is that it is a 'visual novel' certainly not a 'game'.

The translation to english is abhorent, often makes little to no sense, and takes half an hour of the narator complaining about his neighbors. I for some reason played this through, and I really just wished I had killed myself instead.","March 8","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Heart Soul and Body that is this game, can be easily summerized into seven words, yep 7 words and with an accuracy sufficent to squash any room for reasonable doubt..\n\nKeep in mind the amount of playtime I have, Plenty enough to be considered a leading authority on the matter.\n\nPros:\nGame can be Reviewed with 7 words\nWatching half the video and two screenshots on the store page makes you a leading Authority\nScreenshots are sufficient to save people the 63 megabyte hdd/ssd space required to install the game\n\nCons:\nIt was marketed to America\nThe Translation to english based off the 1998 Netscape browser translation algoritham\nGame Reviewers for this game known to be full of shi t sometimes\nAnything and everything else related to this game\n(EDIT) Finding out I have to waste 63mb to install this POS and force 5 minutes of impatience upon myself to write this review\n\n\nAs you can see from the pro's and con's, Its clear as day what could have been done differently by the Devs. But they didn't and I can only draw the conclusion that makes the most sense to me. Which is they're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥,\n\n\nSo to wrap it up, In a nutshell the 7 word review.\n\nOriginally posted by author: ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US","March 5","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
