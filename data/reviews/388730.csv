From the way the sound effects work with the environment to how you open doors this game screams all kinds of suspense while managing to preserve a great flow. I look forward to playing deeper into it soon.\n\nFor what it is I'd say it's worth paying a couple bucks to have it in your collection.\n\nWarning: hard as nails stealth.","July 17, 2015","true","2.6"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","34","39","2","0"

The horror factor was there, although it wore off kinda quickly. I haven't figured out what happens when all of the tarot cards are collected, so there might be some content I haven't seen yet, but I was able to complete the game in just under an hour and a half.\n\nBrighter Day could have been expanded on quite a bit, but it's still a neat little game worth checking out for the price.\n\nEDIT: After collecting all of the tarot cards, there is a bit more depth to the game as it really forces you to explore everywhere, which brings you to some places and things you could easily miss.","July 17, 2015","true","3.8"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","0"

Maybe. I guess. In the same way Sonic the Hedgehog is a horror game for imprisoning cute baby animals inside armed steel caskets and forcing them to kill or in the way that much of Ecco the Dolphin is an extended drowning simulator. It only really horrifies if you linger on the deeper idea of several dozen eyeballs pursuing you around the grounds of a medical facility.\nIt is an entertaining distraction for the asking price. Not a difficult game once you realise that you can sprint and jump past most of the enemies, thereby eliminating the stealth mechanic that it hinges on, but one that at least tries to unnerve you with something besides zombies or ghosts.\nFeel free to check out my run through below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eVYyzrl-Bo","July 19, 2015","true","2.4"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","20","26","8","0"

Not the type of horror game you'd see from time to time, but still it can give you the creeps (I mean like, you're getting stalked by a bunch of eyes, isn't that creepy enough xD). I'd recommend this game to people who want a nice, short and fun (of course) indie horror game.","July 29, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShoeWaver/recommended/388730/","ShoeWaver","ShoeWaver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShoeWaver/","44 products in account","Brighter Day does a great job of breaking the atmosphere of modern day horror games, only if the game did a better job of direction or progress that made itself not another run of the mill horror game.\n\nThe game just drops you into a room with no instructions on what to do or where to go, which seems fitting for the game since there is no dialogue and all the effects in this game seem to be conducted by a MIDI synth. A lot of the designs and interactions with objects in the game are unique and pretty left field and I really enjoyed what it had for that. The game itself however, wasn't enjoyable to me or didn't give me the motivation to really be all that interested in progressing through a lengthy maze portion of the game or to collect all of these tarot cards for what I guess shows a message of some sort. This game would've done better if it did have some sort of explanation on what to do, or at least make itself more interesting with the assets that it had with encountering the eyes that chase you in the game. At times it felt like I was running away from the eyes and couldn't pull off sneaking pass them as much as I  hoped for. This game has some minor bugs, such as the A.I. of the eyes suddenly freezing or dropping to the ground rolling away, but this game just came out and I'm sure the developer will do something about it in the future.\n\nOverall I would not recommend this game to anyone who thinks this would stand out from other horror games, it's just another (but more prettier and intriguing) run-from-monsters horror game with a kick ♥♥♥ sound design at best.\n\nI am looking forward to what Lonliest Pixel has to offer in the future.","July 20, 2015","false","1.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Miraculous.\n\nA bit light on substance but makes up for it by having really obtuse level design that adds extra game hours by making you get lost and dying repeatedly. I think this actually works well for the game because it's conducive to playing out a hopeless life-or-death situation where you are in fact basically f**ked and getting out alive is a miracle.\n\nIt's $3, get it.","August 8, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
