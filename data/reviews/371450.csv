Objective is to fill worlds by placing coloured tiles containing different biomes. New tiles are discovered by highlighting in the correct order and completion of each level comes from maxing out specific groups. Progress further and planets change from rounded objects to more complex shapes and order of tiles becomes much more difficult as well. Colours flash rather then stay lit so it turns into a game of  concentration/memory.\n\nRuns on unity, screen resolutions of 4k+ are supported and controls were all mouse driven. Not sure how many planets Awe contains but for some casual puzzling with a relaxing soundtrack it's hard to go wrong for the price.

Relaxing soundtrack and sound effects, kids friendly for parents to play with their children. Pretty outstanding game considered it was made within 48 hours. Could pass as a FTP title but got that little extra spice that makes it worth it small price, played free apps in a similar style that weren't as good. The simple graphics alike to the leading example Minecraft prove again, a game doesn't need to have the most top up to date graphics to be considered good and fun to play, but that's viewer's perspective.

It's an odd sort of memory game/god game hybrid thing, with a nice ambient soundtrack and an interesting, if low-budget, visual style. It's hard to critique the mechanics, because it doesn't have very many, but the largest issue I see is that it's very, very easy to set up each world so that you can complete any combo the game requires. In essense, this is a nice game to go a bit zen with when listening to podcasts or something, but it's nothing more than that. A pretty thing to do with your hands while focussing on something else. But, it's only 79 pence, so I don't feel I got ripped off, and it's very calming.

It's an emotion one expresses at something that's hard to describe. That's actually a pretty accurate description for this little... thing. It's very cheap. So cheap that you'd be forgiven for thinking it was knocked together off the back of Unity Personal, and it probably was. However unlike most of those sad little products, this one is a diamond in a sea of very brown and stinky sewage. It's not particularly difficult, it's not particularly mechanically challenging, it's not going to blow you away with graphics.\n\n... but it is going to chill you right out.\n\nOhhhh Peter Molyneux, guess what, someone managed with a simple puzzle formula what Godus failed miserably at!\nYou start simply enough, with a slowly spinning planet, a mellow ambient track, and a set of coloured triangles you're supposed to hit. Create those combinations and you're rewarded with new assets to plop down, fill the coloured circles representing those assets and you'll get to move on to the next planet. Slowly and gently you'll end up moving towards more complex reactions requiring three steps, then four, and the chains will become obscured, so you'll have to explore the planet, testing the colours to see what reacts with what.\n\nIt becomes a mellow puzzle, without ever becoming overly challenging, and always offering you the chance to start again. It gives you a very gentle, exploratory, and relaxing experience where nothing you do is really wrong, and you have the chance to create planet designs of your own style, with each planet looking significantly different by virtue of the puzzle layouts from the last.\n\nThe softest soundscape to tickle your ears...\nMarried to this is a gentle, swirling ambient soundscape that never invades, never presses down on you, and will put you at ease with the game, clicking on the planet surfaces and dropping assets will result in soft chimes, and it's quite easy to set up melodic harmonies quite by accident when you're creating reactions. You wind up smiling as you're working your way through the planet as you hear these gentle, encouraging chimes as the planets become more and more colourful.\n\nClosing thoughts...\nConsidering the price point? This is a no brainer to recommend to people who are interested in relaxing puzzlers. It's not going to stretch the gray matter, but if you need something that's going to help you wind down after a hard day of gaming? This is the gaming equivalent of a glass of red wine.\n\nVerdict : Recommended - Specifically to people in need of something relaxing.\n\nWriter and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/commissarbro/recommended/371450/","commissarbro","CommissarBRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/commissarbro/","1034 products in account","As most would probably agree, this isn't really what one would consider a God-Game like Black & White, From Dust or Populous. It's more of a relaxing, simplistic terraforming puzzle game. Essentially, you have a planet of varying dimension and size that rotates very slowly. By clicking on the color of the ground, you match it with the combinations on the left of the screen to unlock more terraforming features (for example a forest or a mountain). Placing a mountain or a forest requires the ingame resource, AWE, which you stockpile by matching additional color types. For example, I've unlocked forest by clicking brown land types and blue land types but I don't have enough Awe to place it. Now I must gather awe by clicking brown, brown, blue, blue etc etc. It's all very simple and surprisingly addictive and with the incredibly mellow music playing in the background, you will easily slide into this game feeling relaxed and unpressured. Keep in mind, you don't want to terraform all the spaces on a planet until you unlock all of the terraforming features... otherwise, you'll have to start over.\nSummed up, this game is totally worth a dollar just for the peaceful experience alone. Definitely recommended.\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNMlEnFb2OA","October 9, 2015","true","3.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","12","12","5","0"

The gameplay however has nothing to do with a god game. It is basically the 'Simon says' segment from Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes with just enough extra mechanics to make it a 99 cents standalone game.\n\nThe gameplay\nYou are given a combinations of colors, and need to press the same colors in the right order on a spinning shape (planet).  This way you earn currency (awe) and unlock new colors (biomes). Pressing the wrong color in a combination does not punish you, but just makes you restart the combination. With the currency you buy the new colors to place on the shape, so you can complete more of the given combinations which require these colors. You complete a level when you have added enough patches of each color and have unlocked and bought an item that does nothing for your current shape.\nAfter the first couple of levels the combinations are not just given, but you need to figure them out. Sometimes they are backwards, flashing or both. This slowly gets a little harder each level but never requires much thinking. If all else fails you can just keep pressing colors until you get a combination right or at least part of it to understand the combination.\nLater a timer (seasons) is added which changes some of the colors on the shape, making the game just a little bit harder.\nThere are 5 chapters (solar systems you can name) with 5 levels (planets you can name) each. Plus the Christmas and Halloween chapters, also 5 levels each. This makes a total of 35 levels, and since later levels are mostly spend waiting for the correct color to pass on the spinning shape this means you can take up to several hours to complete the game.\n\nVerdict\nMy biggest problem with the game is how it is advertised and what it actually offers. The store page promises puzzles, discoveries and a spiritual experience among other things. "The player is a god in a yet-to-be-shaped universe" it says. Unfortunately the reality is that I am just clicking colors in order, and this not why I bought this game. It may be relaxing and fun for others, but I think there is just not enough fun lements to keep you playing if you are not an achievement hunter like me.  The nice presentation can’t hide or fix that…","February 11","false","5.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

The art style and music are pretty simple but do their job  and I really appreciated how each area had its own theme thanks to different tiles and assets.\n\nFor a buck Awe offers some nice and easy-to-learn gameplay backed up by a good amount of content: I heartily recommend it , especially to people that want something uncomplicated and/ or suitable for the whole family, I found it perfect for the early morning/ late night hours when I wanted something to play but was too tired or occupied to fire up complex games.","October 16, 2015","true","4.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The mechanics gradually get slightly more complex and the latter stages of the game require thought and timing.\n\nThere is no form of tutorial and there are no guides so you pretty much have to figure everything out yourself. It's a relaxing experience for the most part until you reach the latter stages at which point frustration can take over a little as sometimes in order to get the right thing in place to progress you have to wait and there's nothing you can do to speed it up. That is my only gripe with the game really because the waiting and watching for the right thing you need is mostly just annoying and not particularly enjoyable. I can see why very few of the people who have played this game have finished it. It does require more patience than a lot of people possess.\n\nIt is very cheap though and if you're not planning on sitting and staring at a polygon sphere for too long then it's a relaxing thing to chill to.","January 21","true","8.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

In this game you tap certain parts of a specific planet in different solar systems to collect certain shapes from them. Once you have collected some shapes in a certain order you will unlock different colored shapes to advance you further into the level. This might sound weird and kind of boring but so does clicking a cookie, and that was extremely addicting to most people who played it. I strongly recommend this game, especially as it is only $1.09.","November 7, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I bought it when it was on sale at one point but I would pay full price happily. It's simple gameplay but satisfying and extremely relaxing. The music is donwtempo and mystical and the gameplay has a very balanced climb of difficulty. Each level that you climb forward adds just the right amount of new challenge. I fully support this game if you're looking for a calming gaming experience to pull out when maybe you've had a long day or if you have anxiety or troubles focusing.","January 1","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You move from planet to planet, trying to maximize your "awe" in order to create foliage (green), landscapes (orange), ore (yellow), satellites (gray), and a wonder that serves as a sort of crown on to be placed on each finished planet. In order to unlock each of the various panel colors, you must press them in different orders (blue, green, green). This is more or less difficult by where on the planet you've placed your creations, as well as by the speed at which each planet spins. As you play more melodies, you earn more awe, and step-by-step get closer to crowning each planet. Once you've made a preset number of each colored tiles, the planet is considered complete and you move on to the next.\n\nThere's no real challenge to the game, but it's very pretty and relaxing. Worth the one dollar it's going for in store.","April 8","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
