If you aren't combined with any other ships you fire rocket fists. Tons of bullets, real challenge and fun. Only complaint is that until you knock a few of the achievements out of the way they are huge, linger and cover the screen on the right which makes it tough. Still those are one time only nuisances per achievement so I could care less. Great shmup!

Invaders from another dimension in another galaxy have arrived to take over, control, as well as enslave Earth! You, the most heroic man of all time and space, must pilot the Supercharged Robot VULKAISER in order to save existence itself from the greatest threat that could possibly be imagined in forever! Whether you grew up with Voltron, know your Ultramans from your Jet Jaguars, or just enjoy quality 2D shooters, there's something for you in this game.\n\nThis is a horizontally-scrolling shooter, but it's more of a danmaku than Gradius or R-Type. Even though I've been using the word "danmaku" for over a decade, I only just now looked it up. Apparently it means "barrage", and that definitely applies to VULKAISER. The alien armada doesn't mess around, as they'll throw battalion after battalion at you until your health meter is depleted. Yep, this is a shmup with health, and it can even be restored in-between stages. However, you only get one life and no continues. So yeah, you have just one chance to save the world, better make the most of it.\n\nSo how do you handle this situation? With a barrage of your own. The VULKAISER isn't all that effective by itself though. Over the course of each stage you can combine powers with your four best buddies. This results in increased firepower, different weapons, and screen-clearing Omega attacks. The option to swap partners presents itself at various points in the game. Sometimes you'll want a particular weapon for the next area, or the health of your current ally is running low. Yep, everyone has health meters. If they're wiped out, there's nothing you can do for them. Hopefully you can honor their sacrifice by saving the world. This lends a touch of resource management to an otherwise simplistic game.\n\nEach of the six stages offers a good mix of smaller "popcorn" enemies, larger battleships, and a handful of mid-sized cronies. As with any other barrage shooter, you have a hitbox that's much smaller than your actual robot. It's rather odd to get used to, even for someone genre-savvy like myself. You'll adjust to it over-time, and the first two difficulties aren't too bad when it comes to throwing bullets around. The sixth and final stage does present a rather sizable jump in difficulty. In my last play-through on the normal setting, I barely eked out a win, even though I went into it with full health. For the most part though, you're going to be crushing loads of enemies with lots of firepower. It's very satisfying. The 70s aesthetics and music have their appeal as well, though admittedly it's lost on me since I never watched Giant Robot shows (Aside from Robotech but that's more Space Opera).\n\nWith play-throughs lasting just under 20 minutes, this game is on the short side. Much of the replay value is going to come from improving upon high-scores and attempting the harder difficulties. VULKAISER isn't a content-rich game, but neither are most 2D shooters. All that really matters is if a shmup delivers on the fundamentals, and I think this one does. The stages are fairly designed, the bosses are well-done, the controls are solid, and everything functions as it should. Also, I believe the shorter than average length works to this game's benefit. The action is tightly-paced and doesn't suffer from any wasted time.\n\nI highly recommend giving Supercharged Robot VULKAISER a look.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","October 7, 2015","true","5.5"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Venatius/recommended/349680/","Venatius","Venatius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Venatius/","878 products in account","While not a game-changer for the genre, Vulkaiser does enough things competently to be an appreciable scrolling shoot-'em-up. The first, definite eyecatcher is the delightful homage to mecha sentai anime of the 1970s that suffuses the whole thing, from the cheesy intro and theme song all the way down to little details like those yellow subtitles that should be familiar to anyone who's sat down to watch anime in the VHS days. This weakens a little in the actual game, which has some pleasantly goofy but otherwise very unimpressive spritework, including some enemies who emerge from the background, but barely signal their transition into the field of play by simply becoming lighter colored. The projectiles are the usual bullet-hell menagerie, without any particularly interesting patterns or designs. It's a definite low-res affair and not much to look at.\n\nGameplay uses the "charge while firing" mechanic seen in some games like Hellbound, where after firing for a while you fill up a meter (with accompanying audio cue) and can unleash a minor "super" attack. This is initially quite weak. However, the one small novelty is that, in lieu of powerups, you can choose to fuse with one of your four teammates, each giving you an additional secondary fire and upgrading your super attack to something more useful. Each one is meant to have its own situational niche and style, and they do a pretty good job of distinguishing them. As far as I can tell so far, you get your pick of any of the four to start with, but it seems like, thereafter, you can only choose to take or decline a single randomly chosen one at certain fixed points in the subsequent levels. It appears levels give you one pick at the beginning and another shortly before the boss. Functionally it's still a fixed-position powerup system, but it does at least add a little bit of choice in your playstyle and strategy.\n\nAll in all, though it's decent, I'm not strictly sure I could recommend this for shmup fans at large, but those with a fondness for chintzy, hot-blooded old mecha shows might find the style enough to propel this robot into their Steam libraries.","July 30, 2015","true","3.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","2"

As someone who’s watched his fair share of old Japanese cartoons, it really is a well observed little thing. From the slightly cheap looking splash screens, the pompy music, even the loading screens and level title cards, it’s chock full of character. Then there’s the game itself, you’re a giant red robot who can fire his fists like missiles and combine with his co-pilots like Power Rangers.\n\nIt’s not all just for colour either, which pilot you combine with affects your type of attack. Take Rocket Kaiser for example, combine with him and your shots will be accompanied by powerful missiles, with the charged weapon essentially being a huge bomb, great for taking down powerful enemies, but a spread of enemies could easily swarm you. In that case you’d be better off with Needle Kaiser, a wide shot type, but she’s weak both in terms of armour and damage dealt. Drill Kaiser is hugely powerful, but her range is tiny, meaning you’re putting yourself in danger every time you attack. Thunder Kaiser is something of a mix, his standard attack has decent range, his charge shot is powerful, but his bomb is feeble\n\nSupercharged Robot Vulkaiser has a peculiar kind of difficulty, the most notable thing is that it must be beaten on a single credit, there’s no continues to be had. Playing on the easy difficulty I’ve raced to the end of the game, once not even really trying whilst capturing our First Play video. The step up to the next difficulty level though made me hit a wall I’ve struggled to get past. I’m not sure what it is that’s stopping me from getting better at the game, it could just be that I’m not the gamer I used to be. I do sometimes feel a bit blind to the incoming bullets, but no more than any other shooter, but I think it’s actually more to do with the shame of Vulkaiser. Your hitpoint is fairly small, still easy to hit, but only a tiny part of your giant mech, but because you’re essentially controlling a giant line whilst looking at the enemy, it’s very easy to drag it in to incoming fire.\n\nSupercharged Robot Vulkaiser is a little sparse in terms of modes. There’s the story mode and ‘training’, which is just the main missions there for you to retry. I’m not sure Supercharged Robot Vulkaiser is the game to spend hours practising, learning patterns. The training mode does allow you to complete stages though, opening up the next one you couldn’t reach in a single run. It’s not a bad way to see the later levels on the harder difficulties, which at least helps keep things interesting. If you are chasing score then it does separate them by difficulty, and I think the scoring system works by rewarding you for destroying enemies as quickly as possible as they appear on screen, so maybe there is something to be said for spending the time learning patterns.\n\nIn terms of presentation, the game has no resolution options. As soon as you hit play though you’re presented with the option to go full screen, which may seem like a small thing, and does cause some problems on a 2 screen set up, as it merely changes your resolution to match the game’s. It’s welcome though, we’ve reviewed a couple of games in the past year or so that haven’t had that option. One of the drawbacks though, and this is kind of funny if you’re not playing seriously, is it means that when you unlock an achievement, or a friend signs in to Steam, you can’t see a third of the screen. So if you are planning a serious run at the game, maybe turn off notifications.\n\nThere’s no doubting Supercharged Robot Vulkaiser is fun, but a lot of that comes from its charm. It does a great job of harking back to old-school anime, both in tone and theme. I’m less sure the game itself rates as highly or holds up to repeated playthroughs. Which is a shame, I really like the mecha gimmick of combining with the other pilots, and their strengths and weaknesses do add a level of strategy to the game, it’s just a shame the level design doesn’t build on it, instead feeling more like a shooting gallery. Still, for the price it’s a fun bit of nostalgia, hard to dislike, and not something you’ll have seen too often","June 8, 2015","true","2.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

As a big mecha fan I really enjoyed the homages to the different super robots of the 70s with their bright colours and funny looking enemy designs. That being said the game itself is quite short but that doesn't stop it from being fun.\n\nThe game consists of four levels of difficulty and the option of playing the launch mode straight away or practice mode where you can access all six levels and get used to the level before trying it on the launch mode. An interesting feature with this game is that bullets are able to hit your hands and feet without you taking any damage, Vulkaiser's chest is your hitbox and as long as it doesn't hit an enemy blast you won't lose health.\n\nYou have the option to combine with four different types of support units or face the enemies alone with the base Vulkaiser and its rocket fists. Be careful though, if your support unit is destroyed during a stage it cannot be repaired. My personal favorite is the Lightning unit since it can clear mass swarms of enemies and is great for boss fights.\n\nSome things that the game can add to make it better include:\n-A pause button, something that can really help since you're forced to play the whole six levels in one go.\n-An options menu, this is a big one since there's no guide to the control keys. Luckily I played the Satazius demo and learned the keys from that but if I went in blind, I'd be absolutely lost in terms of controls.\n-Additional levels or the choice to choose levels after being defeated. Whilst the game is short it is a bit frustrating to hit the last boss and be forced back to the first level and go through everything again before getting back to the boss.\n\n\nI'm a big mecha fan and if you enjoy side shooters and giant robots then this game is for you. It's short and sweet but something about it makes me want to keep shooting away at hordes of enemy robots and their retro design.","June 9, 2015","true","4.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Bits of mini dialogue have it stand out from your typical side scrolling shooter, and will likely remind you of super giant robot sized mecha anime of the past.\n\nWith variable difficulty from easy to super hard, this game can go from a casual shooter that still challenges to a wicked hard bullet hell that will keep you trying again and again.\n\nWith a price tag of about $5, the game is actually well worth it.

As this game is a mock of the above-mentioned animes.\n\nThe Story is extremely simple, you are a new little guy that got picked up to pilot Earth's strongest robot (70's cliche basic plot).

Challenging even on the easiest difficulty setting, and sometimes punishingly so, given how you only get partial repairs between stages and if a module gets destroyed, it's gone for good.\nFun if you like bullet hell style games and giant robots with the 70s and 80s mix of cheesy, over the top and ludicrous fun, but it suffers from a lack of options. You can't quite pause the game, change resolution (watch out for the huge Steam popups in the corner) or reconfigure the controls, but if you can get past those annoyances, you're in for a treat.\nJust don't expect to clear the whole thing on the first attempt. You have only one life, your robot and modules are quite flimsy, and evasion is the name of the game. Expect the level of ludicrous bullet hell to climb exponentially on the higher difficulties.

WITH YELLOW SUBTITLES!\n\nIt's pretty gawd-dammed perfect as far as what it sets out to do. You shoot all of the the things while bombastic music plays in the background facing a recurring miniboss and so many enemies that are obvious references to the tatsunoko era of anime. It's very self-aware and pretty glorious.\n\nBest of all, there's actually some interesting design choices for the genre, so you'll actually find a different gameplay experience here. Namely in the health system. Rather than being a 1HP hero, you have a fairly meaty health bar, but it carries over from stage to stage and only gets some repairs between stages. Moreover, your co-pilot partners who act as your powerups also have their own, much smaller, health bars and just like in Star Fox they can get KO'd for good if you're too careless through the short 30 minute campaign.\n\nPlus, rather than a whole bunch of bombs in a stage like most shoot 'em ups, you only get one OMEGA BOMB per stage to use when the going gets tough, so strategic deployment of both your team mates and when you pull out your super move is actually fairly critical.\n\nAnd it's all executed flawlessly. Literally the only complaint I have is that the video used to sell the game with the sung VULKAISER themesong isn't actually in the game. If it was it'd be 110% perfect!\n\nAs it is, I'll just settle for 100% perfect.\n\nGo, Go, VULKAISER!

Supercharged Robot Vulkaiser is a short bullet hell shooter that parodies the 70s giant robot anime genre. Vulkaiser only has five levels but it's an addictive game with great presentation and replay value. You take control of the titular Vulkaiser and it's pilot Takuya Akatsuki dodging bullets and blasting waves of enemies as you defend earth from androgynous alien invader General Roz. Vulkaiser can combine with four other vehicles developed by Professor Amamori and piloted by Takuya's allies, each one offering Vulkaiser new attacks, knowing when to choose which unit becomes part of Vulkaiser's strategy as you deal with the varying threats the alien menace poses.\n\nThis is a great indy title from Japanese developer Astro Port and at it's budget price can't afford to be missed, arcade gamers and bullet hell fans alike will love it. definitely pick it up.","October 13, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I guess you have to be quick about not getting hit kind of like a Raiden game.

I'm not even familiar with the anime that this game is based off of, but this is a mechanically amazing space shooter/bullet hell game. You can team up  with your 4 robot companions to add their various weapons to your own base weaponry, but take too much damage while they are equipped and you lose them permanently for that playthrough. It's an arcade style game, so its fairly short. My only complaint with it is that all achievements related to beating the game are currently not working (this includes the achievements for beating it on each difficulty, as well as the one for beating it without using your omega weapon). I'd like to see these achievements fixed but the game itself is great!","July 30, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now that we've gotten the obvious out of the way...\n\nBasically, you're in a mech suit, you fly around a screen, and you shoot lots of lasers, bullets, lightening, and a couple other things at a bunch of other mech suits and spaceships. It's a callback to games like Gradius, where the enemies come in specific waves, ending in a boss battle. Repeat the formula two or three times, and you have yourself an entire level. Repeat that formula a couple dozen times, and you have the game I'm currently reviewing.\n\nThis is not to suggest the game falls short of entertaining. I got it in a Humble Bundle with a dollar donation, so I can't really complain, but it's not often I find something I'll actually play again in the veritable bin of indie games available on humble bundle. This game shakes up combat by offering you an upgrade every so often, which will augment your current robot into something with better weapons, which is cool. Boss designs are pretty interesting, and the music is intense enough to help gameplay, and simple enough to not distract. Controls feel pretty good, and combat feels natural - well, natural if you're a supercharged robot vulkaiser. You could do a lot worse.","August 1, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You don't have to have seen much 70's mecha anime to appreciate the setting and see the humor in it, or to feel the joy of combining with various other modules to grant new attacks to your giant robo.  Each attack is so fun to use in its own way and the dialog between scenes changes depending on whose weapon you beat the boss with, adding to the replayability factor.

Challenging even on the easiest difficulty setting, and sometimes punishingly so, given how you only get partial repairs between stages and if a module gets destroyed, it's gone for good.\nFun if you like bullet hell style games and giant robots with the 70s and 80s mix of cheesy, over the top and ludicrous fun, but it suffers from a lack of options. You can't quite pause the game, change resolution (watch out for the huge Steam popups in the corner) or reconfigure the controls, but if you can get past those annoyances, you're in for a treat.\nJust don't expect to clear the whole thing on the first attempt. You have only one life, your robot and modules are quite flimsy, and evasion is the name of the game. Expect the level of ludicrous bullet hell to climb exponentially on the higher difficulties. Fun, but indubitably with its frustrating moments.","April 4","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
