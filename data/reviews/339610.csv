This game is truly satisfying if you're a competition junky. You don't even have to like sport games to enjoy this game.  The gameplay and game mechanics all work well, untill that point where you hit level 24. As a beginner, I started out playing against other noobs and various pro players that had their smurf accounts in the rookie/major league. I had some epic losses, epic victories, various intense close point games that went into second overtime.\n\nEventually, I managed to get to level 25 with a 76% win percentage overall, I felt like a solid player that played his role ( PF ) well. In good matches, I'd block about every shot, bad matches I'd let a few slide.   All the fun in the game stopped though when I entered the  Pro League.\n\nMatch after match, you get to play against level 50 characters that not only have the most ridiculous skills that you could think, they also have so much experience that not in another 1000 matches could you hope to destroy them. They also have, in almost EVERY case, dropped over 200-300 euros on cash shop roulette style items that grant bonus stats, cards and card upgrades that grant..bonus stats, extra skill slots, etc.  You name it.\n\nSo in quick summary. You might love the game in the beginning, you might think you're a genius rookie player destroying the alt characters of pros. But once you actually get to the pro league, prepare to bend over and take it, over and over again untill you yourself are level 44-50 and have unlocked all the skills + slots. Surely by that time, you would also have dropped atleast 60 euros on the game.","April 9, 2015","false","42.5"," 193 of 246 people (78%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","78","193","246","30","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/channel_onion/recommended/339610/","channel_onion","Oseous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/channel_onion/","47 products in account","Bear with me as this is my first game review on Steam:\n\nPros:\n- Great customization (Skills, Freestyle variability, Clothing, Stat allocation)\n- Requires teamwork (Heavy)\n- Crew matches (Like GvG in MMORPGs)\n- Easy to pick up, Hard to master\n\nCons:\n- Community can be toxic (Will explain more later)\n- You can pay for stats\n- Fluid gameplay relies heavily on latency (ping)\n\nFreestyle2 is a great Multiplayer Online 3v3 Streetball game that pleases my thirst for basketball games.\nIt is very easy to pick up (You only use direction keys + 4 basic keys + 2 or 3 more for specific skills),\nbut hard to master.\n\nIt relies moderately on basketball knowledge, such as actual basketball tactics like Pick and Roll, which can be executed in the right situation. To win, you will have to try your best to fulfill your one of five (C, PF, SF, SG, PG) position's purpose.\n\nPositions and their roles are generalized in FreeStyle2, although adventurous stat allocation may lead to fun and creative plays (like improving 3 pointers success rate on C or PFs).\n\nC: Rebounding and blocking, setting up plays under the paint\nPF: Similar to C, but takes an offensive role\nSF: All-rounder (Dunk, rebound, middle jumper, 3s)\nSG: Also an all-rounder with heavier emphasis on 3s\nPG: Playmaker (Passing and loose ball grabbing)\n\nPlaying the position that fits you and doing it right comes with a great rewarding feeling.\nAlso, there are many team compositions which are strong, but you will run into hell lot of weird ones online (Triple Cs)\n\nIf you aren't good at what your position is supposed to be doing by Major (past level 11), you will most likely be dealt with offensive words, telling you that you suck and that you should quit.\n\nThe playerbase isn't large enough to have the greatest matchmaking system and tiers - and this is why sometimes you will face teams that will totally ♥♥♥♥ on your face. Knowing your position and having individual skills is very important in this game and when a single teammate is not pulling their own weight, it shows definitely.\n\nI highly suggest trying each of the 5 positions before moving onto Major (level 11+)\n\nYou can pay for extra stats (btw you can also do this for free, but not as much).\nDoes it help? Yeah, I guess.\nDoes it win games? Maybe - it makes minimal difference.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nLet's say a player purchased items and also obtained cards to improve his 3 pointers.\nIf you are guarding him perfectly, he won't score any 3 pointers.\nIf you don't and give him open shots on 3s, you should really blame yourself.\n\nTeamwork (Strategy, Individual talent, knowing how each other reacts in certain situations) is much much much much holy freaking so much more important and impactful than stats.\n\nGamekiss will be adding controller support very soon, and I am so excited for that!\n\nGive this game a try. If you like working as a team and enjoy basketball in general, you will love it!","April 8, 2015","true","30.0"," 133 of 171 people (78%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","78","133","171","13","1"

I had like 100+ hours on it creating new accounts to earn 150k points. Bought 500 Gkash for the event.\n\nI was able to feel satisfied with how my character looks and plays. But as soon as I reach level 24. No one would play with you. If there is, they will call you NOOB throughout the whole game. Then use a microphone and harass you throughout.\n\nCommunity sucks! People are jerks~! There are some who would play with you but for the most part everyone is a jerk.\n\nDownfall of this game is how jerks high level people or seasoned people are and it really sets me back.\n\nGoodluck to this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/b_1o1/recommended/339610/","b_1o1","Binh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/b_1o1/","2 products in account","I've been playing Freestyle for 7 long years. Since I was 12 years old, Freestyle has been my favorite game.\nIt has been with me throughout all my teenage years, and I don't regret a thing.\n\nEver since it first came out in 2006 (published by Activision), the game has had issues maintaining a good population due to lack of advertising and support from the foreign developers (JCE).\n\nThat's all hopefully going to change now that it has been released on Steam. It's a shame how we had to wait so many years for this because this is one of the most competitive games in the world.\n\nEverybody who plays this game strives to ultimately be the best, and it's a team game so you have to find 2 other players who share the same mindset as you and want to be the best just as bad as you are.\n\nA lot of this game consists of managing egos of not only your rivals, but your teammates also.\nThere is only one ball in the game of basketball, and scoring is only one part of it.\nYou have to have a good overall team that can not only score, but rebound, defend, block, steal, and pass at the right times.\n\nThis game is all about customization and making your player unique. There is a big item shop in the game that allows you to buy headgear,tops,bottoms, shoes, and accesories to make your baller look unique.\n\nThere are also Freestyles that allow you to change basic animations like dunks and shots so you can turn your simple one handed dunk in to a crazy 360 between the legs dunk!\n\nThen you have your skills. Skills are new animations and upgrades you unlock through leveling your character.\nSkills are the most important part of the game since they give really useful animations like diving for the ball or fading away.\n\nWhen you first start the game and you go in to Rookies, you will be playing versus new players such as yourself who are also learning the game and it will be a cake walk for those who learn faster than others.\n\nBeware though, there is a huge learning curve when you reach the big leagues (PRO Channel).\nPeople do NOT like losing in Pros because it will result in their win % going down and the person that beat you having proof of them beating you.\n\nI was never a guy to make many friends on this game, in fact I made a lot more enemies than I did friends and I am very hated but my advice to you new players is, make some friends before you reach Pros.\n\nTry your hardest to communicate and socialize, post on the forums. MAKE FRIENDS. You do not want to be that "random" "unknown" person in Pros because nobody knows you and you will be kicked out of teams that have good players when you try to join because they simply don't know you.\n\nYou will be stuck on the "Noob Treadmill". That means you will be stuck playing only with players who are really bad and don't care who they play with, and other unknown players like you are which means you will lose A LOT and people will never see you as good.\n\nSo make friends before you get to pros! Get your name out there.\nIf you pick up this game and decide you like it and you're either a PG,PF,or C then you can add my character in game, I will help you. My IGN is: Zarry\n\nSo yeah, that is it for my long review and although my time on this game is coming to an end, I am happy it is finally getting the exposure it deserves because I know theres a kid out there right now maybe even reading this whos 12 or 13 years old that will fall in love with this game and aspire to be the very best player just like I did.\n\nGood look in the pros, newbs.","April 1, 2015","true","84.5"," 139 of 213 people (65%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","65","139","213","23","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yurop64/recommended/339610/","Yurop64","The Donald","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yurop64/","48 products in account","Bear in mind that this review comes from a person who used to play Freestyle 1 a lot of years ago. I've played in Thailand servers, in Gamekiss (NA) servers, in 4Game (Russian) servers and my country always had a big community in this game because we are big on basketball. There will be a lot of comparing\n\nBefore my rant, remember: I HATE BASKETBALL.\nYes, I hate basketball. I've played this game for so long (the Freestyle 1 version) even though I hate basketball. You know why? Because this game is super fun even if you don't know anything about basketball. There is constant action, it's super rewarding to block, rebound and when you hit a 3-pointer, it's the best feeling ever.\n\nFreestyle 1 was actually rather bad.\nIt was full P2W, clothes that give attributes were all costing money, the OP moves that were difficult to block were all expensive and you HAD to buy them with real life money. There were serveral exploits like when you receive a pass, you get a speedboost. Exploiting that, you could always step back faster than your opponent and make yourself unblockable. Level system was awful, you only got your real position at level 15 and the grind to 45 (max level) was like the whole game. High level people could do anything and everything so you had to block them every time because they would hit every shot. You know why that was awful? That's right, the speed boost exploit.\n\nFreestyle 2 possibly improves every mechanic that existsted in FSSB1.\nSkills costs like 3k at the start, meanwhile you get like 50k points at the start by registering, eliminating the grinding element of the game.\nFreestyles (Skills that only makes your shot/dunk different, making it harder to be blocked) can now be used only once or twice per game because you have to meet the requirements to do them. However, once you do them, it's garanteed points, so I think that's a nice touch.\nYou choose freestyles on your own, instead of them spinning in the exact same order for the whole game.\nMusic is constantly playing in game, making you feel in action. Also, the soundtrack makes you super pumped, while you can also configure it\nFSSB1 Games were all the same: PFs/Cs rebound, pass it to SGs and they shoot 3points OR PFs just dunking and you can't block them because they have paid for the awesome almost unblockable dunks. In FSSB2, or at least in early stages of FSSB2, it won't be like this. SGs can be blocked easily, there are way more rebound patterns for rebounders to learn, etc.\nBigger skill variety\nCan be played with a controller. I haven't tried it yet, but I think it might be really fun\nAwesome rewarding system, making you feel progressing, most daily quests  aren't considered grinding and there are constant events. You also constantly get items and a lot of points, also making the game not P2W\nEVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE BASKETBALL, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS GAME\n\nIt's super rewarding. I watched a streamer play it with friends in front of 13k thousand viewers yesterday and he had a blast, meanwhile not even knowing that you can't shoot while you are getting defended by someone. He still had fun, I saw the excitement in his eyes meanwhile he was watching whether  the ball will go into the basket or not.  ALSO, IT'S SUPER FUN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS\n\nEven if you dislike basketball, dislike sports games like I do, you might still have a blast. It might still be super fun for you, or at least fun for 3-10 hours. You have nothing to lose, it's  free to play. Grab some friends, put your game pants and gunnars and go play it! This game is awesome and the devs definitely stepped up their game, adding new elements and improving  the old ones.\n\n\n\n\n","April 12, 2015","true","6.8"," 44 of 57 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","44","57","6","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joeyabuki4/recommended/339610/","joeyabuki4","Good Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joeyabuki4/","109 products in account","Having played this game for quite some time this is how I feel about it:\n\nPositive:\n+ It's fun: Seriously, the game is really fun.\n+ Has a nice mixture of simplicity and complexity: The game is easy to get into, the controllers are kind of basic but it has a high skill cap, it's hard to master them.\n+ Character Costumization: It's really nice.\n+ The game has tons of features to keep you entertained: Bingo, My Ball, Freestyles, Challenges, etc.\n+ It's rewarding to play: The achievement system combined with Bingo, My Ball, Freestyles, etc. makes you feel like a winner even when you're losing, so there's some reward in actually playing the game, even if you're not that good at it and just like playing it for the sake of having fun.\n+ MVP: MVP rewards the player that contributes more for the team instead of the one that just scores all the time. Maybe it could be a bit more balanced, but it's nice to see the game reward team play.\n\nOfcourse there are negative points too.\n\nNegative:\n- Paying actually makes you better: Or atleast makes you seem like you are. Paid characters, like Ginger, for example, WILL punish you if you make a mistake, they are deadly because of the bonus they are given. Maybe in higher levels of gameplay that becomes less noticeable, but in lower levels it's really noticeable, they barely miss. And also there are skill slots unlockable by paying, and that gives more options to people that pay to unlock them, giving them an advantage over free plays. I'll put this on capslock: THE GAME IS NOT FULLY PAY TO WIN. That's not what I'm saying here! What I'm saying is the feeling that I got, that if you're a free player and paying against a paid character in a similar player skill level it's more likeable that he will easily punish your mistakes thanks to the character he has than you are likely to punish is, since you don't have as much stats and special bonus as he has.\n- Matchmaking is... weird: I dont know how matchmaking works on this game, but more than a few times I got to play against players that you could see by the skills they were using that they were atleast 10 levels above the players on my team. And I also felt the reverse on some games, that I was being matched with people levels below. Most of the time it felt fine, but I think it was like 80/20, so I thought it would be worth to mention.\n- Menus: Menus can be a bit confusing for newer players, since they are presented with a huge BOOM of stuff.\n- Clarity: The game isn't very clear on some stuff. For example, I had to go google for quite a bit of time why I couldn't level any stat after putting 5 points into it and the game doesn't tell you what keys to use on your controller, so even if it supports it, it's kind of better to play on the keyboard. That kind of stuff.\n\nOverall it's a good and fun game. I recommend it, even if you don't like basketball that much, give it a shot and try to bring your friends to play it with you, only makes it more fun. I'm curious to see the game evolve, since It's kind of new, from what I've read.","May 12, 2015","true","94.5"," 41 of 52 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","41","52","2","3"

When it comes to BallingIsLife™ this game still deserves the award of being fun and even if you don't like sport games, this is still an enjoyable game due to the mechanics of it and animation which I find humorous. Game was my childhood and I'm still playing it.\n\nPros:\nEasy to learn\nFun to play\nLots of clothes and customizations\nLots of skills\nToy system is interesting to play around for stats\nStill feels like the old free style games\nDunking on people feels amazing!\nTournaments\nGrowing community\n\nCons:\nPay to win *Debatable*\nLots of foreign people play so teamwork is hard to communicate\nServers are a little unbalance from level caps\nLots of people sliding due to the lag of the server\n\nReasons why I say pay to win is debatable is because I have accounts that have never touched a single cent from my wallet, and overall I am still able to win games, on my main accounts I have 85% win rates on them and played over thousands of games with them, My personal opinion it really depends on your skill level and how you play the game, because when you're playing the game, you'll see that anyone can shoot and make baskets, or defend and block shots, its really how well you play with your team and how good your offense and defense is. Overall good game, I enjoy it and Its free, so play the game.","April 2, 2015","true","86.6"," 46 of 68 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","46","68","7","0"

Post game rewards and leveling up keeps you playing and grinding through the game. Just remember that if you want the best experience , team up with 2 of your buddies and it will be a lot more fun and enjoyable to play :)\n\nOverall: If your looking for a realistic basketball simulation - don't bother, It's not NBA 2K, but if your looking for a fun, grindy,arcady team game - try it out.","April 29, 2015","true","10.3"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","30","40","2","0"

If you enjoy the game, I recommend learning the basics of team-play if you want to advance any further: passing, rotating, defense, etc... like i said, it's not all just shoot shoot shoot steal steal steal...\n\nAbout the community... this game is sadly filled with a lot of kids who talks a lot of trash and have big egos... It's like high school all over again... everyone has their own "cliques" that they play with and will kick anyone else out (sadly, sometimes I don't blame this type of behavior because a lot of players don't bother to learn the game correctly so they become a liability to the team, therefore leading to no one wanting to play with them). I don't suggest you visit the forums of this game, especially on the gamekiss website, it's so toxic...\n\nOverall, I like the FSB series... but the horrible community and lack of competent players/teammates can make it frustrating for newcomers... If you have friends who are willing to go through the ups/downs of the game with you, I think FSB can be very enjoyable experience...","April 5, 2015","true","219.0"," 48 of 73 people (66%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","66","48","73","9","0"

I only experience small amounts of latency issues that really changed the tide of the match but it was rare.\n\nMy true gripe with the game is the balancing as you level up, not so much the balance once you're at the top of level and have unlocked all the skills and attributes. During the first few levels on the beginner server, the game is fun but it's ruined by ball hogs and people who don't understand the sport or the game at all. I think out of 50+ Matches I had in the beginner server, very very few of the matches were competitive. Either your team stomped the other team or your team got stomped because you were paired up with people who didnt understand the fundamentals to the game (would try to do half court shots with a C, SG's would just stay under the rim for a rebound) But the games that were closer in score were actually really fun. Once you're fresh out of the beginner server, thats when the game gets even worse, you still have people who don't understand the game at all but not only that, you are matched up against people who have unlocked very strong skills that you don't have access to until you grind out several dozen matches. These skills literally make the player exponentionally overpowered compared to the skills you have when you are a fresh level 12 (Alley-Oop spam, Back Step dribble, etc.) So you have to endure through these matches because more often then not, you will be paired up with people still learning the game and have no idea how to play against teams that are already overpowered so they resort to afk exp farming. That alone is abused like heck, people just matches just to afk and get the match experience because they know they will most likely lose to higher level players.\n\nI'd love to recommend the game because it can be really fun, but it just gets worse until you get to much higher level and everyone balances out and the game becomes more skill based. But enduring the grind of the early levels coupled with players that don't understand the game and the afk farm, just ruins it all for me.","April 13, 2015","false","27.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Gamers who have experience in NBA 2K series would find this extremely easy to play.\nAs for the characters, they are very cute and fierce. (I like Grace of Noble lol)\n\nThe downside is, it is very slow to load at the start of the game and at the start and end of every game. It lags occasionally.\nAnother downside is not everybody is speaking English, people usually prefer speaking their own language but I don't think that there's a language barrier, though. They prefer Filipino, Thai, Indonesian language and etc. (I am talking about the Asian server here) Sometimes it is an issue for them if you are from different country and their own native bad words are all around the shout-out area. Not a big deal, though, because the community is somewhat friendly too.\nAs for customization, there are a vast number of equipments that you can use but you cannot remove the default equipment of your character for some reason. like for instance, the armband defaults.\nAnother thing I don't like is the special characters are so expensive but I think it's okay because they are called special for a reason.\n\nI want Girls Generation (SNSD) characters to be released in the Steam version of the game too.","April 12, 2015","true","56.4"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","14","20","4","0"

Basically theres 3 "tiers" "leagues" for competive mode, which is the main event of this game, allthough you can play with and vs AI. I recommend AI-Game-Mode but the competive mode, the main dish so to say, sucks. I will explain. 1. This game is PAY 2 WIN, At first you might not see it directly but in later game you notice it is. The 3 Tiers are Rookie, Major and Pro. Rookie League: Either real noobs like you and me, with different outcome and so on. +Pro's with their new characters. In Rookie League some of them say stuff like "OMG OMG WORST SF EVER" "LEARN TO PLAY!" and many many harsh things. They dont bother to explain what exactly you did wrong and so on.  Even if you are C and they are SG and you dont manage to rebound EVERY ball, just maybe 50-60% it can happen easily that they start to flame. In Rookie League. Without asking your level or experience. Without explaining, without giving help.  If you manage to hit lvl 12 quick, which is easy done, the heat is on. Major League. If you mess up here, be prepared to see many censored lines^^\n\nNext thing: Even on EU Server, you see many many Russians. And they as unfriendly as a drunk russian could be.\n\nIf you dont want to sink lots of cash into the game, dont have many friends you can form a crew with and learn together with and as good as allways play together or have a thick fur or dont plan to play further than Rookie or Major League, stay away from this game. Call a friend. Play ball in RL. You might not dunk, but you might be able to end the next guy who flames you without reason or explanation.

But not when you created a new level 1 character and being called noob. Nevertheless, you'll level up eventually, so it's not really a problem to me. For the gameplay, it's smooth and good-looking. The graphic is weird but it does give you a fresh feeling, like, you know, first time playing a game that is made in Korea. Despite the community is a little bit bad, but, just stay strong and ignore them, like you're deaf or something. It's not a big deal, but the big deal is dealing with yourself. It's F**KING HARD to ignore them, and I've played this game for 700+ hours, you know how much pain I've gone through. But it's really fun, trust me. If you're a fan of basketball, or you love to play basketball but never had the chance to play it, it's a good game. And it becomes addictive when you play it for a several hours. So, for those who want to play it(after reading my review), please do play it with your friends, because everyone there is your rival. Only some of them are friendly(just like me), so I'll see you on the court. My name is qpJackqp in-game. Now here is the rating:\nAudio:7/10\nGraphic:7/10\nGameplay:9/10(because some player afk)*I assume you guys know what is "afk"\nCommunity:6/10\nOverall:8/10\n*Also, I spent RM120 on this game, LOL","April 20","true","941.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Absolutely NOT !!\n\nIt is simply a PAY-To-WIN  game. Let me elaborate rather briefly.\n\n1) You can purchase skill slots to constantly have an upper hand, therefore no matter how uber l33t your opponents are, you have more options.\n\n2) You can purchase special game characters that have higher stats by default, so a special PF will always beat common Center under the rim. You will cap your rebound, they will still out-jump you etc.\n\n3) You can purchase cards that will make your character un-blockable.\n\nBONUS: The majority of players are from Turkey / Russia, two countries located mainly Asia whose players absolutely love playing in the EU server, despite there are 2 asian servers. This means ridiculous lag to players based in the EU.\n\nYou will happily play the game at first and in the first 20-30 levels you will just give this the benefit of the doubt; then by the time you have learned the game you realise it's futile.\n\nDO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME !!","August 1, 2015","false","200.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","2"

It always has been ever since it was created with Sierra, I been playing FS for a very long time. However, I will not be putting this as a negative review since I still play this game and will always play it. I just love FS. Don't my cons scare you, however take it in consideration since it's true. If you don't believe me play FS 2 for about 25 hours and then tell me what you see.\n\nNow here is the pro and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Fun game when you have respectful players\n\nCons:\n- P2W: Pay to Win, which is very true. For example: When you buy a special character, you get a bonus stats when you create them. So if you were a PF, you would get a bonus like 5+ or something like that.\n- LAGGY, most of the players are from other countries playing on the US server. When you ask them why they don't play on theirs, they say something like "Nobody is on the server, blah blah"\n- There are some good clothes in the game, however if you want to add attributes to them you can but they only last like 30 days or so. It wasn't like in FS, where some clothes you could pay to add attributs and it stays with you forever.\n- The freestyles are random and you never get to choose which ones you want like in FS. For example, if I wanted miller time for my SG, I would have to get Freestlye tickets and play the random sh*t hoping I could get it.\n- Most people don't know how to play at all, and also there is a lot of holders when it's the last 20 seconds.\n- The last thing, its a god damn PAY TO WIN.\n\nSo, if you want to win a lot, you either do two things: First, pay money to get special characters, etc. Blah blah. Two: practice a lot and learn to PASS the ball, and use teamwork. I prefer the second option since in this game, it is easy to beat the special characters. And it's called TEAMWORK!!!","November 18, 2015","true","271.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","1"

Make the game more realistic and add some more physics and allow me to be able to block a dunk. There is also way too much to the game yet way too little, and what I mean by that, is there are stat cards and free styles and "magic" clothes that would give you the edge in a match. Just have normal basketball, that's all you need. Too little, basically what I said before, to where there aren't any game modes, and just there isn't much customization either, unless you wanna be a dragon helmeted nba player or a humongous black Jonas Brother.

It's not like I hate it, nor did I have a terrible experience playing it. Sadly it just doesn't really add up to an enjoyable game.\n\nLet's break this down quickly:\n\nPROS-\n\n- Cool Idea.  3v3 Online Basketball? Check.\n- Graphics are decent (Aside from horribly clunky animation)\n\nCONS-\n\n- No controller support.... in a sports game? In 2015?\n- No way of remapping keys. (Hope you like arrow key movement.)\n- OMG the music gets repetitive, and it never.stops.playing.\n- Doesn't feel like a basketball game, just a twitchy "be in the right place and press the right button at the right time" sim.\n- Pay to Win\n- No full court options.\n- Twichy Clitchy Clunky Character animations when playing. (Just look at the gameplay videos)\n- User Interface is confusing at best\n- No character creation, just customizing existing characters.\n\n\nI wanted to like this game, I really did. I love basketball, and the thought of a F2P online basketball MMO where you play as a single player sounded awesome.\nSadly after playing the game for about an hour and just closed it and uninstalled. This is NOT the game for you if you have a sports game itch wanting to be scratched. The gameplay basically consists of keeping your character as close the the opponents as possible and then pressing the appropriate button of steal or block at the right time. That's defense. Offense is basically just the opposite, but your steal and block buttons change to pass and shoot. Simple enough, the controls seem streamlined, although awkward. Only one problem... you can't change them. At all. No remapping, no controller support... wtf.\nIn game your character feels very sluggish when moving... even when you hit your dash key he moves forward about a head's width. Really. The half court isn't bad, but I'd love to see at least an OPTION for full court play. (though with the slow, clunky characters it'd take forever to traverse.) After playing 2 games I wanted to punch the person who made the music. It becomes obnoxious very quickly. There's about 3 songs, that just loop...\n\nAll in all I can't say I enjoyed playing this. It doesn't feel like a basketball game, and it's shortcomings, especially the controls, really kill it. (Some people may argue you can use third party programs to make a controller work with the game, but that does NOT excuse the game for not having any controller or remapping capability itself.)\n\nTLDR:\n\nIf you want to play a fun basketball game, go play something else.\n","April 2, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You open a room and stay with it open forever without starting any game).\n- No "click a button" Auto-Matchmaking to avoid room problems.\n- It seems like there's low playerbase some times.\n- A bunch of P2W stuff that you need to get better.\n- Menus are a little confusing for new players but you'll get used to it.\n- Should have a better introduction.\n- Servers have problems, be sure you play on your closest region or you'll find yourself DCing or having lag problems.\n\n*Overall it's really fun but difficult to get good at and understand how the game and systems work, give it a try!","August 31, 2015","true","11.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

OBT Player.\n\nThis game just went open beta when i went to search for FS1. So i decided to play the new FS2 instead. The mechanics is way different & more fluent/realistic.\n\nI didn't start alone though. I called a few friends to come & play with me, next thing you know, we enjoyed the game so much, we made our first max level. So after hitting max level, i made a new position & repeated that process til i made every position to 50. Besides the server/ping issue going around, the community was somewhat easy to connect with.\n\nI'll recommend this for anyone whose into sport game & connecting with people.\n\n","April 2, 2015","true","3.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

I had a splendid time playing this game with my friends the other day until... the 8th of April, 2015, 3:30 P.M. PST. Once I logged in to play this wonderful game, I retrieved my gifts and coupons. Afterwards, I went to buy some clothing to look swagggy. To test the clothing in-game, I went into a Co-op room. From there, I moved around and TRIED to shoot. From out of nowhere, I could not shoot. I kept pressing AND holding D, but all my character did were pump fakes (was playing as Shooting Guard). I was greatly upset. As an attempt to fix this problem, I played as another character. Unfortunately, I still couldn't shoot. My final attempt of fixing the problem was to reinstall the game. Once finished, I logged in and tried again. I had my hopes up, but Freestyle 2: Street Basketball disappointed me. I still could not shoot. Please, developers of this game, fix my problem and reignite my dreams. Thank you.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.","April 14, 2015","true","467.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had a splendid time playing this game with my friends the other day until... the 8th of April, 2015, 3:30 P.M. PST. Once I logged in to play this wonderful game, I retrieved my gifts and coupons. Afterwards, I went to buy some clothing to look swagggy. To test the clothing in-game, I went into a Co-op room. From there, I moved around and TRIED to shoot. From out of nowhere, I could not shoot. I kept pressing AND holding D, but all my character did were pump fakes (was playing as Shooting Guard). I was greatly upset. As an attempt to fix this problem, I played as another character. Unfortunately, I still couldn't shoot. My final attempt of fixing the problem was to reinstall the game. Once finished, I logged in and tried again. I had my hopes up, but Freestyle 2: Street Basketball disappointed me. I still could not shoot. Please, developers of this game, fix my problem and reignite my dreams. Thank you.

No one should ever talk ♥♥♥♥ about this glorious, godly game. This game deserves a 10/10 especially in the support, options, and spelling department(do they have a spelling department?). Please, rate 11/10 and play game all day everyday. Definitely no BS and no fail mechanics like good-ping-to-rebound, late blocking, bs blocks, or bs shots. NONE OF THIS IS IN THE GAME. DEFINITELY ALL BASKETBALL MECHANICS ARE LEGIT. THERE ARE DEFINITELY NO HACKERS IN THIS GAME...\n\nLegit Review(02/03/16):\nAfter playing this game for 10 months, it is safe to say that the company who runs this game is complete garbage. They do not care about the community at all, and would rather look for the game to turn into a gambling simulator than a fun basketball game. They do not care about hackers, and let them roam free. I would definitely be hesitant about picking this game up, but I will still recommend it because I still enjoy it very much. For other folks who are starting out... meh.\n\nTl;dr:\nGame is an arcadey-basketball game. A gambler's P2W game...","April 1, 2015","false","476.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

("10"? years) later [Maybe]\ni as a steam user check frequently on Free2Play Games and stumbled upon this game once more and decided to give it a try, i then told my friends about this gem of a game and sooner than we expected we were hooked to this game.\n\nif it werent for the competitiveness (and maybe) because i have fun with my friends i would personally set this game aside.\n\nand so 45Hours into the game i decided to make a review about this game, here are my Pros and Cons\n\n[PROS]\n\n<Competition>\n:: this game offers more than what you would expect and since it is a street basketball game each match will keep you sweating and shouting for better plays\n\n<Basketball>\n:: who doesnt love a good ol'Basketball game\n\n<Style>\n:: ability to choose what you look before going into a match to distinguish your character makes you feel great and awesome, who wouldnt want to go in looking fabulous?\n\n\n<Suspense>\n:: anything can happen within the match, i have encountered many times a great comeback\n\n<Reminiscence>\n:: remembering freestyle 1 and how far its gone is a great achievement for this game as i have never expected nor did it cross my mind to come back after all these years\n\n<Teamwork>\n:: you need 100% teamwork, so what if you keep getting those 3pts, hogging the ball will get you no where.\ni personally always play with my friends as we are always on skype to get better communication and coordination but playing with people you know you wouldnt need to say anything because they know how you play so all you need to do is give a signal and do the play\n\n<Something New>\n:: Mobas here and there, isnt it getting boring? FreeStyle 2 did the right choice to go on steam\n\n\n{CONS}\n\n>LAG<\n:: Yes, i am from the asian side of the world so most asians will understand my pain that we are having a hard time playing this game due to connection problems and sudden delays.\n\n>Elitists<\n:: you wont have fun as an SG i guarantee you that. you will be criticized\n\n>Unorganized Menus<\n:: its easy to understand and navigate BUT too messy in my opinion\n\n>Control Change<\n:: give us freedom to change these CONTROLS\n" http://steamcommunity.com/app/339610/discussions/0/618458030676990749/ " those of you who would like to support the Controls please bump this.\n\n\n[Other Concerns]\n-other than that i have no problem with the game.\nfix the asian servers asap.-\n\n\nThis is my Review as of now. this may change or vary depending on how the game will turn out in the future\n4/12/2015","April 11, 2015","true","268.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The game is also horribly laggy.\n\nEvery screen packs in as many 'look! buy this shiny crap!' buttons as possible.\n\nAll that being said, I think you should still at least give it a shot, since it's free and can provide a little bit of 3-on-3 fun.

Once you actually start the game you have absolutly no idea what you have to do, or whatever you actually can do. You just see lots and lots of buttons on your screen and noone is going to explain you what to do. Sure, the Tutorial teaches you the basics of the actual gameplay, but thats it.\n\n2. After some try outs you finaly found out how to start Matches with other Players...but oh wait...noone is gonna play with you, because youre a noob....and yes you are on the beginner server, but noone really cares, they just kick you out....constantly.\n\n3. If you somehow manage to get in a game, and you are really about to play....forget everything you know about Basketball buddy...teamplay ? pff this is the internet !!! If you dont have the Ball right off the start, ull never gonna get it again...at least not from your teammates that is. Your only chance to get the Ball is to make some lucky Rebounds or Steals, but passing the Ball seems to be somewhat prohibited in this game.\n\nso yes, after a little more of an hour i managed to join 15 Rooms, got kicked out of 14 instantly, had 1 match with other People and never got a pass.

I am known as Sinth, Cyntherea, BuckTucker and Persephone/♥♥♥♥♥ in this community. I have played the FSSB Series since its inception in North America.  History of Freestyle. [ http]\n\nIn late 2006 I started playing the Sierra Online Alpha version when it hit North America. I was instantly hooked. The pace of this game and the intricicies involved in "Pro" play are what keeps me engaged.\n\nWe cannot compare this version of Freestyle with the versions that came before it so I will review FSSB2 on it's own merits.\n\nReview:\nThis is a F2P game. You don't have to pay anything to get started and you don't have to pay anything to be "pro".\n\nCreate your character: Power Forward, Center, Small Forward, Shooting Guard, Point Guard.  It helps to have a basic understanding of Basketball to understand what these positions mean. You get a few default characters, with different stats based on position. Their are "Special Characters" or SPC's that you can buy with real money that have enhanced stats. What some people fail to realize is that if you are a "Free Player", that means NOT SPENDING $$$, you get a FREE SPC at level 50. So, no. you don't have to pay to get a Special Character.\n\nPeople that play this game are gonna say, "♥♥♥♥♥/Sinth/Buck what about having to pay for extra skill slots?" Yes, extra skill slots cost $$$. My answer is, that if you want/NEED those then you are already high enough level or dedicated enough to "need" them. You can absolutely play without spending money. I have several alts that don't spend a dime and do just fine.\n\nNow the the F2P/P2P thing is out of the way, onto the game.\n\nThis is an arcadey Street Basketball game with cartoony graphics and has an urban flavor.  If you like fast paced sports action and have a need for twitch reflexology, then I can't recommend this game enough. If you hate childish, racist, ageist (I'm 40 years old) smacktalk... Uh... Look elsewhere. The community is harsh. Most of the community is 20ish... some older, most younger, and most very immature. Please don't let them get to you. Apparantly, IRL people talk trash on the court. I don't get it because I don't hoop IRL and haven't since the early 1990's...anyway...\n\nGraphics: 6/10\n-Cartoony characters, weird looking pets (pets give you + to attributes), odd outfits\n\nSound: 6/10\n- I turn off in game music and run Pandora in the background. People like to spam their emotes... BTW guys... super annoying.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\n- This game is all about timing, coordination and using skills wisely. It gets it right (PF's are OP but meh, I main PF), the classes are fun and true to their real life counterparts.\n\nFun Factor: 1-10\n- It's not a lot of fun to play with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's fun to play with people that at least try. Don't be an elitist and you will have more fun.\n\nI currently have 3 level 50's, 3 more toons in pro around level 40 and several other stragglers. Hit me up in-game and seek out Team Bruh if you are looking for a Crew (Club/Clan). I will be in rookie on a C, I look forward to seing you all and have FUN!\n\nAlso: I have always played with a controller. I do not play with a keyboard, if you can... I am amazed.\n\nSigned,\n\nBuckTucker - TeamBruh\n","April 1, 2015","true","0.4"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","51","20","39","7","0"

You will be shocked after playing against these guys, you will think they are cheating, you will be frustrated, may be you will quit playing the game. Now you are the ultimate rookie by getting to this point.\n\n*  before level 40 this game may seem easy, but it is not. So after becoming level 40 and even being  a level 50, with good piece of equipment, you are so weak. (Put aside the P2W equipment, cards which some of the cards you can aquire with in game currency and events, but the best clothes are time limited, so you need to pay real cash to make them permanent.) The real problem YOU STILL HAVE NO IDEA about this game. Passing at the right time, finding the free teammate, when to fake, when to drive, when to shoot, All of them requires deep knowledge about the game play and big experience. Average player needs thousands of games to be a competetive "level 50", and for each different position you still need additional experience.\n\n* You need a good team, or a good crew. And the friendship mechanics, crew mechanics are awful in this game. So basic like designed for handheld basic nintendo.\n\n* You find a good guy, he knows about this game, so you be friends. But only with that position, you have no idea about his other chars. At some point you have 5 chars and you time to time play with each other like all the other guys who are into the game. So there SHOULD be a main CHAR NAME, so by only interaction with that char will be enough to communicate with players all other chars.\n\n* The Crew Function ( Basicly your TEAM, CLAN,...) , totally awful, as a crew master, you have so limited options. You can not classify, sort, you can do nothing usefull. You can only delegate managers, accept players, or kick players out of crew. You have to spend enormous time to have a good crew, you have to know each player well, that is not practicable. YOU MUST HAVE (as a crew master) ability to see player stats, I dont mean attribs, but total stats or monthly stats, as you can see yours. I think you can not even see the level of your crew members (LOL), you can see this during their application only. You can not see inactive players, as you can not sort anything. YOU CAN NOT assaign them titles like, ROOKIE, VETERAN, PRO or whatsoever to classify them, which is a must in a serious clan, crew based mmo.\n\n* The games lottery system, prize system so rigged. Lots of times you will get very piece of junk items like 100 points or even blank. If the system briefly tell you there is high chance of getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items IT IS OKAY. But you see the WHEEL OF FORTUNE for example, there is lets say 24 pieces, 1 of them is 100 points (smallest prize), you turn it 10 times and 5 times you get 100 points, come on this is BS! than put more piece and increase number of 100 points. This is like  slot machines with cheating mechanisms, casino wins all the time :)\n\n* Information given by the game, about almost everthing is SO SMALL. Like 3 point attribute, 3 point success rate, which one is what ??? Which one includes what, which is better ? NO INFO !\nWhat about Tussle, who needs tussle , what is that, ??? So you will spend your valuable points on stats you will never need, because you have no idea.\n\n* There should be some graphical improvements like antialias may be?\n\n* There should be optimisation of network code. Still we have disconnects from match loading screens, match would not start for multiple tiries. Some lags which affects gameplay, a player 3 meters left of you can block you with the help of Mr.Spock with a teleportation.\n\nSo final state of the game :\n\nPros:\n\n+ Still Great gameplay\n+ Seems like devs are listening players after steam\n+ Some of the problems are sorted out after steam release\n+ Old the pros are valid from first review\n\nCons:\n\n- Still P2W.\n- Big gap after level 40 with high levels, gap with experienced or/and p2w players.\n- Awful friendship interface, lacking of an appointed main char for general relations and comms.\n- Awful Crew system.\n- Flawed lottery system.\n- Lack of information about the game (stats,...)\n- Need improved graphics.\n- Need better network code.\n\n\n\nOLD REVIEW:\n---------------------------------\n\nI have been playing this game during OBT. I have 1 level 50 SF, lvl 36 C, lvl 27 SG, lvl 5 PF. Also I had played FS1 long time ago. So do not mind the steam play time.\n\nFirst things first, this game is PAY TO WIN (P2W). With earned points you can purchase items, which will give you around +5 attrib, but if you purchase item with real money you can go up to +13 or even +18 (so this is the pay to win aspect of the game) (Also there is the toy thing which can be P2W)(you will encounter PG who can steal all your balls, really annoying, a balance issue much more than P2W although P2W makes them so strong at stealing)\n\nAside from this, I definitely recommend this game, because it is SO MUCH FUN. You can level up to level 50 (final), and build a good player, you can compete with others (wallet warriors). You can compete with others by Team PLAY and SKILL.\n\nSo if you have a good team, crew, friends. YES YOU WILL ENJOY THIS GAME.\n\nIF you like basketball, yes you will enjoy this game. BEWARE you can NOT be a jordan or kobe, trying so will gain you only FRUSTRATION. You need team play, if you are high level, with good items and skills, yes you can be KOBE :) , MJ not so sure :))\n\nPRO\n\n+ Nice graphics\n+ Basketball online at best\n+ 3 divisions according to your level, so you dont get smashed by high levels\n+ If you understand the game and be a team player, SUPER FUN\n\nCONS\n- P2W\n- Need somehow good ping\n- OBT players can be a bit unfriendly ( they do not have the patience for rookies, noobs)\n- Difficult to understand core game mechanics for a newbei (including cards, toys and GAMEPLAY)\n*- After steam release, game is experiencing lag which I have encountered 1 in a 50 games series during OBT. So this is an issue now.\n\n* A major con was the low player base, I hope it will change with steam, this game deserves it.\n\nOVERALL: 7.5/10  ( a great game, if it was not P2W, it would be a 9 )\n\nYES I DO RECOMMEND, no body is perfect :)\n\nBTW I see most of negative reviews is due to absence of SEA server ( so this guys want this game to fail, instead of earning money and starting a sea server)","April 1, 2015","true","0.7"," 21 of 41 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","21","41","4","1"

What I found instead was a poorly translated storefront with a terrible basketball game attached.\n\nBest I can tell, you are forced to control your character with the keyboard rather than a gamepad, which seems an odd choice for a basketball game. The rules of the game (both in terms of the rules in the rulebook and the way basketball works) are implemented very simplisticly. For example, if you want to block a shot, You'll need to be sure you're in front of the shooting player. It's literally impossible to block a short from the side or from behind.\n\nIt feels like a board game implementation of basketball, and, as much as I like board games, the beauty of video games is that the game can juggle as many rules and variables as you can throw at it. Board games have to be simplified because people have to manage all those rules themselves. For a game as dynamic as basketball, this implementation doesn't create a very satisfying experience.\n\nThe UI is ridiculous. Every screen has dozens of buttons labeled mostly with cryptic icons. As a new player, you'll be given several reward items after logging in, but you'll have no idea what they are or why you would want them. In this way, the game is extremely hostile to new players.\n\nIf there is any fun to be had in this game, it's well hidden behind a smokescreen of odd design decisions and mechanisms designed to get you to give them money.","April 3, 2015","false","0.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

I use it when I want some casual PVP.\n\n+ Game promotes teamplay. Pick'n'rolls, open threes, big guys spreading the floor, it's all there, and you actually get this nice feeling like in RL ball game when team play goes well.\n\n+ Nice position differences give you different angles of gameplay (don't play C or PF if your ping is high, you will suck at rebounding)\n\n+ Real money needed only if you really decided to go hardcore and need those extra skill slots.\n\nSo if you like basketball and you're okay with this comix graphic style you should give this game a try.\n","April 30, 2015","true","52.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Gameplay is good and fun, and even if you got 1 bad player on your team, no game is lost. Also the Presentation is cool and even playing Defence is rewarding.\nI was fed up with NBA2k15s streetball mode, because it was lagging so hard it was unplayable. This game felt very direct and no lags at all. That part was really well done.\n\nBut that said ... what ruins my experience after over 24h ingame is the Pay2Win which is absolutely over the top.\nIf you play with the normal characters vs. normal characters, it is all fun and fair. I also don't mind paying for faster leveling or extra gear, not even for some additional skillslots and other minor advantages.\n\nWhat absolutely kills the game are the special purchaseable characters. While there are some that only grant a minor advantage like a small stats boost in a certain stat, there are some that just can't be beaten with the free chars, unless the other player is a total noob.\n\nAs an example, playing as Center, it is impossible to get rebounds vs. some pay-centers, even with the perfect timing.  If you walk into them they just push you away automatically and you stumble backwards, for example. So no chance of even getting close to the hoop.\n\nAlso there are chars that grant you a +40 stats boost that you can assign as you wish. And that is A LOT!\nSo if you level up, you get +2 stats per level. so These speciial chars have a 20 level advantage over you statswise. This just can not be beaten. It is like playing a level 1 vs. level 20 char ... or 10 vs. 30 and so on.\nThis is just very very frustrating and unfair.\n\nI really like the game, but I do not see a point in spending 10 bucks on chars I don't want to play because the P2W system forces me to. And then ... I don't think it is entertaining pounding normal chars with my pay chars, because they have no chance. There is no challenge in that and it would be unrewarding and boring. At least for me.\n\nSo one good thing is, the game offers a newby channel. There is a normalchannel for levels 1-11 and a newby channel 1-11. You can only get into the newby channel if you did not level a char past level 11.\nWhile I was in there, it was the most fun and the best times. Why, because almost noone had those imba chars there.\n\nonce you move to the normal channel or past level 12 ... you encounter a pay char in what feels like 2/3 of the games. If you are "lucky" you get that guy/gal on your team ... easy mode. If you are even unluckyer, it is your direct opponent. If you quit the game, you do not get the rewards ... so you just get pounded for another 5 minutes. I always try to compete ... which in the end just makes it more frustrating. And now brings me to the point where I uninstall the game and move on.","May 1, 2015","false","80.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Almost no players, you either go up against someone completely trash or someone with no life and uses P2W features.\n\n2. SG and PF is broken, they're far too OP against the other positions, no reason to play PG, SF or C. (SG never misses 3pt and PF can rebound and dunk just as good as C also they're faster.\n\n3. I'm uninstalling this ♥♥♥♥ and going back to NBA2K.\n\n4. Feels I was scammed even if the game is free.\n\n5.

I use it when I want some casual PVP.\n\n+ Game promotes teamplay. Pick'n'rolls, open threes, big guys spreading the floor, it's all there, and you actually get this nice feeling like in RL ball game when team play goes well.\n\n+ Nice position differences give you different angles of gameplay (don't play C or PF if your ping is high, you will suck at rebounding)\n\n+ Real money needed only if you really decided to go hardcore and need those extra skill slots.\n\nSo if you like basketball and you're okay with this comix graphic style you should give this game a try.\n","April 30, 2015","true","52.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is not super realistic, but it has so many moves and ways to customize a player that you build from the ground up. Its an RPG at the same time as being a great sports game. You feel like it is you at a park playing when you control your character, just very fun, very well done. The old freestyle 1 was great and now I am enjoying this sequel.\n\n+ RPG style progression mixed with sports\n+ Lots of cool skills to learn as you lvl up & items to equip for originality\n+ Great competition online vs. others & team work game\n\n- Pay to Win as you can purchase items to boost stats and buy special characters with money too\n- Ping is very important so if you are on East coast you cant rebound/block guys with lower ping in the west very easily, they beat you to the jump.\n- The Devs don't care much about their playerbase. Windows 10 took 4 months to get patched in, the only game I had trouble with and they knew about it 4 months too. No compensation or even a sorry to us.\n\nIf they fixed ping and took away the P2W aspects it would be a perfect street ball game, how it is now, its a 6/10, but still recommend it to all bball fans.","June 4, 2015","true","644.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Every aspect of it screams perfection. When you first open up this beautiful masterpiece, you are immersed in the environment by means of its superlative soundtrack, it drowns out all other thought and just fuels the roaring fire that is the desire to play this game. When trying to navigate the menus, you are bombarded by its puzzle-like nature, making the time when you actually figure out what to do so magical. The character create screen prohibits the majority of names which allow one's creativity to shine, not only this, but the process itself is complex, no tips are given which proves it to be not for the faint of heart. The gameplay is unlike that of any other game I have experienced in my recently unfulfilled life, every aspect is flawless from the minimal controls to the minute amount of dialogue, which permits the focus on the important part; landing slamming dunks. Being immersed in a 200 ping world makes every move count which just adds to its brilliance.

Back in the 40s Mao Se Tung created this game to try to spread and infect the world with communism. He used the domino tactic and started the Vietnam war. China ended up suceeding in the spread to communism and even infected a U.S president John Franklin Kennedy. John Kennedy was a communism; who was implanted in the United States to transform the U.S into a communist state so we all had to give up our wages. Thank god for the hero LBJ who arranged his assassination and stopped him from destroying black supremacy, and the group called The Black Panthers. Most of the citizens dont know this story but here I am telling you. I used to work in the CIA and im retired now and I was involved with the Bay of the Pig Invasion. I was onto Kennedy from the start and knew everything he was doing like almost faking an attack of Cubans for reason to invade. People dont know this but Kennedy is an alien from Boötes I galaxy.

The problem is that everything is tight to the point of feeling stiff and the animations are clunky as all hell.\n\nNot to mention that dispite it being a PC game, it does not use the mouse and instead uses the arrow keys to move. THE ARROW KEYS. Whatever is included in the controls right now could have easilly been replaced with proper WASD and left/right click bindings. You might be able to rebind them, maybe, I didn't really care enough to notice.\n\nAnyway, animations; good lord they are terrible. You run like the floor is ice, kind of hovering in place even though you are clearly taking a step forward. Trying to steal is pretty much impossible. Even the AI which is better than the average player can't steal.\n\nAt least the game has some nice music and it looks okay. Though good luck seeing what character is on the screen.

I've put in about 30 or so hours into this game and I have enjoyed my time spent with it for the most part.\n\nFreestyle 2 is a basketball game that is published by Joycity and hosted by Gamekiss. The game is run on a free 2 play model and while that may raise red flags for some, I've found it to be very fun and fair. After logging in, you are able to pick from a couple of classes. Small Forward, Point Forward, Center, Shot Guard, etc. After choosing a class, you are shown a list of different characters, that are really just chosen based on your preferred look or style. The game doesn't really offer any body customization like skin color, hair, eyes. But you can purchase different clothes, wigs, etc in the game shop. (They actually have a decent selection for the ingame free points that can be earned through playing.)\n\n~Gameplay~\nI've found the mechanics of this game to be enjoyable, they all work how I'd expect. The controls definately took some getting used to. It's been a long time since I've used my keyboads directional keys.\n\nThe A button is to drive dribble, which consumes stamina and allows you to dash with the ball to pass your opponent.\n\nS is to pass or steal\n\nD is to shoot or block\n\nW is to guard or post up. (Moving towards the basket with ball in a slower and more defensive motion.\n\nI've found that it's a little bit harder to play defense than offense, but it all works well and feels really good when you dunk on an oppenent and he/she is slammed back down.\n\nYour character(s) also have stats and level up. Level 50 is the max and the progression can be a bit slow after level 30. You put points into various attributes like 3 pt, layup, middle shot, speed, stamina, etc. The stats feel somewhat minor and it take's a bit to really notice a big difference. You can also buy skills and this opens up the game to a lot more, making it faster and way more interesting. One of the skills I received allows me to drive dribble back and forth to really shake up my opponents.\n\nI find the gameplay extremely enjoyable and for that alone, I can reccommend this game to just about anyone especcially if you have friends, but we will get to that.\n\n~Graphics~\nThe game looks nice. It's a very simple cel shaded style and it runs pretty well on most low end computers that I've played on as well.  If you turn up the game to high/medium, you may notice the game having a blurry effect on the characters. I personally didn't like this effect and found the game to look better on low. You only have preset graphic selections of low, medium, and high, so I found no way to turn it off. Speaking of which, I should probably talk about the options menu a bit more.\n\nYou cannot rebind your keys for drive dribble, pass, shoot, steal, or your movement. I found that to be a bit silly in a pc only game. Also no controller support, but they offer a guide on the site's forums that is stickied and it explains how to use a controller. This is still not a good thing in my opinion and hopefully they will add more options in the future, but I don't see it happening.\n\n\n~Sound~\nThe music is different to say the least. It's like k pop mixed with rap. I personally liked it and at times found it hilarious, but after a while I got tired of hearing the same tracks over and over again and listened to some of my own music.\n\n\n~Community~\n\nDisclaimer: Another persons experience may differ from mine.\n\nSo the community is pretty small, but you should not have an issue finding any games. Though, I must reccommend playing with friends. Usually in a small community, you would expect players to be a bit more tight-knit, but that is far from the case. There are a lot of people that say the trash talking is just apart of the game. I can agree some what with that, but that isn't where my problem with the community really comes from.\n\nYou will experience more ♥♥♥♥ talking from fellow team mates. Players will berate you if you just get unlucky and miss a shot. You may see people go into all chat and call there own teammates noobs, because they are losing the game. (You lose nothing important by losing a game except your winrate and you still recieve the same exp and points for losing or winning.)\n\nEdit: I can understand someone not wanting to see their win ratio lowered. I've done quite a bit of competitive gaming and sometimes communities will judge based on your win ratio and not your actual skill. It's just the way of the world, unfortunately.\n\nI have to reccomend that you play this game with friends, because it is an extremely good time with people you know, win or lose.\n\n~Cash shop pay to win or not?~\nI've played up to level 50 so far and have not experienced any real need to pay. Though there are things to pay for if you want to min max. There are cards that can be found with either luck or in a gachapon that boost your stats by a couple of points and then can be upgraded further. Some may want to find the best versions of those cards that upgrade the stats they want. There are also some cash only cosmetics to purchase, but no outfits have an expiration date and as I've said earlier, I was able to find a decent selection for points and they didn't take very long to buy.\n\nYou can pay for extra skill slots and that seems to be the most pay 2 win aspect, but from what I've read, you can make a  good character without ever paying.\n\nThere are also exp boosts and such for conveniece and I've found the model to be fair and I don't think there is anything wrong with the system.\n\n~Conclusion~\n\nI can definitely reccommend this game to just about anyone, especially if you have friends to play with. You will have an easier time with the community if you solo que at a lower level, but once you get into the higher leveled games, you will see a lot of hostility from your own teammates. Other wise, this is probably one of the best basketball games I've ever played. It runs well and does everything I'd expect from it.","April 1, 2015","true","0.2"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","13","27","3","0"

This game is literally, NBA 2K games with a Play-Pay 2 Win concept.\n\nThe gameplay is God awful, has a lot of bugs which the devs will not even look into fixing; characters you pay to unlock have extra training points which gain you  an advantage over the other players who beat their asses to level up by playing with un-♥♥♥♥ing-beatable opponents, by the way they also implemented new positions so now you can play as multiple positions in one character! So there is no meaning of PGs or Cs anymore, SWs/CTs/DGs and other characters make up for ALL of the original positions.\n\nThe skill system is also really ♥♥♥♥♥♥, they make you pay tons of credits that range from 2000 to tens of thousands but you gain only 75-120 per match if you don't have VIP or the other boosters. Oh by the way, YOU CAN PAY ACTUAL MONEY TO UNLOCK SKILL SLOTS.\n\nAnother thing to point on, you can get special abilities added to your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ COSTUMES. These can be pass/steal/intercept etc. boosters and can also make you AVOID F*CKING SCREENS AND BLOCKS. "Oh, did you try to block that last minute shot? MAYBE I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO BLOCK THAT."\n\nThere is also a "card system", which you can put different cards that boost your abilities by a bit in 3 different slots; offense, defense and talent. If you try to upgrade a card, you need to have 2 or more spray depending on the level of the card. You rarely get spray from boxes and gifts, and there is no way to get more other than, you guessed it, putting more credits to buy more spray which is damn expensive.\n\nBy the way, I'm not somebody who played the game for a minute and left. I'm level 30, I played it enough to know what the minor and major issues this game has.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend it. If you want to pour cash into the game to wreck newbies, fine. Go with it. Just keep in mind that you won't be able to progress really quickly unless you spend money.","January 22","false","73.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","2"

Stop. Stop thinking that right now, if you honestly like this game and have played it before and can handle the terrible controls and stupid commentary and foolish music choice then CONGRATS! You are the spawn of Satan and everything un-holy. BUT if you are a first timer and have NEVER played this before thinking it looked fun. Well it's not, it's a big pile of steaming crap, sat on your doorstep ready for you to un-knowingly stand on it when you step outside your door.

Big black PF. His hitbox is GINORMOUS. As in, it's impossible to block his dunks. Like, literally impossible. It's an extremely ♥♥♥♥ing OP character. If you have one of these guys in your game, he's automatically going to win MVP of the game and you WILL lose if he's not on your team.\n\nThe PF position is way overpowered. Even aside from Big Joe. The PF position is stronger than every other position by a huge amount. They'll almost always dunk over a Center. This game assumes that every single PF in the entire ♥♥♥♥ing world is LeBron James, which just isn't the case.\n\nIf you're a C or a PF or a SF, you'll never hit 3s no matter how open you are. I understand that those position aren't usually used for 3s anyway, but you know how to make it so it's actually fair? When you shoot, there's an accuracy bar as in every basketball game really. You have to get the slider into the green position to get a good shot. On these positions, there isn't a green section. Make there be a green section, but make as tiny as my ♥♥♥♥♥. There's no reason for the game to say, "Hey, you're not supposed to be taking those kinds of shots, so you're just gonna automatically miss it."\n\nWhen you get a "perfect shot" after hitting the green on the slider (hit the green, nobody guarding you, full shot quality), it'll almost certainly miss. Either take out the little "PERFECT SHOT!" graphic or actually make it hit.\n\nThe game has Pay2Win features. You CAN win without paying, but people who pay money for cards are just bound to have better stats.\n\nThere's a Skill called box out that can be placed on PF and C. If you don't know what boxing out is, it's basically guarding the basket to get a rebound. This skill needs a big tweek job in the game. If you even touch somebody while they're boxing out, your character will get stuck for like a second as they back up. It's enough to have the space to get a rebound against somebody, but making that person freeze for a second just for bumping into them is stupid as ♥♥♥♥. Anybody who has the box out skill is always going to get the rebound.\n\nThe swear filter in this game is the absolute WORST I've ever seen. It's bad enough that the developers think they're our parents by having us not swear, but to censor things like "pass, idk, etc." is stupid. Just get rid of the swear filter altogether or make is optional. It's not that ♥♥♥♥ing hard to do. The announcer in the game SAYS words that are filtered in chat. This is a team game. Maybe have the ability to use the mic or something. Communicating with the team is a horrible pain because of the swear filter.\n\nThe menu on the game is terrible too. You have to learn how to use it and where things are located by doing it. The game gives no explanation about cards, freestyles, skills, etc. When applying attributes to your character, the developers need to have it to where when scrolling over the name of the attribute, it gives an explanation about what that attribute actually does. You recommend that the PF puts there attribute points on "Tussle?" What the ♥♥♥♥ is "tussle?" Why should I put my points on it? What's it do?\n\nMost of the time, pressing ready with your team and going to the matchup screen will work. I'd say like 60% of the time it'll work. The other 40% of the time, you're gonna get stuck at 30%, which will take you back to the practice room with your team. That's a problem. If this happens to you, you won't be able to start a match again until the readied players unready and ready back up.\n\nSome problems with the community: Why the ♥♥♥♥ even press the "ready" button if you're just gonna go AFK as soon as the ♥♥♥♥ing game starts? You serious? Way too many people do this. If you're not ready, don't press the "ready" button. It's not hard.\n\nSome people lag badly when they have the ball. I'm pretty sure this is intentional. You'll be defending someone and it'll look like they're running to the sidelines, but when they catch up, they're on the other side of the court behind the 3 line with nobody on them. Easy 3... unless you're a C, PF, or SF, but I won't rant about that again.\n\nYou'll get into games with people who will shoot the ball no matter what. They never look for the open man. They'd rather get blocked or miss it by 289371 feet if it meant making 1 out of 10 shots they put up.\n\nThe problems that made me uninstall the game were the Big Joe character and the broken box out skill.\n\nI don't recommend anyone play the game until they fix a lot and get rid of the swear filter. You know, so you can actually talk to your teammates in a team game.\n","May 8, 2015","false","87.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.","April 13, 2015","true","56.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While the technical issues, such as the slowdown and the legacy problems with the AI and shooting are dismaying, they don't completely destroy the on-court experience, which is still strong enough to allow FreeStyle to hold the basketball crown for yet another year.","February 14","true","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While the technical issues, such as the slowdown and the legacy problems with the AI and shooting are dismaying, they don't completely destroy the on-court experience, which is still strong enough to allow FreeStyle to hold the basketball crown for yet another year.","February 14","true","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You need your time to master just 1 position, and a lot more if you plan to master all 5 positions.\nBig downside is game is full of "im-too-pro-to-play-with-you", new players are harassed, bullied, and insulted in 1/2 of the games (in the rookie channel), 9/10 in pro channel (that you will reach after just 1-2 weeks of play).\nYou may find this 1/1000 person that may help you and give hints about how to get better, but its a rare event (i have found like 2 people in 1 month).\n\nSo if you are a rager and don't mind at all the "standard internet game community" education level there's some fun here. If you have some minimal education or don't have the patience to deal with raging kids 24/7 you may aswell skip the trouble of playing.\n\nPlus the P2W side is strong. Don't expect to win any game against a team of full stuffed cash heavy players, unless you are one of them.","June 22, 2015","false","960.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It being focused on Team play mainly is pretty good but you know, you get those ball hogs that don't pass when you're open... facepalm. Anyway this game is good with 2 other friends, other than that there isn't more problems, its a great and fun game, pretty grind fested BUT though it might be grindy its still very enjoyable and not that boring. The only MASSIVE issue I have other than the team mates which isn't so bad is the lag. And its pretty dang big. I live in Australia so I have to play on the Asian servers since I get the best ping. I thought having 170 ping was good, nope. If you have over like 80 ping you can barely do good. Well I am not to sure about under 100 ping but over 100 its horrible. You get blocked on your shot all the time, even if you're open for a split second, INSTANT block EVEN THOUGH you shouldn't of been blocked. Same goes for rebounding, person has better ping they'll get it.\n\nSo in the end its a great game but the ping and teammates is the only horrible part.

This game isn't your average Basketball game *cough 2K13-15 cough*\n\nSo If you are not used to the way the controls are set up, It's a game where the mouse is not at all required during a match. It would be useful to use the scroll as a shoot/hold button. But this game does have VERY LITTLE flaws. One flaw is the servers when in a 3V3. And other is the way when ever someone drives and you just see this blur. Oh wait... it's call KISS MY FAST!

Here is a little message for the developers: if your player selects some game mode (for me it was: tutorial) and wishes to exit that game mode, you should let them do that.  Typically this occurs by pressing ESC key to get to a menu.  In freestyle basketball you will not receive this courtesy, if you decide you want out, you are going to have to complete that tutorial.\n\nI somehow knew it was going to happen, but this was by far the worst gaming experience I have had in years.  There are plenty of decent free-to-play games out there.  This is not one of them.","May 25, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The menus are so convoluted and it took way too long to figure out. On top of all that when we finally figured it out it simply would not let me join for unexplainable reasons. I suspect it's because my level isn't high enough but I don't see why that should stop me from trying to play a game with my friend against ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bots for christ's sake. Incredibly stupid rule that the game does not even put any effort to warn you about that wasted about an hour and a half of my time. The gameplay isn't even that amazing to warrant such messy menu navigating. Sure it's fun but very simple, it was something I planned to play for the afternoon and probably never pick up again and I couldn't even do that. When you have to look up how to do something as simple as joining an internet game with your friends, there is something wrong with your game.","March 14","false","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Here is a little message for the developers: if your player selects some game mode (for me it was: tutorial) and wishes to exit that game mode, you should let them do that.  Typically this occurs by pressing ESC key to get to a menu.  In freestyle basketball you will not receive this courtesy, if you decide you want out, you are going to have to complete that tutorial.\n\nI somehow knew it was going to happen, but this was by far the worst gaming experience I have had in years.

You unlock these as you level up your separate characters, skills do not transfer between characters so every time you make a new one it will be like starting over again. Something else that doesn't go between characters is your inventory (Unless it's a character coupon) so everything you get with a character can't be used with another, which is really good as you can't make a new character but give them clothes or cards that a level 50 (Max level) character would use.\n\nWhat does go between characters is points and money (Points being things you get after a game and money being what you buy with real money) so you may be able to buy a skill (which use regular points) as soon as you unlock it instead of having to wait for you to get more money. What also is between characters would be sponsors (Being exp, points and VIP) which gives you a boost in what you get after a match. You can get these by either buying them or getting them dropped through one of the many events that take place.\n\nThe main downside to this game is that I live in England but my friend who I play with lives in America, meaning that if we decide to play together, one of us will have to sacrifice some ping to go to the other server, luckily the account goes between severs so I can play in Europe server with my characters while not playing with my friend and level them up.\n\nAll in all, this game is really fun and I recommend it to anyone that wants a basketball game to play with friends but doesn’t have a lot of money, but you can always spend money if you want. You can always win if you are good enough, so just practice and have fun!\n","May 16","true","420.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Do not quit the game early because it will be a bit rough in the beginning as a rookie because you will be playing with other rookies who may or may not have experience with the game.\nYou can play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 in (Friendly Match Mode) but stats and records are only recorded on 3v3 (TeamMatches). To be successful in this game you have to find good teammates. One man armies are almost non-existent unless you are talking about me. :) Learn the basics of the game and try not to spam dribbles because that will just make you look like a fool when you end up on your back in the dirt.\n\nTips: Ping is a big factor in the game but it is still playable. Also use gkash on skill slots, don't buy a bunch of item balls because 90% of the time you will get a point coupon or something that expires after 7 days. Other than that real good game when you have solid teammates.\n\nGood Luck and Have Fun!","April 1, 2015","true","1.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

I will admit I dont think I am very good at it at this time, but I enjoy what I have played.    Now that by no means its good to go, I feel its got some big kinks that need banged out before it gets popular.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the gameplay, but A few things keep me from loving the game.\n\n- Ping, I had good ping most of the time, but if someone one your team is not running the game at 100 percent you are in for a bad time!\n\n- Cash shop I feel needs some work.  you should never get an actual gameplay advantage over other players from a cash shop purchase, that everyone else cant get with grind.\n\n- Bugs, I havent seen this mentioned by anyone else yet but I have encountered many.  the three best ones I have seen are the basketball hitting the ground so hard it shoots into the sky, after it was up there it got notmal physics again though so after like 10 bounces it started to get to a normal level again so someone could catch it.   Then there was the time one of the AI players got his legs stuck in the ground and could not move the rest of the match. or better yet the time the AI got the ball and ran into a corner and just started spazzing out, over and over again.  Fun times.\n\n- Menues can be hard to  maneuver some times, I dont know if its a bug or im just not getting it but I always end up on the wrong "page"\n\nThere are a good deal of positives though! These include,\n\n- There is adiquate character customization\n\n- The gameplay seems sound, I jsut wish there was controller support\n( I feel this game could use it)\n\n- overall art style is pretty neat, not your average anime-esque\n\n\nReally though I dont see anything that cant be fixed with a little time and patience.  there is a good base to work from and I like the art style a good deal, I just hope they make the changes the community want.  Another small note that doesn't fall in the plus or minus spectrum is that the community has a pretty good deal of all around A-holes.  The kind of player you usually only see in mobas! so be warned. Otherwise if it still sounds interesting after all that give it a try!","April 5, 2015","true","7.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
