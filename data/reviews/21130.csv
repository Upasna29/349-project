Every room has TONS of things to interact with.  The animations are done well for all the characters, or as the cool kids call them, minifigs.  Attention to the smallest details is seen right from starting the game, from differences in how Harry and Hermione Granger walk, to how Ron freaks out when using his wand.\n\nYou can play as everyone from the movies, from Malfoy, to Ginny, and even the professors.  All of Hogwarts is recreated from the big room they all sit in, to the dorms where they live.  Lots of fun abilities, like turning back time, make the same world seem new again.  There is ALOT of content in this Lego game, very impressive the level of detail.  Not being a Harry Potter fan I had a great time playing the game, and oddly like the game better than the movies.\n\nRating:  10/10  Value:  49.99","February 14, 2014","true","52.6"," 96 of 108 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","96","108","0","2"

The game has lots of places to visit and explore and even when you finish it, there's a lot of secrets to unlock. The gameplay is very easy, relaxing and addicting. The soundtrack is the same from the movies which makes the scenarios even more immersive because you instantly remember about the movie scenes when you listen to them.

OF ALL TIME. This sounds hipster, but I liked Harry Potter before it was very popular. I went to go see J.K. Rowling speak in a tiny middle school gym, and she was the funniest, friendliest woman. It takes a special kind of person to be nice to a hundred yelling children in wizard costumes. For that alone, I'm willing to pay her some royalties by buying this game.\n\nOutrageously cute & funny. I don't have kids and I'm glad, because I don't want to share this total guilty pleasure, and also because that sounds suspiciously like effort.\n\nPros:\n\n* Amazingly fun & absorbing. Moves quickly enough to keep interest high, but has enough replayability and hidden items that you'll want to explore the grounds for days.\n* Zero navigational difficulty. It's all very straightforward, and even when you're a little lost it works. They're new to the school, staircases change around, and Mrs. Norris is always there to\n* Changes as the years progress. The NPCs do different things, the classrooms change, and there are distinct feels to each year.\n* Child friendly. Fights are usually comical and there's zero gore. Cheats can be used from the get-go, which is nice for the younger audiences. Otherwise, you can earn dem cheats throughout the game as bonuses, which is also awesome.\n* So much fun. Just so much fun. An incredible interpretation of one of the best series ever written.\n\nCons:\n\n* No achievements, this may seem nitpicky but I worked hard for that 100% & I want to prove to every single person that I have invested no time in "life" or "meaningful relationships" or "personal hygiene".\n* Crashes. I have a custom built PC and a high-end gaming top and both systems would crash. NEVER ALT-TAB. Don't keep other programs running while you're playing. Also, there is no cloud, so if you start a game on one computer, be ready to finish it on the same one.\n* Your friends will see what you've been playing on Steam and mock you. Whatever. No names, but some of y'all bought CoD: Ghosts. Don't you be judgy.","February 2, 2015","true","68.9"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","93","41","44","19","0"

Harry Potter films are awesome!  So i had to purchase HP1-4.\n\nAfter playing a few hours I was hooked.  The single player campaign is great, story sticks to the films and there are a few comedy moments in the cut scenes.  The story takes a good 20 hours to do, but if you play “free play” you will get at least another 10hrs.   Free play gives you the opportunity to collect the secrets you couldn’t find first time round, plus great replay value.\n\nThe gameplay is brilliant and multiplayer is just excellent.  I had so much fun having my boy’s play as a secondary character helping me collect all the items I need to get the 100% completion.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linusolsson/recommended/21130/","linusolsson","Z0mBi3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linusolsson/","2548 products in account","Do you like lego? Do you like Harry Potter? As a fan of both, I gotta say this is a great game. Lego harry potter is a simple, but fun game for all ages. I would recommend a controller to play, but keyboard works well too. You can play local co-op with a friend through the story.\n\nYears 1-4 means the first 4 books of Harry Potter, which includes: sorcerer's stone, chamber of secrets, prisoner of azkaban and goblet of fire. If you are too lazy to read up on the books, you can watch the movies. I would recommend doing both.\n\nLego games are known to be very lighthearted and funny. Since I have watched the HP-movies hundreds of times and also read the books I see the change between them and this game. If you aren't familiar with HP, you'll probably miss out on some puns and references. They managed to make so many serious moments of the book into silly and crazy cutscenes.\n\nGraphics isn't great but the game is several years old. The lego "style" doesn't age as bad as some other types of games though, so it's acceptable and totally playable. Game runs great (unlike years 5-7) with everything cranked up to max at beyond 1000 frames per second on my gtx 980. No problems with that, however the game have some minor bugs.\n\nIt surprised me just how long this game is! They actually included a lot of scenes from every movie. It felt like every movie was a game on it's own, which is great of course. When you get close the end of the game you might get bored though, because the gameplay is repetitive. Attack everything in every room, collect money and secrets, build objects, interact with them, go to the next room, and...repeat.\n\nIf you like the lore of harry potter and you enjoy lego you will probably play this the entire way though. I enjoyed this game a great deal, and I like the less serious lego approach to the story. I think it shows that the developers are fans of the series themselves and really know how to retell the story.\n\nAccording to stats this game is about 13 hours long if you play main story, and 27 hours for full completition. I guess that makes me slow then, because it took me nearly 30 hours, and I missed a lot of collectables. I tried to search all rooms though, but I still missed things. Also, you can go back to levels with different characters to unlock certain things. Some characters have spells that are unique, which I thought was pretty cool.\n\nAll in all, I really like this game and I think it was a relaxing and fun game to play. It looks okay, runs great and the gameplay is repetitive, but kinda charming. Devs managed to include all key plot points from the books and also a lot of extra. Now I just wish someone could make a good non-lego Harry Potter game, since the old licensed games don't do the HP-franchise justice.","February 24","true","37.5"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","39","42","4","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/21130/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","When the LEGO series burst onto the scene with LEGO Star Wars in 2005, it was an instant hit. The game's simple controls, fun humor, and family-friendly gameplay made it a classic among players and assured it a spot in the upper echelon of licensed games. However, as the LEGO series started branching out and extending its trademark influence across other properties, it seemed as if some of the spark had faded. The LEGO Indiana Jones games in particular were criticized for having numerous glitches and having a general lack of polish.\n\nWhen I started playing LEGO: Harry Potter, I had some serious concerns. However, it looks like Traveler's Tales has gotten back to doing what they do best with LEGO Harry Potter, and the love that they put into this title definitely shows.\n\nRight from the moment you start the game, the affection the developers have for the series as a whole is apparent. The opening cutscene features a mish-mash of humorous takes on the opening scenes from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone mixed with a few nods to both the fans of the books as well as previous LEGO games. I won't spoil anything here, but it must be said that the cutscenes in LEGO Harry Potter are definitely on par with the best of the cutscenes from the LEGO: Star Wars series.\n\nThe cutscenes definitely continue the series' trademark humor, and the gameplay follows suit by providing users with more of the same puzzle-platform style of gameplay that has been featured in previous LEGO titles. Although this sounds a little disparaging, it's actually quite a boon for the game in this instance. The LEGO fanbase is one that must have some repetitious elements, especially when you consider that many of the players are quite young. Having a repetitious format may become tiresome in a game series designed for adults, but with a franchise with fans with single-digit ages, being able to hop right in and know what to do is key for success.\n\nThat's not to say, however, that there are no new elements in LEGO Harry Potter. Instead of a single action you can take with items in game, LEGO Harry Potter features more than ten special spells that you can use to achieve various effects in the game. These spells can be easily cycled through using the shoulder button, and add a new puzzle element to the game.\n\nAlthough there are quite a few spells (including the always-funny Ridikkulus spell), the one you are most likely to use in 90% of situations is Wingardium Leviosa. This levitation spell is the first spell you learn and will be used to move objects around and interact with switches. The Lumos spell is also used quite a bit, along with various graduated intervals of attack-style spells including Expecto Patronus and Incendio.\n\nAnd speaking of combat, there is a fair bit of magic-based fighting in LEGO Harry Potter. This is a change of pace from previous LEGO games, but it sits nicely with the overall tone of the game. The Harry Potter series of movies and books has always been well-known for its magical creatures and (at least in the beginning) fantastical battle sequences. Although boss battles generally do contain some amount of puzzling, you will be able to fire off magical spells from your wand fairly easily to overpower your opponent.\n\nLEGO Harry Potter does a great job of refreshing and updating the LEGO series for the Harry Potter universe, but unfortunately, there are several problems that remain. One of the problems that returns from other games is the camera. Though you may not notice it if you are playing co-op and staying close to your partner, if you are playing with an adventurous partner or with a bunch of AI-controlled characters, you'll notice the camera following the wrong character or zooming out to the point of near-unplayability.\n\nAnother thing that you must know coming in is that the best way to experience LEGO Harry Potter is with a friend. Playing by yourself can be quite an exercise in frustration, and AI-controlled characters can be painfully difficult to deal with, especially when you need to get them to a certain platform or area so you can proceed. Sure, you can always use your Wingardium Leviosa spell to get them in the correct position, but this can become quite the chore and make the game feel more like Hogwarts' babysitting service than a real adventure.\n\nA final complaint I have with this title is with the game's hub system. While hubs in previous LEGO titles have been expansive with plenty to explore, the Diagon Alley hub feels almost overwhelming. I had to search for several minutes just to find the character-purchase shop, and it felt like a chore going through the different areas, waiting for loading screens, and then tracking down who I needed to get new wardrobe choices, extra spells, or watch cutscenes. Though this may sound like a small gripe, I really relished the overall simplicity of previous games, and the complicated nature of the hub world just took away from the game's overall immersion.\n\nTechnically speaking, everything in Harry Potter maintains the status quo, which is a good thing. Cutscenes look polished, and in-game graphics maintain the signature brick-style that has become synonymous with the LEGO series. The only quibble I have with the game's visual styling (and it is a minor one) is that environments can get a little too busy at times and it can be hard to be precise with your targeting when you have dozens of interactive elements on screen. However, this only occurs in a handful of areas, and can usually be remedied by walking up to whatever element you want to interact with and targeting it directly (instead of just heading in the general direction and pressing a button.\n\nLEGO: Harry Potter Years 1-4 is certainly the best of the post-Star Wars LEGO games. The story material is handled wonderfully (though if you've never read the books or watched the movies, prepare to be lost), and the gameplay is a great mix of familiar devices and new elements. Although the inevitable follow-up to this title may take a darker turn, I look forward to experiencing it all the same.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 8, 2014","true","18.4"," 54 of 66 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","54","66","6","2"

Harry Potter or LEGO? Or building Harry Potter with LEGO?\nDoesn't matter though because the game combines both and that on PC.\nOver ten years ago I started reading the Harry Potter books and I had been playing with LEGO already even before I could read. I used to beg my mother to take me to the movies to see HP and it was the one thing I was looking forward to the most all the years. I had folders at home with every little piece of information there was to collect in newspapers and magazines. I had posters all over the wall and watched the movies regularily. My friends and I even replayed some of the scenes in our garden. I went to the midnight release of HP6 in a bookstore when I was maybe 10 and there was a picture of me in the local town's newspaper since I actually dressed up.\n\nI ♥♥♥♥ing cried after watching HP7.2 in the cinema because it felt as if I was losing part of myself (I was 15 be considerate). My childhood seemed to have reached its end with no more Harry Potter movies being in production.\n\nAnd years later I found out about this game. For the love of god, I cannot properly describe my happiness.\nLoosely keeping to the movies it still generates the general mood of the (earlier) ones. There are a lot of fun moments and it's even more enjoyable when you've got a friend over to play it with. It even includes the original soundtrack which just hits you right in your chest whenever a new piece starts.\n\nFor anyone having not yet played a LEGO game, you basically go through the chapters, sometimes being able to switch character, collecting LEGO money and shooting spells at everything you can point your wand at because, guess what, that gives you even more money. Later, when you replay a chapter, you can choose other people to play as who you unlock through the course of the game and who have different abilities and will let you enter new areas of the game.\n\nIf you like Harry Potter\nor if you like LEGO\nor even better\nif you like both\n\nGet this game, it's so damn worth it!","August 16, 2015","true","27.7"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","37","41","8","0"

Released in 2010, the game takes you though the first 4 books of the Harry Potter series; The Philosophers Stone(Sorcerer's Stone for US readers), the Chamber of Secrets, The Prisoner of Azkaban, and the Goblet of Fire. Several well known locations in the book series are available to visit in the game such as; Diagon Alley, the Leaky Cauldron, Gringotts, Hogsmead, and more. Explore Hogwarts, visit various classrooms to learn new spells, and unlock hidden secrets as you progress through the story. You even get to play Quidditch, and fly on a broomstick, so LEGO Harry Potter does not disappoint.\n\nYou will explore the Harry Potter Universe, solve puzzles and more.

Even knowing the overall story arc, does not take away from the fun you can have playing Lego Harry Potter, so if you enjoy the lego games, and are a fan of the Harry Potter series, this game is a must have for your library.

The only possibly way I can think of finishing the game is to rush through the levels so the autosave has a chance to save my progress before the next crash, which takes all the fun out the game.\n\nGood game.

This game is awesome!  Hillarious, smooth learning curve, great mix of aciton and cut scenes, and challenges are interesting though not particularly hard.  It all makes for a very fun expierence.  Plus, the whimsical nature of Harry Potter lends itself well to legos.\n\nThere are however a few issues that need to be overcome in order to play the game itself. In order of annoyance:\n1) Change your audio settings to 48kHz or lower or the game will crash every single time before it even loads.\n2) For the life of me I cannot get it to remember my graphics settings, so every time you open the program expect to take a seccond to set your resolution, vsync, AA, and other settings.\n3) To ensure stability, run the game in compatibility mode for WinXP.  I did not run into any issues personally, but it was suggested in several forums, and seems to be serving us well as we have not had any in-game glitches.\n4) As this is local co-op only then you will need 2 controllers, or be prepaired to have someone play on the keyboard... which is not a fun expierence.\n5) On the topic of controllers, it had no problem picking up the xbox 360 controller right away, but my 10 year old Saitek controller would loose it's key bindings on occasion.  It was rare, but if you plan on using a non Microsoft controller just be aware that you may need to rebind it from time to time.\n\nThese issues are a bit of a pain when you are first getting started, but the game is well worth the extra effort.","December 26, 2013","true","7.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Given the audience this is aimed at, none of the game is particularly hard, it's more about the fun behind the play. It's worth noting that while this game supports single players, you may be better off with using the standard two-player mode.\nIf you've played another lego film game, then this is in the same vein.\n\nThere is no voice acting here, but the game does use the harry potter soundtrack.\n\nThe graphics are fairly good in this game, with a mix of standard 3D game worlds interspersed with lego environments, all of which are destructible.\n\nI did encounter several crashes while playing this game, and this coupled with the very infrequent save poinyts makes for a very annoying experience. I narrowed this down to my laptop's power saving mode, which lends me to beleive that if your cpu is not being underclocked [as a powersaving measure] you should be fine.\n\nThis game is worth a buy if you like previou lego games of the harry potter movies. If you're not a fan of those, then you should probably stay away from this.","April 1, 2015","true","24.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I bought this on sale (luckily) so I don't feel like it's a complete loss, but if I had paid the full $20 to have glitches start very early on in the game I'd be OUTRAGED. I am disappointed because I was looking forward to this game and as I started playing I was having so much fun! Until I hit the part where you go into Harry's vault in Gringotts. I could only see a spell being cast, flames from some creature... basically just lights. I thought this was part of the game until no lights were fully switched on so that I could see what I was doing. I had to look up a walkthrough on YouTube and feel my way around to get OUT of that part. I even RESTARTED the game, got to the same point again only to find out it was still the same. I played further in (just a little) to encounter similar problems where I could get to one point and see everything just fine but moving slightly over or using "Wingardium Leviosa" on a light caused the screen to black out like it had before. I've read the negative reviews on this and I agree with them fully. This game is awesome, but BUY IT ON CONSOLE. Unfortunately for me, I do not have a single console, well other than SNES, to my name. Anyway... if you do buy for PC, just remember it's a risk. I will probably keep trying to play until I pull my hair out but that's because I still want to play.","September 21, 2014","false","26.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It's got that same LEGO charm and goofiness that we've all come to know and love since 2005's LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game. Parodying the first four Harry Potter movies (The Philosopher's Stone, The Chamber of Secrets, The Prisoner of Azkaban, and The Goblet of Fire), this game has the potential to bring new people into the Harry Potter fandom. It inspired me to watch the eight movies, and I must say that they're all wonderful. The puzzles in this game are clever, the satirical humor is an amazing thing to have considering how dark the movies get, and the idea of having the 'Dexter's Diner' and level select rooms as the Diagon Alley and Hogwarts Castle (respectively) overworlds are truly fantastic.\n\nBut, I'm afraid I can't give this game a perfect score like I would for other titles in the series. LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1 - 4 falls just short due to one fatal flaw in the game: Game breaking glitches.\n\nIn Year 3 Act 6, right near the beginning of the level, there are two switches that you need to hit to melt ice off a door to continue on. Hitting either of these crashes the game. But there is a workaround to it, thankfully. Just go into 2 player mode, place player 1 in a corner far away from a door, have player two hit the right switch, and have them drop out back to player 1. After waiting for a few minutes, do this again, but this time have player 2 take blind shots at the left switch, and then wait after you hit it. I know, it's convoluted and crazy, but it works. In the same level, there's a glass window that you need to break. The first time I tried to break it, the sound played but the entity in the map remained. This is fixed by a simple re-entering of the level, or restarting the game if you want to be sure. Just remember the glitch before that window.\n\nBut in Year 4 Act 2....there's a huge problem. The third dragon you take care of, a blue one, is supposed to be raised up on a platform whenever you walk onto a certain spot on the walkway on his cage. Instead of working like he should, he instead falls right through the platform. As this is a glitch in the physics engine for the game, I kept trying again but had the same result. But one time the dragon went through the ceiling of his cage. And another time, he worked. BUT, the fireball that he shoots teleported as soon as it left his mouth, and hit the back left corner of the platform. I had heard that you, again, needed to go into two player mode to get this to work. The first time it almost did, but then he went through the ceiling again. Which is, admittedly, kinda funny. But the other two tries just had the same result as the first time I encountered this glitch. As of yet, I have not found a workaround or fix in the files to remedy this problem.\n\nOverall, I give this game an 8/10, and highly recommend it to any fan of Harry Potter, or the LEGO games in general. But, for the time being, I would also recommend that you get it in physical form just in case the above glitches are Steam exclusive. I will edit my score later on should there ever be a patch released for this game that fixes the above glitches.","March 1, 2014","true","32.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fact that LEGO games can still feel refreshing is remarkable, especially when you're not a child but an adult. The fact that TT is able to accomplish all that is profound to some degree. And with each LEGO game, the smoothness and world building improves with each one.\n\nI know more recent LEGO games have had larger open worlds as their hub and with Harry Potter, or at least this one as I've yet to play Years 5-7, the hub is Hogwarts, and to an extent, The Leaky Cauldron and Diagon Alley. At the Leaky Cauldron, you have the classic hub set up where you can find extras and go shopping for upgrades in the Alley, meanwhile at Hogwarts, you follow the story and explore when possible. The one aspect of exloration in Hogwarts that I didn't find remarkable was how confined or limited it felt. There are only a few areas to go to and it's not like there are side quests that will want you to stick around, you'll probably just beat the story and uninstall the game, kind of like what I'm doing now.\n\nAnyway, it's still a good LEGO game.\n\n8.3/10","July 6, 2015","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is everything you expect from a LEGO game, from the silly little jokes to the frantic collecting of studs. As always, the abilities you unlock later in the game allow you to do cool stuff in the earlier levels, so you can play through the game multiple times! (This might also be a downside if you want to 100% the game but don't want to invest time into it). Overall, I would say together with Years 5-7 these games are the best Harry Potter games on the market. 8/10.","February 11, 2014","true","12.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Yes, there are some technical issues sometimes (game minimizing itself is one of mine), but I've never found them to be so invasive that I couldn't enjoy the game. The graphics are actually quite nice, the levels are big and there's lots to explore, and the characters are fun. I love the dialogue-free thing (who REALLY likes sitting there for five minutes listening to dialogue when you've already read the subtitles?) and the fact that there are little jokes put in from time to time that provide some nice comic relief.\n\nThis game tends to keep you in a good mood because of its humour and the fact that it isn't extremely difficult. As far as I can tell, it is very, very hard to die in this game (at least in the first few levels--I can't speak for the later ones as I haven't played them yet), so that provides some relief for gamers who are reaching the end of their patience after getting killed dozens of times on the same level of their favourite more difficult games. You also seem to get a lot of reward for a little effort. Run around hitting things with spells left and right and you're amply rewarded with coins. In these ways, LEGO Harry Potter is definitely a kids' game but not so much that an adult who loves Harry Potter can't enjoy it, especially an adult who doesn't always want to be stuck playing the typical violent, bloody FPS all the time.\n\nI can also see how this would be fun to play with a friend if you have a controller or two. The multiplayer option is always there--you don't have to play any special mode to enjoy co-op play--so your friend can jump in to help you out (or make things more difficult, depending on the friend) anytime.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend LEGO Harry Potter to anyone who likes the series. It's purely a fun, enjoyable game with nice little jokes thrown in. It'll make you smile and give you hours of fun for not too much money.","July 3, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Building with magic, lessons to get new spells etc. anything a HP fan would wish for really to have in a game and i just had a blast smashing up objects with my wand around Hogwarts, so fun! If your into HP, i would strongly reccomend you play this as you can literally relive your favourite moments if your new however, you should give it a go when it goes in sale and maybe you will make some new favourite moments! =)  However, there is 1 problem that i need to address which im sure many of you are aware of which is the Dark Tower level on Year 3 where when you shoot the gargoyles after watering the plants, the game wil crash. To fix this you can go into pcconfig, explained here:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/21130/discussions/0/541907867766148247/\n\nOr like i did, work your way around it which is: to get Hermione off screen away from Harry so in the corner as you drop down worked for me (this is when he is near the Gargoyles) get her to have Crookshanks out, quickly change to Harry, shoot the gargoyle(s) (i did one at a time as 2 of them) then quickly change back to Hermione as apprently, the animation causes it to crash so it can't crash if camera is on Hermione. Thanks to people on here and YouTube for these solutions as i really did not want to have to end at year 3 XD now Years 5-7 for me :D   but i will come back to 100% this game at somepoint! =)","November 21, 2015","true","30.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

My review of this may be slightly nostalgia-biased, due to countless hours of playing this on my Wii, but I will try to be as honest as possible.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic; it is a LEGO game after all.  The game has puzzles, some moderate action and is overall quite enjoyable.  The puzzles aren't anything too mind blowing, they're pretty standard for anyone who's played a LEGO game: Smash a couple things here, use a special ability there.  However, the controls do not support the mouse and will reset to defaults upon restarting the game, so I would highly reccomend the use of a gamepad; it makes life easier.\n\nAs far as graphics go the game is quite well optimized and looks pretty great; the screenshots on the store page do it absolutely no good.  With my current PC, (R9-280, 8GB of RAM and an FX-6300) I am getting a framerate of around 350 frames per second with all settings maxed at 1080p.  The game seems to compensate for its mediocre shading and texturing with some decent depth of field, bloom, and motion blur.  Some may argue that those effects are simply put in place to cover up bad graphics, however that's exactly what they do; The post processing effects cover up mediocre graphics, which is fine in my book.  The game looks great, and provides incredible performance.\n\nFun?  Absolutely.  It's a LEGO game for christ's sake!  There is little more fun than running around smashing everything in sight and flinging spells aimlessly around Hogwarts.  The perfect game for any Harry Potter fan who is a child at heart.\n\nAspect        Score                Gameplay        7.5                Graphics        8                Fun        9.5\nOverall Score: 8.3\n\nWarning:  go into your Windows playback device settings and change the default format to 24 bit @ 48000 Hz, the game will crash on startup otherwise.","October 26, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

However, I purchased it so I could play a game with my eldest son and in that regard it has not disappointed as it really is great fun as a coop game.\n\nThe game plays in 2D with depth and your view is from the side looking slightly down.\n\nYou control one character at a time with various characters available depending on where you are. You can switch between characters to make use of the different abilities available to each character with the computer controlling the non-player controlled characters and basically just moving them along with you.\n\nThe puzzles whilst not always logically solved (at least in my mind) are generally good fun, although a few are a bit tedious in that it seems to me its just a case of trying just about everything you can think of and the final solution simply has no logical reason why it should work behind it other than it does work. I also found some of the boss battles a bit tedious, e.g. final boss at end of level 2.\n\nAs only a casual follower of the Harry Potter films the game seems to keep close enough to the storyline for me to relate it to the film.\n\nOn the basis of playing this game I am purchasing other lego games as they come on sale with a view to playing those with my son too.\n\nProsCoop\nThe split screen works well if the characters are separated in coop mode\nReasonably faithful to the film plot\nNice gentle humourConsAwkward user interface\nOccasionally the game seemed to lose connection with the controllers and I've not experienced this in other games but not played enough games with two controllers to be sure the problem is only with thsi game\nYou have to complete a level to save the game\nI found gauging where a character was depth wise on the screen a little difficultMarks Out Of 5\n5) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this\n4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase\n3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted\n1) Not worth getting even if given away free\n\nWhere I got the game from\nI paid £2.08 on  Uplay [uplay.ubi.com]\n\nPlatform Played On\nIntel Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition, 8Gb RAM, Palit GTX 750, Windows 10, XBOX Controller For PC","September 26, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Maybe it's characteristic for LEGO games in general, I don't know (I bought this one for my kid only because it was Harry Potter), but here you are:\n\n- not playable without a controller;\n- no voice acting;\n- more than a few liberties taken with the plot and the universe of HP.\n\nIf you are ok with all of the above, go ahead and get it.

I must say LOTR is awesome action pack and I love it whereas HP in my opinion was boring BS. I gave Harry Potter 90minutes and as a fan of the series I really tried to like the game. I played it with xbox360 controller it's one of the rare games where keyboard is actually worse, mainly because mouse has no function. So everyone playing lego games controller is THAT much bettter.\n\nThe first 90 minutes made me first of all hate the coin collecting. First I thought you need to collect them to be able to buy stuff. I still don't know if you can buy stuff, but I hate destroying everything and collecting the coin explosions. Tbh I think there is no actual benefit for it other than 100% completion.\n\nI was able to learn the first levitation spell at my first magic class and the spell system is not my cup of tee. I think holding X and aiming a crosshair at some torches and bookshelves and whatnot is kinda lame. The character switching is stupid when the inactive character always runs back to harry potter (who is rarely playable and useless character mostly during my 90 minutes in). The extra characters would be fun I guess with friends to co-op, but they really should follow you around rather than returning to room/area entrance which in some cases is very far away.\n\nThe puzzles were pretty boring especially levitating bits and pieces and most of all Scabbers puzzles were lame. Students in peril... LAME. I didn't get into any real action except for pulling chains and opening locks... and collect more coins. I would also like to have character names visible since these lego guys aren't always that recognizable. That was more of a problem in LOTR with the four hobbits, but also a negative in HP.\n\nI bet it gets more interesting after more hours, but for me this game did not deliver. And I may compare too much to LEGO Lord of the rings that delivered instantly and was action packed action game with real voice actors. Potter characters speak gipperish and made it childish and ruined the fun for me. Even the LEGO jokes felt awkward with Harry Potter mumbling. The jokes do work in LOTR when there is real voice acting and the atmosphere in cinematics is fantastic.\n\nOn a scale 0-5 I would give harry potter 1.5 and LOTR would get 4.","November 10, 2014","false","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

There is not that much places that you can go, but still made me feel disoriented and I've made myself a mental map to know where was i. Even knowing that there is not that much to go, they made it in a way that i almost didn't care, which is nice.\n7/10\n\nStory:\nThey've cut a lot of the 4th year... the whole ball... NOT EVEN A CUTSCENE DDD:\nWell, frustrations aside, they've made some changes from the original movie(s) just to make it "comic". I know this supposed to be a kid's game, but Harry Potter story isn't something very... kids safe... but... well, ♥♥♥♥it. Like i was saying, those changes doesn't affect the story that much and some changes had to be made to save time and not to make the game too long, but all the other parts were quite accurate.\n8/10\n\nGameplay:\nAI sometimes can ♥♥♥♥ you up, but is very well programed for the other parts, and if you play this game as it should be played (no exploits nor glitches) you'll have no problems with AI. Even in parts where two players need to separate in order to complete a puzzle.\nAI 9/10\nThe controls can give you a hard time if you want to finish this game quickly... the spell selection is kinda of confusing and messy (Xbox 360 controller) but... you get usued to.\nControl 6/10\nThe spell detection sucks... you want to cast a Leviosa on a purple thing and then you are levitating Ron. To kinda "fix" this, they've made a manual target. But still... even with the target on the purple thing, sometimes it doesn't recognizes the object's purple aura.\nSpell detection 3/10\nCharacter control is fine... not perfect due camera angles and some leviosa's sensitivity, but it does the job.\nCharacter control 6/10\nAction detection: i don't know what is worse, spell detection or action detection... when you want to put the skelleton arm in the cauldron, you have to be almost inside the ♥♥♥♥ing thing... when you want to use your pet two passes away from the cauldron, you get teleported to the ♥♥♥♥ing cauldron...\nAction detection 2/10\n\nOverall gameplay 7/10\n\nSound:\nCan't tell a lot, but the soundtrack is like the one in the movie(s). BUT it doen't have a big collection, so you hear the same music in Hogwarts over and over and over and over again. I like the music from Harry Potter, but who isn't a fan and really pay attention to soundtrack is going to get bored really quick.\nSound effects are ok, not much variation either.\n7/10\n\nExtras:\nThis is where i've spend the most time playing. There are a lot of things to collect in Hogwarts and if you want to complete 100% or not, i really recommend getting at least all character tokens. It makes you explore the whole castle and see all the other parts that were really well done and with a lot of details. Some parts of the castle you wouldn't even know it exists because just playing Story Mode doesn't give you the complete hogwarts experience.\nThere are some collectibles that are really a pain to find (Students in Peril) and if you want to get 100%, you have to play the game twice (one in story mode and one in free play).\n9/10\n\nOther things:\nA few glitch here and there, but nothing serious. EXCEPT for the save file. This is the worst type of save system that could exist. I've said that you have to complete the game twice to get 100%, well, i've completed 6 times because of the poor checkpoint system, only one save file that is easily corruptible, no cloud save, file location is "hidden" and you can't force a save... only when you get a token, get a golden brick, a red brick, save a student or finish a story sequence. I've got so frustrated the first time that i was 82% and then all the sudden, my save got currupted. I've waited another holiday season to play it again. If you are trying 100%, I recommend creating backup files every time you see the auto save icon.\nThis is easy a 5h game or 22h 100% game.\n\nOverall:\nIt's a nice casual game that makes you want to complete 100% and gets you addicted quite fast.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misaki-chan/recommended/21130/","misaki-chan","水谷 雫","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misaki-chan/","107 products in account","My review will be based in a few things:\n1 - I Love Hairy Petter and Hairy Petter games\n2 - I Finished 100% of the game\n3 - I've played with an Xbox 360 controller\n4 - I'm not a native english speaker\n5 - This is my first review\n\nLet's start õ/\n\nLike I said, I love Harry Potter and I kinda like Lego games... so this was very interesting.\n\nGraphics:\nNothing special, but they have done a great job recreating the cenario\n7/10\n\nCenario Immersion:\nSometimes it feels empty, almost no interaction with the castle except for the parts that you must interact to continue the game. There is not that much places that you can go, but still made me feel disoriented and I've made myself a mental map to know where was i. Even knowing that there is not that much to go, they made it in a way that i almost didn't care, which is nice.\n7/10\n\nStory:\nThey've cut a lot of the 4th year... the whole ball... NOT EVEN A CUTSCENE DDD:\nWell, frustrations aside, they've made some changes from the original movie(s) just to make it "comic". I know this supposed to be a kid's game, but Harry Potter story isn't something very... kids safe... but... well, ♥♥♥♥it. Like i was saying, those changes doesn't affect the story that much and some changes had to be made to save time and not to make the game too long, but all the other parts were quite accurate.\n8/10\n\nGameplay:\nAI sometimes can ♥♥♥♥ you up, but is very well programed for the other parts, and if you play this game as it should be played (no exploits nor glitches) you'll have no problems with AI. Even in parts where two players need to separate in order to complete a puzzle.\nAI 9/10\nThe controls can give you a hard time if you want to finish this game quickly... the spell selection is kinda of confusing and messy (Xbox 360 controller) but... you get usued to.\nControl 6/10\nThe spell detection sucks... you want to cast a Leviosa on a purple thing and then you are levitating Ron. To kinda "fix" this, they've made a manual target. But still... even with the target on the purple thing, sometimes it doesn't recognizes the object's purple aura.\nSpell detection 3/10\nCharacter control is fine... not perfect due camera angles and some leviosa's sensitivity, but it does the job.\nCharacter control 6/10\nAction detection: i don't know what is worse, spell detection or action detection... when you want to put the skelleton arm in the cauldron, you have to be almost inside the ♥♥♥♥ing thing... when you want to use your pet two passes away from the cauldron, you get teleported to the ♥♥♥♥ing cauldron...\nAction detection 2/10\n\nOverall gameplay 7/10\n\nSound:\nCan't tell a lot, but the soundtrack is like the one in the movie(s). BUT it doen't have a big collection, so you hear the same music in Hogwarts over and over and over and over again. I like the music from Harry Potter, but who isn't a fan and really pay attention to soundtrack is going to get bored really quick.\nSound effects are ok, not much variation either.\n7/10\n\nExtras:\nThis is where i've spend the most time playing. There are a lot of things to collect in Hogwarts and if you want to complete 100% or not, i really recommend getting at least all character tokens. It makes you explore the whole castle and see all the other parts that were really well done and with a lot of details. Some parts of the castle you wouldn't even know it exists because just playing Story Mode doesn't give you the complete hogwarts experience.\nThere are some collectibles that are really a pain to find (Students in Peril) and if you want to get 100%, you have to play the game twice (one in story mode and one in free play).\n9/10\n\nOther things:\nA few glitch here and there, but nothing serious. EXCEPT for the save file. This is the worst type of save system that could exist. I've said that you have to complete the game twice to get 100%, well, i've completed 6 times because of the poor checkpoint system, only one save file that is easily corruptible, no cloud save, file location is "hidden" and you can't force a save... only when you get a token, get a golden brick, a red brick, save a student or finish a story sequence. I've got so frustrated the first time that i was 82% and then all the sudden, my save got currupted. I've waited another holiday season to play it again. If you are trying 100%, I recommend creating backup files every time you see the auto save icon.\nThis is easy a 5h game or 22h 100% game.\n\nOverall:\nIt's a nice casual game that makes you want to complete 100% and gets you addicted quite fast. Even with this save problem, the game is well done in general and i had a lot of fun playing it alone.\nI recommend this to a Lego games fan or a Harry Potter fan.\n7/10","November 17, 2015","true","58.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Now, I am at year 4 chapter 2, and can't even get the level to load without it just going to a black screen that I can't even alt+tab out of (meaning I have to restart my whole computer), so I can't finish the game. The game came out six years ago, so there is no chance of Traveller's Tales of ♥♥♥♥ing fixing it. And, since I've had it longer than two weeks and played it more than two hours, I'm not elligible for a refund.

I've had my share of problems and bugs, playing with an xbox control was a pain in the butt sometimes as the connection would just drop out, and the game would glitch really badly if I used spells too fast.

You can play together on one PC.\nBut my assessment is due to the 2 bugs:\n- At the level of the dragon blue dragon may fall under the area which it raises and will have to pass the level from the knitted.\n- At the level of the tower with the Dementors, at the top, after watering the flowers, you need to get to the statue to fall, the game freezes and crashes. Corrected hit without seeing the fire, spewing a statue, or a reduction in lighting to a bare minimum in the game files.\n\n\n\n950 из 1000 баллов.\nИгра хорошая, можно проходить много часов, неповторимая лего графика, удобный геймплей, полно различных персонажей, за которых можно поиграть. Так же можно поиграть вдвоём на одном ПК.\nНо моя оценка такова из-за 2 багов:\n- на уровне с драконами синий дракон может провалиться под площадь, которая его поднимает и придётся проходить уровень с самого заного.\n- на уровне на башне с Дементорами, вверху, после полива цветов, нужно попасть в статую, попадаем, игра виснет и вылетает. Исправляется попаданием не видя огня, извергаемого статуей, или снижением освещения до самого минимума в файлах игры.","January 7","true","43.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay mechanics are so offensively simple that I don't see anybody enjoying themselves while playing it. And don't be mistaken, it's not like they simplified the game in some areas in order to appeal to the younger audience, no. They simply designed this piece of ♥♥♥♥ without any depth what so ever, none. It's just so plain and so unintuitive in everything it does. It became so basic in the ways it approaches things that there's no enjoyment to be had once you actually manage to complete a level. Flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ broomstick doesn't feel any different to walking.\n\nThere's no point in using your brain at all while playing this game, in the end you'll still be forced to just run around for a minute or two, smashing everything around you in order to get enough scrap to build the thing that can help you proceed to the next room. There's nothing smart about it, nothing clever. In their efforts to secure the highest profit margin possible they produced an experience without any substance, just a long, tiring series of corridors, fetch quests and weak - ♥♥♥ HP references.\n\nIf you're looking for a engaging expereince to enjoy with your youngsters, please, PLEASE, look further, avoid this game at all costs, even if you are a fan of the HP universe.","May 14","false","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The error message I receive is " Fatal Error! Failed to create d3d device. Application will now exit. Error = 0x8876086c". I have triple checked my graphics drivers are up to date (ATI Mobility Radeon HD5470), I have tried various fixes that are on forums etc, even the audio fix, and the fix to adjust the config file for the games resolution on start-up. But nothing. Nothing seems to fix this problem. I have never had this problem before, all my other games work 100% and LEGO Lord of The Rings works 100% every time. I downloading a Lego HP 1-4 demo to see if I got the same problem and YES it has the exact same issue so it's nothing to do with Steam. I also bought years 5-7 in the sale so I will install that and see if I have the problem with that game, too.\n\n[UPDATE]\n\nLEGO Harry Potter years 5-7 works 100% perfectly fine (although 720p it wants only to run windowed? which is weird) anyway, this clearly shows that Harry Potter years 1-4 has something terribly wrong with it, maybe it hates Windows 7? maybe it hates Radeon cards? I don't know. But I also found out that these games have no dialogues and the characters just make noises.... which is horrificly annoying.

This game could have been a lot simpler just by having the same game controls for the two characters and a tab function to move between the two characters.\n\nThis game was definitely made for a console where two controllers could be used. Glad I bought the game when it was on sale as I won't be playing purely as the controls were silly.\n\nMy advice if you want this game just save the hassle of silly controls and buy it was the console ratherthan for PC.","January 5, 2014","false","0.6"," 0 of 10 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","10","0","0"

A lot of issues. Seriously, what is it with LEGO Games and game breaking glitches? I was often blocked off from some parts of the levels because of glitches and had to restart the game. Also, the controls aren't optimized very well for the KB+M. There's no mouse support and they'll refer to your WASD keys as "Left Stick". That's how bad it is. Just use a controller.\n\n\nHowever, all the unpatched glitches aside, it's not a bad game. It has the spirit of every other LEGO game, which is going around and building stuff. It's a game about creativity, and they couldn't have chosen a better setting than Hogwarts to let people explore in.\n\nKeep in mind that this is heavily reflected in many of the "puzzles", too. The puzzles in this game aren't about testing your intuition. They're about innovation and creativity. Often when you are stuck on something that appears to be a puzzle, the answer is actually to BUILD something. It's not just about the LEGO aethetics, it's about the mindset. Looking at you, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes >.>\n\nAs far as the game's CONTENT goes, Hogwarts is actually a fun place to explore in the game, but it's very small and confusing to navigate, which necessitates Nearly Headless Nick holding your hand throughout the entire game.\n\nI'd give the game a 7/10 because I enjoyed it and thought it was crafted together very well for what it was supposed to accomplish.","April 4, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game was just so poorly implimented it almost dies. The only way of cobatting this is to force close the game (Due to the frame drops and unresponsive controls in this state, you cant even access the escape menu. You then have to retart the game and then hope that it doesn't start-up like it was a few minutes ago. Just terrible. I usually enjoy LEGO games as they are very different from everything else i play. But this one is making it almost impossible to enjoy. Also to add some of the very basic mechanics of the game do not work whilst the game drops, its not like the computer skips frames, the game just barely runs. (Personally, i dont call it running) Its actually infuriating, that a company/developer of this size simply cannot get the game to work... and there is no sure way to fix. The developer doesnt appear to even acknowledge that this is an issue. I've even tried installing this on my SSD (Samsung 840 Evo) this doesn't change a thing. Some people suggest that it may be related to the allocated RAM for the game. However there is no surity in any answer. (5 Years old....)

There are 6 levels in each year, along with some mucking about around the Hogwarts free-roam. Unfortunately, each story feels shorter than the last, seeing as there is a big difference between the amount of play in Year 1 and the amount of play in Year 4. Also, Goblet of Fire doesn't really feel like it fits in, seeing as it's about 2 hours of gameplay right at the end.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nAs you go on your journey, you'll unlock a full range of spells:\n\nExpelliarmus\n\nRiddikulus\n\nExpecto Patronum\n\nLumos/Lumos Solem\n\nWingardium Leviosa\n\nImmobulus\n\nReducto\n\nPlus the ability to summon a pet, turn into an Animagus or use a magical item.\n\nThe levels can be quite short, and you generally just use the spells to solve puzzles and, often in Year 4, defeat enemies.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThe graphics are OK, but Years 5-7 has the upper hand.\n\nFREE ROAM\n\nYou can explore all areas of Hogwarts Castle eventually (you unlock most of the areas in Year 1, a few in Year 2, a few in Year 3 and a few in Year 4. Plenty of stuff to keep you busy, like saving Students in Peril and hunting for new characters.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI may have said some bad points of this game, but it's still a nice little package of Harry Potter magic.\n\n1) Essential Purchase\n2)Recommended Purchase\nRecommended during a sale4)Not recommended unless heavily discounted\n5)Not recommended even for hardcore Steam gamers","March 19","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Apart from the annoying radios you get that nice Harry Potter feeling.\n\nHint: Deactivate detectors you no longer need or you might have a bad time - looking at you, Crest Detector.\nHint: I recommend playing through the game once in order to get all the abilities\n\n+ Harry Potter feeling, Hogwarts + music\n+ Destroying and building\n+ Score multiplicators\n+ X Detectors\n0 Mostly tight controls\n0 Some 3D jumping with on-rail camera\n0 No voice acting\n- Vanishing rewards + unavailable rewards\n- That buggy Crest Detector\n\nIt's a LEGO game so you destroy the environment to rebuild whatever you need to progress.\nOn the first run-through it's a bit irritating to see all the stuff that you cannot use yet. If you aim for completeness you basically have to re-run levels. Besides the levels and connecting them is Hogwarts castle. You often have to progress in one to progress in the other. Finding important stuff gets easier as you discover the hidden detectors and paying for them gets easier with the equally hidden score multiplier - score translating directly to money.\nThe controls are pretty tight apart from the occasional unintentional spell marker and the rare jumping towards or away from the camera - nothing rage-worthy. The camera follows you around the levels sort of on rails and can be nudged a little bit in each direction.\nSince the game is a bit older there is no voice acting but you're still well-directed and if you know Harry Potter than you likely have a good idea what's about to happen.\nI generally dislike when games employ vanishing rewards - here the coins dropping from destruction vanish in seconds. I understand that games don't want to track every coin in all the levels but at least give me time to finish the scene.\nBesides the timed vanishing, coins are sometimes simply dropped behind a wall or into the abyss and thus unavailable to the (early) player.","December 14, 2015","true","76.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since there is no voice acting in this game, it's pretty important to know the Harry Potter story well, otherwise you won't get the best experience. The game tells the story of first 4 years of Harry Potter, mixing in some great humoristic elements.\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty simple but fun. It can get quite repetitive after some time, but it's good fun to play through for some simple entertainment.

There are 6 levels in each year, along with some mucking about around the Hogwarts free-roam. Unfortunately, each story feels shorter than the last, seeing as there is a big difference between the amount of play in Year 1 and the amount of play in Year 4. Also, Goblet of Fire doesn't really feel like it fits in, seeing as it's about 2 hours of gameplay right at the end.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nAs you go on your journey, you'll unlock a full range of spells:\n\nExpelliarmus\n\nRiddikulus\n\nExpecto Patronum\n\nLumos/Lumos Solem\n\nWingardium Leviosa\n\nImmobulus\n\nReducto\n\nPlus the ability to summon a pet, turn into an Animagus or use a magical item.\n\nThe levels can be quite short, and you generally just use the spells to solve puzzles and, often in Year 4, defeat enemies.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThe graphics are OK, but Years 5-7 has the upper hand.\n\nFREE ROAM\n\nYou can explore all areas of Hogwarts Castle eventually (you unlock most of the areas in Year 1, a few in Year 2, a few in Year 3 and a few in Year 4. Plenty of stuff to keep you busy, like saving Students in Peril and hunting for new characters.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI may have said some bad points of this game, but it's still a nice little package of Harry Potter magic.\n\n1) Essential Purchase\n2)Recommended Purchase\nRecommended during a sale4)Not recommended unless heavily discounted\n5)Not recommended even for hardcore Steam gamers","March 19","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This time riding on the first four Harry Potter movies. Released in 2010, made by Traveller's Tales, published by Warner Bros. It also came out for Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, NDS, PSP and iOS.\nOut of ports the only notable ones are NDS, PSP and iOS ones. It's a different game, more like isometric exploration of small levels where you do quests for characters. While collecting studs.\n\nTechnically, this PC version is known to be a pretty badly done. Actually, this game is full of glitches on any platforms. You can google out a whole list of them. It actually might be useful to check one out, to know what to avoid.\nPersonally, I had no problems with this game. But I didn't try to 100% it anyway. I only once had trouble with making game recognise controller, so I had to restart PC. And it crashed once.\nBut there are just way too many reposts of real nasty glitches. Some can't make it start without crash. Other experienced losing a save! And many also have game freezing in Year 3 on Dark Tower level when activating one of the gargoyles that shoot fire. I didn't had trouble, but I played this stage only once. But the solution seem to indiacate that it something to do with rendering dynamic light. You either activate it off-screen or change config file of a game. Just check on guides.\n\nAs for gameplay itself, it's yet another Traveller's Tales lego game. It's like lego game, but with all stuff that lego sequels get. Be casual, have infinite lives, collect-a-thon, do simple puzzles. It's getting stale and writing Steam reviews on them is getting stale too.\nActually, well, this time is different, because Harry Potter is the franchise I am familar with and love. Read books, you see. And then 50 years later I will be sitting with my kids and explain them how awesome it was. And then I will realize that everybody read books too and Warner is still making money with more Harry Potter stuff.\n\nPlot isn't all that changed. Lego figures still don't speak. So it's recommended to watch movies first, really. Well, okay, plot was changed a bit so there is always at least two characters to control at any time, so you can always have fun with a friend.\n\nAnd actually, I like this LEGO iteration. There are almost no annoying fights with respawning enemies which is a huge plus in these earlier LEGO games. It's more puzzle focused than that. I also actually laughed a few times. The world here is much more lively, combining levels and hub around pretty nice. You can even get another "collectable" - "Student in peril". Help somebody out of sticky situation and feel good about it. No more ledge jumping, more of spell-choosing and aiming. It also felt like I was restricted from less stuff in Story Mode than in previous LEGO games, you can get more stuff the first time around with what is given to you.\n\nProtip: To destroy the monster books, you have to come close and press Tag button for some reason.\n\nEh. It's nice. For me this whole Lego franchise got stale, as I tried to beat it in chronological order and beat Star Wars, two Indiana and the first Batman. But for those who didn't play much of Lego games this one will be nice. Actually, looking at it again, it is good as part of franchise too, as I realize that I had less frustration due to Lego Harry Potter having less respawning enemies. But watch out for all the glitches!","January 20","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Why the frig did they release this to PC without sorting these crappy errors, shame on whoever did it, it's soul destroying when it's a genre the kids love and it doesn't do the basic function of staying active whilst the user is trying to play.\n8/10 for the levels and gameplay\n1/10 for the core engine that fails 2-3 times everytime we play. Until we get fed up and leave it another week.","January 24","false","22.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Apart from the annoying radios you get that nice Harry Potter feeling.\n\nHint: Deactivate detectors you no longer need or you might have a bad time - looking at you, Crest Detector.\nHint: I recommend playing through the game once in order to get all the abilities\n\n+ Harry Potter feeling, Hogwarts + music\n+ Destroying and building\n+ Score multiplicators\n+ X Detectors\n0 Mostly tight controls\n0 Some 3D jumping with on-rail camera\n0 No voice acting\n- Vanishing rewards + unavailable rewards\n- That buggy Crest Detector\n\nIt's a LEGO game so you destroy the environment to rebuild whatever you need to progress.\nOn the first run-through it's a bit irritating to see all the stuff that you cannot use yet. If you aim for completeness you basically have to re-run levels. Besides the levels and connecting them is Hogwarts castle. You often have to progress in one to progress in the other. Finding important stuff gets easier as you discover the hidden detectors and paying for them gets easier with the equally hidden score multiplier - score translating directly to money.\nThe controls are pretty tight apart from the occasional unintentional spell marker and the rare jumping towards or away from the camera - nothing rage-worthy. The camera follows you around the levels sort of on rails and can be nudged a little bit in each direction.\nSince the game is a bit older there is no voice acting but you're still well-directed and if you know Harry Potter than you likely have a good idea what's about to happen.\nI generally dislike when games employ vanishing rewards - here the coins dropping from destruction vanish in seconds. I understand that games don't want to track every coin in all the levels but at least give me time to finish the scene.\nBesides the timed vanishing, coins are sometimes simply dropped behind a wall or into the abyss and thus unavailable to the (early) player.","December 14, 2015","true","76.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Little bits of humour. The camera angles aren't great, it's all fixed camera which is quite annoying t begin with but you get used to it. Personally, I wish there were a more adult and authentic version of Harry Potter as a video game, but that doesn't mean this one isn't good. Perfect for younger audiences, but I enjoyed it being an adult and I'm sure many others will. Sadly this doesn't have achievements which I think is really sad.","December 15, 2015","true","43.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a pretty by-the-numbers Lego game, but that's what we're here for, right? There are a few guide-dang-it moments and reaching 100% completion will either mean a lot of back-tracking or a guide, but it's very achievable for any age group or skill level.\n\nI did have some graphical issues, but they were pretty rare - the cut-scenes use the in-game models, and sometimes they would go all fractal. Minimizing the game would usually fix this. Also, you really need a controller for Lego games - the keyboard will make you crazy.\n\nOne last thing - I just can't figure out why they didn't use the "kid" model mini-figs that we've seen in other Lego games.
