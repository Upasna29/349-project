Now that you've all breathed your collective sigh of "ugh, another Unity title", let me go on by saying that Pointless can be summed up in one word, boring. Yes, this game is utterly boring; in fact, it's probably the most dull game I've ever played, and I've played some real doozies.\n\nFirst off, when I opened the game nothing worked. I found out that this was because I chose to resize the tiny window using the "maximize" box instead of using my cursor to resize the square. If you hit the maximize box instead, the game doesn't understand your cursor axis anymore. After a couple of minutes of scratching my head, I figured it out and went on with the gameplay.\n\nYou start off with one dot. You click the dot. Two dots then appear. Rinse and repeat until hundreds of dots appear. The game also randomly spawns different "weapons" to use, such as a lazer (the best, in my opinion), bombs, a wide dot smasher, and more. However, the game can't really handle all the dots that it spawns and when more than about a hundred dots are on the screen, or when you're smashing them too fast, Pointless lags like crazy. The more dots you smash, the higher your score, the more palettes you unlock for your "Game Gal"; a whopping 11 of 'em. You can also contribute your score to a "global score" by simply clicking the option in the main menu.\n\nThat's pretty much it. You click dots, the dots multiply, you use weapons to smash more dots. I'd rather go back and play Her Story multiple times over than this piece of Unity poo that can't handle a few pixels. Pointless is just another cruddy clicker "edgy" indie cash grab that depletes the longevity of your mouse and clogs up the arteries of Steam with its boring, drab "gameplay". Avoid, even at a buck... just avoid it; it seems like someones college assignment that they decided to make money off of.\n\nRating: 0.5/5.0 - Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","February 22","false","1.0"," 92 of 119 people (77%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","77","92","119","11","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/recommended/442290/","apochweiss","ApochsDotNet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/","1843 products in account","tl;dr: Game's literally pointless with god awful hit detection. For details, continue reading:\n\n'Pointless' is a game all about clicking dots, and no, it's just not that simple. Not because it isn't simple, but because it isn't programmed to be simple. Not because it's clearly intentional. But because the programming just basically sucks. And you know it does when the first thing you're greeted with is a mock Gameboy screen meant to bring up nostalgia of a two-bit variety, only making the game look cheap and completely unoriginal, not to mention make you want to pull out that old brick of a portable handheld instead of play this. On top of that you have a repetitive score and random sound effects that mirror that system's capabilities, yet quickly grate on your nerves the more time you spend listening to them. Honestly, some of the cheap knock-off handheld companies back in the day had higher standards, though the Nintendo today may be willing to slap it up on their DS/3DS e-store.\n\nOf course the huge problem about this title becomes immediately apparent with the first click of the mouse once the actual "game" starts, and that is the hit detection is pure garbage. No, I wasn't just sitting here clicking tiny dots on a filthy laptop screen, though I admit it did happen more times than I'd like to admit to, but I found myself clicking upwards of twenty times rapid fire to get one single dot, only to watch it vanish and be forced to move on to the next in hopes of actually gaining that one point. In just ten seconds I conceded it'd just be easier to sit around waiting for the L power-up to show so I could have a little fun with it without the use of an auto-clicker hotkey script running in the background in a feeble attempt to rack up achievements to my Steam account.\n\nOn top of that, 'Pointless' has no penalty system in place, so sitting around in no way hinders your progress. You're best bet is to just click and use one of five weapons, only three of which seem to have any real use. Pulse places three pulsating obstacles on the screen at points of your choice and, if done right, will spread the dots and rack up thousands in one go. Bomb is nice if you have a number of clustered dots on screen as well. But then you have laser, which is the most enjoyable, allowing you to hold the left mouse button down and automatically click. This one is best done by making small circular motions to rack up a decent amount of dots. These three work very well together if done right as well, but long (black rectangle that crushes dots) has minimal benefit. There's also chain, but I genuinely have no idea what it does, if anything at all.\n\nThere are a few options, but they are as basic, and disappointing, as the title itself. There's music and sound effect volume controls, as well as an option to change the background "color palette", but only after you destroy so many dots to unlock the other two distinctly bland colors of peach and tomato red. Yes, that's all the cosmetic changes the development team has allowed. God forbid you get a third color scheme to unlock or new "game girl" handheld border because  us clicking pointlesly at pointless dots wouldn't possibly know what to do with that much power at our disposal other than watch the credits and add our pointless total to a pointless global score to show the world how collectively pathetic we as Steam users are in this day and age.\n\nThankfully for achievement hunters, these are simple to rack up with some help. If you have an auto-clicker program or a script that runs in Hotkey, something I wound up abusing by the six thousand dot mark and realized how little I could be bothered to try to click the many fleas infesting the digital handheld device that wouldn't die even when I properly clicked on them in the first damn place. You can scoff at the idea but, trust me, it's almost necessary to do this since you have to have the game the active window at all times in order to get any weapons or new dots to appear on the screen.\n\n'Flea Extermination Simulator 2016' is, well, a thing that exists. Is it a game? Not necessarily. Remember the old 'Game & Watch' style of handheld games? Well just picture a bunch of fleas somehow got into one of those, and it's up to you to exterminate them all before they take over your house. This is 'Pointless', both in title and execution. The only goal this title serves is to add another cheap and quick one hundred percent complete title to the list of Steam games with achievements. Sadly, without caving and using an auto-clicker, you'll find it quite a tendious, fairly broken experience that will leave you questioning where you went wrong in life that you're playing something worse than the recently released failure that is 'Bonsai'. Hopefully the developer becomes kind enough to throw some bonus colors or backgrounds into the mix, maybe an actual game or mini-game to breathe life into this waste of a dollar but, until then, 'Pointless' is an absolutely "pointless" experience for anyone who's game completion percentage score and achievement count doesn't mean the world to them.","February 22","false","1.0"," 38 of 51 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","38","51","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bilde2910/recommended/442290/","bilde2910","bilde2910","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bilde2910/","13 products in account","I was trying to figure out the point of Pointless yesterday. "Pointless" is literally pointless, which shouldn't come off as a great surprise as the game is called "Pointless". Yet, one could argue that the point of Pointless is to click on points, which means that Pointless isn't pointless after all, firstly because if it has a purpose, it has a point, and because there will always be points on the screen, which the whole point of the game is to click on. That makes Pointless have a point (it's a pointless point, but a point nevertheless), which means that Pointless can be pointless and have a point at the same time. Yet, that'd be a pretty pointless conclusion, because trying to understand the point of that is pointless to the average human being. So the point of the game must be something else.\n\nEither way, here are a few more points about the game:\n\nThe music of "Pointless" is pointless. It's pretty pointy and cool at the start, but once you realize it's just the same tune stuck on repeat, it quickly loses its point and becomes truly pointless and annoying. After pointing and clicking at some 40,000 points on the screen, I had to take off my headset to avoid pointing a pretty pointy weapon at the screen and tearing it apart. Granted, I could go into settings to turn off this pointless music and SFX, but I wasn't sure if I would lose all my pointless progress by doing that, so I just took my headset off instead. (As it turns out, progress *would* have been saved even if I exited, so I don't know why I didn't just do that.)\nThe settings menu is pointless. All you can do is turn on/off the pointless music and SFX, open the credits of the game and switch between a bunch of pointless color palettes. There are no options to change game resolution, or set graphics quality. I'll let that pass for now, though, because having those options for this game would actually have been pretty pointless.\nThe pointless help menu tells me that I can resize the Pointless window, but there's no point in doing that because then the points will be off screen, Resizing the window will make it next to impossible to play the game, because the game's mouse coordination breaks down, so don't do it - there's simply no point in doing it.\nI was going to write some more points about the game here, but the more I write, the more pointless the game becomes. So let me tell you exactly how my pointless gameplay experience was instead.\n\nI downloaded Pointless late at night and decided to play it to see if it would be worth it. That's easily the most pointless decision I have ever made. The game starts off alright, it's a bit hard to hit the points initially, but over time, I got a bit more used to it. I realized that this game has achievements for some pointless reason, and I got more and more interested in the game. After about five minutes, I had clicked on 10,000 points, and that's when this pointless game started going downhill. Nothing happened for a while after that, and I no longer saw the point in playing much longer. So, I opened Steam again and looked for whatever the next pointless achievement would be. Clicking 100,000 points. I was all broken down. It was utterly pointless. Yet, I kept playing for some pointless reason, and after some unknown amount of time, I got some pointless card in my inventory. "Great, the most pointless card I've ever gotten," I thought, figuring I could probably sell it on the Community Market, because I don't want to keep this pointless card in my inventory.\n\nAfter 20 minutes, I started contemplating the meaning of life and the universe, and wondered why I had installed this pointless game in the first place. I would have been better off just leaving it in my library for some pointless reason than to set aside a few pointless megabytes for this game. Either way, I was going to reach that pointless 100,000 achievement at some point, so I kept playing, pointlessly.\n\n40 minutes in, and the point counter was approaching 90,000. Finally, I thought, an end to this pointless game! As I reached 100,000 and got the last pointless achievement, I didn't hesitate to quit the game. Finally, I'm released from the pointless captivity of this pointless game! It was the greatest relief ever. I have officially *survived* Pointless. I should be proud of myself, but I'm not sure what the point of that would be.\n\nTo sum it up, this game is pointless. It does make a good point of killing your mouse, and thanks to this game, I now know what lurks within Room 101 from George Orwell's "1984". The torture chamber is literally playing "Pointless" to 1,000,000 points. No wonder why everyone was so desperate to avoid the pointless room. This game is pointless. There's no point in playing it. Overall rating: 1/10. Would not point my eyes at again.","February 23","false","1.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","7","11","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maskandmirror/recommended/442290/","maskandmirror","Princess Dajve <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maskandmirror/","3915 products in account","My first thought upon launching this game was 'wow, that looks cool!"  The game is designed to look like a gameboy screen, complete with a matching backdrop.  It's a very nice looking game in that regard, but there didn't turn out to be a lot more to it than that, sadly.\n\nThe game itself involves clicking dots, pixels on the screen of the aforementioned gameboy (styled 'gamegal').  The dots disappear quite quickly, but clicking them spawns more dots.  The idea is to keep going without running out of dots.  Power-ups appear at regular intervals, all of which help you by creating lots more dots in different ways.  There are two problems with this; firstly, it is very easy to keep going pretty much indefinitely, because the power-ups spawn just often enough to always save you when you are low on dots.  You'd have to be very unlucky to actually run out.  Secondly, there is no endpoint in sight, save for the steam achievements and unlockable palette swaps.  However, I have only played the game once.  The palettes were all unlocked within a few minutes, and half an hour of relentless and eventually painful clicking, I had all of the achievements too.  I quit the game after hitting 100,000 points, because my hand hurt and there was seemingly nothing more to aim for anyway.\n\nEven as cheap as it is, I can't recommend this one.  I can put it in my 'completed' pile after a single play.  There is no replay value, no real goal, no difficulty curve and it might give you RSI.  Should probably be free.","March 2","false","1.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","7","11","2","0"

The "point" of Pointless is to click the dots to create more dots to earn points and unlock new skins, though there really isn't much point beyond that. Said dots don't have that good of a hit box on them either, and they'll disappear after a short period of time. There are some powerups you can use as well, but they also can easily work to start lagging out the game. In fact, the game starts to lag out fairly easily considering how simplistic it is.\n\nConsidering there are far better free "clicker" games out there, I cannot recommend Pointless at all.

This one did manage to keep me clicking (at least while I wated for cards to drop).  It is also a rare 100% achievement for me so that's nice.
