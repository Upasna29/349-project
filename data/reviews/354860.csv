Who sets out on a journey across a beautiful hand drawn world to put an end to the Florps evil reign. Sounds pretty cool right?\n\nThe core of the game is simple. It is a side scrolling game with simple jump,fight and interaction mechanics.\n\nIt offers a limited customisation aspect with head,weapon and side arm gear. Although it does give you damage stats for different weapons (and there seems to be a few different weapons) so you don't have to stick with one weapon all the way trhough the game. Furthermore head gear also gives you extra stats such as long sprint or more regen from food etc.\n\nIt has a small aspect of survival with a food bar below your health bar. Keeping an eye on these two bars is essential and you need to make sure you have food on you at all times! Or you will suffer. You can even hire a fellow town member for 10 gold pieces to go out and scavenge food for you! So that is always a last resort!\n\nYou can pick up quests from fellow trees who will offer you rewards if you complete them.  At the moment they seem pretty simple. Go out and grab a certain number of the item and bring them back for a reward. Im hoping eventually they may be qeusts to kill certain monsters etc that would be a nice addition if it isn't in the game already. You can even ally with different races to help you in the fight against the enemy!!\n\nThe game also does not tell you where to go, what to do or how to do it. So it is all up to you to figure it out. This could be annoying for some people but that satisfaction when you finally figure out how to accomplish something is a damn good feeling :). It took me ages to figure out at one point how to get to the next mountain area urghhh ha.\n\nHedghogs/spiky frogs are the hardest enemies on the game ha! Do not land on top of them or they will kill you within a few hits! A tree being killed by a hedgehog/frog haha amazing!!\n\nAs is stands it is playable and enjoyable but can be frustrating at times when you have no idea where to go! But hey thats the fun of the adventure right?? trying to figure out what to do! I would definitely recommend this if you like side scrolling games with a nice story, a beautiful hand drawn world, nice and simple fighting mechanics and trying to figure out where and what the hell to do!\n\nHere is a link to a video on my channel where I show you guys some gameplay footage hope you enjoy!!\n\nI also want to add. The developers of this game are awesome! Very helpful, update the game when needed and all round are nice developers!!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/11UprbZzV4k","May 1, 2015","true","9.4"," 43 of 54 people (80%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","80","43","54","8","0"

This is mostly for the developer, but if you're thinking of purchasing this game go ahead and read through my notes. Warning: this will be length, but hopefully helpful.\n\n\nGameplay Notesvery professional-feeling intro\nupgrading stats is cool, I like the design\ni got three-shot by a porcupine 10 minutes into game, this better not be one of those games where the difficulty is ALL over the place. i was too tall to hit him\ni really like how this looks like a much less serious and concrete game from the outside, but it does indeed have basically all the features most RPG's have\nthe Minecraft-styled Furnace is a neat touch\ndialogue is pretty funny\nmy only complaint as of yet is the combat, it's very loose and sometimes (like the porcupine) downright unfair, how do i hit him? he's too damn short (edit: I think I figured it out, he's not killable, just jump over him...)\ni love quests, don't get me wrong, i actually love the grindy ones where you just collect a few things and return, but i feel like i got bombarded with quests immediately, that may overwhelm some players\nday-night cycle was unexpected and very cool\nimmedaitely noticed how the inventory is too small, especially with 10 different collect quests at a time\nit'd be nice if the movement was a bit quicker, seeing as there's lots of backtracking to be done, or maybe if sprint regenerated faster; at this rate i'll be wasting Upgrade Points on speed (edit: upgraded map negates backtracking nicely)\nsome of the quests consist of just waiting and picking the twigs once they respawn, since I'm not strong enough to explore anywhere else\nthe fast travel options make the slow walking speed much more bearable\nthe stat page should pause the game, I'm fine with the map or inventory being open while the game is playing but the stat page should be safe\nwhy don't the boars fight back?\nshould've been a sign pointing left from my house, I thought I could only go right (I may just be stupid, too). once you go left THEN this game gets like twice as good, now that there's a village and tons of merchants right next to my house\nlots of content, tons of items, expected much less. still just wish the combat was better: maybe it would've worked better if it were turn-based instead\ngame progresses extremely slowly; might turn new players away\nchests should have an "auto-deposit" type of feature, where you can just stack all the like items in your inventory onto the corresponding ones in the chest\nNOTE TO NEW PLAYERS: the game starts extremely slow, once it gets going though it's a lot of fun and much more fleshed out than you may have originally thought!\nAesthetic Notesawesome narrator\nbutton clicks are annoying and too loud\naxe sound is weird, especially considering i'm only hitting air. also too loud\nso far, i actually really like the child-like art style\nsome interactable background objects are hard to distinguish from the rest of the background, I find myself spamming E as I walk around to make sure I didn't miss anything\nthe setting and mood of the game is heartwarming; it's lovely\nwhile I adore the art-style, I feel like it causes the gameplay to be more clunky\nTechnical Nptesno 1920x1080 support?\nclicking should be able to be used to interact as well, like click an object to pick it up; since we're given the choice between using UP or LMB to attack, why not let us use the mouse for more?\nBUG: in the first shop you come across, the info box for the Wooden Sword got stuck on my cursor even after i closed the shop, wouldn't go away until I re-opened the shop and hovered over any other item\nBUG: the tooltip box didn't come up for Garlic a couple times while hovering over it\nyou should be able to auto-equip items with RMB\nBUG: "Bottle of Poison" doesn't have an icon, the tooltip box just appears whenever I hover over the empty inventory slot\nmap should close after you've just fast-travelled\nBUG: got another tooltip box stuck on my cursor by opening my inventory while inside a shop\nyou can hurt yourself by throwing a Tomahawk at a wall you're touching?\nweapons should have an actually helpful tooltip, like the fact that once you throw a Tomahawk you have to actually go pick it up, basically rendering it useless in a game with this style of combat\nwhy is W sleep? shouldn't it be interact and not considered a door, and use E instead? guess it doesn't really matter\npeople with completed quests should have some stereotypical way of showing the player; like an exclamation point over their heads; I get so many quests at once I have no idea who asked for what (or they could be waving to get your attention: if you want a cuter way to do it than an ugly exclamation point)\nwhy doesn't my character on the start menu have his equipped items?\nthe auto-save spots should be more emphasized, I'm not sure what saves and what doesn't; all I know is my bed does, but I've also started in the middle of the city once but without the items I got right after leaving it. to my knowledge the center of cities and your bed are the only things that save??\nthe "Hello there! I'm the law around these parts." lady should only say that once, instead of every single time you hit E near her\n\nOverall, this is a pretty solid and very promising game. It's a good experience but I'm worried people may be turned away too early in the game before they get to experience it for real. To fix this major issue I'd just like to see the game start up a bit quicker, explain some things more, and just re-do the combat completely; the combat is seriously my only ACTUAL real problem with this game. It just doesn't work, at least this early in the game. And I'm not saying it's too difficult, I just mean it's ridiculous when you're slowly swinging a hatchet that does 1/10 of the enemy's health, while they're bumrushing you and jumping all over and hitting for like 1/5 of your health every second. It gets a bit frustrating but offers a nice challenge which is good. I hope to see this game improve consistently and I'm looking forward to the complete version! Hope I helped, and have a great day!\n\n","January 2","true","12.8"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","33","38","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brisken/recommended/354860/","Brisken","[Aussie Hero] Bind Brisken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brisken/","76 products in account","My Review for The Adventures of Tree Taking on the role of a formonger named “Tree”, you have to save the island from the evil Florps. There are a number of ways to win, such as to  Defeat the florps leader, make a deal with the florps, join with other species to defeat the florps and many more.\n\nStory 8/10Good Different choices brought more game time and fun\nGood Very fun and clever dialogue make this game enjoyable\nBad The florps are not in the game (Only 1 or 2) until you get to the final parts of the map which was annoying because I wanted to see more\nGraphics 7/10Good The cartoon like graphics showed happiness and joy but it also knows how to make the enemies look evil and dark\nBad Most of the items are poorly drawn and don’t have any straight lines or symmetry. Sometimes I enjoy that simple drawing but I believe it could have been done better\nGameplay 8/10Good The combat was at first very difficult and I had to spend a bit of time trying to hit the enemy without being hit. But after you master this, the combat is very enjoyable and has a good level of difficulty\nGood The weapons and armour had a good variety and each item had different effects to help the player\nBad The quests were basic but many didn’t point me in the right direction and I had to spend quite a lot of time looking around for just one item\nBad The consumable items had a good variety but many of these items (such as poison) had no reason to be in my inventory and there was no quest I could find that wanted that item\nNPCs 7/10Good The enemies attacked mostly in close-up and they run towards you when you are close enough but some do attack with range and some enemies just run away. This made sure I didn’t have to repeat the combat over and over again so I had something different all the time\nGood The friendly NPCs sold items, gave quests or just random chatter. Each NPC looked different so everyone in the game was different\nBad Some NPCs were hard to find for quests and it would have been useful if they all had names so then the quests were easier, although I do enjoy the difficulty.\nMusic/Sound 9/10Good The music in the whole game was so fluid and I loved it completely\nGood The sound effects of fighting and actions in the game were on average because some sound effects didn’t make sense to me but I did not mind it that much\nGood The NPC sound effects were very good and each enemy sounded different so when I couldn’t see the enemy in caves, for example, I could hear the sound of them so I would know what enemy it is\nSettings/Configuration 8/10Good Setting the audio was very easy and there were many options\nGood Setting the graphics was basic and many of the options are already set perfectly for me to play\nBad There was no difficulty setting so I couldn’t make it a harder/better experience for me\nFinal RatingThis game gave me a great experience. I only played for 5 hours and I finished the game twice. There are many more decisions I can make when I replay this. Fortunately, the developer is still making this game better and if he just tweaks this game a bit more, it will be amazing. From what I have played in this game, I’m giving it an 8/10 so I recommend this game to people who want a new experience while playing an RPG\n","April 6","true","5.8"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amaimagi/recommended/354860/","amaimagi","amaimagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amaimagi/","309 products in account","In The Adventures of Tree (TAoT) you play as a Formonger named Tree with a mission to fight the Florps (or not, depending on the choices you made in the game) in the land of Formagetus. Before you head in, there are 3 character slots for you to experiment with under the "Accounts" option in the main menu, each one of them contains an auto-saved character of yours for you to play around with your in-game choices that may or may not affect the ending. As I’ve mentioned, this game doesn’t seem to have a manual save option around, so most of your progress will be auto-saved, which I can’t find myself liking the idea, because that means that if you’ve picked the wrong choice at a point of time, there’s no going back unless you make a different choice with a different character.\n\nRight at the start, the game presents a very standard character creation, nothing too fancy. Once you’ve made your log of Tree, there will be a small window asking if you would like to go through the tutorial. If you’ve missed it, you can always press the in-game hotkey H to bring up “Help” at any time to learn the shortcuts. TAoT doesn’t appear to have a control mapping option available, but the controls aren’t too bad, as it essentially follows the standard WASD and arrow keys to move around. As soon as you’ve been dropped within the realm, there are 3 bars on the top left consists of your general health points, stamina bar and the hunger bar. I’m not quite sure why there’s a need for the hunger bar at all, consider that this game isn’t a survival game that heavily relies on staying hydrated or being healthy, but since it got me to get rid of most of the consumables stocked within my inventory in order to not starve, I guess that will do.\n\nTAoT included some RPG elements within Formagetus and most often than not, you’ll find yourself grinding for materials needed for quests, or simply gathering EXP to level up. The game also offers an unforgiving game world filled with hostile monsters roaming about and has proved to be quite easy to die very early on in the game. On a side note, it is wise to put a good use in the chests located within and outside of your home, because once you’ve died, there’s a chance that you will drop important materials within your inventory. If you want to retrieve your items, you might have to walk back to where you’ve died after fighting off whatever monster that killed you earlier.\n\nIn any case, the game doesn’t have top notched graphics or a complicated battle system with skill tree or whatnot, but it is simply a small gem for you to discover and experience on a Sunday afternoon. I really enjoyed playing this game, waving a hatchet around as a lavender Tree with a creepy smile and I definitely recommend this game for those that are interested in trying it out.","March 29","true","10.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

And straight away, you can select your controls, and customise your tree! You can change the eyes! The mouth! The colour! The voice is awesome! I haven't even started the game and I'm already in love with it.  In fact I'm in danger of exploding with shameless fangirling, which is no good for a person of my age and standing. Nope. Not at all.\n\nThe graphics have their own charm. For me, they are so bad/derpy (I mean cute cough) they are brilliant, and no one should ever change them. Ever.\nAlso, time to eat a hamburger because logic. Never mind you cannibalise trees around you. You're a special sentient tree so it's okay.\n\nAnyway, this game has typical survival features, you need to gather materials, stave off your hunger, collect money to buy upgrades.  You gain money from accepting quests from other trees. You can't really go and accept every quest though because you will lose gold for handing them in late. The combat system pretty much is chop, run, chop. It's limited so that can make it clumsy, it's definitely not a main focus of the game. When you get badly injured though, the blood smears on the sides of the screen are actually a little creepy.\n\nPros\n\nGraphics are hilarious\nYou're a tree\nThe voice acting is pretty cool, so is dialogue\nSo much customisation!\nYou can wear random things and be a christmas tree\nThe way you jump is amazing\nThe sounds/music\n\nCons\n\nCons? What cons?\nOkay maybe one, if you die, you lose all your stuff, and if you walk into another area you can't really get it back.\nSmall inventory aswell since not everything stacks up (twigs only stack to 5)\nTL;DR\n\nOverall Verdict\nDefinitely get this game! It's awesome. That's all you need to know.\n\nIf you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group!","November 18, 2015","true","9.4"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","15","21","5","0"

Great for people that might want to allow another member of their house to play the same game and have their own game save slot.\n\nYou start off getting to customize your character tree with all kinds of options to make yourself look unique and interesting.  Then you are brought into a huge 2D world with nice hand drawn art and other people and creatures.  Moving your tree avatar to the left or right side of the screen will load in the next screen and if you move with a door just behind you, you can move up (W key) to move through the door as long as it is unlocked.  Items can be accessed and NPCs can be talked to by hitting your E key by default when you move near them.  Attacking a baddie can be done by simply clicking your left mouse button.  Space jumps, and shift allows you to sprint but uses your stamina which will recover over time when you stop sprinting.  Note that all of these keys CAN be customized in the options to what ever you prefer.\n\nI gave this game a 74% out of 100, with most of the points knocked off only because the game I feel is just a little over-priced at it's regular $9.99 USD price tag.  Still, a good score though if you are looking for a casual RPG or perhaps one that might interest and engage children.\n\nRecommended for sure unless you are expecting Skyrim or Dark Souls for your money here.  :-)","May 1","true","1.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Your world, an island, is invaded by evil Florps – purple furry creatures and it's up to you to save your people ...um or fellow trees I guess? I play the game for almost 7 h and this is my first impressions.\n\nFor a 2D game it have a lot of settings. In the graphics section there are Resolution, Subtitles, Motion Blur, V-sync, Fullscreen and Depth of Field. The game runs smoothly with 60 FPS and you can even play it on Windows XP. Audio options are plenty. There six different sliders – ambient, movie, mob, GUI, music and others. Excelent work! There is full controller support and you can rebind the keys, even for the controller. I didn't try how is the gameplay with him, but I think it's the preferable to play with a controller. Keyboard and mouse work just fine.\n\nI'm not a big fan of the graphic style. It's hand drawn and cute, but I didn't like that much the character models and the world. This is highly subjective and didn't put me off. I really enjoy the game, despite not liking the graphic style that much. The world is vibrant and colorful (and dangerous), even the evil Florps are also kinda cute. Consider this: my favourite game of all time is Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth and the graphics there are bad.\n\nI started the review with the story, so now gameplay is next. As a mentioned it's side scroller action adventure with a big world to explore. You start by creating your character. Then you are free to roam the island, but be careful. You may reach dangerous places before you are strong enough to deal the enemies there and you will die. Then after you respawn you have to go to the place you die to collect your stuff. The first thing you have to know is you have three bars in the top left corner – health, hunger and stamina. So you have to manage them. Food is actually easy to acquire. Around the world there are a lot of fruits and vegetables to eat, but meat is preferable. There are creatures like birds and boars to kill and get raw meat from them. Since it's raw you have to cook it. The food from one type is stacking, so it's doesn't take much space in your invetory. I heavily advise to supply yourself with a lot of meat, because with food not only you replenish your hunger meter, but also your health. Later I found that there are potions.\n\nSo this management part is not the only thing you can do. You will fight and do quests. Most of jobs you take are just fetch qustes. But the will lead you to new places and you will have to kill creatures for food or to progress. The fighting is okay. You stabing or you swinging. I know that you can buy bow, but I don't have it yet. So beside him there are a lot of different swords, axes and others weapons with different stats. By doing quests and selling thing, you will get money In almost every villige you have a vendor that sells weapons, shields, glasses, pipes, cigarettes, hats, lanters for light and so on. Everything have some benefit for you like lower hunger or higher jump, so it wise to not sell everything, you never know where your quest will lead you. For example. There is a quest where i had to go high in the mountain, but it's freezing. So you have to find something to keep me warm, because you are constantly loosing life. It's a hat. You don't have the inventory space to carry around everything. You will store your stuff in chests around the island. You can buy more things than those that I mentioned to ease your journey, but you have to see the for yourself.\n\nThere is also light RPG system here. When you level up, you get upgrade points to put in 10 different stats. Creatures respawn, so you will fight and gain xp constantly.\n\nEnemies you encounter are very diverce. Spiders, bees, ice hedghogs, slimes and so on. Almsot everyone of them will drop something that you can sell or you need it ot complete a quest. In the description in Steam it's written that it have 50 different creatures and i think i saw until now around the half of them. Also i fought two bosses so far. The first was not too difficult, but the second, a rock monster, killed my a couple of times. They were fun to fight.\n\nThe world is big and every place you visit is different. You will go to different villiges, caves, climb a mountain, go through a swamp and so on. There you will see a lot of trees, from which you will get quests. The great thing about the world is that's full of secrets and there is no hand holding. You will see places that can be access only by having some equipmet or something else and you have figure it out what you need. Exploration is required, because you can find stuff you normaly have to pay or expensive things to sell. There are also things you can do that can lead to some strange consequences. Take the money from mill, trust me. There is also fast travel and thank God for that. You have a map and by opening it you can travel to the places you discovered. My advice is to buy a bigger map as soon as posible. It will save you a lot of walking. I don't know if there some consequences, but every night i go to my house and sleep. You can travel while it's night, but if sleeping is implemented here, it must be for some reason.\n\nThe sound design is okay. Fx are good, but the music is ... i can't remember a single track. It's there is, fit the fun setting, but it's nothing special. However there is one track that stand out a little bit. When you see a girl with a guitar pay her 20 coins. That is all i'm going to say.\n\nI have one big problem with the game and it's the inventory. When you need to eat, you have to open it, then to click on something and the game doesn't stops. Imagine that when you fight a boss. That is why the rock monster kill at least 7-8 times, because i couldn't heal my self in time. If there is a key just for the food to heal you fast, it would be awesome. Through my time with the game i have encounter few small bugs and one big. The game froze and i have to close it from the task manager. This was just once and the game was still in EA. Also one or two times the game didn't register my hits at all, so i had to restart the game. After it's full release i didn't encounter any of those bugs again.\n\nThe game came out of EA on first of March  and it's good to see that it's not abandoned and unfinished. Despite not likeing that much the art style and the rather simplistic combat, i really enjoy the game. It's fun, colorful, offers hours of gameplay, doesn't hold your hand, have a big world explore, secrets to be discovered and it suppose to have different endings based on your choices throughout the game. I recommend it.","March 13","true","8.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

AND: You can finish the game in different ways! Which brings me to the next good point: It's really fun to gain all the achievements. Some are very easy, some are quite tricky - but after all it's nothing like: Play 1,000,000 hours...\n\nThe price is fair, because: I bought it a month after the release and (apart from the fact that the game was already really fun to play back then) the devs did and still do great work.

Now for the negatives;\n\n1. The loading screens- For a pretty simple game I have no idea why it takes to fricken long to load. Not only that but the game freezes for simple stuff like opening your inventory. Seriously, why is this a problem?\n\n2. Combat- Combat is just downright terrible. Which sucks because it plays a pretty big role in the game.

There are still some bugs that need to be fixed. It isn't the easiest to upgrade your character so that he's stronger amongst the beasts you encounter. There are a variety of different characters in this, which is good (even though they all look the same :p) The quests are all fairly basic, although some are more difficult than others to complete due to the game still being in development. It's a basic game but easy to play, which was what I was looking for in a game.","September 18, 2015","false","5.0"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","5","15","0","3"

It is more polished now and also I think that graphics are a bit better than half a year ago.\n\nThis is a 2d adventure game where you play as some kind of living tree that goes here and there and explores. There is a levelling system where you have some stats and you can assign points to have more hp or better attack.\n\nI think that the whole point of this game is to make quests and explore the world. The quest are simple - bring 5 carrots, bring 3 apples, so on. For completing quests you gain gold and probably XP.\n\nCombat system is now better than in the previous version as actually you can hit enemies without being overwhelmed by their damage.\n\nAll in all the game gets much better with every patch. What is very positive about this game is that developers actually take care in what people are saying about their product and try to implement changes based on feedback into the game.\n\nIf you like 2d platformers with some basic quests and basic combat system then you can try this game. I can see that this is a basic game that is playable, but this is just not my cup of tea.\n\n----------\nFor anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/","November 4, 2015","false","0.7"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","35","7","20","4","11"

You get to play as a tree set out on an adventure to save the world. The art is fantastic and the gameplay is very fun. There are over 30+ items that can be worn and held allowing for a lot of unique character looks! The game does contain a few small bugs, but the devs usually fix them quickly.","May 3, 2015","true","90.4"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","6","18","3","0"
