There's nothing so intense or vulgar as blood or guts on display here; the mood is held together by tales of disappearing villages, phantom deer and monsters that lurk in the lake and is far more of an exploratory experience than it is a QTE masher.\nVery promising indeed.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7g7sCf4t0","September 15, 2015","true","1.0"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","78","31","40","11","0"

The other one was your typical, generic, steaming-pile-of-dog-turd whipped up overnight by some enterprising (read: cynical and money-driven) fourteen year-old (its name is "BlackShadows", in case you have a few bucks you don't have the heart to simply flush straight down the toilet).  The other one...was this.  Suffice it to say, this one won.  By a looooooooong margin...\n\nTo say that this (still very) Early Access game shows "potential" would be as self-evident as saying that Michael Bay needs to be drawn-and-quartered in a public square (before posting said footage all over YouTube-land as evidence of what we civilised folk do to people who can't even make GIANT ♥♥♥♥ING ROBOT movies remotely exciting).  Already, this game has more to offer than the vast majority of other "horror" games released onto Steam since, well...since basically all this Greenlight and Early Access nonsense started up, to be honest.\n\nRest assured, for once, this ISN'T just some "small development team" (read: one dude in his bedroom) who's whipped up a quick trailer and some semi-snazzy screenshots to dupe the idiot consumer (read: me) into giving them money for something which they put together in one afternoon (and maybe a tiny bit of the evening).  Nosirree.  The attention to detail in this game will make your JAW DROP.  Why are there small rocks falling on me from above?  Look up...holy ♥♥♥♥, there's a skinny, creepy-♥♥♥♥♥ black figure with red eyes running over a stone bridge above me!  Wonder what happens if I wade any further into this lake?  Holy old Jesus, I'm actually SWIMMING, in first-person no less, and what the...I've just been eaten by a GIANT FISH!!  And all this in just my first hour of casually wandering about and wondering exactly what I'm doing, but honestly, it's all so splendidly atmospheric and immersive that I frankly don't GIVE a damn!!!\n\nIf only all Early Access games were this promising.  It's obviously hard to give it a very definitive verdict yet, not least of all because disaster could still strike and the entire production team might all spontaneously combust, but at least we know these guys are in it for the RIGHT reasons.  Trust me, you only need play this for ten or twenty minutes to work THAT much out.  Oh, and for those of you out there who like comparisons? The games this reminds me of the most, thus far, are Among the Sleep and Kholat, with a hearty dose of fairytale-esque shenanigans added to the pot.  This is definitely shaping up to be one of THE horror games of 2015.  Or...2016, or whenever it gets finished.  One game which might actually be worth the trouble of holding your breath over.\n\nVerdict: 9/10.","September 12, 2015","true","1.0"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","81","21","26","8","2"

Devs have plans to release the second section within the month of November, and the third section shortly after.\n\nThe game features a dark and gloomy atmosphere, which adds to the eerie affect of being lost in the forest looking for clues to this mystery. Exploration is key in this game, where you must look around for clues and hints as to find out what's happening behind these dark trees, and what danger will lie ahead.\n\nIf you have any skeptisism, try the free version first, and if you would like to support the developers to make this more updated version and try it out yourself, purchase this by all means.","November 1, 2015","true","17.5"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

Decent atmosphere & setting; don't quite understand why I'm collecting random bones but benefit of the doubt that I will understand that in the full game & at least it isn't keys to unlock doors.\nAlso, for a game whose save menu seems to be written in a language that isn't english, the notes are remarkably well written with only mispelling Altar in the note about Altars, it gets written as alter but way better than english than some of the other indie horror titles.\n\nI get the feeling it will end up as more walking simulator than horror & I probably will be essentially collecting keys by some other name, but I'm okay with that if the setting & story are good enough & this looks promising.","September 11, 2015","true","0.8"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","17","21","2","0"

Just when I had given up hope there would be any more cool horror games like Amnesia, Phantasmal, Kholat, and Penumbra, this gem appeared. The graphics are sublime, the story, (so far), engaging and keeps ones attention. It is not a typical horror game either. It is complex and well thought out. It doesn't lower itself to overdone typical enemies like serial killers with big knives, but rather this game plays on deep instinctual fears of being alone and essentially lost in the woods, lacing together things like abandoned dwellings, old magic,  wild animals, lake monsters, a good dose of supernaturalism, and more. I cannot say enough about this game. If you dig an intense atmosphere and horror that thinks and bites, this game is for you.  10/10 For story, graphics, overall playing and controls. A+!   I hope to see more from this developer~ Sarah","September 16, 2015","true","38.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/recommended/345430/","LadyTenjoin","LadyTenjoin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/","983 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Cursed Forest is an adventure horror game that I’ve been following for quite some time now. There’s a free but old version of the game and I had a great time with it. From what I can tell, the developers are expanding on the story of the Steam Early access version of the game and I’m glad because in the free version, the story was almost nonexistent.\n\nJust a warning, the Early Access version is about 30 minutes long, give or take the amount of time you spend on exploring. Only a small area of the forest is currently available. (how many times did I write version there)\n\nThe story is about this man, he receives a message that his mother was sent to the hospital so of course, as the world’s most caring son, he rushes to her, only to find himself in a car accident. Now, he’s trapped in this eerie forest (btw, this isn’t told in-game, at least, not to my knowledge. I read it from the steam page.) Through notes scattered all around the woods, it is revealed that there is some kind of entity killing off stranglers and travelers that roam the forest.\n\nThe game’s sounds are spot on so wearing decent headphones is recommended. From the faint footsteps of our “stalker,” to the hushed whispers of the forests, I was freaking myself out, even when nothing is happening. In the beginning parts, the entity seems to be observing us, as if it’s gauging our reaction. I do remember in the free version, the entity becomes more aggressive later so that’s something to look forward to. So far, the game isn’t scary, however, it is unnerving. You get that sense that you’re being watched, before we are even aware of our “friend.” So, the scare factor of the game, on a scale of 1-10, (1 being, “me looking for something to scare me but couldn’t find it, no matter how hard I tried” and 10 being, “I ♥♥♥♥ my pants, I should’ve worn a diaper.” I rate The Cursed Forest a 6/10 (6 being, “Well, well. We’re getting there. What else ya got?”) Sorry, my rating is strange. I’m making it up as I go.\n\nFor the gameplay mechanics, there aren’t any puzzles (for now) but there are bones that need to be collected. It isn’t fully explained why our character is suddenly gathering 8 pieces of human remains but I just go with the flow, hoping that it will be touched upon later on. All I can do is wait and see. (If there is an explanation in game, please let me know. I’ll pay in cookies)\n\nIn the graphics side, the game is beautiful. Even in the free version, I was impressed with the details of the forest. I’m not surprised that it’s carried over to the Steam version. I haven’t had any problems, in terms of framerate drops, crashes, or bugs, but I’ve read in the forums that there are people struggling to maintain playable framerate. It is on the CryEngine but I’m reading even on decent hardware, players are having issues. (My Specs are GTX 970, i7-4790S, 12 GB of ram, so on and so forth.) Be aware of that.\n\nThe game is constantly being patched so there’s involvement from the developer(s) and that’s good to see. I recommend it for now. I will update my review as the game updates. As with most Early Access games, The Cursed Forest isn’t finished so if you’re planning on buying it, just know that. Try out the free version first if you’re on the fence. You’ll get a sense of how the EA version will be.\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros:\n- Great, unsettling atmosphere\n- Beautiful Graphics\n- Great Sounds (wear headphones!)\n\nCons:\n- Story is unclear (for now)\n- Not sure why our character is collecting bones\n- Optimization problems (reports on the forums)\n- Current version only showcases about 30 minutes or so of gameplay\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nWhen you have the time, watch me fool around in The Cursed Forest. Have a nice day!\n\nThe Cursed Forest Video","September 18, 2015","true","6.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","3"

I tend to see the sights, explore every cave and look behing every tree and rock. But as far as I understood, this was only a section of game and there's more in the actual release version.\n\nThe game won't tell you much about how you got into the Cursed Forest or lead you towards any waypoints, which I think is a good thing. I like how I can draw my own conclusions and try to fit the pieces of puzzle myself. Occasionally you may find torn journal pages with some information but there are also subtle hints scattered around in the forest - I'll let you find those yourself.\n\nGameplay feels really smooth, the visuals are stunning and even the audio side feels really good. The sounds of the forests, crows, crickets and wind combined with the atmospheric tunes, some occasional music... I really just gave in and let the game suck me right inside it's world.\n\nAs the game is still in Early Access and much of it's content is missing, it still gave me a really good experience. There were some nice spooky moments and in no point it felt like I'm playing a game full of horror/thriller clichés.\n\nThe tension in the game builds up slowly and you get a feeling that someone's watching you, or something is just about to happen if you blink your eyes now. From what I saw in the current build, it's not a gore massacre horror game. More like a mystical, bit scary adventure that can really suck you in if you let it happen. (turn on the headphones, mute your wife and phone and lock the man cave's door)\n\nNow I just wish I could play some more.","September 18, 2015","true","3.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Ahem...NOT REAL GAMERS!\n\nI'm a fan of horror games and I liked this game when I played the original free version.  I was so excited when I found out a remake was releasing on Steam.  So far, I'm impressed!  Yes the game is a little buggy because it's in early access and still being worked on.  The bugs I've encountered aren't game breakers.\n\nFor a horror game this is an excellent game.  Not long into the forest and I was already getting nervous!  There's so much detail in the forest.  The environment, ambience, sounds...it's so creepy!  This game is also a HUGE improvement from the original.  More game settings, has save points, graphical improvements, etc.  The graphics are great but I've noticed they take a minute to fully load and the devs are aware of this.  Some people may have issues playing it but I know from playing this that it'll soon be an A+ horror game.  Give them time.\n\nPros\nExcellent horror game.\nEnvironment.\nGame settings.\nSave points.\nDevelopers are actively working on the game and communicating with gamers.\n\nCons\n(These are due to the game still being programmed.)\nIt's buggy...duh.\nGame takes a while to load.\nTextures take a while to fully load at start of game.\nThe notes you find in the game are plain text and don't look like they're written on paper.","September 12, 2015","true","2.2"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","20","29","2","0"

A step in the right direction in my opinion, as not only do I wish to experience the correct path in the game, but also experience each of the wrong paths as well in order to see everything this game has to offer for scares and creepies.\n\nNow for the technical side.\n\nI have NOT experienced a single issue with saving, loading, or any of the gameplay in general. No errors, no crashes and no unexpected shutdowns. For an Early Access Game, I cannot express properly how well done this first release is. The only errors/issues I may have experienced  are already known. Muddy textures that correct themselves after a few seconds when you first start up the game and a few spelling errors in some of the notes (Alters which are supposed to be Altars).  Minor issues all in all.\n\nFor all the bad reviews that have been put on this game, I must admit, in my own experience with the game, most if not all of them are false.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who's interested in an immersive and unique fear experience and those who understand that this IS an Early Access Game.\n\nPROS:\n-Immersive Experience\n-Gorgeous Graphics\n-Unique Effects\n-Not your traditional jumpscare filled horror game\n\nCONS:\n-Minor loading issues that are already known about\n-The landscape is so well done it is very easy to miss a path (Not a major con, just means you have to pay closer attention!)\n-Would LOVE to have a way to mark which paths I've been on.

Story is that, you are received message what write your mother now in hospital, so you decided you must go to your mother so fast how you can. Because this reason, you decided use the shortest road, which is very old. For your bad luck you something jumped in front of car and you to avoid a crash, turned to off-road and crashed somewhere deep in forest. This forests dark, full with mystic and maybe dangerous. You got a chance to explore this forest and solve all mysteries.\n\nWhile you play a game you can fell a very good horror atmosphere, its atmosphere is created with a dark forest and good sound support. When you walk you found in some places thing what you should pick up and the notes what contain a strange stories about a forest. In all time you fell that someone watching you and follow all your steps. The graphic style is also good, fully harmonic with a horror style. Control system also good, enough easy, so this shouldn’t do any problem while you play.\nSo my verdict\n\n+good horror atmosphere\n+scary moments\n+steam things(steam achievements, trading cards)\n+CryEngine\n+interesting stories about that what happened in a forest\n+good sounds\n\n-early access (so because this now only one chapter can you play)\n-some bugs (but after EA this also been solved I think)\n\n\nSo i think its good horror adventure game what a bit looks like a walking simulator.  Game have a very good atmosphere and sounds, but graphic also not bad. And don’t forget, about notes what you find in forest, they have a very interesting stories. So if you like horror games, or you like for example Amnesia, Penumbra and other same game, its game for you. Even this game is now in Early Access this absolute worth this price, because it’s can be only better than now when get all chapters and been finally released.

Minor bug I am sure they will fix, they know about it.\n\nThe forest is fantastic, the foliage moves as you brush through it, the fire and water are astonishingly real looking. The lighting is wonderful, you feel like you are in a real forest you can almost smell the rotting wood and fallen leaves. It doesn't crunch under your feet, it scuffs and squealches as you trod along muddy tracks. Small pebbles scatter, wooden bridges creak and and crack. Yes there are some minor glitches but the realism is quite incredible, it is perfectly drawn.\n\nNow for the scares, birds flap out of bins and woodpiles, things fall off shelves, broomsticks fall over with a clatter. Bird callsand deer come from hidden parts of the wood roaring and scattering mud as they run across your path. Leaves fall and softly settle on the ground, they hit a bush then slide off to land on the floor or in the water, Autumn/Fall is upon us it seems and the daylight seems watery with the dim prospects of Winter just weeks away.\n\nI won't mention the scarecrow...damn I just did...\n\nSave points are found as altars, not only are they save points but I seem to be collecting them as well, at least I have a count of how many I've found so far. Similarly I've found two sets of human bones and seem to be collecting those as well, though I have no idea why. There are notes left along the way to read, they recount the lives of people that once lived nearby, nobody around now though except the follower, the dark shadow you see on the trailer scampering around. He has crossed my path twice now and seems harmless enough...I'll let you know if/when he kills me and eats me though.\n\nYes this is part one of four, yes it is early access and yes, so far not a lot has happened but I've only been at it an hour but come see for yourself, this is so beautifully done, they could have photographed every inch of a real living forest and copied it, it really is that good.","September 22, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Loved the IndieDB version and now that they are polishing and expanding it I'll be going on a second honeymoon. If you have any interest at all (which if you enjoy horror, you should), check out the version on IndieDB, it will give you a good idea of the gameplay and things to expect (though not as polished).","February 18","true","0.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The attention to detail of this forrest is unbelievable. The forrest looks so beautiful. The atmosphere is creepy. The imersion in this game is unbelievable just don't look down, those rubber leg will break that imersion. For early access this game is unbelievably stable runs smooth on my end anyway. With so many poorly made horror games infesting steam right now (that are not in early access) i'm looking at you sylvio. It nice to see a early access title finally shines brighter, through the black hole that is the horror genre on steam.\n\nP.S LOOK AT THE PRICE IT ♥♥♥♥ING CHEAP!!!!","May 5","true","2.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Я играл в оригинальный cursed forest, и скажу что то была одна из лучших инди игр. Но это... Это даже не игра, и даже не демо. Тут все время вы будете просто бегать вокруг, пытаясь найти дорогу, и ничего больше.
