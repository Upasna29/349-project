"http://steamcommunity.com/id/marrowsky/recommended/236090/","marrowsky","[PMXLB] Marrowsky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/marrowsky/","151 products in account","Chris Sawyer, sole developer of RollerCoaster Tycoon, once said that "many game designs suffer from having too many people working on them, losing their individual character and becoming games that look and play like so many others." Dust: An Elysian Tail's animator-turned-developer, Dean Dodrill, programmed, animated for, planned out, and otherwise developed this game on entirely his own effort, save for a few sound people and a smattering of voice actors. He has nothing to offer you but his blood, toil, tears and sweat; times when he would have to cram ten months' work into three, times when his Christian beliefs were put to the ultimate test, even times when by some sheer luck or divine intervention, the solution to an impossible problem of development would come to him in a dream. And when the fruit of his labour came to see the light of day, it became a perfect example of the kind of game Chris Sawyer was talking about. A game that one man was sure he wanted to create, with his will, intention and vision left unspoiled in the final product by the opinions of the many others who would be working on it otherwise; a work of art with his personal signature left in every facet of it.\n\nDust: An Elysian Tail captures the aesthetic of an animated movie almost perfectly, with just a few mature touches to keep its older audiences interested. Its characters, plot and background lore may not be the most complex, Shakespearian thing you've ever encountered, but if anything, they will charm you. In fact, I would compare the story more so to an ancient myth or tale of legend. Despite its animations only being about 12-24 FPS, which is pretty standard for animated works, it runs at a smooth, 60 FPS, and is uber-responsive to controls as well, so that it still plays fluidly with controller or keyboard. Especially considering the majestic hand-painted backgrounds and stages, as well as even the slightest shader effects, like light refracting around icicles, and bloom/lens flare effects that make their presence known, but don't overstay their welcome, I would call this, to my knowledge, the best-looking 2D game we've seen yet.\n\nThough the aesthetic of the game may grow to be your neo-childhood, the gameplay mechanics are fuelled on pure testosterone. Being the closest thing that I know of to a fantasy-action-exploitation-film-turned-beat-'em-up-Metroidvania, it carries an emphasis on stylish swordplay, massive combos, and looking like a total bad-♥♥♥ in the heat of battle, as well as some RPG-like mechanics, like stat levelling and equippable items, that you'll pay more attention to in the quieter moments, to add some complexity and sense of progress. In fact, you may find yourself caught up in an inner struggle over whether to raise the difficulty to add more challenge, or keep it the same to retain the feeling of being all-powerful. As is standard with Metroidvania-type games, there are hidden areas that can be accessed as you gain new skills, and great attention was put into making these areas still enjoyable to look for, and not just like a long, tacked-on extra journey.\n\nAs was mentioned before, the plot isn't exactly the most complex thing out there. In a game like this, it actually works out for the better. It was a refreshing change to play a game that seemed so innocent and honest with itself. Even the protagonist, Dust, starts out innocent - he follows the trope of the amnesiac hero, having just come to in a forest with barely a memory of his past self. There's plenty of baddies to slice and dice your way through, sure, but Dust: AET is really just a journey of self-discovery that, as you play through and the pieces come together, slowly morphs into something truly epic. It gives you a rush unlike any other to fight your way through the final level, and to get to the final boss and pulverize him multiple times, even until the very end of the game, made me the most satisfied I'd felt with any game in quite a while.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is criminally underrated. No review, including mine or any other, will completely do this game justice. You have to buy it to fully understand just how Dodrill's inhumanly hard work all paid off to create the best experience I've received from a video game in a long time - and you will, too.\n\nAnd for those who get tremendously upset over the fact that this game contains anthropomorphic animals, who cares? Playing this game won't turn you into a flamboyant, hyper-sexual sparkledog of a furry. It is something that almost everyone can enjoy, as long as you remove any prejudices about this game from your mind. Unfortunately, that seems to be the main thing holding people back from playing it.","January 11, 2015","true","19.5"," 295 of 322 people (92%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","92","295","322","18","10"

It's not just a simple platform/slasher game with a pinch of RPG. This game gives you what AAA games don't, when you play it, it stays in your mind and your heart for a long time, you just can't stop thinking about main characters and their quest until you turn this game on again. Then, after 15-20 hours of playing which is a very long time for an indie game, the end comes leaving us with emptiness and one thought in mind... why it had to end so "quickly"?\n\nBut that's enough of my jabbering, lets talk about the structure of this game.\n\nThe playthrough gives you a lot of pleasure, both of fighting hundreds of enemies and of finding well-hidden secrets or collecting your "friends". You can reach some of them only before the final bossfight, which is a great opportunity to backtrack a little and find out what we missed during our journey. Exploring the world isn't something that the game force you to do so, you just want to do it yourself. Why? Because the environment is just marvelous.\n\nA hand-made graphics and backgrounds are one of the biggest advantages of this production because it looks like a fairy tale that you can live in. You can explore it and admire such a fantastic and well-planned world. Every single location has its own charm and atmospfere without any unneccessary elements that could distruct us. Literally, every little piece of it is in the right place.\n\nOf course this game has some flaws and bugs but it just doesn't matter when you're experiencing such a wonderful adventure.\n\nAnd lets say something about it. You can't say a bad word about the main plot, if that was a movie, the author would definitely receive an oscar for it. The enjoyable mixture of both main and side quests gives you a wide range of every known and unknown feelings human ever had. I'd like to say it that way... from happines to sadness with sorrow and anger along the way in only 10 seconds.\n\nLet me say something about soundtrack too. Maybe while beating opponents to death, it's hard to pay attention to music playing in the background but when we stop slaughtering everything around, it's nice to hold on for a second, watch the view and listen to those wonderful tracks. This music is magic and it fits perfectly but listening to it without playing Dust is as much pleasurable. Ideal for a quiet, alone night with a cup of tea...\n\nAnd at the end... what about the fighting system? At the beginning you might think that simple sword-swinging combined with jumping isn't going to drag your interest for a long, even if it looks astonishing, but during the game we can find various of unique moves and techniques that can provide new ways of making incredible hit-combos up to 1000 hits!\n\nThere's much more I would like to say about this game but no amount of simple words can express the way I feel after playing this, for me prefect at any aspect, game. I hope my review will give you a proper answer to the question: "Is this game's worth playing?"\n\nAnd one last thing, you may think that 15 euro for this game is a little to much and you may be right, you can just buy it in a bundle or wait for a discount but... this game is worth much more... 15 euro is nothing for such an experience like this that not many games can give you, really, honestly.\n\nThanks for your time and have fun, you'll have it, that's for sure.\n(and sorry for possible mistakes in this text)","November 5, 2014","true","36.6"," 188 of 199 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","188","199","3","8"

It plays as an exploratory 2D-sidescroller / action-platformer— a genre colloquially dubbed “metroidvania.”  Captivating, hand-painted artwork and a stellar soundscape merge with solid gameplay mechanics and a trope-riddled, but well-told, narrative to form the end result of a pretty enjoyable game experience.  Be aware: this game was designed to be kid-friendly, and does have an overall essence similar to what you may find on children’s Saturday morning cartoons.\n\nThe gameplay essentially boils down to 2D hack-and-slash combat and mild exploration.  The combat is fast paced, fluid, responsive, and quite fun at first.  But, to be honest, it does grow stale as the game goes on.  You have the same attack abilities by the end of the prologue that you have at the end of the game— and it isn’t that many.  You will quickly see the best strategy is to just spam a few buttons while hopping around, and that’s basically what the combat becomes.  The various difficulties spread the gamut from “for children” to “for masochists,” with some sweet spots in between.  Although, even on “Hardcore,” with some grinding you can raise your stats to a point where it becomes easy… if you have the patience.\n\nFurthermore, there are a lot of secrets to discover and treasures to find throughout all the levels, which to me was more exciting than the combat.  You will unlock new movement abilities as the game progresses, which allows you to reach new treasures in all the levels.  This also was slightly annoying because often times throughout the game you will spot a treasure that is tantalizing you just beyond your reach; but it then becomes that much more satisfying when you return later to collect it with your shiny, new double jump ability.\n\nThe story is overloaded with tropes and clichés.  Right from the start: you are greeted with a main character with heroes amnesia, but a great power within; you are greeted with a cute-but-ditsy, comic-relief sidekick; and you are greeted with another sidekick who knows your destiny, but won’t just come out and say it… just to name a few.  From there, the story does develop into something more substantial and decently interesting, yet still quite cliché.  Also, as I alluded to earlier, the game has an overall identity akin to what you find in children’s cartoons.  And the characters and voice acting do not stray from this identity.  Thus, some of you may find some of the dialogue and acting to be annoying or childlike.  Although, personally, I thought the voice acting was pretty well done and enjoyed most of the scenes— but I am easily amused, and am unquestionably a child-at-heart.\n\nDust: An Elysian Tail is definitely a good game.  There are a lot of great elements at work making it a true gem.  It does get a little stale towards the end of the game if you are returning to previous areas to 100% it, but if you just play through the game and don’t bother with that stuff then you will probably finish before it goes flat.  I highly recommend it to any fan of the genre and would say it is a safe bet for the average all-around gamer.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","August 12, 2015","true","16.5"," 188 of 206 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","188","206","6","2"

Most of the work was done just by one person, Dean Dodrill, who was an artist, animator, screenwriter, producer etc. Development lasted 7 years and it seemed that Elysian Tail will never be finished. And may be so would be if Dean Dodrill had not decided to turn his project into the game.\n\nTOTAL RECALL\n\nThe protagonist (Named Dust) wakes up in the woods and doesn't remember anything about his past. Immediately he meets new friends who will be with him all the way. Wise and calm speaking Blade of Ahrah and the keeper of this sword, a charming flying little creature (Nimbat) named Fidget. By the end of the game, we'll know who is actually Dust and what hides his past.\n\nELYSIAN TALE\n\nFrom 2D game with cartoon furry characters i didn't expect epic or exciting stories. But in fact, everything is different. The story begins with a fairly quiet atmosphere of a small adventure, but ends by epic confrontation between the two armies fighting for their cause. And the personal story of the protagonist is intriguing to the end of the story. I can’t don't say special thanks to the awesome work of actors. I want to underline a terrific job of actors and artist. With their help, the game fascinates and keeps interest until the end.\n\nDUST IN ACTION\n\nDust: An Elysian Tail is 2D beat ‘em up action RPG. Combat system uses 4 buttons with which you can perform various combos. In the game is not very many kinds of enemies, but their combinations create a variety of interesting situations, making fights interesting enough. Boss battles can be quite difficult, but still interesting.\n\nDUST TO DUST\n\nQuite unexpectedly (at least to me) the game was not just entertainment for few evenings, but very exciting story with charming characters and interesting gameplay. Watching the final credits, i had only the pleasant sensations. Wants to be back to this enchanting world to see more adventurous of the Dust and Fidget.\n\nSpecial attention is worthy of the music written by the composer HyperDuck SoundWorks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/236090/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","Dust is an impressive game considering it was made by a single person.  It's not only longer than most games (especially at this price range,) but more polished as well.  While the game does have some rough edges, it remains very high quality overall, much more so than many games produced by larger teams.\n\nThe game is made in classic metroidvania style with maps made from sizable rooms and areas you can return to later for secrets once you have obtained new abilities.  While the game is split up into a number of different maps, fast travel is very limited, only allowing up to 2 entrance points for most maps.  This makes backtracking rather tedious, though you can buy an item from the shop that lets you exit the current map from any save point to get out faster.  It's worth going back and searching for all the easter egg characters though.\n\nDust features some fantastic art and while I'm not really a fan of the anime-style characters, they are very well-made.  The larger-sized characters shown in dialogues are obviously low resolution though for some reason which makes them stand out from the rest of the game.  The game world and the different graphical effects for combat abilities are just as well done, some of the best I've ever seen even.\n\nThe story is also very well-written with a good variety of characters and excellent voice acting.  It's not just another cliche "save the girl" story which is a nice change of pace.  I don't quite understand why every character seems to have a different accent while living in the same village though.\n\nThe combat system is where the one-man development team shows its weakness however.  While the combat looks and feels good, the controls aren't terribly responsive.  Executing combos requires you to press the attack buttons much faster than the animations play so I frequently found myself attacking several times after defeating a group of enemies due to queued up actions.  The main problem though is that the combat is just too easy.  Dust feels like a god, able to stunlock the majority of enemies in large groups with basic attacks and block almost any attack, even from bosses, though blocking it's pretty unnecessary for most of the time.  The game tries to compensate for this by making enemies hit very hard, which is a poor design choice shared by most modern games.  In addition, airborne attacks will lock on and dash towards any nearby targets so it's not really necessary to aim and you also have a very powerful airborne spinning attack which helps you dodge attacks as well as doing heavy damage.\n\nThe combat system starts to show more balanced and challenging combat near the end of the game when enemies start using more varied attacks and dodge your attacks more.  Unfortunately by this time you will have obtained snowballing gear and a full-screen stun attack which when combined, makes quick work of any enemies short of the last level.  The only actual challenging part is the final boss fight which makes for a very sudden change from the rest of the game.\n\nThe other big weakness of the game is the loot system.  The items themselves are well thought-out, though mostly direct upgrades.  Some of the late-game items are ridiculously powerful though, causing a massive snowball effect which can be enjoyable, but just makes the game even easier.  Where the item system really shows its weakness, however, is in the drops.  I have never had such a big case of "what the hell do I do with all this money" in an RPG.  Gold and crafting materials drop nonstop, and by selling a crafting material to the shop, you cause it to be stocked, gaining one in the store every couple minutes.  By the end of the game there were more than 200 copies of half the crafting materials stocked.  What could I possibly do with them?  Later in the game, you will also find tons of blacksmithing blueprints, the vast majority of which will be useless or not craftable until after you can already buy the item.\n\nDespite having a lot to say about the weaknesses of the game, they are only very small marks against it.  The game is still fantastic overall and one I would not hesitate to recommend.  Even though the combat is very easy and the controls a bit unresponsive, it's still fun.  Overabundant loot and useless blacksmithing recipes don't affect the game much, though it makes me wonder how much better the game could have been if these things were improved.\n\nAs a last note I did run into a few bugs in the game.  There's a persistent stutter every couple seconds while playing that seems to pop up whenever you enter a new map and clears up after a couple minutes.  It's a bit annoying.  The game also crashed trying to play the ending cinematic which is a first for me.","March 6, 2014","true","14.6"," 156 of 177 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","156","177","0","7"

The visuals in the screenshots look absolutely stunning. Dust has been out since early 2013 and it has that real polished feeling of a fantastic game.  Essentially this is a hack and slash, RPG, side scroller. The combat system is basic, but does exactly what you need it to do. All of the attacks look and feel satisfying, as well as the parry system which normally is something that gets overlooked in a lot of games like this.\n\nThe musical score behind Dust is somewhat of a masterpiece too. I am surprised they haven’t released just the sound track as it is beautifully crafted.  The level design on offer here is interesting too. Each "zone" is split into separate areas, which can be a little daunting at first because they are all huge. One gripe I did find is that the map in game isn't very clear and can sometimes cause confusion as to where you actually are on it.\n\nAs I said above, the combat system is basic, so this means you can master it very easily. There are a few combos to learn as you progress, as well as a welcome addition of a crafting mechanic. I also liked the feature where if you sold something to a shop, they would then stock this in the future so you can buy multiple copies of it; this is really helpful when you are trying to craft your armour and weapons.\n\nThis took me roughly twenty hours to complete everything on offer, main story line, challenges and side quests. The game did feel slightly repetitive towards the end of the last chapter however.\n\nI would really recommend you pick up Dust: An Elysian Tail, you can more often than not find it on sale, but I would still recommend this at full price.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

That's a rarity, especially in the kind of mainstream stuff you buy on Steam or XBLA.\n\nThat was the reason I bought it at first, but I finally got around to playing and it wound up being the best $2.99 I ever spent and a game that might actually break the top 10 on my list of all time favorite games.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice going in is that the graphics are BEAUTAFUL and there's some real nice fine detail in the animations like the fabric of Dust's clothes rippling as he moves. The effects like explosions, projectale attacks, and lighting are also really pretty and can result in some great atmosphere and awesome moments during combat. It feels almost like an interactive cartoon at times.\n\nIt also ran maxed out flawlessly on my 750ti/FX-8320 at a solid 60FPS that only dropped to 51 during loading and cutscenes, but I think that's more an issue with how the game load assets than something that more horse-power or optimization is going to fix\n\nThe second thing is the story is great and will more than likely bring you close to tears on far more than one occasion, I can only describe the emotional rollercoaster than ensues from the ending of the second chapter onwards as something that wants to break you one way or the other. The story has some fantasy cliches, but it uses them well to paint a world that world that likable because it would be unashamably idealistic if it wasn't at war. I'd almost say it remained that way in spite of itself because all the drama and heartache makes it feel very much like you're earning a happy ending for all the people you help along the way.\n\nThe game also has a welcome sense of humor in it's lighter movemets that comes from hanging a lampshade on common RPG tropes like stuffing huge items in your pockets or random fetch-quests.\n\nThe gameplay is a simple side-scrolling RPG with Castlevania exploration and some pretty hefty rewards for putting the effort to cheack everywhere and uncover every secrect in the gameworld. The combat is very much a button-mashing that relies on timing and keeping up with on-screen action to rack-up combos and avoid getting hit instead of complicated combos or a huge arsenal of moves.\n\nSo yeah, I'd say this is worth a buy and a place in anyone's libraiy.","June 8, 2015","true","22.0"," 77 of 88 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","77","88","3","1"

It's one of the few games in recent years I almost played through twice (my Steam library grows almost daily, so that kinda means something) and which I have very fond memories of.\n\nIt's a very special title because it was designed with much love and confidence and shows so in a variety of ways. If I had to name a game that not only looked like a charm but worked and felt just the same it would be Dust: An Elysian Tail. It was backed up by Microsoft as an original XBox Live Arcade game and took almost four years to make but was created mostly by just one guy.\n\nDust: AET is a Metroidvania action platformer (meaning you discover new powers along the way and do some backtracking with them) with a clean interface, gorgeous art, fantastic music, nice story, adorable characters, great voice acting, solid combat, rudimentary leveling/gear/crafting/shopping mechanics and platforming of mild/average difficulty.\n\nDespite what some other reviewers/players/press people say: I love the voice acting. It's warm and colorful and fits the equally colorful style of the game (which does not mean it's an immature game; although some young deers running past me gave me some Disney vibes and some overarching topics include classic "teenage"-ishy things like the protagonist and his sidekick growing with their responsibilty along the journey there sure are some darker moods and themes too like war and genocide). Some people don't like the VA or certain characters but I think they are being unfair or misunderstand something. I think the VA is nailing it down and just like it was meant to be. it's cute and sweet and just nice, with much heart and soul that could be credited to a set of relatively new/inexperienced but maybe even more so passionate VAs. This is one of the few games where I had urges to look up contact data of the voice actors only so I could thank them for their efforts. I think I know bad voice acting when I see it and Dust: AET has none of that.\n\nThe music is fantastic. Again, in this game specifically, I noticed a behavior I don't see too often, least not that I would've been aware of it in other games as much: Some levels I loved to roam a couple of more times, or stay in them for a bit longer than I really had to, so I could keep listening to the powerful tracks running along some more. The always very beautiful art even in the somewhat "gloomy" levels added to it and made the game, with all the other things it has to offer, a constantly enjoyable and remarkably well-rounded experience from start to end.\n\nThe story is kinda interesting and ends fairly conclusive. Some questions remain unanswered though. Apparently there was more planned to it, what turned out to be game was originally meant to be an animated film called "Elysian Tail" and you can tell by some lore ideas that are sometimes brought up but not elaborated too much. Like what exactly the talking sword you're wielding is (there were meant to be seven of those, it seems, but the game never brings that up) or how your funny and adorable sidekick "Fidget" came to be a "Guardian" of that sword in the first place.\n\nSo, I'd love to see a sequel sometime in the future when the creator feels for it (well, all who appreciate this game as the gem it is seem to do). And maybe a Fidget plushie.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbboCU9Gy8A\nhttps://youtu.be/5MdtgOTl60o\nOld review:\n\nFluid and fun combat, beautiful art, great colorful voice acting, well-enough outlined and varied characters and some pretty fantastic music. A very well executed action title. The story holds some interesting points but the overall scheme has been seen before (mysterious hero with no memories of his past helping some rebel faction fighting some evil force). The combat, crafting and leveling seems a bit underdeveloped (only few combos, button smashing was often proving to be enough on "normal") but that didn't really hinder my fun with it. Probably best played on "hardcore" or "tough" difficulty - "normal" felt easy too me except for some boss battles.","October 16, 2015","true","52.5"," 49 of 52 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","49","52","3","0"

When I first met Dust, I did not think much of him.\nHe felt generic, not showing his face, having amnesia and struggling to find out where he came from. I did not connect much with the furry man, as such a story is hardly original.\nFortunately, his gameplay did connect with me from the start. He hacked and slashed like a true soldier, finding keys, treasures, abilities, upgrades and many more fine, fun things in true MetroidVania fashion. One could even find a small funny easter egg related to the horrible CastleVania II when you look hard enough(You'll chuckle when you find it). With such gameplay and 2D graphics, one might ask if such a game has still the right to exist amongst contemporary gamers. The answer is a loud and clear YES.\n\nFrom Whence it Came\n\nAs I travelled through the world of Falana, I was amazed how much I did start to connect with Dust now. The man was truly regretful of his past and sought to redeem himself through every possible noble deed he could manage. My little companion Fidget started to grow on me too. Being a flying whatever-the-♥♥♥♥-its-name-is with a high-pitched voice and a knack for being scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and knowing everything better, the little critter soon turned into a lifelong friend of mine.\n\nAnd of course there was Ahra, the mystical and mysterious (Wow, never thought to use 2 words in the same sentence starting with 'my') sword. What was his purpose? What was our purpose with him? What did he know about us and what did he keep silent from us? The plot started to deepen, becoming ever more emotional from chapter to chapter.\nThe journey felt like a personal growth, a new sense of understanding the world.\n\nRising Phoenix\nHacking and slashing through hordes of enemies is fun, but not necessarily very hard. Granted, I finished the game on normal, but even on normal I did not die many times. Fortunately, there are two extra difficulty levels (tough + hardcore), which can be set from the very first playthrough.\n\nAs mentioned, Dust can be upgraded and level up, giving you the option to invest more in Dust's defense, attack or Fidget (the flying critter has interesting powers). Items can be crafted from materials that you gather from fallen enemies, such as pendants, rings, armor and augments. The only downside to the crafting is that you do not actually see Dust wearing the item. Also old school I guess.\n\nIf grinding to get all the materials you need isn't your thing, there is a nice mechanic with a travelling salesman that follows you throughout your travels. Sell him one piece of a particular material he doesn't have and he'll "catalogue" it. After that, he will update his stock over time and provide you with the materials you once sold him.\n\n...And the Dust Settles\n\nAfter clearing the final area and defeating the final boss, I realized something. I actually cried at the ending of this visually stunning video game. Being created by just a SINGLE person (aside from the story and music), this game is something very, very special. For little money you get at least 10 hours of gameplay, make that 20 hours if you're a completionist like me.\nThe gameplay is solid, the controls are fine and the story and progression are perfect.\nThis is an indie game which could easily be viewed as a triple AAA title.\n\nGameplay: 7.5/10\nStory: 9/10\nControls: 8/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nMy final, personal score: 8.5/10","June 22, 2014","true","0.2"," 84 of 106 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","84","106","0","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericjdouglas/recommended/236090/","ericjdouglas","koala fish mutant bird","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericjdouglas/","561 products in account","Imagine if Disney joined forces with Rankin/Bass[en.wikipedia.org] (producers of 1977's The Hobbit[www.imdb.com], 1982's The Last Unicorn[www.imdb.com] and various cartoons like ThunderCats[www.imdb.com] and SilverHawks[www.imdb.com]) and made a beat 'em up RPG. Now imagine that instead of all that, one guy made a game that pretty much equals what you'd get otherwise. He didn't have the relentless marketing or the massive capital of Disney, etc., yet he still sold 1 mil plus copies of Dust, and why? 'Cause it ain't bad, ain't bad at all.\n\nThe star of this game is the combat, which needs only one word to describe it: fun. Right there, Dust nails the cardinal rule of gamemaking: make it fun. And it is. Early on, you obtain the bulk of your magical-talking-sword-fighting mechanics with a whirling dervish sword attack called the Dust Storm and magical projectiles from your cheerfully snarky companion, Fidget, which combined make it possible to let loose ridiculous combos on your opponents, by combining a few staple sword moves with the two aforementioned special moves and the fact that Dust Storm will launch you into the air so you can endlessly slash at monsters all the way across the screen, high up into the air and back down again with nary a pause in the combat 'til they're all dead. Again: fun. Simple, uncomplicated fun. There's a lot of combat across 10+ areas, and if you backtrack (which you will if you want to track down the secrets/collectibles which include a lot of fun little nods to other indie darlings) it does unfortunately get a little tiny bit old because the earlier enemies do not level with you, but it's such a small gripe because it's still just plain fun to tear the crap out of them with the incredibly responsive swordplay. If I had any caveat about the combat it would be to advise you to play the game on a harder difficulty than normal; I more or less suck at twitch combat and I found myself breezing through the majority of it on normal. So, just a thought.\n\nMy enjoyment of the combat in Dust far outshined anything else during my time with the game, which is great because -- and here's where I have to be a little bit of a jerk -- my first impressions were less than sparkling. I picked up Dust in a Humble Bundle, and probably would not have bought it by itself because it is marketed exactly as how I described it in the beginning of this review: it heavily features anthropomorphized animals in the Disney tradition and the story and voiceacting has a distinctly "anime" feel to it, and to be completely honest, neither of those are what I look for in games. Or anywhere else for that matter. I'll leave it at that; suffice to say, I was not expecting to be wowed by Dust from the first few minutes of the game. Having played through it, I would have to say that Dust hits the sweet spot of having great appeal to its core audience and at the same time having enough artistic chops to satisfy the rest of us who aren't perhaps into the same thing. There's a lot of comic relief in the banter between the main character and his companion, and a few touching moments in the story, an otherwise plain "who the hell am I" plot. It's not as bad as it could be, though some of the voiceacting really borders on laughable and/or unlistenable at times. This is all just my opinion, of course, so don't hit me or anything; fact of the matter is that this will appeal to some people and not others. If you can get past the trappings of the story, there is an awesome game waiting underneath, it's just a question of how much eye-rolling you're willing to put up with.\n\nAnd here's another reason you should just suck it up: the art in this game is freaking gorgeous. Every new level is hand-painted and lovingly animated, with special mention for the waterfalls in the underground levels. Just pure eye-candy, and it looks even better while you're kicking tail all over the place. It is clear that the development of Dust was very much a labor of love, because I repeat, the art is beautiful!\n\nIt's a very fun game, it's an amazing achievement for such a small studio, and it serves as a good reminder not to judge a book by its cover.","June 27, 2014","true","80.4"," 77 of 97 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","77","97","0","7"

Those alone seemed to be amazing and played a decisive factor. At first, given all the reviews, I was a bit sceptycal. I was afraid that it would be an over hyped game by the community and in the end it would something bland. Fortunately, it wasnt the case.\n\nSo the big plus on Dust:\n+ amazing visuals (except cut scenes - those appear to be from early free flash games)\n+ cool combat system. Amazingly fluid!\n+ cool soundtrack\n+ interesting level construction\n+ Easy to play and to master\n+ gameplay length just right\n\nThe bad:\n- Story is rather generic (it has a couple of twists, but nothing unseen before or trully unpredictable)\n- may become repetitive at times\n- can´t seem to skip some cut-scenes.\n- perhaps a "nightmare" mode should be considered\n\nI think those minus can even be neglected / forgotten given the quality of the game. I can imagine myself playing it over again in a couple of years time.\n\nI had fun playing this game. I took my time to make my character quite strong (I think I was level 50  - 52 when I finished the game. I had a lot of fun in some levels, and loved the final boss battle. I have finished the game, recovered my last save, gained a couple of levels only to play the final boss battle again.\n\nI thought that the game could be a bit more difficult. Appart from a couple of situations that were actually tricky, you can almost go through the whole game without actually feeling that you are in an eminent risk of dying. However, this is a dream game at every level for a younger audiance.\n\nMy recommendation - get the game and play it. You will often find it on steam sales w 75% discount (I have seen it like that 3 or 4 times until decided that I should buy it), but after playing it, I feel that the full price would be a fair deal.\n\nHope the analysis was useful for all the undecided.\n\nCheers,\nLatinnus","November 1, 2014","true","26.1"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","45","49","2","1"

There's way more to the game then just the story though! The platforming is good and the combat is fine. The art is simply amazing and the music is extremely good also!\n\nI can't believe i've stopped playing about 1 hour in when I bought this game back in 2013.

I had fun going back to other maps just to learn of secret rooms.\n\n- Great Combo System\nThe combo system is spot on in my opinion, specially for keyboard users with minimun controls so anyone can pick it up and try all of the combos without having to master the game. Not many games like this are spot on for keyboard users but this one is for sure.\nI had so much fun comboing the enemies and it never felt like a chore, you really feel the damage you are doing in every swing of your sword.\n\n- No Material Grinding\nThe shop system is a  lovely touch, trade in a material you found and the shop will restock it over time, helping to lower the need to grind for materials so you can focus on the story.\n\n- Beautiful Story\nI was shocked and crying when I found out who Dust was, for ages I was curious from others reviews thinking it couldn't be any different then most cliche games have but I am so happy I was wrong. You really feel sorry for the characters including a few NPC's who you do quests for.\nOne of the more original plot-twists to a story I have seen in a while, specially for a video game.\n\n- Funny Characters\nThis game is full of sad and funny characters all standing out from one another. I don't think I need to mention how Sassy Fidget can be while also being adorable. Some NPC's also have some lively comments to add into the humor of the game and make them appear more lively and not just there to be mere NPC's.\n\n\nI really would recommend this to anyone, not just those who are into the Hack & Slash genre of games.

The combat is fun, but does wear a little thin near the end thanks to not much variety.

Dust is your name, but who really are you? I do not usually care about the storyline in games, but Dust: An Elysian Tail has kept me very interested from start to finish.\n\nVery early in the game you find a magic sword, who knows everything, but will not tell you anything! The magic sword wants you to take him with you as he will guide you on your journey ahead, and you use him for combat. You will be companied by a tiny, little, flying creature called Fidget who had been protecting the sword until you showed up. Fidget is my favourite character in Dust: An Elysian Tail. She is very adorable and makes you giggle, so cute. However she is not only there for the humoristic side, she is very helpful for combat and to learn new skills as you progress your game that are very effective.\n\nDust: An Elysian Tail is a platforming game with simple RPG features. You follow your main quest while also being handed side quests that mostly are about finding missing people or finding an item and hand it back to that person. You earn experience and loot by completing quests and defeating enemies, which allow you to level up and upgrade one of the four passive skills. The game also offers a crafting system where if you find blueprints you are able to craft the loot if you picked up the required materials for it. The RPG element does not go deep in Dust: An Elysian Tail as it is very basic but otherwise is implemented very well.\n\nDust: An Elysian Tail is a short game, but it is generally very enjoyable during the entire play through. I like how the story goes, how the game is being played, and I love the art style a lot. It is very pretty to look at, glittering and colourful. I especially felt dragged in during the snow levels, mixed with the soundtrack. Oh, and Fidget! Fidget, Fidget Fidget~!\n\nMy only complaint is that the cutscenes of Dust: An Elysian Tail. There are only like three of them, and they come at the end of the game, but they are very awkward to watch and not well done at all. Compared to everything else about the game, the cut scenes just fall hard and should not have been there. I was disappointed they had to resort to cutscenes.

During the past month of so, I've played a lot of Dust: An Elysian Tail, and I enjoyed every single minute of it. This is one of those games I bought during this year's Summer Sales, at a very neat price. It's basically a 2D sidescroller hack and slash game, with basic RPG elements. You play as Dust, a strange character who doesn't know where he is, who he is or what he has to do. There a two friends on your journey: a magical sword, and one of the most cute characters EVER in a game: Fidget, who has to look after the sword. It took me only minutes to fall in love with Fidget, especially thanks to the exceptional voice-acting. The story may look bland at first sight, but actually is very good and cleverly built: there is one mani storyline throughout the game which unfolds in an often unexpected but still easy-to-follow way.\n\nAs far as the actual gameplay is concerned, Dust mainly focuses on swift attacting combo's (which are ideally suited for an Xbox 360 gamepad, the game actually being an Xbox-port) and some jumping and puzzle-solving action. None of these are really difficult, but there are some hidden places which need some skill to be found, and six arena's that offer a good challenge to anyone. Combat combo's are limited, and once one gets up to strength by levelling up, things get a bit too easy. During the last third or so of the game, I felt like incincible, only to realise at the very end I needed all my strenght for the final boss fight. I strongly suggest playing the game on the "hard" difficulty setting - it will be difficult during the first hour or so, but then the extra challenge really pays of.\n\nVisually, Dust is stunning. The combines a gorgeous 2D sidescrolling scenery with a handpainted look with very distinctive figures of all characters, used during the dialogues. Some of these are so cute that I'd like to have them printed out and hung above my bedside. The visual style gives the game an unique artistic look: it feels like having a soul of its own, just like a good comics book or a series of drawings. Soundwise, Dust is a blast as well, with very well suited music, and absolutely fantastic sound-effects, not to mention the exceptional voice-acting.\n\nAll in all, this is a gem of a game, a non-pretentious masterwork with a touch very much of its own. I can't think of any other game using the same visual style, nor the adorable cuteness of Fidget.\n\nGameplay: 24/30 (there could be more of a challenge during the later parts of the game, and the rpg-element feels a bit underdeveloped, but all the rest, including exemplary controls and inventory is perfect)\nGrapics: 18/20 (gorgeous, and with made with obvious love for the game)\nSound: 9/10\nLongelivety: 7/10 (it's a quite long game all the sidequests included, but once finished, I felt no need for a second playthrough)\nSteam integration: 8/10 (there are trading cards and a good bunch of achievements, cleverly devised)\nTechnical: 10/10 (running flawless really)\nPersonal appreciation: 10/10\n\nOverall: 86/100\n\nGo and get it, and enjoy it to the full.","August 30, 2014","true","28.8"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","5"

As everyone else has said, there's a lot of metriod-vania aspects to the game. And the platforming reminds me exactly of the first rayman game ;p. Especially dem floating platforms. Oh boy, some of those levels in Rayman 1 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off so much....anyway, I digress.\n\nThe gameplay elements are very polished, if a little simple. The RPG elements fit in nicely with the rest of the game.\nThe controls are surprisingly good and responsive. If you keep dying, it's not the games fault. You just aren't very good at it.\n\nThe story..alright, it's pretty predictable, and cheesy at times, but I liked it. So that *obviously* means it was good. If you go for only the story, it's a short game, but still fun.\n\nOh, and the visuals, soundtrack, sound effects? ...perfect. I've heard plenty of people complain about the voice acting, but I thought it fitted in well with the game. Maybe that's just me though.\n\nI can't say much that is bad about this game, because I genuinely can't think of much to say. I would point out that there are some repetitive parts, but I didn't find the whole thing repetitive, because every stage looks so beautiful and usually a new element is added for each new area.\n\nAll in all, this has to be my one of my favourite games on steam. Certainly worth $15, and if you get it cheaper, it's a steal.\n\nI won't give a numerical rating, but know this; I highly doubt you'll regret getting this game.\n\n\n\n\nSounds like the review is over, eh? But the scrolly thing isn't at the bottom. Yes, there is more to come, but feel free to ignore it.\n\n\n\nThis game is good, and can I just say, if you genuinely think it's a fault that the characters are anthros, please read on, and wake up.\n\nWhy does this bother you? It doesn't mean it's a furry game. That's like saying rachet and clank is a furry game. Does noone else think this adds an extra charm to the game? Imagine this game, or ratchet and clank if all the characters had been human. Alright, it wouldn't have ruined the game, but I reckon it wouldn't have been as fun.\n\nSo please...just accept a brilliant game for what it is.","January 5, 2015","true","19.5"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","29","33","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/236090/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","An action/platforming RPG in the vein of Castlevania, Dust drew me in, hook, line, and sinker.\n\nThe game puts you in the shoes of an anthropomorphic amnesiac called Dust, and teams him up with floating friend Fidget and wizened talking sword Ahrah. Together, the three of you travel the land of Falana, righting wrongs and uncovering the secrets of Dust's true identity. The plot walks a tight balancing act between family-friendly and dire darkness, and while it's successful overall, some characters (Fidget) do tend to add a somewhat childish, yet still charming flavor to the tale. Despite the world's somewhat medieval vibe, the dialogue is wholly modern, which is oddly jarring, but in a Disney-film-set-in-the-olden-days-but-everyone-talks-like-it's-1990 sort of way. The banter between the three leads is mostly fun, and goes a long way to establishing them as companions — and eventually, friends.\n\nAs I mentioned, the game unfolds much in the same way as the Symphony of the Night flavor of Castlevanias: explore a variety of locations in 2D space, gather new equipment and ability upgrades to slowly expand your movement possibilities, fight lots of enemies and bosses, help out others via side quests, and gather hidden treasure. While Dust only has access to his sword and several of Fidget's magical projectiles, the tight physics and the outstanding combat keep the game feeling exciting all the way through. Mixing and matching various attacks and combos is thrilling, and combined with the awesome animation, the battles are utterly chaotic and begin to seem like one epic, violent dance. The final level and battle of the game are an utter symphony of carnage. Fortunately, the controls are tight, and you're very much in control of every slash, smash, and dodge. Dust occasionally turns to face a target other than the one desired, but it doesn't happen nearly often enough to really bother me. Also, while the entire game felt very fair, there is one particular enemy late in the adventure that can break all of the established rules of battle. Parrying you while facing the opposite direction or knocked down to the ground and dodging into the background with far greater frequency than even the final boss, this enemy felt a little cheap — though this is admittedly a nitpick that only affects the final hour or two of the game.\n\nVisually, Dust looks like what every Disney game from the 1990's aspired to be. The hand-drawn background art is gorgeous and diverse, and the character models are big, colorful, and move with a fluid grace that gives Rayman a run for his lums. There are numerous particle effects like rain, wind, snow, and ash, and tons of dramatic lighting and blur effects during combat. If 2D graphics were food, I would eat Dust all day.\n\nThe musical score is deep, emotional, and diverse, and lends a huge degree of weight to the various locations and scenes it underscores. There's plenty of audio feedback during combat and in menus too, and all of it lives up to the high-water mark set by the graphics and music. The voice acting is generally pretty good — Dust in particular gives a great performance — but a few here and there (Fidget) are a wee bit cutesy for my taste. Still, no character's voice is outright bad.\n\nThe PC version automatically detects your control setup and changes the menu layout to suit your choice of mouse and keyboard, keyboard, or gamepad. Keyboard/mouse combinations are certainly serviceable, but the best way to play is undoubtedly with a controller in your hands. There's also a nice selection of knobs and dials to prettify your visual experience if you've got the hardware for it. Considering all of that, Dust absolutely makes a great transition to PC.\n\nThe game has a set of four difficulty options, the usual suite of Steam achievements, and several challenge rooms for you to struggle with, as well. Playing on hardcore difficulty and completing 100% of the game took me in the neighborhood of 19 hours, so there's certainly plenty of game here for the price, too. Dust was undoubtedly a labor of love by its creator, and it shows. This game oozes craft, artistry, and love, and shows it off in every facet of its design. There's great gameplay, graphics, music, and heart here, and I have no reservations whatsoever in wholeheartedly recommending it to anyone that enjoys these kinds of games.\n\nA Must Play\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 22, 2014","true","40.2"," 36 of 48 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","36","48","2","0"

Great art design, music, story, and characters. Just fun to play. Game was made by ONE guy doing all the animations and the coding and it looks like a AAA title. Only had help with the music and story. Must buy for Indie fans and ARPG fans. One of the best console to PC ports ever. PErfectly ported. Full gamepad support, k/m, AND keyboard only.\n\nThe game has a very cute set of characters and may give you a few tears as well. Fidget will either annoy you, or make you go "dawwwwww". Made me go "dawwww".\n\nThe game is a fast paced action combat in a side scrolling form. Characters are all anomorphic style. You are able to level up with RPG elements, and you play as a guy Dust with his sidekick Fidget. Fidget adds a new element to your fighting style and unlocks new powers as you play. You combine with Fidget to make even more powerful combos.\n\nThere are a bunch of Easter Eggs in this game too actually. With some really odd puzzles giving homage to some of the greatest Indie titles ever. The treasure chests are sometimes hidden ad clues are given with notes you find as well. You will love seeing some of the amazing alternate worlds that the Easter Eggs provide. Sending you to strange areas to find them in short little levels that try to use the mechanics for the gme and Easter Egg you are looking for. It is relaly cool.\n\nSupport this guy and buy this game. It is truly great and as one guy this is a great accomplishment and the game is incredibly fun.\n\nGame also has trading cards.","December 2, 2013","true","67.6"," 34 of 47 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","34","47","0","5"

Combat heavy but not light on exploration.  Good characters and voice acting.  Great environments.  Lots of good action (though maybe a bit simple).

Unfortunately, the cutscenes are way below the game level, I feel like they haven't put much effort into it as much as they put into the game, Which kinda ruined some moments for me. Also the bosses are very weak, you can keep them in mid-air with Dust Storm, damaging them until they die.\n\n\nThe Characters:\nThe main characters in the game are very unique, look and personality, Unfortunately some the side characters look generic and aren't very special, I'm talking about some of the side quest characters. It doesn't effect the gameplay though. Dust, Fidget and Ahrah make a perfect team!\n\nOverall:\nDust: An Elysian Tail is a 2D Action-RPG + Platformer + Hack n' Slash game mixed together, It has a great story, music, and game mechanics, the only downside for me was the cutscenes and the unchallenging boss fights, I'll happily name it my Favourite Indie game of all time, and one of my favourite games aswell, I'll proudly give it  8.5/10","December 17, 2014","true","23.1"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","8"

The game where you actually believe in the adventure, where you actually feel yourself inside this world. It's a tale that goes on for a great period of time and makes you savour every single momment of it. And in the end. After dedication, amazing gameplay, character interaction. It's one of those rare games\n\nWhere you do not want the story to end.\n\n\nAnd who wouldn't really? This game is a jewel. This game is EVERYTHING you could ever possibly want. Lemme explain it to you.\n\nA bit of background. First of all this game was made by one guy. Dean Dodrill. Keep that in mind when I go on and say he spent four complete years on this project.\n\nVery dedicated guy for the content he made. I assure you.\n\nAnd I assure you. There is going to be more. Judging by the story content and every bit of plot it throws at you. Along with the confirmation of the developper. There is going to be more someday. Not now. But someday.\n\nWhy am I excited? Here are my thoughts during the entire gameplay.\n\nThe first thing you see when oppening the game are the graphics. A luscious rain falls on the background and as soon as you begin the game you realise something really, REALLY cool. (Sidenote This port on Computer really adapts itself well for an Xbox port. If my memory doesn't fail me you can plug an Xbox controller if you wish. But why would you do that when the Pc settings are so well ported?),\n\nThe game is hand drawn. In fact. EVERYTHING is hand drawn and well colored. The colors are flashy and memorable, including the amazing shade of blue your main character has. Every landscapes from plants to creatures to other characters, buildings. All of it is hand drawn.\n\nIt's nuts. Every thing Was designed for it to be absolutely Stunning making me gaze in awe and wonder like a 10 year old a couple of times. So when it comes to quality. It is heartwarming.\nI love it. and it makes me think alot about Child Of Light and Rayman Origins which are both great.\n\nSo you begin this game and the game throws you this simple almost fairy tale like story.\n\nYou are Dust, A cloaked and straw-hat wearing swordman who has woken up in the forest, alone, who can't remember his own path, and his guided by a magical sword accross the land to repel the evil racist millitary campaign of General Gaius. And so you take on the fight along with your trusty Nimbat sidekick named Fidget to both save the land and remember who you are in the proccess.\n\nRecapped like that it, sounds like absolute cheese. But it's not. I assure you that this very basic and simple plot holds a lot more within it than you could think. You end up caring a lot towards both the main characters within the story. Your partner, Fidget, looking very similar to Daxter from the Jak series, probably has the most adorable and well thought personality that I have ever seen. Her voice her comments her attitude, everything about this side kick is incredibly adorable. And she actually helps you along the way by providing you some of the best attacks in the game when combined with the sword making you feel like she is actually really useful. Something rare from a sidekick.\n\nThe story is one of those fairy tale stories that are meant to keep you enchanted along the way. And I absolutely love it.\n\nThe gameplay works as a 2D beat em all type of games with a, although lacking in numbers, selection of very useful combos meant for every situation. As all the combos are worth using, you do not really feel the need to add any other combos into it. There is also a great parry system included which you need to use well in order to beat certain monsters.\n\nYou also gain experience and money outside of combat allowing you to level the stats of your main character and buy items and equipments. Defeating ennemies allows you to gain ingredients from them for you to combine and create stronger weapons, rings and armor making it for a constant character progression as you wander the land.\n\nQuests are given to you giving your new locations and purposes to do things in exchange of very very useful rewards. Some of these quests are absolutely crazy with good ideas (The box quest being one of my favorite).\n\nOutside of combat. It is an exploration game very similar to Metroid. You search the land for secrets the map is separated into rooms and your characters gains new abillities as you advance making you feel this constant progression.\n\nLevel designs are stunning. When I said you explore the land. You EXPLORE the land. With all of it's hazards you go through forests, plains, cavers, mountains, tundra's, ghost house's, volcanoes. Giving you a lot of variety for level exploration and enviromental hazards like poisonous mushrooms and  spikes, mines, avalanches, lava. Making it just a jolly good ride all the way.\n\nI cannot find a single flaw in the gameplay except for the higher difficulties setting.\n\nThose are only minor nitpicks. For example. Hardest difficulty setting, you are zero invincibility frames and hazards are increased in frequency. (Like poison mushrooms spraying on the floor more frequently). It makes certain environment hazard a complete atrocious pain and almost a difficulty spike in certain areas as the hazards are just shooting everywhere (You will see once you reach the cave level on the hardest setting). Another example would be that if you fell in a pile of lava. There is a good chance that on the harder difficulty setting you might get stuck endlessly in lava due to you having no invincibility frames making it a pain when.\n\nSPOILER\n\nFighting the last boss in a volcano filled with instant killing lava where as in a lower difficulty setting, you could easily jump away after getting lava-burned.\n\nEND OF SPOILER.\n\nThat's a very small nitpick though. The rest of the game is mighty fine and challenging in the other difficulties making it an amazing experience all the way through.\n\nAnd yes. For a beat em up. The game is 20 hours long on average. Which is almost twice as long than a usual beat em up.\n\nDid i say this game was made by one person?\n\nShould I really tell you if it's good or not? From what I said above, this game is an absolute godsend made out of gold and pristine quality.\n\nIt was so good I did not want it to end.\n\nHow many games have ever given you this feeling of pure commitment?\n\nIt is one of the rare games I will never forget and treasure in my heart forever.\n\nSo in recap\n\nPros:\n\nAmazing hand drawn graphic almost shimmering you blind with their beauty.\nGreat combat gameplay with crafting and a level up system making you feel progress all the way through.\nMetroid/Catlevania exploration to the finest degrees rewarding you with both upgrades and easter eggs.\nFidget.\nVery in depth story overall that starts off pretty slow and cheesy and slowly escalates into something great.\nFidget.\nFidget.\nIt's only 15$ while it could easily top alot of triple A 60$ titles on the market.\n20 hours long gameplay which is a great bargain for only 15$.\nGreat finale along with a certainty of a sequel (More Fidget) in the future.\n\nCons:\nUnforgiving environmental hazards at higher difficulty.\nA sort of slow and cheesy start when it comes to story telling (Gets way better after a while)\nBoss fights are a little deceiving but great nonetheless.\n\nOther than that, It is pure gold and I recommend you to buy it for yourself. Buy it as a gift for your friends. Support Dean Dodrill (He deserves all the praises in the world). I can't tell you how much this game has claimed such a cozy spot in my heart. Probably one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nSo get this game.\nYou will love it i assure you.\nYou will play this game gazing upong it's amazing story and gameplay. Laughing in joy.\nAnd will slowly reach the end of your journey and more and more you will feel this anguish building up inside you.\nAnd mutter.\nI don't want this tale to end.\n","November 29, 2014","true","21.7"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/236090/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","After seeing the game in the Microsoft Sale for just 2€, and watching a huge amount of reviews calling this game "close to perfection" and giving rates like 4/5, 9,5/10, and even a few perfect scores for both profesional reviews, and even players from Steam, I decided to give it a try, to see what's the hype all about. And if there's something I can't stand, are lies. This game was NOWHERE close to perfection, and it does feel unfinished at times. I still had fun, and I still think this game is worth the purchase in a good sale, but let me explain everything properly, and as usual, I will start with the stuff the game does NOT do well:\n\nFirst of all, and for me, the biggest dissapointment I had with the game, is the difficulty. OR RATHER, THE LACK OF ANY. This game is HELL EASY. Want to know something else? I started my first playthrough of the game on the hardest difficulty, "Extreme", hoping to get an enthrilling experience, like when you play Dark Souls for the first time. And what did I found out? All the difficulty does, IS JUST MAKE ENEMIES HURT MORE. That's NOT difficulty, that's ARTIFICIAL DIFFICULTY. AND IT SUCKS. It doesn't matter if the enemies kill me in two hits, WHEN I CAN STILL KILL THEM IN ONE! Specially in this game, where the Devs put a lot of work into the Dodge moves. Yeah, enemies kill me in one hit, BUT THEY CAN'T EVEN HIT ME. THAT SURE IS EXTREME! IS IT ALSO POWERED BY MOUNTAIN DEW? This lack of difficulty reaches the highest settings of stupidity on the bossess. There are, literally, just 4 legit bosses on the game, and a handful of mini-bosses, that are nothing but enemies you'll find later in the game anyway. And are those bossess extreme? HELL NO, THEY'RE EVEN WEAKER THAN NORMAL ENEMIES, HOW IN THE ACTUAL F#CK IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE, MICROSOFT!? And if that wasn't laughable enough, you can buy gems that will revive you to full-health whenever you're defeated. They're just expensive, but I had a good amount of them when I reached the last stage of the game, anyway, because I had WAY TOO MUCH GOLD (more on that later). The only thing this difficulty does achieve, is making the dangers of the dungeons and maps become ACTUALLY DANGEROUS. The Ice-caverns, for example, where ice-shards drop from the ceiling? I liked that part, because it required some skill, timing and luck to dodge them, but getting hit once was an insta-kill.\n\nAnother issue I have with the game, is that it's rather short. It took me 13 hours to complete it at 113% (I still don't know why the hell it says 113% and not 100%...), getting god-damn everything, rescuing every "friend", and all the side-quests done. If I didn't bother to do all of those things, I would have probably gone through the entire game in 6 or so. I did just spend 2€ on the game, so it's fine for me, but think about the people who paid full price. And no, it doesn't really have much replayability. Just a few achievements you can't get in the first run of the game (mainly because you have to choose one thing or another, but you can indeed get them on the first try by making two different saves).\n\nThe third big issue about the game, is the Item system. Don't get me wrong in this, it's an amazing idea. But sadly, it feels rushed and unfinished. Nearly all enemies on the game drop a huge amount of different items you can use to make items. What's the deal? Those items you can build with blueprints, can later be bought anyway, so I found myself ignoring completely the crafting aspect of the game, and sold every loot-item I got right away. And I still beated the game without much trouble... And what I said before, I ain't kidding: A Goblin, or a Soldier, drop the same items as a ugly giant spider, or EVEN A GOD-DAMN FIGHT-JET. Only a few of them drop unique items, and most of them are either expensive, or only good for crafting.\n\nThe last issue with the game, are the enemies. Like I said before, bosses are a complete joke (beated most of them without even taking damage, even the final boss, who has 4 fights in a row, that I beated on the first try, and didn't took damage on the first two), but the normal enemies are no different at times. Pretty much 80% of the enemies in the game will do nothing but to rush at you blindly, and if there's anything on the way, they might get stuck, or rather commit suicide by falling into a river of magma, or getting impared by spikes/ice-shards.  The rest of the enemies are okay, though...Except one. In the "Graveyard-like" dungeon, where you have to roam arround to find 4 items for a old-lady, you will mainly find 3 enemies: Zombies that share the same dumb IA as most enemies, Zombies with giant tumors on their heads that, for some reason, act as the Creepers from Minecraft and explode when you get near them, and Necromancers, who deal NO damage, and do nothing but spawn infinite amounts of Zombies, and Zombies with tumors. And can you kill them easily? NO. They only get damaged by magic, and magic is both not powerful, and not that useful. So, you will spend a few minutes trying to spam magic to kill him faster, while Zombies with tumors surround your ♥♥♥, and you have to choice but to kill everything. And everytime one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s appear, I end up farming enough XP to level up once. That's just being dumb. Maybe that's why I was so powerful at the end of the game, those guys kept appearing, and when I left the area, I had like 20 levels more...\n\nNow, leaving all that crap behind, what does the game do good?\n\nThe story, even though short, and a bit obvious at times (I saw the mayor plot-twists from a mile ago), it does get the job done, and it can get you hooked up for more. It goes arround "Dust", a young boy who has forgot about who he was, and seems to have been chosen by a talking sword. He, the sword, and Fidget, some sort of "cat-bat", then go in a long (or rather short) journey to find out who is Dust, what happend to him, and since were at it, save the world.\n\nThe combat system has some problems, mainly a lack in melee combos, but it's quite cool while it lasts. Casual players could understand them easily, and experienced players would love them. During the game you also get some new attacks, like the Storm, or magic for Fidget...Even though magic is kinda useless. You see, it's only prupose is to get huge combos. And what do you get from combos? More XP. Spamming magic like a casual gives you huge amounts of XP, like I've said before, and it ends up making the game easier, especially when you notice the huge range it has.\n\nThe soundtrack and voices are probably the highlights of the game. Even though I found Fidget a bit annoying at times, breaking the 4th wall without reason, the characters are well voiced, and the music fit perfectly.\n\nSomething I also liked about the game, are the "Friends" I mentioned before. What are them? Exploring a bit arround might lead you to find some sort of box (that seriously reminds me of the ones you would see in the first Rayman games...You know, THE GOOD ONES), and by using 4 keys, you can rescue a character from another indie game (or even two ducks that are supposed to be the guys who made the soundtrack). And not only that, finding these easter eggs gives you a permanent HP buff. Maybe I was also unstoppable because I found most of them without any problem, but the ways you find some of them sure are original. For the Fez character, you go into a messed up 2D style. For the guy from Braid, you summon a god-damn tornado, making a sick parody of the Tornado-crap from Castlevania Simon's Quest (Does somebody actually remember that game? Good old times), and then end in a dungeon where the soundtrack only continues whenever you're moving.\n\nThe game is, despite the amount of issues that make it look infinished, or at least unpolished, quite fun. I would not buy it for full price, but I do recommend it in a good sale. But still, Bastion is way better. Buy that instead if you haven't yet.","September 8, 2014","true","19.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Element921/recommended/236090/","Element921","Shinx Fucker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Element921/","111 products in account","This game is one of the most impressive games I've seen made by a single man. The main draw of the game for me was the combat system, but I ended up getting hooked by the story and exploration much more. The game is very reminiscent of old Metroid and Castlevania games, especially Metroid due to the fact that you will unlock new abilities through the game that can be used to access new areas in levels that you've already been to. There aren't an incredibly large amount of levels, but the levels still take a decent amount of time to get through and have plenty of secrets all over the place.\n\nBack to the combat system that I said interested me before, it is very satisfying but tends to get boring quickly. I found myself just repeating the same combo over and over since there was little reason to use much else. Also, I'd highly recommend playing sidequests rather than just rushing through the main story because enemies become VERY damage-spongey if you aren't properly leveled.\n\nNow, the story; I got quite hooked into the world this game created, despite it's somewhat childish appearance at first glance the story actually gets fairly dark at times while the writing still manages to have a good amount of humor(Mostly from your flying sidekick, Fidget). All the characters seemed well-written to me, except for the main character, Dust. Dust came off as an awfully generic reluctant hero, and what little character development he had seemed forced and out of nowhere. The voiceacting is also very good, aside from, again, Dust himself. I can't pinpoint exactly why, but Dust's voiceacting made me cringe often. A lot of people hate Fidget's voiceactor, but I found it well-done and fitting for the character.\n\nNow, one big complaint people have about this game is the artstyle. A lot of people don't like the sort of "furry" artstyle this game has, but personally, aside from Fidget, all the characters reminded me more of something you'd see in an old Disney cartoon than something you'd see in some lonely wolf-kin's DeviantART gallery. The artwork for the levels is also VERY detailed and well-done, and the animations are very impressive as well. Except for during the cutscenes, for some reason the pre-rendered cutscenes have AWFUL animation quality at times. There were a lot of cutscenes where I wished they had just stuck with the in-game dialogue and preset animations rather than a fully rendered cutscene.\n\nOverall, this game is absolutely fantastic, and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys those old Metroidvania-style games and people who enjoy a good story. Don't be turned away by the artstyle, I assure you there is no yiffing involved in this game. ...Just don't look up any fanart.","September 27, 2014","true","14.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Despite the fact that this says I love this game, I will acknowledge that it isn't perfect.  Let's get started, shall we?\n\nFirst things first, for those of you who are uneasy about the furry tag this game has, I can personally assure you that the characters in here are safe for all ages.  The worst you'll notice is some language, yet even this is used rather lightly –almost not at all.\n\nThe way the story is executed leaves me little to say in here without giving spoilers.  You play as Dust who has woken up in glade with no memory of who he is.  A talking sword called The Blade of Ahrah as well as the sword's little guardian, Fidget, accompany him on his journey of self-discovery.  Because of this kind of story, there is a lot of dialogue to go through.  Whether you can enjoy that or not I cannot determine.  Personally, I loved it.  All of the characters had personality, and it was well brought out with the voice actors hired.  The only exception to this, and this depends on your own perspective, would be Fidget.  Her squeaky voice and quirky personality will either be a hit or miss.  On a separated note, the only technical flaw was that the voice actors didn't use the same equipment.\n\nSo, on to the gameplay.  The majority of your attacks will be with the use of your sword.  Even though Fidget provides some ranged combat, it will end up feeling like a brawler.  The controls are very responsive.  The actually difficulty of this game may feel a bit low, and this is something I had to find out for myself during my second playthrough.  A wide variety of items are dropped by slayed enemies, some more common than others, but all have their uses for crafting augments (for Ahrah), armor, pendants, and rings –of which the last you can wear two.  These items can enhance, or in a few cases weaken, your attack, defense, luck (chance of a critical hit), and Fidget's power.  Overall, very solid.\n\nThe artistic side of this game is probably what can put this game above many others.  The artwork in here is stunning to say the least.  You might find yourself staring at anything and everything in this game.  It has all been hand-drawn by the one and only member of developer Humble Hearts, Dean Dodrill.  The soundtrack is likewise stellar.  Most tracks were created by the Northern Ireland duo Hyperduck Soundworks with a few others done by Funky Rustic, a.k.a. Alex Brandon.  The only times I felt the soundtrack was lacking was during the majority of boss fights, though even this is more so of my expectations.  I still listen to this game's soundtrack very often when I'm doing my weekly chores.  Challenging for me to find something I enjoy as much as this.\n\n\nThanks for reading.  If you have any questions/comments/critiques on this “review” of mine, feel free to share.  I will appreciate it.","July 23, 2014","true","54.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Dust, Ahrah and Fidget are the main protagonists of the game, Dust being the player.\n\nFidget acts as an assistant, and also a comic relief character, sometimes breaking the fourth wall (I hate fourth wall breaking, please don't do it, developers), and during combat she can use magic which synergizes with Duststorm, Dust's signature move (I think?)\n\nSince telling you the entire story would just spoil it, I will just tell you it has a good story, although rather short if you rush it.\n\nI do recommend you buying this game, but maybe in a sale for half its price, or at least for 7-9 euro. That's how much I would give it, in my opinion.","April 3, 2015","true","15.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","2"

The whole cutsy animated look isn't really something I'm used to so there's moments where I'm thinking "Wow that's really overly cutsy borderline furry"  lol  like the Figet character whos your sidekick in combat throughout the game, but the game has a very deep and rich story with a tremendous amount of voice over content.  There's a lot of talks with characters in the game and the way Dust doesn't remember anything makes for a very rich and engaging story where you are constantly discovering in pieces what hes about and what your purpose in the games story is.  It's the kind of deep story that most games lack now days.\n\nThe learn as you start playing way they teach the mechanics of the game is also very well done.  All of the little tutorial tips as I learned new moves actually displayed the name of the button that I had remapped certain actions to instead of a preset default key mapping.  I was glad to see that the game knew I'd changed primary and secondary fire and correctly displayed it when guiding me through, most games fall short with this but not Dust.  This game really has a very polished and good feel to it.\n\nThe combat is great hack and slash fun and the secondary fire with the ability to add in extra damage from Figets ability gives it some fun choices that work better for certain enemies.  Overall this is a definite must buy for anyone who likes a good hack and slash game.  Cutsy animation that some may hesitate at but if you want a taste of that hack and slash fun and the deep story I mentioned just watch the video trailer on the Steam Store page here and it's clear that this game is standing above most other games in its class.","December 27, 2014","true","7.7"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

You are accompanied by Fidget, a flying weasel-creature, and the blade of Ahrah, a sentient sword of typically quirky appearance.\n\nSending you on your way, the game amazingly avoids the "stupid tutorial", instead making the learning of all your skills part of the story. That in turn is delivered through dialogue between Dust and his new friends and any non-player characters (i.e. peasants) that give oddjob quests to keep you busy. Quests are pretty basic: "bring me my stuff from over there", "save my friend from monsters", "bring 5 goblin hides", but some are special or significant, along lines like "you are totally cursed" and "save video game characters", to mention a few trying to avoid spoilers. I'd like to emphasize that ALL of that is delivered through a spoken, animated dialogue. Especially I found it funny how Fidget lampshades your accomplishments and troubles by bragging and whining about them in many a dialogue.\n\nWhile strong in story, the gameplay and especially combat is the second important part of the game. You hack, slash and sweep through the air and enemy alike through all of the levels. Basic enemies, like goblins and zombies, are weak and at the mercy of the Dust Storm, my attack of choice that makes the enemies (and Dust himself) fly high in the air. Special enemies have special defenses and attacks, like having invulnerability frames, requiring parrying or using Fidget to make them vulnerable to attacks. Also, there are bosses every few hours. Combat doesn't even get boring after a while because despite repetitive it's always pretty awesome and there's that risk of getting hit and losing "chain".\n\nThat is at least the case on Hardcore difficulty level. Combat isn't that hard: if you know how to play and like to challenge yourself, I'd advice to pick the hardest difficulty level because then you actually have to avoid getting hit and combat becomes ruthless at times. I tried it on Casual level as well and I can pretty much guarantee it's easy enough for those of you who like to only experience the story.\n\nCartoony looks, the graphics are nice and well fleshed out. I especially liked how e.g. the map screen (level selection) has got several different scenes. E.g. sometimes Fidget is sleeping but she could also be eating marshmallows looking dreamy. I would also declare the game's various musical pieces to be spot on - there are no annoying ones either to my knowledge/preference.\n\nOn Hardcore difficulty getting all the achievements (well, except for one choice-based one) the game got me some 20 hours of adventuring, constant combats, puzzle solving and treasure hunting.

A modern classic, thoroughly humble in spite of its gorgeous presentation, it is a game that firmly stands among a gamer's fondest memories: Zelda, Metroid, Castlevania, Dust. But to say that this game is on the league of the classics from which it draws inspiration, is not enough. For Dust is, in many ways, better than any of those games, as it has learned and grown from them, not copied. Ocarina of Time, however wonderful our memories of it may be, is a game from the last century, and it shows. Not the case with Dust. This game runs in any resolution; it has hand-drawn high-resolution sprites; it is able of seamlessly changing between controller, keyboard and mouse inputs on the fly; it has charming and very well directed voice acting; great sound effects, graphic effects, cutscenes, dialogues, soundtrack. The technical details alone should be reason enough for you to try this game. Its wonders do not end there, however, for Dust is also a heart-touching story, unafraid of being naïve and juvenile, a fairy-tale in all the best ways — that manages to be mature where it counts. No wonder this is the work of a loving father: this is a game I'd raise my child with, confident that not only would he witness a great work of art, but that he would learn valuable lessons along the way.\n\nIf you are at all capable of enjoying platformers, give this game a try and allow it to enchant you.","January 14","true","14.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

If you liked a game like Shank 2 for instance, you should definitely play Dust : An Elysian Tail. It has a nice story and some RPG feature with quests and items to collect and craft. The best part is to get very big combos (over 1000). Moreover the graphics are sweet and it is a real pleasure to play through the game.\nHave fun!","December 30, 2013","true","21.3"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Firnen/recommended/236090/","Firnen","Firnen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Firnen/","67 products in account","So if you woke up in the middle of a land you’ve never been to and have no idea who you are? You’d probably wonder, but what if… you had a magical talking sword and a little companion who doesn’t know how to shut her mouth? You’d probably be confused or more the less, terrified. Yeah, welcome to Dust: an Elysian Tail.\n\nDust: an Elysian Tail is a 2-D indie fighting game that is good-looking, fun, and has a really fine story. First off and most importantly: the gameplay is really satisfying. The combat system in the game is original and unique in a way that you can rack up to 100+ combos in seconds. Rampage destruction on your enemies and take them out first before they take YOU out. Be warned for if you’re not careful in the battlefield, you will be taken out. The gameplay is distinctive like that so you’re not completely this invincible warrior taking people out with one swing like in most games. Of course, the common enemies you find here are quite easy to kill; but also quite dangerous when they start grouping up on you. At first the game lets a few slips here and there, but as it progresses, it gets more and more punishing for each little mistake. But when you push out and get over countless kills, it’s all-the-more satisfying. When you get to that boss and take him/her out, nothing has ever felt more satisfying. Though, from time to time, the game will push you to your limit and you must push though. It’s excruciating at times, but it is genuinely worth it.\n\nAs a reward for this, if you complete combos or take out a group of tough enemies, you will be given experience. The level-up system in the game is interesting for you can level up certain things every time you do so. So you can continue your path of terror. Like Skyrim, Dust: an Elysian Tail gives you that rare thing to be able to level up anywhere you want to, unlike most games where you have to level up certain things to be able to proceed correctly. Now, let’s move on to the graphics, where it’s about as good as the gameplay.\n\n… if not better.\n\nDust: an Elysian Tail has about the finest hand-painted world. Yes, you heard me, everything in this game was HAND MADE. This is mostly Dust’s strongpoint; the world, characters, and even down to the details in the menu are beautiful. The flora, the towns, the strongholds, and even that flow of lava that’s going to kill you in a few seconds, are all gorgeous. This amazing art-styled graphics are combined with anime-style characters; to add to that, they’re animals, furries if you will. Now I can already see some of you already turning away from the game. Personally, though, this doesn’t change anything at all. Personally it goes well with the overall game, makes the game’s visual presentation more effective. The story is also quite wonderful…\n\nNow, the story is about…\n\nHah, I got you there didn’t I? I’m not going to spoil it (or much of it). But I’ll say that the story is purely wonderful. It has the perfect blend of characterization, humor, and masterful storytelling. Just get the game; I will say it’ll be worth your time.\n\nDownsides?\n\nNot much, besides a few bugs and a few A.I. glitches. Sometimes the game can get irritating to get by, but overall not much going against it.\nSo just get Dust, it will be worth it.\n\nPersonal Gamer Score:\n9/10\n\nRecommend this game for those who want an awesome game with a good story, art/graphics, and an excellent game with good gameplay. But I may not recommend it for those who dislike anime-style graphics or sometimes time-to-time irritating gameplay.","December 15, 2013","true","23.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","2"

It's beautiful hand-drawn world that you are going to fall in love with.\nYou are playing as Dust, which is a boy that can't quite remember who he is or how he ended up where he is right now, shortly his swords begins to talk to him, but it's not going to reveal much. And after that, you are going to meet your sidekick fidget. She can be a bit annoying but it's a cute character that's making the game more interesting. She is not there just for the heck of it, she is a guardian of the sword your hero weilds and she decides to follow you if you are not going to retur the sword and in fact, she proves to be useful on your jurney.\n\nThe combat is flawless, fluid and responsive. Even tho there's alot to do, you'll be right at home with the mechanics. you are not only going to be killing stuff with your sword, you are going to learn some magic too and that's where fidget is going to proof useful to you. She cast it, you make it better. It's as simple as that.\n\nYou are going to be picking up some loot and coins alog the way, it's a RPG game after all complete with vendors and some crafting. While you can't craft yourself, you are going to meet a blacksmith, that's going to craft you whatever she can, you'll just have to find the resources and pay a fee. In the end, the gear can change how you play and what bonuses your character is going to have. You are also leveling up and each level you get to choose what stat are you going to increase.\n\nYou get quests as well as side quests and each is unique in its own way. I'd suggest you to complete every single one, it's worth your time. You can also find challanging places in the wrold. You have to complete certain challanges in them (run through an area fast and destroy all targets).\n\nThe story is easy to follow and yet it's great. You may think that you know who your character is after a while, but in the end it's all quite different and surprising. Each character have its own individuality, which makes it even better.\n\nThe music is one of the most important aspects of any game for me and here it's outstanding. I love the soundtrack, it's memorable and is making the game even better! I guarantee you are not going to be disapointed.\n\nI 100% the game and I would play it again, any time! It's full of nice references from other games that don't get in the way. It's working great with both a controller (it's ported from xbox after all) and keyboard. The PC port is one of the best ports out there, some major AAA devs could learn a thing or two (I am not kidding).\nIf you like platformers and you don't own this game yet, for the love of god get it! It's well worth the 14€","October 26, 2014","true","21.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

It has all the regular staples that can be attributed to furry culture and the fandom as a whole. Exceptionally good animation, and very lazy writing.\n\nWhen I say the animation is good I mean I could stare at some of the animation in this game and know I'd never be able to produce anything half as good in my lifetime. The character animations in this game are nothing short of magnificent. I am in awe of the visuals in this game. It stands out very well compared to it's competition.\n\nAt the same time what kills this game for me is it's terrible derivative plot. The plot to Dust: An Elysian Tail follows all the regular cliches. An amnesiac brooding hero, a plucky sidekick, a wise old mentor, a quest to save people etc. It's a story I have seen hundreds of times and it completely and utterly destroys my enthusiasm for this game. Had the designer taken the time to flesh out the story further, it really could have been up there with the greats like Symphony of the Night and Super Metroid.","February 19, 2014","true","1.3"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","2"

It is a lot easier if you counter and dodge properly, but it is by no means a requirment for doing well.\n\nThe story is the biggest part of the game. It's very well written and getting into the characters is not hard. It has a number of pretty light hearted moments, and I find muself cracking a smile every time Fidgit breaks the 4th wall. The character interaction between Fidgit and Dust is very enjoyable, which is good because you'll frequently find yourself caught up in a conversation based cutscene.\n\nLittle, but important, the menu allows a lot of customization. You can do everything from remap the buttons to resize and reposition your health bar display. It's such a small thing, but I'm amazed this sort of functionality isn't standard in every games options.\n\nMost of the characters in the game are anthropomorphic animals. If you have a problem with that, don't buy it. You'll need to save your money for a therapist to help you work out whatever issues you have that make you percieve things like Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse in only a sexual context. I mean, Christ people. Anthropomorphism has been a thing for THOUSANDS of years without people going "ewww yucky". If you're put off by that, you have a problem.","February 6, 2014","true","12.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

Both are soft and airy, but complete in their sound and aesthetic. In these elements the games childish nature is a benefit. The view is colored by imagination, the music dreamy.\n\nWhere the illustration felt inspired in the backdrops and visual effects, it fell short with character renderings. In this regard the game is rife with inconsistency. Where some character renderings seem polished, other renderings of the same character may seem like they were rushed. At their poorest the characters are drawn with little detail, in strange poses, out of proportion, and filled in with lazy coloring.\n\nThe aesthetic shortcomings can do harm to suspension of disbelief, which is already made vulnerable by cliche anime tropes and voice acting. The story is paced well, with a likeable protagonist, which helps to ease the parts which are harder to swallow. It's a mixed bag, where the delivery is sometimes charming and then overwhelmingly juvenile.\n\nWhile exploring Dust's beautiful landscapes you will find the odd puzzle sections, treasures, and map areas which are inaccessible without certain abilities - a la metroidvania. The mechanics are fluid and responsive. The sound effects and animations provide useful feedback to usher you through battles with hordes of enemies that provide a comfortable challenge.\n\nDust: An Elysian Tail is enchanting in large visual sections of the game, and so sets itself to disappoint with other elements. The gameplay and story are objectively servicable, but potentially polarizing among different players.\n\nI recommend you give it a try.","March 9, 2015","true","13.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","4"

As a huge indie game supporter, I am ecstatic to see games like Dust do so well. I'm not trying to hate on it, but I personally did not enjoy Dust. I will give my reasons:\n\nPros:\n+ The graphics are absolutely gorgeous. Easily one of the prettiest games I've ever played.\n+ The controls are very tight and feel good. There is no slipping. Very important for this type of gameplay. Good job here.\n+ I don't understand how a single person made this game. Major props because this game is very long compared to other titles which were made by one to two people.\n\nCons:\n- It's really important to connect with the characters in order to enjoy your time in the game. Unfortunately, the main character in this game has zero personality and I cringed every time he opened his mouth. He does transform in the end into someone with character and zeal but it took 8 hours for that to happen. For 90% of the game he is possibly the most boring protagonist I have ever witnessed. I understand his "beginning personality" was part of "who he is" but it made for an extremely boring character.\n- The combat is beyond oversimplified. You basically use the same two abilities over and over again. With the type of combat that exists in this game, I feel like some really cool intricate combos could have been created. Where is the strategy? Where is the strategic planning? Where are the ridiculous crazy combos?\n- The enemies for the first 80% of the game are also oversimplified and unimaginative. You can use the same strategy for almost every enemy you encounter barring a select few with specific abilities.\n- The item choices are so bland. There are almost no "choices" you have to make between items. 95% of the time, they simply just become better and better. They have no tradeoffs. This causes the game to become very linear and simplified.\n- The storyline was... borderline acceptable at best. I felt like so much effort was put into the end of the game that the entire 90% of the rest game was just left out. The ending was good. I liked the ending. Nothing happens though for the entire rest of the game.\n\nOverall, Dust is very beautiful visually, and I enjoyed the message at the end. Unfortunately, Dust feels like a shell that was never fully developed and lacks depth. The characters are bland, the combat is oversimplified, and the item choices are made for you due to having very little tradeoffs.\n\nDust takes about 8 hours to complete.\n\n5/10","November 8, 2014","false","7.8"," 159 of 297 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","159","297","5","12"

I would, however, call it a mediocre game for someone like me. I want to explain my criticisms of this game, and I want to emphasize that there are people to whom I would recommend this game, and I will expand on that point at the end.\n\nMy main criticisms of this game are:\n\nStoryI recognize that this criticism is mostly personal preference, but I found the story good by video game standards but not movie or book standards, which is not saying much. In addition, I felt that the story took a left turn in Act III that was not built up to much at all, but the characters acted like it had been foreshadowed all along, which was kind of annoying.\n\nCombatThe combat system is acceptable but not great. It’s mostly button-mashing and there’s not a lot of variety in the moves you can perform, so by the end of the game, the combat will feel quite repetitive. There are ways to counter enemy attacks and other special moves, but when enemies fill the screen (as they often do), it’s very difficult to see when enemies are attacking, which often makes button-mashing the most effective strategy.\n\nRPG SystemI would only consider this game an RPG in the loosest sense. The RPG system in this game boils down to “you get stronger as the game progresses.” There are no interesting choices to make regarding your stats or playstyle. As you level up your stats, the game forces you to keep them roughly equal, and you’ll eventually be able to max out on everything anyway.\n\nDifficultyThe game has a difficulty selection screen at the beginning, which is not a great way of setting difficulty in general. Fundamentally, the game does not play well on higher difficulties. As I said before, it can be hard to see when enemies are attacking, so you’ll often be hit without much warning. On higher difficulties, in which enemies do more damage, this can lead to quick deaths out of nowhere. Movement is very loose, which means that you can die repeatedly without it ever feeling like your fault. Ultimately, any difficulty in this game feels frustrating rather than rewarding.\n\nConclusionMy criticisms above are more than enough for me to give this game a thumbs-down. However, “Dust: An Elysian Tail” certainly has numerous redeeming qualities. The artwork and voice acting are great, and I can’t say that there’s anything wrong on the technical side of this game.\n\nI would recommend this game to people who plan on playing it for the story and artwork, and I would definitely recommend playing on the lower difficulty levels. If you consider yourself more of a “hardcore” gamer, I suggest passing on this game in favor of a different 2D metroidvania game.","April 2, 2015","false","15.9"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","20","33","0","0"

Even without the context, this is a very well made game with lots of polish. This game is full of quality visuals and animation.\n\nIn terms of writing, the game is weak: characters are shallow, serious dialogue can you make you cringe and the story falls flat. Some of the humor worked well, but it is the serious moments that the game struggles with. Maybe I was not the target audience, which would be fine, but the game tries so hard to focus on narrative that I felt like I should mention that the story and characters are average at best.\n\nThere are a few different buttons for combat and lots of repetition. There are a handful of combos and powers you can use, but you can really just get away with button mashing for most enemies, which is a shame because the combat is smooth. What's worse than repetitive combat is how much you will have to do it as enemies respawn every time you return to an area and sometimes you can't leave until you beat them.  I think the problem is that your character can easily just zip around destroying everything in sight, and it makes for stale  combat. Playing on the harder modes did offer some challenge for certain parts (read: the first 2 minutes of gameplay), but mostly I was death incarnate, which is incredibly dull. Personally, I am fine with plain combat (like most of the Castlevanias). This game tried to do something a bit different, I just wish it was executed better. (this could just be preference because I enjoyed Guacamelee and Valdis Story.)\n\nThere are some light RPG elements, but really there are just some generic stats you can increase when you level up and a few points in certain areas turns you into an unstoppable whirlwind of destruction. The exploration felt like a nice slice of metroidvania. I also liked some of the cryptic notes that help find secrets, and some of the references and cameos were neat (the Castlevania one in particular is pretty elaborate). However I found the platforming to be a bit lukewarm:sometimes the controls didn't feel as response, but some sections played well. I also found that Dust had Assassin's Creed's flaw in terms of economy: the game leaves you too rich to really care. There is also a crafting system but it just falls in with the economy's folly.\n\nBasically the game has fast paced combat that grows old quick and has too much fluff, offers little challenge, and focuses on it's weaker aspects (platforming and story). This game is certainly good looking and polished, but the story, combat, and characters do drag the game down quite a bit.\n\nIt's a flawed and stylish game, but by no means extremely awful. I wish there was a way to offer a neutral response. I didn't hate it, but I only enjoyed parts of it at certain times. Mostly it was just bland, but functional. I only listed this as a positive review because people seemed to not handle a negative responses too well. Replaying it on harder mode and going further past %100 help me appreciate some of the finer parts of the game, but I still wish it didn't try to tell a serious story; it does humor better.","August 2, 2013","true","7.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","3"

The art style is just amazing and the game looks and feels really smooth. Combined with good controls the combat is brilliant and fun, and does not leave much to be desired. (Except for maybe a few more combos?)\n\nThe world is filled with secrets, and as the game goes on you acquire new powers. These powers help you get to treasures in areas you have already explored. This makes for some backtracking, but because of the beautiful world and fun gameplay it did not bother me at all. The treasures are also quiet rewarding. Giving you food, equipment or even items for crafting. Each time you level up you also get 1 stat point which can be used too boost your stats the way you want.\n\nThe story is entertaining and its succeeds in getting you exited wondering about what is going to happen or all the questions you twist your brain around. The voice acting is one of the best i have listened to in a while and gives all the characters stand forth as individuals with feelings and different personalities. So doing side quests for them does not feel generic at all and is a good way to enjoy the full extent of the whole world.\n\nAll in all it is a brilliant game with very few, if not none, flaws. Its very replay able and it is grown to be one of the games i set highest on my list.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freyar/recommended/236090/","freyar","Freyar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freyar/","1188 products in account","Originally released for the Xbox 360, Dust: An Elysian Tail is proof that ports can be done near-perfectly if you just pay enough attention and respect to the material. The port to the PC side of things is so impressive, it blows other studios out of the water, beating out large developers and publishers like Activision and in some cases even EA.\n\nDust: An Elysian Tail is beautiful in all its artwork. Visually unique, stunning, and well crafted. With unique characters all designed and drawn by one person, Dust AET really showed the focus and talent that Dean Dodrill has. While voicework, soundtrack and a few other aspects were done by contract, it was all pulled together by one person and that makes this even more impressive.\n\nCombat is tight, quick, and avoids the pitfalls that cause most brawlers to fail in my eyes. I don't have to feel like I'm spamming buttons to do what I want to do, instead there's a weight to actions that give a clear cause-and-effect between button presses and combinations that provides for a better sense of play. The RPG aspects of the game allow for a level of customization which also is an added benefit to replayability.\n\nThe soundtrack, contracted through Hyperduck Soundworks is nothing short of impressive. While previous offerings by Hyperduck didn't particularly impress me (mostly in part due to the game they were designed for didn't catch my attention), Dust:AET's soundtrack is one that grabbed me from the title menu all the way through. Tracks compliment not only environment, but the overall "goal" for passing an area. Large sweeps of various instruments while keeping a higher tempo help build an urge to get through zones in open environments.  Heavier claustrophobic tracks help reinforce the underground nature of various caverns and all the tracks push you to want to see what is on the next screen.\n\nYou would be excused if you weren't sure Dust: AET was a native game for the PC. Extensive PC options for video, audio, and controls are something that even massive publishers fail to do are all present but it even has options to customize the size of the UI as well as position. The game plays well with keyboard and mouse (though admittedly I preferred to play with a controller, having the best of both worlds makes the PC an excellent platform), and it even scales extremely well for slower PCs and laptops.\n\nThis is a great platformer, and if you're looking for one that is technically competent, an excellent experience, and one that manages to strike that chord that most art pieces try so hard to do then Dust:AET is a game you simply must get and play. Whatever you do, make sure you have either excellent speakers, or headphones. Audio design is just that great.","March 28, 2014","true","10.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

It features stunning graphics, a perfectly blended score and voice acting far superior to most games I've played in my whole life (really, in my case that means something, gaming since the glorious CBM 64 times!).\n\nThe game is so well crafted you could easily find yourself lost in playing it for only enjoying the fabulous scenery. In fact it is so damn good the game could easily feature the Disney logo in front and it would be an honour for the company that brought to us so many lovely and memorable movies (and I'm quite sure it would be an honour for the developer to ... ;).\n\nThere is love and workmansship squeezing out of every detail of the setting and aspect of the game. The only letdown is that it's relatively easy, so don't expect something like a Castlevania or Metroid out of it gameplaywise, but keep in mind that this very game here was made merely by one person only during a period of four years devoting all his developing skills to just this one game. And you don't get to see things like this happen very often these days anymore. For 20 years now I always thought that this is a good sign for quality in games and seeing this game now is the proof that my believe is right.\n\nAnd the gameplay ... omg the gameplay ... To say it in one word it's gorgeos. You can control the game perfectly with whatever input device you throw at it. The player and the enemy animations plus the scrolling are fluid like golden butter in the mildness of a sunny summer's evening driping from a bunch of freshly cutted bread.\n\nFor my part I even enjoy the story very much. I can't understand the complains of some of the other reviewers. For a game like this it is absolutely fullfilling all of my deeds I have to a decent action platformer with RPG-elements like Dust is. You got the whole pack here: Tragedy, Revenge, Mystery and Suspense. And that's only the main story line. On top of that there are many sidequests offered by various NPCs from within the games different locations. And the NPCs are so well and lovely implemented in the game, with so much heart that has been put into their design you will have no other choice but to help 'em out.\n\nFor me this game is one of the best games I've played for a few years now. The only concern I have about it is that it has an end, and like with everything as good as Dust it will most likely come too soon ... But what the heck ... at least you've got two more difficulty settings if you played it through on normal. And for the not so pro-players amongst us, there is even a Casual difficulty setting so that really every single player can enjoy this game independently from what their gaming skills might be.\n\nIf you enjoyed games like Aztaka you should absolutely get this.\n\nIf you played this game through and want some more you should probably get Aztaka ... :)\n\nI got my copy of the game on a discount sale but I'd say it's easily worth even the full price.","April 26, 2014","true","36.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The gameplay shines as extremely fast paced. You earn experience by chaining up huge combos, ensuring a continual stream of hacking, slashing and causing explosions to fly around the screen. One thing to note is that you may want to consider using a controller rather than a keyboard.\n\nSadly, the game's storyline is pretty weak and left a lot to be desired - You play as Dust, the mysterious hero who wakes up with (DUN DUN DUUNNNNN) amnesia and ends up finding himself on a quest to save the Moonblood (AKA, reptile) race from genocide at the hands of General Gaius and his legion of racist mammals, learning your destiny and true nature along the way and blah blah blah... it's pretty standard generic fare, and in my opinion, left a lot of important details unspoken that I REALLY wish would have been expanded on. It also creeped me out a bit how oddly sympathetic General Gaius was portrayed despite basically being lizard Hitler. Despite all that, the characters are pretty likable and full of personality, and the voice acting is well done.\n\nVisuals are the other area where this game really shines aside from gameplay. Almost all of the graphics are hand drawn, with the exception of water renderings and Dust's sword (which admittedly causes an odd juxtaposition with his hand-drawn sprites). The locations, although generic (forest level, cave level, snow level, lava level etc), are all beautifully illustrated and provide gorgeous eyecandy.\n\nIf you can forgive the weak story in lieu of the strong gameplay, then I highly recomend Dust: An Elysian Tail","April 3, 2014","true","66.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

A lot of other areas are optional and require coming back with upgraded or new skills to explore.\n\nThe only negative side I can think of is - it's too short. 10 hours into the game, I'm at 75% of storyline and about 80% explored everything.\n\nWould definitely recommend.","August 13, 2014","true","10.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The combat is fun, and this game really should be played with a controller. The references to other indie games was neat, and unlocking them was crazy satisfying. The soundtrack was also great. I gotta say though, the knockback distance is really ridiculous, and often irritating. You also have to backtrack a lot, which is something I dont mind, but not everyone out there likes that kinda thing.  The voice acting was a little bit over the top, and personally, the character designs, personalities and art style doesnt really float my boat.

The game engine runs smoothly and the graphics are awesome, they're filled with colorful maps, characters and enemies.\nThe plot and the storyline are good, it's filled with well-made characters with good voices and different personalities, the main character itself is epic.\nI enjoyed the soundtrack very much and it is well fitted with the situations, with the scenes and with the different areas of the map.\nI liked the puzzles and side-quests too, they can take you some time away because they're not easy to understand, you must explore the map and understand exactly what you must to do to make your way to the game ending.\nThe only thing that i feel a little bad about is that once you finish the game and the side quests hardly you will play this again because it hasn't a high replay value, you're not going to feel at the same way of your first time on this game.\n\nIn the end it's a game that is worth to buy and play.

I can spend many hours looking at the characters and background, Dean make a really great game, I love it.\n\nBut the game is very short, bosses are easy to beat (even the General Gaius, last of them) and battles with monsters eventually makes you bored (monsters respawn, when you get back at the section of level).\n\nMy verdict: if you like side-scrollers, furries and want to play as a character with amnesia, this game is your choise!

Beautiful hand-drawn art, visuals and animations, fantastic soundtrack and voice acting, as well as characters and story. Combat is fluid with every button press and sword swing.\nYour main character, Dust, is an energetic, humorous furry warrior who (like in many games) lost his memory and goes on a quest to find out who he actually is. On this quest he is acompanied by Blade of Ahrah (a talking blade, yes) and Blades diminutive guardian Fidget which makes for a lot of fun throughout the game. Story is beautifuly written and both main and side quests offer you hours and hours of playing without getting bored. Combat style is as many would say is "easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master" type with usually dozens of enemies on the screen and with many possibilities and tricks makes for a very good combat system.\nThere are some cons here and there like enemies and bosses being very easy early in game (but they get a lot harder in later parts of game and make for formidable opponents), some items being overly expensive early on and as much as Dust have nice moves and attacks, few more combos or attacks would always be nice.\nAll in all, Dust: An Elysian Tail is everything you could want in an action rpg, and it is one of my most favorite games of all time.\nI would highly recommend this game not only to RPG fans, but to all gamers out there to atleast give it a try.\nMy score for this game is 9.5/10 and I have enjoyed it from beginning to very end and so will you :D","February 25, 2014","true","48.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Add that with magic abilities from your furry pal and you can own most of the game. You can upgrade all your equipments except your sword. Why? Well, you`ve gotta play it for yourself to know. The constant changing of environment keeps the game fresh and exciting. The platforming were great and not too difficult. The graphics and visuals reminds me of Okami (in some sense) although the mechanics are completely different. Every character in this game has a life. By that I mean that each of them has a distinct characteristic in them, the pride of a artist, the affection of one to another, the hatred of other races and so on.\n\nHowever, the lack of varieties in your ways of attacking makes it a bit dull. Often at times I found myself mashing the same button to clear waves after waves of enemies. Save points are sometimes scarce and you`ll be praying one appears in front of you before you get KO-ed and restart from way back. The boss battles are quite disappointing though, constanly being exploited by me lol. Unlike any other games, this game doesn`t have any replay value. It doesn`t even give you the chance to explore after endgame.\n\nAlthough this game certainly had some flaws. I really still enjoyed it :)\n\n8/10","February 22, 2014","true","17.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The drawn graphics are even more beautiful than Rayman Legends.\n\nThe music is wonderful. HyperDuck Studios did a very good job at creating those long, varied tracks. The voice acting is good, not the best out there but good.\n\nThe game is a mix of action, platforming and RPG and it works really well. The combat is quite simple, but fun. The exploration is fun too. There are quite a few sidequests as well. The gameplay works really well, and the fact it was programmed by a single person is simply impressive.\n\nThe story is enjoyable and quite well-written. The character are likeable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/236090/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","Honestly, I'm not sure why I'm even bothering to write a review of Dust: An Elysian Tail.\nEverybody already knows that this game is awesome. Tens of thousands of reviews have been posted. I believe that everything that needs to be said about the game, has probably already been said. Furthermore, I can't make up a bunch of complaints and flat-out lie, just so I can be "Mr. Contrarian". If were to present an argument that Dust isn't really all that great, first I'd have to convince myself, and that isn't happening.\n\nWhy do I think Dust is great? It's mainly due to the controls and level-design. If you've played this game, then you're well-aware of the protagonist's abilities, particuarly his uh... tornado spin?(Press Y button while in mid-air*). This move homes in on enemies, and can even cause Dust to be launched miles into the air, if he's aiming for a flying enemy. A neat trick is using a Lightning storm, then following with the tornado, as enemies are lifted into the air by the electricity. There's a certain joy to be found in soaring through the sky, even when there isn't an incentive (such as treasure).\n\nAt the same time, Dust's ability to practically fly isn't a hindrance to the level-design. There are a few shortcuts, and maybe even a sequence break or two, but there's nothing that comes off as really awkward. Due to Dust's mobility, he doesn't really work in a pixel-precise-platformer. Thus, all of the platforms in this game - moving or otherwise - are wide enough. I'd say that on average, they're more than two "Dusts" in width.\n\nNow hang on a second. How does one measure "Dusts"? In platformers, it's always important to consider the character and their relationship with the world. Take Super Mario Bros. 1 for example. The smallest block in SMB1 is only slightly wider than Mario. This gives players just enough time to react, but they don't have to constantly measure their jumps. Having to adjust your landing for every single jump not only affects the pacing of the game, but it also becomes tiring for the player. Another example is the first Sonic the Hedgehog game. Sonic is a faster character, so the platforms he lands on tend to be twice as wide as he is. There's more that could be said here, but it would all be irrelevant to this review of Dust: An Elysian Tail. In short, platforming in this game works, because the player has enough freedom to move around.\n\nThe combat also benefits from all of the mobility. There are many tools to play around, and even if they're at times unnecessary, they're still appreciated. If a player wants to tornado through all of the enemies while tossing storms everywhere, that's fine. They can just as easily stay on the ground, and decimate everything with the sword alone. Switching between multiple styles is seamless, and it works wonderfully.\n\nOh and if you haven't noticed this before. In the final area, if you perform an air-grab on the flying ships, the game pauses for a suitably epic second. The game doesn't do this for any of the other enemies (even the final boss), and that's really cool.\n\nOther than that... Well, I'm afraid I don't have anything else to add. This is a superb game, but you already know that.","May 30","true","13.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/236090/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","Dust is a 2D action-exploration game in the famed 'Metroidvania' style, with some pretty cool elements to it. It actually reminds me a lot of "Muramasa: The Demon Blade" (if you've ever played or heard of that). As with Muramasa, the first thing you will notice are the stunning hand-drawn visuals and animation. The look of the characters and backgrounds during gameplay are quite beautiful. Additionally, the characters all have detailed animated portraits that appear on-screen during conversations. It just looks fantastic all around. The characters themselves are all pretty good, assuming you can stomach a cast full of anthropomorphic animals (and a seriously cutesy flying bunny-type-thing sidekick). The voice acting and plot are generally good as well. Gameplay consists of 2D sword combat with light platforming elements. The combat also has a few cool twists - your sidekick has projectile attacks that can be combined with a special sword technique, resulting in some spectacular combos and on-screen fireworks. It all looks and feels really cool once you get the hang of it. Eventually you will become just  ridiculously powerful, making the game very easy, but it's still good fun. As with similar games, you progress through various areas that unlock as you gain additional abilities. There's also a ton of extra stuff to do (such as side-quests), if you are into 100%-ing games or completing achievements. If you are a fan of this type of game, this one is well worth your time. Highly recommended. A-\n\nTechnical notes: I highly recommend using an Xbox360 controller for this one. Although I haven't actually tried the keyboard controls, I just can't imagine them working well enough to easily pull off the actions required by the game. Plus, these types of games just control better with gamepads anyways. Anyways, just be aware of this... you've officially been warned.","July 12, 2013","true","22.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Thankfully, things caught up quickly and soon I found myself lost in the world of Dust.\n\nThe artworks and soundtracks used in this game are top-notch from the start to the end. I thoroughly enjoyed the aesthetical aspects of the game and I applaud the developers for putting their efforts. The story as a whole was excellent and the characters are among one of the best written ones I've seen.\n\nYou'd need to play this with a gamepad though as playing on a keyboard may not be ideal in numerous fights and can give a different (or perhaps  a less enoyable) experience as a result. Anyway, there is also a pretty good variety of combat skills to choose from and you will be able to use them in various situations such as searching for treasures or going against different enemies. It's a rather big world out there so do try to explore all parts of the map.\n\nThe only negative I could think of were the lags during the cutscenes. I've already experienced it twice during my playthrough and I had to reload a save and complete the level/fights again to watch the cutscene once more. Not a potential game-breaker but they can be annoying.\n\nIn a nutshell, I highly recommend people to try this game out. I got it during the sale so it was definitely worth the money. However, even without any discounts, its price is still rather acceptable for a game of its calibre. An amazing game that will give you a whole lot to think about when you play it.\n\nAshes to ashes, dust to dust!","January 6","true","24.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

If you're looking for the game as such with fair pricing then this is a good one for you.\n\nPlaying the game from the start to finish is truly a rewarding experience. The story writer knew how to make an engaging background history, to implementing the plot through the game progression (and of course having full voice cast and interesting character developments). And I gotta say, the voice actors did make a wonderful job. They could show that a voice can deliver strong emotion throughout the game. Moreover, the ending truly was well written, and a strong point to playing Dust: AET until the finish.\n\nGraphic is is is,.... bad... for furry chars and cartoon haters. Ha. Well no, I'm kidding, the graphic is an incredible touch. I love how they designed the levels and the characters. Dust is cool and tough, Fidget is irritating when she starts to whine but she's especially endearing to see. The animation overall and the level designs are flat out gorgeous, full with lightnings in battle and vibrant colors.\n\nGameplay, though, is a bit too easy and repetitive. Being an 'easy' side scroller platformer, you literally can overwhelm enemies with Fidget + Arrah's combos and that's all you need to win thru the levels. That's with the hardest difficulty btw. Bosses can be a bit tough, but unlike we have seen on other platformers. Once you know how to block and spam the combos, the game's piece of cake. A bit skill is required when playing the challenges - but it's a sidequest anyway.\n\nOther Side Quests, sadly, don't offer much added value. There are maybe 20 or so, but none of them are memorable for me. Mainly just give you some small rewards and a joy knowing you've completed what the game has to offer.\n\nThere's a small RPG element - mainly you can level up Dust (and get him extra HP/stats) and equip armors on him. Blade is not replaceable - you can only arm Arrah, the rest is replaceable. Not much I can say, it's kinda shallow mechanic as there's not enough varieties on armors to make it interesting. Just equip the best ones and you're set.\n\nAs always, playing with xinput based controller for all Microsoft-related games is recommended. The button mappings feel natural, so there's no need to mess around.\n\nGame length is a bit short for my preference - only about 10-15 hours even for completionist. Being short, and of course the major lacking point is replayability.\n\nMy recommendation would be to pick this game up. Can't go wrong playing Dust - it's one of great indie games that everyone must play.","December 28, 2013","true","8.5"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

The voice acting in this game was... not enjoyable. It feels like a less than good dubbed anime.\nIt's not enjoyable.  But it's forgivable. It's not a grand terrible voice acting but it feel cringy to listen to at times. Not enough to make it mute the game anytime people open their mouth.\n\nThis game gets   8 furries out of enjoying a postage card.","June 28, 2014","true","11.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spi/recommended/236090/","spi","Spi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spi/","194 products in account","Итоговая оценка - 4,43/5\nБолее подробный разбор ниже.\n\nКогда небо было голубее и трава зеленее, мы играли в классические нынче платформеры. Эта игра перенесла меня туда, и я вспомнил, что меня "цепляло" - всё было интересно и в новизну. Проработанные и красиво нарисованные локации населенные, такой же, проработанной и красивой фауной. И да локации весьма разнообразны: от зелёных лугов с разрушенными остатками былой цивилизации и тёмного подземелья, до заснеженных горных вершин и вулканических земель - всё очень ярко и запоминающееся.\n\nПо всем канонам платфомеров присутствуют и секретные локации, на которые попасть не всегда просто и очевидно. Если для некоторых просто необходимо пройти дальше по сюжету и получить новую способность (да тут способности будут выдаваться по мере прохождения сюжета, но об этом дальше), то для других нужно воспользоваться как чьими-то записями или же просто интуицией. Когда Вам в последний раз хотелось пройти игру открыв все секреты и локации? Я уже давненько не помню такого. Именно это отпечаталось у меня в голове после полного прохождения данной игры. Ибо автору удалось облегчить поиск секретов ровно на столько, что бы это оставалось интересным, но не вызывало мучений.\n\nБоевая система же в игре сделана, по-моему мнению, в угоду возрасту игрока (рейтинг 10+), без наличия рек крови, но вполне интересную на высоких уровнях сложности. Среди обзоров наткнулся на фразу о том, что все бои проходят за одной, изредка двумя кнопками. Странно видеть такие замечания к слешеру, коим по-сути и является этот платформер в боевой части. На самом же деле в игре присутствует парочка комбо, но действительно хотелось бы больше комбинаций т.к. со временем эффектная анимация приедается и становится немного скучно. Скуку помогает разбавить сложность, т.к. протагониста могут положить на лопатки всего несколько ударов, а так же наличие нескольких нетипичных врагов, к которым необходим особый подход.\n\nТак же присутствует и РПГ-составляющая: система уровней с прокачкой одной из характеристик, которых 4 (на самом деле их 5, но прокачивать можно только 4) и которые не могут разниться между собой не более чем на 4 очка; а также система экипировки персонажа артефактами которые влияют на все 5 характеристик и еще несколько игровых моментов.\n\nКак платформер игра не так хардкорна, как тот же Mario, Darkwing Duck, но на некоторых местах заставляет изрядно понервничать и сжать контроллер покрепче. Да я сказал контроллер, игра пришла к нам на ПК-платформу прямиком с Xbox360 и изначально была "заточена" под геймпад и в процессе игры ни разу не хотелось пересесть за клавиатуру. Ну да ладно, вернемся к самой игре. Чтобы собрать все секреты необходимо открыть все способности протагониста, поэтому придется возвращаться вновь на локации. Кстати, после зачистки локации, враги появляются вновь стоит только выйти за её границу. Это сложно отнести к явным недостаткам, но создает некоторое неудобство, которое по мере прокачки протагониста будет всё меньше и меньше.\n\nИ наконец сюжет. Он имеет как излишнюю пафосность и какой-то детской наигранностью, так интригующую составляющую (сюжет не по книге/фильму/игре, а свой собственный, хотя и имеет в себе парочку-другую штампов) и юмор, который действительно способен вызвать улыбку. Но всё же он сделан , по моему мнению, опять же в угоду возраста игрока.\n\nP.S. Игра проходится за 8-12 часов. Я же столько наиграл банально из-за низкого уровня знания английского - что заставляло меня перманентно держать в оверлее гугл-переводчик (хотелось просто подтянуть уровень английского, а происходящее было вполне интересено, чтобы не отбивать желания понимать происходящее).\n\nP.P.S. Кстати интересный факт, что над игрой работал по-большей части один человек около трёх с половиной лет. Я думаю это и помогло стать игре такой какой она задумывалась...","January 8, 2014","true","42.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not only the character but the game as a whole.\nDust as a character is a young man struggling with his past, present and future. He wakes up not being able to remember who he is or how he got there, thus starting a journey in the search of those lost memories. Sounds quite cliche, but it has been fabulously executed, exceeding my story-related expectatives.\nDust as a game is impressive. The story is simple but deep, everything you do and everyone you meet have something to do in this game, the backgrounds and BGM are breathtaking and the gameplay is intuitive and absolutely great. Even the english dubbing has been properly done. The various side quests it includes (Cirelian Trials, secondary missions, finding treasures and friend cages, finding materials for building your own equipment, etc) add up to the game experience.\nA must-play game.

(In fact in you regularly play platformers with mouse and keyboard then you're probably fine.)\n\nOverall though, the game is really awesome and fun to play. There's plenty of exploring you can do if you want to find all the treasures in this game (it's definitely worth finding the hidden friends for health bonuses). The backtracking for items may annoy some people but I always found it a great oppurtunity to level grind. While it probably helps to do so, the bosses are typically pretty easy so that you don't have to grind. I played on Normal mode and the game was easy enough that I didn't get too frustrated but not so easy that I felt bored. (I plan on trying the harder modes next). Game has a ton of replayability with skippable cutscenes so if you're not into watching them more than once, hooray for you!\n\nOverall I really recommend everyone at least give this game a try, especially if you like platformers or games that you can explore.","July 4, 2014","true","20.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenEarth/recommended/236090/","GreenEarth","♥Tide♬|trade.tf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenEarth/","61 products in account","So after 2 and a half years of development, we'd finally get this game: Dust: An Elysian tail.\n\nAnd please tell me if you get the gabe newell reference, but this game was worth the wait in every way.\n\nThroughout the game, i'd search for plotholes and flawed gameplay mechanics, and needsly to say, i couldn't find any.\nDust's controls are the opposite of stiff. The game is really responsive to controls, and it leads to some fun platforming and fast-paced gameplay. And while this game does have a rush bros disease of slow walking and fast rolling, I had an easy time ignoring it to the game's combat.\n\nNot only are you given a however small variety of attacks to dish out pain with, there's loads of combos that you can test yourself to execute and memorize with your keyboard, and you get rewarded for each combo. Not only do you get extra experience, you also get achivements, and your enemies of course die faster. While that does sum it up, this game also has its way of disapointment.\nAt the beginning of the game, you're given the blade of Ahrah, Fidget, And dus'ts glorious control to utilize and THATS. IT.\nLater in the game, you're informed ahrah is only ONE of the blades of elysium; Why couldnt we find and use the others? I wouldve liked more variety than just being stuck with 2 weapons to use. Fidget got more than one mode of attacking, why cant we?\n\nGameplay aside, the graphics, which are hand drawn by the way look GLORIOUS. They dont cause any eyestrain and there isnt a spam of color palette like rush bros had. The game is really pretty to look at and i hope you buy it for that reason.\n\nNow, lets go to the plot. In the beginning you see an unknown warrior charging through a variety of people for an unknown reason, and later find out he's killed by a child. In the next scene, you see our main character, dust, kneeling in the middle of an unknown forest. This is the game's first point of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off. You know why? THERES NO REAL CUTSCENES UNTIL NEAR THE END OF THE GAME. Otherwise, all you get is pictures that might as well mimic a slideshow along with text, it really made me depressed toward how such good artwork was put to waste. Anyway, we're introduced to our 3 protagonists, dust, fidget, and the blade of ahrah, which as i said earlier is the main weapon you'll be using throughout the game. We then see that dust has forgotten his past and that he summoned ahrah for yet another unknown reason. Dust doesnt even know why he did it, but he chooses to ignore it and go on a quest to find out more of his past, kill a bunch of racist knights, and simply bring justice where justice is needed with the help of fidget and the blade of ahrah.\nThis is why i like indie games like this, they keep the plot simple and fast to keep the player wanting to play their game. You might call it lazy, but it works.\n\nSo after all that said, I do like this game for a variety of reasons, (One i'd rather not say) And also, I think that this game has perfect potential and setup for a sequel. If there were a game called Dust 2 (No pun intended), I really hope they'd keep what made this game good and add onto it.","May 31, 2014","true","18.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

It has the feel of a professionally made game by a well known team. If you enjoy action rpg in somewhat of the style of "Metroidvania" Castlevania game, then this game is for you. If you act now(at the time that I'm typing this), you can get the game for only 3 dollars. It is a steal for how well made this game is. Plenty of action, material to collect to make new items, quests to do for npcs, etc.\n\nThe only issue I've had so far was the game crashing on me upon going to the world map to chose a new area to go to. It doesn't always happen. I suspect it will be resolved at some point, and it isn't too gamebreaking, as long as you save often. I am thorough pleased with my purchase of this game, and I highly recommend it to anyone else that enjoys these type of games.\n\nEdit: It should be noted that the crashes on world map only happened the first two times I tried to go on it. It has been fine after that, So it was probably just my comp, since I was on it for a while.\n\nEdit2: Having finished the game, I may have some minor nitpicks, but nothing major. Mostly the artwork in the final scenes looked odd with the eyebrows and eyes going through the hair. It makes it look out of place, compared to how professional everything else looked. Other than that, this game has been really solid all the way through.\n\nTouching story, and leaving the door open for a sequel. I've had a blast, and I still gotta play this game through again on a harder setting at some point and finish up what is left of the achievements. I probably would have paid the original price.

A straightforward, side-scrolling platformer with simple button-mashing combo-style hack n' slash combat, pretty graphics, and a relatively interesting storyline. It's got a very stereotypical anime-esque appearance, but there's beauty in the simplicity of the game. It's extremely well developed, easy to pick up and play, and nicely eyecatching. The animation is wonderfully smooth, with very subtle background effects, and a wide variety of environments to move through as you open up more of the wider map.\n\nI tend to think of this game as being a bit simple, but it's a work of art and it's hard to believe that it was entirely the product of one person. It must have been a labour of love, and that effort shows through. Dust is an interesting character and, almost despite myself, I became engrossed in his story and the way in which it unfolded. I was expecting something very basic and repetitive as this is a 2D platformer I bought during the sale, mainly because I'm a sucker for pretty artwork in games. I didn't expect much beyond a couple of hours of simple gameplay and levelling up a few times before polishing off a boss and ending the game all in time for tea.\n\nA week later, after running through the game twice (I upped the difficulty level the second time around) and earning all of the achievements, proved me totally wrong. At first I was skeptical; I found the characters to be a little bit twee and stereotypical, but as they and the story line developed I got hooked. It's suitable for all ages so don't expect any gore or adult themes, but there's a certain appeal in the innocence of the game; it's certainly not boring, and there are enough challenges and changes to keep you interested despite the fairly repetitive nature of platform gaming. It may appear cartoonish but there are some serious moral themes discussed and life lessons to be learnt. Picking up new abilities throughout the game gets you returning to previous maps to complete things you couldn't do earlier in the game, which nicely prevents it from being a linear run-through from one level to the next.\n\nIt's hard to criticise this game because it doesn't promise any more than it delivers. You don't feel short-changed by the simplicity of the game play or the slightly "cutesy" characters. It's easy to play through, which might be disappointing if you're looking for more of a challenge. It is fairly repetitive but the enemies do get tougher as the game develops, matching your character's development. The challenge arenas are the only places where you can really push your skills to try to get that elusive four-star rating.\n\nThe other downside is the boss fights - it's a button-masher so just keep hitting the combos for long enough and the boss goes down, it's as simple as that. But again, it's hard to criticise because the game delivers exactly what it promises. It's enjoyable but not astonishing. I recommend it as a pleasant and pretty game to play, a nice bit of simple escapism that isn't going to challenge or frustrate you.","August 2, 2014","true","56.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeraphinTheDolphin/recommended/236090/","SeraphinTheDolphin","Seraphin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeraphinTheDolphin/","141 products in account","I don't normally do Steam reviews, but for this game I had to make an exception.\n\nFor quite a few years now, I've found that today's games often feel stale and have lost a part of what makes them fun. I can't quite put my finger on why, but I do know that whatever it is that's missing has been revived in Dust: An Elysian Tail. I haven't found quite as much enjoyment out of a game since Oblivion, and Dust may even replace it as the #1 game I've ever played, in my book.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed everything that the game has to offer. The gameplay is fun: racking up awesome combos while smashing through groups of enemies is quite satisfying, and I found the game is at times challenging but never too hard nor too easy (based on my playthrough on Tough difficulty). The RPG elements help balance things but aren't at all too prominent or overpowering. The art is stunning, full of colour and atmosphere. The voice-acting, in my opinion, is excellently performed and the story is unique and quite touching. The soundtrack is amazing and each track matches perfectly with it's respective environment (I immediately had to buy the official soundtrack afterwards). Overall, an incredible amount of attention to detail has gone into Dust, and a level of polish you don't often find in the industry these days.\n\nAfter completing the main storyline, I went for 100% completion of the game (well, 116% or whatever it goes up to), not only for the obvious challenge, but also because it was simply fun to keep playing. I've got a lot of unfinished or half-arsed playthroughs sitting in my library because properly completing them just feels tedious and like a waste of time. This definitely isn't the case here and it took me back to those classic childhood games I could just keep playing for hours until I had explored every location and collected every item on offer.\n\nIn terms of negatives, the only ones I experienced are very minor. Occasionally an item may glitch into a wall with no way to get it out, but it rarely happened and was no big deal. Also, out of the 20 or so hours in the game it did crash twice – thankfully, though, the autosave system was there to minimise the amount of progress lost from those unfortunate times. None of these issues are at all game-breaking and don't really taint the game in any way, however. I personally don't think there are any major flaws at all with the game.\n\nConsidering everything, I'm blown away that the entire basis of Dust was designed and programmed by just one person. It's quite clear that he understands video games and what they're truly about. I definitely recommend this game to everyone – even at full-price it's totally worth it – and you should at the very least give it a try. Not doing so would be a disservice to yourself as a gamer.","February 7, 2014","true","23.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Coming from someone who has yet to play Castlevania or Metroid for that matter, I found this to be an amazing game. The soundtrack and the visuals are outright gorgeous. The story is also a great tale to tell; dark, yet humorous at the same time. Not only that, but the characters are also great, varying in many memorable personalities. I don’t mind the choice of art used, especially as I feel it would change the story too much if it was otherwise. My only problem with the game is that the combat can be a bit repetitive at times, but not too much, thankfully. This is literally why I am going to learn about programming; if one man can create nearly everything aside from the music and voice acting, and turn out something that gets such ratings as it got (9-10/10’s), this paves the way for others to do so too. I completely recommend this, as it serves not only as a great game, but as a pillar for others to follow their dreams as well.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenEarth/recommended/236090/","GreenEarth","♥Tide♬|trade.tf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenEarth/","61 products in account","So after 2 and a half years of development, we'd finally get this game: Dust: An Elysian tail.\n\nAnd please tell me if you get the gabe newell reference, but this game was worth the wait in every way.\n\nThroughout the game, i'd search for plotholes and flawed gameplay mechanics, and needsly to say, i couldn't find any.\nDust's controls are the opposite of stiff. The game is really responsive to controls, and it leads to some fun platforming and fast-paced gameplay. And while this game does have a rush bros disease of slow walking and fast rolling, I had an easy time ignoring it to the game's combat.\n\nNot only are you given a however small variety of attacks to dish out pain with, there's loads of combos that you can test yourself to execute and memorize with your keyboard, and you get rewarded for each combo. Not only do you get extra experience, you also get achivements, and your enemies of course die faster. While that does sum it up, this game also has its way of disapointment.\nAt the beginning of the game, you're given the blade of Ahrah, Fidget, And dus'ts glorious control to utilize and THATS. IT.\nLater in the game, you're informed ahrah is only ONE of the blades of elysium; Why couldnt we find and use the others? I wouldve liked more variety than just being stuck with 2 weapons to use. Fidget got more than one mode of attacking, why cant we?\n\nGameplay aside, the graphics, which are hand drawn by the way look GLORIOUS. They dont cause any eyestrain and there isnt a spam of color palette like rush bros had. The game is really pretty to look at and i hope you buy it for that reason.\n\nNow, lets go to the plot. In the beginning you see an unknown warrior charging through a variety of people for an unknown reason, and later find out he's killed by a child. In the next scene, you see our main character, dust, kneeling in the middle of an unknown forest. This is the game's first point of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off. You know why? THERES NO REAL CUTSCENES UNTIL NEAR THE END OF THE GAME. Otherwise, all you get is pictures that might as well mimic a slideshow along with text, it really made me depressed toward how such good artwork was put to waste. Anyway, we're introduced to our 3 protagonists, dust, fidget, and the blade of ahrah, which as i said earlier is the main weapon you'll be using throughout the game. We then see that dust has forgotten his past and that he summoned ahrah for yet another unknown reason. Dust doesnt even know why he did it, but he chooses to ignore it and go on a quest to find out more of his past, kill a bunch of racist knights, and simply bring justice where justice is needed with the help of fidget and the blade of ahrah.\nThis is why i like indie games like this, they keep the plot simple and fast to keep the player wanting to play their game. You might call it lazy, but it works.\n\nSo after all that said, I do like this game for a variety of reasons, (One i'd rather not say) And also, I think that this game has perfect potential and setup for a sequel. If there were a game called Dust 2 (No pun intended), I really hope they'd keep what made this game good and add onto it.","May 31, 2014","true","18.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The game autosaved over my original copy; I had thought that it was my own save that was updating… this was regrettably not the case. Good bye days worth. Please learn from my mistake.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  Dust: An Elysian Tail starts off very confusing, the story just kind of drops you into the game and says “Hey, you’re the hero, here’s a talking sword and an annoying fairy thing, go save the word!” Now that I think about it, this isn’t really an uncommon trait in video games.\nI won’t spoil the story, but I like how the main character looks, the game is very Asian-cultured,  you have your annoying side-kick who just makes your character look better, it has all it needs to have to be a good game… The only down side is that the game goes by really fast.\n\nGame Play:  The game play starts out very fast paced, I knew before I left the starting zone that I was going to enjoy it. The game is based on gaining exp through “combo’s” which you obtain through getting hits on enemies. You’ll figure out neat ways to go about doing this while you play the game and unlock new abilities.\nFidget (The side-kick / flying wombat / fairy-thing) throws magic, Dust uses a Magic sword and you use those two in collaboration in the air or on the ground. That’s what the game comes down to. Knowing when to fight in the air, and how and when to fight on the ground.\n\nAchievements: The achievements on this game are fun. I started the game right away on Normal difficulty, got nearly everything then reset my game and descided to replay on tough to get the final few achievements I missed.\nWhen I started the game on Normal I was very over confident and thought I could just zip through the game without needing to learn where my heal button is… That didn’t work out so great, so it’s not “easy” but it’s not “Super Meat Boy”. Most of the achievements can be obtained relatively easily once you’re familiar with the game.\n\nPrice: Dust: An Elysian Tail at normal price is going for $14.99, I would say that the game is priced fairly for the quality you will get. I only put 22 hours into the game, but I did rush a bit and had to look up a guide for the “find all your friends” achievement… The price might still be a bit high for someone with a strained check book.\nAs I say on most of my reviews, you may want to wait for this game to go on sale before you buy it, but it is definitely worth buying. Additionally it is currently in the Humble Bundle for the next eleven days! You might want to jump at the chance to get it now with a few other indie games: https://www.humblebundle.com/\n\nConclusion: I enjoyed this game, I felt that I got my money’s worth out of it, the story was excellent, the quality was impressive, the game play was fun. I don’t know what else you could ask out of a game like Dust: An Elysian Tail. I say this is a “Must Have” for anyone who enjoys 2D Indie Games.","February 20, 2014","true","22.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Although at first I thought maybe it was a little too childish for my age, I quickly forgot that! Dust creates an exciting world that completely immerses the player and pulls them along. I found this game was hard to put down and from discussing it with others I found they also had the same experience. It might seem like a more Kid-friendly game, which is how one friend initially described it to me, but I find it appeals to a large audience of all ages.  I loved the story line and the art style and music. Perhapse I might sound too biased towards the positives of this game and not really elaborate on flaws, but as I said before this game is addicting and I don't think there are any major flaws that would really turn a person off from this game. I find myself going out of my way to complete every little aspect to perfection just so I can get more playing time cause I'll be sad when its finally done. =) I really love this game and if you're hesitant to buy I hope this review helps.","July 25, 2014","true","67.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

A straightforward, side-scrolling platformer with simple button-mashing combo-style hack n' slash combat, pretty graphics, and a relatively interesting storyline. It's got a very stereotypical anime-esque appearance, but there's beauty in the simplicity of the game. It's extremely well developed, easy to pick up and play, and nicely eyecatching. The animation is wonderfully smooth, with very subtle background effects, and a wide variety of environments to move through as you open up more of the wider map.\n\nI tend to think of this game as being a bit simple, but it's a work of art and it's hard to believe that it was entirely the product of one person. It must have been a labour of love, and that effort shows through. Dust is an interesting character and, almost despite myself, I became engrossed in his story and the way in which it unfolded. I was expecting something very basic and repetitive as this is a 2D platformer I bought during the sale, mainly because I'm a sucker for pretty artwork in games. I didn't expect much beyond a couple of hours of simple gameplay and levelling up a few times before polishing off a boss and ending the game all in time for tea.\n\nA week later, after running through the game twice (I upped the difficulty level the second time around) and earning all of the achievements, proved me totally wrong. At first I was skeptical; I found the characters to be a little bit twee and stereotypical, but as they and the story line developed I got hooked. It's suitable for all ages so don't expect any gore or adult themes, but there's a certain appeal in the innocence of the game; it's certainly not boring, and there are enough challenges and changes to keep you interested despite the fairly repetitive nature of platform gaming. It may appear cartoonish but there are some serious moral themes discussed and life lessons to be learnt. Picking up new abilities throughout the game gets you returning to previous maps to complete things you couldn't do earlier in the game, which nicely prevents it from being a linear run-through from one level to the next.\n\nIt's hard to criticise this game because it doesn't promise any more than it delivers. You don't feel short-changed by the simplicity of the game play or the slightly "cutesy" characters. It's easy to play through, which might be disappointing if you're looking for more of a challenge. It is fairly repetitive but the enemies do get tougher as the game develops, matching your character's development. The challenge arenas are the only places where you can really push your skills to try to get that elusive four-star rating.\n\nThe other downside is the boss fights - it's a button-masher so just keep hitting the combos for long enough and the boss goes down, it's as simple as that. But again, it's hard to criticise because the game delivers exactly what it promises. It's enjoyable but not astonishing. I recommend it as a pleasant and pretty game to play, a nice bit of simple escapism that isn't going to challenge or frustrate you.","August 2, 2014","true","56.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blk_Mage_Ctype/recommended/236090/","Blk_Mage_Ctype","Bishop the Black","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blk_Mage_Ctype/","136 products in account","Dust: An Elysian Tail is a game that by this point in time really shouldn't need any introduction. The game has won multiple rewards, received much praise, and delighted many gamers, but how well does it hold up to all that hype?\nIn my opinion, very well, Admittedly the game does have its flaws, but when you stop to think about the fact that the vast majority of the game was made by one man, said flaws become much more forgivable. That said, the only note-worthy flaw with Dust: An Elysian Tail is the story, as it is rather generic. That's not to say that it's bad, but it's certainly nothing that you haven't heard before. However, that doesn't prevent Dust: An Elysian Tail from being a highly entertaining gaming experience. While the story may not be all that fresh, it does still manage to be entertaining, thanks mostly to Fidget, who will be your faithful companion throughout the game. You may have heard certain folks compare Fidget to Navi from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, but I have no idea where they're drawing that comparison from. Fidget isn't some annoying creature with no purpose by to point out the painfully obvious and pester you every 5 minutes by reminding you of what you should be doing to advance the plot, but a fully realized and fleshed-out character with lots of humorous dialog. Without Fidget, Dust: An Elysian Tail would be far less entertaining in the story department, but thanks to her and her dialog/commentary, Dust's story becomes far more interesting.\n\nGameplay-wise, Dust: An Elysian Tail is more or less your standard "Metroidvania" fare, with side-scrolling action, lots of areas to explore, platforming, you know the drill. However, Dust: An Elysian Tail also has RPG elements, such as stats, a Level Up System, Magic, loot, crafting, and items that will increase your stats. Granted that Castlevania: Symphony of the Night also had RPG elements, but Dust's feel a bit deeper than that, more in line with games like Muramasa: The Demon Blade than SotN, albeit the combat isn't quite as deep as Muramasa.\n\nGraphics-wise, Dust: An Elysian Tail is beautiful game. All of the visuals were hand-drawn by Dean Dodril (the game's creator) himself, and they're gorgeous. However, words alone can't do it justice at all, so take a peek at the Screenshots and see for yourself.\n\nSound-wise, Dust: An Elysian Tail is beautiful as well. Hyperduck Studios did an excellent job on this game's soundtrack, and they really deserve more recognition for their work. Every bit of music in this game hits its mark, perfectly reflecting what's going on in the game around it.\n\nThere's really not much more that I can tell you about the game, it's really something that you'll have to experience yourself. At $14.99, the game is well worth it, and I'm sure that you won't regret it.","May 22, 2014","true","15.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/martynasx/recommended/236090/","martynasx","Scoots","http://steamcommunity.com/id/martynasx/","312 products in account","I played through the game on Hardcore difficulty and enjoyed it. This is one of the best Indie games I have played. It has amazing artwork, great sence of humour and intersting characters. The story keeps you interested and you will want to know what will happen next, who is everybody and why things are happening. There are some references from other games (some are very well hidden) but not too hard to find if you use your head.\n\nSome negative points worth noting:\n\nI used xbox 360 controller to play and sometimes found that using analog stick to perform certain actions might cause you to do the wrong move. This is really annoying when you try to do trials where time and precision is crucial. I failed so many times when my character jumped instead of ducking and sliding or vice versa. I do however recommend playing with a controller even though keyboard and mouse works great, controller is still better.\n\nYou will probably want to play it once because once you know the story there will be no point in playing again so if you played on casual you are simply wasted your time because it was too easy and you can finish it in few hours. There are, however, 25 sidequestes which you can complete and you won't get all achievements unless you do them all.\n\nDifficulty curve is not ideal. On harcode mode is really hard to start that will cause you to die over and over until you reach some levels or keep killing same enemies over and over. Later on it when you level up and get some items it becomes too easy. Simply be patient and you will enjoy the game without any annoying issues.\n\nOverall it is great game that is worth your time. I spent over 30 hours and got all the achievements.","December 29, 2013","true","32.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Upgrades and new abilities are well-paced throughout, allowing you to choose whether you'd like to keep pushing forward, or backtrack for hidden treasures. I will separately note that the musical score is also extremely strong, with Hyperduck providing BGM that is memorable and very much a pleasure to listen to.\n\nWith so many games featuring a laundry-list of tacked-on features or grindy content filler, it is refreshing to play an exploration game that gets to the point by focusing on its core competencies, and does them well.

I would put off buying it from one sale to another thinking I could always pick it up later. Finally during this winter sale I picked it up and after playing it for several hours I only had one question… what the hell took me so long?\n\nDust features multiple game mechanics and effectively make them work together in a cohesive experience. Firstly it’s a colorful 2D side scroller with vivid backdrops and a large open field. The combat plays like a responsive hack and slash action adventure game, including combo styles and magical attacks provided by your comedic sidekick Fidget, which in turn can then be combined into different flavours of multi attacks. That combat is backed up with a full RPG style level system where upon leveling you are able to increase various stats making your character that much more of a killing machine. And if that’s not enough there is also a full crafting system allowing you to collect blueprints, materials and combine them into new weapon, armor or accessories.\n\nThe game world itself features a world map which is traversed by selecting way points, taking you to the subsequent zone. Each zone is made up of many screens, each with a multitude of enemies, platform puzzles and secrets to be found. Shrines act as save points and teleporters, which enable you to fast travel to the entrances of others zones, for a cost. Stores can also found in these zones which work much like stores in most games, but in this case the first time you sell a material to the vendor it will catalogue it, and then every so often add more of that item to its stock allowing you to buy more of that item for your crafting needs.\n\nAs for the story of Dust, it follows the titular Dust on the typical quest to prevent all out genocide. At the start of his journey, Dust, Finds himself with amnesia, not knowing who he is or what his purpose is. It is here he is joined by a talking mythical sword “Ahrah” and the swords Guardian Nimbat “Fidget” who will help guide Dust on his path. The story itself follows familiar tropes but manages to make it feel fresh while still throwing in a few twists to narrative thread.\n\nDust is jam packed with mechanics and classic side scrolling mayhem offering a solid 10+ hours of gameplay with plenty of secrets, and familiar faces to collect. Don’t be like me and hesitate to buy it, just buy it already.\n\n4.5/5\n","January 4, 2014","true","12.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game was an absolute blast to play through, especially for a genre I generally don't enjoy (this being the Beat-Em-Up aspect of the game, not the Metroidvania aspect of it). The world is highly open and fun to explore, with absolutely incredible atmosphere and a slightly cliché though very well polished story. The music as a whole is solid, though admittedly I only really found myself truly attached to a few songs in the game. It fits the world though, and it knows when to pick up and when to slow down. The characters are pretty enjoyable, each of which having their own unique qwerks and characterization to make each individual character in the game so compelling. It helps that the voice acting is honestly pretty good. The anthropomorphic-animal-type character design is offputting at first, but it really didn't detract from anything.\n\nAll of this is topped off by one of the most fluid, reactive, and satisfying combat engines I think I've ever played. Combos are given to you relatively early so you have plenty of time to practice using them, and I'd be lying if I didn't say I haven't sent chills down my spine for some of the absolutely insane stuff I've been able to pull of. Despite having one weapon (two if you count his companion Fidget), Dust has a huge variety of ways to handle pretty much every enemy in the game, and very rarely does mowing down hordes of minions ever get stale. The artstyle helps ludicrously in this department, making each hit feel rewarding and managing to maintain a long-lasting combo stupidly satisfying. This game has its share of Action RPG elements in it as well, with stuff like shops, level ups, and various equipment options to choose from as the game expands.\n\nAll of this made the game such an absolute thrill to play, and if you can manage to snag it for the deal I got it at (Three and a half dollars!? What!?), there's no question as to whether you buy this game or not. This game is nearly flawless.\n\nOh, and pretty much all of this game was made by one person - Dean Dodrill. Incredible.","December 14, 2013","true","10.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

And explaining why seems to be the most difficult thing I've ever written.\n\nLet's start simple, the music is pretty damn gorgeous! There are only a few games that fit flwalessly to the game and are really enjoyable to listen independetly as well. None of the tracks gets annoying over time and they support the game flow from start to finish.\nThe story is well-written, and even though I normally prefer darker and more brutal atmosphere in my games, having a fairy taler occasionally can feel refreshing. And this one really does! The two main characters are really fun to take through the solid yet somewhat simplistic main story, their interactions with each other never fail to characterize them both and their bond. Some of the supporting characters are not so strong, though, but it didn't really bother me.\nBut the real meat here is the fighting system and especially the controls. I've never played a game with as tight control set as Dust. If you die, it's your own fault for making a balant mistake. You really feel like you are in control at any time. The system itself is really simple, yet it never got boring in my first playthrough. Every fight was thoroughly satisfying and the platforming, while I usually hate it, felt natural and fun to play.\n\nThe only bad thing I can say is the difficulty level, which is too easy for me. And the fact that after completing this game, other games feel dull and colourless... =D\n\nDust is easily the best game I've played for quite a while. If there is any chance you'd enjoy a good metroidvania platformer, give this one a try. I give it my biggest recommendations!","March 16, 2014","true","14.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Is a good way to get into several kinds of games. Also includes a concept called "FUN".\n\n[Length - average]: This game is too short. Depending on how much of a completionist you are- my playtime would have been 3 hours less if I hadn't gotten lost a couple times while looking in every nook and cranny to get to some of the hidden locations for the lost friends before giving in to frustration and googling it. I also don't think it has a lot of replay value.\n\n[Difficulty - good]: There's not much to say about this, you've got the casual, medium, hard and 1-Hit KO levels. I would say some of the platforming and the 6 Trials are a challenge regardless of which mode you set the game to though.\n\n[Combat - excellent]: Being a sword-wielding-furry-assassin with a cat-like-bat-thing that can shoot lightning and fire, in addition to lightbulbs, who can then do screen-clearing combo attacks is kind of awesome...\n\n[Music/Sound - good]: I couldn't hear the actual music most of the time because of all the exploding enemies and other sound effects but when I did hear it, it matched the surroundings perfectly. The sound effects are also spot on and paired with the music, proceeded to make this 25 year old freak the heck out in Sorrowing Meadow (I would recommend not letting your young children see the spiders or mansions).\n\n[Voice Acting - good]: All the voices were decent which is saying something considering I try to mute that feature most of the time because of how bad it is usually. Fidget's voice actor, especially, nailed it in cutscenes with emotions or humor and her interactions with Dust really made me like the little sidekick.\n\n[Graphics - excellent]: I love the artstyle which is simple yet detailed at the same time and allows for even toasters like mine to run it flawlessly...unless you turn on weather and bloom effects which ruins the art and your framerate simultaneously!\n\n[Story/Characters - excellent]: The story is very short and straightforward for the most part. It's not bad though because it's told well and the characters are what really brings it to life. I would almost describe the game's plot as a prologue or origin story because of...\n\n[The Ending - good]: Other than feeling empty because you have to find something else to play now- It satisfies you by wrapping up the main point of the game while giving you the craving for a sequel it so kindly dangles above you.","June 15, 2015","true","22.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Granted it's generally possible to breeze your way through the game by maxing Fidget's magic first, the melee combos and building chains is great fun.\n\nThis game is also aesthetically pleasing to the maximum, I couldn't fault someone for thinking this was a professionally animated movie (maybe because it almost was) for the beautiful character and environment design.\n\nThroughout the story things evolve from very tongue-in-cheek tropes to the very serious and emotional later stages.  All along the way humor is balanced with serious moments perfectly.\n\nAs far as I'm aware Dust is largely bug free, and the options menu is something to take the ♥♥♥♥ out of even modern AAA titles.\n\nSeriously, if you haven't already get your hands on this game.

The music is top-notch, the gameplay is repetitive, but in a good way. As you progress in the game, you will learn new combos/abilities to try out and link with others to make bigger combos for additional experience to level up faster, which you will then use the "level points" that you have received to choose which stat you want to increase.\n\nHowever, this does bring some faults with the game. Because you can choose which one you want, you can just rack up on attack and play with a "kill them before they kill me" playstyle. I find this is what makes the game too easy, since you can never get hit this way if you just bulk up your offense.\n\nBesides that, the combat is butter-smooth and the slashes actually do feel like they register when you attack.  Even though you only have one weapon, there's a huge variety of moves you have along with Fidget's three powers, which I will not spoil. The game's shopkeeper which is found in "dungeons", Sereth, is a charming reference to the Resident Evil 4's shoopkeeper, which I am sure many of you will enjoy. Along with the basic buying and selling, you can sell the shopkeeper certain materials required for foraging in which he will stock up on them and will be avaible by any merchant in the game, which I found to be a nice touch.\n\nThere's also easter eggs galore, a lenghty campaign, and the fact that this game was produced by one person (minus voice acting and composition), it's a stellar experience. It's highly recommeded you pick up this game, especially on a Steam sale.","December 28, 2013","true","7.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Visually, the game is amazing, bringing gorgeous graphics and animation, excellent gameplay. However, it has (so far) a clichéd story we've seen several times before, delivering yet another amnesiac protagonist, which is the game's weakest point (really, we don't need another of those)...\nBut that being just one low point, this game is still very much recommended, especially if you're a Metroidvania fan. As an extra recommendation, ignore Easy and Normal difficulty modes entirely and start playing on Tough for your first playthrough. It's the one I started on, and it seems to deliver a good balance, being challenging at times but not to the point of being unfair.\n\nAnd if you need something more to convince you, it has Mysterious Wall Chicken.","June 10, 2014","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The world of Dust is presented with amazing scenery and hand drawn and animated characters accompanied by beautiful music. You take control of an amnesic swordsman on a journey to discover himself and every character you meet along the way is voice acted and memorable. Not the least of is Fidget a character accompanies you the whole game and provides much of the game's needed comic relief. There is a real sense of joy as you uncover more of the story as you play, and help Dust learn more about himself (as well as hear what Fidget has to say about various encounters).\n\nGameplay wise Dust is a 2D metroidvania platformer. As you slice baddies you earn experience which you can use to improve your stats as you see fit and equip and craft items to further enhance your stats. Over the course of the game you and Fidget also gain further abilities to allow more freedom in not only disposing of your enemies but also reaching new areas. Apart from the main story there are a number of side-quests as well as hidden arenas to test your skill. And it is all a blast to play. I would really recommend a gamepad to play, especially an XBox 360 Controller.\n\nThe most impressive thing about Dust: An Elysian Tail is the fact that apart from the music, voice acting and part of the story, Dust was created, programmed and drawn entirely by one man,  Dean Dodrill. So in a way Dust is like an American equivalent of Cave Story. I know that may sound like a stretch, but honestly this game has brought me a lot of joy and fond memories and I would highly recommend this to anyone.","July 8, 2014","true","18.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BHK3/recommended/236090/","BHK3","Smash-It Stan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BHK3/","211 products in account","The game is pretty fun, the biggest downsides come to basic design flaws that stretch over the whole game.\n\nGraphics: Incredibily furry, I was honestly uncomfortable playing it at first but I got used to it. You simply can't make a deviantart artstyle without it coming off as incredibly wrong to people that are familiar with the internet. Other than that the animations are smooth but readibility can be a pain, there'll be ♥♥♥♥ all over the screen which will obscure an enemy who will go a little dark meaning he's dodged into the background behind you than molly whops you for half-all of your HP.\n\nGameplay: You learn every move within an hour, the rest of the moves you learn are locked away from you by story barriers and are only for traversal, so the beginning area will sit at 75% discovery until you're halfway through the game because you don't have the abilities needed to reach the chests that have like 1000 gold in them(you'll be swimming in gold very quickly anyway). So yes, the game only has 3 or so combos, fidget your little tails the flying furry pal of ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ can learn more moves more than you, which is pretty great. The game is overall very easy, the entire game is very metroidvania(i hate this term but that's the closest thing I can think of to describe it) so that means big wide open areas with treasure and ♥♥♥♥ hidden around everywhere. Unfortunatly the areas are too big and your character is too slow, which means you'll be using your moves to traverse faster than wait for the move to cooldown than spin some more to go faster. The game has different difficulty levels that do nothing except increase enemy damage, this is where the gameplay flaws really come in.\n\n\nThe games just way too easy, despite only having 3 combo attacks, spinng your sword and mashing the fidget-kill-everything-on-screen button wipes enemies up like poo on butts. You'll start to feel like it's a chore and you're not really getting anything except gold and blueprints to craft new items(get a craft piece, sell to vendor, he catalogues it, buy infinite amounts) which are useless because you can run by every enemy and go into the next big area and get even better stuff. You level up in terms of strength and defense in a very simple manner, just go into the next area and get the good loot. I played the game on hardcore and it was frustrating, you're basically never going to be at full HP because the slightest hit will do half or more of your lifebar, so yeah you'll be destroying everything in sight, when you do get hit you will die. Yes there are healing items and you get plenty but it becomes a waste healing to full than getting nicked by an enemy that decided not to get stunlocked/staggered(this will happen a lot) and kill you. Bosses are pitiful and behave the same as enemies, so knock them into the air and destroy them unless they decide to ignore your attacks and kill you, turning a 10 second fight into a 2 minute respawn and die ordeal praying the AI just stops ♥♥♥♥ing cheating.\n\nMusic,story,everything else: It's all fine and passable. Story is "get this 20 chicken feathers I'll give you money" quests along with a big main quest of "WHO AM I WHAT AM I FIGHTING FFFOOOOORRRR" story arc that at least has passable voice acting and nice presentations. Music is nothing special, I usually have it off and listen to my Morgan Page podcasts.","July 28, 2014","true","18.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As if it wasn't strange enough, a magical sword finds you and speaks to you, followed by a small, annoying creature. They accompany you on a journey to find who you are, why you awoke with no memory, and why you were chosen to wield a magical sword.\n\nPresentation: 8/10\nThe story isn't groundbreaking but is enough to get anyone to wonder what's in store for a protagonist with amnesia as he travels through the country. Dust is a kind character, who helps those he can (if you complete the quests) until he finds his past. The game adequately tells the tale from start to finish, but you can never really tell how much of an impact you're making by the end.\n\nGraphics: 7.5/10\nCute cartoon artstyle settles well and takes your mind off the fact that Dust: An Elysian Tail was designed and programmed by a single individual.\n\nSound: 7.5/10\nThe pleasant music never stuck itself in places unneeded, a good addition overall. The voice acting was good for some characters, but never made Fidget any less annoying.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nFluid, fast-paced and with different options to attack your enemies, the combat was well received. There are many items to acquire, along with the secret non-playable characters hidden throughout the game. My only gripe is the hideous transitioning of the camera as you fly through the map.\n\nOverall: 7.8/10\nA good purchase if you're looking for some action/adventure. With only limited replayability, the game can keep you busy for several days before you find yourself with not much else to do, but for a well-polished game, its price is definitely worth it.","July 3, 2014","true","86.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DT_76/recommended/236090/","DT_76","DT76","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DT_76/","62 products in account","This game wasn't quite what I expected.  It's one of those titles where the enemies are pretty tough & do a lot of damage, but are slow and telegraph their attacks.  Your character, on the other hand, is fragile and doesn't hit very hard, but can attack with great rapidity.  So, your only chance of winning (esp. on the higher difficulties) is to keep your foes stunlocked  with an all-out assault, chaining hits and special moves together to never give them an opening.  As I've stated before, I don't really like fighting games, where you have to pull off specific key combinations with millisecond timing.  This is pushing things a little, but I was still able to use the combos they had programmed in, which is fortunately not that many.  This does limit the depth of the system and mean the combats can get very same-y after a while, though.\n\nSo, it feels kind of incongruous.  Your protagonist is basically a walking abattoir, chewing through monsters with gusto.  Except he's also supposed to be a rabbit, I guess?  And all the other characters are cartoon animals too?  The story similarly veers back and forth between srs bzns and light-hearted banter.  It doesn't help matters that the game is one of the worst offenders in the Cutesy Sidekick That Never Shuts Up category.\n\nThe art and animation are top-notch, considering this is a small-budget title.  It's not quite up there with the Odin Spheres of the world, but damn close.  The whole game is a bit on the short side, and probably much shorter still if you don't bother  hunting down all the sidequests and collecting everything.  That said, I had a lot of fun with it, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys action-RPGs.","July 7, 2014","true","20.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You run around, jump and kill a lot of stuff. You kill stuff by swinging your talking sword and employing the abilities of your flying squirrel-thingy Fidget, which sometimes bears resemblance to such annoying sidekicks like Navi from the Legend of Zelda.\nThe fighting itself is pretty simple. Your standard attack is a 3-hit combo, on the ground and in the air. Combine with your special ability and your sidekick you create some nice combos. You will also learn some new moves along your way, but they're primarily for traversing the world, which - in best Metroidvania-manner - has a lot of places you can't get through until you have the ability needed for it.\nIf you want to explore and get absolutely everything, you'll have to do a LOT of backtracking, but you can also use teleport stones that make it a bit easier.\nBesides fighting and finding treasures you'll also encounter many NPCs you can talk to. Talking might reveal information and sidequests. You will also get experience from talking to NPCs, which I find a really nice little feature.\nCrafting is also present. Defeating enemies or opening treasure chests might get you blueprints and material to craft the items from the blueprints. To make that a bit easier you can sell material to the shopkeepers, who then add them to their inventory, which makes it possible to purchase those materials from them. Quite handy if you can't or don't want to find them on your way around.\n\nThe game looks absolutely incredible btw. Beautiful levels accompanied by a nice soundtrack.\nNot a big fan of the character design though. I don't mind antropomorphic animals in the slightest, but I just didn't like how many of them looked.\nAlso worth mentioning is the voice acting, as it's quite good. Not all were that good, but mostly it was very well done.\n\nAll things considered a really nice game with a decent story, good gameplay and gorgeous visuals :)","July 17, 2014","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That has turned out to be one of the best game purchases of my life.\n\nSo, why should you buy Dust: An Elysian Tail?\n\nFirst, the beautifully hand-crafted art is to die for.\n\nSecond, as an action-packed platformer, the combat system is easy to learn but hard to master. You'll take awhile before you\nlearn how to snag achievements like That's More Like It (Successfully complete a 1000+ hit combo) and The Stuff of Legends (Earn a Four-Star Rating in EVERY Challenge Arena), which makes it that little bit sweeter when you do.\n\nThird, apart from it's main storyline, there are many side-quests and secret locations to conquer and discover. Looking to uncover them all? Don't stop at 100% completion, it goes up to 117% completion. Amen.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, is the compelling storyline. There is a fine balance between humour and drama. You'll be hooked to follow the storyline up till the grand finale.\n\nYour parents probably told you to never talk to strangers, but I need you to trust me and do yourself a favour by purchasing and playing this game. You have no idea what you're missing out on if you don't.","June 19, 2014","true","24.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kirbizard/recommended/236090/","kirbizard","Kirbizard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kirbizard/","220 products in account","An absolutely beautiful game with fluid animations and solid brawler mechanics.\n\nWhile there is very little in the way of weapon variety, you're still provided with a range of options for taking out enemies from your basic brawler combos to parrying and aerial throws, all of which are animated gorgeously. Despite being limited to one weapon, you do earn additional magic powers and movement skills, such as double jumps and wall clinging, as the game goes on, which help open up new areas to explore places you couldn't before.\n\nThe majority of the skills you learn in the tutorial will be your bread and butter through a majority of the game. Thankfully, enemies later in the game do test everything you've learnt, so relying on a single tactic won't do you many favours, with some being only vulnerable to parries and others to magic attacks.\n\nCombined, the combat looks and feels great and doesn't outstay it's welcome for the 9 to 12 hours it takes to beat the game.\n\nThe game also borrows a lot from RPGs with a level up system, side quests and a crafting mechanic, allowing you to build upgrades from blueprints dropped by enemies and found in chests. The upgrades usually add an additive or multiplicative effect to stats, item drops or health regeneration, which doesn't occur naturally otherwise.\n\nThe entire game is fully voiced, which is an impressive feat for an indie title of this size. There are points where the dialogue feels forced, which can be chalked down to a problem with the script at points, but the main cast do a pretty spectacular job with their characters and help compliment the animation work nicely.\n\nIf you have any experience with videogames in the past at all, I'd highly recommend playing the game on the Tough difficulty setting, as the Normal difficulty is far too forgiving. The Tough difficulty gives you a good reason to buy and use consumables without piling things on enough to make you ever feel overwhelmed.\n\nMentioning the game is programmed and animated by one person is a moot point, but one that's bound to be brought up if you read up on the game on other sites or reviews. The game easily oozes enough quality and polish that, outside some late game cutscenes, you'd never realise or believe one man did all that work over four years.\n\nI highly recommned this game so much, that I even spent time writing out a review of this length. Hopefully, it's filled with enough information to make you consider trying it out. :)","February 28, 2014","true","16.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a small plot twist and not your regular good vs evil cliche tail\n--------------------------------\nCons:\n- Voice acting is quite bad in most cases\n- The closeup characters in dialogs are too plain and quite silly\n- Gameplay becomes very easy once you get the idea on how to handle those punching bags called "monsters"\n- Balance is managed by sheer damage. Should've added more divercity to the endgame boss battles and enemy attacks\n--------------------------------\nTips for beginners:\n- Play on hardcore. You will have some problems at the beginning, but don't be afraid to experiment.\n- Learn how to counter attack. It will take some time to learn the timing, especially with the first tree miniboss and those mothafrakking slimes...\n- Don't sell red crystals. Since monsters respawn after each load, it could save a lot of time for you. Also usefull for learning the monster patterns, without having to reload too often\n- Don't save money. Towards the end you will have over 100k unused gold.\n- You can't reach some areas. You should come back once you get the required skills\n- Max level is 60. You will be able to max all skills. Though Fidget is by far the best one.\n- Fidget is your friend. She will tell you (a popup when enter the area) if there is a missed secret on the map\n- Unlock "friends" from the cages. There are 12 of them and it will give you wooping 60% health bonus total.\n- Don't rush the game and play only few hours at a time. You will finish it in 15-30 hours.\n--------------------------------\n\nOverall a great Metroidvania kind of game that's easily worth its full price. It could use a little bit more TLC and depth to the gameplay mechanics and NPC's.","February 25, 2014","true","30.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

It combines a compelling story full of interesting characters with a style of gameplay that's challenging while never feeling tedious or boring.\n\nThis game's got an atmosphere of adventure that makes the world of Falana one that you want to explore and discover more about. The movement and combat feel impressively fluid and help to further draw you into the environment. Everything seems to happen at a perfect pace, whether it be leveling up, gaining new skills, or moving forward in the story. There are several sidequests in addition to the main one that will introduce you to even more of the world's inhabitants and locations. Additional features like the crafting system, trial courses, and hidden secrets all add value and fun to the game experience.\n\nThe amount of work put into this game is obvious from the quality and detail of every aspect. The art and music styles are fantastic--the look of characters, creatures, and environments, the background music, the visual and audio effects, and the cutscene animations all add to the mysterious and intriguing atmosphere. Better voicework than many other games, too, even if lines are a little slow sometimes (and even if recording quality for some characters isn't the best); the characters will draw you in and really make you feel like a part of the story. Once you pick up this game, you won't want to put it down.\n\nBottom line: DEFINITELY worth your time. Highly recommended.","March 26, 2014","true","30.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Dust looks great. has amazing soundtracks, badass and smooth looking combat filled with a ton of effects, precise and well made controls, an interesting story and tons of optional content to explore.\n\nDust itself plays like a highly polished metroidvania game - you make your way through areas, later on you get new moves that allow you to discover optional paths and treasures in areas you have already visited before.\nDuring your explorations, you will meet some civilians that offer you sidequests which reward you with additional items and experience points.\nThis, ofcourse, makes Dust stronger in a variety of ways. Experience Points are self explanatory, you collect them and get level ups (level cap is 60), each level up rewards you with one skill gem that can be used to upgrade your health, attack, defense or fidget (fidget is your companion and can be treated like a magical stat).\nEvery skill can be upgraded 15 times, but the game limits you in a way that your highest skill can only be 4 skill levels higher than your lowest one (your defense is on level 1, so you can't upgrade anything else past level 5).\nThis sounds like a big limitation at first, but it helps alot by keeping the game challenging throughout all areas, otherwise you could just max out fidget and oneshot everything while ignoring all other stats.\n\nIn addition to leveling you can also get stronger by finding / crafting / buying new equipment.\nEvery area has different enemies that drop different items, and every area also has some places where you can buy and sell items. Enemies can also drop material items, those can be used to craft your own gear (if you have the required blueprints which also drop from enemies and from treasure chests).\nEquipment slots that you can fill are the following : armor, sword augment, amulet, 2x rings.\nDust only has his sword in terms of physical damage, and if you equip yourself with a sword augment you will increase your physical damage output. the other items can also provide various other bonus attributes - automated health regen, better chance for item drops, more experience gain etc.\n\nThe icing on the cake however is the absolutely amazing soundtrack. Rarely do you find a game where the soundtrack adds so much to atmosphere and fun. You enter a new area and listen to the music, and you are just like "damn, that sounds amazing". Even with Dust being an extremely colorful game, the music still manages to provide a dark and mysterious atmosphere when needed, which really makes it a joy to play. example track : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUIDOvJiJ40\n\nDepending on the difficulty level (4 available) you choose, you will get around 10-15 hours of gametime when going for 100% completion - and trust me, you will go for 100%, since the game manages to make backtracking and exploring a lot of fun.\n\nNo matter who you are, i can only recommend Dust to you. It has been the best game i have played for ages (since the release of Final Fantasy 10 i guess) and you will definitely not regret spending money on this masterfully crafted gem of a game, especially if you like metroidvania games with stylish combat and great music.\n\n10/10 would buy again.","January 9, 2014","true","20.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But honestly, I don't see such creative, catchy and full of emotion storyline like in that game in years. I really loved the game, the emotion of the characters, the suspense, the fear, the hope...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MachoFantastico/recommended/236090/","MachoFantastico","Macho Fantastico","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MachoFantastico/","281 products in account","Developing video games is tough, even from the outside that seems obvious. It's not impossible, but it's one hell of a challenge, one that takes patience, time and talent to name just a few of the requirements to make it in the industry. So designer Dean Dodrill's accomplishments with Dust: An Elysian Tail is one to be applauded. Having developed the vast majority of this charming action adventure game himself, it's clear throughout that this is Dean's baby, resulting in a game that's beautiful, fun and one of the most captivating 2D side-scrollers I've played in years.\n\nDust: An Elysian Tail tells the story of Dust, a being with little knowledge of his past or his own identity. He's Awaken from slumber by a talking floating sword called Ahrah and the swords protectorate Fidget, a flying bat slash cat creature thing. This strange partnership must band together to help Dust figure out both his past and future in the lands of Falana, which have been beaten down by the terrors and horrors of war. For a story, it's one that nicely contrasts against much of the games visual design and isn't afraid to touch on some mature story points from the death and killing of innocents to the terrible physical and mental impact of war on those that survive it. I found myself surprised by the direction taken by the story till the very end and it's an area of the game that held strong throughout resulting in a story that benefits in developing the world as much as it keeps the tale chugging along.\n\nNow upon it's release Dust received some criticism for its art style, which to some degree I can understand. It's most certainly not an ugly game by any regard, the wonderful 2D landscapes are gorgeous with an impressive level of attention given to almost every level of the game, but some might find themselves turned off by the furry like characters that popular the lands of Falana. Personally I was charmed with it's interesting cast of characters all voiced to an high degree resulting in a world that's more interesting than you'd think it had any right to be. Dust's small but useful sidekick Fidget in particular is an high point thanks to some great dialogue and cute voice work by Kimlinh Tran. It all results in an high level of polish that you can't help but admire considering the time and effort put in by the mainly one man development team.\n\nAn action packed side-scroller, Dust is primarily inspired by the likes of Castlevania and Metroid with it's walled off sections that make traversal and map navigation part of the challenge. Anyone who's spent time with the genre will feel right at home here thanks to the fact that navigation is a breeze and finding all those treasures and secrets as always been part of the real fun with these sorts of games. An Elysian Tail is no different and while you'll be traveling a large variety of regions, you'll find himself traveling back to lands you've already visited in search of treasures that were once inaccessible to you. On his journey Dust will have access to new and varied powers that can be used to discover and access these treasures and even be used in combat. The powers range from the ability to slide under walls to secondary jumps to be able to double jump and reach higher points in the landscape. What's great about all these powers is that there just as effective in combat as they are when platforming.\n\nFalana is a land filled with a nice variety of baddies to swing your magical sword at and thankfully combat remains fun for the most part, even if I did find myself button mashing most of the time. Enemies will reappear if you exit and reenter an area so it's possible to grind your skills and levels if you wish. One note I'd add is that on normal, Dust can be a little to easy and whilst there are a few challenges here and there, it's not exactly a difficult game so you might want to consider playing are a harder difficulty level if that's your thing. Leveling up and enhancing skills is a fun addition, as is the ability to craft and equip new items to wear, although some might find crafting items becomes a nuisance once you near the end. All that said, every gameplay mechanic at work plays well together resulting in an highly polished experience and one I had fun with until the very end.\n\nSo Dust: An Elysian Tail is an impressive achievement by Dean Dodrill and his team of various contributors in the two years of development. It's an impressive achievement because you wouldn't guess that the majority of it's development was worked on by only one man. Rich in content, visually beautiful and sounding great, not to mention a story that's more memorable than you've come to expect from the genre, it all results in a game I'd highly recommend you play for yourself, even if you're turned off by the character designs. Dust: An Elysian Tail is one of the most charming games I've played in quite a while.\n\n","March 21, 2014","true","18.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Music fits the graphics. Fighting system is simple but very enjoyable. It's fast, easy (From complexity standpoint) and visually appealing (everything explodes, shines, combos goes up to few hundrets).\nIt's a metroidvania with a light RPG elements. Story is kinda generic, but it's satisfying,\n\nThe only problem I had was how the characters looks like.\nEnemies looks relatively good, but NPC have that very cheap furry/cartoon style. I would rather like to see more "direct furry approach" or at least better quality of them  (shading, color pallete, more details, etc.). The only good looking NPC is Fidget (that flying cat/bat thingy... She's a Nimbat.).\n\nCharacters are very good written. Oh, and Fidget is The Cutest character in video game I've ever seen. A want a plushie of her :3  (so I can keep her foreveeerrr....)\n\nAnyway, Game took me about 13h to fully complete it, it's relatively hard on "hard difficulty", I haven't encountered any bugs or errors. I was playing it on Windows XP (Steam says it requires Vista/7). No slowdowns. In other words - Works good.\n\nNothing much to say, really. It's a fantastic game, you should go and buy it.

It isn't often that a game comes along and leaves me with my mouth agape, shocked at the ratio of quality to manpower given to bring something to fruition. It was basically a one-man job, with a few exceptions to music, voice-acting and parts of the writing. This is not a game that makes you think that at all.\n\nBeautiful, strong, crisp, varied, colorful aesthetic that leads to gorgeous graphics. Music that evokes that classic, childlike sense of wonder of exploring, excitement, and adventure. Every time I would just bring up the map screen to teleport to a different area, it's evoke a powerful sense of nostalgia from me.\n\nCombatwise, everything is done with a blade and elemental ranged attacks, with ways to mix and match them all together. It's basically like a side-scrolling, platforming brawler with a nice degree of variation on enemy types and available tactics on taking them down.\n\nThe story starts off somewhat simple, and feels like it's treading familiar territory for a little while, but quickly becomes more complex as it goes on. I won't give any spoilers, but needless to say, I wasn't expecting the game to do what it did later on, close to the finish.\n\nIf I have any nitpicks, they are few. The lip-synching on the characters is a bit off, without much difference between the few mouth movements available. The voice-acting, while quite good overall, tends to give certain characters voices that don't quite fit, in addition to there being rather uneven sound quality amongst the performances. Still, these are both very minor issues, and I stopped noticing them after a while. It's just something I thought I should mention.\n\nHonestly, I could go on with this, but I don't want to keep you waiting. Overall, Dust: An Elysian Tail is one of the best games I've played in quite a while. It was a stellar experience, and I think that anyone who is able to make a game like this almost by themselves definitely deserves support. I recommend it to just about anyone.","February 15, 2014","true","21.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even right through to the end I found the characters and their art and voices to have an extremely amateur flavour. The entire thing seemed like a bog standard furry Flash on Newgrounds. Your companion especially is pretty much godawful throughout, with the occasional humourous quip. However, I persevered, and with a second launch of the game I started to overlook that initial shortcoming and start to get into what is in fact, a very good game. The settings and backgrounds were gorgeous and varied (why couldn't the artist that did that do the characters?) and I also liked the majority of the monster designs. The levels had a satisfyingly open feel with a nice sense of scale and immersion; I especially liked the zombie meadow level. The combat, levelling and crafting systems work well (although my completionist nature did seem to make my character rather overpowered towards the end of the game, making the final boss fight extremely easy), and the game has a decent amount of varied and interesting equipment to kit out your character with. While primarily an action game, I found many of the hidden treasures and their puzzles quite satisfying, and especially liked the secret 'Friends' and their bonuses. The hidden Trials were also quite a lot of fun to master, giving a little bit of extra to the game. I also found the story good with an interesting setup, although suffering from the standard aribtrary development stifling (AKA "You'll find out later because no reason other than it'll make the story longer").Overall a good an unique contender in the Metroidvania genre, worth picking up if you're into that sort of game and don't mind the characters and amateurish aspects.","March 3, 2014","true","16.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

That has turned out to be one of the best game purchases of my life.\n\nSo, why should you buy Dust: An Elysian Tail?\n\nFirst, the beautifully hand-crafted art is to die for.\n\nSecond, as an action-packed platformer, the combat system is easy to learn but hard to master. You'll take awhile before you\nlearn how to snag achievements like That's More Like It (Successfully complete a 1000+ hit combo) and The Stuff of Legends (Earn a Four-Star Rating in EVERY Challenge Arena), which makes it that little bit sweeter when you do.\n\nThird, apart from it's main storyline, there are many side-quests and secret locations to conquer and discover. Looking to uncover them all? Don't stop at 100% completion, it goes up to 117% completion. Amen.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, is the compelling storyline. There is a fine balance between humour and drama. You'll be hooked to follow the storyline up till the grand finale.\n\nYour parents probably told you to never talk to strangers, but I need you to trust me and do yourself a favour by purchasing and playing this game.

A fun, exciting and creative idea for a game that strays away from your typical Minecraft/Infiniminer clone and utilizes an art style of its own instead of your typical "SNES Style" graphics you'd see in almost every release that other developers churn out and brings out a story line and soundtrack that you'll remember throughout your life. This game maybe another sidescroller fighting game, this game still brings out a challenge to everyone and allows you to find secrets within the game if you're up for it. If you don't feel up for a higher difficulty and rather spend more time on following the storyline, they give you the option for a lower difficulty. For best experience, play it with a controller and not a keyboard. Be careful though, if you're using a certain move too much, you'll take damage. This may be a pain for people (like me) who have a nasty habit of mashing buttons while battling creatures. I recommend this to anyone who's looking for an indie game that doesn't play off the fame of Minecraft and the likes.","September 18, 2013","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well, in my personal opinion, a great game isn't about showing off the best graphics or having mass appeal. A great game, to me anyway, is a true work of art and that's what I feel this particular one is.\n\nThe visuals and soundtrack are two of the things I find to be the most remarkable about Dust: An Elysian Tail. Gazing into the vistas and listening to the BGM almost made me feel like I was playing one of my old all time favorite games ever. Legend of Mana. I felt that every track complimented each scene well and was enjoyable to even just stop and listen to for a moment without being too distracting at the same time.\n\nThe movement and combat are fluid and easy to grasp. You rarely ever feel like the game is ever at fault for any mishaps. Combat is very fast paced and stylized like in Devil May Cry. It even has it's own little combo counter for those who like to show off their skills. And while your arsenal of attacks might feel a little limited, watching the protagonist soar back and forth across the screen in a whirlwind of blood and death never seems to get old. Level progression is also well balanced. I never felt like finding the newest upgrade for my equipment ever impacted the difficulty of the game too drastically or was ever essential for advancing in the story.\n\nSpeaking of, the story isn't too bad either. The dialogue between the protagonist and the inhabitants of Falana(the in-game world) is humorous and well written, yet there have also been a couple parts that jerked a tear out of me too. As a bonus, throughout the entire game, you'll find lots of little references and easter eggs from other games dotted out through each map, if you're a big gamer of course.  It's also refreshing to play a game that doesn't require you to make some kind of moral decision at every turn for once.\n\nIf there were anything at all I'd change about Dust, it would probably be the way the NPCs were animated. I just felt that the animations between the NPCS and protagonist clashed a little bit and while it's not a big detail, it certainly would have added some polish to an already amazing game.\n\nSo if you've got some scratch to spare and enjoy games that are more art and less mass appeal, this one is definitely worth picking up.","January 10, 2014","true","50.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Dust looks great. has amazing soundtracks, badass and smooth looking combat filled with a ton of effects, precise and well made controls, an interesting story and tons of optional content to explore.\n\nDust itself plays like a highly polished metroidvania game - you make your way through areas, later on you get new moves that allow you to discover optional paths and treasures in areas you have already visited before.\nDuring your explorations, you will meet some civilians that offer you sidequests which reward you with additional items and experience points.\nThis, ofcourse, makes Dust stronger in a variety of ways. Experience Points are self explanatory, you collect them and get level ups (level cap is 60), each level up rewards you with one skill gem that can be used to upgrade your health, attack, defense or fidget (fidget is your companion and can be treated like a magical stat).\nEvery skill can be upgraded 15 times, but the game limits you in a way that your highest skill can only be 4 skill levels higher than your lowest one (your defense is on level 1, so you can't upgrade anything else past level 5).\nThis sounds like a big limitation at first, but it helps alot by keeping the game challenging throughout all areas, otherwise you could just max out fidget and oneshot everything while ignoring all other stats.\n\nIn addition to leveling you can also get stronger by finding / crafting / buying new equipment.\nEvery area has different enemies that drop different items, and every area also has some places where you can buy and sell items. Enemies can also drop material items, those can be used to craft your own gear (if you have the required blueprints which also drop from enemies and from treasure chests).\nEquipment slots that you can fill are the following : armor, sword augment, amulet, 2x rings.\nDust only has his sword in terms of physical damage, and if you equip yourself with a sword augment you will increase your physical damage output. the other items can also provide various other bonus attributes - automated health regen, better chance for item drops, more experience gain etc.\n\nThe icing on the cake however is the absolutely amazing soundtrack. Rarely do you find a game where the soundtrack adds so much to atmosphere and fun. You enter a new area and listen to the music, and you are just like "damn, that sounds amazing". Even with Dust being an extremely colorful game, the music still manages to provide a dark and mysterious atmosphere when needed, which really makes it a joy to play. example track : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUIDOvJiJ40\n\nDepending on the difficulty level (4 available) you choose, you will get around 10-15 hours of gametime when going for 100% completion - and trust me, you will go for 100%, since the game manages to make backtracking and exploring a lot of fun.\n\nNo matter who you are, i can only recommend Dust to you. It has been the best game i have played for ages (since the release of Final Fantasy 10 i guess) and you will definitely not regret spending money on this masterfully crafted gem of a game, especially if you like metroidvania games with stylish combat and great music.\n\n10/10 would buy again.","January 9, 2014","true","20.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You will be flying around the maps (literally) swinging your sword hitting enemies. It looks awesome, feels awesome, and is just awesome in every other category. The game also gives you several combos that each have their uses. Your companion, Fidget, also gets a few kool spells that can combo with your sword swinging. To be fair, let's throw in a downside. Fidget's damage is so minute compared to Dust's damage until the very end of the game where items give crazy bonuses to her damage. I really just used her spells for style (and it does stagger enemies for a little bit so that's always helpful).\n\nThis game also looks beautiful and has great music. However, we need to address the graphics style. The characters are all anthropomorphic animals (I wanna say they most resemble a cross between a dog and a fox?) in an anime style which may turn some people off. Back to the music part, I would look forward to completing an area just to listen to the World Map music.\n\nThe game has a wide variety of settings to customize to your personal preferences and your computer specs. There were a few moments (mostly towards the end) where my frame rate took a hit but with the amount of particle effects and action going on, it was understandable and it didn't last long. The controls are solid and can be played with a keyboard/mouse or a controller. The game even allows you to switch your input method on the fly and which adjust tooltips accordingly so.\n\nNow for a quick lists of things I did not like.\n- Fidget's damage is lackluster until the latter parts of the game.\n- You will almost never be at full health. I played on the Tough difficulty and was always around ~25% health the whole game.\n- Some monsters deal absurd damage (one particular enemy will just snipe you with it's tentacle and pretty much insta-kill you). No matter how much health or defense I had, enemies just seemed to kill me in just 1 or 2 hits.\n- There are some exploding enemies which resemble Bombs from Final Fantasy which are just annoying.\n- The healing system is questionable. You have a hotkey for healing items (food) which instantly refill your health. You can spam this button as long as you have enough food to eat. It makes the game very easy if you have ready to eat.\n- Last one, I promise. In some parts of the game, the camera just seems way too close to Dust. I wouldn't mind it if the camera just moved back a little bit so I can where I am going.\n(Please note that although these are things I see as problems with the game, the pros FAR outweigh these cons. These issues will rarely take away from the game.)","January 25, 2014","true","13.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is also very user-friendly in terms of sidequests and treasure hunting, making a complete run of the game really fun. I still have a few treasures left to find, but I'm very close. The story is great, the soundtrack is great, and the characters are great. Although, I will say that some cutscenes do go on for a long time. You can skip them, but for anyone who enjoys a good story, there's a ton of dialogue in this game, despite the game being fairly short for an RPG. So, be prepared for that. If I had to say one negative about the game, it's the fact that at times, when there are a ton of enemies and attacks on screen, it's hard to keep track of where you are. This isn't a dealbreaker, but I did die a few times due to now knowing where I was. Overall, if you're looking for a very solid RPG with beautiful art, an engaging story and cathartic combat, look no further than Dust.","November 21, 2015","true","17.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Okay.\nDust surprised me with it's ongoing and expansive story, i really just thought it would be your standard 2D sidescroller (which i was perfectly ok with given it's beauty) but was gifted with this RPG-like story. The voice acting is on par with games like Final Fantasy, and the characters really resonate with emotion and believability. While the gameplay it's self isn't breaking any new ground, it is a solid sidescroller with RPG elements to the character progression. I firmly believe that if Nintendo had had the technology we have today, this is what 90% of the library for the NES would have looked like. It is an instant classic, and a game that i tell dozens of people about per day (i work in a call center and sell more Steam games than i do our own products haha. OOPS.) So take it from me, Tech Support Agent #52146, this game is for you if you ever played a NES game and smiled. Also, if you like cutesy creates.. the nimbat Fidget is just friggin adorable.","December 18, 2015","true","6.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics, for being such a simple game, are very, very well done. The characters are fun, creative, and delightfully comedic. There is also quite a bit of story to the game.\n\nThe puzzles are not the most difficult, but they are fun. The game gets progressively more challenging as time goes on, but it is still not difficult to play. So anyone that plays will have a good chance to learn the game while it is still simple enough to play.\n\nI love the story, I love the characters, and most of all I love Fidget.\n\n(Edit 1/2)\nAs of now, I've completed both Tough and Hardcore mode of the game. I'm deathly in love with the story, and more so with the ending. The challenge in Hardcore is NOT to be underestimated and it is seriously something that demands the utmost effort. The mastery trinkets at the end (the x2 Attack and x2 Defense) I would recommend the Wisdom pendant (x2 Defense) for the sake of surviving against Gaius in Hardcore mode.  Hardcore genuinely presents the most challenge I've had with a game in years.\n\nI've put in a total of about 40 hours into this game. There isn't, I confess, much replay value unless you're a challenge ♥♥♥♥♥ and you just really enjoy burning your way through a game on the hardest difficulty.\n\nThe Lightning attack is probably a bit overpowered, even in Hardcore because of how easy it is to distance-target enemies and just hide on ledges that they can't reach you on when you link it with DUST STORM.\n\nAll in all, this is my favorite game of 2015. Absolute, hands down. I highly recommend this game. I've played "big name release" titles like DMC that present fewer hours of play time than this.","December 31, 2015","true","47.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Dust offers a beautiful story and the controls are very easy (played with controller). You can either stick to the main story, do side quests or go treasure hunting. There are also a lot of easter eggs hidden in the game.\nI'd recommend to play it on 'Tough' since I started it on 'Normal' and it wasn't very difficult.\n\nHad lots of fun with the game and I'd rate it 7/10.","March 23, 2014","true","29.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And on top of that, there are extra treasures to be found and challenges to try your hand at if you feel like doing something a bit more complicated than the usual jumping around.\n\nAnd then there's the plot.

There are several different ways of playing: with an Xbox controller, keyboard, or mouse and keyboard - I went with the final choice. It does feel slightly "button mash-y," but the game still requires a level of skill and adaptation, as there are several different combos and attacks that can be used with different combinations of keys.\n\nOverall, this game is worth every penny that you would spend on it.

Characters are varied and all have some special quirks that make them all memorable. The dialogues in this game have these "quirks" just the right amount to make these characters seem more like individuals that you are interested in rather than just a squad of generic beings that you come across and smash A to skip the dialogue as fast as you can. Voice acting is great overall but at times could be heard that some of the voices weren't necessarily by a well-known professional, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but definitely noticable.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\n\nThere is not much to say about the gameplay. Quite generic "smash buttons until baddies disappear". There is a special "move" called DUST STORM that you get quite early on and that is probably what you'll be spamming for the next 8 hours or so. I played the game on NORMAL difficulty and I would suggest NORMAL for this game if you're looking to play it for the story, since it has some of the epic moments of "Oh god. I'm gonna die soon but so is the enemy" but it also makes moving between areas easier and more relaxed since you don't have to spend 10 minutes per group of enemies.\n\nGraphics: 8.5/10\n\nThis game isn't filled with a billion small particle effects or four tons of bloom and still managed to amaze me in nearly every area I went to. The cutscenes have a charming hand-drawn look to them that is beautifully executed and that makes them nothing to sneeze at.\n\nMusic: 10/10\n\nDown right amazing. The music always fit the feeling I had while playing. Epic soundtrack. Can't say much more than that.\n\nYou'll most likely get 8-12 hours out of the campaign but will probably get 20+ hours if you plan to 100% everything and get all achievements (I don't know for sure, haven't done that yet) .\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\nThis is definitely a game that I will remember and will most likely play through again in the future. I'd definitely say this is one of the best games I've played recently, and even one of the best I've ever played. Even though the gameplay aspect becomes quite frustratingly repetitive towards the end, the story kept my interest in the game very high. I definitely suggest picking this up if you're looking for an engaging story-driven game with beautiful visuals that is not too hard for a casual gamer.","January 2","true","28.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Your journey begins in a magical glade, and takes you through poorly lit ice caves, the dead forests long, snowy mountain ranges, and more. Dust, the main character, and Fidget, your trusty companion that will help you during your journey, you'll travel through a variety of interconnected stages, fighting the enemies, seeking treasures, and unlock new abilities that allow to obtain previously unreachable places. You'll meet a group of animated characters that will give you quests or continue the story in one way or another, and all of them have voice talking. While the gameplay is primarily based around navigating the levels and engaging in melee combat, there are plenty of RPG mechanics in Dust as well. Defeating enemies and solving quests will earn you experience points, and each time you level up, you can pick one of four parameters to improve. You can also craft items to help you along the journey, crafting requires both materials and a blueprint, both of which can be dropped by defeated enemies or found in chests. Opening those chests requires keys, which can be bought at a shop or found hidden in the stages.

I've always been a fan of side scrolling hack & slash platformers. When you add a good story and character progression to the mix - that makes it even better! The last time I enjoyed such a game so much was when Guardian Heroes was released for Sega Saturn in 1996. Dust: An Elysian Tail is really the same type of game, but it has its own unique qualities.\n\nDust has fancy and shiny looking animations, an interesting dark, yet sometimes humorous story and an amazing soundtrack. Those are all core components of a great game. But what impressed me the most about the game is the smoothness and agility of the gameplay and the animations. The game *never stutters*, there are no slowdowns, the controls are intuitive, everything runs exactly like it should, and it runs FAST while looking GREAT!\n\nI use a relatively high-end config for games, but I have a design flaw in my system, so I always need to be on alert and make sure it doesn't overheat. Well - not with Dust! For some reason, it seems like this game uses much less CPU and GPU resources than most other current similar games, while looking awesome! Efficiency at its best!\n\nI won't go on rambling about the awesome soundtrack, the dark (yet funny) story or about any of the other aspects of the game I love so much.

Ah, Dust...\n\nI could go on about the great writing and the beutiful world, but one is already apparent and the other would keep us here for hours, so I'll just talk about the gameplay.\n\nAt it's core, Dust is actualy a simple game. there's your standard combo, and a couple branching moves including a launch, for bringing your fights to the sky, and a grab move, both of which are inisiated during your standard combo. In other words, your entire moveset is unlocked straight off, and is suprisingly small.\n\nSo does this mean the game gets boreing fast? I suppose that depends on your own mentality. If your looking for a game with clear advancment such as unlockable skill trees, classes, and such, this is not for you. This game will get stale fast.\nIf your looking for a game about mastery, this is the game for you. Just because Dust's moveset is small does not make it easy to master.\n\nYou will spend hours upon hours honeing your ability to chain dust's various attacks together, with each passing minuet becoming more fluid and building up larger combos. You'll start learning when to group enemys up and when to pick out the straggelers. You'll learn which moves flow into the next. You'll learn about dodge-canceling. You'll learn about how to effectivly use the dust storm. You'll learn when to use Fidget's magic, untill eventualy you'll be wracking up 1000+ combos without batting an eye.\n\nDust is, at it's core, a game about mastery. Thats all there really is to be said.","January 3, 2014","true","18.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game looks really nice. Even though there is one weapon, you are able to do a few different moves and fidgit attacks. The game is metroid styled and you will have to return to some areas if you want to get the extra stuff. But just have fun hacking and slashing your way through.\n\nThe voice acting isn't too bad and the characters look nice. The soundtrack is beautifull. It's really great.\n\nThough the game isn't that long and there isn't really a replay value. It's worth picking up for a good experience. If you don't have anything against furries atleast.. Because the game is full of them.\n\nI would pick it up when you get the chance. Maybe during a sale if you really prefer. But no matter when you pick it up.. You should pick it up if you enjoy a metroid styled game that looks amazing. Just hack 'n' slash to the end\nBeautiful action RPG - interesting combat style, great writing and storyline, and lots of terrific side quests and puzzles. Beautiful artwork, scenery and music. Combat can get a little bit repetitive, but I'm a big level grinder, so that may be why. Can't wait for the sequel!You're Dust, a mysterious being without memories of his past. While you fight your way through monsters, you'll eventually discover what you are, where you came from and where your path will lead you.\nWill you be a righteous soul or an evil spirit?\n\nOkay, you won't make any big choices throughout the game, so ignore the last sentence, i just liked the sound of it ^^\n\n"Dust - An Elysian Tail" is best described as an action-rpg-platformer i guess.\nYou'll jump and fight your way through monsters with your sword through multiple levels, gain new abilities while you progress and level yourself up while finding/and or crafting (which is kept very simple) new gear to make you even stronger.\n\nThe graphics are beautifully drawn and very colourful. The 2 main characters, Dust and Fidget, his sidekick, are pretty memorable and their dialogues have some decent humor in it.\n\nI really enjoyed it and would recommend you'd give it a try, if you like this sort of genre.This is definitely worth a playthrough unless you're one of those people that's had a terrible childhood where your parents abused you and you weren't allowed to watch awesome 90's cartoons like Bucky O'Hare and Ducktales, instead you grew up watching That's So Raven and other junk which make you go OMG FURRY this is! Anyway...\n\nThis game is a side scrolling fighting story-driven game that does a lot of things good and a few things merely ok. Everyone harps on it being 'furry' but I think that's just kneejerk reaction. It's just got animal characters in it. If this is furry, so is Ducktales. No one will be yiffing anything. The combat is fun, but does wear a little thin near the end thanks to not much variety. You have a sidekick who is a squeaky voiced flying mouse bat fox creature, but she actually ends up being not annoying (at least in my experience) because she's a bit sarcastic and tends to be overly genre-aware break the 4th wall to crack jokes. The story feels a little rushed in places, but not bad. From what I understand, the dev basically had to work 20 hour days for a couple months to crank the game out, and while I can see some rough patches overall it's a pretty fun experience.\n\nThe best way to describe it without spoilers is if you combined the fantastical art style and platforming of Earthworm Jim games with the gameplay and character advancement of modern 2D Castlevania games, plus a bit of Klonoa thrown in for character design and story. Dust takes all of those elements and makes a very satisfying experience out of them.\n\nAlso Dust has one killer Camel toe so there's that.\n\nMy score for Dust: An Elysian Tail is:\n4.5 Dust Camel / 5 Toes","February 20, 2014","true","7.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The beautiful music, painstakingly detailed environments, and passionate voice acting blew me away. Then Fidget and all 304% of her adorable-osity sealed the deal. At first the story didn't really spark much interest--being the typical "all powerful mysterious warrior with amnesia traversing the land helping it's people while trying to regain his dark and mysterious memory"-- but as it went on it started to pull me in. It's best described as a cross between Okami and Rayman Origins with a little bit of Kingdom Hearts sprinkled on top. (Pros and cons below.)\n\nPros:\n-Beautifully orchestrated music\n-Painfully detailed environments and weather effects\n-Very touching and emotionally impacting. Feelings of pain, sorrow, love--concepts of life and death are handled maturely like they should be and conveyed to the player\n-Excellent, passionate voice acting\n-Exciting and tense moments\n\nNeutral:\n-The humor is 50-50. There are some funny jokes. There are some dry jokes.\n-Storyline may or may not provide the player with much interest.\n-The difficulty fluxuates. Some areas are very easy, some areas suddenly ♥♥♥♥ you.\n\nCons:\n-A bit on the short side\n-Typical hack'n slash with redundant combat\n-VERY few combos to use; especially for a hack n'slash\n-Hordes of respawning enemies can be a bit overwhelming and annoying at times\n-Boss battles are complete jokes. Normal enemies are more life threatening than the bosses\n-Practically no replay value\n\nConclusion:\n-6.5/10. While the gameplay and hack'n slash elements are regretably limited, this game is a work of art. It's a 2D game that has infinitely more heart and soul put into it than most overrated 3D Micheal Bay games out today. It is TRULY a work of art and deserves as much support and recognition as it can get for its BEAUTY instead of gameplay which unfortunately is below par. Of course artistry isn't for everyone. This game is not for everyone. But that doesn't stop it from being truly beautiful.","January 7, 2014","true","22.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamthehatred/recommended/236090/","iamthehatred","Ibn Battuta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamthehatred/","258 products in account","So I got this based entirely on the recommendation of multiple friends.\n\nWhen I first saw the rating of E10, I figured they were out of their minds (At this point, I was starting the game, so I guess you can gather how much faith I have in my friends in total). They weren't.\n\nKeep in mind that action/platformer is about my least favorite genre ever. Happily, Dust doesn't go the route of making the platforming an exercise in pixel-perfection, but rather one of thinking ahead and planning. For me, it's much more satisfying to fail five times and know that there's still three routes I've not tested, than to fail fifteen times because I'm jumping a frame too soon.\n\nNow, the combat isn't overly complex, and it's very easy to get excessively powerful. But that's OK. I play most of my games on normal, at least at first. For this one, I felt pretty secure in adding a difficulty level. It doesn't QUITE match the game to my skill level then, but it made the game "difficult" enough that I could die if I stopped paying attention to my health. No idea how normal plays, but Tough feels about right for me anyway.\n\nThe game draws you in with humor, but the real lasting attraction is that the game handles its characters as if they were actually people. It's not quite novel quality characterization here (let's be honest, very few characters have enough lines to develop much), but it's a refreshing change from action games where an NPC's toughness is directly related to how much profanity they can use.\n\nOn the whole, I recommend this game.","July 4, 2014","true","48.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I don't mean that in terms of grinding for gear, like in WoW, but in terms of spending a little bit of time unfolding the story... if you like a deep story little twists, and grippnig emotion. That is where this game shines, even if it takes a little to get into (maybe 2h before the story gets interesting).\n\nThe other noteworthy thing to mention is the soundtrack, it's quite beautiful. No one else seems to talk about it here, so I wanted to make sure that it gets a mention.\n\n*yet to complete this game, but I spent a fair bit of time offline with it, thus the "short" amount of play time.\n\n***\nOK, I have 99% completed this game - with only 1 achievement outstanding, I wish that I had known this earlier. If you want to get all achievements in this game, start it on "tough" difficulty. I had decided that I wanted to 100% this game by about 1.5h - and didn't realise this was one of the requirements. So now i have another 11h of gameplay ahead of me to replay the entire game, just to get this one achievement.\n*The difference between 100% on Casual vs Tough is 17h vs 20h, if you play it through to completion the first time. it's probably more rewarding, too.\n\nThe only complaint that I have about the game, is that you cannot skip the ending credits. Seriously.\n\nYou get warned before the final boss battle that there is "no turning back once you go past this point" so you have to go and get everything in the world before you face him, if you want to 100% (actually about 117-120% I believe ingame).\n\nIt's not a bad entry into the RPG series, as you always feel like you are progressing, never like you are grinding. actually, I levelled up faster than the enemies progressed, so by endgame, I was OP 1hitting almost everything, and 2shotting the hardest minions-type enemies in the game.","September 26, 2014","true","19.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Why you ask? You probably havent but I am going to tell you anyway... This game is so beautifully done that I felt by the end of it it deserved the time to read the names behind it. I really can't find anything to fault with this game. It is, simply put, charming in its delivery.\n\nThe characters are great, the story is very well delivered and keeps you invested in the what is going on while giving adequete spaces between story for action and mini puzzles.\n\nThe combat, while simple, also has a degree of complexity that does take some time to master but when mastered makes you feel like such a bad*ss while also punishing your mistakes (keep in mind I only played this on the hardest difficulty setting and quite frankly, at times, it was a f*cking nightmare. It may well be quite easy on the easiest setting).\n\nLevel design is very well thought out with a great mix of miniture puzzles (to find loot and 'friends'), hazards and a great assortment of enemies to go through.\n\nThere is even a simple crafting system and an RPG style levelling system that is also VERY well done as it is simple yet effective in what it does. What does it do? Gives you what I would call 'Freedom Control'. Your free to choose the way you are controlled. 'This armour is the best you can get at the moment (controlled)... now would you like to buy that, craft it by hunting enemies for materials by grinding or buy the materials needed?... Your call chuckles.". It works very brilliantly. Even with the leveling system for Dust. While you can be a powerhouse hitter and kill everything in a few hits, you cant be SUCH a heavy hitter that you die in one hit yourself.\n\nI would recommend this game to everyone. Not that I think everyone will enjoy it on the level I did but because it is so well done that it deserves to be played by lovers of games. It is masterfully done.","October 14, 2014","true","16.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I love this game for many reasons: the music is absolutely amazing, the background and characters are beautifully rendered and react to wind, rain and fighting, the combat has about 6-7 combos in total but you have so much freedom of movement that it feels like your pulling off 15-20 string combos, and the story is amazingly compelling. The sidekick you have through the game, Fidget The Nimbat, made me laugh many times and is a really good asset in combat. The combat rewards you for having long unbroken combo chains (there is an sidequest that has you get a 1000 hit combo) and reminds me of something Platinum Games would make.\n\nThere are many little nods and easter eggs in the game from all of gaming history. They can be usuable items to the merchant to treasures you find in the world. The game really rewards exploration with items and money and health upgrades.\n\nThe one weakness Dust: An Elysian Tail suffers from is the boss battles. It is usually one enemy that you fight , and it becomes trivial because you dodge their attacks and chain combos on them when there just standing there. The boss battles can be overlooked if you get really interested in the story.\n\nI would reccommend you play this game of the "Tough" difficulty, because normal is too easy for most people. The "Hardcore" difficulty is best saved for a second playthrough because you take more damage and enemies take less damage.\n\nI cannot reccommend this game enough to anyone that calls themselves a gamer. If you can get over the fact that the characters are anthromorphic animals and it is metroidvania styled , you will see a compelling story, beautiful design, music that is on par with Super Mario Galaxy, and a combat system that allows you to chain combos indefinitely.","October 29, 2014","true","39.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It’s full of secrets to uncover, areas to explore and enemies to kill in fantastically over-the-top ways. Getting a 1000-hit combo during a fight with dozens of badguys is not only immensely satisfying, it’s also almost effortless.\n\nThe story may not be that unique or special, but it’s charming enough. The graphics are lush, and wonderfully animated, betraying how it was all done by a single individual’s hard work over the last three years. But the real soul of Dust is the confident combat system, which struts up to you the moment you start playing, takes you by the hand and encourages you to have fun. It’s not Bayonetta levels of sophistication , but it doesn’t have to be. The combination attacks are simple but empowering, launchers take you into the air with ease, and the Dust Storm (a kind of magic attack with several spells to uncover) has you stun-locking herds of enemies, experience points exploding around you like New Years fireworks.\n\nIf games are a dialogue between the player and the game’s creator, then playing Dust is like sitting down with an old friend who’s back in town, full of fresh stories to tell and eager to reminisce with you about the good times.","September 22, 2014","true","3.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game at the beginnning seems like a really child-game: nice, vibrant colours, quite easy combat, and the usualy quest: save the village. But the story turns darker and darker, with moral conflicts, not the usual "black or white" characters, and a great story starts to unfold. Currently I'm at 71% of the game, with 11 hour gameplay!

However, it successfully mixes in some RPG elements such as levelling, gearing and crafting, always keeping everything very simple. The system is enjoyable and the combats as well with all the combos and abilities.\n\nLet's drop the line "story sucked, it was cliché" guys, it is getting cliché. There is at least one particular (very important!) non-cliché moment also. Some years ago, I would have been ashamed to admit that I've giggled many times with Fidget and that now I want a flying bat-cat pet, but I'm too old to care about sounding mature ("unleash the rainbow unicorns!" I say). Her humour IS CHILDISH but somehow in a good way, hard to explain. Voice acting was great in my opinion. Some dramatic moments are too short, but I guess it is a good compromise or else it could turn out annoying.\n\nI really disliked the design of the last 3 (of 6) areas, the background makes it hard to focus on the main character. Specially the 6th area, you simply CANNOT see him, and in the 5th I disabled weather effects. Otherwise, exploring the areas is fun.\n\nThe game has 4 difficulties, and on the 3rd it was not too bad (except the very beginning). Some of the achievements are challenging, but not overly frustrating. You can finish the game with 115% completion, though there isn't an achievement for that (do you need one? we don't need one). You can find characters from other modern games locked in cages in secret areas *achievements bell rings*. That's some sort of homage to the modern classics, instead of the cliché "oh, I'm gonna pay homage to those games that everybody already paid homage to!!".\n\nYes, you read it right.\nNo homage to Mario.\nNo homage to Link or Kirby.\nSuck.\nIt.\nCliché.\nHaters.\n\nSpoiler: I almost cried when I saw The Kid from Bastion and Tim from Braid. Right in the feels, I loved those games!\n\nAlso, the guy did this on his own.

This miracle is a fruit of a single man's labour (Dean Dodrill), and this game just has everything. Combat, story, drama, squeeky cute pokemon-thingy (Fidget, the nimbat), a mysterious sword-wielder hero - sadly striken by amnesia. The game at the beginnning seems like a really child-game: nice, vibrant colours, quite easy combat, and the usualy quest: save the village. But the story turns darker and darker, with moral conflicts, not the usual "black or white" characters, and a great story starts to unfold. Currently I'm at 71% of the game, with 11 hour gameplay! (According to Steam 22: I died hellova lots of times at the early parts, Though difficulty not so forgiving)  Oh,  and while easy mode makes you heal to max hp every checkpoint, at higher difficulties the game is not just a breeze. Difficulty scales quite well, you need to pay attention to your moves on higher difficulty levels.\nTLDR: I DO recommend this game.

D:AET is a crowning achievement of a game that is made primarily by one person. Beautiful graphics with anthromorphic characters that harken back to the 90s era of gaming. Looks like furry lust, but it's not. Gameplay is a mix between Caslevania and Odin Sphere. Combat, though is a little repetitive after a while (projectiles change things up for a bit, but not for long). I hate how the game is deceptively easy, yet on tough difficulty, enemies can nearly one shot you. This isn't a huge problem since you find too many health items (perhaps this is deliberate), but this leads to a carefree "attack relentlessly and heal when you're hit gameplay" instead of a methodical approach like the best action games. I don't think this will bother most other gamers though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/perplexingPariah/recommended/236090/","perplexingPariah","perplexingPariah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/perplexingPariah/","115 products in account","The story of this game is around Dust, an anthropomorph that wakes up in the middle of a forest with no memories. You travel the lands trying to figure who you are while also helping out the people you meet along the way. I think the game focuses the most on its art and its story and although I don't have a harsh opinion on its game mechanic, I feel like there could've been more than just reworked art to same monsters-types.\n\nCombat & Control\nThe combat system is based on a series of combos that is very easy to learn and different types of monsters & abilities are introduced along the way. The combos are easy to learn and pretty repetitive, but I didn't mind. Abilities were introduced throughout the game and are essential in being able to go back to previous maps to get previously obtainable treasure while also necessary to move ahead. I used an XBOX controller so it was a pretty easy ride for me and I liked playing this game when I just wanted to sit back in my chair and bash some buttons. The jumping was a bit annoying at first because I think it didn't have a "push down longer to jump for longer" mechanic so every jump was the same distance, even if you would give just a slight love tap to the jump button. Overall, I didn't mind the repetition of the combos and the new abilities   kept the combat and exploring the world a bit more interesting.\nAs for the monsters, there were a lot of variety but there was definitely some "reskinning" going on as you enter different zone. For example, there was a type of monster that would explode if you got to close and in another "snowy" zone, it was just redrawn blue with snow on it. I thought it was cute, but it did leave something more to be desired in fighting new types of foes. Still, I'd like to emphasize that there was still a lot of variety and there's no harm in using the same monster-type at a higher skill area.\n\nWorld Exploration\nAlthough there might have been some reskinning, I think I was able to look past it because each zone usually brought a new way to explore the world or puzzles that you had to solve to get the "treasures" scattered across the land. Like I mentioned earlier, you get introduced to new abilities and these abilities help you reach new places. For example, in the beginning of the game, Fidget points out a wall of vines that you have not yet learned how to climb and suggests we come back later. There are definitely some treasures that you would not be able to reach without certain learned abilities and would have to come back later to get them. And if you don't want to get them, that's fine too. The treasures are not vital in the end-game and are only for bragging rights and exploring the world. You also have to use these abilities and navigate around the map to get to the next zone so each area isn't just a mindless journey of button mashing.\n\nArt (Voice Acting, Graphics, Music)\nI've heard some people get really annoyed with the voice acting, and I can see where they're coming from. Fidget, your Navi-like companion, has a pretty squeaky voice and can be a little obnoxious to some and I found myself a little annoyed at some of the characters myself... Nonetheless, I think there was a lot of effort put into narrating pretty much every single line that is ever spoken in this game and I took the time to listen and read along. The backgrounds were pretty fantastic as well and there was just so much love put into every zone! I really loved the music as well and most them are very memorable! The only con is that there is just so much going on with aesthetic sometimes and there were some glitches with areas that were in complete darkness.\n\nStory\nHey I admit it - I cried a bit and not just once! I can't really talk too much about the story without spoiling so I'll say this: they do have some cliche stories. Some "ideas" and plots didn't really resonate well with me either (e.g. Dust reacted differently than I expected to certain events, some plots didn't make too much sense with me, there were some missing plotholes...) Regardless, I thought it was quaint. Someone more critical than me might think the story was pretty sloppy... but who knows!\n\nBasically, this game isn't perfect but that didn't stop me from finishing it and obsessing over the hidden treasures... oh the hours I wasted! I suppose I'd recommend this game, but it may not be some people's cup of tea.","January 8, 2015","true","16.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NEVELS/recommended/236090/","NEVELS","SLEVEN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NEVELS/","805 products in account","Upon completing the game in about 70 hours or so on its hardest difficually. It gave me a fair and just battle through the entire game. After going through countless waves upon waves of enemies, improving my abilities and skills therein I was overcoming obstacles left and right while upgrading my character to his peak conditions. Now a few things I gotta say for prase and complaints.\n\n1. The game pulls off a very tough challenge in its battles where every boss or major enemy appears in a specific battle arena. You have to be observant while fighting these enemies and plan your means of attack. Esp. on the Toughest challenge mode. I cannot stress how satisfying this game is with how it brought out in battling hordes of enemies without slowdown at all!\n\n2. The Story is simple. Filled with rememberable characters. Though if I had to say a bit more with this short game it is all focused onto your main character. Nothing more. Sure you may do some side quest to help some of the worlds citizens to collect something here and there. But more or less it is fun and enjoyable experince.\n\n3. The time spent into this game is mostly grinding and Exploration because of my playthrough I was stupid (smart?) enough to play my first playthrough on the toughest setting. I died countless upon countless of times and over and over again I had to see the loading game screen. There are save panels applenty and with the right equips you can overcome any challenges. Just be sure to have the reflexes.\n\n4.At the end of the game I was engrossed in the world they developed. I haven't felt this way since well... Sonic the Hedgehog started development. There is always a hankering inside my mind that this isn't the end. No it is just the beginning of great things to come. If there was a prequal or a sequal to this game. My bet is that it will be day one purchase! Just make the game a bit more.....Substancial and more understanding. That is all! Props to the creators for this wonderful game!\nFrom Harvey Storm AKA Sleven","July 8, 2014","true","129.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dudebropyro/recommended/236090/","dudebropyro","Dudebro Pyro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dudebropyro/","29 products in account","Honestly, if there was a neutral option I'd use it. However, there isn't, and I decided to lean against recommending this game, if only because I feel that, while not bad, the game is certainly highly overrated already.\n\nYou can read some 12,000 reviews raving about how awesome this is, so let me summarize here why I'm not recommending this game to all my friends like 96% of the other reviewers would have me do:\n\n- Gameplay: standard action platformer, really. You gain some extra abilities as you progress; however, they are almost all direct upgrades to a special skill you can perform. To my knowledge, there are no sidegrades (at least none that you get in the first 11 or so hours - I haven't finished the game yet), and all your core abilities and attacks remain the same. The enemies get harder, of course, but since your stats increase too, I haven't felt much of a difficulty curve. There are select few special enemies that can be interesting to fight, but they are found seldom and between each notable encounter, you're going to have to kill hundreds upon hundreds of grunts, super grunts, tough grunts, grunty grunts...\n\n- More on gameplay, but regarding the platformer aspect: it really isn't the focus of the game. As such, while there are some instances of interesting level design, most of it just functions as terrain for the fighting. ...And now you see my problem: since the fighting (at least on non-hard difficulties) basically involves repeating a perma-stunlock combination of moves over and over until everything on-screen dies, there isn't much to do in this game.\n\n- The story: ah yes, the story. It's what ties the game together; what makes plowing through waves of grunts worth it, to get to the boss battle and get a cutscene and get on with the story. Unfortunately, the story, as far as I have seen it, is highly cliche. I can't really comment on the entire main plotline, since I haven't finished the game, but here's what I have seen:\n- - - You start in some sacred clearing in a random forest, with amnesia. What an original plot device! I'm sure the game won't be about the main character trying to regain their memories while getting mixed up in a quest they don't understand helping people they don't know, which is actually very much tied into what the character did before losing their memories, only to emerge changed and a better person than they were before!\n- - - Oh wait, that's exactly what happens.\n\n- On the same note as the story, the sidequests are all extremely cliche. You know the usual model of the protagonist just going around, having everyone unload all of their worries on him, and then going to find various monster loot, misplaced keys, and random trivialities that really have no consequence whatsoever in the bigger picture? Yeah, that's exactly how every single sidequest in this game is like. Back when Zelda et al. did it 20 years ago, it was fine, not only because the technology of the time didn't allow anything too complex, but also because a) this particular format hadn't been beated to death yet, and b) there wasn't really much precedent for better quests, so there was nothing to take example from. But this is a 2013 game, it can do better! Or, apparently, not.\n\n- This was made by a single person. While some people talk about how this has let them put their all into the game, unhampered by a marketing department or disagreements in the team, etc., in my opinion this also has a downside: there is a limit to the creativity of a single person, and I really feel like a second or third pair of eyes helping develop the game could have only made it better, and a lot of the aforementioned problems stem from this.\n\nCONCLUSION: this game is alright. I got it at something like 90% off, and more or less enjoyed the 10 or so hours I put into it. It's definitely not one of those horrible indie games that seem to be built solely for marketing (and screaming "Look! I'm a new and innovative indie game, unhampered by the conventions of the gaming industry, and I'm definitely not a poorly-executed cash-grabbing attempt!") and not actual entertainment. But if it's not on sale, I still think it's not worth the money.","March 15","false","11.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

But besides that it kind of sucked. The voice acting is terrible, the dialog is cheesy and the overall story is very cliche. The gameplay was fun at first but since the fighting doesn't really change from the beginning till the end it gets pretty boring and can be explioted way too easily.\n\nAlso I swear the skill tree is completely pointless. You can only level up your highest levels four skill higher than your lowest level forcing you to level up your character evenly and making it impossible to make a character that specializes in one skill. And the enemies level up their defense at the same rate as you do so increasing skills like attack don't really do much. And the enemies attack levels up just as fast as yours meaning the only thing increasing your health does is to make your healing items less effective.","March 9, 2014","false","20.9"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","15","28","0","0"

If you have a few hours to spare, you should give it a go. The visuals and music are both stunning, and I may even buy the soundtrack some time soon. The controls are pretty smooth (although pinpoint platforming sometimes gets a little troublesome), and while there are not that many combos to pull off, the battles are still fun and they make you look amazing as you pull off hundreds of chains and fly across the screen whilst tearing apart enemies. The characters and voice acting may be a bit cheesy, but I think it fits the overall style of the game and I found myself liking the interactions between them (primarily the two main characters). There are several side quests and challenge areas to do, so the possibility to deviate from the main storyline is there, if you like those kinds of things. I liked the number of side quests because it was not an overwhelming amount that caused me to lose sight of the main progression. If you're looking for a visually and audibly stunning hack-and-slash side-scroller, you should definitely try this game out!","January 2, 2014","true","36.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Almost could say it inspires some to get into drawing.\n\nDon't let all the talking anthro animal stuff fool you, it's like An American Tail, movies like that of which could have been some inspriation to having these type of characters.  So it's not because the creator is some furry or furries in general, just don't.  Don't let that one single word sneer you away from this game.  You'll regret it, heavily.\n\nIt's hard to give this a 9/10, it's just so damn well made and entirely perfect, including the port to pc.  A quick note about the pc port. It's amazing what can be done if you take your time doing it, not rushing it like some of these major ass♥♥♥♥ companies do today with their half-♥♥♥♥♥ ports to pc from console.\n\n10/10 solid, it deserves that well.","August 17, 2014","true","29.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've never completed a game so fast in my life.  Every spare time I had (since I've just finished my exams and am now on my break) was spent sitting in front of my computer playing this game.\n\nI love the artwork, as hand-drawn graphics had always appealed to me.  I also love the soundtrack, as it's equal parts mellow and epic, depending on the situation.  The gameplay is nice, easy to pick up, a bit hard to master (I've gotten quite frustrated at some of the platforming, took a lot of tries).  Overall, it's a really nice game, and I kind of wished it had been a bit longer, but it was a very enjoyable ride.\n\nAlso, love the story.  It's nice to see a break from the usual "good guys always wins no matter what" pattern in other games.  I also love the little play on words, and of course, the sassiness in the dialogues.","December 4, 2014","true","26.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The animations are wonderful, and there's so much fun to be had while slashing down enemies and finding loot around. The story itself is well developed and has several sidequests which make sense, and while there aren't dozens of them, they provide several hours of gameplay along with the main storyline.\n\nGraphic (and sound/music) wise this game is really well done, mostly in a way that makes it fun to watch and play through rather than for sheer beauty, but overall all of the characters and the places are well designed and stand out perfectly. If anything, sometimes the gameplay is repetitive, but that has mostly to do with the platform design rather than with the plot or the level design (imho), as the 2D nature of the game has some limits, but in the end the game makes really a lot to overcome each of its dimensional limits.\n\nFor that matter, the amount and quality of both combos and movements of Dust make it fun to even just watch the character jumping in the air!\nIn fact, while fighting you can also count on Fidget abilities, and some rings/pendants/etc greatly improve Fidget's combat skills, up to a point that lets you draw the fight style that suits you the most.\n\nRPG wise, this game allows you to craft several items but most of the crafting makes use of loot you can only find while killing enemies. That in turn makes for a solid system (as much as some backtracking) as it pushes you to play each area throughout, instead of buying most of what you need from a merchant.\n\nOverall, a really good game and especially a really good 2D platformer (with rpg elements), a good plot and a fighting system that makes for a lot of fun.\n\n","December 5, 2014","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Plays kind of like a sidescroller version of Ys (another good series if you don't know it; Oath in Felghana was especially great), has a relatively lengthy story, lots of sidequests (20~?) and if you like speedrunning, this game has a lot of tricks to master (currently mastering speedrunning myself on this game; dust storm op!).  10/10 would recommend to anyone.  Has difficulties ranging from Casual (easy, enemies do less damage amongst a plethora of things) to Hardcore (pretty hard, lots of things can one shot you, ai is much more difficult, and as stated a plethora more of things) and will keep you going for a while.

I'm so glad i did, though.\n\nNow the actual review:\nThis game is what first looks like a MetroidVania, beat-em up, adventure game. But it's way more than that. The entire game is pure epic. The gameplay is intense and fun, the story is eventful and heart-pounding, the cast of characters are ALL lovable (I <3 Fidget), and the music is outstanding!\n\nThe biggest thing i love about this game though, is especially the story and the characters. All of the characters have unique personality (Dust is cool, Fidget is childishly cute, Ahrah is the serious one of the main trio, and even the each NPCs have unique personalities) The dialogues in the game are hilarious, and have many memorable and quotable moments. It feels like watching a movie (spoilers,  There are some anime-like cutscenes, following the original 'Elysian Tail' movie style. Both the movie and this game is the same creator  )\n\nI love this game, i love the people behind it (one person doing the sole programming and graphics for over 4 years of development, plus music composer group, and voice actors)\nI only wish the game had some sorta replay value (besides replaying the game in a higher difficulty), but overall, this game was a wonderful experience.\n\nGet this game, it's awesome, i demand it!","January 13, 2014","true","47.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no natural health regeneration, and there are no inns or any other sort of place that you can go to restore your health. Completing a level does not heal you. The ONLY way is by buying health items from a shop. 20 health costs 80 gold. Sure, you can buy an item that restores 40 health for 160 gold, or 120 health for 480 gold, but there is no discount as you go up. No incentive to buy better healing items. No reason to increase your max health until enemies literally one shot you.\n\nMoreover, the amount of damage the enemies do doesn't seem fair. They either do virtually no damage, or they do a TON of damage, but not much in between. So you are either just flying through an area virturally ignoring all the enemies, or you are using up all your health items in a five minute period.\n\nThe voice acting isn't of the best quality either, which the exception of the main characters. When I talk to someone, I don't hear the character's voice. I hear a person trying to do a silly voice. As I talk to more characters, I can hear what is clearly just a small handfull of voice actors trying to do a bunch of different silly voices.\n\nBecause of flaws like these and more, I wouldn't give the game a perfect score. But there is enough about it that IS done well that I will give it a positive score.","May 26, 2014","true","21.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I thought this would limit the gameplay, making it boring at some point, but it didn't. The game is relatively short if you decide to do the campaign only, and becomes longer if you decide to do the subquest. You can find equipment to upgrade your sword & be more competitive in fights. The game itself is really easy, if you wish for a challenge, directly jump to the hardcore difficulty, where you really die easily if you gets hit (my advice : don't try to speedrun it, use combos & dodge as much as possible).\n\nGraphically : it's a cel-shaded style plat-former, who really take inspiration into Don Bluth's An American Tail animated movie in terms of artstyle (they even made the same pun). At first I thought it would be a problem since I'm really not a fan of the furry genre (due to what the Internet did to it, mostly) but it really only took inspiration in the Don Bluth movie style and never try to sexualize the characters like you can see many games do whenever they try to add androgynous animal characters. So yeah, I really felt I was watching an old animated movie, with the same kind of message Don Bluth himself would be able to convey (about war, destruction of nature, etc...)\n\nThe story is cute, it's nothing great but it's very cute, very well acted, and I appreciate the voice actors' effort in the play.\n\nOne big plus for this game is the music : the music is absolutely fantastic, and one of my favourite soundtrack in videogame's history. Not even kidding.\n\n\nIt's charming, it's fun, it's pretty. The music is beautiful.\n\nIt is a wonderful tail... I mean tale.","December 28, 2013","true","27.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The initial story premise relies on piecing together the identity of the amnesiac main title character and what lead him to suffer from amnesia, honestly there's nothing hugely interesting about it. The standard story structure is followed and you meet some decent characters on the way but there's nothing hugely memorable compared to other indie titles on the market. However Dust: An Elysian Tail's biggest strength is its gameplay. Dust provides a nice hack and slash styled combat system that has RPG elements in that you can upgrade your abilities and wear specific items of clothing to increase stats further, the whole system gives depth to the game as you hunt for the best loot. Also the combat flows very naturally in thanks to the gorgeous animations that never hampers the pace of the game, allowing it to become rewarding and engaging. The only minor quibble is that it can sometimes become rather limited as you are tied with one weapon along with three magic assist abilities, as a result the game can drag especially if you're revisiting areas for a specific quest. The games presentation is stellar top to bottom with the voice acting being fairly good (Even if Dust himself can sound like he's trying too hard to be emotional at times), the background and character design's being stellar and the performance running smoothly without a hitch. Overall if you're looking for a fun action RPG to get into then Dust excels over many of its counterparts and can easily provide you with 8-10 hours of fun gameplay.","July 9, 2013","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's everything but easy to write a review to this game.\nTo be honest, if this game had been published from a major company, I might have been disappointed. But it is an Indie-Game (and the first one Noogy ever made), so naturally one cannot compare it to a major release.\n\nAll in all it is a really great game, hands down. ;)\n\nNow enough talk, let's get to the likes and dislikes.\n\nLikes:\nabsolutely gorgeous artwork and animations\nan overwhelming soundtrack\nsmooth and action oriented gameplay\ngreat voice acting\nan absolutely cute and funny sidekick\nfunny innoendos about video game oddities (Mysterios Wall Chicken!)\nunintrusive and funny 4th wall breaks\nnice refferences to other games  (Mysterios Wall Chicken!)\nperhaps not innovative but nevertheless interesting aproach on crafting and trading (increasing the trader's assortment by selling new items to them)\nthe Mysterious Wall Chicken!\nDislikes:\nlevel grinding and item/gold farming is way too easy\nFidget becomes way too overpowered (I stopped using her powers at the meadows to keep the game halfway challenging, although I cranked up the difficulty before)\nspeaking of challenge: the first and the last boss fights were the only ones which were challenging to me, the latter perhaps only because I didn't use fidget\nevery health item stronger than the Mysterious Wall Chicken! is a bad bargain to buy (using 2 chickens heals 160 hp for 600 coins, the hot cocoa heals 160 hp for 640 coins, the birthday cake has an even worse cost-benefit ratio, so you end up swallowing countless chickens because it is the cheapest way to heal - but Mysterious Wall Chicken FTW!, so why should I care? :D )\n\nAbout the story... well, I'm actually a bit torn appart about it.\nYes, it follows quite common tropes and is per se not that innovative, but it IS a good story and keeps you interested, if you alow yourself to delve into it.\nBut there are two major drawbacks about the story.\nThe first and the most disappointing is that major plot elements are revealed waaaaaayyyy too early. In Aurora Ginger tells you that you're dressed like a royal assassin - first half of the plot revealed, and shortly after someone tells you about a "twin soul" - not sure if Fuse allready talks about it, but Lady Tethys most certainly does and thus revealing the other half of the plot.\nSo roughly after the first third of the game you can allready figure out what is going on, only the "when, where and why" is kept a secret until the near end.\n\nThe second drawback about the Story is that "it seems to be a bit shallow". That's one thing often critizised at negative reviews about Dust. Well, i dare to disagree, hence the quotation marks.\nI think the story itself is not that shallow (at least not more shallow than the Halo-Storyline *duck and cover*), but it is told in a shallow fashion. The arcs of suspense are boiled down to short cutscenes with only a few lines of dialouge and major plot twists are given away early and in a way as if they were only a negligibility.\nSo I say the Story would gain more positive reviews if it was told in a different way and revealed in a "different order".\n\nWell, yes, this was quite a bit of a breakdown, pointing out more negative features than positive ones.\n\nBut: Every positive feature mentioned outweights the negative ones by far.\n\nIt is an absolutely great game and mindblowingly detailed - especially if you take into consideration that this is the first game ever released by Noogy. Thats why I give this Game a thumbs up - I absolutely love it!\n\nOh and in case you haven't noticed yet:\nI friggin' LOVE the mysterious wall chicken !!! :D","September 2, 2014","true","42.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't recommend playing the game on anything lower than the "tough" difficulty for anyone that has played any fighting brawler-like game before.\n\nI highly recommend the game to anyone, it's well worth the price placed.","December 6, 2013","true","24.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat could see more variants in attacks and longer chain combos, including more types of projectiles to be shot. Story is captivating and the dialogue is humourous and enjoyable.

And let me tell you, this game is worth all of it and more. Humble Hearts, is a one man game company founded by Dean Dodrill, and Dean  spent four years of his life putting all his soul into developing this enticing work of art. And i love him for it. When i got into this game it reminded me personally of Castlevania, in the way the the hud displays your hp and just the overall darting in and out of combat to ensure you take the least amount of damage possible. Speaking of that, the combat is engaging and fast paced making for a great challenge, with parries, dodging, and even some combo abilities that make use of your adorable companion, Fidget. It is absolutely fantastic to see a single man put such depth, and beauty into a single game. Something that big tier gaming companies i think seem to be forgetting this days. The fact that i can go on side quests, buy items at a shop, and craft more epic items at a blacksmith. Even the leveling system is reminiscent of the rpg i used to play, very simplistic but still adds a great deal to the game. The soundtrack is vibrant in the mind and compliments the atmosphere and area around you very well. I would definitely consider checking this game out. Even after when the price goes back up to $15.00. It will still be a wonderful game that you should to add to your library.","December 28, 2013","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dust: An Elysian Tail was made by one man, and the game has the quality of that you see with teams of hundreds working passionately on a project.\n\nThe game itself is a 2D Sidescroller inspired heavily by games like Metroid and Castlevania. You will find yourself exploring a fairly large open world, looking for items, money, and powers which will allow you to explore areas that were locked to you before. The aesthetic style of this game is truly amazing as well. The use of varied colors really helps the world and its residents come to life in ways rarely seen in games today. I would find myself staying in areas long after I should have left just look at the visuals and marvel at how breathtaking the vistas are. While it is cartoony, it serves the game very well.\n\nI would also travel the long way through areas, ignoring shortcuts I had opened, just to listen to the music. The music in this game is nothing short of spectacular, with each area having its own theme that sets it apart from the others, whether it be a mountain pass that screams for adventure, or the haunted remains of an old estate with creeping terrors around every turn, the music sets the tone and atmosphere for each area very well.\n\nThe combat in this game is a blast to play as well. You will find yourself slicing your way through hordes of monsters, with a small but very versatile moveset that never gets old. It is actually possible to have a fight last upwards of a minute, without ever touching the ground.\n\nAnother point about the world of this game that I wish more games outside The Elder Scrolls series would use is the use of anthropomorphic animals. All of the characters are some kind of anthro-morph, whether it is a fox, rabbit, mouse, lizard and many others. I really enjoy this kind of thing, and it really helps the game stand out on its own, instead of falling into the tired fantasy traps of the overused elves, dwarves, orcs, and so on, which have been used to the point of being a checkbox for fantasy.\n\nIn terms of story, this game is a marvel. The plot is surprisingly mature despite the E10+ rating, and makes a lot of "Mature" rated games look childish and infantile, and should last you around 11 hours depending on how many side-quests you do. I found myself genuinely caring for a lot of the characters in this game, while eagerly anticipating advancing the plot just to find out what happened next. During the story's darker points I was even moved to tears, which does not happen very often.\n\nFor $15, you get a game that does everything right, and will stick with you long after you have beaten it.\n","May 30, 2013","true","28.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So after a couple of hours of experiencing Dust: An Elysian Tail last night, I have to say I was quite impressed. Visually it's amazing (Don't need to go into that further, as it's plan to say this was made visually incredible). Game play is spot on and fluid (and I'm surprised yet again with a 2D game. I was impressed with Trine [and it's sequel] as well for that reason), but that's not what I liked best about this. It's the audio...OMG! The music is gripping and beautiful! I loved it, and even the voice acting is really quite good. I was worried that I would find Fidget annoying with so much dialog for her, but I didn't find her that at all.

I haven't had such fluid, fun, and badass-feeling combat... ever. It's also just generally one of the best action RPGs I've ever played, with some of the most gorgeous graphics you've seen. If you're not a fan of the furry/etc. culture that the character design revolves around, don't worry... you won't even notice as you play (I'm not and I have enjoyed it immensely... the characters being animals actually adds a ton of charm to the game that regular humans wouldn't be able to bring) . You will feel like a combo-based-combat god even if you have no experience in the genre, but there is still a good amount of challenge. I highly recommend playing on the hardest difficulty (with the intention of trying to never die, i.e. true "hardcore" or "ironman" -type playing) right off the bat... it will make the game much more rewarding and the learning curve is really quite an enjoyable experience.\n\nSome of the voice acting is the only thing I felt could use a little work, but it was only every now and then and you get used to it pretty quickly. For the most part the voices fit the characters pretty well, and the *entire* game is voice acted, so it's a minor issue.","July 16, 2013","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Now that I've played through it and completed the game to it's full extent I can honestly say that it really is an enjoyable experience.\n\nI'm seriously in love with the art style and the lush aesthetics which in my opinion add a lot to the immersion.. combat which is supposed to be one of it's best qualities is astonishingly captivating and dare I say it; visceral..? Add to that the RPG elements to give this game that addictive element of progression and the lust for exploration and you would be wondering what this game could possible miss out on - because from my POV everything else is just as great to say the least (characters, voice acting and the story which I really loved).\n\nIn regards to MvG, the character Fidget may very well be the only thing that could be considered a dealbreaker to some people. I for one couldn't imagine why because I think she's a charming and very lovable character but hey: not everyone is into 'cutesy' things so I suppose her voice and dialogue may rile up certain kinds of people.\n\nAnyhoo.. Great game, I'm a sucker for it.

Period. Every line is delivered perfectly and...I just don't know how to describe how perfect it is.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, everything is colorful and beautiful, and the environments are diverse, from snowy mountains to lava caves, and it all looks great.\n\nThe gameplay...great. The action is great and responsive,you don't have that many combos, but it's still very fun and has room for variety.And it's alwaysnice to see your combo meter rise, especially once it goes over 1000 :D With a wide variety of enemies to beat up, you will never get bored. Your character can also equip various mods and improve his stats, so there is room for customization of how your character will play as well.\n\nOverall, this is a beautiful experience, one I will never forget.The story,characters,music, everything fits together perfectly.10/10","March 14, 2015","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's everything but easy to write a review to this game.\nTo be honest, if this game had been published from a major company, I might have been disappointed. But it is an Indie-Game (and the first one Noogy ever made), so naturally one cannot compare it to a major release.\n\nAll in all it is a really great game, hands down. ;)\n\nNow enough talk, let's get to the likes and dislikes.\n\nLikes:\nabsolutely gorgeous artwork and animations\nan overwhelming soundtrack\nsmooth and action oriented gameplay\ngreat voice acting\nan absolutely cute and funny sidekick\nfunny innoendos about video game oddities (Mysterios Wall Chicken!)\nunintrusive and funny 4th wall breaks\nnice refferences to other games  (Mysterios Wall Chicken!)\nperhaps not innovative but nevertheless interesting aproach on crafting and trading (increasing the trader's assortment by selling new items to them)\nthe Mysterious Wall Chicken!\nDislikes:\nlevel grinding and item/gold farming is way too easy\nFidget becomes way too overpowered (I stopped using her powers at the meadows to keep the game halfway challenging, although I cranked up the difficulty before)\nspeaking of challenge: the first and the last boss fights were the only ones which were challenging to me, the latter perhaps only because I didn't use fidget\nevery health item stronger than the Mysterious Wall Chicken! is a bad bargain to buy (using 2 chickens heals 160 hp for 600 coins, the hot cocoa heals 160 hp for 640 coins, the birthday cake has an even worse cost-benefit ratio, so you end up swallowing countless chickens because it is the cheapest way to heal - but Mysterious Wall Chicken FTW!, so why should I care? :D )\n\nAbout the story... well, I'm actually a bit torn appart about it.\nYes, it follows quite common tropes and is per se not that innovative, but it IS a good story and keeps you interested, if you alow yourself to delve into it.\nBut there are two major drawbacks about the story.\nThe first and the most disappointing is that major plot elements are revealed waaaaaayyyy too early. In Aurora Ginger tells you that you're dressed like a royal assassin - first half of the plot revealed, and shortly after someone tells you about a "twin soul" - not sure if Fuse allready talks about it, but Lady Tethys most certainly does and thus revealing the other half of the plot.\nSo roughly after the first third of the game you can allready figure out what is going on, only the "when, where and why" is kept a secret until the near end.\n\nThe second drawback about the Story is that "it seems to be a bit shallow". That's one thing often critizised at negative reviews about Dust. Well, i dare to disagree, hence the quotation marks.\nI think the story itself is not that shallow (at least not more shallow than the Halo-Storyline *duck and cover*), but it is told in a shallow fashion. The arcs of suspense are boiled down to short cutscenes with only a few lines of dialouge and major plot twists are given away early and in a way as if they were only a negligibility.\nSo I say the Story would gain more positive reviews if it was told in a different way and revealed in a "different order".\n\nWell, yes, this was quite a bit of a breakdown, pointing out more negative features than positive ones.\n\nBut: Every positive feature mentioned outweights the negative ones by far.\n\nIt is an absolutely great game and mindblowingly detailed - especially if you take into consideration that this is the first game ever released by Noogy. Thats why I give this Game a thumbs up - I absolutely love it!\n\nOh and in case you haven't noticed yet:\nI friggin' LOVE the mysterious wall chicken !!! :D","September 2, 2014","true","42.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The initial story premise relies on piecing together the identity of the amnesiac main title character and what lead him to suffer from amnesia, honestly there's nothing hugely interesting about it. The standard story structure is followed and you meet some decent characters on the way but there's nothing hugely memorable compared to other indie titles on the market. However Dust: An Elysian Tail's biggest strength is its gameplay. Dust provides a nice hack and slash styled combat system that has RPG elements in that you can upgrade your abilities and wear specific items of clothing to increase stats further, the whole system gives depth to the game as you hunt for the best loot. Also the combat flows very naturally in thanks to the gorgeous animations that never hampers the pace of the game, allowing it to become rewarding and engaging. The only minor quibble is that it can sometimes become rather limited as you are tied with one weapon along with three magic assist abilities, as a result the game can drag especially if you're revisiting areas for a specific quest. The games presentation is stellar top to bottom with the voice acting being fairly good (Even if Dust himself can sound like he's trying too hard to be emotional at times), the background and character design's being stellar and the performance running smoothly without a hitch. Overall if you're looking for a fun action RPG to get into then Dust excels over many of its counterparts and can easily provide you with 8-10 hours of fun gameplay.","July 9, 2013","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fun, the artwork is beautiful, and the story really comes together in surprising ways at the end.\nBut there are a few complaints.\n\nThe big one is the health system. When you level up, you can choose to upgrade your choice of four things, one of them being max health. There is virtually no point in upgrading your maximum health. There is no natural health regeneration, and there are no inns or any other sort of place that you can go to restore your health. Completing a level does not heal you. The ONLY way is by buying health items from a shop. 20 health costs 80 gold. Sure, you can buy an item that restores 40 health for 160 gold, or 120 health for 480 gold, but there is no discount as you go up. No incentive to buy better healing items. No reason to increase your max health until enemies literally one shot you.\n\nMoreover, the amount of damage the enemies do doesn't seem fair. They either do virtually no damage, or they do a TON of damage, but not much in between. So you are either just flying through an area virturally ignoring all the enemies, or you are using up all your health items in a five minute period.\n\nThe voice acting isn't of the best quality either, which the exception of the main characters. When I talk to someone, I don't hear the character's voice. I hear a person trying to do a silly voice. As I talk to more characters, I can hear what is clearly just a small handfull of voice actors trying to do a bunch of different silly voices.\n\nBecause of flaws like these and more, I wouldn't give the game a perfect score. But there is enough about it that IS done well that I will give it a positive score.","May 26, 2014","true","21.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I did experience some display issues (flickering on the screen) but if you're like me, a child of the 80's,  and you experience it, I recommend pretending that you're just watching a well-worn VHS tape.  For me, that just added to the experience and even made it all the more endearing.\n\nThe story is compelling and you'll likely get sucked in and want to play this exclusively until you get through it.  There are some fun Easter Eggs that you can unlock as you go along as well.  Additionally, the progression is nicely paced between leveling up and the gear that becomes available throughout - I never felt like Neo until the very end despite rarely feeling like I was in danger of dying.\n\nI chose not to 100% this game becuase I wanted to save myself some aggravation.  The collectables can be quite challenging to get (or even to find) but there is a wealth of information out there online should you choose to go that route.\n\nBetween the nostalgic feel and comfortable gameplay, I would recommend this game to anyone.","December 7, 2014","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dust has pretty much everything I want from a fun and entertaining RPG, and more. The story might seem straightforward at the very beginning, but as you progress in the game you understand that it's not as easy to predict as you thought. The action component, which includes combos with the (sentient) sword and magic, is really well balanced and extremely fun. It fits perfectly with the RPG-like evolution of the character, with experience points to spend in improving skills and even a crafting system not to be underestimated (you can put together quite the equip if you take it seriously). Add to all of this the beautiful sceneries, artworks, and the epic, EPIC conclusion and you'll get a game experience you won't forget.","January 18, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What first got my attention for this game was the artwork.  And it is beautiful.  But then I found it's a 2D 'platformer' game, which I'm not that big on.  However I did enjoy Castlevania and some other reviews here likened it to that game too.  Then I learned that it was almost entirely done by a single person - animation, programming, everything, other than voices and music.  So then I was very impressed.  Especially with all the other very positive reviews.  So with it being on sale I went ahead and picked it up.\n\nAnd 70-some hours later I'm extreamly glad I did.  I still love the artwork, but have also fallen in love with the characters and the story.  Very enjoyable voicing.  I totally love Fidget (the Nimbat that looks to be a cross of a bat and fox).  There is a very serious and interesting story told, but also lots of fun and humor mixed in.  The fighting which you do a lot of was just fine for me.  Enough challenge to be fun and worthwhile, but not to the point of frustraition.  And the platforming is more exploration and puzzling than having to make pixel-perfect jumps, for which I'm glad.\n\nAll in all, if this game even looks a little interesting to you, by all means pick it up and have fun.  Even at full price it's not all that much, but on sale it's a no-brainer.\n","January 18, 2015","true","73.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

WOOOOOW!\n\nDust: An Elysian Tail is a side-scrolling hack'n'slash game, and for me, an awesome one.\n\nFirst of all, the graphics: they are just purely beautiful and colorful, the quality of design (maps/player/enemies) is perfectly looking like a drawn picture or anime/cartoon and nothing is ♥♥♥♥ed. Each detail is cured very nicely (foreground same as background and everywhere else on screen) and levels are all nice, even thou' they are all different (rain, snow, villages,...)\n\nNow, the controls: they are easy to understand and handling is really fast (keyboard+mouse same as controller). Action time is not boring after some hours passed on it.\n\nLets talk about the music now: and it is great point of the game. its music and ambiant sounds are clean and perfect. You play with a quiet and magnificent music, zen and close to lyrical register. Ambiant sounds (rain, thunder,...) are very realistic.\n\nAnd the last point, the story: Story looks great, characters are attractive and beautiful and Dust (the main one)more than anyone else, 'cause he does not know his past... What will happen?\nOf course, there is a good humor in it (and also some litlle bad words :P) but you will appreciate close to all characters (except that Gianni, I still got problems to like him after the first met).\n\nConclusion:[/b][/i]\nIn other words. This is one of my new favorite games! A real love at first sight (and play if I can say like that ^^').\n\nReally, I recommand that game if you like scrolling games with anime/cartoon animations. It is a very delighting game, a true pearl for eyes and you can just stay on levels just for hearing the music.\nThen, if you play at it, just ENJOY IT! ;)","December 30, 2013","true","28.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To put it short, it's an amazing game. The story is based on the character Dust who awakens in a deep forest with the Sword of Ahara and Fidget. Dust has no idea who he is so the three of them go on a adventure to find Dusts true identity.\n\nThe game looks BEAUTIFULL. No matter where you are. The forests or the mountains. The graphics look great and never hurts your eyes. The voice acting is great. The actors perform there job pretty well and the only voice I get tired of is Figets because she never stops talking sort of like navi from ocarina of time.\n\nGraphics and sound aren't everything and Im glad to say that the gameplay is great. Having a metroidvania feel. You will destroy large groups of enemies with the occasional puzzle or platforming. Dust controls soo smoothly and attacks fast and quick. With Fidget you can shoot projectiles but with Dusks whirlwind ability you can make Dust and Figet extremley powerful and quickly defeat enemies. When you defeat enemies, you get expierience points and when you get enough you'll level up. This can increase hp, attack, defense and Figets abilities. I personally try to upgrade Figet first because dust storm is just op.\nYou can do sidequests, craft items, etc when your not beating the snot out of enemies which gives the game some replayability. But it doesn't give enough.\n\nI don't really have anything wrong with this game. Except a couple of problems like one the game is pretty short it only took me 10 hours to beat the game. Two, its too easy. I didn't use a revival stone ONCE. And three I wish you could move faster than dusts regular dash attack. Because getting to one location to the next can drag after a while.\n\nThankfully, Dust An Elysian Tail is a great game. Great graphics, sound and gameplay make this a title worth owning. Definately get this game while its half price  right now thanks to the winter steam sale. I'll give a 4.5/5 to this AMAZING  Tail.","December 23, 2013","true","25.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played this back on the Xbox and noticed many flaws because the xbox could not handle everything but now its so flawless. To top that all they even added an RPG element of course not best one I have ever saw but it was still there. To play this you require one thing, open imagination. Thats it! Have fun!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigandsexy/recommended/236090/","bigandsexy","Big Sexy®","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigandsexy/","185 products in account","One caveat before I begin my review: I got this game for roughly $4 through the Humble Store, so some of my opinion is emotionally affected by the price point. Now, onto the rest of the review!\n\nI've played a lot of 2D side-scrolling action games with RPG elements at this point, but "Dust: An Elysian Tail" stands out at first because of the game's impressive artwork. The backgrounds are splendidly rendered, and the character design is neat and well done. In short, Dust is a very pretty game, and it rates well on eye-candy alone. However, what sucked me in the most about this game is its fun, simplistic combat system. Whether you're a vicious button masher (like myself) or a combo-obsessive technician, you can get hours of entertainment out of this game as you wage your war against evil. I found that this game was easy to binge despite its simplicity.\n\nSo, we've got a visually pretty game with a fun little combat system, right? Well, in terms of criticism, I can only really levy any on a single element: the story. The story itself, where you play as the mysterious warrior protagonist Dust, is a pretty straightforward affair. You attempt, with the help of the mystical Blade of Ahrah and its dimunitive guardian Fidget, to recover Dust's identity while helping to defeat an evil that has plagued the land of Falana for years. The dialogue and banter between Dust and Fidget can be kind of fun at times, but the dialogue in general can be very wooden at times, especially during the game's climatic ending. The story is simple (To be fair, this was a game built for the XBox Live Arcade) but, while easy to follow, it definitely leaves you wanting a little more in a bad way. While the game touches on Christian and Taoist themes (Shout out to my friend Olse for pointing this out to me initially), it definitely comes off a little more ham-handed than one might expect. The voice acting is roughly above-average, as it shines in some areas (particularly some of the banter between Dust and Fidget), while sagging in others.\n\nAll in all, for spending $4, DAET was a fantastically fun Action-RPG romp with gorgeous visuals. Its standard price is a little steep in terms of game length and replayability, but not so much that I wont recommend it. This is a game that I really suggest you buy and try.\n\n(As an additional note, I gather than Humble Hearts, the game's developer, is a one man operation.

It's a true masterpiece. The gameplay is solid and extremely fun (there's something very satisfying about being able to cause all of the enemies on screen to explode in a pillar of fire at once, which then racks up your combo counter). =3 The overall story is quite good, and worth playing just to know what happens. The graphics are beautiful, especially during rainstorms and blizzards. But what really makes this game shine is it's absolutely gorgeous soundtrack!!\n\nIf you're into 2D side-scrollers, RPGs, or just good games in general, you should definitely give "Dust: An Elysian Tail" a shot.

I strongly recommend it, but have only one gripe. The game is a bit short, however when you look at the fact it was made entirely by a single person, it is still rather impressive. The end leaves just enough open for a possible second, which I strongly hope the developer is working on.","January 27, 2014","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some cases you can see what is coming a mile away and some you don’t notice until it hits. It flows and should you want to stop the main story and explore some of the side quest it doesn’t stop you. There is only I do believe 21 side quest in the game. But some take a while and others not that long. There is a Yen and Yan ordeal all around the main character, which makes it interesting.\n\nGraphics have a neat art/graphical design to it. It is in a way kind of like an anime color to some areas bright and other dark. It is in I do believe a 2d side scroller is what it is called.\n\nCharacter design was also very well done. You will find yourself most likely liking the main character dust and his side kick figet. As well as many of the side characters. They all have their own personality set to them, despite there not being that many other npcs in the game. It makes it worthwhile to just hear what each on has to say. When leveling up your character you get to choice from 4 major areas to level up. My only complaint in this area is the fact that you couldn’t raise a skill more than 4 times without leveling all the other skills. You had to keep all your skills within 4 levels of each other. So you can’t just max out attack or defense if you choice. You will also find yourself looking for better equipment most likely if playing on hard or high difficulty. It has the rpg element to grind mobs for money or items to upgrade or buy better and stronger items.\n\nCombat is fun but takes a little getting use to if playing on hard difficulty. It can get a bit addicting in some cases. Especially if lining up combos of over 200. Take note no you are not killing 200 enemies. You are chaining attacks together on 1-6 enemies and possible moving onto the next group while keeping that chain. Depending on you attack damage you can chain bosses very high. Some areas you can run into up to maybe 20+ enemies but that is if you just run past everything and let it follow you.\n\nVoice acting is done really well also. Some will say it’s nothing special, but I’ve heard plenty of voice acting in full games that just don't compete with this game. It has a neat art work\n\nReplay ability is a little bit of a different story. There is not a lot that will change if you play and start a new game. Only one quest in the game can be changed, depending what choice you choose. Other than that, everything else will play out the same. Not that hard to get all the achievements if you’re looking to get 100% in the game. You could power run though the game in a few hours if you desired, but I took me time and explored and hunted down everything in the game. It took me around 18 hours to complete cause of that. The game is also easy to pick up and stop within minutes of starting the game with save points never being too far away.\n\nDifficulty can range from very easy to very hard. Should you wish to play it for just the story but still enjoy the combat, you can set it to easy. This will allow you to die as many time as you wish without hurting your characters progress, story, are the combat you are in. Only drawback is you lose your current chain. Personally you need to set it to hard to even get a challenge out of it. This will make death permanent and you will be sent back to your last save unless you have a revivable stone. Which should you need to you can buy them from shops which have unlimited amounts.\n\nYou can see all the time the developer took into making this game with the amount of settings and design that went into the game. This game was mostly done by one person over the course of 4 years.  He needs a pat on the back for making such a good game. Really this is how good games should be. Over all this is a great game. And well worth the time and small investment depending if you buy it at full or on sale on steam. In the end you will definitely be tipping your hat to the author.","March 7, 2014","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The world and the characters in it are unique and interesting. Voice acting's versatile and brilliant. Gameplay wise, the difficulty is perfect. The enemies are not invincible, but are by no means are cakewalk either. As in any good combat-heavy game, the combat system is simple, but flexible. I've heard many people say that the bosses in this game are too easy, but I still find them challenging enough. I don't think Dust: An Elysian Tail intended that the bosses be particularly difficult; I think they intended for bosses to be links in the story and chances to show off their brilliant game - and level design. For those who find bosses too easy, or just want a more intense expirience, you can always up the difficulty level. Magic spam is a viable strategy in this game, but in order to pull it off you need to focus 100% of the time. Personally, I don't think it's a problem, nothing in this game is broken or unbeatable. All in all, Dust: An Elysian Tail is a diamond, and a valuable diamond to be precise. This game is in my list of top 10 games ever made, and I would recommend it to anyone who is even somewhat interested in getting it.","March 8, 2014","true","26.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although this game is hugely combat based (it could be argued that it is a brawler) the story is very well synced with that fact.  I absolutely LOVED the story, from start to finish.\n\nthat aside, what really makes a game is what makes it fun, right?  so, yea..\nthe combat.\nohhhh the combat.\nMY GOD!  IS IT GOOD!\nThis has got to be one of the best 2D combat engines ive ever had the pleasure to play with.  ESPECIALLY for an xbox to pc port game (its never this smooth).  although i find it hard to get into single weapon games, this one did it right by giving you a versatile arsenal of combos and manuevers that make even the cannon fodder fights really fun.  whats more important, though, is that the combat engine is SOOOOO responsive!  i can scarcely believe how much this indie title outclasses so many larger developer titles with its combat engine.\nIT IS PERFECT.\nthere is plently of room for petty personal complaint, but as far as pure, solid fact goes, the combat in this game does EXACTLY what it's supposed to.  there are zero bugs with it.\n\nWhat I truly love about this game, though; aside from the entrancing story line and exciting combat, is the art.  and take that word loosely, because im talking the whole spectrum.  The animation for character and level design is beautifully done!  The music is absolutely breathtaking!  this game itself, is a work of art as far as videogames go.  It was created and brought to life by one man over 4 years, and you can easily see the passion and talent in his work.\n\nthis game is much like the older castlevania and metroid games (metrovania?), and in my personal oppinion, if it had been released in that generation (give some modesty to the graphics and sound qualitly, of course) it would have been an instant classic.  There is no circumstance in which i can justify not telling you to buy this game at its current price of $15.  i would easily pay twice that price for a game of this quality.\n\nOne of the best, most fun games ive played in recent years.","February 15, 2014","true","34.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Genuinely sad moments too.\n\nThe level design is varied and interesting, and it never felt like a chore going back to the newly accessible areas with new unlocked abilities. The mini-map is also well designed for showing where things can still be found with searching for almost everything.\n\nWhenever I had problems getting past something there was never that old school frustration with the game, but with myself. The difficulty is pretty easy on normal mode, and I’m planning to take a shot on finishing it in tough mode now to see if the challenge improves.\n\nThe full on duststorm spam attacks were very fun for the first play through, too! Well spaced save points, often entertaining voice acting (Fidget was cool!) and it isn’t like this is the first game I played with a two legged talking animal as the main character (that might well have been Master System Castle of Illusion).\n\nBought it in a Steam sale, but the full price isn't too high and probably worth it!","November 24, 2015","true","29.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is about a blue fighter animal human named Dust with no memory of the past what so ever. His companions are a talking sword that guides Dust. His other companion is Fidget which is the flying orange Nimbat which is flying next to Dust in the screenshots. Also what really took my attention is the artwork and dialog. The artwork isn't like SUPER FANTASTIC ARTWORK THAT LOOKS REALISTIC, the artwork is nice bright and dark at the sametime. Me, as an artist in training and wanting to do an artistic job in the future, can see that this took some sort of work to make. Also it was made by an independant designer Dean Dodrill. Enough talking about the art. The dialog in this is good in my opinion. Not too much, not too little. I hate games with so much dialog but I also hate if I can't understand what is happening. The game is also a "furrie." What that means is that it as human-like animals. I never played games like these or watched anything like it, so it was an experience. (I don't see anything wrong with it.) The game is a side-scroller with RPG element. Those never were fun to me but Dust: An Elysian Tail was! 9/10 (Battle System made it not 10/10.)","January 8, 2014","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each area looked beautiful with its paint style graphics. Also for the most part each area had something different to offer in the way of environment.\n\nStory 4/5\n\nI was extremely interested in the story. The story was pretty dynamic for how short it was. The main part of the story is Dust trying to figure out his mysterious past while he essentially helps people in need. Stories like this has definitely been done before, but for some reason Dust's story catched my interest a lot more then some others. With this said, the story left a lot of questions unanswered. For example, what was the background story for General Gaius? The story painted an interesting picture for General Gaius, but by the end, they just left General Gaius as the main Antagonist with very little explanation of why he did what he did. Also, the story could have gone two different ways. I think there could have been a possibility for two endings based off your choices. This could have made the story a little bit more interesting.\n\nGameplay 4.5/5\n\nThe gameplay was fun and rarely got boring. The game was a mix of 2d platform, rpg and action. You gain experience by defeating enemies and gain bonus experience depending on how high of a combo you can achieve. When you gain a level you are able to put one gem like stat point into one of the provided stats. Although levels were important it was mostly the abilities that you gained through the game that helped you the most in battle. The abilities you gained also looked extremely cool. At one point you were able to gain a fireball ability and if combined with Dust storm you were able to light most of the screen on fire torching your foes. With the right timing you were able to get a 1000 hit combo or more which was also very fun to watch and pull off. There were also many collectibles to keep you interested as well as challenge courses. I found the challenge courses difficult enough to get me angry after the 20th attempt which was fun but also a painful experience. The cameo characters were fun and sometimes difficult to find as well. These collectibles and challenges were not needed, but was a fun diversion from the main storyline. For the most part the gameplay was very well thought out but there were a few issues that I had with the gameplay. The combat was fun but did get repetitive at times. I feel like there needed to be more variety of skills to use, to keep the game from getting boring. The issue of repetitiveness was some what remedied by the shortness of the game, but I feel if the game went any longer I would have gotten very bored with the combat. Also near the end of the game I felt like I was overpowered. This may not be an issue with the game though considering I was probably overleveling while I was trying to get all the collectibles and finishing all the challenges.\n\nSound/Music   5/5\n\nNothing much to say here. The music and sound effects made sense for the environments and situations. The music sounded very good as well.\n\nReplayability 2/5\n\nIm trying to replay the game on a harder difficulty for the last few achievements but I find myself to lack the motivation to finish the game for the second time. There really isnt any thing different if you play it a second time besides the possibility to obtain some achievements and playing a more difficult setting. So a game plus option would have been nice or maybe a secret chapter where you can play as General Gaius and so on.\n\nOverall this game was amazing and well worth the money.","February 21, 2014","true","32.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have watched the evolution of gaming from the 8-and-16-bit era of Mario and Sonic, the evolution of PC gaming from text based RPGs to DragonAge and Skyrim.\n\nOf all the games I have played, from casual Runescape to the intensely cerebral Europa Universalis, from the flashy twitch gaming of Smash Brothers to the thought-out fights of Guild Wars.  "Dust: An Elysian Tail" is by far one of the most defining creations in the Gaming Industry.  What makes it more spectacular and amazing is the story of a single man hand-drawing and developing the game from scratch over years, of an indie developer given a chance on Xbox Arcade.\n\nDead Dodrill has brought to us a game that, in collaboration with secondary writer Alex Kain, and composers Alexander Brandon and HypderDuck Soundworks, defines everything we love about gaming.  He brings us back to the core elements of a video game.\n\nI can say, without a doubt in my mind, that Dust: An Elysian Tail is, by far, the greatest representation of Video Games as an Artform.  If there ever any confusion or concern if games could be consider Art, Dead Dodrill has proved us otherwise.\n\nNo amount of praise I could give would satisfy my love for this game.  For 17 years, Blizzard Entertainment's Starcraft franchise has held a special place in my heart as my favorite game of all time.  Upon completion of this artistic masterwork, I can say that this has changed.\n\nDean Dodrill, Alexander Brandon, and everyone else that not only made this game possible, but brought it to the attention of the general public.  I thank you, and I heartily reccommend this game for anyone.","June 26, 2013","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I just wish I could disable the specified things below to add to the challenge of the game.\n\n- Dust Storm: Really this is the most unbalanced thing in the game. The ground attack itself is pretty helpful, But even that had the inability to protect you from behind. As a result enemies could still damage you, Which balances it out. But once you unlock the ability to use Dust Storm in the air, You're practically invincible. On top of this, It can enable you to skip areas and obstacles entirely by homing in on enemies above you, and being able to fly the to the top of the area. All you'd have to do then is find the exit.\n\n- Fidgits projectiles: All this really does is add to the already unbalanced Dust Storm, And make it even more ridiculous. This practically disables the balancing of the ground Dust Storm attack, by enabling you to attack enemies from behind. Now you're immortal on the ground. Use it in the air, And it's even-more-so. The aerial version of Dust Storm already enables you to deal massive damage to enemies whilst not taking any damage, Add in any of Fidgit's projectiles and you can quickly kill everything that moves, Including some bosses. Really it's possible to beat the entire game only using this tactic.\n\n\nReally these are the two major things, It's not worth listing the others. Aside from the issues I did enjoy the game very much, and I would recommend it to other people. I just wish we could alternate the controls and disable certain things.","May 26, 2014","true","19.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But I think that's to be expected from a game rated E 10+!\n\nDust is an action, platforming, RPG. The sole mechanic is the "Dust Storm", a special move that lets you glide through the air and attack enemies. This move assists in combat as well as platforming.\n\nThe game's level design is split up so that you are platforming half the time, and the other half you are mowing down bad guys. It is unfortunate that there are only two distinct moments when you are doing both at the same time, and I would have appreciated more moments that combined combat and platforming.\n\nMany areas are blocked off at the beginning of the game until you unlock the special ability that lets bypass the specific obstacle blocking your way. These blocked off areas don't conceal anything super special, but I find a lot of joy exploring the map trying to find all the hidden chests.\n\nThe story is well written and well executed, and kept me engaged the entire time. There were certain sad moments that didn't effect me that much, but the chills I got at the cutscene before the final boss made up for that! There were countless jokes thrown in along the way that made me laugh!\n\nOverall, I think the game was a pleasent expierence and I would strongly recommend it!","March 27, 2014","true","21.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dust: An Elysian Tail was made by one man, and the game has the quality of that you see with teams of hundreds working passionately on a project.\n\nThe game itself is a 2D Sidescroller inspired heavily by games like Metroid and Castlevania. You will find yourself exploring a fairly large open world, looking for items, money, and powers which will allow you to explore areas that were locked to you before. The aesthetic style of this game is truly amazing as well. The use of varied colors really helps the world and its residents come to life in ways rarely seen in games today. I would find myself staying in areas long after I should have left just look at the visuals and marvel at how breathtaking the vistas are. While it is cartoony, it serves the game very well.\n\nI would also travel the long way through areas, ignoring shortcuts I had opened, just to listen to the music. The music in this game is nothing short of spectacular, with each area having its own theme that sets it apart from the others, whether it be a mountain pass that screams for adventure, or the haunted remains of an old estate with creeping terrors around every turn, the music sets the tone and atmosphere for each area very well.\n\nThe combat in this game is a blast to play as well. You will find yourself slicing your way through hordes of monsters, with a small but very versatile moveset that never gets old. It is actually possible to have a fight last upwards of a minute, without ever touching the ground.\n\nAnother point about the world of this game that I wish more games outside The Elder Scrolls series would use is the use of anthropomorphic animals. All of the characters are some kind of anthro-morph, whether it is a fox, rabbit, mouse, lizard and many others. I really enjoy this kind of thing, and it really helps the game stand out on its own, instead of falling into the tired fantasy traps of the overused elves, dwarves, orcs, and so on, which have been used to the point of being a checkbox for fantasy.\n\nIn terms of story, this game is a marvel. The plot is surprisingly mature despite the E10+ rating, and makes a lot of "Mature" rated games look childish and infantile, and should last you around 11 hours depending on how many side-quests you do. I found myself genuinely caring for a lot of the characters in this game, while eagerly anticipating advancing the plot just to find out what happened next. During the story's darker points I was even moved to tears, which does not happen very often.\n\nFor $15, you get a game that does everything right, and will stick with you long after you have beaten it.\n","May 30, 2013","true","28.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now that I've played through it and completed the game to it's full extent I can honestly say that it really is an enjoyable experience.\n\nI'm seriously in love with the art style and the lush aesthetics which in my opinion add a lot to the immersion.. combat which is supposed to be one of it's best qualities is astonishingly captivating and dare I say it; visceral..? Add to that the RPG elements to give this game that addictive element of progression and the lust for exploration and you would be wondering what this game could possible miss out on - because from my POV everything else is just as great to say the least (characters, voice acting and the story which I really loved).\n\nIn regards to MvG, the character Fidget may very well be the only thing that could be considered a dealbreaker to some people. I for one couldn't imagine why because I think she's a charming and very lovable character but hey: not everyone is into 'cutesy' things so I suppose her voice and dialogue may rile up certain kinds of people.\n\nAnyhoo.. Great game, I'm a sucker for it.

The characters are also vaguely to highly annoying. Luckily, the main character isn't bad, but your "companion" is almost as annoying as Navi. If you're lucky, you can read fast and skip over the voice acting/bad dialogue writing. The story is also subpar and fairly predictable.\n\nBut, then you may wonder why I've played this game for 14 hours (as of writing this review.) Well, that's because the game play is just fun. It's not quite a beat 'em up but there are small hoardes of weak characters with some stronger ones thrown in (not counting the bosses.) There is a hit-combo tracker in the top corner of your screen and a minor quest, plus the steam achievements drive you to really try to continuously hit as many times as possible. It's not simple. It also contains moves that are done using certain button pressing and joystick controls in a row or in combination. Beyond that, it contains "metroid-vania" skills that give you access to new areas, further parts of the story, and treasure you missed when first going through areas. There are side quests and the ability to buy or make armor/rings/weapon-improving items.\n\nThere are definitely some things that I just would rather not deal with with this game, but it's all in the cut scenes/story which is not a huge part of the actual gameplay which is good, because the game play is fun and continuously makes me want to move forward in the game. (Except for the very beginning which I played maybe a half hour of, and then didn't pick up the game for several months.)\n\nI'd recommend getting it if it is on sale for cheap because it's fun, but it's not really all that original, and it's not all that polished.\n\nAdditional note: I cannot speak to how the game plays with a keyboard&mouse or just a keyboard (both options). I played this game using an Xbox remote as it seemed to be easier on my fingers since there is a lot of action-button pressing and thumbs do that better than fingers.","June 25, 2014","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Estocire/recommended/236090/","Estocire","Jokoo Magician","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Estocire/","101 products in account","Moderately fun side scrolling hack and slash plat forming RPG game. Played on the second hardest difficulty with a usb playstation controller and it took about 10 hours to beat it just doing the main quest line. About 2 hours of that was just grinding because I didn’t bother with the crafting system so my gear wasn’t that good. The enemies are not that difficult until you get to the last area. The greatest challenge came from the platforming as jumps were often very difficult to make. Your regular jump often does not reach high enough so you have to attack in mid air to get that extra height boost, but this makes sticking your landing in the right spot more difficult. You also often just randomly fall through platforms when you land on them which can be frustrating. I also had to restart the game on several occasions because I would just randomly fall through and get stuck inside of walls. The good thing is there are a lot of save points so even if you get stuck you don't have to restart that far back. The story line/dialog is kind of cringey, but I just skipped most of it. The environment looks pretty nice, but sometimes it is hard to tell what you can jump on or what hurts you as the background and foreground kind of blend in with the main area at times. I wouldn’t recommend buying this game at full price, but since it was included in the humble bundle 11 you can probably get it for cheap.","March 3, 2014","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ronsemberg/recommended/236090/","ronsemberg","Immanuel Ronsemberg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ronsemberg/","116 products in account","I'm rarely Impressed by something. And when I say "rarely", I really MEAN it. And between the hundreds of games I played, those I really liked, can be counted on a single person's fingers.\nYes, Dust is officially in my top ten of favourite games I ever played.\n\nSo, gameplay: it's an hack and slash. Actual attacks can be done by pressing only 4 different buttons, and if you're crouched, in the air, and if you did one move or another before pressing a button, you can achieve various different moves. So, the game is a lot easier to handle than your average hack and slash (to the point it can be easily played with a keyboard). The protatonist is extremely fast in attacking, resulting in... well, a lot of slashing happening on screen. Enemies will for this reason appear in mass, resulting into extremely satisfying "slashsplosions". Ordinary enemies will rarely be a threat, only bossess will sometime be a bit of a nuisance. Yes, the game is quite easy, so I suggest you outright start at the max difficulty setting if you are used to hack'n'slash games.\nThere are some platforming sections that range from easy to very hard: I played at max difficulty, and many traps had the attitude of killing my character instantly, even on full health. I had to retry some sections a few times to get them right. Yup, platforming sections (if you play on max difficulty) are a bit better balanced than fight sections. Still, most of them are quite easy anyway.\nAs for the graphics: Well, the full scenery and mobile background, including almost all of the characters, both ally and enemy, are hand drawn. I'm not saying it's beautifoul to look at, but at times you will REALLY be noticing the passion that was put in creating the environments. This is not your ordinary sidescroller: It's really well done graphics wise. Only thing is that characters, especially npcs and the protagonist itself... ok, maybe it's me, but at times It looked to me that said characters were just animated sketches, rather than fully drawn frames. Luckily, I only noticed this when closely watching the animations, and it wasn't that much of an issue after all, the whole animations still look great.\n\nYeah so far it's a good game, but not a great one. So, the real reason I found this game amazing? Stupidly enought, it's because characters are extremely well characterized. That's an aspect I usually don't care that much about, maybe it's really that great after all.\nThe protagonist, the npcs, even enemies always have a weighty character on them. You know, it ain't about the plot, it's about how you tell it. And all characters in the game are excellent narrators of the story, both because of their graphical expressivity and because of their well made voice acting. Despite the story itself being kinda clichey (it's your typical "knight with no memories" story), I ended up attached to it, and I ended up attached to the characters themselves, to the point I felt sad when I completed the game.\n\nSo, the full motor of the story is the storytelling and voice acting, and it's wheels is the hand drawn style.\nFor the rest gameplay is fun, but way too easy, and platform sections are kinda good made, too.\nBecause of this, follow my advice: START IMMEDIATELY AT HARDCORE DIFFICULTY. Otherwise, you may end up finishing the game in 6 hours, and you will not enjoy it as much as you would.\n\nAnd yes, I am advicing this game. Even if you're not much into hack'n'slash games, it's worth a try. If you like hack'n'slash, then I definetly advice you to buy it.\n\nIf I were to rate this game, I would give it a 8/10.","March 6, 2014","true","26.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigandsexy/recommended/236090/","bigandsexy","Big Sexy®","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigandsexy/","185 products in account","One caveat before I begin my review: I got this game for roughly $4 through the Humble Store, so some of my opinion is emotionally affected by the price point. Now, onto the rest of the review!\n\nI've played a lot of 2D side-scrolling action games with RPG elements at this point, but "Dust: An Elysian Tail" stands out at first because of the game's impressive artwork. The backgrounds are splendidly rendered, and the character design is neat and well done. In short, Dust is a very pretty game, and it rates well on eye-candy alone. However, what sucked me in the most about this game is its fun, simplistic combat system. Whether you're a vicious button masher (like myself) or a combo-obsessive technician, you can get hours of entertainment out of this game as you wage your war against evil. I found that this game was easy to binge despite its simplicity.\n\nSo, we've got a visually pretty game with a fun little combat system, right? Well, in terms of criticism, I can only really levy any on a single element: the story. The story itself, where you play as the mysterious warrior protagonist Dust, is a pretty straightforward affair. You attempt, with the help of the mystical Blade of Ahrah and its dimunitive guardian Fidget, to recover Dust's identity while helping to defeat an evil that has plagued the land of Falana for years. The dialogue and banter between Dust and Fidget can be kind of fun at times, but the dialogue in general can be very wooden at times, especially during the game's climatic ending. The story is simple (To be fair, this was a game built for the XBox Live Arcade) but, while easy to follow, it definitely leaves you wanting a little more in a bad way. While the game touches on Christian and Taoist themes (Shout out to my friend Olse for pointing this out to me initially), it definitely comes off a little more ham-handed than one might expect. The voice acting is roughly above-average, as it shines in some areas (particularly some of the banter between Dust and Fidget), while sagging in others.\n\nAll in all, for spending $4, DAET was a fantastically fun Action-RPG romp with gorgeous visuals. Its standard price is a little steep in terms of game length and replayability, but not so much that I wont recommend it. This is a game that I really suggest you buy and try.\n\n(As an additional note, I gather than Humble Hearts, the game's developer, is a one man operation. If you take my recommendation and purchase it, know that you might be enabling another game like this!)","January 26, 2014","true","21.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

It's a true masterpiece. The gameplay is solid and extremely fun (there's something very satisfying about being able to cause all of the enemies on screen to explode in a pillar of fire at once, which then racks up your combo counter). =3 The overall story is quite good, and worth playing just to know what happens. The graphics are beautiful, especially during rainstorms and blizzards. But what really makes this game shine is it's absolutely gorgeous soundtrack!!\n\nIf you're into 2D side-scrollers, RPGs, or just good games in general, you should definitely give "Dust: An Elysian Tail" a shot. It's well worth it's price tag.\n\n5/5","January 17, 2014","true","20.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I strongly recommend it, but have only one gripe. The game is a bit short, however when you look at the fact it was made entirely by a single person, it is still rather impressive. The end leaves just enough open for a possible second, which I strongly hope the developer is working on.","January 27, 2014","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With one of the most adorable character I've seen in any game, Fidget, a not world-breaking story, but good nevertheless, a easy to get into and go through gameplay, Dust: An Elysian Trail, is a very solid action/adventure/rpg game. I recommend it.","January 11, 2014","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
