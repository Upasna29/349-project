An alternate take on the Frankenstein story, the premise is interesting albeit a bit hokey at the same time.  Granted, HOGs are not known for their great storylines as they're often just a base to build a game upon, but that's usually enough for me.  The time period offers us an amazing setting for gorgeously drawn backgrounds and artwork, my favorite aspect of these games.\n\nKeys, keys and more keys.  A good portion of the game involves finding different keys for lock boxes, doors, and just about everything else.  Some open puzzles while others give access to new rooms and areas of the map.  While it gets rather tiresome opening door after box after door, once I realized that's basically the shtick of the gameplay I was able to sit back and enjoy it for what it is.  Fortunately, there are plenty of puzzles to play through, but nothing too difficult or mind bending. The hidden object scenes are interesting in that many include mini-puzzles within them as well, a neat addition that you don't see very often.  As for the scenes themselves, they're nicely drawn with no deceptively hidden items, just challenging enough to keep your eyes sharp.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=407653953\nIf I had to describe Frankenstein: Master of Death in one word it would be "pleasant."  There are no leaps in logic needed to progress, no puzzles that completely boggle the mind, and nothing about the presentation that I feel was grating or annoying.  That said, If you're interested in something a little more challenging, you might want to look elsewhere. But if a casual experience with some light puzzle solving is what you're after, this may be the HOG for you.  Although on the pricier side for its length (it only took me 3 hours to 100% the game), full Steam integration adds a bit of value back into the package.  If nothing else, it's worth keeping on your radar for a nice sale.\n\nBottom Line - Recommended for casual gaming fans looking for a relaxing and enjoyable experience.","March 16, 2015","true","3.6"," 99 of 105 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","99","105","5","1"

It was fun on my first playthrough, until I found out about this overly sensitive achievement, to not skip any cutscenes or dialogues. I restarted and still didn't unlock until later on I realised it was broken and you had to delete your save file and start over. So I did, but clicked by accident during a cutscene so I had to restart again. So yes, I did, and just when I was nearly done the game just randomly.. crashed.. and during a cutscene!! I took a break then decided I'd give it a last shot. Was taking snail steps. No accidental clicks, No skips, full credit. And the achievement didn't pop up. Was about to rage until I saw it was unlocked on my profile. *sigh*\nThe game is good, although the puzzles and HOGs are too easy even on Expert difficulty. Most objects are placed out in the open rather than hidden. Art and story are tolerable. But overall it was a something new and different from Artifex Mundi games, which I liked. But please fix the achievements.","September 23, 2015","true","6.7"," 78 of 90 people (87%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","87","78","90","24","7"

Looking at the individual elements of the game as stand-alone things, most of the pieces are OK.  But, when looking at the game as a whole, then the thing edges into the Not Recommended arena.\n\nOn the plus side, the graphics are good.\n\nIn the middle, the puzzles and HOGs are very easy (even for the genre) and the voice acting is tolerable.\n\nFor the slightly negatives, the story is very weak (again, even for the genre), the game is short (3.9 hours for me to finish it), a couple of items in the HOGs were mis-identified (cow <> antelope, forceps <> toenail cutters).  There also seems to be some kind of problem with some of the Achievements.  In my case, the game didn't give me the "Expert" Achievement (which we're supposed to get by playing in Advanced mode on Hard -- which I did).\n\nBut, the things that hurt the game the most are:\n\n- An awful lot of the blocking items throughout the game are variations on keys.  Key after key after key after key.  Yes, you have to find the crowbar or something.  But, a very heavy trend is that those things you need are in a case or behind a door that needs its own special key.\n\n- The chronological anachronisms strewn throughout it.  The story is a variation of Frankenstein and takes place around the year 1800 (give or take).  Yet, here and there in both the scenery and the HOGs are modern objects.  The big ones in the scenery are what look like a WWII airplane and a VW Beetle car.  There's no reason for this.  In addition to those, here are some of the other anachronisms I noted:  modern fire extinguisher, 1950's era toy robot, dynamite (not invented by Alfred Nobel until 1863), aluminum step ladder with plastic parts, movies, gramaphone (1887), digital numbers on a neon sign, reel-to-reel tape recorder, 1960's era camera, rubber dishwashing gloves, incandescent light bulb, and a foil tube of glue (complete with a recycling symbol and volume in milliliters).\n\nSo, I'm sorry to say I'm not recommending the game.  Definitely not at the list price of almost $9.  But, I'm still not recommending it at the dirt cheap price I got it at (less than $2).","June 15, 2015","false","3.9"," 95 of 126 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","95","126","0","10"

Definitely not as good as Artifex Mundi, but still a HOG worth playing.\n\nThis HOG was somewhat more inventory oriented than others on Steam. Some items have multiple uses. A recurring theme is finding particularly shaped keys to open doors or containers (over a dozen).\n\nThe hidden object scenes are quite easy compared to most HOGs. The scenes are not very cluttered and the objects are placed normally rather than being hidden in clever but often unintuitive ways as many HOGs like to do.\n\nA single playthrough takes only about 3 hours.\n\nPros:\n* Nice static art\n* Some scenes have some animations\n* Hidden Object Scenes have many mini puzzles\n* Hidden Object Scenes not too difficult\n* Puzzles are straightforward/easy (there is a sliding 9-puzzle, though, that I'm not a fan of)\n* Good cutscenes\n* Good voice acting\n* All achievements can be earned in a single playthrough (don't use hints or skip anything, and ensure that Advanced Mode is set in Options before starting).\n\nCons:\n* 3D characters are a bit ugly\n* Monster and some character animation is silly looking\n* Somewhat weak writing (though not terrible for a HOG)\n* Crude use of sound effects. Music is sometimes annoying.\n* Some illogic (e.g. can cut chains but not thin bars with hacksaw)\n* No replayability features (scenes not random, can't replay scenes).\n* Crashed once during gameplay (progress auto-saves), once on startup, and every time on exit\n* Some achievements are buggy (if you don't earn them the first time around, you may have to purge your profile data to earn them). I still haven't unlocked 2 of them despite seemingly meeting the conditions, but I haven't tried the data purge trick yet.","April 11, 2015","true","3.9"," 52 of 60 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","52","60","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/recommended/347430/","gog-protoss","Protoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/","4009 products in account","What is Frankenstein: Master of Death? Apart from a fierce name, that is?\n\nFrankenstein: Master of Death is one of those casual adventure games that contain some hidden object search. The story of this game is based on the famous novel by Mary Shelley: You play as the hero who needs to help Frankenstein in containing a monster that his assistand Igor created.\n\nThe game is completely controlled with the mouse. I'm not sure in how far it is a typical hidden object game, so I'd like to elaborate how it plays:\nYou go through a number of screens, always being able to return to every previous screen. Those screens contain points of interest that for the most time have a puzzle or keyhole you need to interact with. In a few cases, those points aren't shown by a "navigation" tool that shows the possible interactions - I think there are three points like this in the game where you have to use an object on a piece of wall to advance -, but usually they are shown. So when you interact with them, you might have to use one of your items in the inventory, you might just collect something, a puzzle comes up or a keyhole shows. If a puzzle comes, it could be a hidden object game where you have the additional task of assembling three items before you can collect them, sometimes including easy minigames. Other puzzles are visual puzzles where you for example slide pieces around, or at one point even a tangram that took me the longest of all to figure out. In the case of a keyhole, you can open it with the fitting items if you found them earlier, such as a flower key or some ornaments. In addition, solving a puzzle might be required.\n\nAnd that is pretty much all that happens, essentially it is a classical adventure but with lots of casual puzzles thrown in. Now in theory you can skip puzzles after a while, but this is never necessary (except maybe at the tangram) and locks you out of one achievement if you do so. Talking about achievements, there are 20, all which can be gotten with a single playthrough on the "hard" difficulty mode. Since everything is still easy, the "easy" mode is probably a complete no-brainer. Apart from the three hidden walls you can open. There is a hint system, which to my knowledge does not invalidate any achievements. Achievement hunters still should face no challenge here, as the missable achievements only require to not skip anything - including cutscenes and dialogue - and play on the hardest difficulty.\n\nThe story is not completely uninteresting, but doesn't add much to the original. Which is a shame since the thoroughly interesting ethical issues of a Frankenstein machine are only addressed briefly. The music is good, but forgettable, the sounds are fitting.\n\nSo what remains is a game that kept me entertained for three and a half hours, I played through it in one go with losing interest at one point but not enough to stop playing since the progression is nicely paced. There is often a wonderful flow, leading you to get one item and remembering from an earlier scene that you can try it there to open a locked passage or container. Can I recommend this then? Well, the main strength of being nicely paced and short here works against it in matters of playtime, so I can recommend it if you get it on a sale or are generally interested in the genre.","October 15, 2015","true","3.6"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","30","34","2","1"

While I think the developers did well in crafting a spooky atmosphere with the game's ~30 beautiful rooms (or scenes), the voice acting isn't very good (the protagonist's voice is especially awful), and the story is poor.\n\nIn fact, the storyline goes as follows: The protagonist, a friend of scientist Frankenstein, is tasked to stop Frankenstein's  monster, which Frankenstein greatly regrets creating. The protagonist then discovers that an evil man (an associate of Frankenstein) has a grand scheme to control this monster, and you basically go from scene to scene trying to stop this evil man. Ridiculous events occur in which this evil man slips from your grasp over and over. After awhile, I found myself not caring about what was going to happen next.\n\nI play many HOPAs, and I finished Frankenstein: Master of Death in under 2 hours on Expert mode. This game simply wasn't a cost efficient purchase for me, which I could look beyond if the game had a memorable story and/or characters, which it doesn't. There are many higher-quality HOPA games out there with more gameplay hours for the same price, and a much more captivating storyline.\n\nIf you're a collector of HOPAs and really want to buy Frankenstein: Master of Death, I strongly suggest you wait until it goes on sale for a couple of dollars.

Keeping the story on a restricted thrill without spoiling it either is great about the game, because the main point of us playing it is revealing the tale of it. Another great thing about this game is that it has perfectly logical puzzles, unlike other games who have ridiculous solving solutions. Frankly, this is my favourite point and click game so far, because it makes me feel like a handy-man on all the puzzles and clues. It's like every time a "dilema" strikes, you find immediately the tool or solution needed to go further, which is great, nobody has time to waste 1 hour on a clue like in other games.\nIt also has achievements and trading cards, which are great for players who either do badge crafting (or sell them and gain money back) or for players who hunt achievements.\nAll in all, this game is definitely worth buying and I doubt someone couldn't enjoy it. At least one aspect of it, if not all.","July 30, 2015","true","9.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","2"

I finally settled on no after things quickly devolved in to ceaseless key hunts. Ultimately, this game played out like a late-nineties to early-two-thousands "I Spy" game, but with much more work put in to the art side of things.\n\nI was unable to watch a lot, if not all of, the cutscenes, as playback stuttered horribly to the point of not functioning.\n\nIn terms of artwork, the game is really an 8/10, with two points off for the somewhat low-quality pre-rendered parts that were presented in an obviously different resolution and aspect ratio from their surroundings (this is noticeable when video crossfades back to the game), and for some of the models (the cat next to the basement door) having a disengagingly low polygon count and/or bizarre texturing issues (the bat looked like one big smear of the same texture).\n\nIn terms of script, things hold up pretty well; however, I noticed some glaring grammatical mistakes characteristic of non-native english speakers and some serious misnaming of objects, for instance:\n\n* Nail Clippers are called "Foreceps"\n* A Gazzelle Head is called a "Cow"\n* A musket or flare gun is called a "Revolver" (regardless, it has a single-round chamber -- not a revolving chamber).\n* A trowel is referred to as a "Spatula"\n* Vaccuum tubes are referred to as "Bulbs"\n* A suspended cable car is referred to as a "Funicular" (a Funicular is slanted trolley that travels on a slanted track).\n\nin addition to many more.\n\nFurthermore, there are some absolutely bizzarre anachronisms:\n\n* Glue in a foil tube with 70s-era labeling\n* Fire extinguisher in modern style\n* A reel-to-reel tape player makes an appearance in a time when wire recording was just beginning to appear\n* Toy Robot\n* Early-40's vintage aeroplane\n* Bizarre cyborg robot thing\n* A vinyl record which, to add insult to injury, is then played back on a record player clearly intended for shellac records\n\nand I could go on.","September 23, 2015","false","3.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Would I recommend it? Well for 97% discount - certainly, but if you're a bit more serious HOG player, you'd find the game a bit too easy and fairly rough around the edges, a far  cry from the best of the genre as Artifex Mundi titles, or Drawn series. It's a really casual affaire, even in "advanced" mode with lots of animations and, somewhat unexpectedly, lots of 3d rendered objects. And those are a double edged sword. Sure, they're a bit nicer than just animated-by-wrapping 2d pictures which make the staple of the low(er) budget games, but they're not anything to write home about.\nEverything said points to this game being for slightly younger audience than standard fare.

Well for 97% discount - certainly, but if you're a bit more serious HOG player, you'd find the game a bit too easy and fairly rough around the edges, a far  cry from the best of the genre as Artifex Mundi titles, or Drawn series. It's a really casual affaire, even in "advanced" mode with lots of animations and, somewhat unexpectedly, lots of 3d rendered objects. And those are a double edged sword. Sure, they're a bit nicer than just animated-by-wrapping 2d pictures which make the staple of the low(er) budget games, but they're not anything to write home about.\nEverything said points to this game being for slightly younger audience than standard fare. The ground school (or younger) kids could enjoy it. I don't find it boring just because I fly through the scenes so quickly. Yes, do go an play it. If you paid just a few cents for it.","September 27, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The safety gauntlet feature really shows how useful protective equipment can be when dealing with deadly spiders, broken glass and other worldly dangers! Throughout this game, you chase after the dethroned lord of the Electric Kingdom whose memories were lost after his fall from grace. On your travels, you meet his most powerful warriors, who you befriend and take with you on your quest to regain the memories of Lord Electrojuicer (My run in with Nigel Hummersby the little red spider - the high general of the Electric Kingdom army - had me howling with sadness at his backstory... Of how his wife and young daughter - both named Adrian - were snatched away by an overly sexual crow, and of how he gouged his own eyes out for a drunken dare). Throughout the game, you utilise powerful weapons, such as the cobweb duster of forgotten legacies and the mirror of dribble and destroy all those who stand in your way. The choice at the end of the game - whether to give lord Electrojuicer your own heart, which has been filled with the warmth of his memories, or to remove his entrails, climb inside him and pretend to be the true lord of the Electric Kingdom is one of the hardest choices I have made to date. 10/10 rating, I especially recommend this game for those suffering from lice infestations.","September 22, 2015","true","1.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

It is recommended for those who want some new, yet not too different experience in this genre.\n\nLong version:Frankenstein: Master of Death is the kind of hidden object game that tries to win buyers with its gorgeous visuals that look good on any store page. But, like many good-looking games, it lacks in gameplay: most puzzles last barely half a minute, and even the hidden object scenes are too desolate– albeit not bad– to provide any challenge. Most of the difficulty comes from the amount of backtracking, so I hope you have a decent memory.\n\nThe story uses Mary Shelley’s classic as sort of a loose frame to build upon, and creates a standard “rescue kidnapped woman” plot around it. Thankfully said plot barely makes any presence, which also means that the amount of voiced lines is low enough to not get on anyone’s nerves.\n\nOverall, it is a pretty, decent, but quite forgettable game with nice visuals.

But this game was different, aside from the very laughable voice acting, the cut scenes gave me the nostalgia of PC games from the late 90's early 2000's which may either make you laugh, or make you remember some of your favorite first PC games. This Hidden object game actually has a story to it as well, and it isn't terrible either. It can also be a little challenging on occasion, which I admittedly was not expecting from a Hidden Object game... but it's more than that... there are puzzles to solve, there is backtracking because you will obtain an item further on that helps you solve something from several levels back. This game is short but not too short, and enjoyable. For anyone looking to play something less heart pounding and just relax and enjoy a puzzle adventure... this will be your cup of tea. I'd say its incredibly well done for a game in its genre. A solid 9/10 (as far as Hidden Object games go) I'd give it a 10/10 if the voice acting wasn't so awkward.","October 12, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saadmerchant/recommended/347430/","saadmerchant","Alsaad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saadmerchant/","53 products in account","How To Like - Frankenstein: Master of Death - Review\n\nShort Version:\n- Maybe Buy it On Sale & Only Play it On Hard Mode (as the game itself recommends)\n- Expect a fun and short (couple of hours long) interactive Puzzle-play experience.\n- Don't expect great story or characters you'll care to remember\n- Seemingly illogical at times, but kept me enjoyably engaged until I finished the game - in one go.\n\nLong Version:\n\nWHEN MUST YOU PLAY THIS GAME -\n\nI recommend - you play it - WHEN you're in the mood to take a break from long, intensive & content-heavy-games (which we love and must always go back to), and you're in the mood to play something just for fun - that'll massage your brain, in that almost-challenging-kind-of-way...\n\nAlso, while the Game is a HOG, the entire game isn't about finding hidden objects, in fact the HOG part of the game appears in the form of minigames within the game, absent which you're usually solving puzzles or collecting objects and putting them to use, which according to me was really fun - as it kept the game from becoming monotonous...Since the only other HOG i've played is Criminal Cases on FACEBOOK - I embarassingly admit - I'm fully aware of how quickly such games risk tiring you out...\n\nWHEN MUST YOU NOT PLAY THIS GAME -\n\nIf you're expecting a story-driven experience - Do not play this game then! Because the story just feels like it's there for the sake of being there, flimsily attempting to hold the game together. Not meaning to be harsh, but I just felt like the backdrop and the base story - "Visit Frankenstein who manages to resurrect the dead" - just had so much potential to make for an interesting plot and memorable characters.\n\nWHAT COULD HAVE BEEN! -\n\nInstead of playing an investigating friend that's trying to puzzle out how to save your friend from the resulting dangers of his experiments with death, the story could have been intelligently woven around Frankenstein himself. In other words a HOG that had the player traverse "the fragile border between life and death," carrying out puzzling experiments and collecting important ingredients and samples - to concuct the solution for eternal life. If it had a solid story and a loveable character, it could have even been as something I'd love to see and gladly buy - when released as episodes.\n\n\nALL IN ALL THOUGH -\n\nIt's definitely a fun experience worth playing, or atleast a game you should give a shot - if on discount. It's a relatively short game that provides an experience which you'll enjoy, but not one which will stay with you after you'ved played it.\n\nBut I'll say this though, eventhough you'll scoff and complain at a few instances in the game, if you're into it - the game can keep you hooked and it's a fun experience to watch unravel. I was playing it with a friend by my side and even as a spectator - it kept him engaged to the end as well, just watching and shouting suggestions and ideas for solving the puzzles and obstacles the game presented, all the way till we finished it.\n\nIt also helps that the game has mini-cutscenes that show you actually using your objects from your inventory, on the objects to which their uses correspond to.

The game as a hidden object/point and click experience met my expectations, the gameplay was truly awesome, I enjoyed it a lot.

You must find out what ails your friend so you quickly go to where he is. You are to be met by the love of his life Elizabeth, but upon arrival a monster pulsing with electricity takes off with her, and closes the gate behind it. You will now have to find your way through this and many more puzzles as you try to unravel the mysteries surrounding not only this place but what your friend has been up to.\n\nMaybe I'm getting better at these type of games, but I felt like this one was pretty short. After two hour and a half I saw the credits rolling, the rest are spent on getting the rest of the achievement and of course once again a twist right at the end. I wonder if any of these games will actually have a sequel? One of the few things I dislike about this game is when there were some items that seemed pretty important at the time that were one and done, but there were other items that definitely could have different uses that you just kept in your inventory forever. At the same time you would get to a point in the game where you are still toting around a lot of the reusable stuff that you have now gotten used to and magically it would disappear after you hit the limit or the usefulness was magically up.\n\nAlthough the game was short I did enjoy the puzzle solving, and the different puzzles that were put in my way. I did notice that there were quite a few times where I felt like I was going between the exact two places to unlock something or retrieve an item. I know that you don't want to just have a room that is done one time through, but it seemed odd that to unlock this room you had to go to another room and then go back, unlock something, and then go back to that other room to unlock something there in turn.\nAt the end of the day this game definitely allows you to dip your foot into something that can definitely keep you occupied, and for the most part entertained. Is this a must have game, no, but its not a terrible game either. So if you're a fan of the genre, you might want to get it while it's on sale.\n\n\nEDIT: Almost forgot to mention that right off the bat I ran into a problem where the game was crashed for no reason. And after doing some investigating, turned out the problem was on my end (thanks ESET!). Thankfully that was the last time I see it though.","October 16, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its atmosphere and level of gameplay are consistent, you don't feel trapped when you don't know what to do and the story is decent.\n\nGraphics are awsome and smooth, there aren't any glitches and that's a big selling point.\n\nIt definitely isn't the most challenging one, especially on normal for experienced hidden object players, but I found it charming and gripping.\n\nSome players might experience problems with triggering two achievments (playing on hard and not skipping cut scenes), you bettcha I did, I played through 5 times, but if you do, just follow the online guides and you'll be able do trigger them in 2nd playthrough.\n\nOverall, I'd buy this game once again, I bought Dracula's Legacy (the next Jetdogs studios games) and I'm looking forward to buying the next title of theirs. That's why I have to recommend it.","March 1","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story involves you receiving a letter from Victor Frankenstein, asking for help. As for gameplay, as I already mentioned, it's a mix of puzzles and hidden object games, with some point-and-click thrown into the mix, as you'll be getting items to use later on, in different areas. The different minigames (puzzles and HO) are pretty straightforward, it's the "point-and-click" part which can get confusing, as there's a lot of backtracking.\n\nWell, I don't think I can write much more about this game. If you enjoy puzzle games, then I'd say it's worth a shot, so I recommend it.","May 30","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Almost all of it is busy work, and it feels like there is very little plot, which is frustrating.  However, the most upsetting thing about this game was how buggy it was for me.   It crashed frequently (7-8x during the play) and at one point it allowed me access to an area I shouldn't have had access to yet, which ended up confusing the game play even more.  Overall, not something I would suggest spending a lot of money on.  If you are patient, the bugs don't force a restart, so you can play through them.... but, otherwise I would skip it.","September 23, 2015","false","2.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Most of the time, the rest is fun too though. As is the case here.\n\nVery pleasant Hidden Object scenes. Not cluttered, only a few things to find at a time, so instead of my usual random clicking on any object until only a few are left, I actually look for them. The mini puzzles in the HO scenes to complete/dig out objects are also nice.\n\nThere are some interesting puzzles strewn over as well, but sometimes it doesn't explain how to do something (like rotating arrows in one puzzle - hold it and click right mouse button).\n\nThere are a lot of inventory items to use, which I would have liked to all see at the same time, rather than needing to scroll through. On the other hand, unlike in other HO games, I don't have to find the same kind of item again and again that vanishes after one use.\n\nThe HUD (with map, hint, inventory, and menu button) can be hidden or locked in place. Not just useful, but sometimes needed in HO scenes.\n\nThe area the story takes place is rather large, a lot of different locations that aren't all within the same building.\n\nIt has fast travel by map, I blame tiredness/RL distractions for not being able to quite get where to go and what to do early on, when I mostly resorted to just using the hint for directions. Near the end I got a hang of things though. If you can remember what's where (and there's images of the locations on the map), you won't have any trouble fast jumping around the map.\n\nThe story is rather nice too.\n\nThere are few games where I don't turn the music off first thing, so I can't say anthing about that.","June 17, 2015","true","3.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

By opening the map not only can you move from location to location with a simple click (no running between multiple screens to get where you want to be) but it also shows you if you have completed every task available at that location, or if there is still something you have to do. That feature alone lifts the game to above average status, but just don't go expecting the second coming of hidden object games.

Frankenstein is an excellent example of this, having a solid engine and slick visuals married to absolutely brain-dead gameplay. And that's not even that much of a knock against it, considering the trappings of the genre.\n\nFrankenstein is, unsurprisingly, a re-telling of Mary Shelley's classic tale of science gone awry, just with more crests and crossbows to click on. In a strange twist (yes I am going to spoil the plot of a hidden object game, brace yourselves), Frankenstein is actually the hero, compelled to complete his heinous experiments by his partner and patron Igor. You play his friend, firmly invested in saving him from Igor and his monster, who looks remarkably like Raziel from Soul Reaver pre-jaw loss. The cutscenes are pretty well animated and the game actually has dynamic 3D models for many of the characters and creatures, which is a huge step up from its peers.\n\nThe gameplay is the customary hidden object scenes and simple puzzles, but taken to an infantile extreme. The hidden object scenes are absolutely huge, with some objects to find being nearly a quarter of the screen. Seriously, you could click at random and find all but the multi-part items, which usually just require pushing a button, using a knife on a rope, or assembling something. The challenge here is way, way down from other hidden object games, and is brought back up in aggravating fashion by tons of backtracking and an absurd number of crests. Seriously, I think there are maybe three keys in the game compared to the three dozen crests you have to collect to open up all the rooms of the mansion.\n\nIt's a very clean-looking product, with no technical hitches and all the quality-of-life elements of a modern hidden object game. It's just not very engaging, mostly because of the poor difficulty balance. If you got it for pennies like I did it's worth a try, but I can hardly recommend it at full price.","October 8, 2015","false","2.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

These are similar puzzles to what you see in other HOGs, but I enjoyed that slight twist. It also has standalone puzzles that are sometimes similar to what's in the HOG scene.\n\nThe bad:\n- The game itself is very short (achieved 100% with 2.7 hours), and\n- the majority of that time is spent collecting excessive amounts of tools and items, and backtracking through scenes to use them. I know this is a common tactic in many HOGs, but the in this game, it seems like for every one item or tool you use to unlock a chest or new area, you discover two to three new ones.\n- Because it requires so many items to complete, it does get overwhelming trying to remember the exact location of every single interactive object in each scene. Probably not too difficult on Easy difficulty, but if you're playing on Expert, you will probably be missing destructible walls and lost items left and right. Often times you'll wind up advancing five or six scenes to collect an object, and then spend ten or more minutes trying to remember and then find the location that it's to be used.\n- That's confounded by the fact that the game's locations become a blur. You can theoretically divide it up between three main indoor areas (which are subsequently each divided up between three to six sub-rooms), and then linear outdoor areas that conjoin them. While it's fairly easy to keep track of the outdoor areas, I would find myself oftentimes wandering around one house for several minutes just to realize the object I was looking for was actually in a different house altogether.\n- Finally, the puzzles themselves are just way too easy and require very little thought.\n\nOverall, although it starts off on a strong foot, it quickly devolves into an extremely repetitive (and oft frustrating) experience that became a chore to finish.\nI would recommend any number of other HOGs before this one.","December 27, 2015","false","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Think of all the things that tend to be tedious about hidden object adventure games: lots of pointless back-and-forth between locations, stiff 3D animated cut scenes, tasks that demand exactly the right tool even though you have plenty of stuff that should be able to solve the problem... this game had it all.\n\nThat last issue was especially aggravating in this game. It's annoying when you use an item and it vanishes from your inventory when any rational person would keep it around, and that happens here with a torch and a bucket, both of which would come in handy later. You do get to keep quite a few items for most of the game, like a knife, a crowbar, and a screwdriver.\n\nBut for example, when you find a cabinet with a missing handle and a cracked glass door, you can't use your crowbar to shatter the already broken glass to get the fishing pole you can clearly see in reach. You have to run around for ten minutes until you find that missing handle. At one point I was confronted with boards nailed across a doorway. I couldn't use the crowbar because the boards were nailed from the other side, which is dumb enough, but I also couldn't use the hacksaw in my inventory to saw through the boards. No explanation for that. The game forced me to wait until I found an ax before I could get through those boards.\n\nThat kind of thing happened over and over again. Along with another pet peeve of mine that shows up in too many of these games: you're supposedly racing to rescue your friends, but your character is too squeamish to touch cobwebs or coal with his bare hands, so you have to go find gloves and tools. It breaks any suspension of disbelief the story managed to work up.\n\nI play this type of game partly to admire the illustrations, and this had nice art. But in some little areas, the second I clicked on the items to add them to my inventory, the scene vanished, and I wasn't able to click on it and see it again, which seems like a waste after they went to the trouble to illustrate those areas.\n\nThe story for some reason makes Igor out to be the villain rather than Viktor, but this change doesn't seem to amount to much. It appears to be set in the original story's time period, but there are weird anachronisms-- at one point, you find and search a Volkswagon Beetle! The hidden object scenes and puzzles were very easy.\n\nFor one or two bucks this game would be okay, but I think anyone who pays more than that would be disappointed.","January 15","false","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

For what it's worth, it will keep you casually entertained for a while. The point and click part is rather typical, and I have to say most of the puzzles are quite logical. It's not outstanding, but if you catch it on a good sale, you can go for it, maybe for kids or for a couple of hours of mental rest.\n\nPROS:\n+ Simple, straight-forward, good within its genre.\n+ No ludicrous inventory combinations -mostly.\n\nNEITHER/NOR:\n# Story was... kind of like in porn, a forced excuse for the puzzles and the hidden object scenes, but not that awful.\n# Voice acting was poor, but within the "cartoon-esque" style of most hidden object games.\n\nCONS:\n- The backtracking lost all logical sense after a while, destroying immersion.\nExample: you get to a room where a very dramatic situation is happening, and you need to act quickly... BUT you also need to go back to room #4 to pick up that piece of XXX, then combine it with the item in room #7 at the other end of the place, then cross a river and catch a plane, then finally go back to your... emergency? Made no sense at all.\n- The "oh I need a special shaped key" became annoying after a while and took over any hint of story.","February 10","false","7.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The English translation is mostly passable, but frequently stilted, and some of the voice actors are less than convincing.  The gameplay is very linear; despite a few forks in the map, you will work through each puzzle and unlock each gate in exactly the designed order -- you will never have a few potential options.  The HO scenes are brief and not particularly challenging.\n\nThe pseudo-historical setting is even more anachronistic than usual.  Your character arrives on the scene in a horse-drawn carriage, but later uncovers a Volkswagen Beetle... presumably just because the creators already had an HO scene set in a car that they wanted to use.  The Frankenstein mythos is predictably abused as well.  The original book is completely lost, and the game refers more to the various film adaptations, but with Igor the lab assistant transformed from a deformed wretch into a power-mad nobleman with a penchant for moustache-twirling villainous monologues.\n\nThis might satisfy the itch to play an HO game, but there are plenty of superior options out there.","October 5, 2015","false","3.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I definitely recommend it to every one who wants to venture in hidden object games. This game is perfect for beginners. Why did I say that? Because compared to other hidden object games, this one is gamer-friendly; the puzzles are that difficult to solve and the hints are very helpful. Unlike other games, when you click the hint button, it will just show you the location of the next step, but the exact place and not the exact thing to do. Here, the hint is a bit generous in helping the players finish the game. This game doesnt have any journal that documents the story, but the hint button is enough to compensate that. Another thing I liked about this game is the navigator. Unlike other games, you have to use your cursor and run it to the place very slowly in order to check whether you missed a spot. In this game, you just need to click the navigator and there you have all the place where you need to search. Others may say, that makes this game not challenging. Like I said, I recommend this to anyone who is a beginner in the field of hidden objects.\n\nTip: Do not skip. I skipped and I haven't achieve the last achievement yet.

This title had a ton of potential, but it just fails as a game. The only thing it has going for it is its production values, with pretty decent cinematics and at least some good voice acting. But the actual gameplay is what we buy it for, and that part is frankly broken. Way too much backtracking (made worse by the lack of a map or other fast travel option), increasingly absurd "keys" and other such cliched inanity, and far, far, FAR too many times - even for a game like this - when a simple solution (like just smashing that thin pane of glass with any of the several suitable tools in my inventory) was rejected as "impossible" in favor of yet another of the far too numerous "special" access items or actions. In fact, while I know these are a staple of the genre, never have I seen them so blatantly and nonsensically overused throughout every segment of game - they absolutely saturate it. Thankfully, the ordeal will be over in under two hours, assuming you're a genre veteran.\n\nEven the Hidden Object scenes are far too easy for any but the youngest players (and some darkness in the story undermines the game's suitability for that particular audience), and if you keep the UI locked to the screen (as many of us prefer to do), you WILL have blocked objects in almost every HO scene - a cardinal sin of HO design. And in the rest of the game, progression is frequently obscured by unintuitive action requirements. The nail in the coffin? A glitch kept a late-game item from entering my inventory when I found it, instead resetting its little vignette and keeping me from activating it again - translation: I couldn't finish the last minutes of the game. For you developers out there, that's not really what we'd call acceptable.","October 22, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The storyline is great, with a little twist in it, the in game graphics are nice, and the cut-scene graphics are even better.\n\nEverytime I play a hidden object game, I like to get my kids involved (5yrs->9yrs).  The added extra of puzzles within the hidden object parts really had them (and me) on their toes, and i thought this was a great addition to the genre.\n\nReplayabilty is low, obviouslty story doesn't chance, but the fact that the hidden obects are the same each time round (2.5 run thoughs for me (to be explained soon)) doesn't add any extra challenge to the game\n\nThe 2.5 run throughs was Achievement hunting...  1st run through (with the kids), got me all but 1 achievement, "The Devil in the Details", with no real 'clue' within the achievment's title or subtitle (Pay attention to the details). I thought because the kids used hints, I didn't get this achievement on the first run, we finished the game, i tried again. I accidently hit hint, and then restarted the game (thus the .5). finally got the achievment on the final run....\n\n!!! ACHIEVMENT SPOILER !!!\nAfter getting it, i found out that you need to listen to all dialog within the game, it has nothing to do with hints. And because my son read the captions and clicked, it voided the achievment on the first play through.\n!!! END SPOILER !!!\n\nBesides that little annoyance with the achievent, it is a fun game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cakes1/recommended/347430/","cakes1","ʕგҚვֆ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cakes1/","1174 products in account","Probably one of the best point & click hidden object adventure games I've ever played, but then again it doesn't take much to be better than the usual title of said genre. The design is this games overarching strong-point, like all games of this type nowadays, you are basically always searching for a new key to open the next spot, which will help you progress through the next and so on. But the design is impeccable in that the game recalls old items from the beginning of the game, even at the end. You have to reuse tools and objects you found a long time ago, and also use new tools on old objects you discovered a long time ago, which does mean some back-tracking but it's not that much of a problem, and really ties the entire game together and makes it feel solid.\n\nHunting down keys nonstop basically makes Frankenstein: MoD a huge fetch-quest, which isn't a good thing. But how else can you design this sort of game without it consisting of SOME back-tracking? So I don't knock the game that much for that. Also it's worth mentioning how beautiful the game is, the animation snippets you get and the transitions from painted world to 3D world are well done and add a lot of beautification to an otherwise dull game (most hidden objects are all picture-based, meaning most of it's not 3D modelled).\n\nFrankenstein: MoD stands out from other hidden object games because of how fluid the gameplay is, the hint system is very well done, the puzzles are a bit easy but creative, and the variety of mini-game style and hidden object screens is very well done and the game makes sure it doesn't overload the player with too many mundane tasks. The story is obviously nothing too unique, because it is the traditional Frankenstein story, but with a few small dark tweaks, but basically the same idea. The characters are ripped straight from Frankenstein as well but they do have different personalities when compared to their classic counterparts.\n\nThe voice acting is below par, but only in the non-cutscene dialogue sequences. Inside cutscenes the characters have better voice acting funny enough, though even out of them it's not THAT bad, just a bit choppy and some of Igor's lines almost sounded sarcastic when they were supposed to be serious. I love how the game removes items from your inventory when you're officially done using it, like for example I got a crowbar at the beginning of the game and opened things up with it throughout the entire game to the very last 20 minutes, but the last time I needed to use it it left my inventory afterwards. This created a cool sense of progression as by the time I got down to the final task in the entire game, I only had one item in my inventory, it almost made it more dramatic and intense.\n\nI only have a couple complaints about Frankenstein: MoD. The first one is the fact that some parts of the game are incredibly specific, but mind you it only happens like three times; most of the time it's pretty easy to see where to progress (I played in Hard Difficulty, if that means anything? Not sure what Easy did but Hard was easy enough). But these few spots had things that were way too specific and basically required the use of a hint, and if you're trying to do a hint-less run, you would probably need prior knowledge of the game. My second and final complaint is a tiny picky problem I have with the end of the game: you start to pop Steam achievements for, say, never skipping an I-Spy mini-game right after the last one is completed, but the game isn't necessarily completed. So as long as you don't check the achievements it probably wouldn't be a problem but I popped it, looked at it's description, and saw that I completed my final I-Spy mission thus basically telling me the game only had a few minutes left. I don't know, it was just a weird way to end the game, knowing exactly that this is the end.\n\nBut aside from those small problems Frankenstein: MoD was a pretty good game. The reason I only gave it a 7/10 after saying all these positives about it is because of how mundane the actual gameplay can be. It really is just a huge fest quest hidden under easy puzzles and pretty art. But it did manage to hold my attention for a good 2.5 hours, which is rare nowadays, so there must be something about it that most games don't have.\n\n7.4/10","December 24, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The storyline is great, with a little twist in it, the in game graphics are nice, and the cut-scene graphics are even better.\n\nEverytime I play a hidden object game, I like to get my kids involved (5yrs->9yrs).  The added extra of puzzles within the hidden object parts really had them (and me) on their toes, and i thought this was a great addition to the genre.\n\nReplayabilty is low, obviouslty story doesn't chance, but the fact that the hidden obects are the same each time round (2.5 run thoughs for me (to be explained soon)) doesn't add any extra challenge to the game\n\nThe 2.5 run throughs was Achievement hunting...  1st run through (with the kids), got me all but 1 achievement, "The Devil in the Details", with no real 'clue' within the achievment's title or subtitle (Pay attention to the details). I thought because the kids used hints, I didn't get this achievement on the first run, we finished the game, i tried again. I accidently hit hint, and then restarted the game (thus the .5). finally got the achievment on the final run....\n\n!!! ACHIEVMENT SPOILER !!!\nAfter getting it, i found out that you need to listen to all dialog within the game, it has nothing to do with hints. And because my son read the captions and clicked, it voided the achievment on the first play through.\n!!! END SPOILER !!!\n\nBesides that little annoyance with the achievent, it is a fun game.

This title had a ton of potential, but it just fails as a game. The only thing it has going for it is its production values, with pretty decent cinematics and at least some good voice acting. But the actual gameplay is what we buy it for, and that part is frankly broken. Way too much backtracking (made worse by the lack of a map or other fast travel option), increasingly absurd "keys" and other such cliched inanity, and far, far, FAR too many times - even for a game like this - when a simple solution (like just smashing that thin pane of glass with any of the several suitable tools in my inventory) was rejected as "impossible" in favor of yet another of the far too numerous "special" access items or actions. In fact, while I know these are a staple of the genre, never have I seen them so blatantly and nonsensically overused throughout every segment of game - they absolutely saturate it. Thankfully, the ordeal will be over in under two hours, assuming you're a genre veteran.\n\nEven the Hidden Object scenes are far too easy for any but the youngest players (and some darkness in the story undermines the game's suitability for that particular audience), and if you keep the UI locked to the screen (as many of us prefer to do), you WILL have blocked objects in almost every HO scene - a cardinal sin of HO design. And in the rest of the game, progression is frequently obscured by unintuitive action requirements. The nail in the coffin? A glitch kept a late-game item from entering my inventory when I found it, instead resetting its little vignette and keeping me from activating it again - translation: I couldn't finish the last minutes of the game. For you developers out there, that's not really what we'd call acceptable.","October 22, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean I only paid like $0.50 for it on sale so it was well worth the cost. It kept me entertained for like 2 hours or so (not including idle time). I got to play a game, hear a story, and give myself something to do while waiting on progression on a roleplaying game on my other monitor. I'll recommend it if you need a time-waster and have some change laying around, but otherwise I think there are better games you could choose from.\n\nPros:\n+Story was interesting to see. It didn't suck.\n+Variety of puzzles so it didn't seem repetitive.\n+Appreciated the instructions for the puzzles upon opening the puzzle, without having to use a hint to know what kind of a puzzle it was so I didn't sit there forever doing the wrong thing.\n\nEhs:\n=Drawings were okay. They weren't as good as some of this style games are, but they weren't awful either.\n=Cannot review sound or any voice-overs (I'll assume there are some) since it was late so my speakers were off.\n\nCons:\n-Certain parts lacked subtitles. I couldn't turn on sound and I seem to have missed some parts because they didn't have subtitles unlike the rest of it.\n-The game was on advanced and still didn't seem hard at all. Either I'm really good at these games, or it was just too easy for an advanced mode.\n-I didn't like the handholding aspect of it. I'd click on something and it would say flat out at the top of the screen 'I could use a screwdriver for this.' Meh. Its like, "Oh, well thank you game, I happen to have a screwdriver in my inventory. Rather than figure it out myself so it requires any effort on my part aside from clicking, you go ahead and tell me how to do it, mmk."\n-Sometimes the bottom of the screen that flips up your inventory would not respond. It kept sending me back a room instead of opening the inventory.\n-When the inventory would respond, it had an annoying delay to flip open. The back button to go back a room was also delayed. I really didn't like the delays when having to travel back 10 rooms for a stone or something.\n-I was honestly tired of the back and forth. Its fine to find pieces in one room, go to another, go back, go to another, etc. But when your inv has a scroll bar because you are still collecting pieces from 7 rooms ago... thats excessive. I was starting to get annoyed having to walk back that far to finally open a chest for a piece that really could have been given further up in a different room.","December 29, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's say this game didn't dissapointed me that much as other similar hidden object games.\n\nFirst thing: watch all the cutscenes, just for the love of the story, which is quite good compressed in this game( I honestly didn't expected to encounter the monster during the game, but it was a nice surprise).\n\nThe graphics are quite well developed, though I have to say a very annoying thing that happened during this game: some hidden objects were placed behind the Main Menu button and it was awful to find the correct spot on which I should've clicked in order to reveal the object. Also at the first install the back button didn't worked at all, so I had to re-launch the game.\n\nMaybe there would be enough space for more complicated puzzles. I mean, I didn't had to struggle much in order to complete them, or didn't even needed hints.\n\nThe soundtrack is barely noticeable as the main goal is to complete puzzles, so you have soundtrack or not doesn't really matter. I compared this with The Secret Order 2: Masked Intent, another favorite hidden object game, and the bad thing is that this game is quite short, unfortunately.\n\nHowever, overall, this game can be fun for anyone who wants to play a casual game, though maybe the steam price is a bit higher for this type of game.","December 21, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's say this game didn't dissapointed me that much as other similar hidden object games.\n\nFirst thing: watch all the cutscenes, just for the love of the story, which is quite good compressed in this game( I honestly didn't expected to encounter the monster during the game, but it was a nice surprise).\n\nThe graphics are quite well developed, though I have to say a very annoying thing that happened during this game: some hidden objects were placed behind the Main Menu button and it was awful to find the correct spot on which I should've clicked in order to reveal the object. Also at the first install the back button didn't worked at all, so I had to re-launch the game.\n\nMaybe there would be enough space for more complicated puzzles. I mean, I didn't had to struggle much in order to complete them, or didn't even needed hints.\n\nThe soundtrack is barely noticeable as the main goal is to complete puzzles, so you have soundtrack or not doesn't really matter. I compared this with The Secret Order 2: Masked Intent, another favorite hidden object game, and the bad thing is that this game is quite short, unfortunately.\n\nHowever, overall, this game can be fun for anyone who wants to play a casual game, though maybe the steam price is a bit higher for this type of game.","December 21, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The design is this games overarching strong-point, like all games of this type nowadays, you are basically always searching for a new key to open the next spot, which will help you progress through the next and so on. But the design is impeccable in that the game recalls old items from the beginning of the game, even at the end. You have to reuse tools and objects you found a long time ago, and also use new tools on old objects you discovered a long time ago, which does mean some back-tracking but it's not that much of a problem, and really ties the entire game together and makes it feel solid.\n\nHunting down keys nonstop basically makes Frankenstein: MoD a huge fetch-quest, which isn't a good thing. But how else can you design this sort of game without it consisting of SOME back-tracking? So I don't knock the game that much for that. Also it's worth mentioning how beautiful the game is, the animation snippets you get and the transitions from painted world to 3D world are well done and add a lot of beautification to an otherwise dull game (most hidden objects are all picture-based, meaning most of it's not 3D modelled).\n\nFrankenstein: MoD stands out from other hidden object games because of how fluid the gameplay is, the hint system is very well done, the puzzles are a bit easy but creative, and the variety of mini-game style and hidden object screens is very well done and the game makes sure it doesn't overload the player with too many mundane tasks. The story is obviously nothing too unique, because it is the traditional Frankenstein story, but with a few small dark tweaks, but basically the same idea. The characters are ripped straight from Frankenstein as well but they do have different personalities when compared to their classic counterparts.\n\nThe voice acting is below par, but only in the non-cutscene dialogue sequences. Inside cutscenes the characters have better voice acting funny enough, though even out of them it's not THAT bad, just a bit choppy and some of Igor's lines almost sounded sarcastic when they were supposed to be serious. I love how the game removes items from your inventory when you're officially done using it, like for example I got a crowbar at the beginning of the game and opened things up with it throughout the entire game to the very last 20 minutes, but the last time I needed to use it it left my inventory afterwards. This created a cool sense of progression as by the time I got down to the final task in the entire game, I only had one item in my inventory, it almost made it more dramatic and intense.\n\nI only have a couple complaints about Frankenstein: MoD. The first one is the fact that some parts of the game are incredibly specific, but mind you it only happens like three times; most of the time it's pretty easy to see where to progress (I played in Hard Difficulty, if that means anything? Not sure what Easy did but Hard was easy enough). But these few spots had things that were way too specific and basically required the use of a hint, and if you're trying to do a hint-less run, you would probably need prior knowledge of the game. My second and final complaint is a tiny picky problem I have with the end of the game: you start to pop Steam achievements for, say, never skipping an I-Spy mini-game right after the last one is completed, but the game isn't necessarily completed. So as long as you don't check the achievements it probably wouldn't be a problem but I popped it, looked at it's description, and saw that I completed my final I-Spy mission thus basically telling me the game only had a few minutes left. I don't know, it was just a weird way to end the game, knowing exactly that this is the end.\n\nBut aside from those small problems Frankenstein: MoD was a pretty good game. The reason I only gave it a 7/10 after saying all these positives about it is because of how mundane the actual gameplay can be. It really is just a huge fest quest hidden under easy puzzles and pretty art. But it did manage to hold my attention for a good 2.5 hours, which is rare nowadays, so there must be something about it that most games don't have.\n\n7.4/10","December 24, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music, voice-overs, and graphics are all excellent, and the video cutscenes are seamlessly integrated into the more static scenes (far more seamlessly than i have seen in any other HOPA). However, again and again i find myself asking "what the hell just happened?" or "why, with a pickaxe, a metal gauntlet, a crowbar, and a knife, am i unable to frighten away one tiny bat who's blocking my access to a widget?" The tons of backtracking is made a non-issue by the ability to warp using the map, but the map is horribly confusing until one realizes that it's larger than the screen and is scrollable (once you realize that, it's no longer confusing, but is notably unconventional for this type of game). i felt compelled to abandon ship after one too many WTFs which just didn't jive with the urgency being presented in the story. (i mean, come on, use your pickaxe or metal gauntlet to break the cabinet's window and grab the thing on the other side, rather than searching the whole island for a key.) Yes, such features are typical of a HOPA, but when urgency is a central part of the story, the protagonist's inability to use a metal gauntlet to break a cabinet window or scare away a bat reveals an inherent dissonance between a story conveying urgency and the OCD personality required of HOPA protagonists. The two do not cooexist well, and that conflict ruins this one for me.\n\nSummary: if you're able to accept the extreme OCD behaviours inherent in HOPA protagonists, even when they conflict immensely with the feel of the story, you will likely enjoy this. Were the story more casual in tone, i could likely finish playing it, but the stark dissonance between the story's tone and the HOPA-conventional OCD of the protagonist breaks it for me.","May 14","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In addition to the hidden object stages, there are also many types of one-off mini puzzles throughout the game (sliding block puzzle, dial rotation, etc.). The variety is welcome, but the balance of the game isn't quite what I expected when I booted it up.\nI had previoulsy been led to believe that this game was mostly hidden object screens. There's a lot more "find the sun key to open the chest that contains the moon key so that you'll be able to get through the door to the star key" progression. Many of these instances involve objects rather than actual keys, and it leads to some dissonant logic. You find a saw that cuts metal, but it only cuts certain kinds of metal objects. You need to fish an item out of a dangerous spot, but rather than use the long-handled pliers you just found, you have to find something that will cover your arm so you can reach in. It seems like this is always a risk when the player is able to find "tools", but it would be too boring and repetitive if it was 100% keys and crests. Also to their credit, several of the items you find will be used multiple times.\n\nI haven't played many games of this type (as of this writing) so I don't have much basis for comparison, but it's obvious a lot of work went into this, and I don't have any real complaints with the quality.\n\nMedicated Ham / 10","May 20","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
