"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/279580/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","A common phrase we use to describe a piece of media is that it is "more than the sum of its parts". One game that immediately comes to mind is Drakengard. This Square-Enix title manages to weave an absurdly dark storyline, chaotic music, and awful game-design into something incredible. Unfortunately, Devil's Dare is not a game that fits this description. While it does have numerous issues, it doesn't create the unique and fulfilling experience necessary for them to be overlooked.\n\nHumanity is doomed again. This time around it's a zombie-apocalypse and-wait! Where are you going? Don't you want to know how a plucky group of convention-goers save the world?  Yes, this is a story that we've heard a thousand times. However, since this game is a beatemup I see no reason to be concerned. This is a genre that flourished in the arcades, where stories consisted of a few screens and maybe a line of text. Anyway, there are six playable characters, each with their own weapons and abilities.\n\nThis game is divided into 10 stages among four selectable areas. Each area will have one more stage than the last, with the fourth area consisting of four stages and a unique final boss. It's a neat system that promotes replay value. The stages themselves are standard for the beatemup genre: move from left to right (sometimes vice-versa), beat up zombies, avoid obstacles, and fight the boss.\n\nIn beatemups that have multiple characters to choose from, there is usually one or two that stand out. In the case of Devil's Dare, Jonathon is just overpowered. He is an unlockable character and his weapon of choice is the shotgun. Aside from being great at crowd-control, he can drop bombs and roll-away. When the bombs are upgraded to land-mines, they become truly threatening. Basically, his strategy for beating bosses will involve hitting them with the shotgun, then setting a land-mine directly on top of them. I'm not sure how, but this causes the mine to do extreme amounts of damage, usually enough to kill. The bosses in Devil's Dare have a lot of HP, but this technique can wipe them out nearly instantly.\n\nAs for everyone else:\nQueenie has healing and a fairly effective infinite with her ice-beam.\nAxel is all-around good.\nKingston can do some decent damage, but his grab-special just doesn't work for this game.\nJack is fast, but most of his moves are really ineffective.\nAnthony is the other secret character. He has range, but his machine-gun isn't good at handling crowds.\n\nThe key to surviving Devil's Dare is in "herding" your adversaries. When dealing with three or more enemies, you want them to group together. This involves manipulating their attack patterns. It's really easy to figure out, since enemies have certain moves depending on your character's proximity. Also, you have access to a dodge-roll, which makes herding even easier. Once everyone is close to one another, then you unleash combos and special-attacks to wipe them all out. With a bit of practice (and the right character) you can dominate every encounter.\n\nThis is the reason why I think the difficulty of this game is overstated. There are limited continues, and yes they have to be purchased with in-game money. However, you're given more than enough tools for not just beating the game, but also cheesing it. Defeating three or more enemies with special attacks causes food to drop. Certain characters (like Jonathon) can wipe out groups with ease and keep their health topped off. Certain bosses can be rough, due to the constant presence of minor zombies. However, it's all a matter of finding the exploit that works. Also, if you don't mind straight-up cheating, you can simply hit ALT-F4 when you die. The game saves the completion of each stage. So if you want, you can merely restart the stage instead of restarting the game.\n\nAfter beating a stage, you're given a choice between various purchasable upgrades. A number of them - like the aforementioned land-mines - are definitely worth it. The others are broken. From my experience, the defense seed (boosts DEF) doesn't make a difference. The Piracy (free upgrades at the cost of HP) and Free cash ($250) upgrades don't work at all. In some cases the combo-extending upgrade...doesn't extend combos. One upgrade even allows the player to randomly kill an enemy instantly. This is far less useful than it sounds, and is even detrimental. Insta-kills don't get the bonus that comes from performing special-attack kills. Also it makes certain boss-fights absolutely painful, like the TMNT: Turtles in Time-inspired boss. For this fight you have to defeat Terminators, so that they fly into the screen and damage the boss. The problem is insta-kills cause the Terminators to simply explode, which doesn't affect the boss.\n\nA number of other glitches can happen as well. There are female zombies that attack with what looks like a golf club. Their swing actually hits you a split-second before it's supposed to connect. Also, only certain attacks or specials can hurt them. Picking up cash instead of hitting the enemy was already mentioned in a review, but it goes further than that. If food and cash pick-ups overlap, you will ALWAYS pick up the cash first. This is immensely frustrating, since beatemups usually give you a half-second of invulnerability while you're picking something up. I've also gotten stuck in walls and hit by laser beams despite being far away.\n\nStill, it's most important that we look at the bigger picture. Is Devil's Dare fun? Yes and no. This beatemup delivers on the basic thrill of clobbering enemies, but it doesn't get any deeper. All the expert mode really does is raise the costs of revival and spawn stun-immune monsters. The only real advantage the zombies have is numbers, but even that can be used against them, due to the food rewards for massive kills. Most of the playable characters are simply too strong, and not in a way that makes it entertaining. The combos are bland and rely on infinite spams or overpowered special moves.\n\nThere's also something to be said about all of the references. As you saw in the trailer, Devil's Dare loves their call-backs. Everything from Ghostbusters to Streets of Rage to Binding of Isaac gets some representation. How much is too much? When your game suffers from a complete lack of identity. I see a ton of stuff that reminds me of other games and movies. Listing them all would be too much for a 50-page review, let alone this one. Altogether these references make the game rather unremarkable. There's no subtlety, no real wit or creativity. It's just "Hey! listen! Doesn't this remind you of something awesome?" Sure it does, but I'd rather be shown something original, something that I might remember years from now.\n\nEven if you can look past the flaws, you'll find that Devil's Dare doesn't do enough to stand-out. Rather, it allows itself to be buried by its influences. It's not a terribly-designed game, but it rarely does anything better than the titles it apes. Drakengard, for all its faults, is also distinct and memorable. This game goes too far in showing its love for the classics, even when it comes at the expense of an identity.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","July 8, 2015","false","9.1"," 56 of 83 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","56","83","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/279580/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2360 products in account","Devil's Dare is another sad story of a good game abandoned too soon.\n\nThe hit detection in this game has the consistency of spoiled milk. Certain moves just do not connect to enemies well, or have very little business being in this game due to the expectation of finishing enemies off in large groups. Pulling off an atomic buster should be an impressive feat of Russian, bear-crushing, strength, not a series of awkward gropes like you don’t know how to properly kiss a zombie. Because of the varying sizes/shapes of characters and enemies, judging where you need to position a character to pull off the right move is more trouble than it should be, and at times it feels too finicky to even try. The player is essentially fighting the angle of the game and the wonky hitboxes in addition to the enemies.\n\nThe combat system needs some tweaking. As it stands the reliance on special finishers (called fatalies here because that’s not copyrighted?) in order to gain ample money and health items takes some freedom away from the player and forces them to corral enemies to slaughter. Special moves require the player to use parts of their special meter that don’t recharge that quickly on their own. To exacerbate this problem, using a special move to escape enemies once they attack the player drains the special meter and puts it on a long cooldown. Because people mistakes and deserved to be punished? Enemies easily lock up and stun the player so death can happen fast without a special bar. On top of that there are some moves that are just plain bad at group kills, like the hookshot and throw moves.\n\nIt has so many references even the writers of the Big Bang Theory are throwing up. It would be fine to have Commander Video pop in for a special, Shovel Knight appear as a background prop, fight Jason Voorhees, play as a Tron Bonne clone, or perform a hadouken, but all together it is overkill. The amount of referenced material easily outweighs the original content. Instead of this saturation of other games’ materials, it would have been better to aim for substantial homages, chance encounters, or overall more original designs. Having one Shovel Knight statue hidden among many, having a dozen other attacks in addition to the referenced ones, fighting facehuggers among all kinds of other neat monsters, a chance for a Ninja Turtle zombie to spawn in the sewers, etc. The brown palette, though different, is not enough give the game a sense of its own style and falls under the weight of other games.\n\nThe mechanic of stage select with the order changing how the stage plays is great. One of the bigger flaws with most brawlers was their linear progression and lack of variety (though later era ones did break the mold), and Devil’s Dare directly addresses this issue. This helps keep the game interesting throughout different runs. Once you master one route, it’s entertaining to see how the final stages of each path playout. For the first few times, the bosses are a great surprise.\n\nAside from bugs and an economy that needs tweaking, the challenge in the game is fair. Figuring out attack patterns, hazards and strategies for different enemies feels good. The touting of permadeath is a neat compromise to bridge the gap between classic arcade experience and modern games: allowing the players to exit and return to the game is certainly more forgiving than the coin devouring behemoths that used to loom in dark areas, but it also is not so lenient as to allow the players to grind and continue infinitely. It can be a bit irksome to die against later enemies or bosses, as it will take time to reach them again in order to learn from them, but barring that Devil’s Dare is not that hard to pick up. The upgrades that the player gains allows them to continue through the coming nights, and often upgrading a special move increases the utility as well as the damage.\n\nWhen it works, the combat is fun. Part of this comes from the characters. While it may have been common to slightly tweak stats, maybe one special move, and the appearance of characters before, Devil’s Dare puts a lot of effort into making each character stand out and it shows. Each character is designed to play their role, so coordinating attacks in battles can be frantic but it engaging. Each character feeling so different increases the games’ variety and is great response to a common issue that even successful modern brawlers still face (Scott Pilgrim and Castle Crashers come to mind). Mastering each character feels rewarding, and that is no small feat.\n\nDevil’s Dare has some good ideas and is fun for a majority of the time. There are just a few issues and bugs that are holding. Seeing a good game suffer so much from some minor issues is worse than a game just being fundamentally bad. Knowing that it comes with its flaws, this is a game that could be great but is still enjoyable enough to be worth a look.\n\nEdit: After playing it again with 3-4 people, I have to say that the money doesn't scale and it is pretty awful for any more than 2 people. Yet another issue that quick update could eliminate.","December 22, 2015","true","22.0"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","19","21","7","0"

The game and its predecessors, Kung-Fu Master and Renegade took arcades by storm in the mid and late 80s, exposing that generation’s teenagers to gratuitous violence. In these, a solid grip of mechanics, a penchant for avoiding damage and persistence in the form of a constant stream of quarters were the ingredients for a winning recipe. Devil’s Dare aims to recapture the genre’s pulpy stories and violence alongside the tension and frustration surrounding the inevitable game over.\n\nIn Devil’s Dare, you play as one of four convention-goers, magically transformed into their pop culture icon. Available are the girl in the mech, the sai-wielding youth who ducks and rolls like a Ninja Turtle, hookshot, a Master Sword and Triforce-emblazoned shield-wielding modern-day Link and a heavyset overall-wearing two-handed Axe-swinging man. Each has a unique skillset, including castable special abilities and varied playstyles.\n\nOne thing to be aware of, though: making progress in Devil’s Dare is hard. You’re tasked with clearing the world of a virus which turns normal people into mindless, dangerous zombies, which is an acceptably campy and cliché story for a game where the focus is on arcade-style combat. You’re able to choose which order you want to tackle each of the game’s four stages in, with each successive one being more difficult.\n\nCombat is highly skill-dependent, and you’ll often find yourself incapacitated and overwhelmed when learning the ropes. Learning to balance character placement, crowd-control abilities and your special attacks to get maximum damage output while taking as little as possible is absolutely essential as you do not want to die. Enemies come in a variety of maddening flavors, and the bosses can and will destroy any semblance of hope you had on your first handful of runs.\n\nDevil’s Dare is brutally unforgiving: if you can’t afford a continue when you die or haven’t purchased a rare Soul Token at the end of a level, your save is deleted and it’s back to square one. This pay-to-win mentality is a direct and painful hearkening back to you running out of quarters at the worst possible time.\n\nThe levels offer neat, diverse environments though the palette is exclusively muted shades of blue, gray, green and brown. A little disappointing as they tend to blend into one another as a result, but it does fit the apocalyptic feel. Fittingly retro video game music accompanies the onslaught, providing a pleasant backdrop for the cavalcade of blood and dismemberment.\n\nDevil’s Dare is a dedicated return to arcade beat ‘em ups of ages past full of familiar-feeling characters, opponents and music. It provides difficult and skill-based combat and a constant stream of challenging encounters that will prevent you from losing interest. The lack of online multiplayer in favor of local co-op only, while authentic to the arcade experience, is a saddening exclusion. Still, it’s a rewarding, nostalgic and tough experience.","July 18, 2015","true","7.4"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tetsuo9999/recommended/279580/","Tetsuo9999","Tetsuo9999","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tetsuo9999/","251 products in account","Devil's Dare is a love letter to the 80's and 90's kids who grew up playing classic beat-em-ups like Final Fight, Double Dragon and Turtles in Time. The main twist to the formula is roguelike elements, but it doesn't feel as refined as other games in that genre. Players must acquire money from monsters, objects and kill bonuses, and said currency is used to purchase continues upon death, as well as upgrades at the end of a level. There are four stages to choose from, and the order they are completed in determines both their overall length and the boss fought at the end of the run.\n\nThe combat is standard beat-em-up fare with some modern additions. Each character has three special attacks that can be used as long as the SP meter is full, and the standard combo breaker move at the expense of a full SP bar. Dash attacks round out the moveset, and each special attack can be upgraded via post-level purchases. There is also a unique kill bonus mechanic where killing several enemies at once with an SP attack yields money and/or healing items. Mastery of this mechanic is probably what causes the discrepancy on this review page in terms of players saying that the game is too easy or too hard. A player who mastered older beat-em-ups will be able to use those old tactics here to get an abundance of money and healing items, while someone newer to the genre will struggle to get a run past the first level. The combat is nothing innovative for the genre, but all the systems work in conjuction with each other.\n\nSadly, the roguelike element of this game needs some work. Unlike other games in the genre, there are no unlockable items in this game; everything is unlocked at the start and there isn't a large selection to choose from either. This indirectly means that the game doesn't have as much replay value as the games it will be compred to. Character builds will always end up quite similar regardless of how many times you play through the game, and there's simply not much to do after unlocking both endings aside from achievements. I played this game for three hours and was able to learn the game, unlock both endings and fight all but two of the ending bosses, and there's not much else to see. I feel that it's best purchased during a sale where one wouldn't feel pressured to get tons of hours out of the game, but it's good for a couple runs. Each run is a little over an hour long, so it would probably only take 8-10 hours for the average player to see everything the game has to offer. Multiplayer runs apparently make the game harder since money management comes into play, but your mileage may vary with that as it's local only.\n\nOverall, I don't regret my purchase, but I do wish the game had more to offer. I have already seen 80% of the game's content, and I've also tried out the majority of the items in just two full playthroughs. Check it out during a sale for sure, but don't expect to dump dozens of hours into this game like other roguelikes.","December 2, 2014","true","8.4"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Feels restrictive, not to mention that some of them just aren't worth using, or can even miss, since two of them are used by holding a direction and pressing the button. If you die in a stage you can only come back if you spend money, and the cost goes up every time. Don't have enough or an item to save you, and your whole run is gone.\n\nCompounding this is that everything about the game seems designed to punish you if you make any mistake. Get hit by an enemy, and you're stunlocked for a bunch of damage unless you use a move that drains your special bar, keeps you from using them until it completely recharges, and is pretty unresponsive. Die in a stage and you probably won't get a proper upgrade for it. Even helpful things can screw you over, as a lot of the time I got hit because my character decided to pick up money instead of attacking. It feels like they wanted to take everything from the old arcade beat-em-ups, even the frustrating parts that were products of the time.\n\nIt does have an easy mode, but even then the game doesn't really feel fun or satisfying to play. This review is done from the perspective of single player, granted, but it's probably not all that likely you'd play it with others, since there's no online co-op. If they added some, maybe it would be more fun, but as it is there are beat-em-ups on Steam already that do grant that option, like Castle Crashers or Double Dragon Neon. I'd try one of them before this game.","April 13, 2015","false","1.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

It takes me back to the days of Final Fight, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, Alien vs Predator and even Streets of Rage. Yes the game resolution could have been better ( I think it's only 1024x768), but maybe they'll upgrade that at a later point. If you look in the leaderboards section - there is a coming soon part - for another game mode - updates will be coming our way!\nThe game is the story of a bunch of cosplayers at a gaming convention caught in a zombie apocalypse. You can choose between 4 characters + 2 unlockable ones ( I have no idea how to unlock them yet, probably need to beat the game or something). The characters are really different in what they offer in gameplay and combat style as each of them has really different "special moves". The special moves are the keystone of the game - to perform them you use a resource called SP (soul power or something) that's replenishing over time or you can gather it from the corpses of your victims ;)\nNow the twist of the game is, that you only have one (1) life. When you die you're presented with a question - can I pay to be revived right here, right now or you could use a Soul Token (that you bought earlier), that will respawn you at the beginning of your current level. So money is really important - and you make it by killing stuff in style. Killing in style is achieved by vanquishing mobs with a special attack and is indicated with a satisfying Fatality banner on top of the victim's corpse. So you need to perform as much Fatalities as u can - hence the different playstyle with the characters and their different specials.\nManaging your money is always important - once you complete a level your presented with a choice - do I buy a power up that will help me fight better, do I buy a Soul Token for a second chance, or do I keep the money so I can buyback right back into the action.\nOnce your out of money and out of Soul Tokens - you hear a very nice "Game Over" (for me this is a "Street Fighter - The Movie" game reference ) and your save game is deleted and you can start all over again.\nThe combat is really fluid and totally enjoyable. You should restrain yourself from key mashing and plan your moves ahead so you can stack the zombies and achieve greatness ;)\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this game and can only imagine what fun is it to play it with a friend side by side - reliving the good old arcade days.\n\nTL:DR or you want to see me and the game in action - check my first impressions video - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=330180336","October 23, 2014","true","3.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Die without having enough money and it's Permadeath, have the cash, and you can revive to fight another day.\n\nVisually, Devil's Dare is a 2D side scroller that looks and feels like a classic 90's beat'em up game. The retro feel is nostaligic for those of us who grew up with these games, and there are easter eggs throughout, referencing stuff from the 80's and 90's including the TMNT.

There's a very slight learning curve but the game is no where near as hard as some players claim and I certainly didn't find the ai mechanics "cheap". Beat this in the first sitting with $20,000 coins to spare (*note: coins earned through killing enemies, etc. are the means by which the player continues and purchases upgrades for their chosen character.

It's not dark and gritty though, it is in fact full of references and a bit of silliness. Not really funny though, they are just there to be there. Devil's Dare is made for coop (no online) but is perfectly playable solo and you will initially have four characters to choose from while two more are unlockable. They are all nerds transformed into warriors by Navi from Legend of Zelda and all play pretty differently from one another. Kingstone has a golden axe and is slow and strong, he is capable of summoning lighting, as well as shoulder charging enemies. Queenie fights in a giant mech and is able to freeze enemies and use bombs. Jackson is very fast but barely causes any damage and is able to judo throw enemies across the screen and use a flying kick.  Last but not least is Axel who is a jack of all trades, wields the Master Sword and is able to throw a spear chain to drag enemies to him.\n\nThose special attacks can not be used indefinably as using it will cost you one or two bars from your four bar SP meter. It recharges slowly or can be filled bar by bar through defeating enemies. That is something you actually don't want to do if you don't finish them off with a special. Defeating an enemy with a special move causes a “fatality” which causes them to drop money and money is very important in this game. Killing three or more enemies will cause them to drop a health item which makes it a rather easy game. So controlling the crowd is even more important in this game than others of the genre. Annoyingly enough rolling out of the way causes you to lose an SP bar for some reason. Even if the enemy is already knocked down and is no threat at the moment rolling will take off a SP bar. There is no other way to avoid attacks. There is no jumping, parrying or blocking, and insanely enough the run button is the same as the dodge which means  to run you will first dodge out of the way using up an SP bar and only then you can run for a while. You can rebind keys but you can not separate those two from using the same key. It may sound like a petty complaint but is actually quite annoying given the importance of being able to pull of a special attack but having to wait for it to refill.\n\nGetting hit is very brutal in this game. One hit and you will be stunned while enemies combo you into oblivion. You can escape by sacrificing all four bars of your SP bar to pull of a special attack to escape from their grasp. Most enemies take plenty of time telegraphing their attack so you will have a lot of time to roll away from harm before anything happens. Enemy variety is quite decent ranging from your typical zombie to a pregnant women that flings undead babies at you. There is one slime like enemy that if it manages to hit you will reverse your controls. I absolutely hate that in video games. Stun me or whatever but do not mess with the controls. Especially if your games controls are already subpar to begin with. It is hard to explain just what is wrong with them but it feels like there is a very big delay in the time that you press a button and the time it takes for it to register. It's not gamebreaking but in all my time playing I have not stopped noticing  it. Another problem is that the pick up key is the same as the basic attack so if you are attacking an enemy and move near money you will break your combo, bend over to pick up a few dollars and get a shiny new bite mark on your ♥♥♥. He will also pick up money over food oddly enough.\n\nThere are 4 boss fights in this game all from popular 80's films and are pretty fun to fight. Not much of a challenge by itself though. There will always be a unlimited horde of zombies attacking you during boss fights so I found it best to just ignore them unless I need health and focus on the boss. If you need extra challenge there are 3 difficultly modes to chose from, the first “Casual” will disable achievements, “Classic” is best suited to start with, and  “Expert” features some special different colored enemies that can not be stun locked. Expert gives you the choice before levels to make monsters and bosses harder for extra reward but that just means you can't stun lock them and didn't really add much. Boss fights are were most of the challenge comes from and are all pretty entertaining to fight though there was one instance where I glitched out of the level on the last boss fight which was infuriating though did not happen again. They also give you a limited amount of time to fight the boss and if you surpass that time you will automatically die so hopefully you have money left to respawn. It usually doesn't take that long to take down a boss if you ignore the grunts and head right for him but with lower damage based characters like Jackson it can feel like an unnecessary nuisance. Like every other enemy you should try to finish the boss with a fatality for a big cash reward at the end.\n\nOne of the most unique features of this game is that you can choose any of the four stages to play right from the get go. The longer you put off a level the more nights (sections) it will have. The first stage you pick will only have one night, the second will have two nights, third will have three and so on. That is a really cool feature that adds plenty of replay value if you want to see all the stages. It also means you will have more encounters with that stages boss. If you were disappointed that everyone's favorite alien was a push over, just save his stage for last and you will have much better encounters with it. None of the stages look interesting visually though and are all quite cliché. Stages are “Sewers”, “Train”, “Hallway” and “The Road which are every bit as boring as they sound. Something that they pull off constantly is throw waves and waves of enemies at you before you get to move from that  screen space, to mask how short the levels are and it makes it feel tedious. The brown filter that they added over the game makes everything look dull and lifeless, it really contradicts the goofy nature of this game as well as makes it look terrible for no reason. After a night is over you get to  purchase a upgrade like more health, longer combos, a soul token that lets you continue from the last night if you lose. One cool feature is that each character have some of there own unique upgrades special to him/her like upgrading a Molotov special attack into using a flamethrower. The two unlock-able characters use guns instead of melee and after a certain amount of shots they need  reloading. Can be slightly annoying opening crates and trying to pick up items only to lose a round by accident.\n\nBe warned, if you want to face the last fifth boss and get the good ending you will need $6666 to face him. There is also a survival mode which pits you against waves of enemies that get stronger with each wave, it is a nice little addition if you just want to have a quick game. Devil Dare's soundtrack ranges from decent to amazing and I enjoyed it very much. Voice acting on the other hand was painful to listen to but I guess it fits in with the cheesiness of the game. There is no long winded dialogue thankfully. Just small extremely cheesy quips during battle. Overall I did enjoy this game but it always felt like I was fighting the game itself more so than anything. From the need to finish enemies off with a special attack but sometimes not having any SP due to the only form of avoiding enemy attacks using 25% of the SP bar after each use to the wonkiness of the controls and the inability to cancel out an animation to dodge or attack another enemy approaching from the back.  It had potential but is ultimately held back from some rather odd design decisions. A few patches may easily negate most of my critiques but at it's current state at the time of this review the issues stack up just enough for me to not recommend.","July 24, 2015","false","4.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I get to the first boss of the first stage (sewer). He teleports around and summons zombies in so I couldn't beat him in the time limit.

That was mainly why I couldn't do it in the time limit because he teleports around too much.\n\nAnyway, get this: when you die and don't have the money to revive, which I didn't, you have to choose game over then it auto-deletes your save file as punishment.

Predator, ETC. That said do expect to find polish found in beat'em ups of 2000+, like Castle Crashers, Dead Pixels or Super Vampire Ninja Zero. In short it's everything you want in a brawler and then some.\n\nThe developers are active in the community and dedicated to their products. You can see evidence of this from the title screen to the end credits roll. Devi's Dare is a spiritual successor to Bitejacker (http://www.gamebrawler.com/2011/02/bitejacker-secret-base-horror-series-01/) also made by Secret Base, which is based on the game review show Bytejacker. This is development, I feel as a gamer you can feel good supporting. They truly care about the product, they care about the end user and on top of that, the game is just kick ♥♥♥ as all hell can be.\n\nKnow this, I'm leaving some goodies/pros out of this review, as they are just to awesome to spoil.\n\n• Pros:\nIf you are looking for high replay value, tons of game content, pick up and play action, rpg elements, episodic gameplay, beat'em ups, bad ♥♥♥ combo systems, polished graphics and animations, easy controls with complex gameplay, supportive developers, unlocks & secrets, multiple endings, great music and effects, or even local multiplayer, well then stop reading. Buy the game and play :rbiggrin:\n\nI beat the game today on my third attempt. My final play was about an hour with a break for some nom noms. My advice is rage mode on the bosses. Seriously don't be afraid to go Viewtiful Joe on those bawses, hitting that special as many times as you can, throwing a random normal blow to keep the meter going.\n\n• Temporary Con:\nThere are some bugs, but this is early release. What's funny is the bugs I've encountered are stuff like from SNES/Genesis era. Like a enemy walking through a wall, or your player getting stuck off the screen but being able to special back on (thankfully).\n\n• Wishlist:\nBonus/Side Mission: Perhaps a door opens somewhere on the screen, you enter and have to complete the mission, then you start back where you left off, if you complete and survive the side mission.\nRescues: Like in Bitejacker, perhaps gaining extra cash or an item on successfully protecting the victim until level exit.\nOnline multiplayer\nHardcore Mode :czombie: :rbiggrin: :czombie: No restarts, continues, ETC.\n\n• Final score: 9\nGameplay 10: Pick up and play, easy controls with the freedom of a complex combo system. Lots of content.\nReplay Value 10: Unlocks, secrets, achievements, alternate endings and my favorite an Survival Mode!\nGraphics 10: Clean and crisp. Classic feel without shoving it in your face. Nothing about It feels forced, everything about it feels just right. Like Metal Slug.\nMusic 10: Spot on, great ambiance, music always seems to fit the scene.\nSound 9: Sound was almost perfect for me.

It seems like every attack you make leaves you open and requires a bit of presicion timing to master. The hit box system can be a bit unforgiving at times, if you get juggled by enemies, kiss your ♥♥♥ goodbye. It's a bit infuriating that you only have a single life to complete an entire stage and if you run out of cash or didn't take the proper upgrades, you're basically in a stalemate and need to start all over again. :/\n\nOn the other hand if you hack your money via cheat engine the entire game becomes trivial and it's where the real fun is to be had.... Infinite continues, no consequence and just button mashing mayhem... so it's a bit of a design flaw, but I'm not really complaining as it made the game a lot more playable.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit too simple for my liking as well (Not even a jump button - so this means ZERO aerial moves) Like WTF? >.< Who designs a beat 'em up game without a jump button or some small platforming elements like jumping over pits? In a game that throws everything and the kitchen sink in for old school references then skimps out on a simple jump feature is just mind boggling... seems a bit lazy.\n\nThe game can be a bit unstable at times, I've had the game just go bonkers on me during a couple of boss fights. The music will cut out and make some annoying noise, if this happens the boss will just disappear off the screen and you'll have to quit out and reload as there is no way to progress.\n\nAnother gripe is no online co-op... only local... I mean did we learn nothing with Scott Pilgrim? In todays age, no one has real friends, just people they know and use when they need something. :P Why not implement the convenience of online co-op? Any game without this feature in todays age is just a failure in my books. Especially a small indie game like this with 2D graphics... is it really that hard to implement some net code?\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nIt's not worth the price of admission until they fix some bugs, add more features like online co-op and just re-balance some of the item costs and character abilities. I also wasn't a fan of the RNG at the end of the stages for power ups, sometimes you're left with really undesirable choices AND you have to pay for the stupid upgrade... It's annoying if you can't afford them or just don't want any of the upgrades listed.\n\nUnder the current circumstances, I just can't justify recommending this game at the current 12+ dollar price tag. In this state it's worth like 5 bucks. Thank Goodness River City Ransom Underground is just around the corner, it's going to be a retro beat 'em up done properly.\n\nGood attempt but this game will just fall in to the recesses of obscurity and no one will care despite the effort put forth... a shame really.","October 26, 2014","false","6.9"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","13","25","2","0"

And there's no part of that sentence that I don't love.\n\nThough I'll say right now that if you're playing in single player, you're in for a rough ride. There are moments in the game (especially bossfights) that really feel like they require a team effort. Or at least somebody to run defense while somebody's on offense. Which in a way, really adds to that old arcade charm. (though it's local co-op only)\nIt also features a permadeath system that's really going to hurt. You can buy an extra life, but it's expensive. On the bright side though coins usually aren't too hard to accumulate before the bossfights, and you can also buy continue tokens. Money management is a big part of the game, so spend wisely.\nIt also has partial controller support, but I was playing with the keyboard so I can't give you much information on that. It's just oldschool right/left/up/down, attack, special. No complaints there.\n\nThey recently added a "casual" mode that's a little more friendly for the single player. However, it WILL MAKE FUN OF YOU FOR IT. When you reach the end, it basically just gives you a big ol' slap in the face and says you don't get the real ending because you're a casual.

I beat the game and got the "good ending" on my second playthrough with a total of 2.1 hours played. I'm not particularly good at brawlers, nor do I play them a lot, but I breezed through classic arcade (the toughest difficulty) in single player with almost no resistance. The game only requires you to master two skills: herding enemies and using your stunlock/knockback skills effectively. Since both of these skills are essential to any brawler, it's far too easy for moderately-experienced players to quickly beat the pants off of this game.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed this game for the two hours I played, but until they add in more difficulty options I can't recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge. If you're crummy at brawlers or you just want to enjoy some mindless couch co-op with friends then it'll probably give you your money's worth; if you cut your teeth on unfair arcade brawlers during the NES/SNES era then you'll blow through it like wind through a screen door.","November 19, 2014","false","5.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I grew up playing games like Double Dragon and Golden Axe with friends. This appeared to replicate the feel of these game and add in-jokes to films and retro game characters. I purchased it at £7.99 thinking I was bound to get my monies worth and I love supporting Indie games.\nHowever, when I loaded the game up everything seemed far from polished. My Xbox controller would not work even though this is clearly an arcade game. I had to go into settings and map the keys. Okay not the end of the world but still a bit of a pain, Then I chose my first character playing solo (Golden Axe) on the sewer level he seemed okay once I got used to the moves via the tutorial and my adventure began. Having the screen set to full screen I wandered around killing mobs. This was quite fun and I found I could get food by doing certain moves at the right time. A few traps got in the way but nothing that couldn't be avoided. Then I got to the boss (The Fly basically). He seemed challenging but I wasn't expecting a walk in the park (as I knew this was old skool). I dragged him to the center of the screen to hit him. Then he started getting harder as they sometimes do and after dying for the firts time I realised he was able to fly out of my field of view and shoot me. I had to follow him into the dark and try and hit him. This was mostly a failure and I died. After experimenting a bit more with the game I realised that for some reason the game settings mean I can't see what is going on the left and right hand side of the game. Basically I will be unable to beat any bosses alone whilst this exists and this game is just another pointless number in my collection.\nEven if this was fixable I think I would find this game un-inspiring for the price and would rather play some of the other old skool beat 'em ups like the Double Dragon re-boot or the Sacred attempt. Sorry for a negative review but that's just the way I feel, disappointed...","October 26, 2014","false","1.0"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","16","34","0","0"

The game does a great job at parodying and paying homage to the games that proceeded it. It takes notes from classic beat'm ups such as River City Ransom, Streets of Rage, Ninja Turtles, etc. If I was to nail one classic game it resembles the most, I would have to say River City Ransom.\n\nThe game features an interesting combo system, rewarding the player for higher hit counts and an interesting perma-death mechanic. Gold in this game is used to buy revives, with out enough gold you die, your save file is deleted, and a kitten some where probably died because of you. It's not an easy game to say the least. The game has enough challenge to keep hardcores around, while remaining easy enough to understand that most can get into.\n\nThough I think it's obvious that I've enjoyed the game overall, it's not with out it's problems. There is no resolution option, and the game's default is rather low. There's also no auto detection for game pads, you must manuelly enter each command from the options menu. Not game breaking issues, but noticeable enough be mentioned. Besides some quality of life issues, the game is not the most responsive beat'm up I've ever played. It could be argued for the sake of game balance, but some times I get into situations where I have no options to avoid an incoming attack, even if I see it a mile away. As mentioned before, these long animation frames could be argued as game balances, but overall, it's more sluggish than most in the genre.\n\nThough the game is not perfect, it has enough charm and challenge, to keep most nostalgia junkies happy. Devil's Dare is an enjoyable light romp, that will have you giggling at the many many references to your childhood.\n\nPros:\n+ Excellent execution on it's style and humor\n+ A must play for nostalgia fans\n+ Fun and challenging combat\n+ Easy to understand, tough to master\n\nCons:\n- Quality of life issues (lack of resolution options, no game pad auto-detect)\n- Attacks can feel sluggish at times\n- No online multiplayer","November 4, 2014","true","1.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The problem with this game to me is that the time it takes to start a new game takes longer than it should. I think this game borders on the "rouge like" genre, when you die you start all over again with a clean slate. So the time to start a new game should be short and snappy so the player can jump back into the action! For example take the game Nuclear Throne, that games art and music are fantastic, but favorite part about it is how quick I can restart my game when I get killed. I really hope they can cut the restart time on this game short, and also I dont think the "delete saved data" text is necessary at all.

The animations are extremely well done, and it's very enjoyable.\nThe tutorial is well crafted and is the first level, although you have the option to skip it and choose from 1 of 4 escape routes to battle through.\nEach gets longer and hander as you progress and boss at the end of each.\nNothing says fun like bashing some face huggers in the face with a golden axe ( mop ).\n\nThe four bosses I've encountered so far are very challenging, and a lot of fun. You'd be hard pressed not to know where they're from or the references.\n\nStill the game mechanics, and music are brilliant. My only complaint is that the game is played in 1024x768, and running it in full screen results in a tiny window with black surrounding it.\n\nYou have 4 player local co op as well. Either on keyboards, or controllers. The game has partial controller support, which means you simply need to bind the keys in the options to what ever you one. I would strongly recommend it, as it plays very well with a controller afterwards.\n\nSadly, I'm terrible at the game, I've yet to beat a boss. Which means I lose my saved games.\nOnce you die you can pay a certain amount of gold to revive yourself. It start out at $1000, which you collect from killing enemies and performing fatalities. Once you've revived once, each consecutive revive increases the price.\nSo you're forced to perform awesome finisher moves to get the extra gold, or a much needed food drop.\n\nThere are also 2 unlock able characters, although, who knows what they are. As much as I enjoy the game, my skills might prevent me from unlocking them any time soon.\n\nEven so, if you're a fan of Streets of Rage , or Double Dragon this is a fun game to try.","October 21, 2014","true","0.9"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","10","27","0","0"

Combat is fluid and simple, game play is polished, and I didn't experience any bugs while playing; always a plus when playing an indie developed game.\n\nOne thing I really liked was that unlike other perma-death games, this one gives you a bit of a chance.  By finishing off multiple enemies with special moves, you can earn coins which can be used to either upgrade abilities or get an extra life.  Difficulty is interesting in that we found single player harder than multiplayer because of the dynamics of how co-op works, but that makes this an excellent local or online co-op game for the more casual gamer, while hardcore gamers will find exceptional challenge in going through single player mode.\n\nTotal play through time is about 2 hours, but the game has high replay value for each character or by taking different paths to get to the end.  Bosses aren't always the same and trying to figure out their weaknesses reminded me a lot of playing the old Nintendo Ninja Turtle Manhattan Project game.\n\nPros:\nHard game, but fun - feels rewarding when you finally kick butt and win.\nPermaDeath is forgiving (at least I consider that a pro)\nGamepad / controller support\nHigh replay value\nLocal Co-op and Multiplayer\nVery amusing humor and a good amount of nods to 80's and 90's video games and movies.  Good luck finding ALL the references.\n\nCons:\n1.5 - 2 hours to play through the whole game (but again, high replay value gives you at least 4-6 hours of gaming, not counting playing with friends).\n\nSometimes fights felt a little drawn out with the sheer number of zombies...but I imagine that's how it'd feel to fight an endless horde...so..kinda a con?\n\nI'm dumb, so it took me a few tries on a number of bosses before I finally figured them out.","October 21, 2014","true","0.9"," 7 of 23 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","7","23","0","0"

Here we have Devil's Dare, a beat em' up nostalgic game that has many fun easter eggs hidden within its levels for your viewing.\n\nThe overall gameplay is easy and fun to play with. It has set special attack combos for you to read or you can figure them out yourself. Many upgrades for you to choose from and a selection of achievements for you to try and unlock. Also two unlockable characters and two endings.\n\nI believe the game is worth the cost when it's on sale. With only 4 levels that you have to mix and match to defeat every last boss in, it gets kind of repetitive. That aside, I feel the game was well done and was enjoyable for the most part. I haven't 100% the game yet, but plan on to very soon. It's still fun to beat up all those zombies!\n\nFor those who like beat em' up games, this is a game surely for you!","December 19, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Full of references, little easter eggs, and a bunch of fan service-y type things. That said... it's not exactly a smooth game. The game controls very much like the original Double Dragon. As in, every action feels very deliberate, and somewhat clunky at times. Button mashing will get you killed. Not paying attention will get you killed. Poor placement / timing / usage of abilities will get you killed.\n\nDevil's Dare is hard, but not unfair. If you like, consider it the Dark Souls of beat 'em up games. Continues are hard won, and levels are usually beaten with a fraction of health left. You have to be smart about the perks you choose at the end of each level, particularly towards the end.\n\nI think one of my favorite things about Devil's Dare isn't that it's meta, but that it's meta about being meta, almost like it's mocking itself for referencing what it is. If you get the bad ending (and I did, at first), the game legitimately shames you for being so selfish / bad. It actually made me want to try again and again.\n\nI'm not sure what the solo experience is like, and quite frankly, I'm glad that it doesn't have online multiplayer. Timing / client issues that would happen aside, this is a couch / party type game, and I can't imagine it would have the same feeling / intensity online as it does when you're sitting next to friends, either high-fiving, or going "Ooooooh nooooooo~" with each other.\n\nLastly... This isn't really a pick up and play type game. If you play this casually, you will probably not have a lot of fun. This is something you sit down with a group of friends and say to yourselves, "Ok, this is what we're going to do. We're going to kick this game's ♥♥♥, or die trying. Repeatedly." It takes practice, patience, and a bit of dedication to learn how to beat enemies and bosses.\n\nAnywho... It's a good game if you're up for a challenge and are one of those weird people who has friends that can play next to you. Good luck!","March 15, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is worth its price (though I got it on sale). I think the content and the gameplay was good and it really takes some strategic thinking to avoid getting hit and to keep your HP healed up. If you're smart about it you can get through the entire game without dying.\n\nThere are two things that make me not recommend the game. Controller sensitivity appears to come either too high and you make movements you did not intend resulting in completely different special attacks or that you get stuck on environmental objects. Your character has to stand in place to swing their weapon so stopping to destroy and object when enemies are on your tail can be deadly.\n\nHonestly, what tipped me further into this direction is that I made it all the way to day 9 and was in an elevator level. I got knocked into a environment box and was clipped into the floor then transported back in time to get knocked off the platform and die. I can accept defeat from standing too close to an edge while fighting on normal circumstances but when it looks like I got glitched into that situation is just annoying.","March 6, 2015","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I highly recommend it.\n\nPros\n+4 initial playable characters with 2 more that are unlockable. All the characters handle very different and each character has their own set of 3 special attacks.\n+Risk/Reward upgrade/revive system. You collect money by finishing enemies with special moves. This money can be used for upgrading your character or for reviving yourself. If you die and you don't have enough money, you'll have to start the whole game over. If you pay to revive, the cost of reviving next time goes up.\n+If you manage to finish off 3 or more enemies with a single special move, you'll be rewarded with a health drop. This addition makes the combat much more strategic than most brawlers.\n+Depending on what order you choose the stages, you'll have to go play more levels of that stage to finish it. (EX: 1st pick is 1 level, 2nd pick is 2 levels, 3rd pick is 3 levels, 4th pick is 4 levels) The levels also have tougher enemies if you choose a stage later.\n+Solid replay value between the 6 playable characters, build strategies, stage order, achievements, and the expert difficulty's betting system.\n\nCons\n-No online co-op\n-The sprites are gorgeous but the color palette is exceptionally brown. I'm usually not picky about this but EVERYTHING is brown.\n-Your character will say something every time they use specials or pick up items. I got used to it but it's still a bit annoying hearing your character say "EASY MONEY" 5 times in 2 seconds when you're collecting money. Although the game has a voice volume slider, it controls both the players and the enemies. The game just doesn't sound right with both turned off.\n-The game only supports 1024x768 resolution. You can still play with stretched or barred full-screen though. Some people were having trouble with the game not displaying in full-screen how they would expect.

Devil's Dare is an arcade style beat-em up similar to older games like Double Dragon and that old arcade Shinobi game. Each character is based on different characters and series spanning other games likeThe Legend of ZELDA, Golden Axe, Ninja Gaiden, and some mech game that i dont understand the reference to. These pop culture type characters go up against olden day horror monsters of the silver screen with help from a loud mouthed Navi parody. Now gameplay wise it does have its flaws, but all the basics are here, amongst the mind numbing difficulty and permadeath. My one real complaint is the lack of online multiplayer, as i had nobody to play with locally, and actually doubt ill be able to find somebody to do so with anytime soon. This game is pretty solid for what its worth and i do reccomend it, although if you not good at this sort of game (like me) stay away, i could barely beat level 1!
