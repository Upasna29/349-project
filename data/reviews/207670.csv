The first levels were quite nice - nothing special and pretty far from what I expect from a "music game" at the same time, but still nice. Then I got bored. And then the final levels came. They are ridiculously hard - not challenging, just annoying and badly programmed. I found it impossible to finish the last one, but my masochistic mind told me to do it and get all the achievements. So I tried and I tried, and I tried, and I tried. And suddenly I had to thank the GREAT programmers of this FANTASTIC GAME because hey, you can pause the game and still link these damn notes! What a relief. What a joke.\n\nI finished the game and still got two achievements locked - "500 Notes", "250 Max". So I kept playing this "pause and link" game, making it my worst enemy... And then I found out the game is not saving your achievement progress. You have to launch it and keep playing it until you unlock these achievements. And guess what? Even they are bugged (I got it after over 600 notes were placed and over 300 max length chains detonated)...\n\nSo yeah, I wasted my time on this game as it ironically became a challenge to me and activated my "achievement wh*** rage mode". Don't let it do the same to you. :)","May 28, 2014","false","5.4"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","0"

It is an audio-visual sequencer puzzle game. That much is obvious once you look at any screenshots of it. It is bright, it is nice, it is confusing. Yes, confusing. See, the aim of the game is to add the required number of notes using these steps:\n1) to connect falling atoms of the same color\n2) using the white atoms to bridge different colors together (optional but longer strings equals higher points and more chances of notes to appear)\n3) detonate them before any of the atoms in the string touches the bottom (failing which the entire string goes *poof* and some notes disappear)\n4) chain up notes when they appear (notes act like white atoms) and reach the target\n\nThe confusing part? The background is nice and all but sometimes you can't see a thing and speed is of the essence here. There is 9 different stages and when beat, every stage unlock an infinite mode. However if you are aiming for the note achievements, take note that playing infinite mode refreshes your note count. Also, the game doesn't track progress for achievements so you have to do it in one sitting.","November 23, 2013","false","2.2"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

This review just got off on a horrible start.\nI mean for crying out loud. Bull ♥♥♥♥? That just ain't the right thing to say about a videogame, no matter how much I dislike it.\n\nLet's back the truck up and start over.\n\nAVSEQ is a audio-sequencer-puzzle-game. It's comparable to REZ (in the loosest possible sense). It's the kinda game you're supposed to play until you lose track of time and/or space. The day you quit playing a good puzzle game is the day your body quits on you.\n\nLet's start with what AVSEQ does right.\n-The concept is fine. Match colors to create fragments, collect enough fragments to unlock notes, collect enough notes to complete the level. If the colors fall too far you lose notes. Simple & effective, this is proper puzzle-game design.\n-In terms of playability, the game is functional. It's not like I suddenly lost control of the mouse or button clicks refused to register.\n\nWhat AVSEQ does wrong can't be adequately explained with bullet-points. Early on the game is in-offensive. This is a term I use to refer to "easy, boring, but still adequate entertainment". There is some satisfaction in getting the MAX color chains, and I don't know what else to say...it's pleasant to have around? After a few levels however the game turns into an RNG-fest. Falling-block puzzlers always have a bit of RNG to them. They work because you don't know the solution, yet you're given mere seconds to find it. AVSEQ starts becoming bull ♥♥♥♥ is when critical power-ups start appearing....and you need them.\n\nIt's easy to become overwhelmed in this game, so wouldn't it be great if a power-up that slowed everything down happened to appear? Look at that! There's one...and another one...AND ANOTHER ONE! Holy smokes you've completed the stage. Now wouldn't it be awful if a power-up that sped everything up w-OH GOD you just got a long series of them! There goes all of your notes, time to restart the stage. If you miss anything in this game, you're done for. You have the highest chance of success when RNG favors you. There's no rhyme or reason to the system. If you're doing poorly, you won't get bailed out by slow-downs and pauses.\n\nBut this isn't how the game gets you. The most frustrating aspect is that the cursor isn't large enough. When I'm trying to move from one end of the level to the other to catch those falling colors, there are no second-guesses. In those frenetic situations, I don't want to think "did i click on that color?" I don't have time for confirmation, because I'm focused on the next move. Due to the tiny cursor I start asking myself the wrong questions, and losing. This is what a bull ♥♥♥♥ game is all about. The slightest fix would make a dramatic improvement, and make the game far more playable. Instead, it practically forces the player rely on RNG in order to succeed.\n\nAnd if all that weren't enough, in terms of audiovisual design, AVSEQ isn't any good. For a game that offers too-high-to-be-a-real-number musical compositions, you'd expect to hear a single memorable tune. Instead, everything sounds assembly-line bland. Half the time it sounds jarringly out of place. Towards the end of a level, when the colors are falling like heavy rain, the music sounds so down-beat and dull that you just want to lie down and sleep. The visuals are a stark contrast, since they're loud and obnoxious. This is the perfect combination for losing track of colors, visual aids, and everything necessary to play the game at the high-level it attempts to demand.\n\nLook, I gave this game the old college try. If the RNG hadn't decided to stop doing me favors, I would have gotten all of the achievements. I'd still feel empty though. Is hitting a brick wall for a few hours worth it? Probably not.\n\nBull ♥♥♥♥.","November 10, 2014","false","3.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/recommended/207670/","maderschramm","Shotime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/","1157 products in account","This is a simple game, but I'm not really sure how to categorize it.  It's kind of a mix of rhythm, skill, and puzzle.  It's definitely unique, and I enjoy playing it during down time.  Basially, each level starts with a beat and fragments of notes will fall from the sky.  You match togetehr similarlly colored fragments into a chain of up to 8 pieces, and then release the chain to gather points.  However, the skill comes in as the notes are falling quickly and the chain isn't released instantly, so you need to time it out to make sure you don't lose the note fragments.\nAs the game goes on and you gather more fragments you gain "notes" that change the song of the level, slowly climaxing until the entire song is revealed, which I found to be quite well done.\nAs said, it's deceptively simple, easy to pick up, hard to master, and a lot of fun for down-time gaming.  It's not something you can play constantly for weeks on end, but as far as a "puzzle" game or other little skill game that sits in your library where you pick it up every once in awhile AVSEQ certainly fits the bill.  I would recommend any type of gamer to pick it up if you're looking for something to break the monotony every once in awhile.","August 11, 2013","true","1.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

(Also, nothing seems to display the time limit that I can tell on the UI.) A lot of the songs/stages are difficult to tell apart from one another, and the game just feels like a failure as a "puzzle" game, there's little rhythm aspect to it at all aside from "hit note before it crawls to the bottom of the screen" (and this is optional), and overall it's just not any kind of fun. The game would benefit from a demo to tell you if you disagreed with me on that last point, but they don't have one, most likely because THE DEMO WOULD BE THE ENTIRE GAME FOR FREE, even if it were a single stage.","October 10, 2012","false","9.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

Unfortunately this isn't the case.\n\nIt uses an RNG tune with RNG bonuses/penalties mixed in with the blocks. And unfortunately you can't intentionally miss penalty blocks (such as speed up) as that counts as a hit against you. So 1 hit against you vs 20 hits from a poorly timed speed up. Which might not be so bad if you had time to actually look at blocks to see what they do.\n\nMost of the time though I'm just scrambling to connect whatever before it hits the bottom and then get the wonderful surprise of a block splitting at the bottom and giving me 2 penalities. :D\n\nThe other problem is that the mouse curser is so tiny that if you don't get the connections perfect the first time, you don't have time to fix it and one or two mistakes is enough to keep you from passing the level.\n\nThere are endless modes of each level, but I'm not sure what the point of those is because they don't really help you in any way except to practice a level you've already finished.\n\nUnless they change something (which I doubt since this game is a few years old) I'd say just skip it.\n\nThere's better things you can buy for $2.\n\nEdit: Also, I'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but you can play the game while it is paused. I have Hold to select/Release to detonate as my control scheme, and I can select blocks while the game is paused.

The gameplay is extremely slow until the very last 2-3 levels, and I pretty much passed every level on my first or second try.  There's not that many stages at all, and there's pretty much no variation besides more dumb powerups that troll the hell out of you as you move along the game, but I can't really complain since I got this game for less than $2.\n\nSince the game has a horrible description, basically all you do is match sequences of colors and blow them up (your only buttons are mouse1 and mouse2), and basically gray coloured blocks are wildcards so you can match a lot of different chains!  Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe music is slow to the point where it wants to force you to go to sleep, although I guess if you enjoy minimalist downtempo music, then you would love to play this game.\n\nWOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST WATCHING A GAMEPLAY VIDEO BEFORE BUYING, EVEN IF YOU ENJOY DOWNTEMPO MUSIC, BECAUSE THE GAMEPLAY IS NONEXISTANT\n\nAlso if you're an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ like me, you won't enjoy this game because none of the achievements are hard to get besides the last two, because it forces you to play the game even after you've beaten it.

But when you're not, you'll just rage, because you missed that part of a second and your combo/score goes into the void.\nNice Game, for some hours.","October 17, 2012","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mostly it ends up feeling kind of frustrating and not all that much fun trying to string together combos out of things while trying to even keep track of what's going on in the first place. If the learning curve consisted of more than "beat your head against this until you get the hang of it" it might be more accessible, or if the feedback for what you're doing were better and didn't get lost in the clutter of everything else that's going on it might help, but as it is I'm glad it was free.","December 29, 2012","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
