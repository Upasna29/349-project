It's a "story-based" game, which is to say, the "game" aspect is merely a vehicle for literally everything else. It's technically a Japanese-style RPG, but the battles are a mere formality; combat rarely amounts to more than holding down the Confirm key until they end, with very little strategy except in rare situations, and even those can be circumvented entirely if you're of the mind and find the right items. I'm normally averse to these sorts of titles, a firm believer that a game that doesn't focus at least in part on its gameplay is a waste of a game, but LiEat appropriately made a liar out of me, and my annoyance with that fact is matched only by my gladness at being wrong.\n\nI didn't quite know what to expect when getting into this one, but I can say that whatever I could have guessed it was would've been wrong with room to spare; LiEat is surreal, strange, sometimes creepy, sometimes silly, yet consistently, if I have to admit it, charming. Developer Miwashiba uses each "game" to tell a tale of the ongoing travels of a humanoid dragon child who subsists off of the lies of the others, and her cynical, conniving, big fat liar of a caretaker, as they travel the land in search of the world's most valuable commodity: information. Our liar's muddy morality and views on the world are intriguing, and his foil is one of the most legitimately delightful child characters in any work of fiction I've encountered; rather than being smarter or tougher than you could legitimately expect her to be, she's reactive, naive, and even a little dense, yet without being grating, and while she's hyper-idealized, I'm willing to bet you're not going to care. I swear that if I didn't know my own kid wouldn't be the most insufferable thing ever just to spite me, I'd want one just for the off chance it turned out something like her.\n\nThis is all conveyed well by translator and localizer vgperson's mostly enjoyable interpretation of the games' quirky dialogue, the writing of which is consistently engaging and thematic. Like its plot, the original score is unusual, yet enjoyable, the setting is foreboding, yet inviting, the characters are mysterious and enigmatic -- save for one mentioned above  --  and the plot isn't fully explained. Rather than fall prey to being confusing as a result, though, the whole thing ends up interesting, and every interaction teaches you more about LiEat's strange world and its inhabitants, which is impressive given that each of the three extremely short games take place in one area each. There's little exploration, no adventuring, and no questing; you're presented with a self-contained mystery to solve, and the game is over as soon as the case is closed. Each game features at least one bad ending, and one "real" ending, and after the latter, you either move onto the next game after a visit to a gallery room, or run out of games.\n\nThe result is probably unlike anything you've come across, even among the independent scene. There's no soapbox for it to climb upon, no deep, hidden meaning for people to form a cult around and talk down to others over, no quirky fetishes to pander to, and no nerd culture to propagate; it's just a story of two people and the people they run into, but it was enough to get a couple legitimate laughs out joy out of this grouchy old fart, and again, this isn't even my kind of game.\n\nSo how much is a smile worth? Turns out the best ones are free, but three dollars was a fair price, too.\n\nI'd be lying if I said I didn't think that if you've read this far, you'll agree.\n\n* Note that I'd previously played this game from an alternative source, which is why my total time played is low as of this writing.","February 26","true","0.4"," 154 of 171 people (90%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","90","154","171","13","2"

Instead, I'll hazard to say that LiEat (I, II, and III) doesn't pander at all. Instead, the developer focused on bringing us a solid and well written story. The story itself isn't anything amazing, and often, the mysteries solve themselves in the first act. However, what really kept it interesting were the characters. The characters are endearing, mysterious, and funny.\n\nThe game includes 3 Chapters. Each has multiple endings. The first two chapters each took me about 1.5 hours, and the last one stumped me for a bit when I couldn't get the Good Ending.\n\nThe BGM are great and sets the mood as well.\n\nI highly recommend this to anyone looking to play a short game with memorable characters. Just don't expect this game to last you any more than 5 hours tops.\n\nEDIT: Also, any achievement that includes Ranma 1/2 is gold in my book: Happosai~!","February 27","true","6.8"," 60 of 69 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","60","69","3","4"

Cyril proceeds to leave with his brothers ( Not counting Leo ) and takes off via helicopter thus leaving Leopold and Efina in the rooftop, they both move on together to the next adventure...\n\nFinal Note:\nThis game is amazing and worth every single penny, I give it a solid 10/10 coming very very deep from my heart...\nEven if the game's ending is a massive cliffhanger that probably left some people in despair for a sequel, I guess it's not a bad idea to wait and have some patience, personally, I wish that this game gets a sequel anytime soon...","April 30","true","266.6"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","97","28","29","7","1"

There is no voice acting and the resolution of the game is pretty small which is a little difficult at first, the characters you meet and find will captivate you and the conversations they have always leave you wanting to know more of "why" "how" and "what". The combat system is really easy and simple so you don't need much experience or any experience as a matter of fact. I've never enjoyed a game like this in such a long time and its great to break off from the ultra violent toxic fps shooting games and just have a relaxing and cute playthrough a game like this.\n\nConsidering its only £1.99 , you should get it, this game has already made me laugh, intrigued and fascinated by the story and all the things to discover, I may also be in love with this game.","February 29","true","4.3"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","35","41","2","3"

Well, imagine you come across “Leo,” a caretaker, and “Efina,” a demon who is a lie detector, nourishing herself by eating lies. You would probably be in a rather awkward position, wouldn’t you say?\n\nLiEat is a rich story /JRPG game where you play “Efina” and her caretaker in three very well written short stories (LiEat I, II and III). Leo is essentially a con artist who is selling information from one town to the next and keeps changing his name and appearance all the time. Efina was born from a dragon egg; she has the appearance a four year-old child but she is only two months old. She call Leo (Hal, Theo, Albert and god knows what) “Papa” (father) due to the fact that he has raised her since she hatched.\n\nIn each location they visit, they will be faced with strange events, will investigate them and aim to find all the culprits. You will interact with interesting characters in each of the stories and even have the ability to read their bio’s at the end of each episode. I like that, as it really reinforces the thoughts behind all the characters in their journey.\nThere is a combat phase, which is not the big aspect of this game; it is easy and provides you with a little bit of respite between the reading stages.\n\nThe Pixel graphics lent the game a nostalgic feel, reminding me of playing on my colour Gameboy. Some people may find the low resolution a bit of an issue but all I can say is, do not worry about it. Great price point, only $2.99 for practically three games. No voice over in this game, however the soundtrack is good.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Three short and rich stories\n-	Interesting characters\n-	Nice Pixel graphics\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Combat phase could have been better\n\nLiEat series are well written and enjoyable to play (mostly reading).

The art, character designs and soundtrack are amazing, and I love the concept of it all though the story leaves room for a lot of mystery (there is a novel preceding the games that I have yet to read though; I imagine some insight lies there).\n\nEach game takes roughly an hour or less if you know what you're doing, or just bumrush through, but if you like poking every useless nook and cranny (or staring at character portraits endlessly like I do), then tack on another hour.\n\nI first played this series when it was still being tweaked, so I missed out on the cutscenes and bonus rooms, which make it all the more charming!

At the start of each chapter the two have arrived in a new location after assuming new identities, and are almost immediately thrown into some chaos as a local legend comes to life. By making use of Efi’s ability to materialize and consume lies, the two unravel the tales of the people and places they come across. In each chapter we’re also given a better understanding of Leo’s character and what Efi means to him.\n\nIn this world there are humans (who often do not look human by our standards) and dragons. Dragons are born from the wishes of humans, and their powers are shaped by the nature of the human’s wish. While I felt like I was presented with just a slice or two from an entire pizza, I did find the tidbits about the world juicy to nibble on. The character designs are inventive, and the colors used set different tones for each of the three games.\n\nThe soundtrack makes use of tinkling music boxes, bells, harpsichords, accordions, piano and more to create somewhat classical-inspired tunes. It’s not an in-your-face soundtrack but some of the tunes are quite catchy and most are great for the scenes they’re used in.\n\nWhile there may be some confusion about where to go and who to talk to in order to trigger the next event, the areas are small so being lost for any significant period of time is impossible. Each game lasts maybe an hour to an hour and a half, most likely less for anyone who has played the free version before (which are still out there, by the way, the Steam version is here just to support the dev with a few bucks). About the only thing I didn’t like about LiEat is that there isn’t more of it. Okay, okay, if I have to force out something negative, it’s that the battles offer no strategy or challenge at all. They’re more a means to an end, and the game would likely be just as good if they were replaced with something else or removed entirely.\n\nWhen all is said and done, I’m left impressed by the colorful world and some of the especially nice touches that you typically wouldn't expect from little indie rpgs like this. Despite the short length, I felt attached to the characters. Hopefully there will be more entries into the LiEat world.\n","April 8","true","5.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","14","15","3","0"

LiEat falls squarely in that realm with it's low asking price and unique charm.\n\nThe story isn't anything complicated that you'll need to sit and think about, and there isn't any powergaming to worry about. LiEat simply exists as a platform to tell a unique story that I think many people would get some joy out of.\n\nThere are minor RPG elements in the game, but really more than anything they only exist to carry the story to it's conclusion. There are multiple endings to the chapters, and some extra achievements and scenes to unlock if you're a bit of a completionist. In the end, however, LiEat is something worth taking your time with and simply enjoying rather than looking for the quickest way to get to the next stage.\n\nThe spritework and CG art are absolutely phenomenal, and the small bits of animation here and there breath a lot of life into the characters and the world around them. The music only further adds to this.\n\nAll in all go into LiEat with an open mind. I think most people will find it worth their time to play. It's one of those games where I'll look back on it and fondly remember it for standing out as something unique in my library, and not something that I simply 'finished'.","February 26","true","1.2"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","0"

The game has three parts that come with the single, $2.99 USD purchase. Think of it as three different arcs of a story, just separated to show a jump in time.\n\nThe characters in this game are fantastic. Every character you meet is unique and memorable, even if you only meet them once, they even have their own profile to discribe them.\n\nThe music is fantastic. Even if the main battle theme "Liar" is remixed in each part, it still sounds wonderful.\n\nThis game is not difficult, nor is it meant to be, considering you can find weapons that raise your attack to 500 and your level will never exceed 20. But that's ok. Because this game is a short, fun game not intending to test your full Atlus game skills.\n\nSo why should you get this game? Because it's short, cheap, fun, and good.

I'm sure glad my curiosity got the better of me. While short, it's a very captivating and interesting story. My only wish is that it should have had 1 or 2 more installments before the finale.

It's an rpg about a mysterious con man and his little dragon girl, Efina, who has the ability to eat people's lies. They live in a world inhabited by "dragons" and they go from town to town solving problems acting as detectives( since Efina is basically a lie detector), all the while the man sells info for cash. Humans and dragons have a rough relationship with eachother. Dragons are sometimes seen as slaves, however they are allowed to be in positions of power and allowed to live among humans.\nThe "dragons" in this game aren't dragons in the traditional sense. They are still born from eggs and each can breath fire, but they are human in appearance and each is born from wishes. They each have a special ability based off of the nature of the wish.\n\nThe characters in this game are likable enough. The con man, who gets several diferent names throughout, is your typical rogue with a heart of gold who still wants to help people but usually at a price. He tells lies, but with good intentions. Efina is a cute, naive, dragon-girl who sees the con man as her father. Her power is to eat lies as mentioned above. She wants to help her father stop lying one day.\nThe side characters are mostly just there for world building and to help Efina understand her powers. There's the police force captain, Captain Neill, who is also a dragon and he is just your generic captain who is stern and helps people. The vice captain, Brett (also a dragon), is a little more angsty and hates humans. Each game has its own set of characters for that game's story obviously.\n\nThe art style is consistant and cute. It's pixel art with a chibi look to it and It's styalized in a sort of fancy gothic way. Everything has a dark outline and it's just nice to look at. The two main character get diferent outfits for each story and they fit pretty well with where they are. The music is pleasant and fits with the setting. However, it's not very memorable by itself. There is also a problem with the music and the cutscenes. When a custscene plays the music will often just stay the same or keep playing even as the cutscene is happening. So something might be happening in the cutscene but the music doesn't help portray it very well.\n\nThere is also something to be said about the rpg elements. You get the basic stuff (switching items, leveling, looting, etc.), and you fight enemies. But the enemies aren't random encounters, they often just appear as you progress the plot. There are enemies that you can fight over and over however to level up. But there really isn't much need to, as you just get the levels you need during the story anyway. You get rewarded with money from winning battles. But as far as I can tell, there is nothing to use the money on so it's ultimately pointless.\n\nThe game isn't very difficult and is more just about the story. There are multiple endings to each game depending on what you do. To get each ending you just have to do one or two things diferently. There is a detective element as mentioned above, where you have to figure out wether lies are actually lies or if they are the truth, but there really isn't a punishment for guessing wrong so you can just guess until you get the right answer. You can also just find items by looking around that can make you completely overpowered to futher drop the difficulty.\n\nThe game is also very short. Each story can be beat in just under 2 hours at most. You could probably get a little bit more time out of it to get all the endings and achievments, but you just need to use an old save to do that unless you want to play through it again.\n\nHonestly though it's an alright game for the price. Short and sweet, not to difficult, and just plain cute. It does have flaws just mechanically but nothing that gets in the way. If you have a few hours to spend I'd say give it a try.","March 16","true","4.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gakkgakken/recommended/373770/","gakkgakken","The Noble Scout","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gakkgakken/","729 products in account",""Lies is like a box of chocolates. You never if they contain reasons or ugliness."\n\nMade with the freeware WOLF RPG Maker and translated to english by vgperson, hits LiEat now the Steam store bundled up with all the three stories into one big game.\n\nThe game is divided into three stories taking inspiration from folklore and bedtime tales where you play as the dynamic duo  featuring a big time liar and con man Leo/Hal/Sid and his trusty young dragon companion Efi, wandering from town to town, gathering information and eating lies, Efi's dragon power.\nThese games focus on a pecculiar form of detective work that could be envisioned as a fullblown franchise if it got developed even more, although cut low since it's by one guy.\n\nBearing joyful plots and the use of it's inspirational sources, not only strikes LiEat on the writing of the world, but of the characters.\nSee, the two main protagonists here are on their own fleshed out quite good, dipping it's toes into terriories like on how being different, the xenophomic nature held up to a more leviated species, conflict of how to lie for a just cause and show that individuals either a different breed, line of work, interest and stances should't trace back to the majority because the lack of contexts of action.\nThe true nature of lying as a crux can show how far these things can stretch before guilt manifests and swallow one whole on various levels, which is why it's interesting to see several of the characters makes up their own reasons by protecting somebody they love in almost all the instances of the series. LiEat is a nice spin on fronting, even enforcing truth in this by implementing that core element.\n\n\nThis isn't the only anchor point, but the distinguising artstyle using spesific coloring sets to separate the stories from one another along the semi minimal moe Final Fantasy-esque drawings displayed through either still images, animations or pixels. This isn't bad, as a matter of fact the creator must've known the doodliness works effectively here compared to his other art pieces (see KADOKAWA and v flower project).\nCharacter designs are indeed good looking, however I cannot say it goes along with the environment cus the bits limit. It does however act lively, rich and blooming. Too bad this got killed due to the indoor enclosements in both II and III.\n\n\nAlbeit an interesting detective fantasy RPG game, it's a working mess.\nI know from past experiences with the same engine that they're heavily scripted as well as ment to drive the plot from point to point exploration and dialogue exchangement (mainly notable in LiEat III).\nThere's other things lacking like an options menu for resolutions and fullscreen, even though the F4 and F10  buttons would do that for you, but it would be nice to have a volume control incase you want to listen to something else than the great loopy BGM.\n\nSpeaking of sound, the tracks aren't the casual midi chiptunes pumped into a low functioning rpg game, but it sure hurts listening to the orchestra through on stereo. At some intervals, the sound just drops while there's tension in the dialogues or switches over to generic ♥♥♥-ambience stock sounds.\nKills the mood.\n\nMoney is unecessary, since there's no vendors nor merchants to sell stuff to since the games stories are estimated 1-2 hours long, counting with grinding to simply slay everything with cheap tactics and become invunerable to "bosses" at the climaxes.\nSporting a very nice hud for textboxes, the text itself appears out of center with additional quotation marks when characters speak. The weight on the text and the character avatar presented thus making it feeling overwhelmingly unscaled.\n\nThe game finishes in multiple endings, and whenever completed, the player will be treated with a gallery as a reward featuring short bios of characters, the BGM you can mess around with, and gallery frames of still images and animations from the story for viewing leisure.\n\nAdditional Steam bonuses like easy-to-get achievements and trading cards comes with, but if you want to experience the games without supporting Miwashiba's chibi gothic adventures, then see here: http://www.vgperson.com/games/lieat.htm\n\nI'm not gonna lie, it's not a bad game overall spite the complaints, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is it a functional cluster. Give it a go if short games are your jam either of laziness or long working days.","March 5","true","7.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

If you're a fan of such games as Ib, The Witch's House, Alice Mare then LiEat is probably a game meant for you. Although it isn't quite horror oriented other than for mild body horror, it is a very story-driven game, which focuses on two main characters, a con artist named who goes by many names and a dragon girl named Efina.\n\nThere are 30 Steam achievements for this game, most of which can be found on your first playthrough if you're looking everywhere and talking to each character. Such dedication is rewarded with not only more information about our main characters and their history, but also different items, some of which make our heroes nigh impossible to defeat. As it might be evident of my high play time I sought out all achievements and replayed each chapter at least 30 times due to just wanting to explore on my own and uncover secrets without helpful guidances. However, getting the last few achievements proved to be quite difficult, so if you get stuck, be sure to look up vgperson's site, who translated this game, along with many other.\n\nThe graphics are adorable and the pixel portraits are very nicely done, so those who enjoy 2D pixelated graphics will definitely enjoy the game. The soundtrack is nice as well, it never seemed to get on my nerves or annoy me after listening to the music for hours upon hours. LiEat knows how to create atmosphere, whether it is to make things silly or horrifyingly dreadful, something which can definitely be experienced throughout the chapters, especially in the last one.\n\nTL:DR; If we want to go by Funhaus Spoole's view on the worth of games, which is 1 Dollar 1 Hour, aka if you pay one dollar that equals one hour of gameplay, then buying LiEat gives you more than enough content over 3 hours. As you can see I've gotten good 7 hours from this game just trying to complete it and get all of the achievements.\n\nHonestly, the game is just three dollars and if you really enjoy story-driven 2D games, LiEat is definitely for you.","February 28","true","8.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I kind of wish I'd seen a bit more of some of the characters though. Everything had that nice fairytale like feeling to it. Only problem I remember really having was that the game is not really challenging at all, except for a puzzle or two, but I don't think those were the main thing about it anyway.\n\nI'd still recommend this game, especially for the prize. It is actually 3 different games/episodes in the same package which means there is quite a bit of content to play trough. It also means the story had some good time to build up.","April 26","true","31.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The RPG combat elements are really only there to help lend a sense of player involvement in the story, and, as crappy as they honestly are, they serve their purpose well enough. The main appeal here is story, and let me tell you, it's quite good.\n\nThe game itself is very mystery-focused, and you'll find yourself feeling sort of like a detective as you try to uncover what's happening and which characters are the culprits of various crimes in each of the three episodes. While the mysteries are nothing mind-bogglingly ingenious, and it can be unclear at times where you need to go, they're generally well put together and suit the overarching theme of the game very well.\n\nThe characters are truly charming, especially the two main characters, who (amusingly) kind of serve as foils to each other. Learning more about them through their interactions with each other and the other characters is highly engaging, and I found myself surprisingly invested in their fates by the time the game's ending rolled around, which might I mention actually varies depending on your actions, and has the potential to CRUSH YOUR SOUL like it did mine.\n\nTL;DR -\nIs it perfect? No.\nBut saying it's not worth playing would make me a great big liar.","March 2","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It's my first time writing one. I usually avoid it, but I fell so deeply in love with this game that I just had to write a review.\n\nSecondly, this game is beautiful. The art, the soundtrack, the STORY! Everything just mesmerized me. Okay I have to admit, during the beginning half of the first "chapter" I was kind of reluctant about this game. But when the plot actually kicked into gear, I just kind of...fell in love. Hard.\n\nThird, let me just emphasize the story. It's great. I don't want to give spoilers away, but the ending truly touched me. Seriously though I wanted to just cry a lil when I saw the neutral and the good ending. I felt like I suddenly joined an army of LiEat lovers. I want fanart and fanfics of Leo and Efina! Although very certainly in this case, Incest is not wincest. Please. Don't do that to me.\n\nIn all, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It's worth $2.99. It really is. Although it's short, it's sweet. LiEat gives you that feeling of wanting more of it, but at the same time knowing that the game ended in the best way possible. STOP READING THIS CRAP REVIEW AND GO PLAY IT!

The story was good, but the Good End to LiEat III is like, mandatory. The combat wasn't too challenging and kinda boring, but easy to skip and wasn't a great bother. If anything, I liked it, despite the repetitiveness and all that; simply because the game is defenitively not focused on it and it assumes it.\n\nThe graphics looks nice, and the game truly has a sense of great detail. Like how the protagonist gets "Efi" in his "Likes" part of the description in LiEat III only, to show his growing affection. Stuff like that makes it very interesting to walk around and investigate stuff.\n\nAgain with the story, the moral was amazing. As a kinda liar myself (I lie when I think it makes things simpler/easier for everyone), it truly hit right in the guts.\n\nI highly recommand this piece of art. It's so cheap, too! You can buy ~20 copies of LiEat instead of a AAA game!

It's cut into three short chapters, and you should be able to get through each chapter in a matter of a few hours. It's a unique way to handle a game, but one that makes it fun to binge play in small sessions. I've already played through each chapter, am currently going through to get all the achievements, and plan to play it for friends in the near future.\n\nEach of the chapters has a unique story with colorful characters. Most won't be seen in all three chapters, other than the two main characters -- our alias-changing conman and Effie the dragon. However they'll definitely leave lasting impressions and are incredibly unique, so you'll never forget which characters go to what story.\n\nI highly reccommend this wonderful title! It's been loads of fun, and has shot up to be one of my favorite games in my library. If you have a few hours and a few dollars to spare, why not pick up this wonderful game? It'll pass the time and give you a great experience in the process.","May 11","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is presented as a trilogy, with each part having it's own contained story along with a deeper running plot that winds through all three and comes to a head in the final chapter. Each part's story is fun, and comes with an enjoyable cast of supporting characters to keep you occupied as you pester everyone to play with you. Besides a fun journey with characters I came to care about (impressive, given that I completed everything in under five hours) one thing I totally fell in love with are the achievements. They are often the punchlines to jokes in the game, actions you take as the player prompt the achievement to pop up with a rebuttal or quip about the situation, it's adorable!\n\nIf you are looking to get all the bad endings, my one suggestion is to stay low level until after you get the bad endings, if you walk into the final boss fights in each chapter at a high level it may very well become impossible to lose to the boss, who will miss or deal 0 to 1 points of damage.\n\nTotally worth checking out, and be sure to search everything and talk to everyone!","June 5","true","4.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But it's far more about the story than the game play, and well the story is pretty neat, it throws you in after the begining of the story really in to the meat of Act 1 which works well in this case characters are as fleshed out as they need to be and it gives you a sense of lore of this world which it continues to feed you bit by bit in each Act. The story as a whole is pretty good, gives you a fair sense of mystery pretty easily.\n\nThe actual game play is pretty poor, talk to NPCs till you hit a flag to progress and cut and paste turn based JRPG stuff, however thankfully all the focus of the game is placed on the story, they don't make any parts of the combat particularly diffucult and I should think there wouldn't be anyone who would have any trouble with it.\n\nI would highly recomend this, it's a quick fun story for only $3US","March 5","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Improbablysomeoneyouknow/recommended/373770/","Improbablysomeoneyouknow","Fohlen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Improbablysomeoneyouknow/","60 products in account","Please read the full review, this includes controls to the game that some players might not understand if they haven't fully explored them on their own.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWell, the game is definitely fun. I've played it enough to know a bit about it. I definitely enjoy the adorable art style of the game and how it was made. It's very well thought out when it comes to the story. For the most part it's about a con man and his dragon girl, Efina. Efina is abnormal compared to the other dragons in the world, as she has a different diet that revolves around, 'lies', lies are physical beings created when a character in the game lies. It's your job to determine which is a lie, and which is the truth.\n\n\nPros:\n-Really fun\n-Adorable\n-Great story, it's super fun to play\n-Characters act human like\n-Entering homes with the space bar instead of just walking in - This feels more natural to me than just walking into some place as if the door automatically opens for you.. I like it more.\n-Features a minor use of the mouse. Not many games do this, I kind of like it.\n\nCons:\n-Issues figuring out some controls, for newer players (like myself)\n-Fighting is a tad bit too easy in the beginning.. - Gets a BIT harder, by introducing something like an eight on two battle..\n-Some issues arise with the music, making it sound kind of.. Troublesome, and problematic to want and listen to. The looping situation isn't all that good, and definitely could've been better.\n-Clunky use of the Fn keys, it's all scattered around.\n-Problems with the FPS change.. Not really made for it\n-Sometimes when holding a button for a full second will cause you to instantly skip text you may have wanted to read..\n-Kind of throws you into the game.. Without instructions\n-English translation is still having some issues, but so far it's getting there, example is at the top.. It doesn't translate well... Or at all in this matter.\n-Really short if you rush\n\nQuestion:\n\n- Why isn't there a WSAD implementation into the game? Alongside the Up, down, left, right arrows? Kind of like Undertale has? It's possible to do..\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNow upon further investigation there's a few things not notted that I kind of wish were in the game fully as an, 'option' setting. See, the thing about the options is that they aren't fully labled. They utilize the Fn comands, such as F1, F2, etc. Now, not all are used but I will list the ones that are used. To help newer players figure out how to change around some things. Also not included inside of the game in any way is instructions on how the game plays\n\nKeys that don't do anything:\n- F1\n- F2\n- F3\n- F6\n- F7\n- F9\n- F11\n\nKeys that have use:\n\nF4 - You start with the default screen which can be too small to some users. Or too big. Press it once at the default size, and it'll grow larger. Press it again, it'll become small. Once more and you're back at the default screen size.\n\nF5 - The game itself runs at 60 Frames Per Sec. By default this is the source frames you're going to get to determine how fast the game plays. By pressing it once, the game will lower the FPS to 30 Frames Per Sec. Pressing again will lower it to 15 FPS. If you press it again, the game will bring it back up to 60 FPS, and it'll be the default speed.\n\nF8 - If you don't use the default FPS setting made by Steam to determine how many frames you're on. The game has a built in FPS counter that's VERY accurate. It works the same as the default FPS setting in Steam, and is just as accurate.\n\nF10 - If you HATE the default screen sizes and would rather play it in full screen, the game can be played in full screen by pressing F10. The resolution isn't bad, but it looks a bit better and makes it easier to see when using it.. Not sure why this key wasn't binded to the same one as F4. But, it still helps if you want it, just press F10 to go out of full screen.\n\nF12 - By default Steam utilizes a screenshot mechanic that allows you to capture games, this is useful if you wanna screenshot it.\n\nESC/X/Backspace - The escape key, X key and the Backspace button are all used to open your menu, this will allow you to swap items and view other things in your inventory.\n\nSpace Bar - Allows you to go through text, press it and it'll go to the next screen.\n\nUP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT arrow keys - All used for movement. Different from the WSAD movement, this game uses that.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSo if I was to rate the game as a game developer himself, I'd give at at least a 9.5/10. Now, I'm not one to call games out on what they are and if they have issues. But upon reading reviews, this is supposedly the first game made by this indie dev. It's a REALLY nice game despite the issues. I definitely enjoy playing it, and so does my lover. I convinced them to get it to play with me, they REALLY like it as well. They notice the issues, but it's definitely not that bad.\n\nI would really recommend the game because it's.. Nice, it's a very fun game, the character designs are interesting. I also should mention that there's use of drawn out scenes, which might I add are absolutely great to look at, it fits well and expresses differences in the characters. There was a use of one scene where one of the character's hair was blowing in the wind, and I thought it looked great. Overall. It's fun, it's clunky, but it's really nice.\n\nIf you want a game that's short, but has a nice background to it, with interesting characters, adorable moments, some weird moments, and extra stuff to it, I definitely reccomend it.\n\nNow, this is mostly a review from someone who has played only the first part out of three, but.. I can tell this is worth it by how much time I'm spending just playing it. Try not to rush the dialogue, or else you'll miss out on where you need to go. There ARE some spots.. Where you have to figure out where to go on your own, but it isn't too hard, search all the houses you know that characters are in, you'll find the next spot you need to go. Make sure to talk to them to get more dialogue.\n\nRemember, this is only a standpoint of me currently, and I don't think you'll be disappointed. The game is definitely worth more than $2.99. To me at least, it could be at least $3.99, but.. $2.99 for this game is a steal nonetheless. If it was longer I'd say bump it more, but I really hope this dev comes out with even more content in the future and continues to update and create a better translation to the game.\n\nTL;DR\nGame is great, read above for controls, definitely is different and it's really fun.","March 30","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played through all of it for the cute and amazing story, and the achievements. For the $2.99 it is worth it. It has three chapters composed of different stories. The characters aren't all the same, they actually have a background and a small story of there own, something that not all game characters have. Oh and I forgot to mention that the all three chapters have three endings as well.\nGood, bad, and neutral. And all three have a bonus room once you complete the good ending.\nI called this cute, but I think it needs a better word.

The battle system is merely there as an eye-candy. The story consists of three short arcs, each being very different and follow the same underlying theme. If you're new to gaming and possibly don't know much about the world, it's a good start. I find the game relaxing as it hardly requires not much thinking, really.","February 27","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Loved every second of it. LiEat is an excellent story-driven rich game with great character development and multiple endings for each of the 3 chapters. Art work and the short animations during scenes was well made. The music is nice but the game's strongest point is the dialogue. From the first LiEat, I wouldn't put down for even a second. The Second chapter  felt kind of lackluster but answered some of the needed answered questions. The Third chapter took my breath away as the trilogy has a brilliant multiple endings. Overall, It is well worth the purchase!","March 7","true","5.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pal_ind/recommended/373770/","pal_ind","Pal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pal_ind/","65 products in account","LiEat is a collection of three originally freeware short story-telling RPG made by △○□× (hereon Miwashiba) using Wolf RPG Editor, not too different from other story-telling experiences like Mogeko Castle.\n\nSince the story is the focus of the games, might as well talk about them. Each individual title is a mystery-horror set in a fantastical world where anthropomorphized animals and humans live. Aside from this there exist the rare "dragon" who are human in appearance but have horns and the ability to use magical powers. You take control of the party of the main character who changes his name and appearance in every game and her small lie-eating dragon Efina. Each game takes place in a different small location and presents a different situation and presents a different "mystery" to our characters with small touches of horror. The main character is a con man who uses Efina to get information out of people and then use it to sell to interested parties among other frauds, while Efina is just an almost newborn dragon who follows the main character everywhere. In each story we meet a colorful cast of characters, including some recurring ones that will shed some light into our main character's enigmatic past. While each story is self-conclusive and mostly unrelated to previous one playing in order is advised.\n\nThe gameplay is minimal in LiEat, there are RPG battles every now and then but they are pathetically easy and almost impossible to lose. You get a large stock of healing items found throughout the map and three sets of equipment (stronger weapons, armor and overpowered weapons), nothing carries over from one game to another but every equipment and item is laughably easy to obtain. There are multiple endings (bad, neutral and good/true) in each game with varying requisites but they don't add a lot of replayability since the requirements are simple and usually involve following a set of events in a certain order. At the end of each game you can access a bonus room with galleries, music player and character info which is nice. The games are REALLY short too, each story lasts roughly 45 minutes so the entire trilogy can be beat in 2-3 hours.\n\nThe game sports a pretty distinctive art style in both pixel art and event images. Each game has a motif color (red, blue and gold respectively) and character designs are pretty charming and cute. LiEat I&II have been updated to match the third game and now also have short animated cutscenes at key events. The music is nice, nothing that I would listen to outside of the game but suits the mood and is nice to hum while playing.\n\nLiEat is not the biggest masterpiece of story telling but I found each story charming and fascinating on their own. The freeware versions of each game are still available for download in many languages, so paying for the Steam version is pretty much just supporting the authors and getting the knick-knacks of achievements and trading cards. At the low price of $3 I found this to be acceptable and bought without regrets.","February 26","true","4.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BradleyBell/recommended/373770/","BradleyBell","Bradley Bo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BradleyBell/","49 products in account","If you like indie story-based RPG games, I'd highly reccomend trying out LiEat. It's a bit of a short game, only taking me about two hours to complete each of the games, but with the small price as much is to be expected. It can be at time creepy, but it's not really a horror game, so if you're looking for your usual RPGMaker Horror game, you won't exactly be crapping your pants every other scene, if that means anything to you.\n\nI think that this is one of those games where saying anything huge about the story is something of a spoiler, but to generalize it, the story follows a stoic young man and a happy dragon-girl that he come across not long before the first game, and each of the games follow the same pair, despite physical properties somewhat shifting. It's a bit odd, if the concept interests you even slightly, though, I think you won't be disappointed.\n\nOf course, you probably don't need me to spell it out to you, but if you're looking for strong gameplay, you should look elsewhere. The normal battles all pretty much play out the same, and the bosses only require an ever-so-slight amount of thought to actually beat. This isn't a gameplay based game, of course, this is only there to add the experience slightly.\n\nBasically, do you like story games? If yes, and you have a three bucks lying around (And really, who doesn't?), then I highly reccomend giving this game a try. If you're cold and heartless, a free version of the three games can be found on it's website, but it's obvious that Miwashiba worked very hard on this game, so don't be stingy and just give up the pocket change, believe me, it's worth it.","February 26","true","5.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","6","11","3","1"

During these chapters they'll come across challenges that ends up with having to to do some detective work, which results in going into battle to eat the lies in people's alibis. Along the way they'll be some recurring characters you'll learn more about and about the world around you. I'll try to keep this short and as spoiler-free as possible.\n\nThe story\nThe story, having three chapters, is actually a lot shorter than most RPGs. Each chapter has about the length of one short story, and yet is still capable of keeping you wanting to know what comes next in the further chapters. All while the story goes on, the game manages to inform you about the world and characters without falling into the pit of having too many exposition dumps. I mean, sure, they do have some, but doesn't all games at least have a few?\n\nThe characters\nThe characters are another big part of the game, giving the recurring characters life and background quickly, and still giving you immersion. Most of the characters are quite endearing, and has some quirky trait to make them stand out. I would agree that the game does have some holes in certain supporting characters, but these characters usually last only as long as the chapter.\n\nThe mechanics\nThe battles and mechanics are very barebone, with nothing special about them. In fact, most of the battles are just ways to move the story(thanks to all the enemies being physical manifestations of lies, and beating means said lie-eating dragon eats them). This doesn't mean the combat is bad, however. It's just very average and short-lived. Although the lack of grinding or needing a good strategy can be a bonus if you are more interested into the story rather than combat.\n\nThe soundtrack\nThe soundtrack is actually pretty good to listen to as well, espcially if you enjoy the sort of piano-and-bell sort of music. Add the fact that the most recent update to this game has let you listen to them through steam's music player makes the sounds track another bonus to this game.\n\nSide notes\nHere I'll be listing some bonus points, in case you care. The endings are mostly there to set yourself up to see the next chapter, but saying anything more would risk spooling the game. There's also bad endings, but luckily, you won't automatically run into them so long as you don't do something stupid like run into a back alley in the middle of the night. I also enjoyed the achievements, especially the ones that shame you for taking items that don't do anything out of people's houses just for the sake of taking them. And yes, there are trading cards.\nAdd this all together at a price of about 3 dollars, and you've got a good game.\n\nA list for the lazy people\n\nPros\n-Good story\n-Endearing characters\n-Good soundtrack\n-Trading cards\n-Cheap price\n-Funny achievements\n\nCons\n-Bland combat system\n-Relatively short story, won't last as long as more expensive RPGs\n\nI'd recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs with good stories, and have a few bucks to spare for it.","March 9","true","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

That's the only word coming to mind, at first I bought this, being the only thought of "RPG maker, I found some great indie games in this game maker." So I payed some birthday money... and\n\nWas introduced to a small girl and a caring, theiving father. Each dialogue, each person I talked to kept cringing me to want more and seek out what I truly wanted out of this game, however each time I did my mind just kept being answered and rewarded, the game was just so intreguing. Finally after 6 hours I beat each and every puzzle, took on every part of the corruption and fought my way to find the last amount, I came across such a intreguing ending and just... wanted more.\nThe game was only released friday, but I couldn't hold myself to buy this for my boyfriend (And steal his trading cards~!) and share this experience.\nThe puzzles themselves were odd, they had a plain sight and odd taste, but kept me going.\nThe music was one of my favorites, every sound track matched perfectly and I feel like I could download each indevidual one and listen for hours.\nFinally, the characters, art, and dialogue were by far the best i have ever seen. Being that this was made in such a simple engine, i found myself looking at cutscenes and cutesy art in the view of a small child, everything I looked at I just felt joyful taking in each sprite. I.. wanted more.\n\nPlease, if anyone reads this, I would love if anyone could point me at a game like this one, possibly a part IV or above, i just... want more.\n\nThanks for your time, and developers, keep creating such great games!!","March 1","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After buying LiEat, I've come to love it as my favorite game on my Steam library. You play as a dragon-gril, Efina, who can eat lies. When someone lies, it becomes physical and the enemy of the game are these lies. The combat is about as simplistic as it gets for RPGs. The short storylines are well written and the dialogue is humourous and touching. The world looks amazing and the artstyle and music fit with it perfectly. The world is also filled with a nice number of secrets and optional events that make it more lively.\n\nIn summary, LiEat is a perfect and quick game. The game is short but it is a joy to play every second of the game. If you're an RPG fan you will love this game. If you're not an RPG fan, the game is short enough to enjoy without overstaying its welcome. Definetly worth $3, you need this game.\n\nEfina best daughteru in the existence of all timespace","March 1","true","11.8"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The main characters, Efi and Theo, have an interesting relationship, the nature of which starts mysterious and becomes more clear over the course of the three chapters in a very satisfying way. While fairly short, each chapter has new character graphics (Theo and Efi recieve makeovers) and multiple endings to find. It took me a couple of hours for each chapter, playing casually and exploring.\n\nA note about the gameplay: The game utilizes JRPG style battles which are quick and easy to win. In my estimation, the battles are not there to present a challenge but rather to support the central conceit of the game (Efi causes lies to manifest in the real world, which she then eats.) without getting in the way of the storytelling. If you only enjoy video games that challenge, then you should be warned to approach this one with a more open mind or to move on to something else.\n\nI definitely recommend this game for it's original story, great characters, and adorable yet dark aesthetic.","March 19","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After buying LiEat, I've come to love it as my favorite game on my Steam library. You play as a dragon-gril, Efina, who can eat lies. When someone lies, it becomes physical and the enemy of the game are these lies. The combat is about as simplistic as it gets for RPGs. The short storylines are well written and the dialogue is humourous and touching. The world looks amazing and the artstyle and music fit with it perfectly. The world is also filled with a nice number of secrets and optional events that make it more lively.\n\nIn summary, LiEat is a perfect and quick game. The game is short but it is a joy to play every second of the game. If you're an RPG fan you will love this game. If you're not an RPG fan, the game is short enough to enjoy without overstaying its welcome. Definetly worth $3, you need this game.\n\nEfina best daughteru in the existence of all timespace","March 1","true","11.8"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

This game comes with all three LiEat games and is definitely worth the $2.99. As a League of Legends fan (boooo, says everyone...) I've come to use this game to play in queue because Rito Gaems has awful queue times. I've only played two games out of three, but I really, really enjoyed the two. I'm looking forward to completing the third!\n\nHere are many pros of LiEat:\n- Absolutely adorable characters\n- Very immersive story\n- Soundtrack for you\n- The music and game pauses when you minimize the screen/open something else (Perfect if you're waiting in some kind of queue for a MOBA such as League...)\n- Three games in one, little client\n- Quite a bit of replay value if you enjoy the games (100% achievement)\n- There are trading cards, backgrounds, and emoticons!\n- YOU CAN SAVE WHENEVER YOU WANT\n\n...although, you might want to consider these very few cons:\n- If you're a fast reader, you're going to get through these games quick. Luckily, as I stated before, there's a lot of replay value if you find this game fun.\n- The game will not full screen, it's a rather small window\n- It's great that you can save whenever you want...but you have to save constantly. You never know if a little lie is gonna wipe the ♥♥♥♥ out of your HP leaving you with 20HP...and you've run out of small candies to eat. And then wowie! you have to battle someone else. RIP Leo + Efi.\n\nOverall, this is a game I rate 10/10 because who doesn't love small dragon children?

It's hard to find a good JRPG that can be completed in a sitting or two, especially one that keeps you guessing with every moment!\n\nThe battle system is fairly basic, but it really isn't the focus of the game.  The story, however, is the main attraction.  The first charpter is fairly slow, but it establishes a good brackdrop for the next two.  Chapter two starts to thread some things together, making the overarching theme of "lying will always catch up to you..." come together a bit more clearly.  The last chapter deviates from the first two by diving into the main crux of the story almost immediately!  Great endings, too!  Some of them can be a bit tricky to piece together, but they are easily found with a bit of digging.\n\nThis is the first game I bought and played through almost immediately after I got it in a very long time!  I highly recommend this to anyone that is looking for a good short story and a fan to the JRPG genre!","March 28","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its got that same kind of charm that games like Undertale and OFF have. The gameplay is lacking, but the storyline is fantastic and more than makes up for this. It comes with 3 episodes, all of which can be completed within a few hours.\n\nThe story itself is dark however, there are plenty of funny and cute moments that lighten the game up a bit.\n\nMy only gripes about the game are that its pretty short, the levels are tiny, and that the gameplay isn't as deep as it could be. For instance, theres no use for money in the game, yet you earn it. Even something small like adding a tiny little vendor somewhere would make it feel more developed. The money feels like it was just tacked on last minute. HOWEVER you really don't need to buy anything since the game is so short and you find plenty of healing items and such. If they decide to release more LiEat, I would love to see this added if they extended the game and joined all the episodes into one bigger game with more areas to explore. It felt slightly claustrophobic being in such a small venue.\n\nFor its price, I'd HIGHLY reccomend it. I think I'd be willing to pay a little more to be honest. I found myself wishing I didn't finish it by the time I got to the end and every bit of it is enjoyable. Its easily a 4.8/5 and i'm looking forward to seeing what the developer comes out with next.","April 8","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each story is told like a fairy tale and each character is okay.  There isn't much depth in this game sadly.  You mainly play this game for the story since fights can only be encountered at certain times.  The battle mechanics are okay for the few fights you're going to be fighting.  There are no shops in these games (because this game actually contains 3 stories) so you'll have to be more explorative when wandering around to find certain things like weapons, armor, or consumables.  Since this game is story driven it would be expected to have decent writing and aesthetics.  This is true.  The story as simple as it was had me hooked.  The over arcing mystery of the main female's existence interested me to no end and I believe the music and art compliments everything well.  Gameplay and most cutscenes are in a pixel style and it looks nice, but there are a few cinematic cutscenes that are in an anime style and they look nice.

Each story is told like a fairy tale and each character is okay.  There isn't much depth in this game sadly.  You mainly play this game for the story since fights can only be encountered at certain times.  The battle mechanics are okay for the few fights you're going to be fighting.  There are no shops in these games (because this game actually contains 3 stories) so you'll have to be more explorative when wandering around to find certain things like weapons, armor, or consumables.  Since this game is story driven it would be expected to have decent writing and aesthetics.  This is true.  The story as simple as it was had me hooked.  The over arcing mystery of the main female's existence interested me to no end and I believe the music and art compliments everything well.  Gameplay and most cutscenes are in a pixel style and it looks nice, but there are a few cinematic cutscenes that are in an anime style and they look nice.  Overall I would say that this game is great, but don't expect something on the scale of Final Fantasy, Fire Emblem, or just a licensed RPG title.

Not much in this game not to like, really. I almost feel bad for letting it sit in my library for a few months before finally actually playing it... I also almost feel bad that it was so short, as I really enjoyed it and played through the whole thing in a single sitting. So yeah, a great title.\n\nLiEat isn't a very long game, as it took me less than 4 hours to 100%. There isn't really any grinding involved like in many RPGs, so that should be a fairly accurate time it should take most people, I suppose. There was some extra exploring to do, but not all that much. The game is definitely story-centered, though the concept in the fights, where you fight and eat lies is a pretty fun and interesting idea.\n\nI'd suggest just buying the game and going in blind, as it's pretty short and it's nicer to find out everything throughout the story and dialogue rather than read about it.\n\nIf you need just a small taste of what's to come, the story is basically following a man and this very young dragon-girl as they go around from place to place (well, just one place per episode, and there are 3 of them, but still) and the man basically works as a detective, with the girl helping him out with her ability to see and literally eat lies.\n\nIf I have to say one negative thing, the... 'puzzles' in the last episode were a bit frustrating, as they had absolutely zero challenge to them, making them a bit frustrating — but they included dialogue and more story-telling as you progressed in them, so it wasn't too bad.","May 26","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each game is a relatively short and sweet rpg with a light fantasy-detective vibe.  The art is cute or disturbing as the narrative demands.  The writing is what really sells these games, though.  All of the characters are engaging and dynamic, the story of each game drags you in, answers your core questions while still leaving some backstory up to your imagination.  I don't have much background in music theory, but I found all of the songs nice to listen to and non-annoying, so there's that.  Those who enjoy stories about growing up, healing after traumatic experiences, and found families will most definitely enjoy these games.\n\nIf, however, you're super not into anime-esque graphics, or getting very little explanation for your story elements, then this is probably not the game series for you.  Also, the battles aren't particularly challenging, so if you're more into game mechanics than story this going to be another no-go for you.  Additionally, I didn't think that any of the answers to the mysteries were particularly tough to figure out way before the characters, but that might just be me.\n\nOverall, I heartily recommend the LiEat series for those who favor story over gameplay.","May 26","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is very short in terms of all three chapters but multipue endings give it some length but I stil haven't went and replay it for reasons I don't know. Maybe because it makes me feel dirty to ruin my exprience with this considering the fact that I got all the good endings in the game I don't want to get the bad endings even though they are non-canon.\n\nThis is a game I suggest playing in the background. It's something you play will you wait for a download to happen. I could suggest it for a proper game through once they add a fullscreen option and I would like to see more of this the future.
