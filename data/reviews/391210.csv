Its kind of arcade-like. You do not die right away when hit, and whatnot so its not too unforgiving. Seems like the kind of little gimmicky game you would see in a dive bar. I really like the daft-punk ish electronic music, and i did struggle a bit wielding my lightsaber thing using kb+m. Maybe a gamepad would fare better. Overall if you are into little arcade casual games you can mess with for a short time this one might be worth a pick on the cheap. Music is really great","September 27, 2015","true","3.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

It's come a long way since that version but the core element of the fun is still the same.\n\nGameplay is fast and a little crazy in a good way. It's a nice twist on the usual twin stick shooter outfit. I personally liked the boss battle levels the best. It's not a large game, but a lot of the fun comes from playing it with friends and just messing about. Also, if you're a high score junkie you'll love trying to scrape a few extra points in each level so there's some replay value.\n\nThe overall production qaulity is nice and the graphics are geometry wars style glowing prettyness. Music is good quality but is deliberately a feature and as such is in your face/ears. So it could be irritating for some people. On the other hand it's good to just listen to and appreciate.\n\nOnly other negative thing I could say about the experience was that my right thumb got sore swinging the sword around but I can't really blame the game for that. Overall though, definitely a fun way to spend half an hour now and then.\n\n","January 7","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Kinda like Asteroids with a sword and you gotta hit things into a certain area. Just move around and swing your mouse like crazy. So much satisfaction when you get the Grow powerup and hit everything with one swing :) If you're mad, great stress reliever. You can also change the speed\nProblems naming first player, too many extra letters to choose from.","March 4","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You smash your enemies into the right direction with the help of a laser sword.\nNot the kind of star wars lightsaber, but you get the idea ;-)\n\nThe graphic and effects are great for an indie game. The sound - elektro and chiptune - is sometimes too annoying. Some nice tracks, but some which are too annoying if you're not into the genre.\nThere is a singleplayer survival mode which can get challenging.\nYou can set the difficulty for the arcade mode and adjust the settings, so everything works fine.\n\nI got this game out of a bundle. The steam price of 6,99â‚¬ is a bit too high in my opinion.\nThe developers are active and looks like they are continousely improving their game.\n\nBut let's not forget that it's an arcade game. So if you don't like those games, you won't start loving it now.\nIf you like the idea of the game, feel free to get it :-)\n","October 21, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Really good as a local multiplayer game with 4 gamepads. Graphics and music are good too.","March 31","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
