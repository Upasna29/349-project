It says they "improve" but what does that mean? More health? More damage? It doesn't say, and I don't notice any difference in-game.\n","April 27","true","9.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Mouse controls are simple and fun to use. You have to plan your actions most of times, can't just run n' gun through the game. That'll get your squad finished off in no time. Levels are not at all repetitive, it feels like I'm going somewhere, not just grinding the same corners over and over again. There's some definite challenge especially in bossfights. It took me fair amount of time to figure out the first boss. Shrapnel and bodyparts flying everywhere.. it was hell I tell you!! Everything was going fine and dandy before that moment.. I lost many good men that day. Haven't finished the game yet but felt the need to give these guys my thanks and support. I'm really digging the soudtrack also!","April 20","true","8.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Settings are surprisingly comprehensive and there is even an option to select which monitor to use. Very nice if you have a TV attached to the computer and playing on a couch with controller.\nThe game is not so easy that you could just shoot at everything brainlessly, but you actually have to plan your moves at least until some point. It offers fast and easy fun, the first missions takes a couple of minutes but after that the missions gets tougher and last longer.\nImpressive first product from the team, highly recommended!","April 20","true","2.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Our people are forced into the mines where most of them will meet their worst nightmare - Death! The torment and devastation that the Prognati has brought to our beautiful PN MDCVIII planet and its citizens has taken its toll. Now I stand in front of you as the captain of our legion, and together we will conquer and expel the Prognati from our beautiful world!\n\nAction Legion is a top-down shooter game where you take control of one or several soldiers. Your objective is to eliminate the Prognati on each mission that you are given. Before entering an operation, you will be briefed on its objectives, and when you are ready to kick some Prognati butt, just start the mission!\n\nIn your first couple of assignments, you will only have one soldier at your disposition and he/she will be carrying an assault rifle. As you progress within the game, your missions will become slightly more challenging and you will be able to control a squad of soldiers. You will also be able to change the type of weapons your soldier(s) will be using as you unlock them.\n\nAs your start your mission, your soldier(s) will be teleported onto the map. You will control your soldier(s) with your mouse or with your mouse and keyboard. I personally prefer using the second option; I find it easier to control your soldier(s) movements. You will use your mouse to direct your soldierâ€™s shot. Be very careful with enemy snipers; some will be hidden under foliage and they can kill you with one shot! Apart from snipers, you will have assault soldiers, kamikazes and bosses to dispatch. In term of structures, there will be barracks to destroy as well as machine gun compounds and other types of bunkers. As you will not have access to grenades straight away, make sure to notice quickly where the explosive barrels are, as they will definitely come in handy for destroying structures. Be sure not to miss a crate, because some will hold Intel. When you achieve all assignments in your mission, just move towards the extractor point and you will be teleported back to mission HQ.\n\nGraphically the game looks good and the levels are well-designed, although some are too short, in my opinion. In regards to the controls, Action Legion is designed to be played with either a mouse and keyboard, or just the mouse.  I find that playing with the mouse only is less accurate for movements. Just use your keyboard to move your soldiers, and your mouse to indicate the direction in which your soldiers will shoot.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Fun and fast top-down shooter\n-	Well-designed levels + Hardcore mode\n-	Nice graphics\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Some levels are very short\n\nA fun and fast top-down shooter game! Come on ladies and gents, join Action Legion!\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

I think I'm about halfway through, and although it's simple, it has been fun and rewarding with each mission complete. If you use proper strategy, things will go smoothly. If your strategy is a bit messy, things can still go smoothly and it might be more exciting! There are definitely some "puzzle" elements sometimes.\n\nIt could use some AI for the enemies, so when they are under attack they don't just walk predictably into your line of fire. Other than that, it has been a fun experience and I intend on finishing! As you collect "intel" you get to see parts of the backstory and lore in graphic novel form, which is nice...I just am having trouble determining which order they go in!\n\nOverall, definitely worth purchasing and supporting this developer! I hope to see new mission packs in the future perhaps.","April 20","true","2.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The game only takes the mouse to control everything, So left mouse to move, and right to shoot and middle to throw grenades. It takes some practise to get used to this, or atleast it does for me, but once you get the feeling for it, you discover the tactics and fun of the game, very fun, and very well worth it. get it now if you enjoy a good commando action like game :) (remember old Commando?)\n\nHeres some gameplay\nhttps://youtu.be/SyPXLdNnWtI","April 19","true","1.9"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","12","24","0","2"

Burst meaning that levels are just perfect size for this kind of a intese shooter, its easy take on just one level if you are busy and have it there, but it got quite addicting soon for me at least and couldn't stop playing. Short levels kind of gave me this feeling achiving something big very fast...it felt good. There are also variety in levels, not all is run and destroy. There is snipers to avoid when you have to look for the best path to move without getting spotted. There is suprisingly wide variety of gameplay elements in this little big adventure.\nSpecial + i would give to awesome graphics(Effects, explosions and stuff feel realy authentic), Level design and of course for the awesome soundtrack. I have very poor audio system so cant say about that.\nRock ooon!!","April 21","true","1.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
