Unfortunately, they’re fairly predictable. The game is also not overly long for an RPG, with my playthrough clocking in at 14 hours. A good chunk of that 14 hours turned into unneeded grinding and some idling time while I did other things. So really, for your money you’re getting an around 10 hour adventure.\n\nLeveling in Arevan is a bit of a hit-or-miss thing. On one hand, a system exists so that you never actually have to FIGHT any bosses in the game. On the other hand, leveling up enough to be able to pull through these bosses offers some great rewards. And yes, you read that right – you don’t actually have to fight the bosses in this game. Should you die, you can choose to just continue on or try again. Choosing to continue on will automatically kill the boss, and in the cases of storyline ones, continue on in the story.\n\nArevan provides no in-game world map, and you’ll likely also end up hard pressed to try and find one online. And, of course, it ends up becoming very easy to get lost on said world map. Luckily, the game has a system of usable runes that let you quick travel to cities. While you have to actually find the NPCs that sell them, these prove to be a very handy to have around.\n\nArevan’s combat is a turn-based system. You’ll input everyone’s commands, and then based on the speed of you and the enemies, actions will happen in that order. If you know which character will go first (PS: It’s probably Pascal), you can manipulate to do certain actions at certain times. This can prove useful for landing those status effects as well. And luckily, you can scan every enemy in-battle by use of the shift key (or on controllers, at least on mine, the A button). It will be a bit confusing at first what each symbol means and what the colours mean, but you’ll eventually get the hang of it. If you see red though, use that and try and land the statuses that show as red. Just do it.\n\nThe biggest issue in Arevan is, by far, the sheer amount of spelling and grammar mistakes. From simple things such as words missing a letter to flat out spelling mistakes. I don’t know about you, but knowing I have a ]man and he’s being hemself heading intodungeons doesn’t leave that great of an impression. Sometimes the issues will be in every other line, sometimes they’ll just vanish completely for a bit. The game could use a good, thorough proof reading by a few people to try and clean up some of these mistakes.\n\nI also had issue with how the quest log was handled. Sometimes it was really clear on what I should do, other times not so much. Near the end, I got extremely lost on where to go until I finally stumbled upon something after over an hour of searching. In that time, I had done practically everything else I could do then. I’d done all the little side dungeons to make the last boss easier, I’d rescued a mermaid, and I’d helped some selfish treasure hunter find his secret dungeon. Of course, little did I know what doing all those side dungeons to make the last boss “easier” actually meant. I won’t spoil it, but needless to say I was left extremely unsatisfied at the end.\n\nSo, like most RPGMaker games, Arevan is not for everyone. You’ll need to deal with a gigantic amount of spelling issues and general getting lost. Luckily, I found the combat system and general story – minus the spelling/grammar issues – quite good. I also enjoyed the music and sound effects, even if some of them were things that were stock with RPGMaker instead of original. Overall, I would suggest the game, but only to folks who are fans of RPGMaker titles. If you’re looking for some big, fancy, 3D title, you’d best look elsewhere.","August 8, 2015","true","17.5"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","21","28","0","0"

And this game has that quality that begins with the young prince of Arevan (Maurean) being called on by his father to find out what exactly is going on with a series of murders in Arevan and surrounding kingdoms. And so Maurean sets out to recruit his party and explore the world to solve the mystery.\nAnd a great thing with this game is that each location gets better and more complex ---- the action intensifies, and this gives you that "one more scene, one more battle" feeling. Plus, there are a ton of side quests that will keep you very busy.\n\nSkills are learned not by leveling, but, instead, by consuming "skill pills" which can be bought, found, stolen, or by defeating foes throughout the world. And there are an abundance of these pills. It is up to the player to determine when and how and by who these skills should be used. Of course this adds to the fun of determining how to move forward in the game ---- there are multiple ways to strategize, which adds a lot to the replay value.\n\nI thought the art was fine, especially the unique monsters.\n\nAnd the music is a very big positive, with different tracks everywhere that I've never heard anything similar to before.\n\nSo don't let the first easy maze/dungeon fool you ---- it will get more challenging and involving as you move forward with lots of "a-ha" moments that add to the great fun of the game.\n\nI think it's a great addition to any library of these 16-bit style rpgs.\n","July 29, 2015","true","8.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","11","12","3","0"

It's a fairly decent JRPG, and that's really just about all i have to say.\nIt reminds me a lot of another JRPG, though the battle system is more like a different JRPG.\nThe humor is alright. The jokes are okay.\n\nOverall, it's just a Fairly Good JRPG. I can recommend it.

The story is simple with mysterious murders we’ll inquire. Then to learn that there’s something behind it.\nAt the start I’ve went to an area with too strong monsters, the game doesn’t tell you a precise area to go just here. But once you’re on the good place, it’s ok.\nA choice we make will kill a character or not but we can’t guess it during the scene.\nAt first I thought the enemy to be one of the characters we hear talking but even being mean, he’s not the culprit.\nYou have skill pills to apply to characters, a fairy for each place who’ll give you a reward if you killed all the monsters (or the boss) or let monsters for level up. Much later you could reach 2 places which have the best skill pills and gear.\nAverage graphism, 2 animals to travel. I've done it in 18 hours.\nI’m disappointed we learn the Bitter Truth once we’re done with all the rest for the final path.\nStill the Bitter Truth is surprising!\nA tip: save before the final choice.","September 13, 2015","true","1.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","2"

The map is enormous and lacks even road signs to tell you where cities are. This makes finding quest locations very frustrating. Then there's the over abundance of NPCs and non-interactive objects. In the beginning, you are encouraged to talk to NPCs to get quests. However, there are literally hundreds of NPCs that are only able to say one thing to you. Then there's the stuff. Everywhere. Objects galore. If there were some special feature that separated interactive objects from non-interactive, this wouldn't be so bad. Instead, important and non-important items are indistinguishable. Even though I haven't finished this game, I can't recommend it.","February 14","false","3.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
