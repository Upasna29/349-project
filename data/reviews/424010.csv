After playing for 100 minutes, I reached just one of the endings and unlocked 4 out of 28 achievements, so the game has plenty of replayability and many different endings.\n\nThe game is set in a beautiful steampunk world and has a very intriguing story.\n\nA strange issue is that most of the character models are a lot taller than the main character, so for some reason the character looks like a child compared to everyone else in the world.\n\nFor the most part, the journal system works (discover something, check your journal for what to do next, etc.) But every once in a while the journal just doesn't update, meaning you have to wander around until you find the right place or talk to the right person.\n\nThere are a few issues with this game; however, its charm and its very low price outweigh these issues in my opinion and make this game certainly worth it.","January 21","true","4.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

We follow Henry, a scientist on the brink of bringing his fantastical invention to completion, tragically interrupted by some uninvited guests. In the backdrop of steam engines, urban unrest, and a looming plague, Henry is dragged into piecing together an unravelling mystery.\n\nA single Crudelis playthrough takes up to 60 minutes, but the game provides the opportunity for replays thanks to numerous possible plot outcomes. It takes place in just one small city, the Abarian Creek, where you can explore houses, shops and workplaces as you make your way through this piece of detective fiction. The minimalistic soundtrack and the visuals help to build the atmosphere, but it’s the little period details that bring this world to life – books scattered throughout the map (think Dickens, Marx, Dostoyevsky, Stoker, etc.), period firearms and dated technology, an ongoing workers’ strike at the local factory. It might not seem much, but these details make exploring the city for the first time quite a pleasant experience. It doesn’t take long to uncover most of the map however, which is a shame, but at least afterwards you can focus on figuring out the different story paths, of which there are quite a few.\n\nOn the technical side, the game performs well. I had two or three freezes but a quick restart solved the issue and a good use of the auto-save system meant I did not lose any progress. Steam overlay is unfortunately not an available function. The English translation would benefit from some editing (some bits sound awkward, etc.), but it’s certainly playable. The best option is to play in Polish, the original language, if you can understand it of course.\n\nThere are a couple of other issues with Crudelis. It borrows mechanics from adventure games, but it also reproduces some of the annoyances of the genre, so expect to do some pixel hunting. Furthermore, the journal is at times somewhat obtuse which means you may get stuck once or twice. Crudelis also suffers from the limitations of the RPG Maker, and if you’ve played other games on the engine you already know what to expect gameplay wise. There’s little in the way of surprise in that regard. The way the story is told is a highlight feature, but some paths feel a bit disjointed if taken on their own. I also wish the endings were presented more clearly – there is one main ending, but you can easily miss it (and at least once I came across a glitch which made it impossible to finish). The other outcomes are mostly premature game overs which don’t provide as much closure.\n\nOverall though, Crudelis is a pleasant and atmospheric game, and if you find the story or the setting compelling enough you will not regret the few hours you spend with it. Since this seems to be their first project of this scale, it will be interesting to see what the developers behind Crudelis come up with next.","January 30","true","7.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jxraiv/recommended/424010/","jxraiv","JXRaiv","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jxraiv/","451 products in account","Crudelis\nI first heard about Crudelis in September 2014 when it appeared on Steam Greenlight. Created by two Poles, the game promised up to 60 minutes of gameplay for a single playthrough in a cruel steampunk world with an intricate mystery to solve. Right away it got my attention thanks to the outline of the plot and shortly before the release I got access to a version for testers. Although I'm not a big fan of games created in RPG Maker, due to the limitations of the engine imposed on artists (because of which a lot of really cool ideas and solutions may have to be very simplified), but the announced Crudelis was supposed to be different from most games based on this engine - and almost a month after the release I can confirm that it is.\n\nThe most important aspect which distinguishes this game from many other titles released over the years, whether free of charge or not, is that here we do not save the world from some "GREAT EVIL". There are no large castles, abandoned dungeons and scary monsters, and no random fights with enemies that pop-up from behind a bush (such as huge monsters) that serve as filler content. There is also no need to grind by killing evil goblins and other monstrosities in order to earn a sword with slightly better stats that would help us to fight a troll boss or some other beast. All of this has its charm but after playing a few such games the player usually experiences more exhaustion than enjoyment. Some of these games are underdeveloped, others abandoned in the middle of production, or use only the basic graphics. Of course not all games created in RPG Maker are like this (see for example "Pom Gets Wi-Fi" - I highly recommend that game!) but looking at any message board devoted to this engine, we quickly notice that the vast majority want to be "another Gothic or Skyrim" with some epic quest and a great treasure and/or princess at the end. The guys from Whiskey Jack Games felt tired of constantly saving the world and decided to break out of this pattern in their first title. Therefore, within the first five minutes of the game, shortly before a breakthrough test of a machine aimed at reviving the dead, we are attacked in our home and almost mortally wounded, and only thanks to that machine we get the opportunity to solve the mystery of who was behind the attack. It will not be an easy task because we only have 60 minutes to live, and what awaits us is lots of investigating, figuring out the facts from misleading clues.\n\nMisleading clues are the other aspect which distinguishes this title from many others. Most games made in RPG Maker are very linear, because making a story that branches out is a tiring and annoying process for the developers. The developers of Crudelis waded through this quite nicely and managed to branch out the story in a few places so that we have as many as 12 coherent and meaningful endings that are more than just different background colours. Thanks to this, we have to play the game at least a couple of times in order to discover all of them, and during these playthroughs it will be up to us to decide who to trust and who is an ally. Some of the endings and achievements are very hard to get because few things are served to us on a plate. We have to figure out the facts, search rooms and be careful of what we say and who we trust.\n\nMoving away from the story - in Crudelis we have beautiful, colourful graphics, and the interiors of each building are completely different. To this we are treated with nice music and sound effects which build up the atmosphere of a living steampunk world. On the shelves you will find books with short, more or less humorous, descriptions and characters that sometimes speak lines from popular movies, suitably adapted. Thanks to all these treats, revealing the secrets of the Abarian Creek is much more pleasant.\n\nWhen I think about the cons of Crudelis, only two or three things come to mind:Many English-speaking people complain about the English translation, that there are some grammatical errors and typos. As far as I know the translator is already burning in hell because of that.\nThe player can get stuck during the game, because for example they skipped a significant dialogue. Crudelis is a game that requires attention. Although for me it was no problem as I read everything carefully, I heard a comment that someone did not know what to do because they simply did not pay attention, and a log entry was not enough. As I wrote earlier - you cannot rely just on the journal and sometimes you have to show a bit of creativity because crime puzzles do not solve themselves.\nThe game can sometimes feel as if something is missing or something was cut. It just cries for expanding certain topics. But I know from conversations with the developers that they did not manage to fit in certain things in time, but they will be released in the near or distant future as free DLC, extending the game - which makes me very happy.\nSo, should you try Crudelis? Personally I think that if you, dear gamer, enjoy steampunk vibes or just want to support the two-man studio Whiskey Jack Games so that perhaps in a few years you get to play a bigger project of theirs, then you certainly should.","February 15","true","17.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"
