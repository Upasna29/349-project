Tough guy can punch through walls and knock some guards out indefinetly if standing over them. Others can knock out guards via choroform and break walls via a acid if you picked one up or supplied one at the start when planning the missiong. Rocket can jump through security laser beams (others can disable via a usable tool if they have one) and go through vents in the wall. The other woman is fast and can go through floor grates to hide and the robot after upgraded won't be seen by cameras or guards cone fields of vision, can go over electrified floor panels and laser beams, but only interact with some basic things, can't use all tools.  The lock pick guy is helpful, but you can find keys along the way or use a blow torch or bomb if you didn't select him as part of your team at the beginning.  So LOTS of creativity in doing missions.\n\n\n- Some features like vents can't be used until unlocking a certain character, so can't utilize some aspects in the first 8 levels (maybe its for replaying the game after beating it?). Wish you could select the skills to upgrade or unlock sort of like deus ex - human revolution style enabling you can pick your path rather than forced down a particular way. Also, some parts are fairly linear so is more of a puzzle with few paths or options.\n\n\nNOTEWORTHY:\n\nIts a bit slow paced (methodical planning), so if you lack patience this might not be of interest. In the later levels it takes lots of planning and precision.\n\nIts addicting once you get a hang of it, fairly laid back but fun, unique and thought provoking!\n\nThe attention to detail is noticable and it is reasonably priced.\n\nIf you like the game, "The Master Plan" this should be up your alley!  Some small similarities to Doorkickers, Monaco and Marvelous Mistake too.\n\nHope you found this helpful, if unsure still check out the FREE DEMO-which has been out before the game was released and has four maps, so is enough gameplay for you to get into it or not. Also, Steam has a refund policy if under 2hrs or you can wait for a sale if in doubt.\n\n\n9.5/10 based on price, creativity, stealth, fun and unique.\n\nkc\nMeatvideo.com - Factory Farm Animal Cruelty, Why Vegan?","August 25, 2015","true","51.0"," 120 of 152 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","120","152","4","9"

See Conclusion\nThe key was given to me for the purpose of review\nINTRODUCTION:Crookz – The Big Heist is a semi-real time tactical strategy game developed by Skilltree Studios and published by Kalypso Media Digital who's known for titles such as Tropico 5 and Dungeons II. The game is available on the PC, Mac and Linux with a free Demo available to anyone who wishes to try the game first. It features tactical strategy with an emphasis on stealth, perfect planning, execution and adapting to different situations.\n\nPLOT (No Spoilers):The story revolves around a group of highly skilled professional jewel thieves in the 1970s (Disco Age) striving to bring their group back together while, at the same time, planning an elaborate plot to get revenge against a former team mate who, some years ago, betrayed the group when he left his team get arrested while running off with a piece of Tiberium “Moon Rock” which they were supposed to steal together.\n\nPROS:+ The game captures the 1970s vibe perfectly\n+ Great art style, visuals and overall presentation with attention to detail\n+ Good sound effects and retro-style background music\n+ Excellent waypoint based game mechanic\n+ Excellent level progression and difficulty curve:\n(The game teaches you the mechanics step by step until you've gotten the hang of it.)\n+ Thief variety with each one having their own unique specialization\n+ Well designed and fun to play missions\n+ Good replayability:\n(The story missions can be solved several ways and additionally, the game includes a Challenge Mode where you can test your planning skills to the limit)\n+ Good game time\n+ Challenging late game missions\n\nCONS:- Very limited thief customization\n- No speed up time button:\n(although there is a pause button)\n- No Ironman mode:\n(i.e. One auto save file only that is constantly over written and no manual or quick saving – this would have given the game more challenge)\n- Slight animation glitches that can ruin your plan:\n(Not very common but it does happen. i.e.: A thief walks past a 'waypoint marker' where a slight glitch may occur where the thief turns around for a split second before continuing on the correct path, this can be annoying in situations where every second would count.)\n\nNEUTRAL:+/- The theme may not appeal to most people\n+/- Slow paced gameplay: (because of all the planning involved)\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME for players who likes planning, micromanagement and tactical strategy.\n\nWORTH IT?The game comes with a reasonable price tag of $30 at its full price (or your regional equivalent) which is well worth it for tactical strategy lovers and, to  lesser extent, strategy gamers as a whole. The game does offer a Demo version for you to try out so be sure to check that out in the store page before deciding to purchase the product.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike our Reviews?

If you won't settle for anything less than absolute best, than it will play like a puzzle. Otherwise, you can approach it like a strategy game.\n\nI should mention that I really enjoy this subgenre of strategy games, and I really enjoy games with a Look & Feel that reminds me of Evil Genius, Ghost Master, among a few others; so it was unlikely that I wouldn't enjoy this one.\n\nStill, I'm finding this game easy to recomend even for those that might not be as into this genre as I am.

Gameplay is challenging but never impossible, and there are almost always multiple ways to achieve your goals within the missions.\n\nThe 70s vibe is pretty good (aside from some glaring anachronisms, if you're old enough to notice them), the soundtrack is solid, and the graphics, while nothing stellar, are clean and crisp. The writing is definitely on the weak side, and unfortunately much of the voice acting is pretty horrible.

You can see a detailed map of the building, complete with guard patrol routes and vision cones, plus the locations of security cameras, laser sensor alarms and locked doors.\n\nMost heists allow you to bring four out of the six available crew members, each of whom have their own unique skills. There's a specialist lockpicker, a thug who can temporarily knock out guards (you can't kill anybody) and punch through weak walls, a technician who can disable electronic security devices, a contortionist who can squeeze through air vents, a runner who can move much faster than everyone else, and one other who I won't mention because of story spoilers.\n\nYou can also find items during a heist, or buy them during the planning stage, that can allow non-specialists to perform certain actions. For example crowbars will let anyone open a locked door, and anyone can KO guards by using chloroform. Other items that I found really useful include noise makers which can draw guards out of position, and door blockers (basically some kind of industrial strength super glue) that can trap guards in a room so they don't interrupt you later.\n\nMap layouts are really intelligently designed to allow multiple solutions, by bringing different team members and using different items. Once you start the heist, the action is in real time, but you can pause to issue commands. You can save at any time and there are frequent auto saves, so if you make any mistakes they're easy to undo.\n\nCrookz' biggest weakness - and I seem to be saying this about alot of games lately - is that the AI is dumb as a brick. If a guard sees one of your people they will chase after them, and if they catch them its an instant mission failure. However, if you can break line of sight, the guard will go to the last place they saw you, look around for a few seconds, say something like "must have been my imagination", and just go back to their normal patrol route. They won't keep searching or alert the other guards.\n\nAnd as long as the guards don't actually see your people, they won't react to alot of suspicious situations. They don't care about most doors opening and closing before their eyes, or laser grids shutting off unexpectedly. There was one heist where a guard heard me use dynamite to blow up a weak wall, they came running over to investigate, but I had just enough time to get out of sight. He examined the massive hole in the wall for a few seconds, shrugged his shoulders and went back to his normal route. On another heist I KO'd one awkwardly placed guard half a dozen times as I travelled back and forth across the level, and he never called for backup, or raised the alarm. I can also remember one time I trapped a guard in a room, he was banging on the door calling for help, another guard walked past the door and just ignored it. I actually started to feel bad for exploiting their stupidity.\n\nHeists are linked together by a fairly decent story, although they tried to make too many jokes with the dialogue that I didn't really find very funny. It took me 24 hours to complete the game and there are some additional challenge modes that I haven't tried yet. Controls work fine with mouse and keyboard and the only bug that I can remember was when I tried to order my lockpick guy to use a door blocker on a locked door, the only option I was given was to pick the lock, which I didn't want to do. I had to give the door blocker to another team member and have them use it.\n\nOverall Crookz is a fun game which rewards tactical planning, and I think its worth playing, although hardcore stealth fans might find it a bit too casual.","January 27","true","24.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Did you like those games?  If you answered yes to both those questions then this game is for you.\n\nFull review: Crookz is an isometric, real time with pause, tactical stealth game set in the 70s that follows the exploits of a group of professional thieves.\n\nPros:\n\n* 70s setting\n* 70s style funk soundtrack\n* Strong tactical gameplay\n* Missions play out differently depending on your chosen team members and tools you brought with you\n* Great difficulty curve\n* Elegant and user friendly UI\n* Game autosaves every 30 or so seconds\n\nCons:\n\n* Less than stellar visuals\n* Mediocre writing\n* Enemy AI is a bit too easy to exploit\n* Rare pathing issues\n\nCrookz plays a bit like the old Commandos and Desperados games, except even less combat focused.  The idea is to break into a facility, steal or plant something, take any other goodies you can along the way, and get out without being caught.  To achieve this you have a team of thieves, each with their own unique skills.  Most of the time you can't bring the whole team along, so you much choose carefully who to bring for the job.  There are tools available which can make up for skills you lack, covering areas that other teammembers that got left behind would have taken care of, but these tools are consumable (1 use) and you have very limited inventory space.\n\nOne of the best things about this game is how good the UI is.  You can pause the game at any time and give out a set of instructions to your team members, including multiple waypoints and multiple commands at each waypoint.  Furthermore you can delete any individual command at any waypoint or any individual waypoint and the game will connect the remaining waypoints for you, making adjusting plans on the fly rather user friendly.\n\nThe game starts out very easy with rather straightforward missions and easy to bypass security.  Missing skills can be easily accounted for with tools found in the levels themselves or by taking a different approach.  The game difficulty definitely ramps up though and the missions get more and more complicated and it become almost impossible to cover all bases with team member skills and tools, so you have to improvise in some areas to get past obstacles.  The missions have some replayability to as you can go back to them later when you have access to other team mebers and skills at your disposal (each character has multiple skills that unlock as the story progresses) and try to beat your previous best score.\n\nThere is also a challenge mode with particularly difficult missions that you need to attempt with specific team members and tools on hand.  These can be real tricky.\n\nFor the most part, pathing is pretty good, though once in a long while weird issues arise, like a character trying to take the long way around through a hole in the wall when there's an open door right in front of them.  These can be worked around by doing smaller steps with your waypoints and happen quite rarely.  Also, the enemy AI seems a little too easy to exploit and to get away from when they spot you.  You need to be able to exploit the enemy AI to some degree to get past some obstacles, but it seems a bit too easy to trick them or lose them when they pursue you.\n\nOverall, this is a game I very much enjoy playing.  The gameplay is really solid and the game can get quite challenging with a lot of moving parts to try to keep track of and complicated security systems to try to bypass.  If you're looking for a tactical stealth game then you owe it to yourself to try this game out.","September 6, 2015","true","38.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

The characters can form a maximum team size of 4 which you can decide on in the planning phase to decide your favoured approach as there are many methods to complete the jobs. It is possible to complete the heists with any team combo with the use of tools found on the mission map itself and the choice of three tools for each character you can decide on and carry from the planning phase.\nYour job is to steal something or setup conditions to make the next heist possible. There is a "heat meter" for gauging how many times the guards and cameras have spotted you which should you max out will end the mission, the heat meter can be lowered by using a tool on a camera security box if the meter gets too high.\nGuards are either stationary or on a route which you can observe through the use of a hotkey, you can either sneak past them by avoiding their cone of vision, distract them away from their route or knock the guard out with your thug or other character who has the chloroform tool if possible. Some guards can not be knocked out.\nThere are plenty of tools and tactics which allow for a creative solution to each heist and I am giving this game a thumb up as I am enjoying the experience.\n","August 28, 2015","true","51.8"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

This changes the feel of the game somewhat: Instead of a scrappy sneaky thief making things up as you go along, you are a master criminal crafting and then executing a devious master plan. Or something like that anyway.\n\nYou have several characters with mutually exclusive skills only some of which can come with you. In practice however, you almost certainly need the only character who can pick locks, the only character who can cut cameras, and the only character who can take out [most] guards. Item choices can partially mitigate this, but once you have found a team that fits your style, the other characters aren't really involved much.\n\nThe other big drawback to the game is that the skill development is not terribly exciting. For example, one character can sneak through light barriers. Except later on the higher security complex have laser barriers instead. Except that later on, your character gets a new skill allowing her to sneak through laser barriers as well. Yawn.\n\nThere are some challenge levels that are much harder -- and force you to use a particular set of team members and equipment. However, I did not have enough interest to want to continue once I completed the main campaign.\n\nOverall, a decent game. But not an exceptional one. I bought it on sale, and suggest you do too.","May 2","true","52.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Each character has its own role, as in things that they specialize in doing, which the other characters cannot do without tools that are either found or bought in the pre-planning stage of the current map. What makes this game great though, is that you really have to plan ahead the moves of each character, several steps ahead, which also has to time each action with what task you put the other characters to do at the same time. Whether that may be timing a knocked out guard with picking a lock or flipping a switch, or all of it at the same time.\nWhat adds to the overall "good feeling" of the game, is first of all the characters which are all very stereotyped in a good way. But also the Tarantino'esque music (feels taken directly out of Jackie Brown, or some scores of Ocean's Eleven, latter not being Tarantino's work though) and the surroundings, everything gets a little funkier with dimmed and or colored lighting, right?","September 3, 2015","true","1.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","6","11","2","0"

Each character has a set of specific skills for example Cleopatra runs faster than all other and can also run through laser beams whereas Bishop as the locksmith is the only one who can pick locks without tools. The characters are all useful in certain levels and selecting your crew comes down to your own play style as well as the various puzzles that will be faced.\n\nSomething which I personally enjoyed was the planning phase for a level which works similar to the old rainbow six games in which you can carefully view the blueprints of the level to see what you’ll be up against. In this phase you can scout the level, select your crew and then equip them. There is a variety of equipment available to outfit your thieves with, each costs money from the pool of cash you earn from each successful heist. Each character can only carry three items at any one time which forces you to plan ahead but equipment can also be found in the level. Items range from crowbars to unlock doors and strongboxes, to chloroform for taking out guards. As the game progresses you’ll gain access to more characters and equipment to play around with which then you can take to the challenge mode to replay older missions with new characters.\n\nOnce done with planning, the level will start in paused mode in which you can path out your first moves. While the pathing sounds like it makes the game easy, you will often have to pause to make quick changes due to changing guard patterns. One of the key difficulty mechanics is timing, timing your movements, flicking of switches and lock picking of doors is crucial which makes the levels tenser. With patrolling guards, cameras, lasers, switch doors and more, timing and the team work of your crew is essential for not getting caught. Each level has two failure states, first is the heat bar which increases each time you are seen by a guard or device. The second is being arrested by a guard which results in an instant game over.\n\nThe levels are fairly enjoyable and there is a decent progression of difficulty in the puzzles. The pathing suffers some problems occasionally with mis-clicks and it can become a little finicky when setting up various actions. The art style of the game works well, its 70’s style is reinforced with the use of vibrant colors. There’s some nice art assets in the game however I personally disliked the use of large icons for items in levels. While the game certainly is not graphically impressive it does a decent job of looking attractive, some animations like walking through doors are odd and could have been much better.\n\nThe games soundtrack has a good mix of 70’s style music that’s fun to listen too. Like I’ve said the voice acting isn’t too bad the major issues with both audio and graphically is that there is a host of bugs, while I have not encountered anything game breaking, the audio has bugged out on almost every level with frequent pops or turning on and off. There are frequent graphically problems with clipping, lighting issues, paths being showing even after you’ve deleted them and more. It’s pretty buggy but theres little in the way of game hampering stuff.\n\nOverall Crookz is a decent stealth tactical heist game, I feel it’s over simplistic in places and could have done with being a lot more difficult especially when there is only 18 levels. I personally would have liked larger levels with more emergent gameplay and fewer of the more linear levels however the range the game offers is not bad. While the challenge mode offers the game a little life line in terms of longevity I think a map editor for players to create and play each other’s maps would have been a really beneficial mode for this game. There’s around 10+ hours of game to play if you’re terrible at the game like me however I imagine you could get the single player campaign completed in just less than 10. The game is of a good quality and at $30 the game will satisfy fans of tactical stealth games however if you’re unsure at what you’ve seen I would certainly wait for a sale.","August 25, 2015","true","9.0"," 56 of 111 people (50%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","50","56","111","8","5"

I'm not sure exactly what to compare it to, it is fairly unique. Runs well on win 10, graphics are fantastic and just right from an interface perspective. Controls are extremely simple; right mouse sets a waypoint/performs an action on an item, left mouse allows swapping characters, scroll wheel zoom, middle mouse runs the camara angle. space bar pauses. There are a few hotkeys you can map and the best thing of all, even though it is real time, you can give/change orders while paused. Funky 70s background music, excellent voice acting, a storyline that would make an excellent movie,  and a feature I love, the ability to skip cutscenes, or to replay them if you want to see if you missed any clues.\n\nThis game probably has 50-100 hours of play, and you can redo heists to get a higher score/faster time so there is some replayability.\n\nThis is not a shooter, its not multiplayer, its not really RPG (although you choose your specialists and their loadoat for each mission) so if that is what you want then look elsewhere. Otherwise get it. You won't be sorry.\n","May 22","true","19.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Alas, as an alien much greater than me once said "It's a Trap!".\n\nHaving disbanded after the last heist and down to two members of the original gang you set off to steal this rare moonstone again, years later. Only this time, it's personal.\n\nCrookz The Big Heist is at it's core a simulation heist game. You start with two thieves each with their own "Particular set of skills". With more of the old gang coming back as you progress through the 18 heist scenarios.\n\nThe game starts off with a great introduction to the story by making this first "trap" heist act as the tutorial. Explaining the basics of how to unlock doors, read guards, and collect precious loots.\n\nEach level is a little more story and the actual heist itself. You start with an overview of the level where you can select what crew you're bringing with you and purchase any tool you think you may need or want to have just in case.\n\nDelivered in a sweeping look of the map, the narrator explains what you are doing there, what your target is, and things to look out for. During this phase you can zoom in and out, watch guards pathing, and you can see what switches open which doors, etc... You can then start setting commands for your crew. You set waypoints for each member of the crew, which can be edited on the fly.\n\nYou progress through each stage by setting these waypoints, having crew members unlock doors, knock out guards, and clear out without anyone getting caught. Precision is key here. Knowing when to set members to wait and taking advantage of the pause button will go along way in a successful heist.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2sWLlCqZFgk\n\nOverall, Crookz is a well designed top-down heist game with a great single player campaign, challenge mode, and enough 70's music to keep you shakin' your groove thing for hours.\n\nFor More Reviews and the Bi-Weekly Podcast\nEarly Access Media[www.earlyaccessmedia.com]\nYouTube\nPodcast[www.earlyaccesspodcast.com]","August 26, 2015","true","1.4"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","14","31","0","3"
