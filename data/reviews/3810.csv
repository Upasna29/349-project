It has many flaws, but above all these, it has a swift and amusing gameplay, great heroine constantly throwing out black humor quotes and the "cutting system" (you can literally cut any imaginable little piece of body, like a quarter of face or piece of fingers. Or you can slice and dice the bad guys like a bread into a thousand of segments - what a highly sophisticated technology for such an old game! :-D ) of enemies can be really strangely satisfying.\n\nSadly, as this is an old game, it has issues when you try to run it on newer versions of Windows, such as low resolution, crashes and also sound clipping during cutscenes. I did my research and manage to find an ultimate solution for every problem:\n\nTo solve crashes, go to your Steam directory Steam/steamapps/common/BloodRayne and in the folder, right click on rayne.exe and set it's compatibility mode to Windows 98/ME. Also, be sure to check you have disabled the DPI scaling (it is in the same tab as the compatibility setting). This solved all the crashes for me and I haven't got a single crash in 4 hour playthrough.\n\nFor low resolution solution, launch the Bloodrayne first and after entering the menu, starting a new game, go through the first cutscenes and then quit the game. After that, go to your Steam directory Steam/steamapps/common/BloodRayne/system and in the folder, open rayne.ini - In the .ini file, search for these two gamePIXY= gamePIXX= and after the "=", type your desired resolution (for example gamePIXY=1440 gamePIXX=2560). I run the game in 2560x1440 without any problem.\n\nAnd finally, to solve the sound clipping issue, install MSI Afterburner. The clipping is caused by the fact that the game is designed to run on 30 FPS max and newer computers run it on higher FPS - that is causing the problem. So you have to lock/cap your FPS to 30. To do that, install MSI Afterburner and load it. Wait until a RivaTuner icon shows in your system tray and after that, right click on it, select Show and set your FPS limit in the interface to 30 FPS. Remember to always turn Afterburner on if you want to play BloodRayne.\n\nHope this will help to enjoy this great classic! Cheers!","June 23, 2015","true","8.3"," 171 of 174 people (98%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","98","171","174","5","3"

Yeah, it's a classic for me, so i love it. The whole game is really funny and has a very sexy and cool main character. The Combat-System: here blood, there blood, everywhere blood blood?! Of course, Bloodrayne isn't soft. You can choose between your bladed weapons or a large number of different firearms. Who needs a medic when you can drink blood to recover, a harpoon can help you to catch your victim. Special skills help in the fight against different types of opponents. In the first part of the Bloodrayne-saga, you only run from level to level and fight against lots of enemies. The degree of difficulty grows with each level. The level-design seems confuse at first, but later it makes sense. The checkpoint-system is sometimes really annoying. If you die in one of the levels, you have to repeat the whole level again, because there aren't special-checkpoints. Last Point - Graphics: What do you expect? The game is old and this isn't a remake!\n\nTo bring it to the point: It is a cool oldschool Hack & Slay, no more, no less. 7,5/10\n\nIn summary:\nPro        Contra                + sexy main character        - annoying checkpoint-system                + funny        - some dialogues are cut off                + bloody\n\nPS: I just wanted to write a short review, which brings the essence of the game to the point.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nixxi/recommended/3810/","Nixxi","Nix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nixxi/","4983 products in account","Bloodrayne is a third-person, action, hack and slash game that originally came out on October 15, 2002. It's been 11 years since i last played it on the original XBOX. Exploring the levels and meeting all the antagonist and monsters again is really nostalgic. Rayne is the main protagonist in the game. She is a dhampir who is in search of her father; Kaegan. She is later recruited into the Brimstone Society and that is where the game begins.\n\nStory:\nThe story in Bloodrayne is not complex at all. You and your mentor Mynce from the Brimstone Society are sent to Mortton, Lousiana to investigate a disease that is turning humans into mutates. The unique enemy in this act are called Maraisreqs. Not much happens in this act apart from your first boss fight the Queen of the Underworld and your first meet with Jurgen Wulf (The main antagonist) who is the founder of the G.G.G and is trying to become immortal by acquiring powerful relics scattered across the world. The next act takes place 5 years later in Argentina, Rayne is assigned to eliminate several high ranking G.G.G.(Gegengeist Gruppe) officers before they can get ahold of one of the powerful relics. These officers serve as the mini-boss and bosses of the game. Midway through the act a new enemy type is introduced called Daemites. Act III takes place in Germany. Rayne is assinged a new list of G.G.G targets to eliminate. This act also introduces another enemy type called Feral Vampires. I can't put the rest of this act in words without spoiling major parts of the story.\n\nGameplay:\nThe combat system is plain and repetitive but enjoyable; Rayne's primary weapons are her blades which can do up to a 5 meele combo as long as she makes contact with an enemy. Her secondary weapons are guns. There are about 33 different weapons including Pistols, Rifles, Shotguns, SMGs, Assault Rifles, Dynamite and Grenade Launchers) in the game. She has 8 slots for weapons, 3 for light weapons, 3 for heavy weapons, 1 for grenades and 1 for special weapons. Rayne has 3 unique abilities that she can use, one from the start of the game and two you unlock in Argentina. Aura Sense: Targets and destinations will shine bright blue, Dilated Perception: Slow motion, and Extruded View: Allows you to zoom. The game will take you anywhere from 6-8 hours to complete.\n\nPros:\n+ Basic but enjoyable combat.\n+ Decent amount of variety.\n+ Great level progression.\n+ Immersing experience.\n+ Rayne's dialogue.\n\nCons:\n- Checkpoint system can be an annoyance at times.\n- Graphics are outdated.\n- The last few words of all dialogue in cutscenes cuts out. (Fixed by turning V-Sync ON = 30 FPS)\n\nNotes:\n"Another man falling to pieces over me." ‚Äï Rayne","August 29, 2014","true","9.6"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/3810/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The action adventure market is crowded with titles these days, with developers and publishers trying to create the next Mrs. Croft, but as many publishers are finding out, making a decent action adventure game is no small task. Majesco was obviously feeling confident when they enlisted Terminal Reality to create BloodRayne, though. The folks at Terminal Reality are no strangers to the genre, with one pretty damn scary action adventure called Nocturne under their belts.Their  project known as BloodRayne is a fast-paced action oriented blood-fest. The game is brimming with violence and animated boobs - yes, animated bouncing boobs. It's got plenty of eye-candy and some really good action. So is it good enough to warrant your attention?\n\nAs the half-vampire BloodRayne, you have sworn your life to protect humanity from the supernatural. (Bad monsters, as opposed to good monsters like you) Your latest assignment: Seek and destroy the nefarious vampire Jurgen Wolf before he can use powerful occult relics to unleash untold horror upon the world. Jurgen is a Nazi of course, and our heroine BloodRayne is employed by the secretive anti-Nazi society (Brimstone) to thwart his evil plans.\n\nBloodRayne is a product of her human mother's ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• by her vampire father. Born with powers of a vampire without all the weaknesses, and just like Blade, BloodRayne is on the edge and very hard to contain. She puts the hurt on Nazis like you wouldn't believe - chopping off limbs, snapping spines and sucking their blood to feed. Her only weakness is water. BloodRayne doesn't like water - in fact, if she stays in it for too long, she dies. By making her vulnerable to water, the designers have in fact found a clever way to limit BloodRayne's movement, and make the game appear less linear than it really is.\n\nBut even with this clever trick the designers couldn't really disguise the game's obvious linearity. Gameplay wise this is not a downside as BloodRayne doesn't really try to be anything but a straight-up linear action game. There is a lot of fighting, shooting and gallons of blood being splattered across the walls. Luckily, the action is as smooth and interesting as in any action adventure out there. In fact, it is even comparable to the feel of Max Payne. There are just so many things that Terminal Reality's new Infernal Engine can do.\n\nVisually, it does a wonderful job of creating different types of environments. Scary settings, outdoor areas, cool looking Victorian style houses - there are just loads of tricks that this piece of code can pull off. The bump mapping effects on the models look awesome, the camera work is fluid and it doesn't take away from the action. The models look detailed and very well animated, and the real-time shadow effects are eye-catching but not too intrusive. In a word, the engine boasts some very solid visuals for an action adventure game. The water surfaces look beautiful and the reflection of the moon in the water adds a special flair to the outdoor areas. Because of the excellent animation, bump-mapping and the engine's proprietary bullet-time effect the action looks smooth and very appealing.\n\nAs far as the controls are concerned it all works very fluently and intuitively. BloodRayne can use both of her hands to fight. You'll be controlling the left hand with one mouse button and the other one with your right mouse button. What this does is give more freedom during fights to choose between melee type of attacks, and ranged weaponry, which includes all manners of fire arms like bazookas and chainguns. I should also mention that the physics engine works very well and that almost every object in the game is destructible.\n\nThe levels themselves are decently designed. As I said, the game is linear but the designers have provided a nice enough combination of indoor and outdoor environments and some very interesting boss creatures to keep the player interested at all times. The level design and puzzles are not nearly as versatile as in say, Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, but they're tough enough to provide a decent challenge for the player. The same goes for the AI routines. Nazis are fairly smart and I couldn't notice any serious flaws in their behavior while playing the game. The AI code never took my attention away from the action, which is good enough for me.\n\nThe only thing that this game truly lacks is a half-decent story and professional voice acting. Action adventure games are as much about the story and character development, as they are about cool action and dazzling 3D effects. Unfortunately, BloodRayne is completely lacking in this department. The story is mundane, uninspiring, and above all, is not conveyed well. It never really grabs your attention as the game never bothers to truly explain any of the character's motives, much less explaining the story's chapter jumps.\n\nThe plot has done virtually nothing to further my interest in this game. Tolkien once said that people are usually attracted to the history behind a story, and the realization that there is a huge wealth of information and proceedings that led up to the events in it. BloodRayne has virtually none of this. You don't feel a part of the game world, and you don't know why you are there. The history behind it all isn't properly explained and the narrators have failed to create a living and breathing fantasy world.\n\nIn summary, great action, smooth controls and a very good 3D engine can only do so much for a game. Ultimately, you have to have a decent story in there and some good voice acting to make the entire thing believable and immersing. Without these crucial components an action adventure game can never truly become great. BloodRayne is a decent action-adventure that should provide players with some fun moments, albeit without any background or meaning to it. I had fun with it, but not as much fun as I could've had if the story and voice acting were even half-decent.","November 29, 2015","true","8.9"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisbuttman/recommended/3810/","thisisbuttman","Buttman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisbuttman/","480 products in account","Now, now, where to begin with?\n\nTo put it simply, this game is like a big budget cult B-movie, if that makes any sense!\n\nI had played it back in the day in the first Xbox and I was unsure if I would still like it, however replaying it was quite a satisfying experience, so sit back and let me explain:\n\n\n--- What is good about this game:\n\n- It contains and blends many many elements from other successful games and does that quite well, namely it has elements from:\n\nMax Payne: graphics and eternal night atmosphere are similar, there is a slow motion mode here as well, named Dilated Perception and even the game's name has the same pun (max payne/max pain, bloodrayne/blood rain). To top it all, there's also a level where you have to escape from fires & explosions, much like in a Max Payne level!\n\nReturn to Castle Wolfenstein (and the Raiders of the Lost Ark Indiana Jones movie): the game is filled with classic power hungry Nazis who seek supernatural relics, as well as zombies, vampires and other monsters, you couldn't ask for more! You can feel the rottenness in the air everywhere! (the spiders of the initial levels even reminded me of Dead Space's necromorphs at times)\n\nDevil May Cry: similar gameplay, where you wield both a close range sword-like weapon (dual blades in this case) and a long range type weapon, namely pistols, rifles and rocket launchers!\n\nYou also get to jump quite high, which is great, since you avoid much platforming and feel like a true vampire. In fact, Rayne's single jump is of the same length, if not a bit greater, as Dante's double jump!\n\n- The atmosphere and music are quite good, despite their age, you have your classic zombie/vampire/third reich horror setting, where the dawn of the day is almost nonexistent. However, since it's an action game and Rayne is quite unstoppable, it's not as scary as, say, the Resident Evil or Dead Space games, where your movements are more confined (though there is a level where a horde of worm-like zombies chase you and you are weaponless and can only run, that was quite a tense and scary moment).\n\n- The heroine of the game, Rayne, is a really hot and kickass redhead, pretty much the female half-vampire equivalent of Blade and she kills/dismembers every enemy with quite some style and as a matter of fact she also swears a lot! You'll hear the F-word and B-words (both male and female one) quite some times and towards the end she even shows the middle finger! Not even the God of War games, despite their gore and violence, have so much swearing! She also, like Max Payne, speaks many witty and cheesy lines!\n\nSucking Blood from various enemies is quite cool as well and as is the Blood Rage mode, which is your typical limited time Berserker/God mode, where you are almost invincible for a short period of time... and dismember every poor enemy in your way!\n\nIn a particular level you even get to drive a Mech suit, felt really cool too!\n\n- The old fashioned cheats system the game enables you to input, where among them existed a cheat that enlarged the female characters' breasts (!) and another that showed how the main character would look like if all the weapons she carried were on her body! There's even a hidden thank you message cheat!\n\n- Violence, decapitations, dismemberments, swearing, buckets of blood sprayed everywhere... oh, did I mention violence?\n\n\n--- What is bad about this game:\n\n- It feels too much like a true B-movie (or B-game, if you want) at times and the graphics are quite dated for our day.\n\n- The gameplay is a bit restricted and you pretty much end up doing the same and the same after a certain point, but I cannot totally blame it, since even Max Payne (or other great 3rd person games) had quite a bit of repetitiveness, but I never saw anyone complain!\n\nThe slowmotion ability is not as good as Max Payne's however, as it's infinite and it doesn't really add superspeed to your movements, alas just the ability to see everything slower and move accordingly at your pace, but it gets too slow and boring to use most of the time.\n\nThe game's blades are also limited in their attacks (unlike the long range weapons which have some variety at least) and end up quite boring too to use (except from a stealth fatality attack which dismembers unaware enemies from behind and is quite cool, but rare).\n\n- While Rayne is almost unstoppable (a lot thanks to being able to blood-suck dry almost any enemy, except bosses of course), in the limited occasions where you lose you have to start the whole level from the beginning, as there are no checkpoints or a free save system. That made the game quite frustrating.\n\n- The initial swamp levels are a bit misleading about the game's entertainment factor, as I've heard of people dropping the game because of them. Just have some patience, when the Nazis enter the scene, the fun begins!\n\n\nAll in all, that said, I wholeheartedly recommend the game for cult B-movie lovers: it's dated, cheesy and filled with swearing and gratouitous violence, what's not to like??!","August 29, 2015","true","19.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","15","17","2","0"

You can edit the ini file if You want a custom resolution.\n\nGame\nVery playable, TPP, specially if You like shooting Nazi's + Vampire motives.\nYou can bite foes and suck the blood out of them to replenish Your health.\nMelee is a little bit anoying (targeting system) but looks fun when You activate Blood Rage mode.\nStory is also acceptable. After finishing the game, You will probably want to know what happened later - Me too.\nSo when I'm thru with part one once again (it's more than 10 years that I've played it) I'll gladly head for part 2 because I didn't had the opportunity to play it back then.\nIt's an "old fashion" game so don't expect to unlock anything after ending the game, except some Steam cards maybe.\n\nI recommend the game if You like slashing, gore, vampires and a lot of blood.","August 9, 2015","true","1.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Rayne is a sexy character with cool personality which is the only thing this game has going for it. The lore of Bloodrayne is good but many in game cutscenes are so cheesy its hard to appreciate it . There is a chance that this game might not even work ( I have to change resolution each time I play it and looking at reviews it acts differently on each system )\n\nThere were many hack&slash games like LegacyofKain series or TombRaider that did better job doing combat,platforming,story and definetly better enviroment .\n\n-Stages design is awful . Even with old graphics many games created more creative and realistic worlds .\n-Character interactions are flatout boring and uninspired .\n-Objectives in levels are simply stupid . Sometimes you can't leave until you kill random enemies .\n-Combat feels almost like survivor arena . I can't engage myself in story if enemy placing feels completly random .\n-Camera controls are ok for the period but still I have seen way better . Platforming is a bit jerky too.\n\n\n5/10 - Hard game to enjoy without previous nostalgia . It is a CULT classic for a reason .

It has very interesting story,funny dialogues,Gremans,demons,vampires... All together makes a nice game,especially if you are fans of occult stuff. So why I do not recommend this game? Well I do,but try playing it somewhere else,since Steam didn't move a finger to try to optimise this game. It's full of bugs,dialogues stop at half of a sentence,game runs too fast. I barely mustered enough nerves to finish the game,it was more of running through the levels just to finish the game,than actual enjoyable gameplay. I already own this game on CD and it ran too fast on my new PC and that was the main reason I have bought it here. I was thinking Steam is reliable gaming platform and they DO optimise games,well what can I say... I was wrong,and it wasn't first time,a lot of older games are so poorly or not at all optimised for newer computers.

It takes a few process of course to get it working. Some folks can't and I've seen complains about it. My other complains about this version of the game is the fact the controls do not match the controller you are using. I understand using an actual Steam controller or an Xbox controller may change it or not, its simply wasn't my thing.\n\nAside from the minor negatives aspects, the game itself is wonderful. Storyline is great! I have this originally on the PS2 and loved it. I thought it would be nice to have it on Steam but with those minor issues, I couldn't deal with it really just felt wrong and didn't want to continue playing it on here. Thought it was penny worth game when it was on sale so it wasn't much of a waste or gain.\n\nIt my personal prefrence honestly. Too bad there isn't a middle voting system because I have to give this a thumbs down for those few minor things rather really just putting it as "its okay".","May 5","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm going to be writing a completely honest review from my point of view and honestly, BloodRayne isn't at all a bad game, but that doesn't mean it's directly good or flawless.\n\nNow, onto the review!\n\nBasic Overview: Developed by Terminal Reality and published by Majesco, BloodRayne was originally released on the  PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube in 2002, only being ported over to PC a year later. BloodRayne is an action hack and slash video game and the first game in the series that goes to follow the storyline that inspired a series of films and self-contained comic books.\n\nStory Breakdown: The game begins in 1933, in a place where people seem to believe in vampires, in Mortton, Louisiana, as Rayne's first mission with the Brimstone Society, along with Mynce, her mentor. They are sent there to investigate an outbreak of an unidentified disease in the area.\n\nBrimstone Society-a top secret fraternity that hunts down and destroys supernatural threats; are here to recruit Rayne. However, the other member does not want a Dhampir with the Brimstone society, regardless of the fact that she is only half-vampire and has fewer weaknesses, as the Society is trying to rid the world of Vampires (and presumably people with Vampire blood in them). Eventually they agree to recruit Rayne, and leave her a necklace with their symbol on it (Hence the BloodRayne game symbol).\n\nRayne must face off against Juergen Wulf, the leader of Gegengheist Gruppe (Counter-Ghost Group, abbreviated G.G.G.), which aims to bring Hitler into power through the use of occult artifacts, including reassembling the remains of Beliar.\n\nMenu: Honestly, it's utterly rubbish, and to get to this initially if you're running an operating system higher than windows 98, you will need to play around with game files. Which in of itself is annoying and finicky enough.\n\nControl menus, option menus? Nah, you don't need an easy way to find these, not only that, but it's really clunky all around - even for the time, it's rather crappy.\n\nGraphics: Pretty decent for the time, also a bit blocky compared to others released the same year but still quite enjoyable.\n\nGameplay: I'll start with the things that I really enjoyed, what stands out the most to me are the enemies. Like Doom, it has unique designs and ideas for its enemies, something that wasn't common at the time and it's wonderful.\n\nAlong with them being quite a challenge, the fact that weapons and ammo are so scarce really make the importance of not wasting it prominent. Topped with the unusual mechanics of BloodRyane it allows it to pull some pretty decent stunts like having a survivor behind mountains of stuff in hiding - Making Rayne have to dive through a cracked wall and bust them out to safety.\n\nNow, considering that you spend most of your time going from one place to another, killing one thing after another and going to another place to kill another thing.. You need to make killing, story and levels engaging enough for this to keep the player entertained, and while I do enjoy it a lot of the time, both level design and killing fall flat in doing so.\n\nLevels felt recycled, empty and too spaced out even later on in the game. Animations and killing as well. The first few kills are incredibly satisfying but after about half an hour, it already looses its appeal with its un-changing nature and don't even get me started on voice acting/sound effects such as draining blood.\n\nActually, now that I mention it, we might as well touch on voices and sounds. Now while the sassy one-liners spat from our heroine are actually quite entertaining, it's generally voiced in such a monotone way and it's fairly disappointing to say the least because it could be so much more.\n\nBasic biological creatures have literally one sound when draining them, and so does Rayne, which to be frank it sounds like they hired a porn star just for that part of the voice acting - Not that it is entirely a bad thing, but some variations would have been nice.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Crunch time. It's either a love or a hate. Now, I love me a good hack and slash, but this is so poorly done. Between reused animations, voice clips and the utterly uninspired surroundings, it's really a let down for what the game has to fully offer. It kind of shrouds over how good it -could- be.\n\nShinobi released in 2002 was an example of a much better made Hack and slash.\n\nConsidering it's a PC port and has been added to steam, one would think and hope that it would be optimised to run semi-efficiently on a modern computer, but not only has it not being integrated with steam, it cannot cope on newer operating systems and even as a hoarder/collector of trading cards, the fact they were added before making it playable for steam users and windows 7(and up) users is completely ridiculous.\n\nSo, in it's present condition, I can't recommend it, not on steam anyway - Honestly it's best to just go buy it off GOG(Good Old Games, for those that aren't aware of this wonderful place) as they have at least optimised it to run better on modern machines.","November 2, 2015","false","4.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Melee attacks have no weight or feel to them and combat requires no strategy whatsoever. You can also feed on enemies, restoring your health.  By hitting enemies you increase your blood rage meter allowing you  to slow down time and deal out more damage.   Range weapons also feel very lackluster\n\n-enemies are bullet sponges,\n\n- Levels feel repetitive and poorly designed. Your objectives throughout most of the game remains unchanged.\n\n- Boss battles in general are a joke. You activate your blood rage and then proceed to kill bosses very quickly.\n\n-frustrating last boss fight\n\n- Getting it to work on modern systems may be a pain.\n\nIf you never played this game before you are not missing out on anything.\n","July 24, 2015","false","6.1"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

No no no no no. No no no no no no no no no, no no no. No no no no. No no.\n\nNo.\n\nThis game isn't good any way you try to spin it. Even the ol' "for its time" argument simply doesn't hold water. Even at a $1.99 price point, it's just not worth taking the risk of seeing if it'll even run on your system (which from what I've gathered from the forums is a crap-shoot.)\n\nBloodRayne simply offers no gameplay worth engaging with. At all. Everything about this game boils down to, "Flail around and hope things happen." Your melee attacks have no sense of impact and you're never quite sure you're actually hitting things or not.  There's no way to actually stick to a target either, so you're quite literally flailing at enemies and seeing if things worked or not. It's about as effective as MMO combat. You have very little, if any control over ranged combat. Rayne just kinda runs around holding guns, aiming them every which way and shooting, and from my experience in the game's Normal mode, even if shots do connect, it can take as many as 4-5 shotgun blasts (and even more rounds from smaller arms) to actually drop an enemy...that is if she's actually aiming properly.\n\nThe platforming is also smooshy and unresponsive. Rayne is supposed to lock herself onto small catwalks or power lines and "tightrope" across them, but more often than not, you'll miss those jumps or she'll "animation" through them for some reason and fall through.\n\nEven as a curiosity, just don't! This isn't a "so bad it's good," like a lot of games can be.

However, another user of Steam was kind of enough to setup a guide as to how to get the game running and playable, so those who are struggling, go to this link and check out the guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=460252724 I can confirm that it works.\n\nAs for a review of this game: I remember the game to be a lot more fun that what it actually is, but that is mainly due to not having played this game in years, and having experienced a lot better as time went on. None the less, the plot as well as the game itself is not too bad. The gameplay is pretty straight forward and easy to master... just run aroung, hack and slash, unlock combos and enjoy the road. The mechanics of the game however aren't very good (can't be blamed though because the game is quite old). The game feels incredibly speedy, attacks are fast, movements are fast... everything is incredibly fast, so if you get the hang quickly, the game actually ends quickly as well. If you can get the game for $1, then it's really worth giving a shot, considering that it's not that much for a cool game :) otherwise you can rather spend your money on its successor BloodRayne 2 :)","October 28, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is probably one of my favorites below the sequel of course.\n\nThe sequel expanded on this game a lot, but right now lets talk about this game.\nThis game hasn't aged that well. Honestly I bought it through my rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia. The game is great in my opinion with somewhat simple combat. The story is pretty good for a game where you play a hot half-vampire chick in bdsm clothing. Seems like all vampires dress like this, because one of the first vampires you meet is in fish nets and a nun outfit. Anyways, that might have been one of the appeals for the game.\n\nTBH the combat is fun and does a good job of making you feel like a fast mobile vampire. You can slice people up with your blades, shoot with a handful of guns, and even suck blood from your enemies to regain health.\nThe platforming is quite poor as the controls for slight movement isn't that precise. Jumping is a bit hard to get used to and this game wants you to platform quite a bit.\n\nHonestly, I recommend the game and think that even if you weren't a fan of the series that oyu could still enjoy this. Just don't buy that crappy 2D hack n' slash or whatever they made as an attempt to revive the series as some arcadey game.","September 19, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now to fix the framerate and video skipping you need a program to lock the games framerate to 30 in game, i used Dxtory but if you already have a program that can do the same thing it will be fine.

The voice acting is B movie goodness which you will like or hate. The downside to the game is the story is just there, but not very well told.

However, another user of Steam was kind of enough to setup a guide as to how to get the game running and playable, so those who are struggling, go to this link and check out the guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=460252724 I can confirm that it works.\n\nAs for a review of this game: I remember the game to be a lot more fun that what it actually is, but that is mainly due to not having played this game in years, and having experienced a lot better as time went on. None the less, the plot as well as the game itself is not too bad. The gameplay is pretty straight forward and easy to master... just run aroung, hack and slash, unlock combos and enjoy the road. The mechanics of the game however aren't very good (can't be blamed though because the game is quite old). The game feels incredibly speedy, attacks are fast, movements are fast... everything is incredibly fast, so if you get the hang quickly, the game actually ends quickly as well. If you can get the game for $1, then it's really worth giving a shot, considering that it's not that much for a cool game :) otherwise you can rather spend your money on its successor BloodRayne 2 :)","October 28, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had to mess around abit to get the game working (in properties and nvidia insider) though I couldn't get my pad working the keyboard and mouse worked quite well. I always wanted to try this game and though the graphics are dated it was enjoyable watching Rayne sink her teeth into her pray after slicing and shooting way through the enemies. It's  a basic go to the marker killing everything  on the way, sometimes going back over yourself.","May 2","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact I remember playing the hell out of the demo before it was released.\nThe graphics were good for their time and a decent story. What's not to like, you get to kill natzies with twin blades or rip their throat out with your fangs. The problem here is getting the game to run. The developers chose to release it on Steam\nwithout updating the game to run on more recent operating systems. Its is a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to get it to run on Windows 10.\nI suspect  the issue could be its Integration into Steam. I suggest downloading the old demo from  Gamershell.com, (its there I just checked). The game is unique and very original. So do your duty and kill some Natzies dammit..!","December 21, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I will review  on how well this game plays on my pc. I have a phenom x 3 8750 black edition cpu clocked to 3.0 Ghz older cpu but overclocked quite a bit. 8 gig memory ddr2. and a ati 5850 video card also overclocked. When I installed game and clicked play I had to choose settings in a pop up window for video I choose All The Highest Settings  Where it said (will slow down pc) because its a old game and comments were made to where fps were too fast and crashing happened. plays good on those settings. so if having this crashing goining on try this.  I would recomend to others  who like this type of dark games. If you have similar pc to mine dont listen to neg. reviews on game not working. Frame rate and video working fine.","May 11","true","1.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GirPlaysGames/recommended/3810/","GirPlaysGames","Baron von Arthur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GirPlaysGames/","519 products in account","While the game has terrible keyboard and mouse controls and feels jaggy and awkward, the game has some strong supports. Those supports being on the foundation of a fantastic story and lore. The supports themselves being Rayne as a character with a great cast and variety of other characters, including other strong, female characters. There are tons of fun weapons, good graphics for the time of release, the gratuitious violence we -- as fans of vampire lore -- come to expect in a video game where you play as a sexy, half-vampire, clad in leather, that kicks *ss with blades on her arms and stilettos. Voiced by Laura Bailey -- someone completely different from the character's personality -- and does an absolutely fantastic job, with a small cast of other VOs that are done quite well. It's not amazing in any particular way, but as vampire games that aren't VTM Bloodlines, it is a really strong game. A villain you grow to hate rather quickly, some small antagonists that are easy to conjure up the rage to kill violently, a group of Nazis not Nazis to kill and feed on. Everything just works.\n\nIt's a rather nice touch when your vampire doesn't heal passively, but actually has to feed, and when some enemies need to be weakened it's particularly interesting. Rayne has multiple visions, including one that allows her to spot weak prey to feed upon, or if they need to be damaged for her to hold her grasp, or she will be kicked off. Another thing this game has is some interesting technology that's surprising for its time: You can cut or shoot holes into the various Nazi not Nazi flags you find around, and the blood decals stay until you finish the level. Weapons carry over, and you get upgrades as necessary. There are water physics as well, not that you'd notice considering one of Rayne's vampire traits is that water burns her, stemming from old lore that vampires could not physically cross bodies of water on their own, and instead needed to be caried or some such lore as that.\n\nAnyways, onto the PROS and CONS:\n\n+ Nazis are always fun to kill, even if they're technically not Nazis\n+ Vampire lore\n+ Fantastic protagonist, anti-hero\n+ Great cast of antagonists, particularly the sexy butcher\n+ Water and cloth physics, plus tearing the flags, and and jiggle physics too. YEA\n+ Has a very serious story but a number of dark joke from Rayne\n+ Laura Bailey\n+ Soundtrack\n+ Gratuitous violence that suits the game's lore\n+ Arsenal of weapons to choose from\n+ Tons of fun to kill\n+ BIG LEVELS\n+ Rayne's different visions\n+ Feeding to recover health\n+ Vampires AND demons\n+ That final boss, yo\n\n- Takes too much time to build up to Kagan, that by the time I encounter him, I barely care\n- Story is mostly just "Kill Kagan and kill whoever gets in your way."\n- Other VOs aren't as strong as Laura Bailey's performance\n- Keyboard and mouse controls are janky\n- Game that shows its age\n- The very first level requires you to go in water and burn for a long period\n- Fair share of annoying glitches","June 2","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
