"http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/recommended/364450/","murderbits","murderbits","http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/","2796 products in account","From the same people who brought you a game about being an eleven year old girl making her dolls have sex comes a non-interactive non-game that literally takes less than three minutes to "play" and consists of a series of images with some text. In other words, a comic book. Well, actually, it is more like a comic strip. Those creepy religious chick tracts things you find sometimes at a bus stop have more content and are just as interactive (you have to turn the page). Actually, the game's store page has more content than the actual game.\n\nThis isn't a "choose your own adventure" of any kind. It is not interactive fiction. It is a linear click-through that tells you the story of a girl who goes to a party and is groped on the stoop on her way into the party, about three seconds after saying "hi" to a guy. That's it.\n\nOn the positive side, this does have *slightly* more content than one of those tiny little comic strips that come in a five-cent stick of Bazooka Bubblegum.\n\nI came to this title, intending to give it a fair shake and a possibly positive review because the author was mentioned as complaining about how Steam is unfair to developers like her, because they require you to play a game for five minutes before leaving a review and "nobody is going to want to play twice through a sad game about being groped". I figured she was exaggerating about how short her title was, but was happy to give it a try and leave one of those desired reviews that were mentioned. I like to support indie devs and hear more voices in gaming, so why not?\n\nUnfortunately, I discovered that this wasn't a game and it really was only a couple minutes long. I don't really understand why it is on Steam. Not because I'm someone who rails against walking-simulators or "interactive experiences". I believe that not everything that is created with game tools has to be a "game" and while I was not a fan of Gone Home, I really liked Dear Esther, 3am, Homesick, and numerous others. However, this was not an "interactive experience" created by game tools. It is just a very short web-comic. It would be more fitting as a Tumblr, Reddit, or DeviantArt post than in a game store.\n\nIt is too brief to manage evoking meaningful empathy or response from the viewer. You don't know the characters, anything about them, or care about anything that happens to them. The incident that occurs is brief and obviously nobody condones someone being forcibly groped, but a groping in and of itself doesn't elevate the rest of the content to something you care about any more than a two minute store that starts with "a guy walks across the street and then is hit by a car and dies" does. Sure, death sucks, but . . . we don't care about this particular faceless empty vessel of a character.\n\nIt all literally just hinges on a groping to carry it and force peopel to fell compelled to give it more meaning than it deserves, so as not to be the social outcast that isn't basking this outstanding artistic impression in the halo of light that it wants to deserve.\n\nUltimately, this just feels like some high school kid was tasked with having to create a game and the kid couldn't really be bothered, so they slapped together a few pictures and called it a "game" and submitted it in hopes of achieving the absolute minimum effort required by their teacher.\n\nIt seems this is common for this group of indies, though. Go see the MS Paint "game" titled "How do you do it?", about an eleven year old girl trying to figure out sex by mashing her dolls together. Yeah, it has about as much content as Freshman Year. Another title that just belonged in a high school kid's portfolio and not, you know, experienced by the rest of the world. Oh, that game is also on Steam, because Steam will allow literally anything.\n\nOh, but it's "autobiographical" (as they keep promoting about both of these games), so that somehow excuses the lack of . . . everything.\n\nSorry I couldn't offer a more positive review. I came here really expecting to be able to do so. I just never imagined this could be as trivial, inane, and worthless as it actually was. I'm sorry the person had a bad experience in real life, but that doesn't have anything to do with the poor quality of this title. Perhaps as much time should have been put into the content of the "game" as has been put into complaining about people not liking it and leaving negative reviews.","June 3, 2015","false","0.2"," 31 of 55 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","31","55","0","1"

There's no denying it is not a game as such.

What I liked about it particularly was the way it portrayed the generation - the flaky friend, the obviously not as confident Nina. It's unnerving. It makes you think, particularly I'd say if you have a young daughter that may one day grow up to be Jenna or Nina.\n\nOn the minus side, the storytelling is not as tip top as it could be, and some circumstances that arise I could perhaps not see happening in the overall story flow. However, I certainly don't want to use minor critisms to dilute the subject matter  - that is one thing that remains firm.\n\nWhat did I take from it? It doesn't matter what, there is no excuse nor reason.\n\nIt's free, and because of the game time, you really will not lose much of your life giving this brave effort a try.

It feels kind of immature, but it doesn't come off at sloppy. The uh... animated scene however was very vague. It takes you a minute to figure out what is going on. I got literal chills, and then got a bit red in the face. It makes you sit there and watch the unfortunate events unfold for a very uncomfortable amount of time. The way the game plays is simple enough, you get a story choice (I use choice in the vaguest possible way) followed by some dialogue and then you check your phone. The game gets unhealthily eerie however, as every time you check your phone you are left with silence from your friend, Jenna's side. You are left to question what happened, until it is finally revealed she was just late. Thanks for letting me stew in that one.\nWhile I enjoy the art style, the eerie atmosphere, and to an extent the game, I do not think that the message it sends is a good one. When attempting to re-enter the bar where you and Jenna were supposed to meet up, you are grabbed by the bouncer who was hitting on you for the first half of the game and are basically groped. Jenna shows up after he pulls you into an alley, grabs your hand, and pulls you away, into the bar. If Jenna had not been there you can assume what would have happened, and I think I understand that the game was trying to send the message to be careful when going out with friends. But what worries me is the message it actually sends. After pulled inside by Jenna she remarks along the lines of "oh god he's such a creep, you know he tried the same thing with (other friend I forget the name of) they just ended up doing it in the bathroom." And then the game ends.\nI kid you not.\nIt just ends.\nIt ends you with the message "at least she didn't get ♥♥♥♥♥, groping is fine though" which is absolutely not true. The "scene" in question has you, Nina, reaching into your purse for what I assume was a taser or pepper spray. It was DEFINATELY not consented. But the game brushes it off, even mentions that it has happened before. Says it was fine. And then ends the game with a shot of you two dancing.\nIt was like playing SCP-049, but it wasn't meant to be a horror game. Then why am I sitting here, in horror, writing a review? I don't recommend this game to anyone younger than 18. Half the people who played it are probably younger than that. And what message did they get?

It's a short story or possibly even a short film. Either way it isn't a game. You're a girl, Nina, and you go to a bar because your friend told you to. Your friend is late and you get sexually assaulted. Then it ends. The player has no agency or choice in anything. That could possibly be the point though, as in the lack of mechanic is there to mirror the lack of choice the character has as well. The feeling of helplessness is mirrored in the fact as a player you cannot help her. But, the problem is, you don't really care about the character. For a short story, short film, art game, whatever this is where the entire point is the story you should have to care about the characters. This game has no back story, no character building, no world building. Nothing. The most you really learn about Nina is she drinks long island ice teas. I think the game relies on the fact you will feel bad because it's a true story. To be fair, I did feel bad through the assault but that has nothing to do with the game. I'm just a human being with empathy and sympathy and I will feel bad for someone who is assaulted. But this game did not truely shape my feelings. Thinking about it, this game relies solely on that ending scene of the assault. Without it the game is nothing. Without those outside feelings, the game has absolutely nothing.\n\nI do not recomend this game. If it sounds interesting to you, then maybe.

Her closest friend Jenna invites her out to a local bar in hopes of breaking Nina out of her introverted and sheltered shell she had built herself into. Jenna, being the  party girl  she is, is unresponsible to Nina's texts as she arrives onto the agreed meeting place and almost scares her into thinking she would flake out, forcing her to take action into her own hands.  Before Nina could enter the club, she encounters the "attractive" (As Nina puts it) bouncer that stops her and asks her a few nosy questions before she is let through to enter. After Nina allievates her self destructive behaviour, she walks outside with her phone in hand, still expecting a text from Jenna. The bouncer approaches her again, but this time has other things in mind. He pins her against the corner of some alley and begins to feel Nina up, molesting her while holding her arms into a locked position. Jenna arrives onto the scene to break it up and takes Nina inside, Jenna begins to explain how the bouncer molested more of Jenna's friends and how it was irritating having to deal with him. As Nina finishes grasping her face in "trauma" she looks up into the mirror to discover Jenna trotting away back onto the dance floor.\n\nConclusion\nIn the end, this is only a short story, it's free and you shouldn't expect much from it. The whole purpose of this is to raise awareness for sexual harassment I believe, I also think this actually happened to the creator once. Ultimately I believe the message barely hits home, as it's trying to portray the fact (or the creator's opinion) that nobody cares about harassment when it's hardly true.  Jenna leaving the bathroom probably says more about how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a friend she is, as opposed to her trying to be represented or being the "embodiment" of society in this story and telling us how nobody cares about victims of sexual harassment.\n\nHonestly, I'd suggest you do something else with your time as opposed to playing this short novel game, I'd apathetically advice against getting this game or even talking/discussing about it.\n\n","May 29","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This point and click story has only one good thing: Pretty art. You are pesented with a false sense of choice with typically two options in different screens. One is more of introvert, the other an extrovert. You essentially decide whether or not you are going to wear make-up, and then if you should wait for your buddy Jenna. Inevitably, the bouncer assaults you, which is about the only confronting part of this project. After that, you're traumatised. The end.\n\nNow, it's not that the we should invalidate the story. This is based off actual events. Horrible things happened to the developer. That being said, it's a sort of story that works better as an animation rather than a series of circumstantial multiple choice questions. The person 'playing' ultimately does not 'win' regardless of which path is taken. There is no actual point to offering more than one answer, because the conclusion and the story format is always the same. It also seems a little confusing to offer more than one answer when this idea is autobiographical. If we are invited into her story, it seems it would make more sense to keep this to a single, straight line for the events unfolding. If the idea is that no matter what happens, the character is not prepared for the assault from the bouncer, then perhaps instead of two questions resulting in the same thing, multiple options should have been made available. What if we waited for Jenna to return? What if we got the option to not drink? Of course, that would be breaking from the autobiography of this tale.\n\nMy final issue with this is who is the intended audience? I assume it's for everyone. Are we looking to learn the devestation of sexual assault, or are we just meant to sympathise and relate to Nina? I would advise people who are genuinely triggered by these themes to not 'play' this. There's nothing here for someone looking to deal with it to gain any sense of empathy, it's just the telling of a story. With that being said, I have been put into situations where this sort of thing has nearly happened, and this thing left a sour taste in my mouth. If you want to call it art, that's your perogative, but that doesn't really excuse how disappointing this thing was. I like to think Nina is doing better now, but I'm sorry, this just bothered me.","October 4, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The window can be resized, but the image stays the same. This means you can make the window so small that you can't see anything or so large that black bars cover the right and bottom of the screen. You can fullscreen the game, but it just adds bars to the right and bottom to 'fill up the screen'. It is a technical travesty.\nThe art is what you would expect from a deviantart web comic and even though the game took less time to play through than it does to review (about 3 minutes), several frames are repeated over and over again.\nTaking a page from bioware's book of game design, any choices made will lead to the same consequence, and your selections only sometimes change what people say.\nThe story revolves around the pink haired creator of the game, Nina, wasting her education sneaking into ♥♥♥♥♥♥ college bars and getting drunk on her parents dime. After getting "pretty druuuunk" and referencing marijuana four times in three minutes (for no reason whatsoever), the creator of the game gets kissed by the bouncer and the player is rewarded by a three frame wiggling animation (which I believe are the two of them groping each other). The author then stares at a mirror for several seconds before wishing she were smart enough to get a real degree at a real university. The game ends.\n\nOverall I have played worse games, but I have played very few games that are both completely devoid of content and remarkably callus to people who have actually been abused.","June 3, 2015","false","0.0"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","15","32","0","0"

It's a short, interactive story that allows the player to experience what the designer intended in a more visceral way than simply watching an animation or reading a description of the event. The idea here, at least to me, is to demonstrate that women ultimately face the threat of abuse wherever they go, and that even those people who have to deal with that threat every day can brush it off in unsettling ways that just perpetuate our problematic system.\n\nWhen you finish, the events are likely to sit with you a while. It's really something that deserves unpacking. The fact that the choices make very slight changes to the text you see and the way events unfold, but that the story still plays out in essentially the same way, with exactly the same ending, reinforces the fact that these kinds of abuses are completely out of the hands of the people they're committed against, and changes to one's own behavior have very little impact on when and how things like this happen.\n\nRecommended, everyone should play through it at least once.","June 3, 2015","true","0.2"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","12","28","0","0"

This is a story, a short vignette, and a brief but affecting experience. You won't be jumping or shooting or solving puzzles. If you're looking exclusively for something like that, this won't be your kind of thing.\n\nIf you enjoy very human stories that express real life experiences, anxieties, and fears in a very honest way, you should give this game a go.\n\nNina's games tend to express an emotional vulnerability which is rare in any medium, and rarer still in the world of games -- even considering the indie world. Engage with her games while keeping that in mind and you may find yourself surprised at the emotional resonance she's able to evoke.\n\nSome other reviewers have complained about the lack of actual branching despite the illusion of choice. These reviewers have missed an important point. It's natural for survivors of sexual assault to wonder if there's something they could have done differently to avoid the situaton -- maybe if they waited at the apartment longer, or took a different route, etc. The lack of branching here isn't a product of laziness, it's an intentional design decision which plays into the very anxieties the story expresses.\n\n\nAnd for the reviewers spewing all the bile: it's not like you paid for it anyway, so what's with all the hate? You said it yourself, it only took a few minutes. So get over yourselves, just because you didn't like it doesn't make it worthless.","June 3, 2015","true","0.1"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","9","23","0","0"

There are no choices to be made, other than marginally different dialogues that don't change the events of the story.  It's very short, but it's also free.  It tells an unsettling story involving sexual misconduct, so if that upsets you, be warned.\n\nThe art style goes well with the creepy music and strange pacing.  The effect of the main character always looking toward her phone during uncomfortable scenes struck me as particularly genuine.  How often do we look towards distraction while in potentially embarrassing situations.  The story is told fairly realistically in its portrayal of a awkward inexperienced girl unable to identify the severity of the danger in a particular social situation.  After an disturbing encounter, she is at a loss on how to handle it.\n\nThe ending could use work.  It was sudden and offered no closure, but I think this was deliberate.  In real life there would be no closure.  People would continue on as they always did, and the girl would still be at a loss for what to do.  Those around her would take their cues from her and not react in outrage, since she was too stunned to show outrage.  It's interesting how much a criminal can get away with if they just smile and pretend they're doing nothing wrong.  I'm pretty sure that's what happened here, and it was only with reflection that Nina realized how terrible that situation was and how much worse it could have gotten.\n\nTo the writer/developer:  Even if this is based on true events, for the purposes of relating the story to others, it would have been a good idea to include some kind of ending text.  All it really needed was a paragraph or two summing up the end of their evening and how life just continued on after that night, regardless of what happened or what almost happened.\n","June 1, 2015","true","0.2"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","5","19","0","0"

None of the choices impact the story.\nHowever, it's important to note that the story is autobiographical.  So is it fair to expect the maker to change a highly emotional, true experience?  I don't think so.  We were invited to share in her story, and to explore the concepts of "what ifs" is not healthy.  Instead, this acts more like a cautionary tale on the reliability of friends and the reflection of decisions once made.\nI would have liked to see more depth to the story and the characters.  I think it would make a great introduction to a longer vignette about how Nina learns to be assertive or more independent.\nRecommended because it is worth the time it takes to play.","June 2, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","0"

However, the groping scene, in which is the best I can call it, seemed a bit messy, in which I didn't understand what was going on until the next scene with her being groped by the bouncer. Also, there seems to be no real build up between leaving the bar and the scene itself. Again, it could be a way of showing that these things happen when you least expect them to, but in each scene themselves, you couldn't tell what was happening until after it was all said and done.\n\nAlso, one personal pet peeve that most of these games fail to place in, is the feeling of choice. For this story, you have to enter the shoes of the main character so to understand better the feeling of danger that women can face on a daily basis. However, you're strung along, unable to make a choice on what YOU would do in this same situation, taking out the immerson of being a game itself.\n\nOverall, if this was the first game the creators have made, then I believe they have a good jump start in making the dangers to women a more widespread acknowlaged situation. However, in order to do that, a little more work is needed. For a free game, you have nothing to lose when trying it out.","April 20, 2015","true","0.9"," 13 of 40 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","13","40","0","0"

They aren’t something that happens only in places and times of great remoteness and high drama, beyond the walls of everyday experience… they are (at present, though hopefully not forever) a part of the landscape. And it’s a part of the landscape that many of us never experience and get to look past if we choose.\n\nFreeman has a solid history of using interactive media to capture and communicate true-ringing life experiences: youth and innocent curiosity in 'how do you Do It?,' illness, body image, and anxiety in 'Mangia,' romance in cyber- & meat-space in 'Cibele.' I think my first interaction with her work was ‘Space Dad’ from Space Cowboy Jam 2014, which uses a simple game structure to tell a framed story of a young girl imagining what her often on the road trucker father’s life is like. Deceptively simple, but clearly heartfelt. That is, I think, how I would boil down all of Freeman’s work that I’ve played so far:\n\nDeceptively simple; clearly heartfelt.\n","May 26","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
