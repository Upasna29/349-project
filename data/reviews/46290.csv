"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ionicazza/recommended/46290/","ionicazza","George Costanza","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ionicazza/","146 products in account","This, is a game for Die Hard Strategy fans, and I mean DIE Hard, the kind that will micromange and face extreme Difficulty and Realism, wait hours for anything to happen, and still be entertained. Well, I come from this point of view.\nThis Game is not for the faint of heart, so if you've only played basic, or no RTS games, you really should steer clear of this one, and try some more popular titles. As for those who are experienced, this review is for you. Theatre of War is a very advanced strategy game, that is very hard, a challenge i'm sure you and I would gladly take. TOW combines Historical Accuracy and somewhat realistic gameplay to create a real platoon commanding feel. Extreme detail had been given to every object and how it interacts with others on the battlefield. You can play as the obvious All-Stars, USSR, USA, and UK, and some underdogs such as poland and frace are included (underdog if you look at it like I do), and each of these playable countries has a wide variety of units and missions to choose from. Missions are usually fun, however sometimes it can get tedious, defend this, attack that, over and over, but it varies in mission and out from time to time. Unfortunately, some common problems do plague this game, as with most realistic, large scale RTS games, the storys are quickly fed to you in a short amount of writing, and then its off to unscripted action, I know a lot of players enjoy a detailed RTS story, so you won't find one here. Further more, unit responsivness is slow, and will not act in a way a real battlefield scenario would play out, standing around, not reacting to rather obvious things, and would stare at an enemy, only firing a weapon slowly. However on a large scale, details can be put aside and the gameplay works and isnt unbalanced, using the right tactics and playing smart will always fetch you a win. This game really reflects 1C as a whole.\n\n--Pros--\n+ Realistic and Accurate\n+ Long Campaign Time with Plenty of missions\n+ Hundreds of different units all very well detailed\n\n\n--Cons--\n- Freindly and Enemy units are slow in response\n- Hardly a detailed story\n- Repeditive\n","February 16, 2014","true","78.3"," 76 of 95 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","76","95","4","1"

The level of realism is well beyond any other game of this type out there. Improper planning and use of tactics are punished over and over again by a good AI. Hundreds of units are modeled and at your fingertips and variants within each vehicle type are meticulously researched and detailed. Elements such as range, armor penetration and the intangibles such as shock and moral are accurately represented. I love the fact that you can actually use infantry for more than cannon fodder and can build an actual combined arms plan of attack for a given objective.   For those who are saying this game it too difficult or the scenarios take too long, fret not there is always the arcade build and unit-spam RTSs out there like Command and Conquer and Age of Empires……this one is for the big boys.","July 31, 2014","true","8.6"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","29","38","0","0"

Saw a panzer 3 kill a Pershing point blank. The game is trash all around with poor workings.\n\nThe idea of it is cool but it really is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. The infantry are just autistic and useless. Plus they really tried to copy Men of War, what pathetic garbage is this? Not worth your 5 bucks. DO NOT BUY IT.\n\nSecondly it is a not a die hard game for die hard RTS players. Whoever even says that must literally be off their nut. The game is very tedious yes, which makes it have good features of micromanagement. But the fact of the matter the AI is broken and predicts your moves a lot in the game and usually out guns you. Plus the Germans are just garbage in this game, yes suck it you Russian praising garbage.\n\nRussia lost 128k tanks in WW2, Germany lost 48k.\n\nRussia lost 14.8 million men in WW2, Germany lost 5.8.\n\nGermany was fighting two fronts and all over the place. I would not even dare review ♥♥♥♥♥Thunder the pay to win. Like how Anon showed the world conversation about the Dev's Nerfing American planes and giving unrealistic buff's that never happened to Russian aircraft.\n\nAmerica is actually decent in the game. But other then swarm tactics they fall apart.\n\nGermany is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke the end, typical Russian superiority complex.\n\nRussian's are literally Goku and cannot die. The statistic's are beyond unrealistic.\n\nBritian for some reason is god tier as well. They boist good tank hunters.\n\nYou can play as anyone and murder Germany really in this game.\n\nWhoever says this game is good is just the whatever to this game. Want a real review of a person who disliked this game? Not like 5 sentences and then a dislike? Because you people love downvoting their reviews. I can tell you now I sure as ♥♥♥♥ seen plenty of those.\n\nThe game is a piece of trash and I am amazed a company spends to make a kraut killing simulator.\n\nI am not even a German main'er in games, But I can tell bs from fact. Now get butthurt and please just downvote me into oblivion.","June 25, 2015","false","15.5"," 75 of 135 people (56%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","56","75","135","18","0"

I just bought this game for £2.79 and I bought it with quite low expectations, but when I started playing I was positively surprised. This game might be the strategy game I was always looking for. It's very realistic, especially when it comes to military tactics and strategy. You can actually use the stuff you would use in reality, in this game !!\n\nThis game has a huge variety of units, a big variety of nations ( Poland,France,USA,UK,Soviets,Germans ; did I miss some ?> ) and as far as I know, quite some massive campaigns + extra missions.\n\nWhen your units engage enemy units in to a firefight, it sounds and feels like you are having eyes on a real firefight, the sounds and way the units advance are just perfect.\n\nMy recommendation: EVERYONE, this game is not expensive at all, and nobody will make a big lost buying it. This game will be a lot of fun for REAL strategists who seriously want to have some brainwork going during gameplay, but this game might also be a good start for everyone who has never played strategy games before. All I can say is, GO for IT .","February 17","true","2.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

He stood in the trench, seeing friendly tanks hopelessly shoot German beasts, his colleagues giving their last breaths with faces dug in the mud. Then, suddenly a new order came - regroup and organise a new line of defense. But he didn't. He ran across the battlefield with a deathwish until a 7,92mm Mauser bullet ended his life. He died because of his own insubordination.

Unit AI is reminds me of the old Close Combat in that it does stupid things like run in front of a tank instead of using AT weapon when you tell it to attack the tank. Don't waste your money on this. It's not that it's complicated; though I'm sure a bunch of "I'm special because this game requires superior intellect" crowd will try to present it that way, it's just that this game sucks and is a poor successor to something like Combat Mission.","January 27, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","9","1","11","3","0"

However upon playing the game, I was terribly dissapointed in its abysmal performance and terrible ai, and generally extremely slow gameplay.  After less than one week of playing the game, I gave up on it.  Fast forward to late 2014 when I saw that this title was on sale for $0.99.   99 cents.  Wow, I had to give it another go, and sure enough the game has not only been patched to fix all of its early key problems from when it was first released, but also comes with the most important and critically acclaimed mod ready to install right away.\n\nRight away I could tell that this game was reborn and risen like a phoenix.  Theatre of War has come from an abysmal early life to being without doubt THE BEST representation of company size combined arms warfare of the Second World War ever put in video game form.  I can not emphasize enough how fantastic and near perfect this game is.  In fact I could not believe that I was playing the same game that I first played seven years earlier.  Bottom line, Theatre of War is a masterpiece in the genre of tactical wargames.   A solid 9.5/10 maybe even 10/10.  Yeah, 10/10!\n\nIf you are someone who hates the lame arcadey company of heroes nonsense, then you owe it to yourself to get this incredible and extremely satisfying and PROPER wargame, right NOW!","April 10, 2015","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because of this, the game can get really hard really fast. So if you're not into games that are punishing for every mistake, don't buy this game.\n\nTheatre of War allows players to command various armies of the second World War from Poland to Russia. Every Nation campaign conists several historically based missions. Every unit you use is highly detailed and useful in some way. You command infantry, tanks, artillery, planes, etc.\n\nYou're only allowed a certain amount of troops per mission. Because of this, you will have to choose wisely and make every effort to perserve them in combat as best you can.   Your surviving units gain combat expierence that enhances their skills. Making them more useful in the events that follow.\n\nThe only downside of the game is that it does feel a bit too hard at times. Even on the lowest difficulty.","February 27, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game comes with several campaigns and includes events/nations rarely covered in the war (you can play the Invasion of Poland and France from both sides). The graphics really aren't terribly bad by today's standards, and the combat is slow and realistic. All of your units carry on from mission to mission in the campaigns, and they gain experience accordingly (they are all named and have semi-independent portraits so you can follow individual soldiers or squads if you are so inclined). The game also comes with a nice editor and plenty of user made missions on sites like Moddb.\n\nOverall, for $5 its a steal. It is the only game in the series that actually works on my PC without huge frame rate issues, and it is the most diverse in terms of units, dates, scenarios, environments, etc. You more than likely won't regret the dropping the modest price on it.","September 21, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
