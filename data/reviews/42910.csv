With its amazing sense of satirical humor, Magicka really does bring out out the laughs very often. The game also has an amazing blend of gameplay, music (which I must say is very good for most Paradox games), and graphics, which really is great for the environment, but especially for the Magicks.\n\nI think the only con for this game is the optimization, which makes the game run dreadfully on potatoes. And majorly, the bugs, probably the biggest downside to this game, makes some areas almost unplayable. However, the support from Paradox is very good and really puts the game up-the scale.","November 25, 2013","true","89.9"," 217 of 243 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","217","243","0","10"

If you look further you will see that there is more enjoyment to experience from Magicka than you could ever see from the trailers and screenshots. Magicka has created something that no game had ever done before (at least not well). From just a combination of buttons you can create powerful spells that bare strategy behind them. Of course there are a number of downsides and bugs to this game that when overlooked barely interfere with the gameplay at all and will usually result in a laugh. Make no mistakes, this game is for pure fun and joy.\n\nIf you are looking for a game to play with your friends then look no further because this game is precisely what you need. You are getting a lot more fun out of this game than the price would intend you to believe. At such a low price you get hours of gameplay excluding all of the tremendous amount of downloadable content. Magicka is a co-op game that brings out the evil inside you and your friends. You can be on your way to defeating the infamous Grimnir when out beaming behind you is a beam of arcane from your companion aiming directly for you. Magicka really brings out the troll in most people and with countless of opportunities to kill you your friends will never get bored killing you and reviving you, killing and reviving you, killing and... yeah.\n\nFor the serious competitors that don't like the limitations that Magicka: Wizard Wars gives you but are still interested in the humor and game mechanics of Magicka then the pvp or challenge modes will prove to be very effective gamemodes. As stated before Magicka has a very diverse field of strategy. For example someone will be coming at you with some fire so you have to quickly decide to cast a fire shield onto yourself to become immune to fire and then come at them with the most unexpected attacks in order to win a player versus player match. Challenge mode also includes some strategy and competition. Once you die in challenge you're done for and must start from square one. This means you can compete against your friends and see who is the greater wizard.\n\nNow I bring you the bugs, glitches and problems this game faces. The bugs in this game are usually hilarious to see happen to someone you are playing with and usually funny to watch when they happen to you. These are the small bugs that don't affect you in a huge way when playing Magicka but through your playthrough it is not unlikely to come across a big glitch that will require you to restart the game and have you go back to the last checkpoint. Another thing that could be considered a problem in this game is it's massive amount of downloadable content which could possibly be a deal breaker for you if you just hate paying just a bit extra for a full package. What I must reassure you with is the fact that none of the extra content is required to feel whole although it is a bit depressing when you look at your robes and see a horde of robes unable to play with. When it comes to actual level and gameplay dlc Paradox have done something I must praise them for. When playing online only the host needs the downloadable content in order to play it so essentially you could play every dlc level without ever paying a cent.\n\nThis was the first game I had in my library and it's what got me interested in steam. So as someone who has had their lives changed (or ruined from the access to almost every modern pc game developed) I say buy this game whenever you get the chance. If you're interested in humour, magick, wizards, co-op, being a troll, strategic moves, unstrategic fails, using powerful combos that wipes everything off the screen causing you all to go back to the start of the game, competition or vampires that think no one knows that they are vampires then I highly recommend to try this game out regardless if you're a loner and can't find anyone to play it with.","October 14, 2014","true","90.5"," 137 of 143 people (96%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","96","137","143","14","3"

Cast your first spell, destroy something, kill yourself, burn down a house, melt cheese or just grill some sausages. This big adventure will require skills to learn to cast spells as fast as you can. This is only way to survive sometimes. On top of that you'd rather be smart to find the weak points of many different foes who will come across your journey. Having  troubles passing through an area? Just call some friends and they will help you in a fight or just cast the wrong spell on you :p. Well Magicka is a unique game without vampires ;-).\nI recommend that you also read the e-book : The Ninth Element.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loopuleasa/recommended/42910/","loopuleasa","loopuleasa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loopuleasa/","252 products in account","Updated Review.\n\nOne of the most fun spellcasting systems I have ever seen! Knowing what to cast in what situation has never been more satisfying. The concept itself of combining elements to make spells had me sold, and the game itself managed to value that potential.\n\nThe freedom of doing whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want whenever you want is amazing. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mana bars. No crappy skill trees. No cooldowns. Pure, unaltered, raw power, scaled with your skill level. Some DBZ style ♥♥♥♥ here.\n\nThere are downsides though:\n- arrowhead did one of the crappiest netcodes in existence. Crashes happen. Connections don't. Hosting doesn't work most of the time. Multiplayer is such an amazing experience, be it Adventure, Challenge or Versus and crap like this stands in the way. If you can overlook that, this game is easily a 88/100, but with the crappy 1998 multiplayer, the score is rightfully dragged down to 74.\n- latency in this game is on steroids for some reasons, probably bad optimization\n- too few people play, and because of the crappy matchmaking system you need to know people's numbers and have friends that play\n- they pump out a ton of DLCs, something that I hate on principle\n- the devs aren't really fixing much. They're adding more stuff and grabbing lodsemoneh\n- limited to a max of 4 players per game (and I think having way more would've been so much fun; game is not made for this)\n\nThe PROS:\n- the combinations you can do with those 8 elements is mindblowing\n- so much fun in all 3 modes: Adventure, Challenge and especially Versus if you are at a high skill level and monsters are too weak\n- skill level can be INSANE. One guy can take out 100 other wizards and 1000 mobs, without getting a scratch.\n- single player is a lot of fun: comedic story, fun missions, DLCs aren't bad, they're just short\n- various robes you can put on, with various abilities\n- at high levels of play, the PVP aspect is balanced, but at low-med levels, you can spam a few spells and always win since people don't know how to counter them\n- Versus mode is LODSA fun at high skill levels\n- huge skill roof\n- great physics and offense-defense mechanics\n- intuitive effects of your spells\n\nI recommend it a lot, especially if it's on sale. About the DLCs? I'm not sure. Having the base game is enough imo, the DLCs are really worth it for the extra robes that you can have fun with.\n\nGET YER ROBES ON","June 26, 2013","true","66.0"," 111 of 124 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","111","124","0","5"

It was not the first video game to allow you to design spells by selecting the path, area of effect, effects, and intensities.  The Elder Scrolls: Arena had that in 1994, and there may be earlier examples I don't know about.  It may be the first to allow you to create spells on the fly.  It is also noteworthy for having no limits based on a mana pool or cooldowns.  Instead, the main balancing forces are enemy resistances and the destructive power of your own spells.  It's very easy to make a mistake and kill yourself or your allies.\n\nMagicka is also well known and loved for its voice acting.  Everyone speaks a mix of broken Swedish and jibberish.  Vlad is an over the top Romanian vampire in denial.  Death and Fafnir also sound great.  I would love to know what sort of processing they performed on their voices.\n\nMagicka has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.  It's bombastic, complex, and memorable.  Unfortunately it may be hard to appreciate with it often being drowned out by the sounds of the chaos around you.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nMagicka is very buggy, even by modern PC gaming standards.  Crashes and hangs are common.  Weapons and staves, which may be unique, frequently clip through the map and disappear into the void forever.  Players lose connection in online games often.  The DLC is even worse.  The Stars Are Left has an unpatched bug on the last level, where if you don't pass through the doors in the order the developers expected you to, not only does it crash, but it corrupts your save so you have to start that DLC over.  The fact that is still unpatched is shameful, by the way.\n\nDifficulty does not scale based on the number of players.  The main game isn't that difficult to get through solo, but some of the DLC is very hard without a full party.  I found the final fights in Dungeons and Daemons and The Stars Are Left to be impossible to solo.","November 20, 2015","true","155.3"," 60 of 64 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","60","64","8","2"

The multiplayer is nearly impossible to set up and laggy almost to the point of unplayability once you do, but it's such vibrant, stupid and chaotic fun that you'll ignore such minor negatives in favor of the grander scheme of bumbling wizards.\n\nThe innovative magic system is profoundly complex and joyously destructive to experiment with, and there's a very scientific glee involved with working out your trademark spell(s) or finding the coolest combinations to solve a particular problem.\n\nYou'll also learn to develop a newfound respect for such veterans of the wizardry craft as Gandalf or Dumbledore...  When you recognize just how much obscenely destructive force you have at your unwitting fingertips, it's always impressive when you DON'T manage to disintegrate/melt yourself and everyone in a 4-mile radius when attempting to do something.\n\nWhile the game is fun enough on its own and the writing is of absolutely stellar class, with actually funny wit and some really quite unexpectedly subtle jokes and twists, this game excels at multiplayer.  Yes, the horribly-irritating-to-get-started multiplayer.\n\nMy deepest recommendation is to play this game with 3 friends, preferably with none of you knowing your wizard staves from your rump bristles.  Idiocy and a vast array of destructive weaponry often lead to the best of times, and ignorance of your own strength is the perfect excuse for "accidentally" slaughtering everyone on your team.\n\nThe game starts you off with a resurrection spell, and as with all spells and magic in this game there is neither a mana cost nor a cooldown of any sort...  And you'll be very happy that it is this way, as roughly 98% of player deaths are either self-induced or from friendly fire.  Or some wonderfully flashy combination of the two.\n\nIndeed, the greatest danger you face is not the foe in front of you, but rather your overeagerness to simultaneously shock, burn, freeze and meltingly explode the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ into his primary colors.  Positively philsophical, really.\n\n\nI have never for a moment regretted purchasing this game.  Indeed, my saddest moment was when it finally ended...  for the second or third time.  Along with all the DLC missions.","February 10, 2015","true","80.8"," 59 of 65 people (91%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","91","59","65","27","0"

But that's way too far from the game Magicka is today...\n\nWhich is one of the best Local-Multiplayer/Co-Op/Versus games in all of Steam. I was a late buyer so I got to skip all the supposed bug-fest, but let me tell you this: Right now, Magicka is a blast to play with friends. Be it local or online multiplayer, co-op campaign or versus or survival, with keyboards or with controllers or any mix of all of the above.\n\nAside from the super-robust level of multiplayer options, the game's campaigns (main and all of the DLCs) are amazing. The main campaign is filled with easter eggs, little details everywhere and stupendous and magnificent narrative comedy. I'll be frank and admit I haven't finished most DLCs yet (as I wait until all my buds can get together to finish them in one sitting), but I can tell you that The Stars Are Left, The Other Side of the Coin and Dungeons And Daemons are worth every penny.\n\nThe quality for your money also applies for multiplayer-oriented DLC, which is cheap and adds lots of cool themes, robes with different stats and abilities and weapons that range from The Doctor's Screwdriver to Ak-47s and of course a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of staffs.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit hard to explain as there are truly no games like Magicka: Top down isometric spell casting & mixing shmup with always-on friendly fire is the shortest way to put it. The long one is: You see your wizard from a top-down-with-an-angle perspective, you can cast 8 elements: Fire, Life, Electricity, Water, Cold, Earth, Arcana/Death, and "shield" which gives any combination of elements a defensive use of sorts. All this elements are on their own very weak but once you combine them you can get deadly creative. From mini-volcanoes that light enemies on fire and explode when touched to steam-compressed mines that send foes (and friends) flying away Team Rocket-style to Death-electric beams that freeze to freaking Meteor Showers to casting Death Itself (whom kills someone on-screen at random).\n\nNow remember that the game has always-on friendly fire. Yup, it's a madhouse.\n\nIf Mario Party destroys friendships, Magicka will obliterate blood-related family ties. But in the nicest, funniest and best ways.\n\nAs a lover of couch co-oping, well-executed games, friendship, and... well, games in general, I urge you, TRY MAGICKA. It's very unlikely you'lle ever regret it.\n\nUnless you have no friends, of course. Being burned/electrocuted/bombed-away/exploded into tiny pieces accidentally on purpose is not as much fun when a complete stranger does it.","May 17, 2014","true","60.0"," 37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","37","38","0","0"

Just got an Assualt Rifle in a fantasy game, somehow.  Comedic story-telling aside, Magicka's elemental magic system ironically has a facinating science behind it, with many combinations of the 8 different types of Magic (Lightning, Water, Life, Arcane, Cold, Fire, Earth, and Shield). The game allows you to mix together different spells to form more potent and lethal spells (Water+Fire=Steam, Water+Cold=Ice), as well as enchant your weapon, cast upon yourself, or create an area of effect. With a "Magicks" spellbook, the game allows you to increase your speed, confuse an enemy, or summon a thunderstorm, and many others. The game also rewards and punishes you for different enemies, as you can electrocute enemies doused in water or wearing metal armor, or freeze wet enemies, or burn tree spirit golem things.\nI enjoy playing this game, and would definitely recomend or even buy Magicka for a friend.\n\nTL;DR, mix spells and burn things to the ground.\n\nIce+Ice+Ice+Ice+Earth = ONE HIT K.O.","November 14, 2015","true","13.4"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","34","36","8","1"

They include basic spells with no creativity, no humor, and those ANNOYING magic bars! But, There is one game though, that is very different. Magicka offers fantastic creativity with your spells, as you have 8 elements to choose from: Water, Fire, Earth, Cold, Arcane, Lightning, Shield, and Life. And out of all those elements you can do 5 elements at a time to do spells at people, offering great creativity in the game. For example, you can combine Earth 3 times, and then you can do 2 fire, or Water and Cold and Water and Cold/Ice,Ice,  or Arcane And Water. Some elements don't mix like Lightning and Earth, but can combine 2 for 1, such as Water+Fire=Steam. The game also allows you to combine different spells together in order to make... "Magicks." Magicks are combinations of spells to make "Different" that are bigger and better, such as... "Summon Death, Meteor Shower, Summon Thunder, Teleport and more!" The game is full of humor in cutscenes and gameplay about violence, logic, references and silly stuff that happen all the time! Finally, the game has NO MAGIC BARS!!!!!!!!!!!!! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY!!!!!!!!!!! Finally a mage game that doesn't have magic bars! Screw swords and hammers used all the time! Spam Meteor balls, Chain lightning Goblins, use Force Powers on Evil vampires, and EVEN MORE WITHOUT LIMIT!!!!!! The game has fun single player and multiplayer, offering co-op and fun at the same time. But the game is sometimes full of bugs such as going out of the map, character glitching, and others. The game is fun and I recommend it to people who like to push the limit with magic, have comedy and epic wizardy at the same time. So now guys i got to g- OH SHOOT!  You fell into a hole!

In addition to this, you pick up books because this is like a library sort of, in that you pick up books. The books have element combinations in them that can be used to make spells that do different things than usual.\nfor example. you combine earth, "arcane" element and fire and shoot a fancy meteor fire rock bomb with death magic attached. Then you type those three elements again and cast them with space instead of shooting them, and it turns into the "haste" spell and makes you all fast like that gonzales mouse on looney toons. Then there are lots of things and it turns out vlad's lying don't believe him he really is a vampire.\n\nAlso the game is funny because they make references to everything like Zelda and 300 and everything else you could make a reference too.","October 22, 2013","true","35.6"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","34","42","0","0"

It feels too much like work. And... I kind of suck at it.\n\nI think I'd be more efficient and struggle less with a few more levels of play, but I don't feel compelled to keep trying. The gameplay is uncreative ARPG, and I find the humor too juvenile to entertain. The warmed-over "Swedish Chef" mock-language is painful and unfunny.\n\nI do think Magicka has a good pricing model. The base game is cheap ($10, and on sale for practically free all the time), and the DLC is affordable. You can keep paying for more content at your own pace until you get bored. This works for me. Good system. It's also a decent "beer and pretzels" co-op game; a way to kill a couple hours with friends.\n\nSo... given the low price point, if you are looking for a co-op game, I would recommend Magicka with these reservations.

Travel through 13 stages with 8 different schools of magic that can be combined to make a staggering number of combat strategies against enemies.  Spells and restoring friends from death costs nothing, so the challenge comes from your ability to work as a team and not screw up.  Believe me when I say though that screwing up is a LOT harder not to do than you think.  Combining magic and then deciding how to excecute it while being chased by enemies often makes you mess up your combination and worse yet, your friends can very easily be caught in the crossfire, or spells that don't mix in certain situations will cause a terrible backfire and insta-kill them.  Again, there's no cost to resurrecting your friends, but some players could become frustrated from being killed by their friends more than their enemies.  $10 is well worth a game like this, so grab your friends and see how well you work together!","February 12, 2011","true","10.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","5","5","3","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillless/recommended/42910/","skillless","Peashooter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillless/","238 products in account","Magicka Left Arm\n\nI believe most gamers know what "Nintendo Thumb" is. For those who don't, it is when you've been been using the D-pad or Gamepad for such a long time that blisters and swellings started to appear on your thumbs or other fingers. Well, having mentioned "Nintendo Thumb", may I introduce a new term to you - the "Magicka Left Arm". This "Magicka Left Arm" is the situation where you've been playing Magicka for such a long time that, when you wake up the very next day, your left arm started to become sore and numb and, in extreme situations such as mine, you cannot move your left arm for the whole day. Yes, this has happened and I shall tell you why.\n\nFirst of all, allow me to begin by describing the game mechanism. It is not wrong to say that this game is based on the concept of conventional Diablo-like RPG. You control a character, nameless and hooded, and you roam around the top-down world by pointing and clicking at locations with your mouse. You are free to run around and whack enemies using your melee weapon, though it is not recommended to do so as you will die like a popcorn. What you can, and should, do is to cast Spells and Magick. Notice how Magick is spelt? It is, of course, different from your typical Diablo-type Magic.\n\nIn Magicka, Spells and Magicks do not require mana. They are formed and casted based upon 8 different basic elements: Water, Life, Shield, Cold, Lightling, Arcane, Earth and Fire. Each of these elements are bonded to they keys "Q, W, E, R, A, S, D, F" respectively. (There are two advanced elements: Steam and Ice, formed by combining Water + Fire and Water + Ice respectively) You can cast Spells, such as the "Super Steam Lightling Beam" by first pressing the combination "Q, F, Q, F, Q, F, A, S" and then followed by right clicking. In that manner, a strong beam will shoot towards the direction your mouse is pointing towards. There are many others, and you can experiment more with them once you are in game, though I believe this will give you a general concept on spell casting.\n\nAs for Magicks, they are special magics that can be casted by forming a specific elemental combination and then pressing <space>. For example, if I want to summon an elemental, I will have to press "S, E, D, Q, F, S, <space>". However, one single elemental is too weak and it will be annihilated with in a matter of seconds. So, what did I do? More elementals, of course! After starting the game for a while, I can be seen pressing this elemental summoning sequence repeatedly. I'll be trying to cast 20 or so elementals in a couple of seconds, watch them fight to their deaths while hiding in a shield (opps), and repeat the process. And that, my dear reader, is where I got my "Magicka Left Arm" after 6 hours of game play straight.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I am not saying that you have to spam elementals like me. I personally like to take the easy way out, and watching a bunch of kamikaze comandos fight for me can be quite entertaining. There are many other ways to complete the game, and I will give you the liberity to figure it out for yourself. But then and again, you can be quite certain that your left hand will be quite busy throughout the game. This the fun part of the game, and this experience is what make this game worthwhile. The graphics is not much of a looker (look at the screenshots) and the jokes, though initially creative and great, can get quite cheesy in the long run.\n\nGreat game if you want to enjoy something light and humourous, though watch out for the "Magicka Left Arm". You've been warned - spell casting can be extremely addictive.","January 6, 2014","true","72.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The gameplay is kind of repetitive and boring but on the other hand there are a lot of cheeky references to many different things LOTR and Steam itself included, but it reaches out further than that. The humor is pretty tongue and cheek too which is nice I guess. Hilarity ensues when playing with friends who would much rather kill you for the items you possess than actually defeating enemies. I suppose I had fun with it but I have a hard time convincing myself to play it more. Despite this I cannot give the game a negative review.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/42910/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","In Magicka, you're a wizard. You've got eight elements that you can stack up, mix, multiply, and unleash. You can cast them at goblins, cast them at anything next to you, cast them at your specially blunted sword, cast them at your own face.\n\nSingleplayer mode is a light comic fantasy, narrated by your dodgy mentor, Vlad. The black-clad Romanian wizard keeps pointing out that he's not a vampire, and making bad puns about sinking his teeth into things. It's a mix of satire and pop culture references that'll have you smirking dangerously throughout.\n\n\nLots of care has gone into the way the elements combine and contort in your spells. Combinations shape the form (Missile? Beam? Cone? Wall?) and function (Healing? Burning? Shielding? Exploding? Freezing? Drenching? Zapping?) of each glorious experiment. There's enough variety for every wizard to have his or her own favourite attack style. Mine is a steamy lightning beam that scalds you before dealing bonus lightning damage from the water element in steam.\n\nConcocting these spells is a little confusing at first, as you're commanding eight elements across eight keys, but you're rarely faced with enemies that can't be killed by particular elements. Button mashing will get you far, and a mistake might just surprise you.\n\n\nThe environments are top-down, linear jaunts through bright and breezy fantasy tropes: forests full of goblins, orcish trenches, swamps, mines, the land of the dead. Wander off the beaten path, and you can find powerful equipment and new magic spell recipes that reach beyond the scope of your regular elemental concoctions - spells such as Revive and Teleport.\n\nSingleplayer will soon wear thin, sadly. It's not that you can't beat it with the right spells and an awful lot of goes – it's that if you make a mistake and burst like a sticky water balloon, you get chucked back to the last checkpoint you reached. In once case, that involves fighting three big groups of face-pounding orcs and one-hit-smash-to-deathing ogres, in a row, before you hit another checkpoint. If you quit before you complete that level (perhaps out of, ooh, say, frustration), you'll have to start it all over again when you boot up the game again. Ultimately, you'll hit this annoying boss or that overpowered yeti thing or this boring underworld level and you'll just give up on singleplayer. Then you'll turn to multiplayer.\n\n\nAnd multiplayer is good, when it works. If you've got a few networked computers and three eager friends with Magicka on their Steam accounts, you can enjoy the splendour of four death lasers combining neatly into a super-beam that bursts ogres in seconds. You can have tactics and gambits and laugh as they end with one wizard left, deciding if he wants your gear before he resurrects you.\n\nThe bulk of us, however, will be butting our heads against the brick wall of online multiplayer. At the time of writing, developers Arrowhead have been releasing patches every 24 hours, and they're gradually improving on the terrible connectivity issues. Despite their efforts, you no sooner host a game than Steam Chat dies, Skype calls drop, and flatmates start inspecting the router for flashing lights. For a game so reliant on multiplayer to be fun, there are lots of missed opportunities. There's no chapter select function, no joining mid-session for latecomers or disconnected players, no voice chat, no dedicated servers, and tons of lengthy, wordy cutscenes that only the host can skip.\n\n\nGet it working, and it's great. For £8, you'll get your money's worth before everyone forgets about it. But it could have been game of the year material! Silly wizards.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n69/100\nMAGICKA\nConfused and buggy, but very entertaining under the right circumstances.

The elements can stack together to enhance your spells, and some combinations can be learned to cause special abilities, such as slow time, increase movement speed, revive a fallen teammate, summon a tornado, etc.  You can cast your magicks onto your weapon to give your weapon increased damage, cast in a circle around you to affect all characters nearby, or simply cast in front of you.\n\nEach element has something that will counter it, so not all combinations are possible.  Further, if you try to use one of these when you have an opposites status effect applied (like trying to use lightning when wet), you'll cause damage to yourself!  As an added bonus, all of your spells can also hurt your other party members, so you need to be careful not to kill your friends.\n\nI absolutely enjoyed this game.  The enemies are varied throughout each chapter and each has their own weaknesses you need to discover.  The game keeps you on your toes while allowing you to constantly learn new ways to summon magicks.  The only negative I can say about this game is that it has a terribly steep learning curve.  I played co-op with someone who had played once before and it took me several chapters before I finally understood how all the magicks worked together and could actually contribute effectively to the combat.  I enjoyed these early chapters just as much as the later chapters despite not really knowing what I was doing.\n\nAnother negative about this game (that can be completely ignored) is that the gamepad controls are absolutely terrible.  Literally any other control setup would have been better than the set gamepad controls.  I prefer gamepad, but I had to play with keyboard and mouse.","June 3","true","7.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/42910/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is another very long review. If you just want a summary of my reasons for why I recommend this game skip to Results and read from there.\n\nMagicka by Arrowhead Game Studios is an interesting game that really keeps you on your toes. I use the word interesting because this game has some great concepts although I could easily see them as potential weaknesses to some people. Magicka requires you to use physics and chemistry to create spells and solve puzzles. These include such concepts as freezing rivers, powering generators, and combining elements to create powerful spells.\n\nThe Campaign:\nYou play as one of four wizards who are a part of the Order of Magick. You start their adventure in Castle Alderheim where you are given a quest to save the world. The game includes twelve chapters, which pull you through time and space. You are led by your guide Vlad, possibly a vampire, who continuously points you in the right direction. The campaign requires you to fight many bosses who require different tactics to beat: Jormungandr, Jotunn, The Warlock, Khan, Grimnir, The Aristocrats, Vlad, Death, Fafnir, Grimnir, and Assatur. There are many DLC packs which allow you to play many campaigns and experience a full new game. The campaign has funny dialogue which speaks between English and gibberish. The campaign is rather cut and dry. Each level is essentially the same concept, basically fight the enemies and beat the level. Yet again, this is how most games that fit into this genre seem to be. There are many funny jokes, references, and characters which make this game a blast to play through. In fact one of the Wizards you can select is a Space Marine from the 40k series (plus there are all these game references in the campaign).\n\nGameplay:\nThe enemies tend to repeat themselves and throughout the campaign you typically be using the same spells over again. What most people don’t seem to mention is the difficulty of this game. This game is not easy in any sense of the word, in fact even if you play with more people the game just gets harder. With latency issues and friendly fire can result in a very tough campaign where you will kill your friends more than your enemies. If you play the game solo it can be very difficult and with the patches and updates is even harder now than it was before. There is no mana, no leveling up, and pretty much no real loot. You may find a few weapons throughout the campaign, but they are not going to make a huge difference to how you play the campaign. I personally played the whole game with the M60, but other than that all the weapons seemed to be just as effective as the ones I start with.\n\nUseful Advice:\nMagicka REQUIRES a good keyboard. This keyboard preferably should be a gaming keyboard and should not be wireless (unless it’s a wireless gaming keyboard). In order to preform spells and move at the same time Magicka sometimes requires you to use more keys than you have fingers. If your keyboard cannot handle multiple key-presses then you will not be able to play this game. I would recommend playing this game with a macro-enabled keyboard/mouse in order to fully enjoy the actual campaign. In fact the game can be so difficult that even with macros you will more than likely not succeed in a mission on your first attempt. There are many spell combinations with some of them being very hard to figure out.\n\nResults:\nIf you like bird’s eye view co-op action adventures then this could be a good choice for you. Make sure you are well equipped, ready for a hard challenge, and have some friends. This is a fun campaign, with witty dialogue, and amazing spell casting. If you have a great memory for up to eight letter combinations then you’ll be very good at this game. If I were you I’d play the game with macros, essentially that’s like putting the game from “Insane” down to “Hard Difficulty”.\n\nPros:\n+Spell combinations are almost endless\n+Funny dialogue, hilarious references, and a great story.\n+Many items you can find in the game (with different bonuses and special spells)\n+Lots of wizards to select from with different weapons and base attributes\n+Offers four player co-op experience\n+Nice graphics and smooth visuals\n+Interesting boss fights which require a variety of different strategies\n+Puzzles and mysteries to solve within each level\n+Lots of DLC with new story and characters abound\n+Rather long campaign\n+NO GRINDING\n\nCons:\n-Insanely difficult (especially if you solo or co-op without experts).\n-Spell combinations can be rather cumbersome (not a game for people who are not good with memorizing eight letter combinations).\n-If you are not an expert at memory you typically end up using the same spell through the entire game (rock, rock, rock, rock, rock).\n-I sometimes had issue with random lag in the main menu screen (nothing game-breaking, but could get infuriating sometimes).","March 24, 2014","true","14.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It will most likely work, but like an idiot's imagination, it will hurt and kill you.\n\nThis game is simply amazing, it's more than worth the "I may aswell try it" that can be thrown at a lot of games. Starting off with a small/short tutorial to unlock your magic or 'elements' (of which you can skip if you wish), you'll be thrown into the harsh and dangerous world filled with carboard cutouts of sheep, non-vampires and ever-trusting villagers in order to... Well, save it. (No spoilers!)\nBut gameplay wise, it is diffcult to get used to. The vast combinations of spells pared with the movement and aiming could be the only thing to put someone off. Then again, give it time and you may find yourself loving the ongoing humor behind every unlocked door, the music which helps set the atmosphere like any great fantasy game and the endless comical refferences that just adds to the "Ha! I know that one" that reels you in.\nMultiplayer wise, because you CAN play with 3 other people within the storymode, versus and challenge mode. Yes, you may have connection issuse or lag issues, that's a downside. But! If you should find yourself with your (soon to be ex)friends starting off a story... It may take you longer than you think. This may be the only game that gets harder the more people you have, soley because you end up killing each other on purpose. Truth be told, you can have a lot of laughs without commiting to actually completing this game, to which it only makes it more exciting if you choose to.\n\nFor anyone whose played a classic console game and thought "Wow, I wished they made games like this again." Then Magicka is for you. The elements of a classic are certainly there. For me personaly, it's just a game I feel I want to come back to time and time again 'just because'.","June 12, 2015","true","204.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","1"

While I do love the game for it's atmosphere and general humor, there are glaring shortcomings with the game that hurt it.\n\nThe positive side - the humor and pacing of the story is done very well in my opinion, and Vlad's constant sarcasm and satire punctuate things quite well. While short, the story is just meaty enough to be satisfying and the writer(s) pulled off the 'stable time loop' thing rather well - props to them, where it's deserved.\n\nThe negative side - oi, where to start?\n\nThe casting system. While at first the QWERASF casting system seems fluent enough, the ability of the system to be easily and ergodynamically used under pressure of heated gameplay flounders. For most people (read: non-pro players), heated combat turns into mashing a few powerful, simple combo (such as SDFSDF) repeatedly, if not just mashing the keyboard period. The casting system also suffers from some other problems, which will be mentioned ancedotally below.\n\nOptimisation - I'll be honest: this game isn't optimized for ♥♥♥♥. I have an $1800 gaming rig, not even a year old, and even it gets knocked beneath 20 fps on a regular basis. This hurts - not only does this kill immersion and throw off your ability to maneuvor and position yourself correctly, but the frame skip can wreck your ability to cast. I cannot count how many times I missed an important element in a long combo because my game hiccuped and lost 15fps for a split second.\n\nMultiplayer - Oh boy. Multiplayer in Magicka can be summed up, really, as pay to win. The netcode, coupled with the above-mentioned optimization issues, turns into a flustercuck of laggy, desyncronized chaos. Additionally, some of the paid robes offer massive advantages over the free ones - the biggest offender is the 'Assassin Robe', I think it was - 50% of the regular life, but he runs around twice as fast and comes with a poisoned crossbow to boot, as well as an emergency teleport backwards. This guy in particular is horribly unbalanced - he's so fast most things don't even damage him, and a player mistake that leaves him vulnerable can mostly be avoided by the emergency teleport thanks to the copious cover on most multiplayer maps. He's horribly broken, damned near impossible to kill, and more than capable of making exceedingly fatal hit and run attacks with impunity.\n\nDesign direction - Really, I can't tell where the devs were going with Magicka. The easy death, and equally easy revive that get's pushed down your throat both basically force you to play co-op (you're a squishy bugger by yourself, and you can't be revived either. Nevermind that the game doesn't scale for single-player play...), and the aforementioned mechanics and general air of the game make it feel something like a LAN party game, almost like an overglorified, gory Mario Party spinoff. On the other hand, the casting system and pace of combat, at times, feel like they were going for a hardcore combat game with tight tolerances and no room for mistakes. This shift becomes brutally painful right around the dwarven caves level, which in my opinion is basically the 'stop-having-fun' level (if you've tried soloing it, hell even trying it with a single partner, you'll understand why)\n\nClarity in Combat - this is arguably more of a personal one, but I found that in the heat of battle I had a difficult time identifying enemy units whilst trying to mash out complex combos. More over, I found that the wet and burning status debuffs killed me more often than anything - it's not directly clear, from a glance, that you're wet/on fire, it doesn't jump out at you, the wet effect in particular. With the effect of trying to channel lightning when wet being rather disasterous, it becomes a point of pure aggrivation when you die simply because there's too much ♥♥♥♥ going on at once to keep track of all the little details like that, again especially considering they dont' really jump out at you.\n\nIn all, while I really do enjoy Magicka and personally find it halarious, I cannot, really, recommend this game to anybody. In fact, I would whole-heartly tell people to avoid it like the plague unless you can overlook all the glaring, broken elements of this game (pardon the pun).","December 27, 2013","false","40.8"," 106 of 202 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","106","202","0","8"

While there are a couple of dozen predefined spells ("magicks") in the form of spellbooks that need to be discovered throughout the game to be used, most of the time players will be using spells of their own design, creating them by combining any of the 8 different elements (water, life, shield, frost, lightning, arcane, earth and fire). Some elements cancel each other out, while other can be combined to make new elements (water + fire makes steam, for example, which can be combined with lightning to increase damage as lightning will do more damage to enemies that are made wet by steam). There is no mana or similar system in Magicka so there are no limitations to how many spells can be cast in a row, and the combat is fast paced.\n\nIf you play with friends  you'll probably occasionally kill them or get killed by them. Their earth projectile will accidentally bounce off your head or you'll lock beams and explode or you'll be struck by a wayward lightning bolt while your friend is off to the side pretending that he wasn't casting anything and that he's not right now ransacking your bloodied corpse to steal your gear.... It is all part of the game, and half of the time it's what makes Magicka so much fun to play with friends. Just remember: W+A is Revive but you cannot cast it while wet because you'll die. Like I did. (Many times.)\n\nIn addition to the hilariousness of the random self- or friend-inflicted deaths, there's also a lot of humour in the story. The NPCs speak a sort of gibberish version of Swedish which sounds comically silly (even more so if you speak Swedish, I'm told) and the story is riddled with pop-cultural references. Theme-wise, it's standard RPG fare: you are a wizard trying to save the world, fighting goblins, orcs, dragons, even Death.\n\nIf it weren't for the fact that it is also frequently buggy, Magicka would be outstanding. Unfortunately, the game has a tendency to randomly crash in loading screens or during cut-scenes, it occasionally bugs out so that you can't move during a boss fight, and match-making can be iffy. In addition, the game does not allow to skip through all cut-scenes, which can get tedious if you are repeatedly redoing a boss fight, and I was personally annoyed by some design choices – specifically the fact that "examining" a statue prevents you from casting anything for a few seconds while the dialogue plays out, but several huge statues with huge 'hitboxes' were placed in an area littered with enemies and hazards, as a result of which I was getting killed because simply going near the statues would trigger the "examine" action and I could not do anything to avoid damage.\n\nThese minor frustrations mar what is otherwise a great game, but Magicka is nevertheless an incredibly fun co-op experience.","January 31","true","21.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The top-down Action RPG. It replaces the standard combat with one of the most innovative spell casting system I've ever seen in a game. Eight different elements that can be combined and used in a myriad of logical and easy to understand ways. Firing lightning at your enemies is more effective if you dose them with water first, combining cold and water makes you shoot ice shards and so on. It is easy to learn and easy to use even if some of the higher tier spells require a bit of practice.\n\nThe graphics are simple but functional and the sound is somewhat lacking, the characters speaking some perverted form of Finnish mixed in with a good deal of gibberish.\n\nThe storyline and characters are as random as it gets and the entire game is filled to the rim with old pop culture references. A little fun but not much, this is a game that should be played for the gameplay and nothing else.\n\nA great buy, especially with friends.","November 3, 2012","true","23.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

Fun, funny, and challenging... it makes for a very amusing experience. The standard campaign is relatively brief, but there is a lot of DLC content. Some of it is cosmetic and can be ignored, but much of it provides actual content and you will likely want to pick it up to get the full experience. Magicka also makes for unique and enjoyable multiplayer gameplay, if you find some people to play with.\n\nAs I alluded to, the innovation inherent in the main gameplay mechanics is the primary reason that Magicka is something worthy of being in your library. There isn’t much else quite like it, and absolutely nothing of the same caliber.  You have to rapidly press certain button combinations to cast various spells while simultaneously controlling your character and aiming in an isometric view. It is pretty unique and intense. I personally found it more comfortable with a controller, but it also works well with a standard keyboard and mouse set up.\n\nAnd while the exciting gameplay is definitely the soul of the game, it is also quite funny and charming too. The art style is very fitting to the mood of the game; and although the graphics aren’t the best, they feel appropriate. With the addition of the mumble language, silly plot, and hyperbole of blood/gore, the jovial nature of Magicka becomes clear. This lighthearted atmosphere synergizes well with the unique gameplay to create an experience that is incontestably fun.\n\nThe key feature of the game being the innovative gameplay mechanics, I recommend anyone looking for some variety check it out if they haven’t already. I highly recommend playing with other people though; it’s much more fun and much less frustrating (since you can revive each other).\n\nAlso the Versus and Survival modes are pretty fun, especially since the game supports local-coop (as in sitting on a couch with your friends, as it was in the old days).\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","40.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I feel like Magicka has too many DLCs but the game itself has a lot of content already.\n\nAs a singleplayer game...it's kinda boring after awhile.It's the Multiplayer aspect of it that makes it a great game.It is a okey-ish experience as a singleplayer game but I really feel that it was built as a multiplayer.\n\nMagicka is a fun experience either way and you should at least try the base game.","October 5, 2014","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The spellcasting mechanics are great and there are so many possibilities with the 8 elements. The story is is not the most developed but still has a few twists. The dialogue and gameplay is filled with references to other games and movies. (Zelda, Kirby, 300, Star Wars, etc...)\n\nThere are without a doupt some bugs and some weird interations but these are the only thing this game was missing to be perfect and I hope they can fix these in Mgicka 2.\n\nPlaying the story solo has some hard bits but can be overcome by using the right elements. But when you go into co-op its a completely different story. Having played throung this game in co-op a few times I can say it is much more easy. (I do not think there is any scaling difficulty in multyplayer) The goal of the game in co-op is to not kill your friends and make spell combos that can dessimate entire legions of goblins. You could also just go around with an electric shield and cast thunder everywhere.\n\nSo fun, even better as co-op.\n","December 31, 2014","true","55.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They're portrayed as miracle workers; quick-witted masters of arcane elements. What wizards are handled as, though, are simple glass cannons -- frail men with a limited attack pool governed by arbitrary numbers and points. The player is forced to forsee several actions and plan ahead, all to achieve the same effectiveness as the burly fighters who charge headfirst into the fray like a bloodthirsty, brain-dead zombie.\n\nMagicka is the first game I've played to do wizarding right. Magicka puts you in the role of a rookie wizard, and you progress through the game not by leveling up or watching a magic meter, but through experimenting with combining the eight elements you are given, much like you would expect a real wizard to. What happens when you mix fire and water? Does lightning do more damage than earth? Can you add cold to this spell to make it more effective? You can use all elements infinitely, so the only limit to what you do is what you have yet to try.\n\nThat's just the casting mechanics. Mix it in with the tongue-in-cheek style of the world of Midgard, based on Scandinavian mythology and driven by pop-culture references. This game has many moments, from hilarious tributes to many fandoms to the excitement of perfecting your favorite spell. It was well worth my time and money.","January 17, 2013","true","54.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Magicka takes all the RPG cliches and uses them as it satirizes all of them at once, which is  (somehow) one of the strongest point in the storyline.\n\nThe growing up system is another strong point; instead of getting more hp or atack or ♥♥♥♥, you'll just learn new magicks, which are just special combinations of your elements, and you'lll become faster at memorizing and using them.  You'll have to solve all your adventure with "only" your 8 elements, their possible combos and the way you cast them, which will make the diference between a vulcano crater, a burning sword or a burning stone armor. Anyways, this game uses simple concepts and turns them agains themselves. It's a mastercraft  with charismatic characters, funny dialogues, a decent plot and tons of friendly fire.\n\nIt has just 2 bad points: First of all, it has good days whenever everything works fine, and bad days, with many crashes and/or bugs. On the other hand, there is something horrible: it has HUNDRED OF DLCs!!!! So despite many of them are just run&andkill games (and are not worth paying), you can still have MOAR MAGICKA, MOAR FUN AND MOAR ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-HIENA LAUGH WITH YOUR BUDYS.","April 14, 2014","true","81.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I fell in love with the game long time ago,seriously I have no idea why I didn't complete it yet. Game itself is really fun but challenging while you play alone. On the other hand when you play with friends it may end up being a free-for-all deathmatch instead of doing storymode in co-op.\n\nThe amount of possibilites this game gives you is incredible,all that spells and weapon enchants you are going to make, not even talking about the hidden stashes. Story is not the best, but it ain't Far Cry it's Magicka it's all about the comedy and full of action co-op. The fact that on almost every loading screen you can see a sausage and the amount and kind of achievements you can get is heartwarming. The environment this game puts you and the atmosphere it creates is indeed unique.\n\nTL:DR - Game is fun just do it.\nPros:\n+Lots of possibilites\n+The amount of references to TV shows or different games\n+One of the best co-op I've played\n+2GB means you download it fast and play for loooong\nCons:\n-Amount of ways to kill your friends may distract you from the actual game","February 21","true","22.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In a lot of movies and games the characters mention that magic is "dangerous" and can be harmful to yourself and others. This is THE GAME that represents the dangers of magic. The amount of times I've killed myself using lightning while being wet or summoning a boulder to crush me where I stand are numerous. The balance of simplicity of no levelling, only slight spell unlocks or item pickups and the complexity of having to mix and remember each spell is great. This game is most fun playing in coop which is also a lot easier than trying to overcome the bosses alone. Also great for LANs!","March 8","true","31.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is fun with friends and alone, especially given how easy it is to hit your friends with a bit of "friendly" fire... and or accidentally kill yourself. There are also a few special spells that can be learned via items found, these spells require the combination and are then executed with a button press. Such as reviving one of your friends who you probably just blew up a moment ago...\n\nI think it's got lots of replay value, the story is cute and funny with tons of references to the genre. The game is in and of itself a bit of a parody.\n\nI personally don't have any issues or criticisms of the game, it's not perfect, but the quirks are all part of its charm.  I would recommend it to anyone that has a sense of humour, especially if you have some knowledge about other games in similar genres. It's especially fun with a group of friends (up to 4) but is still very entertaining on your own. I personally found it pretty additive.\n","March 28","true","72.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After that, it's fun with friends, engaging campaign with humor.\n\nThe many spell combinations can be a little frustrating, but experiment and you'll find something that works for you, and the enemy you are fighting. Quite by accident, I discovered E cast, A-S-E cast - a shield followed by 3 or 4 proximity mines in front of the field.

It also has a unique and well thought out combat structure. From the start of the game you are given access to all 8 elements (water, life, shield, cold, fire, earth, arcane, and lighting) which can be combined for various effects. Each element affects the area differently depending on the form and combination.\nif you use it in its direct form (some are spray, earth is projectile, and others are beam) it is mainly a attack. if  you use say, earth + shield, on yourself it creates a body armor. If you use the same combination directly it surrounds you with a rock wall. If you use it as an Area of Effect it causes a small earthquake around your character. And if you enchant your melee weapon with it the weapon will also vary the effect.","July 27, 2012","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let's you be creative with all the vast magic combo's and the subtle geek culture references are a blast!  I do have to add that only buy this game if it's on sale for like $4.99 for the base game, not including the DLC.  Not that it isn't worth it, but the game is EXTREMELY buggy.  Me and my friend have had this gave for almost a year and haven't beat the DLC yet, simply because of the bugs.  The base campaign is relatively short, though satisfying, but it took us forever because it's a hassel connecting with a friend to play co-op, and for unexplained reasons the game crashes.  One of these days when we have the mental fortitude to deal with the bugs, we'll finish the DLC, but for now, we have plenty of non buggy games to complete.","November 10, 2013","true","35.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Embracing 8 elements of magic, use your wits and your keyboard to cast powerful spells and brilliant magics. Utilise special combinations of elements to take down your enemies (and your friends). Planning strategies together is just as much of a blast as going against them, in either a campaign of magical destruction, or one of the many challenge rooms available to play. Especially with the amount of DLC available, Magicka is a nearly endless array of fun and hedonism. Truly a clever and hilarious game.

It also has a unique and well thought out combat structure. From the start of the game you are given access to all 8 elements (water, life, shield, cold, fire, earth, arcane, and lighting) which can be combined for various effects. Each element affects the area differently depending on the form and combination.\nif you use it in its direct form (some are spray, earth is projectile, and others are beam) it is mainly a attack. if  you use say, earth + shield, on yourself it creates a body armor. If you use the same combination directly it surrounds you with a rock wall. If you use it as an Area of Effect it causes a small earthquake around your character. And if you enchant your melee weapon with it the weapon will also vary the effect.","July 27, 2012","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Embracing 8 elements of magic, use your wits and your keyboard to cast powerful spells and brilliant magics. Utilise special combinations of elements to take down your enemies (and your friends). Planning strategies together is just as much of a blast as going against them, in either a campaign of magical destruction, or one of the many challenge rooms available to play. Especially with the amount of DLC available, Magicka is a nearly endless array of fun and hedonism. Truly a clever and hilarious game.

The player plays as a wizard from a sacred order where you have to defeat an evil sorcerer who has thrown the world into chaos. The game features a very unique combat system and a storyline full of puns and refrences that cant help but make you smile.\n\nI thought that the game was very entertaining and is one of the best games for "accidently" blowing up your friends in the multiplayer modes. Unfortunatly, it is very easy to get fustrated with a particular level due to the game restarting the level, or from the few and far between checkpoints every time you die.

It's most fun when played with friends. You'll be telling stories about various sessions of this one!! It can take some time to learn the spells but once you do, you can mash them like a pro. One of the other things I really like about this game is all the easter eggs and little details you can find if you're patient and take the time to look. It has all the battle and adrenaline for people who like that too, though. So it's great!","March 8, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dongmechanics/recommended/42910/","dongmechanics","Three Doge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dongmechanics/","191 products in account","This game's pretty straightforward as far as the story goes, but the number of combinations of magicks and the skill required in order to kill the increasingly tougher horde/bosses makes it very fun at times. The fact that you can cross opposite beams to kill enemies when they're healing each other is really cool, as well as the increase in strength proportional to the complexity and number of spells used. Also the idea of using opposites, like casting water on an enemy then using lightning to double the damage done, makes the game really strategic. This game can be REALLY frustrating though. Dying 10 times at the exact same  point in the story because you're outnumbered and there are enemies that are casting OP beams constantly is a little rough. But again, although it seems impossible at times, there is a strategy. Sometimes that strategy is using your own OP beams *cough* lightning bolt *cough* or mines or any other such magick and those may make otherwise difficult and time-consuming bosses or large enemies really easy to kill. After I do that, I'm satisfied that i've finally gotten past a hard point in the story but I don't really have the satisfaction of working for it. I feel like I've cheated, even though it's a valid method of playing. Anyways, it is fun, especially co-op, so you should definitely try it out.","February 17, 2014","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Did the usual scouring the internet for reviews and watching trailers to make sure this would be a good game to buy.  Well, it was well worth the research, this game is fun!  The graphics are rich and colorful, the spell combinations your character can do is crazy fun!  I found the tutorial in the beginning of the game to be quite easy to follow and short.  I've played games where the tutorial just goes on and on and on, not this game.  It took a bit to get used to the controls.  For me, I'm used to using the WSAD keys for all movement and now those are used in some of the spell keys, you point, click and hold the mouse button for your character to move in that direction.  I find the NPC's really funny as the speak a form of "simlish" but in a Norse kind of way.  The only thing i'm not too wild about is that it saves only at checkpoints and for someone like me who just wants to get on and play a quick few minutes at times is kind of inconvenient.  But that's only a minor thing for me!   I definitely recommend this game for those who are into magic filled adventures and want wreak havoc on...anything!

You might as well play TF2 on a pocket calculator.\nWith that out of the way... Think about getting it.\n\nFrom my own point of view, this is one of the best games I have ever had the delight to review. If not the best.\n\nThe combat system is so simple... yet so complex. Its a little like MineCraft in a way, you get given 6 elements (and a melee weapon), but what you do with them is up to you. Should you beam doom upon your foes, rain fire from the sky, or just look at shiny things bounce off other shiny things.\n\nI advise for anyone who tends to not like long games to avoid this, the main "adventure" campaign lasts AT LEAST 2 hours total, but if your not a god, aim for under 12 hours to finish (I sware, when I started this game, it took 12 hours just to defeat each level XD).\nThe game also comes with several "challenges", basically 20 waves of thing hellbent on removing your limbs though your face.\n\nOverall, its worth a try.","February 27, 2012","true","446.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The player assumes the role of a wizard from a sacred order tasked with the ultimate goal of stopping an evil sorcerer who has thrown the world into turmoil, his evil creations besieging the forces of good.\nThe rich, luscious colors somehow make the world a lot more believable than games like Crysis 2 could ever be.\nPeople have complained that Magicka is too complex or confusing, but they're missing the point. It's a game about wielding immense power, but having to be clever to use it properly.\nAnyone who has any interest in cooperative games or action-adventure would do well to pick it up, especially for the almost ridiculous price of $10.\nFresh and fun isometric story-driven monster bash where you can actually improvise and cast spells by combining raw elements instead of mashing numeric keys for canned results.

It also has a unique and well thought out combat structure. From the start of the game you are given access to all 8 elements (water, life, shield, cold, fire, earth, arcane, and lighting) which can be combined for various effects. Each element affects the area differently depending on the form and combination.\nif you use it in its direct form (some are spray, earth is projectile, and others are beam) it is mainly a attack. if  you use say, earth + shield, on yourself it creates a body armor. If you use the same combination directly it surrounds you with a rock wall. If you use it as an Area of Effect it causes a small earthquake around your character. And if you enchant your melee weapon with it the weapon will also vary the effect.","July 27, 2012","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunatly, it is very easy to get fustrated with a particular level due to the game restarting the level, or from the few and far between checkpoints every time you die.

But beware with the friendly magick! It has a funny plot and you have in your arsenal almost unlimited magick as you can cast freely your spells, which makes more fun but also very dangerous, even to yourself.\nIt also has a good amount of replayability as you can solve the same maps in various different ways. Has some dlc to complement your experience and only one of your friends need that to start the dlc campaign, so you don't need to hold back in buying one if your friends won't. It also has a variety of robes with can make your playstyle more unique or just for the lols.

Do you want to slap a goblin with an enchanted ice sword as large as a baby skyscraper? Do you want to melt your friend's face, revive him, and melt his face again? These are just a small sampling of soulful questions that Majicka will pose to you, but perhaps you are a busy man with no time for trivia. Majicka can also make full-fledged statements. Ensconcing enemies in ice and flinging a rock at their vulnerable frozen forms will make it Wizard Christmas. Wizard Christmas is just like regular Christmas except Wizard Christmas snow is sometimes red and the only suitable present for a wizard is cheese.\n\n\n\nSo if you enjoy seeing your enemies driven before you with weeping and gnashing of teeth do not buy this game.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand if you enjoy helping a friend blow up a golem before using your mighty powers, derived from the deepest depths of Arcana to gently push him off a ledge while cackling madly, then buy this game, and buy a copy for your friend. Then find a new friend once he swears eternal vengeance upon you.","February 28, 2015","true","55.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/recommended/42910/","espresso651","Espresso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/","281 products in account","A mage is walking through a village and sees a woman standing outside of her house with an exclamation mark over her head, and approaches her to talk.  She asks him to deal with rats in her basement.  And in that moment, RPG veterans would groan from all of the times they were given the same mindless tasks, and these aren't even cranium rats!\n\nBut of course, there is a twist here.  Everything in this game takes a comedic dump on RPG conventions, lead by a narrator who is totally not a vampire.  What kind of game is this?  It's the kind of game with a Vietnam expansion where you use a M60 on goblins.  Awkwardness of that expansion aside, this is a rather geeky parody of the RPG genre, in the vein of games like Munchkin that find humor in the genre itself.  It's also in Swedish, which gives it an unusual feel.\n\nThe game features a unique magic system, in which eight elements are used in combinations that create spells.  Combining some elements create new elements (such as fire and water making steam), while others cancel each other out.  Learning the combinations that create spells is the key to the game, and it becomes vital to learn to enter them quickly.  While the game can be played with a gamepad, a keyboard and mouse are more effective because they allow faster entry of spells.  Up to four players can play in co-op.","April 5, 2015","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The lack of creative, enjoyable multiplayer games was quite noticable in comparison to the time of Rune, Greebles, Super Maze Wars and other such titles. And then...\nSuddenly, Magicka.\n\nMagicka is the answer to all this. It has a delicious innovatively smooth multiplayer integration and has a combat system that is, whilst less innovative, so creative and creatively stimulating that its smooth, intricate functionality can only be described as organic.\n\nThe overall ambience and atmosphere in Magicka is a chirpy, happy, quirky one. Magicka may very well be the result of all that lacking fun and creativity I mentioned being funneled into one single project, to the extent of the quirkiness and continuous references to other media nearly getting on one's nerves. Nearly.\n\nDefinitely recommended. And *definitely* definitely recommended to play with good friends.","July 26, 2012","true","63.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You need only look at the screenshots above to see how pretty this game is. And thanks to the somewhat unorthodox spell combination system, you can play the game however you want, and be whatever kind of mage you want to be!\n\nMagicka knows exactly what kind of game it wants to be and it delivers that without a hiccup.

Should you beam doom upon your foes, rain fire from the sky, or just look at shiny things bounce off other shiny things.\n\nI advise for anyone who tends to not like long games to avoid this, the main "adventure" campaign lasts AT LEAST 2 hours total, but if your not a god, aim for under 12 hours to finish (I sware, when I started this game, it took 12 hours just to defeat each level XD).\nThe game also comes with several "challenges", basically 20 waves of thing hellbent on removing your limbs though your face.\n\nOverall, its worth a try.","February 27, 2012","true","446.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Agreed, lets become wizards. But for now let me tell you about this game about wizards. In Magicka you play a wizard. You can play with up to but not including 4 of your friends, who will also be wizards whilst you are a wizard. This is because the game only allows a total of 4 wizards on the screen at any point. This programming restriction is one of the least serious flaws this with game, and that's saying something. Wizard.\n\nThe game suffers from a lack of control, gratiuitous amounts of bugs, and non-wizard characters. The problem is that Magicka plays like a weak beat-em up. Wizards run around and beat up non-player non-wizard non-characters, eg: wizard. but instead of fast pased action filled wizard baised action baised fast pased wizard wizard combat, we get something less. The fast placed action does not suit well to the 'plan carefully your wizard rainbow beam +1' style of gameplay. In a word, Not my tea of cup.

The adventure story is well elaborated, humorous, with lots of games/movies references, such as star wars, 300, macgyver, tomb raider, diablo, grim fandango, zelda and many more. The characters speak some sort of mixed languages (swedish, english and some gibberish) which makes it even funnier.\n\nThe magicks (skills) are combinations you can make with the 8 elements given, and even mix these to make other elements. It's possible to create various different magicks as long as the elemental orbs combine. This feature makes the combat style very versatile and unique, besides, in this real-time combat the wizards have infinite mana, use lasers, swords and even guns. And although the wizards have infinite mana, they have other limitations like taking the time to type the combo you want, being slowed by summoning many elemental orbs, the skills duration, and taking care about opposite elements.\n\nAll in all, it's a very entertaining game, cheap, and completely vampire free.\n\n"I put on my robe and my wizard hat."\n\n10/10","July 16, 2014","true","41.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I will list the pros and cons:\nPros: Great spell crafting system. On a keyboard, it's easy to use, and very very fun.\nGreat adventure story.\nGreat difficulty. Some battles require you to think outside the box with what spells you use. I play exclusively two player coop, so it's important to remain dry so that you can res your fellows. Being able to heal quickly and efficiently is a must, as is the courage to spam four or five random element down on the table, and cast it in your immediate vicinity.\nHilarious.\n\nCons: Controller controls not great, especially for spell casting.\nHand starts to cramp on the mouse after about ten minutes of none stop battling.\nA little gory for my taste, even with Blood And Gore turned off.\nThe orcs try to eat your head.\nDungeons And Gargoyles, and Dungeons and Demons DLCs have no ability to save, so you have to finish the dungeon in one long sitting.\n\nOverall, 9/10, best RPG I've ever played, a must buy for anyone who likes playing a game with a lot of FIRE, or any other element they like. Arcane Bombs? Check. Fireballs? Check! Arcane Fireball! CHECK! Icicle Explosion? Tricky, but check. Giant swirling vortex of doom! Yep! Walking Trees? Yep! Instakill Lightning bolts? Oh, yeah!

I found the game to be (mostly) bug-free and quite enjoyable, with the only serious issue being multiplayer is absolutely lacking players and those that do play tend to have agonizingly high ping (European and South American players maybe!?). The single player is a good experience and worth the price of entry, yet entirely too short. Note that ALL of the DLC is for multiplayer, which is basically unpopulated. Shame really. One thumb up, two if there were more people playing multiplayer.\n\nA month later, and I'm still playing this game almost obsessively. The reason: Challenges. SINGLE PLAYER challenges, because multiplayer is still as crappy as it has ever been - i.e. non-existant. Most players / servers have +300 ping and quit all the time. This game needs drop-in play like Mario needs a jump button, but it doesn't have it. The combination of spells and enemies makes the single-player challenges a worthwhile time-waster, so I keep playing. If only the makers would fix multiplayer, this game would be a 10/10 indie game. Otherwise, even as cheap as it is right now (75% off on Steam), it's still only one thumb up and one way, way down. Single player only for the time being, even during the free-to-play weekend.","October 16, 2011","true","109.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Predictably Yellow faffed the spell and did a face-plap after falling some height.\n\nThe magic feels satisfyingly powerful and dangerous (get a spell wrong a few times and you'll see what I mean), and the whole look of the game is perfect (in my opinion). However... this is not a game yet, its a bug that has gameplay in it. While the devs are working to fix all the bugs quickly (on a daily basis), its a shame the game's early days have been marred by bugs that make playing it impossible.\n\nBuy it anyway, and coop it up with me, I'll show you my staff...\n\nonce they fix the coop :D","January 31, 2011","true","99.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

I love the casting system... being able to create a nearly endless combination of spells is very cool and challenging.  In my first session, about an hour in, I dropped a massive magic boulder on my head and died.

The adventure story is well elaborated, humorous, with lots of games/movies references, such as star wars, 300, macgyver, tomb raider, diablo, grim fandango, zelda and many more. The characters speak some sort of mixed languages (swedish, english and some gibberish) which makes it even funnier.\n\nThe magicks (skills) are combinations you can make with the 8 elements given, and even mix these to make other elements. It's possible to create various different magicks as long as the elemental orbs combine. This feature makes the combat style very versatile and unique, besides, in this real-time combat the wizards have infinite mana, use lasers, swords and even guns. And although the wizards have infinite mana, they have other limitations like taking the time to type the combo you want, being slowed by summoning many elemental orbs, the skills duration, and taking care about opposite elements.\n\nAll in all, it's a very entertaining game, cheap, and completely vampire free.\n\n"I put on my robe and my wizard hat."\n\n10/10","July 16, 2014","true","41.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The player plays as a wizard from a sacred order where you have to defeat an evil sorcerer who has thrown the world into chaos. The game features a very unique combat system and a storyline full of puns and refrences that cant help but make you smile.\n\nI thought that the game was very entertaining and is one of the best games for "accidently" blowing up your friends in the multiplayer modes. Unfortunatly, it is very easy to get fustrated with a particular level due to the game restarting the level, or from the few and far between checkpoints every time you die. The controls of the game are also something to get used too.\n\nAll in all, i thought the game was very good and would recomend it to everyone that would like it.","May 7, 2015","true","66.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a short campaign which can be beaten in 2 hours or less if you're goign for a record, but its greatest selling point is the ability to combine up to five 'elements' to create custom made spells to combat each situation.

The real objective of the game is: that you need to defeat the evil with your mighty spells and side-arm.\n\nIn my opinion the game looks like Runescape (in a positive way). Magicka starts with eight spells at the beginning and you’ll get a staff and a sword to wield, there are also another powerful weapons which the creatures could drop or hidden somewhere over the map.\nIn the game there are evil creatures that were made by a powerful wizard, Grimnir. The wizard wanted to spread eternal peace to the world but the order expelled him because of his ambitions. Grimnir was imprisoned at the World’s End.\nMy first time I’ve played Magicka I needed to go into a room below me, but I was just stupid enough that I didn’t read what they asked me to do. So I’ve spent like four minutes of my live to find the damn room. The reason: there was a party that was made for me so I was in a hurry because some guys wanted to eat all the cheese there were all by themselves. I aren’t a great fan of cheese so I didn’t care if they ate it.\n\n\nMy impressions I’ve made so far.\n\nThe game is made with sarcastic jokes, which I didn’t found funny (except one tip: drink not when you drive, is that a tip for a game that has no cars)? I’ve played the game alone until chapter four and I died like eight times, with a few rages. I was proud of myself that I could beat the first chapter. Got pain in my hand, because of spamming casting the spells upon the enemy.\n\nThe Pros and Cons of the game.\n\nPros:\n\n-	The game is fun to play with friends or with people all around the world\n-	The graphics are admirable\n-	The game got trading cards\n-	The developers tried his best to make some jokes, but it didn’t work out somehow\n-	The game got some nice background sounds\n\nCons:\n\n-	The game is hard to play, when you play the game all by yourselves\n-	The voice of the people sounds like they are drunk all the time\n-	Sometimes the screen turns black when you start the game, but you can find an easy fix that will prevent it from  hapening on youtube\n\nI’d say give this game a chance and buy it only if you play the game online with friends or with people all around the world.","May 24","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

English version is written below.\n\nMagicka adalah game aksi dengan mekanisme sihir elemen yang cukup asyik dengan tampilan gameplay yang mirip DotA. Tugasmu dalam game ini cukup simpel, yaitu hancurkan monster-monster dengan kekuatan sihirmu, kalahkan boss, dan selesaikan setiap stage yang ada. Yang paling menarik dari game ini adalah mekanisme magic-nya, di mana kamu dapat menggabung-gabungkan 8 elemen sihir yang ada untuk menciptakan sihir yang kuat sesuai situasi dan selera--simpel sekaligus kompleks. Ditambah mekanisme MP/mana tak terbatas, kamu bisa merasakan menjadi penyihir yang kuat.\n\nCerita Magicka--yang sedari awal sudah konyol, banyak dibumbui parodi ikon pop culture seperti Star Wars, 300, Castlevania, The Hobbit plus bahasa lucu (English+Swedish+gibberish) sehingga menjadikannya semakin konyol lagi.\n\nSangat menyenangkan untuk dimainkan sendiri ataupun multiplayer (biar bisa saling bunuh antar teman). Oh ya, ingat-ingatlah mantra sakti 'QFASA' dan kalau suntuk jangan lupa 'dunka dunka'. Happy gaming!\n\nEnglish Version\n\nMagicka is an action game with interesting elemental magic mechanism, with gameplay which looks similar to DotA. The objective is fairly simple: defeat your enemies with your mighty magick power, defeat the boss and clear the stage. The most interesting thing about this game is its magic casting mechanism where you can combine the 8 magick elements to produce many kinds of spell best suited to the situation and your personal taste. With unlimited MP/mana, you can truly experience what it feels like to be mighty wizard in fantasy RPG setting (with comedic touch).\n\nThe story--which is already funny, is made even funnier with pop culture icon parodies such as Star Wars, 300, Castlevania, The Hobbit, etc. The Simlish-like language (or maybe English+Swedish+Gibberish) is also very funny.\n\nIt's a very fun game to play alone or with friends (so you can kill each other 'accidentally'). Also, never forget QFASA and try to do some 'dunka dunka' whenever you get stressed. Happy gaming!","May 29","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cathedrals/recommended/42910/","cathedrals","cathedrals","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cathedrals/","61 products in account","I love this game. Yes, it's either so resource-intensive or just plain badly optimized that it turns any metal surface on my laptop literally searing to the touch after a few minutes of running, and yes, sometimes the character sounds ("LISNA!") make me want to ("LISNA!") bang my head on the desk ("LISNA!"). But it's weird, inventive, infuriating, and fun.\n\nIt's also a great way to test the strength of your friendships or romantic relationships. Because there is friendly fire, and you will kill your partner with a mis-aimed lightning bolt, and you will accidentally do it five more times in the same battle despite apologizing profusely each time in chat. Don't feel too bad--you'll also probably kill yourself by accident a whole bunch of times too, so it'll all come full circle.\n\nThe combat mechanic maps different elements to keys, creating a huge number of potential unique combos depending on the order, type, and number of each key you manage to mash out. You'll probably settle on a couple of go-to favorites as you learn the combos, but enemies have different elemental weaknesses, which requires you to switch it up from time to time.\n\nYou can play the campaign solo--it gets crazy tough at times, but it's certainly doable and it's very satisfying to beat. But it's built for co-op, which is where it shines. I played it with a good friend and we had a blast despite the many, many, many accidental deaths (mostly caused by me and my stray lightning bolts).\n\nAll in all: this game is a riot.\n\nRating: 5/55: Loved it; 4: Liked it; 3: It's OK; 2: Didn't like it; 1: Hated it","March 9","true","54.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now part of remembering all the combonations at first I was like, "This is going to be a long time until I do that" but I memorized half the spells in as little as no time, because you use them a lot. Also this game is much better with friends than alone, the main story has lots of jokes in it already but when you have 3 other people running around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to cast Lightning Bolt on you or they are trying to cross the beams something always goes horribly wrong and everyone gets a good laugh just to be followed by more fun of the adventure in game, and the DLCs are all fun but my favorite is The Stars Are Left, because it really grasps what H.P.

It supports up to 4 player multiplayer with a adventure, challenge, and versus mode. The way the magic spells work is you have 6 slots to put elements in, and whatever combination you put in is mixed to create a unique spell. There are literally unlimited spell combinations, so there's tons of diversity. There's also books scattered around where you can find these things called Magicks, these are pre-set spells that do special things (some notable ones are summons, vortex, rain/thunderstorm/blizzard, ect). There are also many robes you can select aswell, they have special perks and downsides that make them unique from eachother (like immunity/weakness to some elements). The campaign could last you a good 4-5 hours with added DLC campaigns as well to add on to it. There are A LOT of DLC for this game, mostly PVP maps and robes, these are NOT needed and you should only get them if you feel like you would like those robes/maps or want to support the developer but the campaign DLCs are a must have in my opinion. People say this game is a buggy mess, and it is, but the glitches you may encounter are actually entertaining. The developer have worked hard and patched out most of the game ruining ones, so there's not much to worry about. Get this game, it's worth your money if you have friends to play it with.","January 11, 2015","true","82.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The player assumes the role of a wizard from a sacred order tasked with stopping an evil sorcerer who has thrown the world into turmoil, his foul creations besieging the forces of good. Magicka is a brilliant game made on the 25th January 2011 and i have to say...I LOVE THIS GAME. ONE OF THE BEST GAMES IN MY LIBRARY IF NOT, THE BEST.\nI am not a big fan of RPG games but Magicka has really made me change my mind. This game is superb. Create Spells with your friends .I think Magicka is probably the best mage-game out there. With its amazing sense of satirical humor, Magicka really does bring out out the laughs very often.  The characters voicing and language is the best there is because the way they speak is so humorous, just like the minions in despicable me.\n\nPros:\n- Fun game that you can play with friends.\n- Allows you to do spells that the students of hogwarts can't do.\n- Characters Voicing is very funny.\n\nCons:\n- Co-op (Multiplayer) needs to be fixed.\n\nAll in all this is a fabulous game which i would definitely recommend to my friends. 10/10\n","January 21, 2014","true","8.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
