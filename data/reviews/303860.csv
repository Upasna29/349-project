That being said the missions have good dialogue with each mission following on from the last. however start of fairly short. along side this the AI here tends to be fairly restricted at least on the 1st 6-7 missions leaving you to do most the attacking, and stomping them\n\nSkirmishes\nyou and upto 3 AI\nLike most War Strategy games this (and multiplayer) is where you will spend most of your game time. It features a nice suite of options including muliple landscapes eg, islands and climents (just for a change of scenery), and a  handful of "popular" game modes,\n\nMultiplayer\nwith the nice background of units, the multiplayer is failry equal, you have lots of statergys to use against your human opponent/s and spamming one type of unit might work, but can very quickly be countered. it doesnt support ui, meaning you cant have you and a mate battling too "robotic" ai. you have to face off another human team alone. you also cannot set it up as a private game, meaning if you want your friend you should time it, so no one else jumps in and steals his place(granted its a bit quite at the moment)\n\nOptions\nmost the normal options here, sound controls ect, resoluctions (upto 1080) and the ability to adjust particles (quality of the wepon's fire)\none of the negative aspects is the save option, it works but you can only save one game (although it seems Campaign save and Skirmish save is separate, but it mean you can only play one Skirmish at a time, and not bounce around between several, or have a backup save incase it gets corrupted (i personaly like to make a save at the very start as a map backup, incase i realy enjoy that map and want to use it again, but in another way)\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThis game plays somewhat like Supream Commander (1), if you have played that and enjoyed it, you will enjoy this game, it might not be a grand or as pretty but its a very good spitual successor to it with plenty to keep you busy\npros:\nLarge amount of units to choose from\nLarge scale war, who likes mothering over 20-30 units, you trained them to die,they will die\nGood selection of countrys to pick from, not just the old fashion USA/Russia/China choice (although the campain Revolves around these)\n\nMultiple resolutions (most of them are common ones such as 1080)\n\nEasy to use UI, if you have played a staregy game before you will generally feel at home\n\nKeybindings (kinda)\n\nPlenty of map choice (eg continates/sea/ islands ect)\n\nCons:\nMost of the keybindings are your control groups or open the map, you cant set keybindings to build buildings or train units\n\nNo repeat queue order\n\nMini map is in a odd place and cant be moved\n\nDefault options have the unit cap at 1000, im assuming this might be the top end cap for phones, and pc's can go higher without a high fps drop (upto 5000 units)\n\nShadows seem to be a dark green which just looks odd when your near a forest\n\nLow Res Grahics (commonly called charming or retro)\n\nOnly one Save slot (One for Campain, One for Skirmish)\n\nNo Private mode or AI in Multiplayer\n\nSteam Overlay doesnt work","July 23, 2014","true","7.2"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","35","40","3","0"

It seems simple at first, but it can be very in depth with choosing your reserach and deciding what type of army to build. The tactical map is probably my favorite part, as I have longed for a map that in depth (with grids, unit locations, forces, ect) and tracked the warfare live. You can zoom out, get some good SA on the battlefield, and then zoom in where you want back to the normal game.\n\nBalance is very well rounded, no massing one type of unit with no counter, every unit in this game, while seemingly OP, has a good counter, so no BS wins.\n\nDefinitly worth the purchase, I got the 4 pack and me and my buddies play it every night, a good break from the monotony of the other games we play.","November 23, 2014","true","20.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","0"

Enjoyable base building - not quite as extensive as the castle/wall building in Battle for Middle Earth 2, but you do get a sense of "home base" that is sometimes missing in other RTS, or is too artificial in games like COH where you are limited in the scope of your base building. And you can create sprawling bases, or have satellite stations with defense structures to help maintain control of areas. There's a good selection of defense structures and weapons, as well as various ground, air and naval units.\n\nGraphics are 2D, but don't let that fool you, there's plenty of gameplay under the hood. You can also stack buildings, for example undersea energy generators beneath floating air defense platforms.\n\nIn addition to Tech Levels, there are specific research enablers across Air, Land and Sea - for offensive and defensive units. Additional map features (e.g. magma flows) add strategic resources that can be fought over.\n\nEconomy plays a secondary role - you don't need to micromanage your economy, but you will need to maintain ore and energy reserves to build units and advance technology levels. Base building is important, as defensive buildings have limited range, so as your base expands, you'll need to build outer layers of defenses.\n\nSome really memorial battles - across Air, Land and Sea (underwater too). Lots of good tech advancements. Oh, and you can pretty much play as any country - Ireland for World Domination (TM) :)\n\nThe UI is not perfect, but nor does it get in the way. And there's nice single-click options to scout unchartered territory, so you spend less time uncovering the map and more time building your empire and expanding your war machine.\n\nPlenty of game options to start at different tech levels, starting resources, mutators etc.\n\nAnd an indie developer that cares about customers.\n\nI've not tried it multiplayer, but single player campaign and especially skirmish is extremely good fun.\n\nBuy it if you like Supreme Commander, BFME2, Company of Heroes etc. Or buy it if you want a fun game that can easily absorb hours at a time on a mammoth battle.","July 25, 2014","true","4.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

The art is good, the sound is decent and the game keeps your attention. However; when you play in skirmish, the AI seems to pop up EVERYWHERE. Even in your base. Not to mention that, when you seem get rid of them, they'll sometimes spawn in the same spot no more then a second later. Other then that, there are a few bugs here and there but it's still very much worth the money.","September 30, 2014","true","6.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Digital_Nik/recommended/303860/","Digital_Nik","DigitalNik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Digital_Nik/","72 products in account","This game is pretty good, definitely a step up from the old Land Air Sea Warfare game.\n\nI actually started playing LASW when it was first released for IOS. I actually helped James at Isotope 244 with some ideas for the game on Facebook. If I remember correctly, 3 or 4 people pitched ideas on the Isotope 244 Facebook page. My suggestion was a nuclear power plant mega unit that blows up when destroyed. Good call not including that James, it was a bad idea.\n\nCompared with LASW I feel like Machines at War 3 is just a big update. Graphics are the same, units are a tiny bit different, and the AI is a little more aggressive but no necessarily better. However, Machines at War is a game in its own, so I'll treat it as a new game for this review.\n\nGraphics / Gameplay: 2D icon type graphics with some cool particle effects and decent physics. The graphics work well for the RTS genre, but the grid system is where the game really shines. Being able to zoom out and look at the map in the form of a giant graph is mad cool. It makes me feel like I'm some cold war commander controlling robots from a underground bunker somewhere.\n\nI also love the stats that pop up at the end of the battles. Its super cool being able to break down your strategy into the raw stats and numbers.\n\nMusic: The soundtrack is OK / Bad. The real problem is trying to play your own music instead. I'll cover this later\n\nAI: The AI is a huge part of any RTS, and this one does pretty good.\n\nBack in LASW the AI had OK strategy and terrible tactics. In Machines at War 3 the AI has become very aggressive strategically, but not much smarter tactically.\n\nStrategy: The AI knows that the key to success is mega units and Ore. So it conducts search and destroy missions for the special resources from the start of the game. Once it has the resources, the AI is able to out produce you, and overwhelm you with massive amounts of building, units, and mega units.\n\nIf you don't get a leg up on the AI by getting some special resources in the early game, you're on the defensive for the rest of the game for sure.\n\nTactics: The AI is still lacking a bit on the tactics side. The AI tries to overwhelm you with massive amounts of units, and it really isn't that effective against a human player who can set up decent defenses. One thing that I noticed was that the AI only attacks with one kind of unit at a time. The AI will launch an air attack, and then a land attack, and then a sea attack, waiting in-between to rebuild more units.\n\nA human player easily defeats the AI in tactics because we know that you're supposed to attack with air, sea, and land at the same time. No point in sending in tanks if a helicopter will destroy them. No point in sending helicopter if a fighter will shoot it down. No point in sending a helicopter, tank, or fighter if a gunboat or submarine is covering the river. The AI does not understand this, and sends units into areas where they cannot help or get slaughtered.\n\nIn addition, I just have to mention how horrible the AI is with building facilities. Why the hell would you rebuild your mother base next to mine? How does it make sense to build a factory within shooting distance of my factory? The AI is just too aggressive with building factories and buildings, and it ends up just being a waste of resources that the AI hoards.\n\nOther: I have to mention that this game has troubles on Mac. You cannot go into big picture mode while this game is running. You have to save and quit if you want to do ANYTHING ELSE while the game is running. Want to play music through iTunes? Better not want to change a song, you have to save and quit. Why is this still a thing Isotope 244?\n\nRating: Overall, I think Machines at War 3 is pretty good. I don't think it is worth $14.99 though. I would suggest this game to my friends, and I think that its great that Isotope 244 still makes RTS games even after they have fallen out of style all over the Mac /  PC space. In addition, it is great to support an indie dev.\n\nI'm also really glad this game was released on steam. No offense James, but your website made me afraid to buy your game for a long time.","April 10, 2015","true","14.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I was initially introduced to Isotope 244 when I played Land Air Sea Warfare on my iPod Touch. I loved the game and decided to get Machines at War 3, which is very much like it. Machines at War 3 is a strategy game that takes place on land, in the sea, and in the air, and this combination creates some intense matches. The maps can be small or big depending on your preference, and there are a variety of maps and terrain. There are tons of units that you can manufacture to fight the enemy(s). There are tons of buildings, walls, and defenses you can make, so you basically create little (or big) bases that defend themselves and attack other bases. It is pretty awesome, especially since you can make missles and mega-units to finish off your opponents. Units are performance-friendly so you can easily have hundreds of units on the battlefield at once. It also has somewhat good music. It is a really fun game and has a ton of replay value, so it is worth buying ;)","July 26, 2014","true","5.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","2"

Hundreds of units, unlimited terrain, extreme customization of settings, and comes with multiplayer, a campaign and skirmish capabilities. WOW.\n\nI found this game way way way back--when LASW was on the Apple itunes store. It exceeded my expectations.\n\nNow that Machines at War has entered Steam I can't wait to see it explode into the community...\n\nPros:\n\nUnits: Tons of units--all unique and very balance. There is always a way to counter a unit. But with a diverse army it can be much harder even though it may cost more resources and time to get a diverse army. There are about four tiers of units: wimpy, base units, strong units, and mega units. I won't spoil anything but when you get your hands on a mega unit it just gets your heart pumping! Plus they are also very diverse and balanced!\n\nSettings: If you want only infantry, you got it. Sick of nukes? disable them. Need a challenge? play against robotic. You are in control of how the game is played. Plus the maps are randomly generated... with different land types (lava, sand, forest etc.). Really... you can make the envirnment the way you want!\n\nCalm: Most RTS games are gogogogogogo. Starcraft for example, love it, live it, breath it, but it is a very stressful game! MAW3 brings a competitive atmosphere with an easy to understand and comfortable gameplay. Going a long with the balance of the game, there is so many options that even if your opponent is being aggressive you can counter it with defense. If your opponent is turtling, save up for some nukes and upgrades. If your opponent seems to be spending a lot on powerful units counter with multiple attacks of smaller units from multiple areas. It is an easy envirornment to get good and have fun but without the frustration (most of the time).\n\nCons:\n\nResource Management: This is a struggle in this game. The only resource management involved is time, power and credits (not sure of the technical term in this perticular game). The thing is, the credits are made automatically and you are given 50 (to start out with) per second i believe. Yes, this is an easy way to make sure the game is balance but it takes away from another strategic point that can be pressured. The only thing the enemy can do you negatively inpact your "economy" is by destroying power. Now... you can increase the amount of credits you earn per second by capturing rare minerals on the map and upgrading your headquaters. Still... I wish there was another smaller building that would allow you to get maybe five extra credits per second so there could be a micro economy.\n\nMultiplayer: Hopefully with MAW3 entering the Steam arena will help with this but there is almost no multiplayer lobbies at all. On the mobile devices you can randomly search for people and you MIGHT get someone. Here its almost always 0 servers 1 player online (that player is you).\n\nControls: For the most part navigation and understanding where things are is very easy to understand. But the lake of superb unit control and hot keys hurts this game. *This in no way is a game breaker* some units are small and cannot be targeted very well (infantry---- one of the reasons their affective) some units will keep moving towards the engaged unit, sometimes losing its range advantage and therefore nullifying the reason for range advantage at some points, and the mouse dragging affect with the four headed arrow ca be extremely annoying. Maybe an option to toggle on and off?\n\n\nAll in all..... EPIC. And all done by ONE GUY. So good. Buy it. Love it.\n\nOh and the graphics.................... honestly. Some of the best games were created on the Gameboy Advance, Playstation, and Atari.... Graphics can make a game look beautiful but in no way (in my opinion) will make a game successful. Poop graphics, excellent mechanics= Good game. Excellent graphics, poop mechanics= poor game... It is not a Mobile port rip off... the PC version was created first LOL!\n\n5/5 Keep it up James...","July 24, 2014","true","19.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","7","10","3","0"

What is particularly nice about the design is the way base construction is handled  - buildings can be pretty much placed anywhere with a few reasonable restrictions. This method allows for rapid expansion in many directions and forces the player to fight on multiple fronts. The AI will expand constantly and smartly thus keeping you on your toes at all times.\n\nWhat separates this game from similar ones like Command & Conquer, Supreme Commander, Starcraft, etc. is the speed of expansion and conflict. You are thrust into a wild and crazy combat situation in no time. The straight forward but very appealing 2D presentation (with various levels of zoom) allow for thousands of units to move and engage each other at a furious pace.\n\nPerhaps one weakness is that there is only a single faction available which results in the player and AI using the same units, technologies, and strategies to win but that is a minor gripe. But there is also an advantage to this setup in that everyone is on an equal footing.\n\nAs with any game, there is room for improvement (such as: giving infantry an entrenchment capability, allowing infantry to occupy certain buildings like outposts, enhance the AI so that it uses walls to defend its bases in skirmish mode, and perhaps add mountainous terrain,) but as it stands now the game is very exhilarating.\n\nOverall, a very impressive and fun game especially when you consider it was programmed by one person.","August 2, 2014","true","9.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Surprisingly a lot of depth, it's a 2D RTS which is fine, you don't notice once you got your head in the game. The easy setting is crazy easy with the exception of one or two missions. Might give the MP a go soon. For the price a nice little indie title. I'll probably have completed this soon, in the absence of any good market leading RTS games this little puppy fills the gap.","July 27, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

On a larger scale than some rts games, but not huge (Unlike SupCom or Planetary annihilation) which means you won't have much trouble managing your troops. Good selection of units that aren't boring. The graphics and animations aren't great, but i don't give a crap about that and considering the large amount of content having low graphics barely makes a difference. Worth the $15 and definetly buy it if it's on sale.","July 23, 2014","true","2.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrskarvoey/recommended/303860/","mrskarvoey","Maknoz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrskarvoey/","810 products in account","First off; I've been playing this game much more than my playtime on Steam (played the standalone version until now).\n\nThis RTS lays close to my heart. I've been playing all the iterations (Machines at War and Land Air Sea Warfare), and I've been loving every one of them. It's by far the most pure RTS experience I've been able to get my hands on. It's not to complex to get into, yet has the depth that keeps me interested. Every playthrough can be different - depending on whatever strategy you choose - through a reasonable amount of units (of all types, land, air, sea, sub, mega units) and quite a good variety of research options. The research options can be a generic +25% damage or sight, or a more game changing one that unlocks end-game units.\n\nAlthough I mostly enjoy the multiplayer and skirmish gamemodes, I find the campaign completly satisfactory. The story in itself is nothing to write home about, but that's not what this game is about. The campaign is not just a quick skirmish with increased difficulty, but rather a new experience that requires you to do different set of missions. They're fun and absolutely worth the value of this game!\n\nBut the great fun in this game, for me, is the skirmish. I've been playing with my little brother and we're having a lot of fun. It's fast paced and usually a race to the Black Widows... because they're annoying as hell if you're not prepared for them. ;-)\n\nThe units are both unique and some of them "classic", as you'd expect. I love the mega units altough they can be quite hard to acheive on a multiplayer game, but that's all about the strategy. Nukes are the even more fun, and frustrating for your opponent of course. But all the über-units in this game has a opponent unit or defensive building, so this game is not unfair by any measure. I especially love the "wasp" type air units as they're cheap, effective and a nuance for the opponent.\n\nAll in all; I really recommend this game. A great, waterproof RTS with a great value.","August 11, 2014","true","8.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Why am I playing this? Unless you are somehow stuck in the mid 90's play something else - anything else, or mop the kitchen floor - yeah mopping the kitchen floor would definately be more enjoyable.\n\n--------------------\n\nThe interface is quite terrible.  I'm playing at 2560x1600 and the menu structure is tiny on the right side of the screen.  The individual units are tiny, the animations sorely lacking, there's no Warcraft or Command and Conquer charm in the voice acting.  The music is weird, like some recycled MIDI version of Robin Hood Prince of Theives cinema music. The game keeps popping up a message saying if the units are too small - then I should lower my resolution...(I don't want to lower my resolution).  The interface is sooo unitunitive I can't even find anything in the tutorial, where is the dang thing I need to progress teh turorial!!!! ahhhhh get me out of here!...\n\nAfter the 30 minute tutorial I uninstalled and wrote this bad review.   In 2016 we have RTS games like Warhammer 40,000, Company of Herores 2, etc.  Compared to those games, this is like something made for Windows 3.1.    I wish the lack of modern graphics, great sound, usuable interfaces, and zilch charm were forgivable, but with Triple A titles all over the place on Steam for $5 on a sale any given day of the week--- I just think you'd have to be Haaaaaaard up, or friends with the developer to want to play this title.","April 24","false","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
