"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/361950/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","MOAI 2: Path to Another World is the most recent entry in the enjoyable time management series by Alawar Entertainment.  Not only is it a continuation of the story from the first, but includes many unique additions and improvements in game play that sets it as a worthy successor to the original.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=482839336\nGame play is generally the same consisting of multi-tasking activities as efficiently as possible while managing resources to complete specific tasks (build, gather, etc.) in an effort to beat the clock, but with the addition of the ability to store power-ups for use at your leisure.  This small quality-of-life change makes a HUGE difference when you're trying to effectively strategize your actions.  Each level now also has a second, harder version with completely different objectives and alternate strategies to complete them.  This essentially doubles the amount of content in the game and encourages approaching each level in several different ways.  Really cool change.  You also have the ability to find and unlock (via achievements) artifacts that your character can equip to give him special bonuses.  This alone adds quite a bit of strategy to the game play as you customize bonuses to your own preference and swap them out depending on the requirements for each level.  Toss in the addition of an Easy/Expert level toggle, and the game now covers both casual and "hardcore" tastes.\n\nThe sequel offers the same high quality artwork and music with the only change being the removal of voiced narration during the interlude scenes.  While the absence is noticeable for those who've played the first, it doesn't affect the game much at all.  Oh, and we have female natives now! No longer is Bright Light the only woman on the entire island. YAY!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=483284787\nI normally do not gush this much over sequels, but MOAI 2 is a true improvement over the first in every way, and I LOVED the original.  With full Steam integration including trading cards, and especially achievements, there's absolutely no reason to not have this game in your library if you are a fan of time management titles.  MOAI 2 is up there with 12 Labours of Hercules as one of the best of its kind, and that's a huge compliment.  If you loved MOAI: Build Your Dream, then you will absolutely enjoy MOAI 2.  Even if you haven't played the first, or any time management game for that matter, this is a great introduction to the genre.\n\nBottom Line: Highly recommended for fans of time management games as well as those looking to try their hand at a more than solid entry in the genre.\n\nNote - This game was provided by the publisher with the request to write an informative review. No other consideration, compensation or instruction was received.","July 17, 2015","true","31.4"," 72 of 77 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","72","77","4","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048574801/recommended/361950/","76561198048574801","tomahawkza","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048574801/","655 products in account","MOAI 2: Path to Another World is the successor to Moai: Build Your Dream (from Buka entertainment who also publish Promised Land, Rescue 1 and a slew of other family friendly games).  MOAI 2: Path to Another World is yet another delightful casual game featuring this publisher's trademark cutesy art style and family friendly content. Moai 2 is almost Identical in many respects to Moai: Build Your Dream.  Both MOAI games sport very similar game play to Promised Land, but are slightly less complex but more demanding on reflexes and quick puzzle solving.\n\nThe game runs in 1920 x 1080p full HD in full screen mode. The art style is cute and would be at home in any children's story book. The sounds are cute and atmospheric and the music is pleasant easy listening and unobtrusive.\n\nGame play is smooth and intuitive with helpful tool tips and a quest status tracker on the lower right of the screen.\n\nThe interface is well laid out and uncluttered. Stages are well designed and start out simple progressing in complexity as the player gets deeper into the game.\n\nBefore each stage there is a scenario-setting dialogue providing a story driven element. Between stages there are storyboard pictures with story text.  Sadly MOAI 2 does not have the superb Voice Overs for the dialogue that the original title had.\n\nMoai 2 picks up where the previous game left off.  Unfortunately the peace is broken when the Chief's daughter is kidnapped.  The player is then tasked to guide the hero through many scenarios and will meet many characters and challenges along the way.  MOAI 2 is larger than the original game in game content and could take about 40 hours or more to complete and does have replay value.\n\nCompleting quests before the timer runs out will earn the player gold status for that level. Fortunately players can select to re-play any previously completed level via an easy to use map which tracks game progress. Games are automatically saved for each registered player and can be resumed at any time.\n\nMOAI 2: Path to Another World is only 300Mb in size and will not hog valuable hard drive space. The game is fun to play and will provide several hours of enjoyment. MOAI 2 will appeal to casual gamers of all ages and is especially suitable as a family game for younger children. Children unable to read will need adult assistance as there is a need to read mission text.\n\nPlayers familiar with the first game will feel right at home in MOAI 2 as the gameplay mechanics are identical and many of the original characters are featured in this new installment.  It is however not a requirement to have played (or completed) the first game to play MOAI 2, but it would be a good idea for story continuity.\n\nOverall this is a great budget game, offering family friendly casual gaming and will provide lots of fun and enjoyment. Those looking for something similar with more complexity should look at Promised Land.\n\nRating 8 / 10","July 17, 2015","true","13.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Also, you have now a backpack available to you where you can store artifacts you collect along the way.  These artifacts have different properties attached to them. To give you an example, the agronomistâ€™s book will increase the amount of food fields by 15% which is very handy if you need to produce a large amount of this type of resource. In total you can gather 24 artifacts but can only place 7 on your character, so choose them wisely. The right combination could help you beat the level in time and hit the gold!\n\nAnother aspect that I really like in this game is the additional mission per level. Actually you have level 1 and level 1a. The level a will give you another goal to reach and slightly change the layout of the map (obstacles, villains like the thief and others) which increase the difficulty. After 6 hours of playing I only managed to finish level 13 and 13a gold. That gives you an idea of how long and challenging this game is.\n\nThe story-line is good and you will be treated with nice artworks throughout the game.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Well-structured strategy and management game\n-	Stacks of Levels\n-	HD graphics\n-	Achievements\n-	Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Please give us more time per levels. Lol\n\nA very good casual game for any age! A good one to have in your library.\n\n8.9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/361950/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","Casual, fun and easy going; this game is a great time waster.\n\nYou can play with more of a challenge or at a more relaxed pace depending on your mood. Each level, while offering a lot of the same tasks each time, tasks your brain on finding the best way to complete the mission each level. I found myself restarting a few levels when I realized there were better ways to go about tackling them. Better time means a better score so finding an efficient way of solving the puzzles is key.\n\nAside from the game play aspect there is a story. You play a hero who is on a mission to save their beloved from evil and along the way you help other lands effected by this dark cloud. The characters you meet are all affected by the evil in different ways and offer companionship on your journey.\n\nOverall it's a nice casual strategy game that I recommend buying.","August 3, 2015","true","3.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

It really isn't much different from the first one apart from improved grafics and a few more options in how you customize your gameplay by picking up artifacts that give different boni. It's not very hard, even the alternate levels can easily be don on gold level. A good casual game to unwind.\n\nIt's not really worth the asking price, but if you can grab it on a sale it's fine.\n\nWarning: One achievement appears to be broken so if you are looking 100% don't get it.","December 7, 2015","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
