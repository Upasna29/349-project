TL;DR at bottom\n\nFirst off, I got a 90% coupon on a 99c game, so there was very little risk. The problem is that I thought I was buying a game. This ultimately would be considered a project for your high school game programming class. It's something you'd expect to find on your buddy's twitter page or an indie game marketing group.\n\nDevil's Share is full of glitches, where they should have at least been compensated with an actual story. You start off in the middle of an abandon gas station, and immediatly are able to find youself a flashlight, gun, and some keys to move onto the next area.\n\nThe next area has butt-♥♥♥♥ ton of cute little glowing zombies in an idle pose lingering around in a grid like formation around the city. Easy enough, you are able to pop off at least 10 zombies before entering the house to explore. While you are exploring the house for as little as 20 seconds, you will find yourself at the title sceen. Not because the game sucks, but because you have died because the zombies will RESPAWN and clip right through the structure and kill you from the bottom floor.\n\nand with this issue in mind, it is incredibly hard to progress through game as there are no health packs, and the zombies will chase you if you are behind their spawning point.\n\nIt is not confirmed as to whether there is an end to this game as it has no story apart from looting tasks, and the last structure is only 4 building away from the start of the game. I would like to point out that if these structures have stairs, you will have a hell of a time getting in. Its like that part in Far Cry 3 where youre unable to get into the gun store at the beginning.\n\nLets focus on the graphics real quick. We've already established that it has no story, so something good must be in Devil's Share, right? Well, kinda. I'm not certain where all of the models were obtained from, but if the developer modeled them all by his/herself, then hats off to him/her. Even if all of the structures we're extremely overused. But it takes a little more than great models to wow me. They need to be textured correctly.\n\nThe dev used Unity3D, so you can basically assume that everything is going to have that crazy, high octane specularity and wild bump mapping that every Unity game seems to carry around with them. It looks like everything is covered in water, but it's not raining in the game.\n*as a side note, you can clip though 40% of the walls and building, but at least you cant escape the map, and the game that comes with it\n\nI can go on and discuss more things, but this review is already too long for my taste, so Im gonna just leave it at:\n\nTL;DR: Unless youre a developer looking at what not to do when making a game, it's not worth the 10 cents you shell out for it\nThanks for reading!","September 12, 2015","false","0.2"," 98 of 105 people (93%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","93","98","105","15","1"

Ain't much else to say about it.\n\nOn the bright side, here's a recipe for a fish fingers and custard from Doctor Who (recipe by Feast of Fiction):\n\n\nFish Fingers and Custard\n\nFish Fingers:\n1-2lbs of cod or any other light fish\n1 cup of flour\n1-2 eggs (1 egg for 1 lb of fish, 2 eggs for 2 lbs)\n1 cup of seasoned bread crumbs\n1/4 cup of shredded parmesan cheese\nSalt and pepper (to taste)\nVegetable oil\n\nCustard\n4 egg yolks\n1/2 cup of sugar\n1 tbsp white flour\n2 cups of milk\n1/2 tsp vanilla extract\nLemon zest (grated rind of 1/2 to 1 lemon)\n\nFish Fingers: cut your fish into fish finger sized chunks. The thicker they are, the easier they will be to cook. The width and length should be around the size of two fingers held together. Once you've cut up your fish, create an assembly line starting with your flour, then your beaten egg(s), then your seasoned bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. You can add salt and pepper to taste in your eggs.\n\nDip the fish fingers into the flour just covering the surface. Knock off an extra flour. Immerse the entire finger into the beaten eggs. Knock off any extra eggs that hang on. Roll the finger in the bread crumbs and cheese until all the surfaces are equally covered. Again, knock off any extra crumbs or cheese that stick to the surface.\n\nPrepare a medium or large non-stick skillet or pan and add a layer of vegetable oil the bottom. You'll want the oil to be deep enough to go a quarter of the ways up the fish finger when you put them in to cook.\n\nHeat the oil on medium high. Once it's sufficiently hot, carefully place your fish fingers around the pan. Some oil may jump out at you, so don't splash your fish fingers in when placing them or you'll end up with some painful burns. After about 2-3 minutes (depending on the heat), your fish fingers will brown. Flip the cooked side over and cook the remainder of the fish finger until all sides have been browned.\n\nTake the fish fingers off the stove and place them on a napkin or paper towel to soak up any extra oil.\n\nCustard: Combine the egg yolks and sugar in a medium saucepan. Stir until combined. Add in the flour and stir until combined.\n\nIn a separate saucepan, add the milk, vanilla extract, and lemon zest. Heat until the milk mixture begins to boil. Remove from heat and slowly add to egg yolk and sugar/flour mixture while stirring constantly.\n\nOnce the two have combined, place on low heat and simmer, stirring often until the mixture takes on a custard like consistency.\n\n\nHopefully your fish fingers will taste better than this game. Warm excrement would taste better than this game.\n","August 5, 2015","false","0.4"," 139 of 172 people (81%) found this review helpful 134 people found this review funny","81","139","172","134","2"

I guess I'll find out when I finish writing the review. Devil's share is a game that would have thrived on places like Newgrounds or Kongregate. Its got it all. FPS action, Cool graphics, and good story telling... IF IT WAS A NEWGROUNDS GAME. I honestly don't know how games like this get passed through Greenlight. Do people just pass them to see them get funny Lets Plays? Or do some gamers have a craving for uninspired flops? Either way, I despise, yet thank those people. Devils Share is an attempt at creating horror FPS game where the point is to get to the end of the Road(literally, the game walking along the road until you get to the end).\n\nStory: NONE!\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe Goal of this game is to go from area to area finding stuff to get to other areas. This gets Extremely tedious because all the game tells you to do is:\n\n1: Go get the keys\n2: Open the locked door\n3: Go get that new gun\n4: Go to the next area\n\nRepeat that 5 more times, and you win.\nSounds Easy right? WRONG. There are these weird Demon things chasing you around that sneak behind you and attack you. They aren't scary but VERY FRUSTRATING. As far as I've seen, there is no way to regenerate your health. No health packs, no bandages, no natural regen, nothing. You start at 200% health at the beginning and each time you get damaged it takes away 10% health(Why start with 200%? Just start at 100% and take 5% damage instead. It makes more sense). Not to bad right? Well this wouldn't be if it werent for the fact that they Constantly Spawn and they can trap you and do constant damage. And death puts you back to the beginning. It doesn't remove your quest progress, but it makes it so you have to backtrack all the way back where you were, and by then you've taken so much damage you are at 10% health. As I mentioned before there are guns that can kill the demons, If you have ammo for that gun, you can easily fight off the demons with one shot per demon. However, there is almost NO AMMO ANYWHERE. But, if you don't have any ammo its okay, because you can beat the demons with your flashlight, if you could actually FIND YOUR FLASHLIGHT IN YOUR INVENTORY. The wonky control system makes it so E switches weapons. Lets say you are out of ammo, and have to get your flashlight to fight the demons. You try the scroll wheel like in other FPS games. Nothing. Okay, you try the 1,2,3,4,etc buttons. Nothing. So you quit the games and have to look at the main menu that has all the controls on it. Time to get back to where you were. Still out of ammo, so you press E a bunch of times and you accidentally pass the flashlight. You now have to go back around again, while the demons are still hurting you, and when you find the flashlight, you die. And you keep the same ammount of ammo when you die, so there are 50 demons around you and you have nothing but your flashlight to beat them with. And this is about where I quit. I'm done.\n\nHowever, for 25 cents, its worth it. Even though with all the flaws this game has, it is pretty funny to play, and its 25 cents. You could probably scrap up the money for this by selling a few trading cards, so you could get it for free. I sent this to a few friends and their reactions are pretty funny. So do I recommend this as a game? NO. Do I recommend this as a something to laugh at? Absolutely.\n\n\n\n\n\nWAIT A MINUTE. As most of you figured out already, this game is developed in unity. I've used unity myself and I thought all the assets for the game were made from scratch. That is why i defended it at the end.  BUT as Unity developers know you can buy or download assets from the unity asset store with 0 effort.\n\nhttps://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/20736\nhttps://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/2943\nhttps://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/39110\n\nWHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY\n\nTHIS GAME IS A MONSTROSITY.

WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU I CANT BELIEVE YOU DID THIS TO ME HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?\n\nExcuse me, I am going to buy the assets for this game and go make an exact copy of it, with the name DEVILS BEAR, and it'll probably make so much money.","August 2, 2015","false","1.0"," 70 of 78 people (90%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","90","70","78","18","0"

This statement might be far-fetched considering this is based on only the library of software I have but for some reason I do believe finding a more undeveloped, unfinished game among the rest of the games on Steam would be a challenge.\n\nOn a side note, I would like to mention that I do not appreciate that the creators filed a lawsuit against somebody who did a very negative video review of this product - although it was done in a somewhat PewDiePie fashion (i.e. with the abundance of yelling and pretty harsh words), I still believe this is way out of line especially if you are a software developer.\n\nI'll just list the number of items I did not like in Devils Share:\n\n--- no explanation of the story whatsoever; we do not know why we are dropped in the middle of a small town and why we do the tasks that we are required to do\n--- I know for horror games dark environments are a must but this game redefines the expression pitch black - even with the flashligh it is a struggle to make out your surroundings\n--- except for the enemies - these demons have vivid red colours and immediately attack you once you get close to them\n--- horrible animations - enemies do not move just float and slowly get closer to you; the attack animation is only visible after you get hurt\n--- horrible soundtrack - you hear the same, continuous "music" that gets irritating very early on\n--- regular clipping - if you can't open a door, don't worry, you might just find yourself going / jumping through that without any effort\n--- bad layout of buildings, badly inserted / connected objects, game assets (you can see outside in between two adjacent walls)\n--- simplistic, ugly main menu with barely any options available\n\nThe list goes on, but I believe there's no need to further elaborate. Oh, and for those claiming it is only 0,99 EUR - sorry, but it's like saying I have to uprate / recommend every title if it is free. Many also complain that the game uses Unity assets that are easily found / downloaded from the internet - this is not necessarily a problem if at least some effort is put into creating a game.\n\nThis is an example of how you must not approach video game development. It is also a shame that the developer's library of games consists of mainly bad products. Do steer away from Devils Share if you can!","April 2","false","5.4"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","40","42","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrDesu/recommended/388870/","MrDesu","ｄｅｓｔ.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrDesu/","629 products in account","Devils Share is a poor excuse of a game, and even at the low price it is, does not deserve the space it has on Steam. This game can be completed in under 2 minutes if you know what you're doing.\n\nIt's shorthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxXOEKtzn8I\nI understand it's really cheap, but this is no excuse.\n\nIt's uglyThere are people who are trying to tell me that this game "looks good" or "runs well." Unity is an engine that is designed to run well on all sorts of system so that it's accessible to developers and so that their creations can run on their customers system. I understand this and can fogive it when the game is actually decent. However, here, the map is literally just a purchased asset with some lighting changes.\nhttps://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/20736\nSure, those are great ways to learn but these shouldn't be allowed to be marketed on Steam.\n\nThe story Outside of the ending blurb, you're not told the story unless you read the story that's provided on the Steam Store page. None of it is told in game. Couldn't be arsed to even do that much?\n\nSoundI've heard every sound in this game before in some form of media many times, there's no orginality.\n\nAIThere is no intellegence to the AI. It's all bound to incredibly strict rules. By being within a certain range of an enemy, they will begin to head towards you and attack. They do have an attack animation, but they don't have to be within the range of the animation to attack you. By just being around you, you'll take damage. Oops. One bullet will kill all the standard enemies and of course, they can walk through bloody doors.\n\nThe endingPerhaps this could have been redeemed had the ending had a fight, but the developer was too lazy to program another set of AI. Despite there being two monk like figures and a giant demon at the end, none of them do anything. There's no sense of urgency to defeat them and they don't even have animation. I can't for the life of me tell you why. When the game was first released, it was impossible to kill the monks required to finish the game. You could walk right through them, and bullet decals never showed up on them. This was later "fixed" and was claimed to have been a bug. I believe the developer just forgot to add an ending to their game, as once you do actually finish it all you get is a silly splash screen which implies that there might be MORE of this to come.\n\nWhy is this allowed on SteamI couldn't tell you. This is a sad excuse of a game that has a lot of purchsed assets used for it. There's no creativity at all. Even at this low price, Steam has to have some sort of quality control, and this is a shining example of how much they've let themselves go.\n\nIs it worth the jokeNo. Unlike Bad Rats where you can get an actual laugh out of it, this has nothing redeeming about it. To try and remedey this, the developer added "Silly Mode" which makes your guns shoot various animals and adds a fart/burp button. Real funny.\n\nIn closingThis has been the first use of Steams refund system for me. I understand that it was only $0.24, but understanding the leveling/drop system that Steam added along with the trading cards, the cards I could buy with those $0.24 will have a much stronger impact than having this game in my library. This should have been posted to a forum where the developer could have gotten constructive criticism on their game and learned from their mistakes rather than try and sell it.\n\nEdits- Sadly, this edit wasn't to praise the game in anyway, just fix a simple spelling error.\n- Other users have done more digging, finding out that almost EVERYTHING is a premade, purchased asset. There's nothing wrong with using some, but when you're whole game uses them and you've barely crafted anything around them... there's something wrong.\n- A recent patch has apprently reduced the speed at which your character runs. This does not help lengthen the game in a meaningful way, it just makes it more annoying. I wll NOT be purchasing it again so I can see how fast it's possible to get through it. The amount of health you have has also gone down, which would just make the game more annoying considering the awful AI and hit detection they have. No matter how many small patches you release, your game would still be completed within 10 minutes. Stop going into damage control, own up to what you did and remove your game from Steam. Use this as a lesson and stop ruining your name now.\nIt's not a rude thing to say to get it off Steam, it's only going to help you later on if you chose to continue pursuing your passion to be a proper developer. Seriously, save yourself.\n- There are some people arounjd the community who are still trying to defend the game, giving arguemtns like "at least it runs well!" or "the game at least looks decent!". Those aren't compliments when assets have been purchased and the game is running on an engine that was designed to run well on cheap, consumer grade hardware. Stop defending it and do a bit of research.","August 2, 2015","false","1.2"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","35","36","3","0"

Here are a few of the problems I saw:\n\nThe levels are not laid out in a lgical way. There are areas that look like you can walk to but, when you try, a message pops up on the screen saying you have not yet finished all goals from the previous area and you are not allowed to go further. If these areas are meant to be completed in a linear fashion, then the level should be laid out that way.\n\nThe level designer doesn't understand how to make logical borders to the level. I found an open field and tried to cross it. Part way across, I suddenly was blocked by an invisible wall. There was no visible barrier, just a point where I could no longer walk forward. To design a level that makes sense to the player, there should be a visible barrier to show the player they cannot continue beyond that point.\n\nThe monsters stand complete motionless until you get within an indeterminate distance. When you are close enough for them to "sense" you, they suddenly rotate to face you and start chasing.\n\nAlong the same point, the monsters are not animated until they are close to the player. Even when they begin to chase you, they stand upright in their idle pose and slide along the ground. Then, when they are close, they suddenly drop into a crouching walk animation that doesn't really look natural.\n\nAll the monsters I saw glow red but, only on their front. I don't understand this choice. If the dev wanted the monsters to glow, the entire monster should glow. How did this wierd effect get passed them?\n\nI found a clip in one of the drawers but could not pick it up. Each time I tried to interact with it, all that happened was, the drawer closed. This is a problem with collision bounds.\n\nThe monsters seem to be able to see the player through and walk through walls so, when a monster respawns outside a house you are searching, they will immediately show up where you are searching and kill you.\n\nThere were other things that irritated me but, I think this list is good enough to show the many problems this game has. Unfortunately, these aren't just little bugs that can be fixed. To correct these problems, the dev would have to completely change the levels and creature models and animations. That being said, no I would not suggest anyone buy this game.","October 5, 2015","false","4.1"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

Why? The game is broken from the very start. Let me count the ways.\n\n1)You get a quick guide in the main menu on what button does what. If you do not pay attention, you will going to have a bad time.\n\n2)There is no options for anything. The sounds are horrible to listen to and I want to turn them off, but I can't. Mute the PC to get sometime to think what am I doing in the game.\n\n3)If you die, you will respawn in the same spot you started from. Too bad the enemy do not respawn after you die or better yet, reset themselves after you die. They tend to gravitate towards you, so if you die... They will move towards your position. If you do not move very quickly, they will swarm up and gang up on you. And you will die, die, and die over and over again. Until you turn off the game.\n\n4)The enemy has a range of attack from 6 feet away , but you have no real range but right in front of you. I was inside the building and got attacked from the outside and when I stepped out from the building, I found the enemy facing away from me attacking the air and it hit me. I look behind me and found nothing.\n\n5)The enemy moves about one step faster than you. Which sucks, due to the fact you can not outrun the enemy attack range nor the horde.\n\n6) I hope your favorite color is red. Because you will be seeing it every single time you play this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.\n\nDigiHom, you need to sit in the corner and think about your gaming career. We do not need a rushed, unpolished game. No more games that look like it was done over the weekend and left to rot without updates to fix problems. The only good thing this game has are cards, but DigiHom make a profit when someone sells them.\n\nSo, what should we do to fix DigiHom. Do not buy any of their games, until they are able to make a patch for them.  Do not sell any cards, until they stop putting out rushed broken games. And most of all, please do not say this game is GOTY. It deserves the WGOTY award for everything above.

It's certainly not even worth the 19p sale price I paid for it. Wouldn't recommend this game at all in its current state.\n\nThe graphics of the game are quite nice (for Unity Engine anyway), but that's about the only positive I can say on this game.\nThe combat is awkward as all heck; the one type of red "demon" enemy (nicely modelled, plus nice to see corpses linger around after death) dies in 1 shot with any of the 3 guns, but they spawn in out of thin air at times and can attack you through walls/doors (sometimes they clip through the doors) at some range.\nYou might die once or twice on your first playthrough due to these enemies, although death just means respawning back at the start with your weapons/progress saved, making it somewhat meaningless. The game lasts about 10-20 minutes and you're mostly guided through it effectively due to the mission tracker and how small the game area is. (with the one exception of the SCAVENGE FOR SUPPLIES part, in which you're asked to grab some floating ammo that can be easily mistaken for spent rounds, since they glow the same radioactive green...) The ending is extremely abrupt as well.\n\nSilly Mode is hilarious for a few minutes at least.

You never cease to amaze me. This game was certainly... a thing. Not the worst game I've ever played, but not far off either. This game mildly suffers from "what-do-i-do?" syndrome; It drops you into the town-setting with nothing but a vague objective at the top of the screen. Thankfully, none of the objectives are very difficult to figure out. When you do complete one, the game serenades you with a very loud fanfare-type noise. And believe me, you will be completing many objectives very quickly. Pick up the flashlight? FANFARE. Find a key? FANFARE. Find the house accross the street? FANFARE.\n\nThe enemies, though not difficult, did pose me a major challenge. The range of their attacks is very far, and they can seemingly swipe at you through walls and up entire staircases (if their animation even plays, that is). Unless you are looking at them directly, it is impossible to know the enemies are coming. They move absolutely silently and usually without animation. Their spawn pattern is awful, as well. They seem to be on some sort of timer system, meaning they can appear in front of, or behind, you at any time. Luckily, the... erm... "Silly Mode" does give you weapons that have unlimited "ammo", making this part just a bit easier.\n\nThough the technical issues are many, the major flaw to this game is the lack of clarity. It drops you into a town and says "do this" without any explanation or motivation. Was it too difficult to include a single intro screen that says "Kill the Devil worshippers and save the town"? Instead you're prompted by objectives, telling you to "get the flashlight, then the gun, then get this key and open that door to get the other key to open that door for yet another key to get the explosives..." blah blah blah.\n\nIf I were the creator of this game, I'd be too embarrassed to submit this to GameJolt or IndieDB, let alone Steam. This game needs major work before it can be considered anything other than a weekend experiment with Unity.","August 1, 2015","false","0.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Overall, aesthetically the game looks nice. The weapons feel nice and are responsive however, the gameplay itself really trumps the good qualities this game seems to offer.  First and foremost are the recognizable sudden FPS drops experienced during gameplay especially when looking towards the center of the map.  Also, the melee attack range for the enemies are way off due to the fact that they can hit you far in adavnce before you can even use your melee attack on them, and even notably worse is the fact the AI enemies can hit you with thier excessively long reach attack through walls and doors.  Also, the enemies can seemingly walk right through doors and walls.  And not to mention the enemies spawn out of nowhere behind the player and make no sound whatsoever to alert their presence to you.  All of the aformentioned issues with the enemy AI makes any chance of meleeing them useless.  Another issue to mention is the interaction system for opening drawers and obtaining items in them seems to be glitched.  However these are just a few of the issues I have experienced with the game, below is my rating for this game:\n\nPros:\n*Very nice and immersive atmosphere.\n\n*Good graphics and nice lighting effects.\n\n*Responsive weapons.\n\n*Good story premise overall (despite it being simple and quick)\n\nCons:\n-AI have an absurdly long attack range which makes melee with them useless as they will\nalways hit you first, plus each hit takes away 10 damage from your health.\n\n-AI spawns pretty much everywhere all the time seemingly and can glitch through objects.\n-FPS drops suddenly at times.\n\n-Faulty opening system for drawers/cabinets makes them hard to open sometimes and items are\noften glitched inside the said drawers/cabinets.\n\n-Somewhat confusing object completion list system at times.\n\n-If you are not practically speedrunning through the entire game you most likely will make\nit out with 70% or less health at best, so there is little room for exploration without\nbeing mobbed by randomly spawning, silent, absurdly long area of attack, wall glitching\nenemies.  Which all these factors leave for little to no exploration or immersion into the\ngame..even if the game itself is short.\n\n-Weapon hit-detection system can be dodgy at times\n\n-Invisible brushes block weapons fire on certain parts in the map\n\nOverall synopsis:\n\nThis game has potential, but with the certain current issues, with the most obvious being\nthe faulty AI attack system and random spawns all around you this game in my opinion lacks\nthe basics for being decent even for independent developer standards.\n\nrating breakdown:\n\n-4 very poor all-around AI enemy aspects (this includes their spawning and attack range as\nwell as all afromentioned issues in regards to the disadvantges their attack range and\nsilent random spawning has)\n\n-1 glitchy opening cabinent/drawer mechanics making some main story items difficult to\naquire\n\n-0.5 invisible brushes blocking bullets and sometimes confusing/misleading objectives list system\n\n-2 AI issues mentioned earlier making exploration, further immersion, and melee nearly\nimpossible or very difficult\n\n(rating score: 10 - 7.5 = 2.5)\n\n2.5/10 overall rating for this game (The AI and spawning issues are what really drags this\ngame down in my opinion above all else).","August 15, 2015","false","3.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

However, you'll survive longer in silly mode, and actually have an arsenal that makes a difference.\nOH WAIT, THIS IS DIGITAL HOMICIDE ISN'T IT?\nWELL THEN, 'NUFF SAID.\n\nSTOP MAKING GAMES.

Enemies make no noise, so you'll just start bleeding health from an enemy that you had no way of knowing was behind you.\n-EVERY. SINGLE. OBJECTIVE is a boring fetch quest. Since getting killed has no consequences, you basically just die, walk to the next objective, die, walk to the next objective. The game has no skill involved; it's just a major  battle of attrition- how long until you give up out of irritation.\n-There are no health packs. You will die constantly.\n-There seems to be exactly one place to find ammo for any gun; most of the areas and buildings are completely empty traps to waste your time.\n-You're supposed to be able to dash inside a building and close the door so the enemies can't touch you while you rummage for supplies, but enemies phase through doors. Um... oops.\n-I had to start the game over about five times because I kept dying without having found any ammo for the handgun and you respawn with the same ammo you died with.\n-Running the game in fullscreen results in a graphical glitch where the brightness is turned down so far you can't see anything.

The map is poorly made, a lot of textures are off and stand out when compared to the environment, and it feels like the creator didn't even bother to test the game before posting it (and how this got through and onto the market I will never understand). It took me an hour or so to beat because of the lack of direction and narrative. For 24 cents I had a good laugh at how horrible this is.","August 6, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really disliked it, And not like a "I hate this because of the genere" or "I hate this because of how buggy it is." It is more of the feeling of how incomplete it is.\nFrom the guns, which each one is a one hit kill for any of the deamon things.\nTo the fact that the demons can just walk through doors without a care in the world.\nAnd one problem I had was the face that I felt lost through the game. After I got my pistol I did not know what to do because it did not intruct me where to go. But when I happen to go inside a house I just so happen to get diffrent objectives to get a key just so I can go somewhere to get another key.\nThe Soundtrack, Is just a repeat. Because when ever you pick up a item you are greeted with RRRAAAAAAWWWWRRR\nI bought this when it was 76% off. That means I spent 0.26 cents on this "Game"\nAm I mad?

After finishing them you can continue to the town where you have another few tasks.\nIn my opinion, the idea is good, but it hasn't been made the proper way.\n\nLet's sum things up.\n\nPros:\n- Nice idea\n- The map is good\n- Has a nice atmosphere\n- Has a ''Silly mode''\n- You can see your legs and arms\n- Those monsters can be killed with one hit\n\n\nCons:\n- The graphics aren't really good\n- You can hear the monsters even if they aren't nearby\n- Zombies randomly spawn in houses/go through walls?\n- There are some things like walls but you can actually go through them\n- Shooting animals can block doorways\n- Only 9 bullets in the pistol when you get it (maybe that's okay for people I'm not sure)\n- Tons of zombies coming out of nowhere\n- Zombies ''float'' instead of walk.\n- I feel like this game is kinda too hard for me?\n\nFinal Verdict:\nThis game has trading cards which you can sell and make a profit if you get this game on sale.\nThe idea is pretty good but the game could be much, much better. Silly mode is awesome in my opinion. You can spam-shoot cows/goats/pigs becoming almost invincible.\n\nWell, I hope my review was somewhat helpful.

Even though it was pitch black, you have to find a flashlight in the pure darkness! Ironic! I LOVE it!\n\nOn top of that, they added a horror type game with a very neat action scenario, letting you shoot and such even though it's a horror game! Innovative!\n\nIn this game you will find:\n\n- Extremely well done AI\n- Perfectly textured guns, walls, floors, etc.\n- Brilliantly innovative weapons, tools, and other such things\n- An amazing storyline with a must-see backstory\n- Plenty of characters with a well-developed bio and characteristics!\n- A certain urge that always makes you want to come back!!!\n\nHowever, with every absolutely AMAZING game, comes a few cons!\n\n- Slight bugs while downloading, though I found it pretty easy to fix\n- A bit dark with playing fullscreen mode, easily changed by making the screen big!\n- Slightly Addictive\n- Easily obbsessive\n- Amazing game!!!\n\n9.3/10, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for an action/horror type scenario game. I find that the creators really spent a lot of work on this, and deserves every penny I used to buy this game! Please give it a try! If you get past the first 2 minutes, you will LOVE this game!!!","August 5, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","2","11","0","0"

This is the most fun I've ever gotten out of 27 cents. Game was on sale. This game is so awful, that it actually turned out amazing. This game includes already used assets, terrible flashlight aim, Postal 2's stolen text, the objective to search for items that are blatantly highlighted like they're made of plutonium, demons that barely have a running animation, and can fly into the sky and turn into a mess of stretched limbs, and lastly, lighting fires in the streets and running into a house you just set explosives outside of. The person who bought it for me expected me to play it for less than 5 minutes, and I have over an hour in the game. This is the most entertainment I've ever gotten out of something so cheap. I hope whoever made this makes a sequel. In conclusion, if you have a dollar to spare, you've gotta get this game. Oh and you also get stuck on stairs and have to jump to get in.

Devils (or, I assume was meant to be spelled "Devil's") Share is an extremely poorly made Unity FPS that manages to make the whole 15 minutes you need to beat it feel like a lifetime.\n\nThe gameplay revolves around going from Point A to B, picking up keys or interacting with something, and repeating it until it's all over. While this is happening, what look like stock asset Unity zombies slide along the ground and clip through walls, hitting you from 7 feet away. Occasionally they'll do this pathetic flail animation, which I assume is their attack, but I'm still not sure. That is the lone enemy throughout the entire thing, save for the "boss fight". During the said boss fight, you shoot two humanoid things for roughly 10 seconds, then the game ends and you get some text that implies there's going to be a sequel; which I hope is a lie or a dire attempt at humor.\n\nYou can get 4 different weapons, but there's no point in using anything that isn't the handgun since everything dies in one shot anyways. Why use a shotgun that can only hold 6 shells when you could use a handgun with 20 bullets?\n\nThe visuals are what you would expect from a Unity game that looks like it was made in under a week. Trees and decoration clip through walls, player collision with half the objects is non-existent, and the same building is re-used about 5 times. Not only that, but even on the lowest settings, there are occasional lag spikes. I don't play on a toaster, either.\n\nThere isn't much to say about the audio department. Everything has boring stock sounds and the zombies have one single death noise. The "song" during the entire game is a 10 second loop of a generic 'spooky' noise.\n\nOn sale, the game is 0.24. Even if you sold every card at standard market price, you would lose a couple cents total. It's not even worth it for the cards. Don't buy this. Ever.","August 1, 2015","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the kind of game that usually only exists as a downloadable in it's own thread in a Unity forum, with a single amateur developer or two behind it. As such, it lacks all the solutions to problems that a professionally developed game should have. It shows in the way you move, jump, clip through solid walls, simplistic enemy AI. Supposedly the assets are payed for, since they don't match the gameplay's quality.\n\nIt's all what could be expected by a spare time developer taking on a project as big as an FPS, but does it belong on Steam?

It should be included as an example in video game programming classes as what not to do. I haven't seen this much fail since Cheetahmen II on the NES. To say the game's controls are inconsistent and unresponsive is  an understatement, because I couldn't open half of the drawers despite button mashing the action button. Also, apparently the game knows it's bad and won't let you quit, because I literally had to go to Task Manager just to exit the game.\n\nWas it worth the 10 cents I paid for it?

The game looks great for the most part. Highest settings on a 650ti and it ran pretty well, a lot better than most games made with the unity engine. I have to hand it the the devs for doing so. I didn't encounter any game breaking bugs (although I did play it after the "patch"). It played smoothly too. So far, so good right?\n\nWell, here is the context that I mentioned; as other have stated in their reviews, the majority, or even the entirety, of the assets used in this game were prepurchased, so whether or not the reason behind this game meant for it to run as well as it did seems more like a fluke than anything. It's hard to give my credit to them on this basis and, by proxy, it might as well be a negative (although to the person who actualloy made the assets, props to you. they run wonderfully).\n\nThat's is probably the most dissapointing aspect about this game, but it really doesn't end there. The game does show some promise, but are hampered by several things. First off, the game felt sluggish throughout the whole playthrough.  The main character does not give off the impression of being a mobile individual. Even sprinting does not accomplish much, although it does last pretty much forever, so you have that in your favour. Even if you were as mobile as an olympic sprinter, it doesn't seem to matter; enemies can magically spawn beside you to deal some cheap damage. It's as if the game recognizes you are winning too easily and decides to ♥♥♥♥ with you\n\nSpeaking of easy, the game itself is the definition of that word. You will probably never play another game that is as linear as this. Even visual novels have more freedom than Devil's Share. Everything is highlighted for you, what you need to pick up, what your objectives are, even the enemies have a slight tinge of red as they shamble towards you, so you can't miss em. At this point, you might say "well I'll just explore on my own then"! Well, good luck to that endeavor.   As soon as you put one toe outside of the invisible boundaries where your current objectives are, the game will remind you in the most belligerent manner to turn around and do as it tells you. I'm not sure if it was the intention of the developer to allude to 1984, but that's what it feels like trying to deviate from your objective.\n\nEverything dies in one hit, which makes the objectives of finding a shotgun and rifle meaningless. By the end of the game, you will have enough ammo for your pistol to one shot everything you see. I am not sure if this is an oversight by the devs, but this severely deflates anything resembling a challenge in this game. The enemies have massive hitboxes for how small they are, so there is literally no room for error. The only thing that could be considered a challenge here is that enemies can also teleport behind you, spawn when they feel like it, hit you from behind doors, among other things. This isn't a challenge due to good design, mind you, but I guess the devs mistook frustration with difficulty.\n\nDESPITE the last part, it doesn't matter in the end; dying means nothing in this game as you simply revive with full health, complete with ammo collected. There is very little resembling a story to be found as well, so there is no fallback  from the bad gameplay. There isn't even a soundtrack to do that as well. Nothing is good about this game save for the pre-purchased assets not made by the developer for this game. I would recommend you just take that 25 cents and, if you were impressed by the assets used, give it directly to them instead. That, or save your 25 cents for a sale and buy the endless indie games worth the same price, but actually have something in them resembling a game.","August 3, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I came to conclution that this game actually had no effort to make. 100% of the items the game has were bought from the Unity store and the creator just paste them into this map that was also bought. There was nothing made by the creator of the game. Which i was fooled earlier because i gave a good rating thinking that he came up with all this. I have nothing against buying Unity store, just at least make some effort making something out of your own sweat, not just putting together everything you bought from the store and calling it a game. The total ammount spent on creating this game as it is right now is $170.00. I am sorry but selling this game for a dollar its still should be unfair because there was no effort in this creation. I would gladly had spend more than the 0.24 cents on this game if there was at least some effort in this game. Not to say that you rarely respond back to people when they give you feedback on the glitches. Anyways, poor effort on the game and this should not be even called a game.","August 3, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

I can't say I recommend this either. If this was someone's first project for a game or even a small inexperienced group trying their hand at a game, it isn't horrible.\n\n~Pros~\n-Silly mode (PETA would love this)\n-Cheap price (you have to admit, it's ever so slightly well-put together as opposed to some Early Access games)\n\n~Cons~\n-Same objectives (go to building, pick up keys, shoot enemy, and repeat)\n-Buggy and/or glitchy movement (To quote Francis: "I hate stairs")\n-Only one type of enemy (it's literally a ghoul model from the Unity asset store)\n-Only three weapons ("Use a variety of weapons" said the description)\n-Random enemy spawn (the ghouls just spawn and then attack you out of nowhere)\n-Random ammo spawn (once you've picked up your gun, ammo will spawn out of nowhere)\n-No restart (you die and then respawn at the beginning of the level with all your weapons and the remaining ammo)\n-Unoriginal content (like the ghoul model, the developer used content from the Unity asset store)\n-No story whatsoever (I didn't even know the main character was named "Victor Locke" until I read the game description)\n-Exiting the game will close the program as well (self-explanatory)\n-No settings in-game (can't change sensitivity, can't adjust brightness, can't lower/raise the audio, etc)\n\nIt's not the worst game I've ever played, nor is it actually fun in any way possible. The developer bought content from the Unity asset store, mashed it all up together, named it, "Devils Share," and then sold it for, like, a dollar. This feels more of a demo for programming newbies starting in Unity, actually. If this was free, and the developer wanted feedback on how he/she/they did with his/her/their programming, then sure, I'd take it. Otherwise, just wait until it's on sale.

It is literally stiched together from various free and paid assets from the Unity Dev Store.\nIt would be different if they actually produced some of their own content, and tried to be original in some way, but they weren't. Their only "saving grace" (which isn't even at all justifiable) is that they added objectives to an otherwise completely empty and stiched together game.

I came to conclution that this game actually had no effort to make. 100% of the items the game has were bought from the Unity store and the creator just paste them into this map that was also bought. There was nothing made by the creator of the game. Which i was fooled earlier because i gave a good rating thinking that he came up with all this. I have nothing against buying Unity store, just at least make some effort making something out of your own sweat, not just putting together everything you bought from the store and calling it a game. The total ammount spent on creating this game as it is right now is $170.00. I am sorry but selling this game for a dollar its still should be unfair because there was no effort in this creation. I would gladly had spend more than the 0.24 cents on this game if there was at least some effort in this game. Not to say that you rarely respond back to people when they give you feedback on the glitches.

I mean it looks great and the gameplay is kinda fun but it feels like a game that is still in beta. If the developers put more time into it I feel that it would be a awesome game. The game is simple and quick to complete once you get the hang of it but the ending is aweful and needs work. The first time I played it I hated it because it annoyed me like hell but as I said before once you play it for little bit it starts to grow on you and you start to think that the game developers could have really made something of this game.

I came to conclution that this game actually had no effort to make. 100% of the items the game has were bought from the Unity store and the creator just paste them into this map that was also bought. There was nothing made by the creator of the game. Which i was fooled earlier because i gave a good rating thinking that he came up with all this. I have nothing against buying Unity store, just at least make some effort making something out of your own sweat, not just putting together everything you bought from the store and calling it a game. The total ammount spent on creating this game as it is right now is $170.00. I am sorry but selling this game for a dollar its still should be unfair because there was no effort in this creation. I would gladly had spend more than the 0.24 cents on this game if there was at least some effort in this game. Not to say that you rarely respond back to people when they give you feedback on the glitches. Anyways, poor effort on the game and this should not be even called a game.","August 3, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

My friend got it as a GAG gift. Upon playing it, you realise you can't get past the constantly spawning zombies as they spawn in front of the houses and deal 10% damage every time you get within 15 meters. Silly mode was a fun surprise, until you realise this is a horror game and on the front page of the game the word 'silly' appears in front of a floating demon. Furthermore, what the ♥♥♥♥ is the plot? I'm railroaded into searching for stuff, and if I begin to explore the game politely screen♥♥♥♥s me into submission.
