"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/435800/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Binaries is the Steam debut of Ant Workshop Ltd, a tiny indie video game developer and game consultancy firm that is based in beautiful Edinburgh, Scotland. They carefully chose the name of their studio after ants because, in their words, they are ‘small, sociable and very hardworking.’ Though I wasn’t able to confirm their size through communications with them I was able to confirm that they are definitely friendly and the amount of work that has gone into making Binaries one of the smartest new puzzle-platformers on Steam attests to their hardworking nature.\n\nIt is this hardworking nature that definitely pays off with the quality of their game. It’s a game where you are tasked at guiding two cute through brightly colored challenges. Although I bring into question the game’s validity of being the first concentration platform game – which it bills itself as being on its website – it definitely made me concentrate a lot more than I thought that I was going to do throughout the game.\n\nWith 101 levels contained within the game there is certainly more than enough content to justify the $9.99 price tag. In fact, I would go so far as to suggest that when the game is on any multiple figure discount that the game should be considered an absolute bargain. It’s not just a quantity over quality type equation for the game either. Every level that I have played through feels as though it belongs and hasn’t simply been added to the game to bump up the arbitrary number of levels. It’s certainly a case of quality and quantity here.\n\nI quite enjoyed the fact that the game has a non-linear map. Certain levels are colored blue and others are orange. I’m unsure whether this is intended to signify that one level is harder than another or not but you do need to control balls of both colors through every level. Perhaps the reason that I do not know the answer to this question is because I was having too much fun and I was quickly selecting the next level and the next and so on. Unlike many infuriating platformer games where you have no choice in what level you play next you and has you quitting because you cannot defeat that next level having the choice of picking another level makes the game player friendly.\n\nThere’s an enormous amount of replayability within the game. With timed awards for each level – S, A and B – you will constantly find yourself returning to previous levels to best your personal bests. Even when you have unlocked S on a level you may feel as though you’re capable of beating your best time.\n\nThe presentation of the graphics and the sound are top notch. The developer added the soundtrack to Steam as purchasable DLC because there was a demand for it among the playing base. The game’s music changes dependent upon how you are faring in each level. If you’re playing poorly it will slow down and try to aide your concentration but if you’re doing superbly well the soundtrack can become quite frantic and will help keep you in the zone.\n\nFinally, the game has been Steamified with trading cards and Steam achievements.\n\nWhat more could you possibly ask for from a puzzle-platformer? This game is fantastic and is highly addictive.\n\nFor more reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com.","May 2","true","15.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

There is tons of challenge in this game, lots of times to beat and levels to get through. I like the option of different levels on the main screen, in case I get stuck. The graphics are well done and minimalistic, and the game itself is sarcastic and funny. It gives you enough gameplay to keep you interested, even if you cant solve the ever-challenging puzzles that go along with it.\n\n","April 4","true","0.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kemp_j/recommended/435800/","kemp_j","Kemp_J","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kemp_j/","737 products in account","Fun platformer that rapidly progresses from "this doesn't seem so hard" to "WHAT IS THIS AND WHAT IS MY LIFE?!". In theory you have time to think between each action, but in reality you're going to end up throwing yourself into it and hoping your reflexes can keep up. Trust me on this, tracking two balls seems straightforward but it is a recipe for ragequitting. The visual style is simple and slick, with everything you see providing you with a piece of information. There's no visual distraction from your task. It can't be emphasised enough how important this is for a game. Overall I'd recommend it if you like this style of platform puzzler or games such as Mercury.","April 17","true","0.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

Binaries is like the genius love child of the two genres.\n\nThe concept is very intriguing: controlling two blocks to get each one to a separate goal. It looks odd on paper, but Binaries executes it flawlessly. The levels pose a very good challenge, but not to the point of being neigh impossible. I'd say it's more NES hard than I Wanna Be The Guy hard.\n\nGraphically, it's a damn good looking game. The best way I can describe it is like PAC-MAN™ Championship Edition - It's minimalistic, but it's beautiful.\n\nThe music in this game is phenomenal, so much so that I kinda want to buy the soundtrack. That's something I hardly ever say about any video game, even AAA titles. The sound effects aren't too bad, either.\n\nThe game controls marvelously on the XB1 controller. There was never a time when I felt it controlled too loose nor tight, it's right there in the Goldilocks zone where, within two levels, you have the physics down to a T.\n\nShould you buy it? YES! Buy it now! Hell, I'd get the soundtrack along with the game! And seriously, Ant Workshop, you should put this on the console stores. No joke, you would make a killing!","April 13","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Each time you think you've seen all that can be done, a level appears with something new to keep things fresh. It's a masterpiece of level design. If you get stuck there are always plenty of levels to try instead on the level select screen.\n\nThere are 101 levels, each with par time rankings to beat. Developer will be adding global rankings (among other requested features) which the speedrunners and streamers should love.\n\nHighly recommend you pick this up and see if you're as good at puzzle games as you think you are.","April 17","true","2.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jakepeter/recommended/435800/","jakepeter","SS.jakepeter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jakepeter/","175 products in account","Quick and short version: Loved it, a great new premise for a puzzle game. Could soak hours into it if you wanted to race friends times. If no friends you might get bored after beating each level once or twice. (See gameplay in video below).\n\n~Overall Score - 8.75/10\n\nLong version: For a puzzle game I can really admire this. It is a lot different of a game than you might orginally think, innovative you could say to some extent. I've only played about the first 10 levels or so, but I've seen some of the higher levels you can get to in their intro video. I would highly recommend this game if you are a puzzler that likes a challenge, or even if you are a casual gamer that may only have 5 minutes to spare at times.\n\nGameplay - 10/10 - For being a puzzle game it sticks to it's guns. You get exactly what you are expecting, besdies some of the levels being tricky, but that is part of the expereince. Figuring out how to beat a level is what makes you want to play it again and again. 101 levels seems like a lot, and it will have you playing for several hours to beat them all, but how many hours more will it take to master them all is another question. You also have the ability to skip levels if you are stuck, which is great to give yourmind a rest when you are too puzzled.\n\nReplayability - 8/10 - Lots, if you like to challenge yourself. The game does have 3 internal rankings S, A, and B in order of highest rank for fastest time possible. If you are one that wants to get that high ranking you will play each level many different times. IF you don't that's where the drop in score comes in, and you can only improve so much before most won't find it as fun to0 grind those small numbers.\n\nGraphics - 9/10 - Not everything needs oto be state of the art, and for being a simple game it gets simple graphics. Although the theme is orange it blue, it could use some sprucing up in color in spots you need need to move on or in the menues. This may just be a personal feel.\n\nControls - 8/10 - This game does come with controller support, seeing as you move both balls at once it is only as tr4icky to use as you will make it to paly, I didn't try it out though. Although I do find it a bit wonky you can't remap the keys and the only way to jump is either spacebar or the enter key on keyboard mode.\nFor more reference and what the first ten levels have in store for you here is a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0oENe7jHJA","April 12","true","3.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It´s also one of the hardest games I EVER played... I love the concept and the concept makes the difficult. Those "Jokes" are, well, let´s say they could be better. Achievments are pretty hard too, because S-Rank times are really hard to get at some levels.
