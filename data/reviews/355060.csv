No Never. Even not after the awfull patch after 2 months\n\nIntroduction\n\nDear Milestone,\n\nI am very surprised by your work. You've as company improved a lot from WRC 1 2 3 and 4. It is not in the class of Dirt Rally, but it's a huge improvement over these previous games. There are some remarkable things to see; like tracks, cars, graphics, skytexures, and more.\n\nI am glad to give you the important points I've found in your game. If you can fix this you can perhaps stand proudly next to Dirt Rally; this means you can challenge each other to be become better over the years.\n\nCompetition is what we need as customers, as gamers, as rally-enthusiasts, and more. I hope you do something with my feedback and not neglect to support the game. Good luck!\n\nThe bugs and design choices; highlighted the most important\n\n- No auto-center-steering when restart/reset.\n\n-   I am using a TX servo base, default 900 degrees, in-game automatic, etc. There is no steering for like 180 degrees from the center, so 90 left, 90 right.\n\n- 900 degrees feels like 1800, 540 like 900, etc etc. (Mostly on FWD and RWD)\n\n- Old FWD / RWD / AWD feels ackward compared to Modern AWD cars\n\n- Can't make tiny corrections while steering. Steering is very rude.\n\n- Cars are too tame; RWD's too planted, can throttle 100% out of corners, etc.\n\n- Concrete bushes, pole, trash bins and more. No "rag-doll"\n\n- When rolling on the roof you can see though the road\n\n- Pause button can't be remapped.\n\n-  No subtitles for in video's\n\n-  No fov adjustement for triple screen\n\n- Very understeery\n\n- Setup slots are shared slots for all cars.\n\n- Texture pop-ups, like fences, trees etc.\n\n- No real damage. Damage is set to heavy, but nothing happens. Only visual.  Seems to be very random\n\n- Little to no punctures/flatties; Too robust, but it can happen.\n\n-  No multiply devices support; means a different wheel and different pedals will not work together (as example T300 + Fanatec pedals will not work. In other "sims" they will)\n\n- Bugged keybindingmapping\n\n- Tracks too wide, but that's probably a good things with the awful steering on a lot of cars.\n\n- Wheel calibration must show the actual wheel degrees; when you go to the right you must have 900% when using 900% degrees. Now you don't know what wheel degrees you will have when you must calibrate to the right which results in incorrect input.\n\nWhat I like\n\n- Cars; I want to tame all the FWD's that Dirt Rally has <3\n\n- Tracks; they remind me of RBR vanilla. Which are awesome too.\n\n- Graphics\n\n- Sky-textures\n\n- Overall presentation; Menu, Loeb experience.\n\n- Triple screen.\n\n- Force Feedback, also when lost a tyre.\n\nBelow the changelog:\n\n- Support 21:9 - Good, but no fov-adjustement\n- Fix Saves  - Good\n- Support Triple-monitor - Good, but no fov adjustement\n- Fixed Logitech wheels minor issues - Don't have a logitech\n- Fixed Time Upload issues - Good\n- Minor Fixes - No idea what they have fixed.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe steering is still awfull as before the patch.  It's the same as before... but with triple screen support.\n\nNext time when you release Loeb Evo 2 or any other rally-game please consider the help of Early Access. All your problems could have been solved by Early-Access or experienced Beta-testers.\n\nHave a fine day.\n\nIvy.\n\nTips for the stubborn people; Don't calibrate your wheel. Set pacenotes on early or so and steer a lot of meters in advance. use gloves to prevent blisters, cause you need to rotate the wheel a lot due poor steering/handling\n\nTested with a Thrustmaster TX, T3PA-Pro's, Heusinkveld Seq Shifter, Th8A","January 31","false","50.9"," 308 of 345 people (89%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","89","308","345","13","15"

I'm curious as to how much input he had with Milestone, as there are quite some glaring oversites  that have totally been overlooked in this game.  1.) Do the employees at Milestone own a car, and if so, does it have a steering wheel, because this game handles horribly. 2.) What kind of vacuum cleaner did they use for the engine sounds. No immersion at all; the sounds are so bad, it literally makes you want to exit the game. 3.) The ways your car can literally get stuck on objects, you would think it was a magnet at times. Just the total lack of steering input again is astounding; it boggles the mind. During a race, if your windshield gets filthy, you can not activate your windshield wipers. That is only available when it's raining, and  you have no control over it. I own Dirt Rally, RBR, a number of Dirt games, and the old Mobil One Rally Championship from Magnetic Fields, which beats this game even now, and that game came out in 1999. This is the first, and the last Milestone game I will ever buy. It's really ashame, because the stages are not that bad. When you're playing a rally game, you should be able to push your car to the limit, take some chances and for some of the time, not all; be able to maintain control of your car while on the limit.  SLRE unfortunately does not allow you that sensation of speed, or risk taking balls of the seat driving. It's like the car is a pogo stick waiting to bounce you off the road. Any one looking for a rally game that is current, needs to look no further than Dirt Rally. It doesn't have nearly the amount of  tracks, but the immersion and game handling by far out weighs that small fact, and new tracks will be available in the future. I give SLRE a thumbs down!","February 2","false","20.2"," 107 of 129 people (83%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","83","107","129","18","0"

It has promise and could be better so I'll stick with it and see if things get better with more time played (however some items are deeper than a quick fix).  Of my time played half of it was setting up controls and getting the game to run smoothly.\n\nI express a bunch of my negative veiws in this review video. https://youtu.be/DvC8TCaka_I\n\nThe good, it looks better than WRC 5 and appears to have a better career mode.\n\nGame modes would also be a plus, rally, hill climb, and rallycross something for nearly everyone.\n\nStage lengths are ok, same as DiRT Rally 5km to 10km.\n\nPace ntoes are good, intuitive for those who have played rally games the past 10+ years unlike WRC 5.\n\n\nThe bad, no triple monitor support.  Oh sure you can select your triple screen resolution but it'll lag just trying to select to type your name in.  Runs fine on one screen.\n\nHandling, not sure how you fish tail a FWD car on tarmac but apparently you can.  Overall the handling feels stupid loose, and not realistic at all.\n\nStages, I've only driven in Finland but they have made the finish forest roads 1.5 cars wide.  ummmmmm they are much wider go watch some WRC footage.\n\nWheel support, they do support a variety of wheels but even on a G27 you have to do some profiler set-up before even calibrating it in the game.\n\nPace notes, how can they be both good and bad, well they are given in monotone no matter what is happening or the speed of the car.  If I'm going faster and there are successive calls you probably should rattle them off a bit faster.\n\nBasically I'll still give this title a chance just because I like rally games but I don't have high hopes for it to improve.\n\nSorry for the wall of text.","January 29","false","2.2"," 118 of 172 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","118","172","3","9"

No. Simply because there are to many bugs. I've experienced alot off stuttering. I've tried v-sync on and off, and it resulted in 2 different problems. For some reason with v-sync on, the game puts itself in 30 FPS for awhile and then suddenly goes up to 60 again. At 30 FPS the input lag is horrible. It's not fun when you have to steer 1-2 seconds before you actually have to steer just because the game doesn't recognize it properly in 30 FPS. With V-sync off i have between 80-100 FPS. The problem is screen-tearing and frequent stuttering (screen-tearing could be on my part because off an old monitor).\n\nEDIT: It seems that D3DOverrider worked to get most off the stuttering and FPS problem away. I have occasional FPS drop to 40-45 but it goes right back up to 60 again, so it's not a perfect solution but makes the game playable atleast. Here's a link to the version off D3DO i use: https://hostr.co/5JA4NRt (thanks @Cunin)\n\nNow to another issue, car vs road.\nIn my experience the Toyota Celica seem to have problems in Sweden with interaction on the road. It makes it more slippery than it's supposed to. On gravel and tarmac it seems fine though.\nHere's a clip i recorded yesterday with the issue:  https://youtu.be/195bnmqLvyk\nI've sent this to Milestone in hope for a fix. I've only experienced this with the Celica, so it might be the car itself. Haven't tried any other 4WD on snow yet.\n\nRWD seems to be a little funky too, at times. There isn't really any throttle control. I've tried the Stratos and an RWD Toyota and both have the same issue. It feels like there's to much grip. I can't feel it through the the wheel.\n\nMy settings in the Thrustmaster Control panel thing, is set to 100% on everything except dampening. In-game vibration is on highest and overall FFB is set to 60.\n\nSo to the physics. I would say it has potential to become very good. FWD is fun to drive and feels really good. Same thing with 4WD (except the Celica on snow). RWD needs more work to reach it's true potential, while FWD and AWD needs some polish.\n\nThe graphics aren't the best, but they're not that bad either. The stages looks as smooth as a babys butt, unfortunately. They don't feel like that if you crank up the FFB though. What i would like to see is potholes, bumps, ruts, deeper ditches in some places, more stones, something that looks like gravel, not only the color off gravel.\n\nOptions that are missing is an FOV slider, seat position adjustment, option to remove hands from the wheel/remove both arms and wheel completely.\n\nOnline doesn't work. Well, it works for some, randomly. I'm still waiting for my verification email (i've checked the spam folder). It's been almost a week since i registered.\n\nIf i where Milestone, i would put this game in EA instead. It wasn't ready for release yet. Luckily SLRE will get a patch soon and hopefully it'll fix the problems, or atleast the worst off them.","February 24","false","14.6"," 84 of 123 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","84","123","2","36"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PsychicParrot/recommended/355060/","PsychicParrot","PsychicParrot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PsychicParrot/","721 products in account","The short version: In my opinion this is a really fun rally game let down by performance problems, being overpriced by a dodgy publisher and scammy DLC.\n\nThe long version:\n4 hours in.. I'm having a really good time with it, actually. Sure the graphics are a bit last-gen and the physics are.. umm.. a bit buggy here and there.. but it's a really fun game with a decent amount of variation and some cracking cars. The design is nice (game design, too) and there's a lot of fun to be had.\n\nIt supports my G27 steering wheel out of the box .. no additional config required. I assume the people in the reviews talking about lack of steering wheel support must be talking about a version pre-patch because it detected my wheel and set it up correctly.\n\nThere's lots of events and cars to unlock, so a decent amount of content.. but enough to merit the 24GB download!? I assume it's so big due to all of the HD interviews with Loeb himself. Or maybe they couldn't fit his ego into 23GB?\n\nWatching the Loeb interviews is fairly painful thanks to generic voiceover man (since Loeb only speaks French here) and the fact that Loeb appears to be really really full of himself. After watching a couple of interviews, I think maybe they could have called the game Sebastien Loeb Rally EGO. That said, if I was as good a driver as he is I'd probably be an arrogant dude about it all too.\n\nIs this game $80 worth? Yes, and no.. just look at all the DLC. They are DLC'ing us to death. It's horrible to see so much stuff laid out as DLC at day 1 launch and the $28 price tag on the Season Pass is a sick joke for an $80 game. $80 is a lot of money and.. well, that's just a lot of money. To then demand more just seems downright cheeky.\n\nIt's hard for me to hit the No button because I'm actually really enjoying the game.. but there are some horrible bugs that I'm only just becoming aware of further into it. It's frame rate drops and chugging at the worst moments that can put you into a ditch and end your nice clean run. I'm OK hitting this every once in a while but as the cars get faster, frame rate drops are getting more frequent. If they could fix up the performance some, it'd be a much safer bet.. but right now for me it's a great game being ruined by frame rate problems.\n\nThe biggest reason I have to hit the 'NO' to not recommend this is Milestone. They have in the past abandoned their games after launch. WRC4 game breaking audio crash bug, anyone? anyone? nope. Noone. Never fixed. Still there. If you decide to go ahead and buy it, be wary of Milestone's rep for ditching and running and not looking after you when things go wrong.\n\nIf you're in the market for hardcore realism, you do need to get Dirt Rally instead. Although I prefer the rally cross events in this game to rallycross in DR, this is more arcadey than DR and more casual for sure.","February 26","false","10.9"," 39 of 54 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","39","54","4","6"

About the content, it is just Dirt Rally with more content both on Cars, Stages and events. Still this is a First Impressions Review.\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED TO:\n-Those who can't decide between this or Dirt Rally or WRC 5 as a Rally game. Get DiRT Rally.\n-Those that want a casual racing experience.\n-Those who are not willing to deal with the bugs and can't ignore bad sound/graphics/performance.\n-Those who don't have a good gaming PC.\n-Those who have a steering wheel currently not supported on the game, mainly high-end gear. Check forum first.\n-Those that can't play without a add-on Handbrake or Button Box (No support)\n\nRECOMMENDED TO:\n-Those who are willing to deal with the bugs and can ignore bad sound/graphics/performance.\n-Those who played hours and hours of Dirt Rally and want more content in general.\n-Those who want a realistic rallying experience.\n-Those who have a good gaming PC\n-Those who have supported wheel. G27 works if "Allow game to adjust" is UNTICKED on the Profiler.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nGame PRO/CONS\n\nPRO:\n- Surprising amount of content on both Rally Stages and Cars from all eras of Rally (More content than Dirt Rally)\n- Stages are very narrow just like in real life.\n- Game physics and terrain surface/car dynamics are very realistic, definitely a simulation game if you turn off the Assists. Its debatable if this game simulation/driving part is better than Dirt Rally.\n- Like Dirt Rally, it simulates the challenges of Rally racing. So it is difficult but rewarding game experience.\n- Price is fair if you eliminate the bugs and performance issues. There is a lot of content for the money.\n- Progress and Car Unlock systems tied with Reputation and Credits earning. *We need more of credits based unlocks on racing simulations.\n\nCONS:\n- Unstable game-breaking performance, framedrops and micro-stutters that adds horrible input lag on controllers and wheels\n- Terrible and limited Graphics options, can only change the already limited options outside the game in a Launcher.\n- Terrible car sounds design, the sound is rough but the sound positioning is usable.\n- Mediocre but believable graphics,\n- Unpolished and very stupid amateur bugs, the game ONLY SAVES if you have ENGLISH UK selected on the Windows Control Painel>Region and Language Settings.\n-You will get stuck on the Tutorial if you choose it just after making your team because you need to select the type of controls you are using. ALT-F4 is only solution.\n- Stupid lack of support for simulation gear for a SIMULATION GAME (Common sense, please Milestone) like high-end Steering Wheels, Handbrake, Button Box, Joystick add-ons.\n- Limited usable steering wheel/controllers/keyboard when in-game, can not use the keyboard buttons if using a controller or steering wheel or controller. Meaning if you use a wheel you can not use the keyboard or joysticks to function in conjunction, I can't use my Logitech Extreme 3D PRO Flight Stick as Handbrake like I do in Dirt Rally and other racing sims.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\n\nAt the current state of the game I DO NOT recommend it, a lot of bugs and instabilities in the games performance. However if you are really getting bored with DiRT Rally and just want more rally content with a surprisingly good driving physics then feel free to get this game a try, you can refund it later anyway.\n\nBUT BE WARNED: You must deal with the bugs and annoyances of this game, if you are not a patient guy or gal, then stay FAR AWAY of this game.\n\nThe lack of response from the Developers on Milestone is very disrespectful to those that want this game to be at least playable with a stable performance.\n\nI made a First Impression / Review with some parody video with more in-depth look on the bugs, how to fix them, how is the physics, And other info.

Remember this game was delayed a year! to add polish and fix bugs.\n\nThe crash physics for the most part are a joke, just search youtube to see some of the most comical moon launches ever... as for the rest, well the "driving on ice" physics are strong with this one and don't even get me started on the way the cars handle jumps. If real rally cars handled like this almost all the rally drivers would be dead.\n\nThe stages are modelled on real stages and that's great! sadly they lack any real fidelity or detail, we have no camber on the roads, no ruts or potholes, instead they all look and feel like baby smooth motorways, the stage edges are mostly solid and lack detail, not to mention some of the ludicrous cuts that can be taken in both the rally and rallycross stages.\n\nIn typical Milestone fashion we get no support from the devs, no communication. People cant get the activation email to play online (I did, but had to sing up to another email provider to get it!), Major frame rate issues for most, some that can't even get the game to start! I'm luck enough to run a monitor with 2560 x 1080 resolution, I get black bars either side of my screen as the game does not fully support this resolution (the only game in my steam list that does not!). Sim gamers with triple monitors cant use them, problems with multiple input support... the list goes on and on. In 2016 its unacceptable to not support even the most popular, multiple input devices. They have labelled this game as the most realistic Sim in recant times... even WRC5 has better support than this.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I've stated in another thread here that I believe they do have a decent game under all the issues. Unfortunately they only seem to care about the console players and we ended up getting a crappy port and will ultimately get no support.\n\nI'm not bashing the game, rather just giving my impression of its current state.

This Review will change over playing time. Status: 02/07/2016 !!\n\nDear rally fan and dear Milestone team:\n\nFirst impression: much better than expected!\n\nBad things second:\n\n1. Microstutters appear very often, even if the framerate is constant 60 per second.\n2. Wheelsupport is no optimal yet. (Keyboard is not working during a race => only 1 controller is working during a race, so you cannot have for example a G27 wheel and a clubsport shifter together.\n3. Many Gravelstages are worse than the Vanilla RBR gravelstages (Mostly Australia and Mexico, Wales is okay for example)! Clearly a lack of time is the reason why the gravelstages are so bad in SLRE (Sebastien Loeb Rally EVO). Road textures are very simple and extremly repetetive and also the the road borders are non existing, looks like a 15 year old game. First impression is that its no fun to drive on those gravelstages.\n4. No tripplescreen support yet, but with the current performance it wouldnt work yet either.\n5. You have no tire choice in game, like in DIRT Rally! Sadly i hope they will add this!\n6. Damage. The damage on highest settings appear earlier after crashes than in DIRT Rally on highest settings, but its still not realistic. Please add a "simulation mode" to the damage settings with close to real strengh settings for the car. A 20-30 km/h hard impact can already rip a wheel off! We want that in SLRE also!\n7. Carsetups are done with sliders and no real values. We want Nm, etc.!\n\nTo the bright side of the game:\n\nPHYSICS\nThe physics are very good, even from a simulation freak standpoint. Cars over- and understeer like you expect it, like brakes also. Weight transfer works, but not sure yet if this is a bit damped in this game. Clearly Sebastien Loeb had a very good influence to Milestones affort to make a real sim this time. Is DIRT Rally better in this aspect, or RBR (Richard Burns Rally with and without NGP)?! I have no final conclusion yet but what i experienced to far that the tarmac physics are supperior to the DIRT Rally and also RBR Vanilla physics!! I never expected that to be the case, i must admit!\nGravelphysics appear good too, but i have to investigate a lot more time to validate this first impression.\n\nGRAPHICS\nSolid. Cars look nice and some tarmac stages are very beautiful and realistic. Pikes Peak is also very nice and bumpy, like the real one. Much better than DIRT Rally Pikes Peak and also much much better than RBR Pikes Peak MOD ;). Again you see where Sebastien Loeb gave most input! You can clearly see where he put his most time in: Tarmac physics, his Citroen Cars and Pikes Peak! This equals his interests and strenghts. I hope soon the other parts get same attention too!\n\nFORCE FEEDBACK\nQuite good, i only have a G27. So i can only compare between different simulations and not judge the full potential of the Force Feedback in SLRE => Better than DIRT Rally and around equal to RBR, but worse then RBR NGP.\n\nGAME SIZE\nMany nice and historic cars. Many many hours of fun :). Pikes Peak is great. Tarmac Rallies also. Long realistic and NARROW stages :)\n\nRallyCross is a nice addition and very much fun, i have a smile on my face all the time. I actually have not enjoyed a simulator for a long time this much! Drifting is wonderfull precise and the A.I. is fast, is not breaking too often too early, like in other titles! and also very agressive which i quite like in RallyCross! Its not clean racing like in IRacing, guys! This is meant to be nasty and thats where the fun starts! You can very easily and realisticly turn a A.I car by just clipping this rear end. The cars are not welded to the ground like in DIRT Rally RallyCross! So are you, you can BE turned very easily! So much fun, try it yourself, you wont regret!!\n\nAll in all i must say this game has the potential to be the successor or Richard Burns Rally (RBR). I am very impressed by the physics. If they/you fix the obove mentioned problems SLRE might be the next "big thing" in the rally simulator world!\n\nThanks for reading :)","February 5","true","26.3"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","19","27","0","0"

It is much better than in previous Milestone WRC games, let alone awful WRC 5. It isn't very complicated but it lets me powerslide around corners like real rally drivers even using gamepad. But dynamics are realistic, i.e. you have to brake early, especially in slippery conditions. For some reason only a few rally games has got such immersive handling.\nTracks are also great, they are using lots of elevation changes, scenery is quite diverse and dangerous too. And for all the purists there they are narrow as hell. But thankfully Pikes Peak lets you breathe freely.\nNo need to explain how comprehensive car list is - go check it out yourself.\nCareer mode is pretty large and it returns to the formula of multitude of small events in different classes seen in WRC 2 and RIDE. "Loeb Experience" is nice addition too.\nIn sum, Sebastien Loeb Rally EVO joins the pantheon of my favorite rally games along with Colin McRae Rally 2.0, Dirt Rally, Richard Burns Rally and Mobil 1 Rally Championship. Milestone finally delivers.","January 31","true","10.1"," 44 of 74 people (59%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","59","44","74","6","3"

While the lack of polish, lack of key features and numerous bugs is initially off-putting, this game does the most essential aspect, the driving, really well. SLRE has a great handling model, and offers a nice variety of vehicles and a quality set of tracks. Racing those narrow, twisty courses is challenging and very intense, yet intuitive.\n\nDriving the rally cars is a lot of fun. On loose surfaces the cars are quite sensitive to weight shifts and you can gleefully throw them around corners. But you have to watch out for high speed corners and for jumps. On tarmac the cars feel planted, but can be easily upset if you are careless (it's hard to recover if you lose traction), and there is good feedback from wheel slip. There are a multitude of surfaces: dry and wet gravel, mud, snow, dry, wet and icy tarmac. They feel naturally distinct and it's a total blast to ride the mixed tracks.\n\nThe FFB is good. You can feel the SAT, torque steer, weight shifts to the front, etc... It's complemented by an effective and unobtrusive bump/suspension feedback.\n\nThe tracks are of great quality. Narrow, meandering, bumpy, with elevation changes and varying surfaces. Each of the 8 locations has 4 tracks (2 long and 2 short) totaling about 31 km, plus the reverse versions. There also are 5 RX tracks + tarmac Pikes's Peak. There is not much weather variety, but the night lighting is well done.\n\nThe career mode is quite varied. It's basically a random collection of races restricted to a vehicle or vehicle class. Besides Rally, RX and Hillclimb, there are a few other somewhat gimmicky game modes. Then there are the Loeb related events: you can unlock some cars and learn about the champion's career.\n\nThere are a few disappointments. Given the lack of communication from the developers it's possible they will never be addressed.\nNO FOV adjustment! The dash camera is okay (except for the Stratos and Alpine).\nLazy H transmission model. No need for the clutch to shift (can't stall or miss a shift). Direct H or sequential on a group B is sacrilege!\nSounds are mediocre. Co-driver, tarmac wheel slip and some cars are okay. Surface sounds are pretty basic but informative. Some cars sound like vaccuum cleaners. There are a few annoying audio glitches.\nCo-driver is at times suicidal. Some tight corners are grossly misslabelled; no 1s or squares in the lexicon. Some calls are very late. Some tightening corners are announced but not labelled. Basically be very attentive to "tightens", "caution", any turn "3" and lower, crests, and look ahead! Torsby 2 has no French co-driver.\nGraphics are okay, but a bit lifeless. There are some really low-quality effects (windshield cracks, water/dust splashes), and I've experienced popping objects and graphical glitches. Bad windshield reflections or dust makes some cars nearly undrivable at night or in some of the shady forest sections. Graphical options are very limited and only accessible via a game launcher.\nThe damage model is basic. The headlights are indestructible. Collision sounds are laughable and often absent, and collisions sometimes lack sense of momentum.In some ways the game is a perfect complement to Dirt Rally. SLRE lacks the polish and all the key features that DR has, but offers a better handling model and twice the content.\n\nNow for the sake of bookkeeping here are a few of the most annoying bugs/deficiencies.\nVery limited multi-controller support; mr. Loeb uses a HANDbrake not a button.\nAlmost all options (buttons, FFB, transmission, HUD, co-driver, etc...) need to be changed before the race.\nNo wheel centering on restart\nNo gauge/HUD on countdown, defaults to N gear\nLoeb event car unlocks, some career car classes and wheel rotation "soft-lock" are bugged.\nUsing the H-transmission makes all vehicles have 6 gears.","May 1","true","88.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

They also need to better optimise their games to run on both consoles and PC, because right now they're pretty bad.\n\nThe content cannot be faulted. Although some of the car models are inaccurate, the sheer variety of both cars and events are second to none in rally games. They've done a great job there, but maybe focussed a little too much on quanitity over quality.\n\nUntil these things are addressed, (which haven't been since their first WRC title), DiRT Rally will remain at the top for quality, but that doesn't mean you should skip this title.","January 31","true","12.4"," 32 of 53 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","32","53","2","0"

Look below, there is a resolution FIX out (21:9).\n\nThe DEMO runs not very well. I turned all to low with all settings disabled. Better go for the main-game and use Steam refund, if you do not like the game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=613352014\n\nIn use is here a G27 rev + TH8 RS & a x360 pad with my i5 4670 @ 4.00ghz, 8gb RAM and a 770 4gb. 2x AA, adaptive sync @1920x1080. Auto track tex, reflections + ai cars low. Motion blur off. The rest is max. Absolute playable. Sometimes i have light frame drops on Finland, Australia and Wales. Rallycross races with Ai are not well optimized, bad slow-downs 45-55fps.\n\nThe steering feels very good with my controls. Direct without lags.  Decent G27 ffb - not too much, not too less. Only pad driving with external view is too sensitive for me.\nGood physic, the grip is decent on the different surfaces and the best plus in SLRE are the stages! There is not one crappy rally-stage in this game. I liked them all with good diversity of stage-lengths! PLUS with at least one dlc comes Pikes Peak gravel in your hands!\nAlso this game has a nice feature to save your life-time: Rewind to learn faster the tracks. You can use it, but you must NOT dear "purists"!\n\nDamage present. Experienced flat tires, tire explosions, broken steering & broken transmission.\n\nThe GFX are decent with good details. Missing here some environmental interactions: animals + raging spectators ;) Game comes with snow, rain and night stages. The sense of speed is great imo. Best rally-feeling i immerse with the dashboard-cam on almost all cars (Alpine dash sux). Cockpit-view feels a bit too narrow specially on some Wales stages @1080p. Lets hope for a FOV-patch.  For better gfx-experience i miss manual wipers to clean the windshield. The after some time limited view is very annoying!\n\nThe ancient SOUNDS don´t rock - not good. "Best" sounds I feel onboard in the Subaru and few FORD cars. Co-driver guides are fine with a lot of infos.\n\nStart your engine and try it out by yourself!

I love RBR and I love Dirt : Rally.\n\nAll that said I don't hate SLRE. I actually quite like it.\n\nOK, So...\n\nIt's not actually a terrible game. The lower class cars feel weird, and have lots of wheel slip during acceleration which makes them understeer like a pig and as a result feel somewhat heavy and clunky.\n\nOnce you get to the WRC categories (particularly from the 2003 cars onwards) you can tells theres some real depth to the physics there SOMEWHERE. Cars feel speedy, have appropriate grip levels and behaviour becomes predictable and actually enjoyable. You can man handle them and slide them and really power through some of the super narrow courses (love that btw). The problem is it's hidden behind some god awful wheel force feedback.\n\nThe tracks themselves vary from 'alright' to 'amazing' visually, in some cases some of the tracks look and feel actually more challenging than DIRT:Rally!\n\nAgain however, you've got to look past the god awful FFB.\n\nOccassional issues with the loading bar completing but the game not advancing. It doesn't crash per say, it just doesn't finish loading either.\nGame seems to forget what the default controls setup should be too, not sure if its picking one based on what you press first (wheel, controller or keyboard) rather than what you selected last time in the options.\n\nOnly major complaint I have is the audio. It's terrible all round.\n\nIt's so frustrating, there is a potential fantastic game waiting to come out of this and I really hope Milestone make some real effort to provide post launch support for this. It deserves it and I'd really like to see them do something similar to what CM did whereby they got a experienced gamer/driver with knowledge of how the wheel should react to guide them on how to go about fixing the FFB.","February 4","true","8.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

It feels like a real labour of love with tons of effort put into it, but it's clear that it isn't a huge budget game and that shows in some cases. Definitely an enjoyable game and will last a long time, though.","February 1","true","15.9"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","21","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/avavii/recommended/355060/","avavii","AvaVII","http://steamcommunity.com/id/avavii/","242 products in account","Our script of the video... better watch that and set the fps to 60 for the video.. unlike in the game :(\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbTP5PBItnE\n\nScript:\n\nSebastien Loeb Rally Evo is a pain in the ♥♥♥ on the PC. You can see us playing it here, like this, and this, and here like this and even like this. And most of the time we had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ experience with it. The effort that went into the development of the pc version must have been close to none. But we found some settings, that worked for us in the end. Time for a PC Master Race Reality Check.\n\nIn order to keep input lag as minimal as possible and unlock the framerate, we usually don’t play games with v-sync enabled. Unfortunately Sebastien Loeb Rally Evo becomes a visual mess as soon as players don’t sync their frames. Constant stuttering, lockups, frame drops and spikes get in the way of controlling the cars. As you can see in the footage: the game is almost unplayable like this. It’s such a mess.\n\nSo we thought, okay let’s try to enable v-sync and cut frames at 60 then, but guess what? The game continues to stutter regularly. We were facing frustrating circumstances.\n\nNext we tried out the PS4 version with the first patch being installed. We wanted to know which sweetspot developer Milestone chose for the console. After recording and analyzing some footage and noticing some minor input lag we concluded, that the PS4 version ran at 30 frames per second with v-sync enabled. Along the way we encountered some minor frame drops during replays and races at night as well as other technical issues like fading objects at the side of the road and missing sound effects. But after all: the PS4 version was at least working and fun to play. From what we hear the Xbox One version has way more framerate problems. For our testing we were limited to the PC and the PS4 though.\n\nSo we went back to the pc port, opened up the barebones graphical options for the game and set the sync to half. On 60Hz displays this option limits the framerate to 30 and voila: We reconstructed a Playstation-like experience on our PC. At least the game was starting to be playable. The stuttering was gone completely, but we were still unhappy with the input lag, that naturally occurs by enabling V-Sync. Here you can see the PC version with and without V-Sync side by side. The in game wheel movement matches our inputs 1:1 without V-Sync.\n\nAs a last resort we gave FreeSync a shot and finally prevailed. The inputs are not as good as they could be without any syncing, but as you can see: the input lag is minimal and our Eizo monitor did a good job keeping the jumping framerate in check. Like this we definitely preferred the slightly better looking pc version over the console version.\n\nApart from getting the game working in a playable fashion we also have some other bad news: Triple monitor setups or Ultrawide resolutions are not supported at all. Playing the game in 4K on the other hand is possible, but it takes a heavy toll on your  framerates. Even on our high end build featuring a Geforce GTX 980 Ti we went as high as 1440p for the maximum resolution. Our racing wheel, the Thrustmaster T500 RS was detected and worked well. It has to be noted that playing SL Rally Evo with a wheel additionally reduces input lag, because players can turn the wheel as fast as they want to. Playing with the pad, the turning animation of the virtual driver has to be finished first.\n\nAnd that’s it. We put a lot of research and work into this episode, because the game underneath the technical mess is by far the best Milestone has produced to date. We enjoy the driving, the track layouts, the campaign and many different parts of the game. But as it stands we at least have to put up a huge warning sign for this game. Depending on your hardware with the 30fps lock, FreeSync or GSync the PC Master Race still enjoys the best version of the game in the end.","February 8","true","8.4"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

Well, coming from Dirt Rally, a great rally game in it's own right, I was certainly skeptical going into this one. The demo didn't really work well with my control setup and I wasn't stoked on the menu system and having to exit the race to adjust your controls.\n\nThe narrator has a funny voice. I guess the american language version of the game isn't quite up to the english version, but sometimes you get random voiceovers glitching in so you can hear what you're missing every once in a while.\n\nSetting up the controls is a huge pain, because there is no support for multiple inputs. Meaning, you can't have a separate USB handbrake work at the same time as your wheel. My TH8A shifter works with my Thrustmaster wheel and T3PA pedals, thank goodness, but it really is a setback not being able to use my handbrake and button panel.\n\nHaving said that, once you DO get your controls set up as best as you can, the game is a lot of fun. There is lots of fun in unlocking things and earning money in the game to graduate through the world championships or whatever this game calls it. ALSO, going through Seb's carreer is also pretty cool.  Though the framerate can be bad and there are a bunch of funny glitches (random navigator language change mid race, lol) It's really a lot of fun. Especially the RallyCross section, which I think actually does better than dirt, though the lack of a guy in your ear is sort of a letdown.\n\nTL;DR: Not Dirt Rally, but a fun almost-sim in it's own right. This game has the best rallycross of all of the rally games I've played. If you get it on sale, it can be a fun time.\n","February 25","true","20.5"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

No it´s not perfect, but neither is Dirt Rally, or Assetto Corsa, both of which I own.\nRealism? Come on... I am not a real world race driver, nor rally driver. I am in these games to be entertained - and, SLRE does that just fine.\n\nOnly thing that bothers me, is that I cannot exit the game. When I do, it still is listed as "Running" and I cannot start another game, or even close Steam, because SLRE is running. I have to go to tast manager and find it there and kill it. PLEASE fix that.\n\nBut part from that, I am plenty entertained by this Rally game.\n\n12. February review update:\n\nNow I have 22 hours in the SLRE, and I am enjoying myself more than ever. I see a LOT of people complaining, that have ½, or 1 or 2 hours in it (but also some who have a lot more, I admit) but please give it a little effort before raving it down. Seems like a lot of folks made their minds up about it, long before trying it out. That´s s pity I think.\n\nBut never mind them - I think the game is great - I cannot say else, because I seem to choose this game over both WCR4, WCR5, Dirt Rally and the likes...

For the size of the developer this game is great!  It's best played with three monitors and My Fanatec gear works flawlessly.  I don't like the fact that it can't support my handbrake but I work around it by assigning my sequential shifter as the handbrake and use paddles for shifts.  Adding this feature would drastically help immersion of the game and improve its status to a true sim.  There are three simple reasons to get this game:\n\n1. Amazing tarmac feel and rally stages\n2. Best weight feel of the car out of any rally sim\n3. Weight transfer feel when braking.  You actually have to slow down when approaching a corner, unlike other rally sims, and not because you are sliding, but because you can feel the weight of the car either causing a slide or shifting the car out of balance.  This is very unique to this game and has helped my driving in other sims as a result.\n\nI used to be all for Richard Burns rally, but I would rate this game second to Dirt Rally, and RBR third.","April 16","true","79.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Under the hood is a rally sim that combines qualities of the legendary Richard Burns Rally (RBR) and Dirt Rally.  I hated this title after its initial release.  The demo was aweful and reminded me of Milestones checkered past.  They've polished it into a very satisfying rally sim and I find myself playing this more than anything else now.  The physics are very much like RBR and outshines Dirt Rally in this regard.  Much more challenging once you get your wheel setting correct.  The variety in cars and locations is great and the damage model is very good.  Again, this feels like RBR in many ways.  The only thing it needs is a sound tweak and it would be perfect.  Much more forgiving than Dirt Rally in some ways.

The tracks are also just a little too narrow except the Pike Peak Track which the Drive model actually suits. It means you spend a vast amount of time off the track as the cars spin around too easily.\nI urge you to try the PC Demo first as you need to try this before you buy. Not a long term play!\nOnly for the die hard fans who play every rally game to its end. 5 out of 10 Good Scenery and tracks bad handling!

But is a very good rally game..\nThe good of the game is the flexibility who makes it from a total sim game to an arcade game so only for than i vote yes, but if the problems doen't resovles quick then i get it to no, i don't suggest the game.

What right do I have to review the game from that, you might think.\n\nI do not have 30 minutes of playtime. I have had 30 minutes of trying to get the game to work properly, before I gave up.\n\nEverything seems top notch, from what I've read and seen from the game. I like the graphics style better than competing rally titles, the sounds are actually good, the stages are varied, narrow and realistic, the car selection is awesome, it has some small, but nice costumisation options, the career mode is extensive and interesting. Just to name some of the good things about this game.\n\nThe car handling and physics I cannot say much about, because I'm not able to actually play the game the way it's meant. But from what I can tell, it actually feels much better than Milestone's last effort, WRC4, and it might very well hit the sweet spot between harsh realism and forgiving arcade-style driving. But I wouldn't know for sure, because it has too many game breaking bugs.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, because it has so much good going for it. But it is unplayable:\n\n-Graphics options are a joke, and it's impossible to configure the game to run smoothly without having to disable all the three(!) quality options available, on a system that runs most games at 60 fps on high settings.\n\n-Configuring custom controllers is a nightmare. Want to have multiple controllers or external shifter? Forget it. Want to map some functions to your keyboard? No can do. And my G27 is stuck at 180 degrees no matter what I do. It works in all other games, but not this.\n\n-The menu actually stopped responding a couple of times (in 30 minutes!) and I had to kill the game from task manager.\n\n-The game has no FOV or seat adjustment sliders, neither does it have the option to remove the steering wheel from cockpit view. Triple screen support I don't know, because I have only a single screen.\n\nIf Milestone can present a game that actually works, this could be one of the best rally games ever. But in its current state, it's mostly unplayable. If you've been told that the demo doesn't do the game justice, it actually does - the full version is just as bad.\n\nI'm getting a refund.\n\nBut I'll gladly buy the game back if Milestone can make it work.","February 8","false","0.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Just a few exampels:\n1: There is NO feeling of reality, what so ever. The game screams Archade miles away\n2: The graphics is so poor and un real, one might mistake it for a 10 year old game\n3: Forget the possibilities to adjust a wheel properly, and even if you could, it would still suck\n4: Not enough cars available and no way to skip the ♥♥♥♥ boxes you have to drive in chapion ship-mode\n\nI could for sure think of other reasons why I think it sucks, but then I would have to start up the game, and THAT will never happen again!\n\n","May 8","false","7.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

The cars are modeled well and the stages are a fair representation of their locations, with plenty of detail.\n\nOn the audio side of things, the game doesn't quite hit the mark - the Co-driver is competent enough and delivers the pace-notes admirably, but the engine sounds and other effects aren't the greatest.\n\nThe amount of content in the single-player portion of the game is immense and offers dozens of hours of play-time, with a large and well conceived career mode being the main focus.\n\nAgain, I can't recommend this game highly enough - it really is a brilliant rally game.\n\nMilestone should be proud of what they've achieved here and SLRE deserves to be recognised as the fantastic game it is.","February 2","true","57.8"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","12","28","3","0"
