Can't adjust audio ingame.\n- Outlines of the towers doesnt match with the lines of the enemy wave.\n- There was a weird thing going on with the targetting of the towers.\n- Camera is only from one point\n- To make things worse, the mouse sensitivity was through the roof and because the lack of an options/settings menu, you couldn't adjust that ingame!\n- Overlap of the text of the Cost of an upgrade and the upgrade button itself. Both were hardly readable.\n","May 31","false","0.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

The graphics are ok if hastily done, but the animations are fairly glitchy, and the primary challenge I experienced in my admittedly brief go at this game came from not being able to figure out how my tower AI was choosing its targets. It could also use better translation, but it's good enough to understand so I really don't count that as a problem per se.","May 31","false","0.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"
