He was the first superhero comic I ever picked up as a kid. I own more Spiderman comic books than any other series in my collection and have been reading them for eighteen years (5 yrs-23 yrs). I've also played every single Spiderman video game since back in the early 90's and i'm here to tell you...\n\nI went out on launch day to buy this game for PS3.  I beat it with my brother in law after only two sessions of playing - about 8 hours total. Mind you I was playing around a lot of that time and just exploring the city. I thought maybe I was just too hype on the game and it didn't meet my expectations...So I decided to give it another go on the PC.\n\nNow keep in mind this is an open world game, but there is little to nothing to do! The city just doesn't feel like a real complete city. I still play the older titles and compared to this they all have way more to do and a lot more diversity in their levels, which is sad considering you're supposed to progress. Almost every single main mission takes place somewhere underground. Which at first is real cool...until you realize all of the missed potential that's just sitting there above you. Laughing at you. Mocking you. There are a few missions above ground but they are seldom.\n\nThere are plenty of side missions - Like crimes to solve which are inanely repetitive and overtly mundane, nothing like they used to be. I'm not even trying to be that guy that's just stuck on the past nostalgia, but if i'm still playing those games today (which I am) over the new titles they're dishing out...somethin' ain't right. Sure the missions in those games were all repetitive too, but at least more diverse and way more fun than "Stop that car!" "Catch that runner!" "Stop that gang!" "Now stop that getaway car!" "Catch that mugger!" "There's a gang on the loose!"\n\nNo matter how you clothe a sheep it is still a sheep.\n\n"Oh, i'm sure that guys being dramatic. I heard there are little collectibles to 100% the game."\n\nYes, you can collect comic book pages to read comics on the game...which is such an awesome concept and to be honest one of the things I spent most time doing, but there are only a few issues and the time it takes to do this isn't really worth the end result. You could cut the time out completely and look up those issues online. However, there are tons of costumes...which are really cool and groovy...but also purely cosmetic, which is like building a really really nice car and never installing an engine. Cool car, bro...but...does it do anything?\n\nDefinitely not worth 39.99 OR the sale price of 27.49 that I am currently writing this review during. If the 27.49 price tag included all DLC and you're a hardcore Spidey fan THEN i'd say it is worth it.\n\nIn other words, do yourself a big favor and pick up any of these Spiderman titles for the PC instead:\n\nSpiderman Web of Shadows (Best Open World Spiderman Game Hands-Down & the Darkest)\nUltimate Spiderman (Best Open World Spiderman Game That Emulates A Live Comic Book)\nSpiderman Shattered Dimensions (Linear Level Design with Refreshing Changes in Gameplay)\nSpiderman 3 (Best Open World of the Movie-Themed)\n\nYE BE WARNED.

Only a person who is really bad at gaming. ...who isn't a real gamer.... has low expectations would love this game. Their is no challenge to it that is the very definition of what a game is the challenge. Since it didn't have a challenge I don't consider this to be a true game. The game is also broken on a technical level. It has glitches, bugs, and will have you restarting your pc or it will just flash out and close itself. Notice the people below who try to discredit me. Some of these people wrote reviews only one hr of playing a game and not completing them. I'm sorry kiddies I was born in the era of NES and Atari and been gaming way longer than you peons. My experience makes me better than you new generation spoonfed gamers where every task is given to you. The AI in this game is dumb. The bosses are all the same and offer no challenge what so ever. They don't learn or do any new strategy from the next.\n\nWhen you look at this game it seems to have potential but looks are decieving. Lets start off with the kick they did to pc gamers as a punishment to not buying the game on console, and waiting for pc. So instead of snapping 7 spider signals to get the suits you are made to collect 700 comics, and complete tasks. You get most of the new suits when beating the game. Its like why after that.\nThe suits also offer no stat differences or powers.\n\nTechnical issues. Aside from webbing through the city, running up walls, and climbing them is a glitchfest, the webbing doesn't feel as fun as in past spiderman games. It also feels inorganic and articficial as you can just hold bottom R trigger to keep webbing. You'll be using the first r1 button because its more responsive and accurate. This also has its flaw as the indicator to where your travelling is only slightly more golden or yellowish.\n\nThe game constantly crashes on you. No bug fixes or patched have yet to be released. Making the game even more painful to play through its glitchness and instability.  People with rigs like mine that are up to date, and high end memory, and gpu's have had the similar painstaking problems, I have had. If I wasn't a power user I swear the ordinary user must have a real bad day troubleshooting this piece of hellborn spawn. The lack of support for this game, and no more added content, plus all the problems make it a no buy. Until they fix all the problems and make it playable I do not recommend buying this game.\nIts a shame Marvel let this bad pc port over like this without testing it fully, and fixing it up.\n\nAll of us Spiderman fans are waiting for all the other games to come to PC. Marvel you're losing money not investing, and properly investing in us.\n\nAgain it looks decent, but no because it doesn't function properly. My biggest complaint comes with they came out with dlc fast but not with the patches the games needs so drastically.\n\nJust look at these Steam Forums\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/212580/discussions/0/864951657868730063/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/212580/discussions/0/864947149145868507/\n\n\nThoughts after finishing the game. It still is a mess. The controls are bad, the story is lack luster,\nand the boss battles are repetitive, and feel like a cluster of organized randomness. They did not port this at all well for pc, and never fixed any bogs, released patches. It could have been a great game, but all of these combined make it a fail of a choice. You won't regret buying this particular spiderman game trust me. The games combat system is super easy, and you will get to it too quickly. People who have no gaming skill will love this very easy game filled with glitches.","January 18, 2014","false","37.5"," 375 of 535 people (70%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","70","375","535","7","13"

Spider-man controls smoothly and combat can feel very satisfying with striking from behind, retreating to the ceiling, and then quickly moving to a new spot to strike again.\nThe open world (Manhattan) is nicely detailed and is filled with collectables so you always have something to do while web-slinging from mission to next mission or random crime event.\n\nUnfortunately there are a lot of points where Amazing 1 stops being fun. Despite Spider-Man's strengths lying in jumping away and being able to use high ceilings to his advantage a lot of the missions put you in a tiny, enclosed space where this is not possible so you have to rely on the combat. The combat tries to be Arkham with combos and smooth flowing from one enemy to the next, but this doesn't always work.\n\nThe web-slinging isn't as nice as it could be either, which I think is mainly due to the game's locked FOV. You simply lose track of where you are headed. When I first started playing this and got to Manhattan, I actually got a bit nauseous at first until I got more used to it. Fortunately there is an alternative by web-rushing using the R2 bumper everywhere, which basically automatically picks a good spot to get to.\n\nAnd then there's the absolute biggest issue... the game is horribly optimised. It crashes at least once each half hour for no good reason, and while the game does autosave, you can get unlucky enough to have this occur during a boss fight so you have to redo a part of the level and the fight again.\n\nVoice acting is okay, not good but not cringe-worthy either, and graphics are passable.\n\nIf you can pick this up for less than €/$ 10, I'd recommend it. Skip the DLC though, that's all based on more combat and therefore not really fun.\nIt does NOT get a recommendation at its current full price of %/$ 30 or even the 50% discount which is still up as I write this.","June 21, 2015","true","29.6"," 54 of 60 people (90%) found this review helpful 66 people found this review funny","90","54","60","66","1"

I really do not think it is worth more than that and I will tell you why.\n\nFirst the bad...\n\nThis game crashes a lot. This is well known at this point and all of the "fixes" that have been discussed simply did not work for me. I am a Windows 10 user, and I have a system that has 32gb of memory and a 4gb GTX 980. Even with those specs, my game would crash usually after about an hour to an hour and a half of play. It made no difference what you were doing in game, and It made no difference what changes you made to the exe file or system settings. Personally, I believe that the game has some sort of memory leak/issue as the more you play, the more graphical glitches you will encounter. My system defaults to the highest settings for the game and I could play for about 45 minutes with no noticeable graphical issues, but after that time it really became a game of chance as to what would happen. Usually, you would see flickering textures on sky scrapers or Spidermans eyes during game play and as both of these surfaces are mirrored it leads me to believe that the game has a rendering issue that ties in to memory. The longer you play, these textures have less resources to use and so it becomes corrupted. After all, you are swinging through a pretty large world space and even with frequent level breaks, you are asking your machine to render a lot of mirrored surfaces on a pretty quick timescale as you play. I got to the point where I would set a timer and at 45 mins I would prepare to close the game down and restart it. This ensured that I had minimal graphical issues and I saw less frequent crashes as I was "flushing" out the memory as I played. Basically, do not buy this game if you have zero patience when it comes to crashes.\n\nSecondly, some of the sidequests and boss fights are pretty repetitive. It is great that they have given you smaller crimes to help with, but at times you feel like you are spending all of your time doing the same things. What is worse is that there is no real variation at all in these crimes either. If you take a car chase mission, you will see the same car in every car chase mission after that as well. Basically, the car is always an Orange and Black car. A little texture variation would have gone a long way. The mechanics for the missions are always the same as well. Once you know how to complete it, you can pretty much do every mission that is the same in less than a minute afterwards which leads them to feel like they are just time wasters. Some of the (secondary) boss fights are the same as well. There is a set pattern to defeat them and once you know it, every one of the secondary bosses can be beaten quickly and with ease.\n\nThirdly, the animations can be annoying at times too. Swinging through the city is as easy as holding down a button *which is a little bit of a let down) and spidey will do a somersault after every swing. He will either flip sideways, or head over heels. This is okay some of the time, but at others it just seems way over the top and ostentatious. The real annoyance for me here was that when you are swinging with someone on your back, you still do these annoying somersaults. This makes zero sense, especially when you are transporting a sick or injured person. It is also really annoying to hear one of these people pleading for you to go slower and suddenly hear spiderman shout "yeahhhh!" as he does a triple somersault flip with the poor soul clinging to his back. It really makes him looks like a bit of a jerk to be honest. As far as the swinging goes as well, when you apprehend a mental patient or criminal, they too hold on to you the same way as a sick or injured person which just looks silly. Why would they willingly climb on to your back with no restraints so you can take them to jail? A little animation of spidey tying them up would have been nice.\n\nThat being said, here is the good...\n\nThe story itself is a pretty good one. It is set immediatleuy after the events of the first Andrew Garfield film and it follows on quite nicely. As an original story, I think they did a very good job of giving you a serious conflict to resolve as well as allowing you to get a feel of being Spiderman. The game and graphics arent as polished as some other Superhero games (like the Batman Arkham series) but what they do offer is a good effort of utilising modern day shaders on an older texture setup. The City as well is pretty well done, and there is the constant hustle and bustle of New York going on beneath you as you swing from skyscraper to skyscraper to get from A to B. You can get from one side of the map to the other pretty quickly, but there is pretty much always a reason to take a detour thanks to the constant side quests that pop up on every level. The side missions can get a bit samey, but there is a pretty good variety as there are police shootouts, car chases, mental patients and sick people who need to get to the hospital, smaller infected bosses that are usually in a sewer somewhere, photography missions, Oscorp Lab takedowns and some timetrial challenges to partake in. There is quite a lot to keep you busy as you play, and it took me approx 11 hours to complete all side quests (except for the time trials) and the main story. I managed to unlock 7 of the spiderman suits as I played which also gave me some variation as I progressed. It is nice to have the option to change suit too as you will find your current suit is regularly torn to shreds as you take damage, and if you are like me you like to look your best as you fight crime!\n\nAs I said at the start, I do recommend buying this game but not at the full price listed on Steam. I would recommend it being worth no more than £7.99/$9.99 as it is a game that has a lot of issues and until the developer or Steam fixes those issues, it will never be worth the £24.99 they are listing it as. I played this game as a casual superhero fan and I did enjoy the story and game despite some repetitive gameplay. Buy it if you have low expectations and I think you will enjoy it.","March 28","true","18.4"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","46","51","6","0"

Developed by Beenox and published through Activision, it found its way on Windows, X-Box 360, Playstation 3, Nintendo DS & 3DS, Wii & Wii U, iOS and Android.\n\nThe story is based a few months after the events from The Amazing Spider-Man movie and can be hold as an alternate epilogue to it. Yet, it is not necessary to watch the film, in order to follow the story from the game.\nIt starts with Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, who sneak into the restricted areas of Oscorp. Gwen has suspicions that the company still works on so-called Cross-Species, virus-mutated humans with special powers, after Dr. Curt Connors became „The Lizard“, who sits now in a mental facility. Both get caught eventually by Alastairs Smythe, who does not deny the work on the cross-species, just for a little longer until they all will be destroyed, as he says. Since Peter Paker is a cross-species himself, all of the other still contained species react to him, become insane in their behavior and manage to break out of Oscorp. The virus, which these species carry inside, is highly infectious when bitten and so the virus spreads around Manhattan. It is up to Spider-Man to rescue the whole inhabitants of Manhattan, bring justice to Oscorp and of course to find an Antidote. Dr. Connors could be a help to develop an Antidote and so Spider-Man has no choice but giving him assistance to break out the facility. With Connors on his back, Spider-Man is on his way into his apartment and so a race against time begins.\n\nGameplaywise, The Amazing Spider-Man has to offer a lot, as expected from an open world game. From RPG elements to endless swinging, everyone will get their money worth. While being outside Peter's apartment, the player can either continue with his main missions or help the citizens of Manhattan. For this purpose Spider-Man owns an „Osphone“, which he obtained from Gwen in Oscorp. The map of Manhattan is accessible through this device, where also main and side missions can be found. If one of the points is selected on the map, a red beam appears somewhere in the city, showing up the accurate location. Side missions can be for example beating down thiefs/bullies, helping the police to catch criminals, locate and investigate hidden places and so on. If the player is not tired after completing all of them, he can go on a comic collection hunt; 700 pages in number have to be found. Some of them are placed in the city, some of them in each main level. They can easily be spotted through their golden shine and sparkling sound. After progress in the game, Spider-Man will get a camera, with which he has to take pictures about suspicious events. However, all of these side missions are optional and contain additional experience points.\nSpeaking of which, experience points are used to strengthen Spider-Man's Skills. A hurricane made with webs or being able to stealth kill two enemies at once sounds like fun, right? And damn, it is. With every new skill -11 in number-, Spider-Man is even more fun to play and offers new ways to battle against the foes. And as if this is not enough, there are also so-called Tech-Upgrades, mechanical tweaks for his web shooters. Unlike the normal skills, the player needs to collect scrap pieces in order to upgrade them. Rapid fire will teach the enemies the meaning of fear, wall blast sticks them at the nearest wall and much more.\nMain missions are the common threads. The game is segmented in 12 different, but connected chapters, including a 13th chapter to roam around or finish bypassed side quests. Inside the apartment from Spider-Man the player has the choice to replay any mission he wants. A special feature that might be worth mentioning is the possibility to change the Spider-Man outfit. They can be unlocked by different tasks inside the missions, such as „Find all comic papers“ or „Finish the game on the highest difficulty“. A list which skins are available and how to unlock them can be found here.\nThat being said, The Amazing Spider-Man contains so much additional side missions that players can easily fill around 20 or more hours.\n\nThe controls have their ups and downs and show shamelessly straight, that this game is a console port. It is highly recommended to play with a controller, since keyboard and mouse feel very clunky and unfinished. However, when played with a controller, Spider-Man's skill to swing, jump and crawl all over the place turns out to be very enjoyable.\n\nWhen it comes to the graphics, The Amazing Spider-Man shows its prettiness. Manhattan's streets, sewers and interior of buildings look very detailed and the day and night cycle with the varying ambient lighting effects are truly well made and even after around 4 years pleasant to look at. The different suits do look stunning on the highest graphic options, including even minor details such as small pimples all over the suits and in-depth shadows to show of Spider-Man's muscles. Definitely nothing to sneeze at, considered its age.\n\nUnfortunately, this shiny coin is not as golden as the player might think by now. The Amazing Spider-Man suffers from a tremendous game breaking bug: Random Crashes. There is no known source why these crashes appear and with that no known fix for everyone. Some found a downloadable fix, some reported that turning off Anti-Aliasing helped. There are a lot of tweaks around the internet but none of them are the very one everyone is searching for. A huge letdown for an amazing game like this.\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man is one of the better games that contains a famous hero and connects itself to the end of a movie. The huge content spiked with RPG elements and an interesting combat system known from the Batman games, fills hours of hours with fun, if it would not crash so frequently. Still, for those who can stand this problem will find themselves slinging and crawling around in The Amazing Spider-Man!\n\nRecommended when on sale.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nFor this review I played through the game a second time and did not get tired of it. RPG elements are always something I love to see in games and the spider-like acrobatic skills from Spider-Man made the game even more enjoyable. I caught myself very often, that I just swung around Manhattan without any objective or mission selected. Purchase on sale and have a lot of fun!\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n[✔] Highly detailed graphics\n[✔] Great storyline with many side quests\n[✔] RPG elements (leveling up, upgrading skills, unlockable suits)\n\n[✖] Crashes often, nVidia & AMD likewise (no prober fix for everyone available)\n[✖] Crawling on walls from time to time disorienting\n[✖] Controls clunky, when played with keyboard and mouse (controller recommended)\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ MEDIA]▬▬▬▬▬●https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukT1r-eknXg\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up!

This game will get you flying through the streets of Manhattan with cool acrobatics which Spider-Man is mostly about for me. You can unlock different costumes after a while, but after completing the game I had only unlocked about 3 out of 6 or so.\n\nIt also has a good story but reveals something that most likely will come in the new movie.\n\nAfter the story is completed you can still swing around in the city and save citizens from small crime, or just swing around for fun and listen to the epic Spider-Man music.\n\nHowever there are some things that I did not like about this game.\nWhen you swing around in the city, it doesn't seem like the web is hitting any of the buildings, it goes straight up into the air. Which I think is really sad and lazy beacause I remember a Spider-Man game back in the day on PS2 where the web actually hit the buildings and you had to swing in a different way because of the way the web hit the building. This game kind of goes back to PS1 where the web just goes straight up, but you still gotta swing where there are buildings close to you of course.\n\nMost of the combat and missions happen inside sewers and buildings, which doesn't give you such a great feeling of being Spider-Man, very few missions are outside. Most of the game is spent inside something.\n\nBut even though I got some negative things to say about this game, I would still recommend it (although it's pretty easy).\nIt gives you the feeling of being The Amazing Spider-Man. I had fun completing this game, and I would play it again if I had forgotten the whole story.","November 25, 2013","true","9.9"," 128 of 202 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","128","202","0","2"

I can almost handle the checkpoint save system (typical console port), but to combine it with crashes is unforgiveable.  Also, as you will read on the forums, the game suffers from poor performance.  It's not a matter of how good your hardware is, it's a matter of how poorly the optimizations were done in the port.  In fact, the performance problems are so bad that it takes a fast reaction scenario and turns it into an unplayable mess.  If it were not for Spider-Man's ability to slow time, some of the fights would be frustratingly unwinnable.

After the events of the movie, Alistair Smythe takes over the cross-species experiments when Curt Connors is taken to a mental hospital. Things eventually go wrong and cross-species creatures such as Vermin, Scorpion and Rhino break out of OsCorp and into the city. The cross-species contaminate the city and it becomes Spider-Man's mission to find a cure with the help of Connors.\nThe game does an amazing job of making the player really feel like Spider-Man. Swinging around Manhattan looks gorgeous, despite the fact that there is no Spider-Man 2 style web swinging, the web lines just sort of stick to nothing.\nThe combat in this game is very good. It is a more basic version of Batman Arkham series' combat system. There is a designated attack button, jump and web moves are available. Once your combo reaches a certain number and an enemy is in a dazed state, you can do a signature move which automatically KO's them and usually involves some acrobatics and webbing.\nA problem is that it is quite repetitive at times. Quite a lot of the time, it is much easier to stealth take down any enemies than to get into an actual fight, and if you’re spotted, you can web rush around a little until the enemies lose sight of you and then try again.\nThe levels in the game are fun. However the game suffers from a lack of different environments. The main missions take place in a few areas that look a lot alike. All the major missions take place indoors. Almost all side missions take outdoors. Side missions include beating up muggers, challenges, car chases and photo missions. The boss battles are ok.\nOverall, the graphics look good. Some of the character models look strange, but it is only noticeable if you are talking to them. Enemies look good. The city looks great especially in the night. Spidey's different costumes all look very nice.\nThe Amazing Spider-Man is a slightly above average attempt at taking a movie and making a game adaptation. The free roam, which should be a staple feature in a Spider-Man game is fun and can be quite addictive when getting down to collectibles and the camera angle used makes for some breathtaking web swinging moments.\nThe Amazing Spider-Man would be amazing if the game would be a little less repetitive and would have real web-swinging.\n\nSounds 8/10\nGraphics 8/10\nGameplay 7/10\nAtmosphere 8/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","March 24, 2014","true","22.3"," 53 of 82 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","53","82","2","0"

The city lacks in detail, level textures aren't always that good but the characters were quite well made and the animations and moves of Spider-Man were pretty good.\n\nControls felt good and the swinging and fighting was fluent, although the camera angle had it's issues sometimes.\nYou can compare the combat to the Batman Arkham games. It's a combo-system with a lot of different moves, finishers, stealth-takeouts etc.\n\nThe game is split into story-missions / side-missions and free-roaming in the city.\nThe main missions are very linear, with some secrets you can find and collect. While in the free-roaming mode, you can swing around the city and start side-missions, rescuing citizens and look for collectibles. There is not much else to do in the city, you basically just swing from side-mission to side-mission and (if you're into that) get all the collectibles if you can.\nBut swinging around as Spider-Man is pretty fun :)\n\nUnfortunately, i had constant crashes every hour or so. I couldn't find out why it happend nor fix them, so that was pretty annoying but the good thing was, save-points are pretty fair, so i didn't needed to play a lot again.\nI had also a few glitches/bugs, especially later on in the game, which forced me to restart as i was stuck.\n\nApart from the crashes and glitches, i still had a lot of fun with it, but due to these, i can't really recommend it 100%.","August 29, 2015","false","15.5"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","24","31","4","3"

It is everything you expect it should be being Spider-Man and being such a hard-hitting, action and open world game, it really manages to differs from all of it peers at a level on its own.\n\nThe game starts slow and I did thought is that all the game has to offer at first; mindless mouse mashing. Several chapters into the game, it actually expand the content and also combat capabilities. Levels are replayable so you can take your time to explore and complete the collectibles. No pressure there.\n\nYou may need to get used to the camera and mouse and keyboard input capture at first but as you proceed with the game, you will slowly take your mind off them. All in all, this game is really awesome and not just some money-grab to follow the Spider-Man trend.\n\nHowever, all these only applies without the bad hardware support and constant crashes. The game jerks horribly specially in the open world. This is not due to hardware performances. If you just do some research, you will know this game is not compatible with RADEON cards. I tried to resolve the problem without avail since none of the solution does not promise a 100% success rate. The game also constantly crash at random times. Fans has been discussing this issue that seems to occurs to RADEON and NVIDIA users. Most of the solutions provided are again not confirmed as I have tried them all.\n\nIf you really enjoy such open world games, I do highly recommend this title. You will definitely not be disappointed. But it comes with a huge gamble if the game actually worked or not.","February 7","false","5.9"," 29 of 41 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","29","41","3","0"

Not only are the combat and swing mechanics fun and easy to pick up, but the story gets f-ing crazy as well, taking Spiderman to what felt like an apocalypse scenario by the end of it.

I write this review not using the AMD GPU.\n\n\nThis was my first Spider-man game I've played since the PS1 and PS2 versions. I saw this on sale and said why the hell not. I haven't indulged in a Spider-man game for awhile, and I always remember enjoying them.\n\nRight from the start this game brought back all the fun and excitement that I remember from the old. Same simple commands and fast paced third person fighting action.\n\nPros:\n\n-fast paced fighting action with smooth movements and very responsive inputs(very useful while dodging!)\n-simple open-world, not too big, not too small\n-long play time(even on easiest setting)\n-very user friendly phone/map interface\n-enjoyed the "Web-Dash," I'd consider it the "Dead Eye" from Red Dead Redemption but Spider-man style\n-VERY detailed in game info, if you're into that kinda stuff. (I am!) (enemy specs, backgrounds, and info on much more)\n-I very much enjoyed the battle music and the atmosphere music (**Spoiler** When you walk out from the make shift lab, and the desolation you see, with that background music just hits ya in a way that makes you feel just how bad things are.)\n\nBut of course with every game there are issues that I or anyone else may find. So here is what I found wrong.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- One issue I had was when I died, and I went back to the check point, I would move forward again, but get stuck because the coding triggers that I should have set off (like, walk in room and room should be full of robots... but isn't). Mind you I didn't know robots were suppose to come in because I had just got there, so I got stuck looking for an exit for 20 minutes until I got fed up and looked up a walkthrough in which found out that something was wrong with the game, and not me (surprisingly! ;D) This problem occured particularly on the Oscorp Tower 2 portion, so watch out for that.\n\n- The dialogue for civilians you save from muggings don't work very often(say 60% of the time). Their mouths move, but no dialogue. Not that big of an issue, just something I noticed.\n\n- Ok.... Seriously guys? 700 Comic pages!?!? ARE YOU FOR REAL!? Quite possibly the worst attempt to smolder up some sort of replay value. Good lord it took me 14 hours to get 200. And thats going out of my way to missions. I'm almost done with everything, and I'll still have to looks for 500 more... ya good one. Goings from "The Amazing Spider-man," to "Find 500 pieces of paper in New York City!" Pardon my French, but ♥♥♥♥ that.\n\n- So these high speed chases. Think jumping car to car as Spider-man to stop a group of thugs speeding away sounds pretty cool right? Well, it is the first time. And I suppose the second time. But then you start to realize there are about 10 chases, and they have... wait for it... the same guys... in the same car.... and you take them down the same way..... every friggin' time. OH BUT WAIT! Its not the same! The next missions have...! Wait for it... 3 cars to the chase!... but they are the same car, with the same thugs. You just catch them 3 times in one mission. My god wheres the creativity?? At least paint the cars a different color! Or... I don't know... have Spider-man catch them in a different way? There are a lot of options, but I'm not gonna get into them\n\n\n\n\nAnd thats all folks. Overall, I loved the game. Kept my attention, very fun, love sneakin' around as Spidy. Simple semi-linear game. Would I buy it for full price? Hell no. Like people say, the games 2 years old at this point, so $50? Pff. Good one, what do you think you are? Halo? CoD? Lolz but on sale? Sure!\n\n\nAnd for those of you who enjoy a rating.... I give it a 7.14355/10\n\n\nHope this helped!\n\n\n-KOOKIE_SAN","April 9, 2014","true","17.6"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

I did write some things in my head. Now that I am here I kind of don't have anything to say. Let me just list some things see if it sparks something.\n\nFirst things first. I really like Spiderman. So now you know I'm biased but lets get into it.\n\nWhat I didn't like\n- Manhattan is boring. At least in this game it is. It looks boring and it feels boring.\n- Everything looks feels old. The UI looks dated, the city even with the game running at maximum 1080p usually 60fps (the game seems to bog down for seemingly no reason a lot) the city looks dated and the draw distance seems to favor fogginess. Also the button prompts are ridiculous.\n- It launches twice sometimes and crashes because of that (happened like 7 times)\n-There is very little variety in the side missions\n- There are too many collectibles\n\nWhat I did like\n-You get to be Spiderman\n\n\nOkay, I'll say more.\nTraversing around feels great. Now given that Spidy swings on his web that attaches to things thats not always the case here. HOWEVER, in reality the mechanics of that and having to react to that in addition to fighting would be overbearing. The swinging feels great. You are Spiderman. Not, figure out the best trajectory while fighting a giant robot.. man. The fighting feels pretty decent. Its a little over animated but again, you're Spiderman you still need to fight accordingly. Its very responsive and in no way out of your control.\n\nStealth is very fun, you can look through your mask while time is slowed and choose a location to zipline to and prey on your foes very tactical like. You know he can stick to walls and ceilings right? Think about it.\n\nEven though there is not much in the way of side mission variety the things here are fun. Races, petty crimes, helping the police by going behind enemy lines or ending a car chase. Of course there is also taking pictures of crap. I mean, its not like he works at the Daily Bugle or anything. And all of these activities repeat with some variation between the main missions. There is also picking people up (escaped mental patients and infected people) and taking them to the appropriate place. Which is fun because swinging around is friggin awesome.\n\nThere are comic books EVERYWHERE and grabbing them out of the sky is super fun because again getting around very liberating and fluid. Its an absolute joy to snag a collectible and proceed to fall and then swing in between two cars at ground level.\n\nThe voice acting is actually very good which surprised me, then I recognized and looked up to confirm that Nolan North (Nathan Drake and every other male character not voiced by Troy Baker) and Ali Hillis (Liara T'Soni and Lightning from FFXIII) are in the game.\n\nIf you like Spiderman you'll like this game, if you don't, this game won't change your mind. I guess I had more to say than I thought.","August 19, 2015","true","12.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

You can adjust them in a launcher that opens prior to the game starting up.\nIt took me about 20 hours to complete the game (With All Side Missions done and most of the collectibles found If you're powering through the story missions, you're likely looking at around 8 hours of gameplay or so.\nThis is a movie tie-in game with The Amazing Spider-Man reboot movie that came out in 2012. It will spoil signficant plot elements of the first movie if you haven't seen it. However, it does NOT tie-in to the events of the second movie.\nReportedly crashes often; Check out this thread for more information.\nCapped at 60 FPS.\nNot optimized for ATI or AMD Radeon cards. Expect significant stuttering if you have one.\nHas a Stan Lee cameo and optional Stan Lee DLCSo, The Amazing Spider-Man tie-in game is a decent little action-adventure that's fun to play, especially if you haven't had a Spider-Man fix in a while. There's a lot to it, and most of it is handled pretty competently, but in my opinion, it's still not quite as good as the now famous Spider-Man 2 tie-in video game. Still, it's a decent amount of fun, and worth the 10 dollars I spent on it.\n\nNarrative\n\nThe video game follows almost immediately after the events of the first movie, throwing you in the role of the titular Peter Parker,  helping Gwen Stacy inside of Oscorp and watching as teams are dismantling and disposing of Curt Connors' cross-species research. Unfortunately, the mere prescence of Peter causes the mutated cross-species monsters to react extremely violently, eventually breaking out of containment and spreading a lethal, contagious virus among the scientists, and eventually New York.\n\nIt's not a bad premise, and I like the idea of building up on the premise of the previous movie and using it to fuel new ideas. The cross species contamination has resulted into familiar animal-themed villains, such as Scorpion, Rhino, Vermin, Nattie,  and a few more familiar faces show themselves as well. The development for a cure even ties into Peter Parker's own nature as Spider-Man, which I found to be pretty clever.\n\nThe characters are all reasonably well-rounded and interesting. Gwen Stacy is a major player in this one, although those who saw her in the movie may be disappointed that Emma Stone does not reprise her role in the game, instead opting to use... well, some other girl. In fact, none of the movie actors show up here, and the voice actors they chose aren't really trying to act like their movie counter-parts. (Oh, well. I understand. Have to save money somewhere.)\nThe characters themselves are probably the best part of the story. Connor's is a man striving for redemption by destroying the monsters he has created. Smythe is egotistical, but not unsympathetic. Even Peter himself seems exhausted by the constant weight concomitant with being a superhero.\n\nSome minor complaints; the introduction of uber-powerful robots and Mass Effect levels of technology, stretches my suspension of disbelief to the breaking point. Apparently Oscorp's idea of dealing with the beginning stages of a viral outbreak is to send out a Reaper. I'm not kidding, it's a Mass Effect Reaper. It's like the first boss, too. I don't mind some science fiction, but given the relatively grounded first movie, I think it's silly that we can go from "Modern Day New York" to "Giant Robots" without even a pause for breath. And they never stop coming, either. I don't know of ANY corporation that has the budget to mass produce a robot army. It may seem like a petty complaint, but it's something I kept noticing and it bugged me.\n\nOverall, the story is above-average. I think it's actually signficantly stronger than both the movie and video game sequel that come later, and could've been made into a movie sequel in it's own right.\n\nMechanical\n\nThe game is primarily an open world sandbox that has third person stealth action levels for the main story missions, like the Spider-Man games that came before (that is to say, the good ones). The web swinging itself is alright, but leaves a lot to be desired, since it doesn't appear that webs actually connect to anything, but your swinging ability is just arbitrarily determined by height. There is some momentum control, which puts it ahead of some other Spider-Man games, but the addition of a more in-depth swinging mechanic would not have been unwelcome.\n\nRacing challenges, petty crimes, and other side quests litter the map, but they do tend to grind on a bit, especially later on when you have to pick up infected civilians, one at a time, and drop them off at a medical care center, one at a time. The side missions feel more like a chore, but they're not mandatory. The game's sole collectible is comic book pages, of which there are a ridiculous number of them, but, to the game's credit, the pages actually unlock comic-books, most of which are interesting reads. Good luck if you decide to collect all 700, because they aren't marked on your mini-map, and quite a few of them don't even stay in the same place.\n\nInside the story missions, the game decides to turn into the batman arkham games. Each segment has really two paths: Fighting or Stealth. When it comes to stealth, you can do stealth take downs from anywhere, even from the ceiling, and the upgrade allows you to do two people at once. However, some animations for the takedowns take way, way too long, (sometimes as long as 6 seconds), maximizing the chances that a patrolling enemy will turn around and see you. Also, there's no delay between an enemy gaining line of sight and an enemy sounding the alarm, so get used to suddenly changing your stealth plans into all-out war plans.\n\nWhen it comes to fighting the game emulates the Arkham games again. You can dodge, attack, and counter, and you have access to a couple of cool combos and moves that let you get a little tactical. It's competent and a little fun, but doesn't do it as well as the Arkham games. My biggest complaint is that each enemy requires different strategies to beat, but they aren't immediately visually distinct from each other. That means a lot of hitting a robot's forcefield, or a Heavy's block by accident, and messing up your beautiful combo streak.\n\nEnvironment design is a little drab as well, mostly the same assortment of Secret Labs and Underground Sewers, with only a few locations breaking the monotony of science fiction brown and grey.\n\nOverall, the game is competent and relatively well-structured, but it's strengths are mostly lifted from the Arkham games. Not a bad foundation for building upon, but it could've been a lot better.\n\nTechnical\n\nThere's some serious technical issues with this title on PC. On my machine, (i5 2.8 GHZ Processor, GTX 970) I regularly ran into crashes and freezing, although setting the City Life Density to medium seemed to fix the issue. I also had framerate drops frequently to below 20 for apparently no reason during story missions. Even lowering the graphics options to their lowest didn't even make a dent.\n\nI've also heard of issues where AMD card owners had even worse frame-rates. But I haven't experienced this issues first hand.\n\nI wouldn't go expecting a patch this late into the game, so if you do buy this one, be aware of the possible technical issues you may have.","June 23, 2015","true","21.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Sure it has some flaws and it crashes quite often, but despite that I had a lot of fun. The story sets after the first Amazing Spiderman Movie, but it doesn't really matter if you didn't watch it. You start of by doing your first mission and after that you can choose between swinging around in the city or continuing the storyline.  The sidequest makes you earn special features like concept arts etc. Although they are repetitive, it's fun just to swing around the city and finishing them. I played this with a 360 controller and the controls are something you need to get used to.\n\nThe story itself isn't mountain moving, but it isn't completely bad either.

This game isn't the worst I've ever played, but it certainly isn't the best either. And this is coming from a diehard Spider-Man fan. I was so excited for this game. I wanted to love it! But truthfully, this game is just not fun. There are a lot of reasons for this, but ultimately what makes it fail is its repetiveness. Everything about this game is repetitive. The side quests are all exactly the same. Every single one. The main quests are all also the same. You're almost always either in the sewers or Oscorp, and each location basically plays out the same way. Even the boss battles are all the same. You are either fighting a cross-species or a giant robot. Sure, swinging around the city, stopping crime, and trying to save New York is fun in the beginning. But it gets old fast. It got to the point where I had to force myself to finish the game because I wasn't having fun anymore.\n\nThere are some good points. The storyline in general was okay. Was it a little repetitive too? Yes. But at least it brought some intrigue to the game. The voice acting was excellent. There were quite a few one-liners in there that had me laughing. I definitely have to give them props for bringing in a Stan Lee cameo. The graphics were pretty good too.\n\nOnce again, is the game horrible? No. But it certainly isn't worth $40. Luckily I got it on sale, so I don't feel like I wasted my money. Ultimately I can't recommend this game for the price it's listed. So my advice to you? Wait for it to go on sale. It's worth it if you don't spend too much for it. But don't buy it for $40. You will only find yourself disappointed.","June 29, 2015","false","14.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

Almost...unplayable. I could not build up continious play time, experiencing crashes no less than every every 15 min. Wait til it's cheaper to check if it works with your rig.\n\nThe game itself, plays well, cutscene heavy with button presses during and the rest of the time fighting bosses or in an open world. The world is a decent size, typical collectables but the series events were enjoyable, like some of the powers they give you to play. However, the world events seemed sparse, you have to wait for the next event to unlock.\n\nCommon battles are not too tough, but some boss battles take a sec to see the strategy. Then again of course, be ready for your button presses during the cutscenes. Reminds me of Batman playstyle, different world, powers, and events.\n\nDecent game overall, just a little derivative, not that there is anything wrong with it. It is a good formula and it executes minus the almost unplayable errors for the PC/Steam version. Worse off, I check back a bit and no updates.","March 30, 2014","false","20.0"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","0"

And I still love it now. There was one major game breaking inconvinient: Every 2 hours or so, the game crash, independent of what you do, and you have to restart it. However, during my playtime, no saves were corrupted, so don't worry. On with the review then:\n\nGraphics: The Graphics are nice for a 2012 game, Spiderman's character model being the prettiest looking thing in the game, as well as the other Spiderman Suits.\n\nAudio: The Voice acting is really nice, and the music is perfect for each situation. When you are in combat, the music is adequate, and a big plus is the free roam music (8 different tracks which all feel fresh).\n\nStory: While the story is predictable, it is very well tied in and doesn't feel bland and boring. The Ending is also nice and the intro is also fine. All the different cross-species and robots you fight feel very suited for the mission.\n\nGameplay: The Combat is basically punch - dodge - evade - retreat, taken from the Batman games, but it is nice, and the acrobatic moves which Spidey does keep the battle satisfying and it doesn't get boring very fast. The Free Roam is very nice, the new Web-Rush ability lets you go from point to point very easy and fast, making you in control of Spidey's every move. The Web-Swing, some complain that Spidey ''swings from the sky'' which is true, but if you're not a perfectionist, you won't mind it too much. You also have different web abilities, like web shoot, web grab, the standard spidey moves. There is also a menu where you can customize Spiderman, or his web abilites, which is kind of rewarding. The Boss Battles are pattern-like, every boss has around 3 type of attacks which you will learn REALLY fast. This is a minus from me. By doing several activites (like collecting comic books, finishing the game) you will unlock 5 to 10 Spiderman Suits which are surprisingly eye-appealing and nice. A complain from me would be that most of the main mission take place in Oscorp, or the Sewers, only 2-3 taking place in New York. This was a minus from me. At street level, there isn't much to do, but once you get in the air, the fun begins (because swinging in New York is fun).\n\nLast Impression: I recommend this game to everybody. While it isn't a game changer or some sort of Game of The Year, it is nonetheless a nice experience, and i would play this game again at any time. So, what are you waiting Web-Heads? New York is your playground!","May 1","true","25.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Not exactly amazing, yet it is lighthearted and easy to play.  Addictive although riddled with crashes.   Repetitive indoor scenes that make you yearn to swing around the city again.  It lacks the depth and story telling that the Batman series has despite the amount of attention this superhero has had over the last decade.  I would put this as slightly better than average game with a reasonable amount of content for a sale price.  Don't expect it to have much in the way for replay value even if you're trying to earn the achievements.  The annoying crashes and ridiculous amount of comic book pages strewn throughout the city and indoor maps won't have you drinking your favorite energy/caffeinated beverage and threatening to miss an important event.  I give it a 6.5/10 for fun with flair despite obvious shortcomings.\n\nUpdate:  The story does seem a little less hokey once complete, but I still feel empty for having finished the normal difficulty.  The achievements on Steam only update when the game decides you can finish a certain number of achievements.  It's not a fully open & live world.  Things become available for you to do as chapters unlock so in a sense it's really a forced linear progression with optional challenges.  There aren't random wandering villains doing things on their own for you to take a break from the story.","April 11, 2014","true","17.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I have half a mind to submit a class action lawsuit for this issue it's pure negligence. even if it's to show game developers that you can't just release a game that doesn't function I mean even games in alpha and beta on steam warn you and are like "hey were not promising anything".

I enjoyed them all and assumed I would enjoy this one. That was not the case. One of the few enjoyable features of this game is the web swinging through quite an aesthetically pleasing city. To me it seems like this game was rushed as Hollywood blockbuster films turned games tend to be. There is so much repetition and lazy scenery that the game lacks the freedom and creativity that the previous Spiderman games provided. From it being the same ducts you climb through, to the same fans you must web to get through and the same boring enemies you must fight. I also had a huge problem as every chapter or so the game would crash and I would on occasion need to re-do some of what I had just done. I know this was not my hardware as I can play MUCH more demanding games with no problems whatsoever. In conclusion this is one of the worst Spiderman games I have played and would not recommend it to anyone. Even if a fan of the previous games.","July 8, 2014","false","11.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bluefox42/recommended/212580/","bluefox42","pieceoftheuniverse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bluefox42/","342 products in account","The Amazing Spider-Man continues the storyline from the movie released in July. Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy take a slightly unauthorized tour through Oscorp tower, where, naturally, everything starts going out of control. A new villain - surprisingly, not Norman Osborn, but another crazy scientist, Dr Alistaire - has taken advantage of Dr Connors' sudden imprisonment, and moved the R&D department into a whole new direction.\n\nOf evil.\n\nThere are two main villain types: mutated humanoids that have somehow been trained to sense and attack any "cross-species," like our friendly neighborhood web-slinger. In a rare moment of sanity, Dr Alistaire realized that these mutants may not be entirely reliable, and developed a series of droids that have the same ability. Of course, this gets out of hand as the doctor gets paranoid, revealing bigger and more destructive robots and highly experimental mutants.\n\nI like the idea behind this game more than the execution. Web-swinging around the city is fun, the continuation of the latest movie's story is well done, and the fighting is fluid and dynamic when up against humans.\n\nBut early on, our favourite neighborhood wall-crawler is put up against robots. Lots and lots of four-legged robots with near-instant tracking, shields that can block all but a certain combo, and that can shrug off webbing in a couple of seconds.\n\nFighting the humans (either muggers or others) is immensely fun. The stealth sections are excellent, and being able to zip from cover to cover anywhere you like is a fantastic variation on the formula introduced by the Rocksteady Batman franchise. The boss fights are a little finicky and rely too heavily on quicktime actions, but can still be engaging. But the robots ... gods, the robots. They drag the game down.\n\nI understand that every game like this needs its "tough" mook. Arkham Asylum has its knife-wielding thugs and the stun batons, and this game has its robots. But where Batman had maybe two or three knives in a group, Spiderman has to fight entire rooms filled with robots. Story-wise, sure, it makes sense. But game-wise, it's just exhausting, and makes the game a pain.\n\nI can recommend the game for it's web-swinging, collectible-hunting, the challenges, and the rescue of citizens. But be warned that Spidey's wisecracks repeat a little too often, and following the storyline may be an exercise in frustration.","February 22, 2014","true","16.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

New York's crime rate is at a record low in this game. Only a very small and fixed number of "petty crimes" can be stopped between the pretty okay story missions. After that, you're out of work, until you start the next story mission.\nEven if there was more going on in NY, the way to get there would not be that much fun. The swinging controls are horrible. Just push and hold the swing button and all that is left to actually control is the direction. Forget about swinging and slinging from building to building any way you want. You don't even need buildings to swing, the open sky will do.\nEven more disappointing than the lackluster movie it is based on.","November 30, 2013","false","1.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Where are the landmarks, where's the empire state. New york should have been just as much of a character in this game as Spidey and the villains are.\n\nThe villians are mostly cookie cutter. A generic, "Oscorp makes some bad things that are released onto the city" is fairly uninspiring and each type of bad guy has the same model and skin used over and over again. Combat gets boring quite quickly.\n\nThe indoor sections are fairly dull and poorly designed and detailed. Bearing in mind that you can crawl on any surface, it would have been great to have puzzle areas where you have to combine your swinging, crawling and jumping skills to reach a particular point...\nInstead there's a mechanic where you turn your spidey sense on which pauses the game, and can scan round for various points that you can latch onto. This basically renders any skill you had jumping, web slinging and climbing to be pointless. That's all I've been doing, hit that button, select where i want to go, let go of button and Spidey zips there immediatly in a pre-rendered animation. Very little input from the player is required. Its  a really cheap mechanic that spoils the game.\n\nOne other thing that bugs (haha) me is that we spend no time out of costume. How refreshing it would have been if there were areas where we had to take the costume off or be shot at... The film this game is based on is more about Peter Parker than it is about Spiderman. It would have been great crawling up walls to sneak into places as Peter... a real shame...\n\nI know that movie titles are pretty much always bad (memories of Iron man on the Wii still haunt me) due to the limited production time and, for a movie title, its probably way better than it should have been but that still doesn't make it much fun.\n\nIf you're looking for a Spiderman game, I don't think this is on you want...","January 25, 2014","false","3.6"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

However seeing as this is a superhero game thay have more freedom to play around with ways to move about than traditional games (Ex. Red Dead redemption, GTA, Just Cause, Far Cry, etc.), and soon you will be swinging around manhattan feeling free as Peter Parker himself. ...\nUntill you go too fast for Manhattan to actually load that is. Don't get me wrong, some games are heavier than others, but even on the lowest graphics settings you'll find yourself waiting for spidey to continue his swing as more of the streets below him load.\n\nWhat would a free roaming game be without collectibles, right? Things you have to COLLECT, seek, find, other synonyms. This game just doesn't have that, it has classic spider-man comics floating around the city (Oh nice! WRONG) there are so many collectibles that I can't imagine someone would actually take the time to get them all. Just swing around a block and you'll already have found about 5 of the pages. It just isn't fun and breaks the gameplay.\n\nOverall a fun concept, but sadly (just like any other movie-based game) it was doomed to fail.","January 27, 2014","false","10.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Only played an hour, but already I can see this is worse than the ones that were on the ps2. The worst parts of this game are the:\n1. The web swinging. This was the best part of the second and third game from the ps2, yet here it plays like the first game where you dont have much control when swinging around manhatten\n2. The story. It seems as though it was written by a child\n3. The simplicity of the combat. The combat is similar in style to the batman games, yet I found it had more of an assassins creed feel to it. This really could have been done more like Prince of Persia or God of War style.\n4. Simplicity of side missions.\n\nAll in all the biggest problem is that this game seems to be catered to children, making it unchallaging and I may as well watch a movie than play this.\n\nAs for the positives, I do think the bosses are very much likemost superhero games which I enjoyed, where they have a weakspot that you must exploit a few times over. Also there is a good feel for being spiderman, with the visual side of the combat, and the visual part of swinging through the city, but I dont have to try to do any of these.\n\nEven buying this on sale, I am dissapointed and won't keep playing it.

The game might spoil a thing or two.)\nNow don't expect a linear game, like some of the previous SM installments; this is a free roam game, meaning you can do whatever you want. There's plenty of stuff to do as well; saving citizens, catching bad guys, collecting comic books, doing stunts, you name it. The game controls extremely well and doesn't look bad at all. When slinging through the city performance might take a hit though. It's still acceptable and perfectly playable, but definitely noticable. Now eventually you'll run out of secondary missions. They're not random and repeatable. This happens most likely near the end of the game. It's a bit of a shame. Still, collecting all the comic books will take you quite a few hours.\nThe main story is pretty decent, the voice acting solid and the missions are mostly diverse.

Repetitive sidequests, some of the main missions are repetitive, not all of the cinematics are skippable when replaying a mission. Solid music, decent voice acting, last-gen looking graphics though.\n\nFor playing on hard, it was really easy. There's 2 different get out of jail free cards to prevent most deaths unless you're just being careless. Also, a lot of hand-holding to make sure you beat the game.  Like I said, it's cinematic heavy and they really want you to get through it.  Way too many damn collectibles, but they aren't that hard to get, believe me.  Nothing in this game was even close to hard.\n\nThe regular Manhattan sections, you move too fast like he's on crack. The Spiderman 2 movie game for XBox/PS2 is still the best Spiderman game ever IMO, the web swing mechanic was perfected there, I don't know why they didn't just keep it for every game after that.\n\nStill, it's a solid game. 22-23 hours of gameplay for doing 100%, I enjoyed it.","December 18, 2012","true","23.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShonowTH/recommended/212580/","ShonowTH","Taco Belle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShonowTH/","84 products in account","The Amazing Spider-Man video game somehow manages to go right over most players' heads regarding the concept that it takes place after the movie. The second game is after this game, it does not coincide with the movie whatsoever. The games and the movies are 2 different stories that separate after the first movie.\n\nWith that out of the way, I'll skip the common details people pay attention to and say that this game was definitely meant to be played on its highest difficulty, which is still incredibly easy. They strongly incorporate Spidey's need for stealth in the gameplay, which I was really happy to discover. Among the right baddies, though, stealth isn't even necessary, and it makes a great variety.\n\nSwinging through town is pretty tedious with how unimportant it is how you travel. Your top speed is similar to the swinging speed in the Spider-Man game that came with the movie back in 2002, and it's very monotonous. The only real difference is the length of time he'll hold onto the web line before making a new one. The webs don't attach to buildings, but they do enforce a relative placement rule, which basically prevents you from swinging at various altitudes, depending on how tall the buildings (or trees) in the area are.\n\nI greatly appreciated the web rush feature, which basically opens a window of near-infinite reflex where you can look around, assess the situation a little better, and find a point (or target) to web zip to.\n\nIf you want a nice little surprise, set your calendar to sometime in August 2012 (the day doesn't matter) and head over to the closet in the apartment.","May 28, 2014","true","96.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You’ll play as none other than our famous Hero Spider-Man, Peter Parker. The game itself is jammed packed with tons of quests’ you’ll need to complete within the city. The main storyline is an epic one. You’ll need to save the city from a deadly outbreak of a virus that’s come to be known as cross-species. An idea based off of Dr. Curt Connors continued research by Alistair Smythe at Oscorp. One scratch or bite from an infected cross species and you’ll not only turn, but will die. Not all the stories characters are in this game but it is as I said Jammed packed with characters we all know and love. In game bonus’s include 3-D character models, Artwork, and a special edition of certain comic books.

The free roaming in the world is alright, webslinging is kind of a hard thing to mess up though they manage to do it a bit with having the controls darting back and forth from 10 year old high on sugar and heroin to O.A.P after a bowl of weed.\n\nStill that's a small niggle, I mean, the missions /HAVE/ to be good, right?\n\nNoooooooooooooooopeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.\n\nThey suffer from City of Heroes-itis, also known as boringashitwhyamidoingthis. From what I've seen (I didn't give it too much of a chance because I find it soul-sucking.) half the missions appear to be random rooms with seven or eight guys in them followed by a boss of some kind or a slightly tougher enemy to take down.\n\nIt's just so cookie-cutter and it feels like there's no real depth or love put into the game, in short, it's mediocre.\n\nThen again, the film was just okay too, so maybe they were trying to tie-in in more than one way.","May 10, 2013","true","2.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"

Indoors sections handle perfectly, while outdoor sections chug and lag like it's in season. I believe this could be an AMD-isolated issue, but when a game works perfectly on systems like Xbox 360 - which, I should remind you, is actually built with an AMD GPU - and barely functions on a high-end PC, there's not much reason to support the developer or publisher. It's a perfectly serviceable tie-in game for Spider-Man fans... but, sadly, only on consoles. It's a shame.","September 26, 2014","false","8.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is a fix to make it run, but it results in the game launching in a stupid 600x400 resolution (or something like that) and I cannot fix this.\n\nSo all in all I have not been able to enjoy this game even though I have two systems that should be able to more than run it.

However I felt it didn't have enough pace and suspense to keep me interested for long enough and the more breaks between story line to finish the open world missions(which were all exactly the same) just made the game drag for me. I feel the combat is very similar to the Arkham games so In my opinion unless you are the biggest Spidey fan out there and wouldn't be seen dead with a Batman game, get Arkham Asylum instead.","February 12, 2015","false","14.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Swinging around the city felt pretty cool though. I had no desire to play any of the side missions and this game was lacking any attention to detail like that Batman Arkham games, of course those are now the standard for good comic book games.

Isn't perfect but, it's really funny to cross the city ala Spiderman, something you always dreamed, for sure.\nGameplay is quite similar to Batman, by example. But, I find Batman a more refinated game and, easier to control, even that all these games where the push of a button triggers a chain of complex movements are difficult to master, since you have to wait until the whole sequence of movements finished to start a new combo.\nThis game has some glitches in my own PC. It crashes often and, since it works with checkpoints, you can easily lost lot of effort.\nI'm a fan of Spiderman and I hate Batman, as a Comic character but, I recognize Batman is a rounder game.\nEven that, I am having lot of fun with my favourite comic hero.\nThanks for leaving me to be the spidey for a while!.","September 16, 2014","true","27.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The momvement and combat feels polished and the storyline and cutscenes are well implemented and do not distract from the gameplay.  There are a variety of side missions and collectibles that contribute to unlocking concept art, digital comic books, and new Spider-Man skins.  Unfortunately, although wide screen modes are supported the Steam Overlay is not, and the game tends to crash frequently.  The biggest dissapointment of this title however is it's overall length.  You will likely complete both the campaign and side objectives in around 15 hours, which makes the 49.99 asking price a bit high.

My favourite thing in this game is the cool web swinging where u can easily swing around the city with spidey performing acrobatics in the air .The bosses r cool and  satisfying.\n\nThe side missions r really repeatitive though(apart from my fav photo shoot missions) and r boring.\n\nThe game has decent graphics.\n\nAnd one more cool feature of the game is that there r comic pages roaming around the city(no idea why) which when u collect enough of them unlocks spiderman comics which u can read in the main menu.\n\nOverall: 8/10;\nBest Spidey game ever.","September 29, 2014","true","17.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Instead it's a cheesy backstep in game evolution to give a good looking but very campy feeling and clunky playing game that could have been done much better. In my view, all the problems can be summed up on just one messed up mechanic: Web swinging, which in this game is not swinging at all, but more like web flying, because in this game you swing from clouds.","February 28, 2015","false","20.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It does a decent job, but falls short in a few areas. The PC port is...well, it's bad. It crashes. A lot. Sometimes it doesn't even start. So that in and of itself is enough to give this game a negative review.\n\nYou're Spider-Man (obviously) and you're house-sitting in Manhattan for Stan Lee. Oscorp is cleaning up all the crap from the project that created Lizard, when, you guessed it, all hell breaks loose and you, being Spider-Man, have to fix it. The way they handle the lore, pretty much every supervillain you know in the world of Spider-Man has been created by Oscorp, because, convenience I guess. But despite not sticking to comic book standard, they were all done fairly well.\n\nThe combat is nice, and kind of feels like the Batman: Arkham series. There are plenty of opportunities for a good tactical fight, and many more opportunities for a stealthy approach, if done correctly. Each enemy will require a different strategy to defeat, which would normally be fantastic were it not for the fact that most of the enemies look way too similar, so it's pretty hard to tell which type of enemy is which.\n\nThere are collectibles. A ridiculous amount of collectibles. They're all comic books, and if you get enough of them you can unlock digital comics to read, which is nice. Still though, collectible hunting sucks and usually adds nothing to any game, ever.\n\nAnd speaking of which, there are quite a bit of side quests as well, but they're not very varied. Random crimes, for the most part. It can get pretty tedious, especially when you're on your way to a main story objective and then all of a sudden right as soon as you're about to get there, BOOM random crime pops up. Good thing they're optional, but what kind of Spider-Man would you be if you ignored them?\n\nAt full price, I'd stay away from the game. Or just buy it on a console for a better experience, because, y'know, bad PC port. Buy it on a decent sale if you want, but you could also spend that money on something else.","December 13, 2015","false","13.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The story is enjoyable enough and just about makes this console port bareable.  The game play mimics the Batman Arkham series, building up a combo and then finishing off the mooks, only the animation and "feel" of the combat feels rushed and unpolished, or you can stick to the roof and silently takedown everyone, this part of the game feels forced and the AI is terrible, takedown one and just walk off the whole room forgets you ever existed.  The gameworld is open ended between the linear story missions and the option here for some side quests, but these are unneccesary and repetitive (unless you are a 100% kinda person, which I'm not so much).\nAs with a lot of console ports - if you don't have some form of control, don't even bother booting this game, I tried for an hour and it's unplayable.\nRecommend: If you are a spiderman fan and absolutely must play every game with him included. (Just go play MUA2 again)\nIf this isn't you, skip it.\n\nNext game: Amnesia: The Dark Descent","August 11, 2014","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No more is there a heavy attack and light attack, you have counter moves and spam the hit button and roll... wait. hold on. that sounds like one of those Bat-Man games! DING DING DING your correct.. This game is like if Spidey made a game with Bat-Man then this interesting peice of something was born.\n\nPros-\n\nAwesome fights between giant robots that are SUPER cenematic!\n\nCool looking fluid combat\n\nNice stealth system, but seriously ♥♥♥♥ that, this is a Spider-Man game not Splenter Cell.\n\nAwesome costumes to find and collect\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nCons-\n\nWeb swinging feels more like a chore than actually fun swinging,,, let me explain:\n(swinging in this game is like ((for gamepad users)) hold down trigger and he will keep moving forward and swinging more and more and more and when you release he stops his little swinging animations and lands on the ground) in other words it sucks ♥♥♥ compared to the other good games like Web of Shadows,, just pay no attention to parkers voice acting in that,\n\nIf you have some sort of graphics card like AMD or something I dont know exactly that isn't built for the game it will lag like spawning over 9,000 combine NPC's in garrys mod. (in other words it lags like crazy)\nto mildly fix the lag you got to make a .DLL file specificaly for your computers hardware and place it in there instead to stop it "a little"... I hope you noticed the quotes because I was trying to catch your attention there,\n\nOnce you stopped all the robbers and bad thugs in the city there was nothing left for you to do except mindlessly swing from one building to the next with the bad swingin mechanic they have.\n\nThere were some plot holes or something but ♥♥♥♥ the story, giant robot battles are cool\n\n================================================\nCONCLUSION.\nI feel this game would have been better if the world was bigger and they looked at good Spider-Man games for refference like I don't know WEB OF SHADOWS,\nyou know what, I just want a remake of WoS better voice acting next gen graphics.. or now gen in all of its glory. I'm sure you can guess what Spidey game ill be playing more.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes, to those who dont mind a mindless fairly bad Spidey game. the giant Robot battles are cool and the combat is fluid and fun to watch, but not for 50 bucks, get it on sale. id say its worth about 14 bucks at most.

The combat system is reminiscent of the Rocksteady Studios-developed Batman game series ("Batman: Arkham Asylum" and "Batman: Arkham City") using a freeflow design and counterattacks.\nIt uses a quite unique damage system—the more damage Spider-Man takes, the more his suit is damaged; returning to the 'hub' area repairs the suit.\nMany DLC packs have been released for the game; one of these is the "Lizard Rampage pack," where players play as the Lizard (main antagonist of the movie).\nThe "Rhino Challenge pack" has players control the Rhino character, destroying cars and thugs. The "Oscorp Search and Destroy pack" has two minigames with similar gameplay to Snake and Space Invaders. The final DLC pack is the "Stan Lee Adventure pack", in which players can play as Marvel creator and writer Stan Lee (with Spider-Man's powers).\nThere are also many in-game references to characters in other franchises (e.g. Batman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Captain America).\nThere are several different kinds of collectibles and the player can assemble full, vintage comic books, such as Amazing Fantasy #15, as they collect comic covers throughout the game.\n\nStory:\nSet a few months after the events of the film, Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy sneak into the restricted areas of Oscorp after hours, where Gwen reveals her suspicions that they may be continuing the cross-species experiments of Dr. Curt Connors - the man who had become the monstrous Lizard.\nThe two are caught by Alistair Smythe, the new Oscorp director, who confirms Gwen's suspicions, although the cross-species carry a powerful virus and are to be disposed.\nHowever, the cross-species all react to the presence of Peter, a cross-species himself, and break out of their various containment cells and cages, infecting all of the scientists, including Smythe and Gwen, in the process.\nSmythe unleashes his security robots, which are programmed to defend them from cross-species. Peter quickly dons his Spider-Man suit and gets the infected to quarantine, fighting off the robots in the process, but is unable to stop the cross-species and the virus from escaping into the city.\nSpider-Man goes to the Beloit Psychiatric Hospital, and seeks the help of the incarcerated Connors to develop a cure for the virus. Connors relents, but only if he is returned to the asylum when the crisis is resolved. They set up a laboratory at the apartment of Aunt May's friend Stan, and begin development of an antidote, while keeping in close contact with Gwen and Smythe via webcam.\nAt the same time, Smythe is developing his own "cure" which involves nanobots destroying the host from the inside out. Spider-Man soon form an alliance with Whitney Chang, an investigative reporter who believes Oscorp's facelift operation is a scam, in unveiling the suspicious activities of Oscorp.\nTogether the three of them - Spider-Man, Connors and Chang - try to stop the violent virus from spreading further and in a race against time fight to prevent New York City from becoming one giant Zoo...\n\nMy opinions:\nI am a longtime fan of Spider-Man.\nNot a hardcore, comic collecting fan - but a fan nontheless.\nBack in 2011, when I first heard the news that a new film series was to be made, I was a bit sceptical.\nI had always loved the older trilogy (featuring Tobey Maquire as Spider-Man/Peter Parker), but I was positively surprised when I saw the movie. The new movie gave the on-screen Spider-Man a needed facelift and shot some new webbing into the franchise.\n"Was the game as good?", you might wonder. Well, the answer is what is usually is with games based on movies: both yes and no.\nThe combat feels quite natural and flows on in a nice way, as does the web swinging. The swinging might not be as "realistic"\nas in the sequel (released 2014), since the web does not have to stick to actual concrete material, but overall it looks good and gives a feeling of freedom.\nManhattan - where the game is set - is big and explorable, although it looks about the same wherever you go. There are some side-activities, but they are a bit repetitive and get boring after a while.\nCompared to old Spider-Man games, I enjoyed the mechanics more in this one and found it to be a generally better game - not only because of it being newer.\nThe only thing this game REALLY lacked, in my opinion, was a good story.\nWithout any spoilers, I can say this much: the plot is centered on the same stuff as the movie. If you  were hoping to fight other enemies than the ones based on animals (Lizard, Rhino, Iguana etc), you will be disappointed. This is - in a way - logical, since the game focuses on a virus outbreak turning people into animal-like superhumans.\nBut it would be interesting to see some other of Spider-Man's enemies and not have to play Zoo-keeper all the time.\n\nI mainly recommend this game to fans of Spider-Man and the new movie-franchise, but also to people who enjoy superhero-games in general.\nDon't have too high hopes though.","July 28, 2014","true","23.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The new movie gave the on-screen Spider-Man a needed facelift and shot some new webbing into the franchise.\n"Was the game as good?", you might wonder. Well, the answer is what is usually is with games based on movies: both yes and no.\nThe combat feels quite natural and flows on in a nice way, as does the web swinging. The swinging might not be as "realistic"\nas in the sequel (released 2014), since the web does not have to stick to actual concrete material, but overall it looks good and gives a feeling of freedom.\nManhattan - where the game is set - is big and explorable, although it looks about the same wherever you go. There are some side-activities, but they are a bit repetitive and get boring after a while.\nCompared to old Spider-Man games, I enjoyed the mechanics more in this one and found it to be a generally better game - not only because of it being newer.\nThe only thing this game REALLY lacked, in my opinion, was a good story.\nWithout any spoilers, I can say this much: the plot is centered on the same stuff as the movie. If you  were hoping to fight other enemies than the ones based on animals (Lizard, Rhino, Iguana etc), you will be disappointed. This is - in a way - logical, since the game focuses on a virus outbreak turning people into animal-like superhumans.\nBut it would be interesting to see some other of Spider-Man's enemies and not have to play Zoo-keeper all the time.\n\nI mainly recommend this game to fans of Spider-Man and the new movie-franchise, but also to people who enjoy superhero-games in general.\nDon't have too high hopes though.","July 28, 2014","true","23.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nc595/recommended/212580/","nc595","Nitrocide595","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nc595/","132 products in account","I haven't finished the game yet but there's some things I already like and some things I don't.  For now, I'm rating "Do not recommend" for any of the fans of the old spiderman games on Gamecube.  We know Spiderman 2 was the strongest of the series so I'll stick with that.\n\nHonestly, I enjoyed the old gamecube "Spiderman 2" a hell of a lot more.  In comparison, this game is missing a lot that the first one had.  First and foremost Bruce Campbell as the narrator... but in all seriousness, there's no real push or draw to the free roam aspect.\n\nIn spiderman 2, the city was pretty much the ENTIRE city of New York, Roosevelt Island, and Statue of Liberty included.  Now?  It's a way scaled down map shrunken to the size of a small town.  We're talking about 1/16 the size of GTA V's map.  the city looks bland with no real land marks or distinct features.  The environment looks cheap with boxy cars and people always running in fear from nothing, moving exactly the same as one another.  Windows are just pasted JPEG files that look disgusting.  I could swear that I'm playing on "Low Quality", but everything is set for, what they call, "Amazing" (What a Punn...)\n\nI like the "stealth attacks" and the introduction of the stealth system compared to older spiderman games.  It gives a sneaky and useful feel to battle and it's not just "Run in and throw punches" all the time.\n\nThe story line is alright so far and fills in some gaps between the movies, so no major complaints there.\n\nThe game feels as though it's on rails most of the time, again, with no real draw to the free roam that IS available.  I find myself saying "Alright, screw it, next mission".\n\nMy major complaint is within game mechanics, specifically movement.  Compared to the Gamecube Spiderman 2, Movement is a chore.  In the old game, you had several different methods of swinging, web-zipping for height, and acrobatic stunts that made moving fun, clear cut, and exciting.  In this game, although the acrobatics have been improved (visually), you hold 2 buttons and point where you want to go and the game does the rest.  Half the time, you're slinging webs into the sky and swinging off nothing.  In the gamecube game, you anchored to buildings and swung from those points, logically.  The game just feels sloppy to say the least.  You can't even jump on top of a car like the other game.  Jumping up on a ledge can be a chore hen your jump falls just short and you have to sling a web for that extra 2 feet...\n\nFinal complaint is this new fangled feature where you see through Spiderman's eyes and spot a point to jump to.  It's essentially auto-pilot as if they knew their movement mechanics were crap to begin with.\n\n\nI can't say it's the worst game I've ever played (*Cough* Ghost Rider *Cough*), but it's playing runner up to quite a few games as far as awards go.","February 18, 2015","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But this game (like X-Men Origins Wolverine's game) makes up for the bad film. This game is a lot of fun and brings comic book canon to the game while still retaining the bullcrap from the film. The game still has lots of bad things like Rhino and Scorpion being cross species but cool things like Iguana being a boss battle villain. Beenox loves Spider-Man and it shows in this great game.\nPurchase skills with skill points and tech points, get new costumes to use in the story, take pictures of enemies and challenges to unlock concept art and character bios; really a great game to make up for the film. Totally worth it.\nPROS: Better than the movie, chronilogically after the film instead of interpreting the film into a game, good combat, good graphics, Beenox is great with Spider-Man, Spider-Man feels more like Spider-Man than in the Sam Raimi films, cool webbing effects, fun to webswing around the NYC.\nCONS: Takes place in the same universe as the movie, changes some villains too much, The Lizard still has that same, stupid face, not enough costumes to collect, voice-actors instead of the actors of the film, nothing done in this game will be reflected upon in the sequel film.","September 13, 2013","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once that was fixed, all the sweet web was mine to sling.\n\nI have also been victim to the infamous "random" crashing. The game crashes about every hour for me. It's annoying, but this game is worth it.\n\nThe fighting system is very much akin to that of the recent Batman games, which I love. The graphics are very good still and giving me the option to play as Stan Lee (with the additional DLC) is fantastic.\n\nSo, if you're interested in this game, do like I did and grab a copy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ristleraine/recommended/212580/","Ristleraine","Ristle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ristleraine/","238 products in account","This game has more bugs in it than a spider nest, so buyer beware. The biggest of which is random crashes, which seemed to be more frequent to me with longer play sessions, as well as later into the game. It also has random texture issues with building reflections at certain times of the day, most notable towards the early evening open map, as well as dawn.\n\nSwinging doesn't feel really satisfying in this, as the animations seem off at times, and momentum isn't really there at points. You can hold onto a web and swing around in any direction with full speed, even the opposite direction, which would usually cause past Spiderman games to swing a new web due to changing direction so quickly, or slow you down as you have to build the speed back up.\n\nCombat feels a bit shallow as well, sadly. The last two Spiderman games from Activision that I played, Webs of Shadows and Shattered Dimensions, had some pretty satisfying combat in them. This game tries to play like the Batman: Arkham series, but seems flat in comparison. Most areas for combat have items you can use to set the tides in your favor, such as dumpsters or other objects that Spidey can pick up and lob down at his enemies to stun them, and then go in for quick submission webbing. You also have the ability to do stealth take downs, again like in Arkham. The difference here is that LB on your controller will instantly pull you to safety, and usually reset the AI into thinking you're not in area, short of you landing immediately in their eyesight. Just abuse that and swoop in from above to bypass any combat, since the rewards don't seem to differ that much.\n\nAs a Spiderman game, it's ALRIGHT. It'll leave you wanting more, but that's mostly due to the lack of polish that probably came as a response of being a movie tie in. It's one of the few games in recent years that actually has unlockables, where you have to get comics spread across the open hub world, and doing so unlocks actual Spidey comics as well as costumes to use ingame. The biggest selling point is that it's on Steam, so that's a perk?","May 14, 2014","false","23.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On one hand, it's made by the same guys as Shattered Dimensions, and it really shows. The gameplay features elements that feel like all the Spider-Men from Shattered Dimensions mixed together, with a sort of Batman: Arkham-esque combat. The New York City hub is quite fun, even though it has moon-webs, but it never feels like more than a hub for going between stages. In short, if you go into this looking for the city exploring fun of Spider-Man 2 or Ultimate Spider-Man, then you will be disappointed, but if you're looking for a quite fun movie tie-in in the style of Shattered Dimensions, there's really a lot of value here.

I had to install it on the C drive just to make it work, so that required 2 installations - and downloads for that matter - before I could even play the game!  After playing through the first few minutes and first mission of the game, I managed to reach the free-roaming section of the game, which was cool.  I entered another mission, and it crashed.\n\nThe story starts off a little rocky, and I don't really like certain boss fights,  including the giant robot, but the free-roaming is kind of fun for a short while.  I was having some fun just swinging around.  Granted, the swinging isn't nearly as impressive as in earlier Spider-Man games.  If the combat was a little more ruly, I might like it, but there was no auto-lock targeting system, and a lot of the combat scenes involve putting Spidey in tight quarters like he's Batman from the Arkham series.","June 23, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is pretty good overall, and the only thing that kills it is the frequent random crashes that many people seem to be experiencing (usually once every 20 or 30 minutes, but some chapters appear to be more stable than others). That's really annoying, especially if it happens towards the end of a boss fight and you have to repeat it from the start. Considering how common this issue is, I am surprised that the developers didn't bother providing a patch to fix it. However, that's the only thing that really annoys me about this game.\n\nSome people have said that this game wants to be a Batman game, but fails to do so. I partially agree, in that many of the combat and navigation mechanichs are clearly inspired by the Arkham series. However, I don't see why that would be a bad thing, those mechanics are good, and they clearly work well in this kind of games. Combat can be fairly varied (lots of attacks and combos to choose from), and all the animations are well done and pretty cool, but perhaps switching between attacking and blocking is not as fluid as in a Batman game.\n\nBelow is a summary of what I think of the main aspects of this game:\n\nSoryline: 8/10 (sure, some parts are a bit unlikely, but ehi, its a Spiderman game! the main story is fairly long and will keep you busy for a while).\n\nGraphics: 9/10 (Spiderman has never looked so good in a videogame and Manhattan is gorgeous).\n\nAnimations: 9/10 (animations are really good, but a bit repetitive in boss fights)\n\nVoice acting: 10/10\n\nSound/Music: 9/10 (the soundrack is mostly ok, but one or two pieces really stand out as epic)\n\nGameplay: 7/10 (game is easy to learn, even if traveling upside down on the roofs can be a bit disorienting at times. I guess that's part of the Spiderman experience! In some instances it's not super clear what you have to do to progress along the story, but nothing too hard to figure out. Boss fights are ok, but never really challenging. Swinging between buildings in Manhattan is a blast, just a bit odd when you can swing from the sky!)\n\nStability/glitches/bugs: 5/10 ( I didn't experience any glitches, but very frequent crashes to desktop. Pretty frustrating in a game that is fairly good otherwise).\n\nOverall score: 7/10","February 12","true","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is pretty good overall, and the only thing that kills it is the frequent random crashes that many people seem to be experiencing (usually once every 20 or 30 minutes, but some chapters appear to be more stable than others). That's really annoying, especially if it happens towards the end of a boss fight and you have to repeat it from the start. Considering how common this issue is, I am surprised that the developers didn't bother providing a patch to fix it. However, that's the only thing that really annoys me about this game.\n\nSome people have said that this game wants to be a Batman game, but fails to do so.

The optimization for the Game Launcher is very bad, I had to consult to the Steam Discussions to find a way to bypass the "Memory Requirement" part of the launch, because I supposedly didn't have the required amount of memory to play it even though my system exceeded all of the requirements. Even after looking at the negative reviews, I really tried to convince myself to get this game since it was on sale, and I did, but even when I was playing the game, it just seems unfinished in a weird way. It feels like the free roam world is... empty. All there really is, is a ♥♥♥♥ ton of comic book page collectibles and an occasional helicopter.

Swinging around Manhattan had never felt so great. Instead of a boring storyline that I thought it may be, it turns out to be really exciting. Collecting comic pages gave me a sense of satisfaction, let alone being able to unlock some of the past spiderman comic issues. Graphics are pretty decent considering its from year 2012. There are different variety of spiderman suits to unlock as you progress deeper into the story allowing you to choose how do you want your spiderman to look like. Oh and I really really love how the suit slowly wears and tear as you recieve damages while doing missions. Overall I really enjoyed this game a lot and boy I can't wait to start on The Amazing Spider-Man 2. One letdown though, is that the game crashes randomly, often around at the 2 hours mark =/","May 22","true","29.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(So I started to mess around with the settings) I found out I could run the game in any resolution but the Graphics Preset could not be above Medium.

Plenty of side objects and collectables to chase.\n\nRuns really well on win10, saw 1 crash after playing for about 4 hours straight but the frequent auto saves meant near no progress loss. Note, for some reason after a bit of play time the button notifications (where the icon appears on screen to dodge or signature move etc) stopped appearing. Dosent prevent gameplay but does force a bit of skill on the players part.\n\nDoes NOT like laptop mobile graphics cards. The developers never got around to adding mobile card support so every laptop I've tried this game on with a mobile card, the launcher refused to let me play the game because the launcher thinks the laptop dosent have a gpu at all. Exception to this : If you have a laptop with one of the desktop 980 gtx cards in it, your gold. Those are desktop cards and this game recognizes the 980 gtx desktop card in a laptop.\n\nOne final observation, controllers. My xBox One wireless controller does work with this game but conditionally. If the controller is on before the game is launched, the controller is unresponsive. If however the controller is turned on at the main menu, good to go.\n\nmsi gt80s laptop i7 skylake, 64gig ram, 2x 980 gtx sli.
