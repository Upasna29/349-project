It is host to amazing music, a wonderful art style and a challenging yet fun style of platforming. As you travel around the different locations of the city, turning everything back on again, it is always satisfying to see the effect of your actions. Such as scaring away looters and people who are taking advantage of the darkness to perform bad deeds. The musical sections in which you must travel along a long bridge of power lines in beat with the music are also a nice break in between areas. The game also subtly spreads the message of environmental awarness in a nice and calm sort of way, without sounding all preachy about it. If you are a fan of colourful, cute and musically satisfying games, then TurnOn is the game for you.\n\nSee my full review of the game here at Blot gaming.\nhttp://www.blotgaming.com/game-reviews/turnon/\n\nAlso see a Let's Play of the game from another member of Blot gaming here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG_-exfpMEQ","June 1","true","6.5"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

Which is where TurnOn comes in. A casual platformer developed by the four man team of Brainy Studio, TurnOn features some great relaxing music, colorful art style, and creative level designs.\n\nTurnOn is a narrative story told through comic-like cutscenes and during the game’s levels. After a power station accident, an alien becomes sentient by fusing with the power stations’ systems. Players take control of the little ball of alien electricity as it makes it way throughout the city trying to restore the cities’ power. Players travel along the electrical wires throughout the power station, residential, and commercial districts of the city. Players must solve puzzles like helping a little girl get home safely and fighting crime by setting off alarm systems to scare off looters.\nThe levels of TurnOn are wonderfully colorful and dynamic. The power lines allow players to travel seamlessly from the background to the foreground. This gives each level the feeling of being three dimensional despite the games 2D art. What slightly contrasted this great feature was that the electric alien of the game would not change in size when moving from the foreground to background in some parts of the game. It was minor, but it still made the character seem out of place compared to everything else, which would shrink and grow in size as the game’s camera moved back and forth. The game’s puzzles in each level were not overly challenging. It mainly just took a bit of exploring and common sense to realize which power box to jump into to activate more lights or to stop traffic lights for someone to safely cross the street. The slower paced and relaxing puzzle levels of TurnOn were juxtaposed by racing sequences. During these, players would jump between four different wires at a time, trying to collect as many hovering lightning tokens for points, while avoiding falling to their deaths or hitting the red tokens, which when three were hit, you died.\n\nTurnOn’s art and music were two awesome parts of the game. The lighting in the game feels bright and vibrant due to its contrast with the blackout of the city. The background is painted with a darker color palette of blues and purples, that still give the game a fun and cheerful feeling, without making it feel dark and gloomy. People also populate many of the game’s scenes, usually in distress about one situation or another, all related to the cities’ blackout. This helps the city feel alive, and being able to watch them cheer or enjoy their lives again with your help adds to the satisfaction of completing each puzzle. The music of TurnOn was one of my, dare I say it, turn ons. The casual gameplay and vibrant colors are complimented by the smooth jazz throughout the game. The music during the puzzle scenes adds to the relaxing mood and made this game one of my favorites to come home and play after work. The racing sequences of the game had faster pace music to compliment their gameplay. The developers definitely hit the mark with creating a great atmosphere for their game with the music.\n\nTurnOn is a very enjoyable and relaxing platformer that is great for adults and kids. The colorful art style and smooth jazz music fit well together, while the simple gameplay and dynamic level design made it fun. I did run into two bugs during my playing, but both of the them were easily fixed by simply reloading the level from the previous checkpoints and neither occurred more than once. The developers were quick to respond to my email about the bugs, so I am sure that these minor kinks will be fixed soon.\n\nPros:\n\nColorful art style\n\nRelaxing music\n\nDynamic levels\n\nFun gameplay\n\nController support\n\nSteam Achievements\n\nComic-like narrative\n\nKid friendly\n\nSimple controls\n\nSupport for 18 languages (check Steam for list)\n\nCons:\n\n\nFew bugs (minor and easy to get around)\n\nCharacter does not change size with movement from background to foreground sometimes\n\n\n\nThe developers provided a copy for the game to be reviewed, this did not affect the writer’s opinion of the game.\n\nYou can also check out my team's website : http://www.thegamerholics.com/ .

A pretty cartoony artstyle, some simple controls, and a creative way of traversal Turn On it’s an Indie game with great ideas, and Brainy Studios ,who  at the time of this review, is a team of 4 people, really put the effort into it, and manage to keep me engaged in this cool little platformer. The overall theme could be better explored, and there’s not real challenge for “Hardcore Gamers!”, but it’s a game you should give a chance and try it out. Brainy Studio, you got me Turned On!

There are two styles of levels: one is more of a casual platformer, and the other has some of the aspects you would see in a runner game (like Temple Run, or Bit.Trip Runner).\n\nIn the platforming levels, you move to power up things as you go, and in some levels you are basically escorting the characters through the levels by opening doors, and setting off alarms to scare away the bad guys. Contrary to the casual platforming levels there were other levels that resembled a simpler version of running game. You are forced down the lines with no way to slow down or speed up, and all you can do is jump from one wire to another.\n\nFortunately, there were more platforming levels than runner levels, but I spent a lot of time dying repeatedly on these runner levels. I don’t like runner games, and I admit it’s partially because I just plain suck at them, but I really hated these levels. I found it frustrating to play them, and I felt a sense of dread every time I encountered these levels. It really took away from my overall enjoyment of the game. With how casual the rest of the game feels, and then to have some levels like this eat up so much play time, these levels felt out of place.\n\nUPDATE: There has been a recent patch to address the runner levels being too difficult. [/h](more information)\n\nPros:story is short and sweet\ncute and colourful animation and art style (image boards, and short cinematics)\nthe platforming incorporates using objects in both the foreground and background (it took a bit of getting used to, but I didn’t experience too many issues with the platforming)\ngood, enjoyable, casual platforming levels\nCons:music was good for the most part, but it was fairly repetitive (especially in the areas where you die repeatedly)\nsome very annoying sound effects (i.e. sirens) - but at least you can adjust the volume  UPDATE: Some of these sound effects have had their volume lowered.\nan occasional bug where you could sometimes be able to move around in the air until bumping into something\nthe runner levels feel like there's a lot of pressure on timing; if you don’t jump directly to the wire, you get air time, and are unable to control yourself while in the air, and sometimes not be able to make the next jump\non the runner levels, the controls sometimes felt sluggish after landing, and you couldn’t always jump from the wire, even though you try to UPDATE: The responsiveness of jumps was increased in some runner levels when players try to jump form the very end of wire.\nThe game took me 4-5 hours, with at least an hour and a half of that dying repeatedly. While it wasn’t the most frustrating game I’ve played, I would have probably skipped on playing this game if I had known about the runner levels. At the same time though, I did enjoy the other parts, so I’ve got pretty mixed feelings about the game as a whole.","June 3","false","5.8"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","12","20","2","3"

The game is not very challenging but is a fun game if you want something to sit back and enjoy and not have to worry about tough jumps or time limits. The mechanics are pretty simple as you jump between different power lines in the city to turn the city's electricity back on. The game includes some puzzles which mostly involve exploring to find what you need to turn on in order to proceed. Despite not being much of a challenge, I had a lot of fun with TurnOn.\n\nAnother area where TurnOn excels is its' atmosphere. TurnOn is a really charming game. The graphics are pretty nice especially as the levels light up as you turn on the city's lights. The music fits the mood perfectly. The thing that stood out most to me though was the little storylines in each level. An example is a level where you guide a lost kid back to their house. The main story could have been developed a little more but the game does such a great job creating a charming environment.\n\nWhile I really enjoyed TurnOn I have two issues with the game. As already mentioned the game is really easy. You will breeze through most of the levels. If you are looking for a challenging game, TurnOn is not it. The difficulty leads to the other issue which is the length. Since you can breeze through the levels the game ends up not being very long. I finished the game in around 4.5 hours. Unless you want to go for all of the achievements it will probably take you around the same amount of time to beat the game.\n\nIf you are looking for a really challenging game, you might not like TurnOn but otherwise I would recommend picking it up.\n\nCheck out my full review at http://www.geekyhobbies.com/turnon-indie-game-review/\n","June 3","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
