Winning games against  people doesn't give you that much gold, but the quests you get often will. They range from pretty crappy(do X and get 1500 gold) to insanely valuable(play X games and get 20 packs)\n\n+You can disenchant cards you don't want and craft ones you do. Similar to Hearthstone's system.\n\nCons:\n\n-Servers are unstable(As of Feb 9, 2016 the servers are much more stable, I haven't been d/ced in several days)\n\n-Relatively steep learning curve(I've seen a number of negative reviews where someone was complaining about a mechanic that they clearly did not understand)\n\n-Related to the previous point, there could me more clarity in explaining certain mechanics, such as speed(hover over a card if you're uncertain what it does, there will be a description and a tooltip that explains mechanics associated with the card, like freeze or shock)\n\n-Small(ish) playerbase, you can run into the same person a lot when you're playing friendly/casual matches\n\nImportant issues/questions:\n\nIs the game pay to win??????\n\nNot really. It's more like pay to convenience. If you drop 100 bucks on the game, you will be able to get a ♥♥♥♥load of cards, which will allow you to make a wide variety of decks. However, you don't need to put money into the game to win. Even the Corruption starter deck can take games off of high-tier expensive decks. I personally have been playing for like 2.5 months and I have almost all the cards. I did spend 20 dollars though. However, if you want to be completely f2p, I recommend doing a decent amount of research to find decks you enjoy that are also cheap. I would say that Spellweaver's f2p model is more generous than Hearthstone's, as a point of comparison.\n\nWhat are the "classes" in this game?\n\n-Wisdom: Weird faction, their whole thing is energy/robots/technology. Generally play more midrangey or aggro.\n\n-Nature: Quick units(elves) that like hitting your face, very few big threats.\n\n-Order: Healing and buffing, usually a midrangey style but they also have some of the biggest minions in the game(which can enable them to play controlly).\n\n-Rage: Aggressive SMOrc class with lots of burn. They can also play the midrange game.\n\n-Dominion: Control incarnate. Quite expensive though, wouldn't recommend starting with Dominion.\n\n-Corruption: Evil/undead units that are generally very, very slow. They play aggressively.\n\nHow should I spend my gold?\n\nBuy the 10 card packs that cost 12.5k gold each. Once you're familiar with the game, do trials(basically Arena from Hearthstone). Probably best to avoid trials until you're decently experienced.\n\nWhat if I don't want to play against people with full decks? Can I still do quests?\n\nYeah, almost all of the quests can be done against AI opponents.\n\nADVICE:\n\nPick corruption for your starting deck. Just do it. It's super easy to play and is probably the strongest starter deck. You could also pick Wisdom and make a tempo wisdom deck(google it), which can be very strong. It's a bit difficult to play though.\n\nAs soon as you're able, change the number of shrines in your deck to 20. The starter decks have 23, which is too many.\n\nGoogle something like "spellweaver free gold". MMObomb has a promotion where they're giving away keys that give you 100k gold in Spellweaver. This is worth about 15 bucks. As of right now, I think there are like 26k keys left. If you don't wanna make an account on mmobomb to get the key, just google what I mentioned earlier. People seem to be posting keys in random ♥♥♥ places(I got mine from some random website called whosgamingnow or something). Obviously, there could be some sketchy sites that come up in the search so be careful. If you do this and the tutorial, you get 125k gold, which will buy you 10 packs(each pack has 10 cards and is guaranteed 1 rare card or more).\n\nIf you want to include skill shrines into your deck(essentially lands that give your hero a skill), put in 3 at most. 4 is almost always overkill and you'll find yourself with it being dead in your hand often.\n\nIf you care about graphics/polish over gameplay, then you should not play this game. It does not have anywhere near the level of polish that Hearthstone does.\n\nIf you don't like complex games, stay away from this one. The depth of strategy and execution is far greater than that of Hearthstone. If you're someone who enjoys MtG, you'll probably enjoy Spellweaver. If you're someone who likes games simple/casual and easy to jump into, you probably will not like Spellweaver.","February 4","true","3.2"," 66 of 70 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","66","70","2","4"

Definitely worth a try for every fan of card games.\n\nPros:\nlarge variety in terms of deck building (the 6 colours can be freely combined)\nthe speed, and front and support row systems shake up traditional CCG combat a bit\ngenerous quest system\nunlimited deck slots (no Blizzard, more than 9 doesn't confuse us)\nhas a mechanic to mitigate resource screw/flood\ntournament and spectator mode\nleaderboards, which show the exact ranking of every player playing ranked\nbeautiful artwork (at least imo)\nNeutral\nit takes a few hours to unlock features like crafting or Trials (similar to HS arena)\nvery little RNG (no BS but also no great highlight reel material)\nCons:\nfairly steep learning curve\nsingle player campaigns not yet implemented\noptions menu is really lacking\nsome minor bugs here and there-------------------------------------------------------------------\nread on for more in depth information:\nThe combat system functions similar to MtG, but with a few twists. You can directly target your opponents creatures with attacks. However each creature has a speed stat, ranging from 1 to 4, in addition to health and attack. A creature can only ever attack or block a creature with the same or lower speed. A higher speed means more flexibility in combat but comes at the price of lower stats or higher cost.\nCreatures can move freely between a front and support line (except when they have previously attacked this turn). While a creature is protected from attacks in the support line, it also can't attack or block itsself, which makes it the perfect place for small creatures with key effects. An exception to this are flying creatures, which can attack as well as block while in the support line.\n\nThis game is really generous. You don't have to spend a dime and you can still build a competitive deck in about a week with semi-casual play. As you play you automatically unlock new starter decks and the corresponding faction's quest zones. From unlocking all zones alone you get multiple rares (second highest rarity) and one epic (highest rarity) of every faction. Every 8 hours a variety of quests spawn in one faction zone from which you can choose one. Rewards range from small amounts of gold, a few common or uncommon cards or small packs (4 cards) to 12 pack boxes, rare and epic cards (no duplicates) or premium currency. There's also the academy, which gives you a really good quest once every 3 days.\nIn the draft mode Trials, which you can enter for a fee, you break even after 3 wins (50% win rate) and at the max of 10 wins you get rewards, which are worth more than 7 times the entry fee (including 5 packs).\n\nFor those who want to spend a few bucks there are custom card backs or premium packs, which have higher chances for epics and will not give you cards you already have 4 of (max number which can be included in a deck).\n","February 2","true","177.5"," 43 of 51 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","43","51","2","3"

I've also played Jyhad, some Netrunner, Infinity Wars, Hearthstone etc. I was looking for an online TCG that would satisfy me for a long while and I feel this could be it.\n\nSpellweaver is not shallow when it comes to the gameplay itself. It feels a lot like Magic, but slightly different. It adds some depth here and there, while removing some of the aspects that make Magic seem complicated to beginners (such as the stack). The result is satisfying, it doesn't feel like the game or your deck plays itself like in some other TCGs, it never feels like RNG is determining the outcome of the game and although it's still early it feels like a good competitive scene could be built on this game.\n\nThe factions are interesting, with clear strengths and weaknesses as well as themes. The software itself is good and I haven't encoutered any major bugs. The occasional server problem still happens, but they usually don't last long and you can simply continue the match if it was interrupted. UI is clear and easy to use, although I'm not a fan of the separation of the Decks and Collection tab. Deckbuilder is not too bad either, but MODO's still my favorite. Animations are present, but short and unintrusive.\n\nIf you don't like the excessive simplicity of Hearthstone and aren't happy with the limitations and problems of Magic Duels, give this a try.  It's not a shoddy, poorly thought out card game like most online TCGs and it's not just a bland clone like HEX.\n\nPS: you can't chat with your opponent, only with people on your friends list. Silly limitation and I find it hard to justify it, but I guess that's the trend now - playing online but without human interaction.

The ingame tutorial is straightforward, explains every move with clear sentences and moves you back to the last move if you happen to misplay somehow.\n\nYou have 6 aspects/factions you can freely mix together and create endless variations of decks thanks to that.

At least not since Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone...both of which can be considered direct influences for Spellweaver. This game is best described as a cross between the two, and it's very easy to see why. 100% free-to-play, Spellweaver is an exciting collectible card game with tons of cards to collect, and plenty of ways to build and strategize with the cards you earn.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nAs said above, this game plays out almost exactly like the two card games that influenced it. You begin with a very basic collection of cards. You start with a few beginners decks, and you can earn more as you progress. Once you've earned (or crafted!) more cards and are confident enough, you can even build your own signature deck. Once you have an opponent (either in the form of AI to complete quests or other players), you both draw a starter hand. If you do not like the hand, you are given one chance to redraw it. Now the beginning of the game is crucial, as if you do not have enough mana/land cards, you cannot do anything for awhile...which leaves you wide open to attack from your opponent. You have 2 resources you need to manage in Spellweaver: Levels and Mana. Using "land" cards, you can either increase your Level by 1 (which allow higher level cards to be played), or increase your max mana by 1 AND draw another card.\n\nOnce you have a small supply of land built up, you can start wrecking havoc with creatures, spells, and Hero abilities. Much like M:TG, your creatures have Life and Attack power, as well as a speed rating. Creatures can only attack other creatures of the same or lower speed rating as themselves. In your turn, you can declare an attack, lining up your creatures to attacks yuour opponent's creatures, or your opponent directly. You also get the chance to use spells if you have any.\n\nI'm not going to go TOO much into detail on how the game plays, as they would absolutely fill up this review, but the above is more or less the gist of it. Just know that it's very important to manage your resources and be aware of what's on the field at all times. You can hover your mouse over any card you can see to zoom in on it and read its effects at anytime, should you need to. And you will. A lot. Also keep in mind that RNG plays a huge role in whether you win or lose, as no matter what cards you load into your deck you might not draw them when you need them. But this is true of any card game, really.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nSpellweaver doesn't look too shabby, but don't expect graphics along the lines of Halo or Mass Effect. The art on each card is very well drawn, and you'll find yourself looking at each card just to admire the art at times. The overall look and feel of the game is very colorful and vibrant.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThere's not much to say here, Spellweaver has a few tracks that play during duels, and on the "World Map" where you choose your battles. Once you get caught up in a duel, you probably won't notice the music at all. You will however, notice the sounds of spell effects, as well as the shuffling of cards...which can get a tad annoying after awhile. Not too much to really turn you off of playing, at least not for me.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nThe game ran pretty well, although it isn't too flashy in the graphics department so it won't put much pressure on your own rig (hopefully). Best played with a mouse, and you can do so with just one hand (Ha!). My game ran at around 60FPS, but it really doesn't REQUIRE anything more than 20, being the type of game it is.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nIf you like card games in the vein of Magic or Hearthstone, do yourself a favor and give Spellweaver a try. It's easy enough to pickup and is quite challenging despite your experience level. Also while the game DOES have microtransactions, you can earn all the currency you need to buy packs or card backs within the game via quests without spending a dime of real life money. Though if you like the game, I'd say it wouldn't hurt to throw the devs a few bucks for card packs as a sort of thank you for making such a nice game!\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bzp6k8tXAoQ\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","April 4","true","13.0"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","27","34","0","0"

It's an ambitious project that I think will be very attractive if they get around to implmenting the MMO Conquest mode (this isn't yet funded but is on their dev roadmap). The design and balance is well thoughtout, massively superior to most CCGs out there. I think I'd argue it has all the nuance of MtG. Over time I expect the themed expansions will add huge flexibility.\n\nPros:\n+ Well designed combat mechanics\n+ Broad range of early playstyles across the factions\n+ Cool heroes who add unique flavor and flexibility to decks\n+ The artwork and music are solid\n+ AI scales well between modes\n\nMixed:\n+/- You buy cards, some people will hate that.

This is a high quality game, in the same vein as "Spectromancer" ( free on Kongregate ) and "Infinity Wars".\n\n"Spellweaver" features 4 different speed types for creatures ( think of a slow, lumbering giant or hydra that does massive damage, versus a swift elf that does lower damage - kind of like David versus Goliath ).\n\nA lot of thought was put into overcoming mana problems. Lands ( shrines ) create both coloured and colourless mana, which become fixed, depending on your choice ( depending on the cards in your hand ). You also have the option to dump a card from your hand, draw 5 cards at random from your deck, and pick one land ( shrine ) if any - a mechanic that takes advantage of modern computing power.\n\nPros:\n\n- Once you get over the learning curve of the game's speed mechanics, and timing of spells, the game becomes very absorbing.\n\n- I love the artwork and the music is nice. My favourite card art:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/m0nfgc0upd0vpsm/Flash%20of%20Delerium.jpg?dl=0\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/sx07j18fcenwxv5/Dreyla.jpg?dl=0\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/jngm5xx4aip9f1d/Fae%20Of%20Charm.jpg?dl=0\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/bmvctcx2rk360pz/Forcemage.jpg?dl=0\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/0p1ol2jeaxiaxrq/Charged%20Aurite.jpg?dl=0\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/qzyfg3yt49yef56/Mescatian%20Phoenix.jpg?dl=0\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/w8zzhgm1ozj1vvu/ProtectorOfTheInnocent.jpg?dl=0\n\n- The developers are very generous. You get a free booster deck every 5 levels, starting with level zero. By the time I was level 10, I had three different decks and made a couple of interesting dual-colour, combo decks. You can go on quests and gain gold and booster packs. Tips for beginners: buying "Normal" packs of 10 random cards for 12,500 gold is the best value for in-game money. In the beginning you might focus on good or evil packs but those cost 17,500 gold for 10 cards.\n\n- You can practice against AI of different difficulties and they are somewhat Godly on Expert or Inhumane difficulty.\n\n- I found a game at any time of day, even at 4:30 am ( North American Eastern time ) 1 minute queue time rather than 20 seconds, during peak time. If you don't want to wait, there is always AI.\n\n- Gets very addictive around level 5. I've been playing for 36+ hours straight. I passed out at my keyboard, min-maxing and re-designing my decks. I had just finished an "Epic Quest" ( 55 PVP battles ) and won a 12-pack box ( 12 x Normal Packs = 120 cards total ). Then I stumbled to the washroom before my pants filled up:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNsMgl9KKIA\n\n- I recently noticed that there is crafting ( to craft missing cards ) trials ( drafting ) and public tournaments. I just finished my first Trial ( a draft game against other human opponents ). The competition is top notch in Trials, which is fantastic. Two entry tickets were given to me for free by the developers, so based on my final performance ( 2 losses, 1 win and a final loss ) I ended up winning 2 x small packs + 1,000 gold.\n\nCons:\n\n- The game mechanics regarding speed are confusing at first, so there is a bit of a learning curve, via trial and error.\n\n- The card sets are currently tiny: around 31 different cards per colour. More cards are coming out in a few months.\n\n- After playing for 36-48 hours straight, I got bored of seeing the same colours utilizing the same mechanics. I wish that there was a format for larger, pre-constructed decks ( I like to use 80- 100 dual-colour card decks. 100 card libraries are the maximum size and 60 cards are the minimum deck size ). Streamlined, 60 card decks are fun to make but they eventually get boring to play with or against. When I played Magic: The Gathering, my friends and I would use 2,000 card, rainbow libraries.\n\n- The server is occasionally, annoyingly flaky giving you a, "You were disconnected from the server" errors ( usually a problem while trying to login to the game but a couple of times, I've been disconnected during a game ). If you were playing versus AI, the game state is saved. If you were playing versus a human, you have to try and login as soon as possible, otherwise the computer will pass your turn within seconds. The developers have been working on this game for 4 years, so it's a bit odd that this problem exists but I'm sure that given time, the problem will be rectified.\n\nSpellweaver roadmap: https://spellweaver-tcg.com/roadmap/\n\nOther:\n\n100,000 free Gold on MMObomb ( enough to buy 2.5 booster decks or 8 normal packs ):\n\nhttp ://www.mmobomb.com/giveaway/spellweaver-free-gold\n\n22764 KEYS LEFT!","February 16","true","138.6"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"

This is it.\nPick Dominion first.\n\nSpellweaver has many features that make it one of the best, if not the best digital ccg out now.  You can fully customize your deck, which is a great improvement over hearthstone where you're limited to only your class cards and neutral cards.  This is kept in check with their equivalent of magic's color system.  In Spellweaver there are two main resources: levels and mana.  Your deck consists of Shrines creatures and spells.  Spells and creatures are virtually the same as Magic or Hearthstone the shrines are what makes this game different.\n\nUnlike hearthstone you don't get mana automatically every turn instead you can play a shrine which can give you a level in its particular discipline or a mana crystal and draw a card.  If you are low on shrines, you can use a once a turn ability to exchange a card from your hand to look for a shrine in the top 5 cards in your deck.  These features help prevent the problems magic has of mana flood or mana screw.\n\nGold accumulation is acceptable in this game and better than hearthstone I'd say.  You accumulate gold for all games you play as well as a bonus for going up player levels.  In addition to games and bonuses, there are also quests which can reward cards, packs, gold or sometimes crystals (the pay only currency).  The pack accumulation rate is about one for every thirteen ranked games won. (I've found I get about 1000 gold on average for winning a ranked game) and you get half gold if you lose, which is way better than hearthstone at one pack for every 30 wins.\n\nGive it a download and try it.\n\nPick Dominion to start.

It uses a free to play model with the option of spending real money for packs. Unlike other games in the genre, the free to play option appears viable. I myself have spent $0.00 and have a full collection. It takes some grinding, but nowhere near the grinding of other CCGs. The quest system gives grinders a never-ending series of fun, short-term goals to shoot for as you build your collection and power over time. If you do buy packs, they are reasonably priced at around $1.50 for 10 cards (including a rare or epic).\n\nSpellweaver captures the addicting deck and card design of Magic better than any other game on the market - and I've played them all. The "level" system makes building two and three color decks fun and fair, even with a limited collection. The ease of going 2+ colors dramatically increases deck diversity, even if the current card pool is fairly limited (about 215 total cards or therabouts). At the same time, Spellweaver has  quick, easy to understand, and rewarding game play. An hour after installing, you'll have two or three fun decks ready to build, tweak, and play.\n\nOf course, the game isn't perfect. The social side of things is a work in progress, including in-game chat. The card art is pretty good, but other art assets lack the shine and flair of other CCGs. I look forward to the game getting more polish around the edges and another few hundred cards (they're coming, but not immediately).\n\nOverall, I promise you the game is worth your $0.00. If you are a fan of the genre or looking to start, give Spellweaver a try. It's fun, strategic, and far less predatory than a certain well-known competitior.\n\n*Note: I've played about 100 hours on the non-steam version.","February 2","true","24.8"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","0"

With the release of Spellweaver, it faces some serious competition.\n\nUnlike Infinity Wars, which embraces the potential of the digital format to the fullest, Spellweaver is an exceedingly old-fashioned CCG, which should really appeal to people who actually flopped cardboard back in the old days of the CCG boom. The game doesn't track creature stats independantly; buffs are either "until end of turn" only, applied by persistant enchantments that can be destroyed, or restricted to permanent counters. There are no RNG effects beyond the natural randomness of card draw. Token creatures vanish rather than going to the graveyard, and a creature stolen from its owner will still return to their graveyard, hand or deck, not that of the thief, if it dies, is bounced, or stacked on a deck. Even something as simple as Mind Extortion (a card that forces the opponent to discard a spell or artifact of your choice) will still reveal the opponent's entire hand to you rather than just any spells or artifacts they're holding, just like in a real game.\n\nOf course, this doesn't make Spellweaver a simplistic game. Far from it. Spellweaver is easily the MOST complicated and elaborate digital CCG I've ever found- in large part because of the excessively-streamlined (or, if you're being harsh, "dumbed down") features of common digital CCGs it DOESN'T use. For one thing, while the game uses a hero system similar to Duel of Champions or Hearthstone, multifaction deck building is back. The game has 6 factions (5 mostly analagous to white, black, blue, red and green from Magic with the addition of the purple 'Dominion' faction) and you can have as few or as many in your deck as you want. There are NO neutral cards, only faction ones. The ability to play up to a 6-faction deck (there's even an achievement for winning with one) gives you almost infinite deckbuilding possibilities- each faction has their own strengths and weaknesses and you can combine them at will as long as you manage your level curve properly. Each faction also has 3 different heroes to choose from, each with their own unique power, which can further shape your strategy. The possibilities are as endless as your imagination.\n\nAdditionally, the game uses a tangible resource system similar to lands in Magic requiring you to stock your deck with Shrine cards, rather than the oversimplified "everyone starts at 1 mana and gains 1 per turn" system. Shrines can either be played to increase your maximum mana by one, or raise your faction level, a requirement you have to meet to be able to play cards, but the real beauty of the system that elevates it above Magic's land system is that a shrine played for mana (but NOT level) will also let you draw a card to replace itself, severely reducing the effects of hitting a glut of resource cards and keeping your deck and hand ticking over, while also forcing you to make meaningful choices about when to raise your mana and when to gain another level to play more powerful cards. The addition of Divine Offering, an ability any player can use to put a card from their hand on the bottom of their deck in exchange for fishing in the top 5 cards of their deck for any shrine, goes a long way to reducing the number of times you're going to get "shrine screwed", as well as making it easier to find the right shrine you need to increase a faction level at the right time.\n\nThe most significant difference between Spellweaver and other digital CCGs, and the one which in my opinion puts it above the rest, is that it trusts players to be able to interact on each others' turns. Hearthstone, for example, has completely and utterly removed every last trace of interactivity when it's not your turn- after you click the 'End Turn' button you might as well unplug your mouse for all the difference it makes. Not so with Spellweaver. While it steps away from the Magic standard and closer to other CCGs by allowing you to attack enemy creatures directly, the defending player chooses blocking assignments and can intercept your attacks with their unassigned creatures (once you allow for speed, an additional stat all creatures have which determines what they're allowed to attack or block). There are 2 points on your opponent's turn where YOU are actually allowed to play instant spells or activate abilities on cards in play (another feature that has been phased out of a lot of digital CCGs which prefer creatures to only be able to attack or have automatic abilities)- during your opponent's attack phase when you're assigning defenders, allowing you to play a Pacifism and shuffle their attacker back into their deck or an Ambush Strike and buff your little weenie up to be big enough to kill your opponent's now outclassed attacker, and after they end their turn, allowing you to spend that unspent mana you were saving now that it's too late for your opponent to do anything about it but before your turn starts. There are a myriad of strategies available to the Spellweaver player, a kick to the crotch of all online CCG developers who think modern gamers are too dumb to handle any strategies above the basic.\n\nAnother thing I love about Spellweaver, and another thing that goes against not only modern digital CCG wisdom but even old traditional game design principles, is that there are no outright bad cards. You heard me, THERE ARE NO DELIBERATELY CRAPPY CARDS. Sure, some cards are stronger than others, and some are only useful in specific strategies and decks, and yes there is a meta, but there are NO cards that were created deliberately, unplayably crap just to pad out the card list. The down side of this is that the base set is necessarily smaller than you might expect (around the 180-200 card mark across all 6 factions), but if this just means you can build up a full collection that much easier without accumulating a towering pile of garbage you are never, ever going to use, then more power to it.\n\nSpellweaver is also one of THE most generous F2P CCGs I've ever played. I have almost a full set after only a few weeks of play, and I haven't spent a cent on it. I hope it's not TOO generous, actually, because they're probably undercutting themselves.\n\nSpellweaver isn't perfect, of course, no game is. There are a few flaws worth mentioning, most notably how opaque some of the gameplay mechanics are. The tutorial is good enough to let you pick up the basics of play, but there are a HUGE number of subtleties you can only learn through hard-fought experience, as well as several obscure mechanics (Deadly creatures only do 1 damage to each creature they fight because that's all they need to do to kill them, undermining gang-attack mechanics where you would normally have the first attacker soak the defender's damage for the others). Balance is currently a matter of concern thanks to Dominion being, quite simply, the strongest faction, but the devs are looking at that. And the sheer old-fashioned-ness of the game may not appeal to players used to "smarter" games where they don't have to worry about as many details. But these are minor flaws and can be easily overlooked by a dedicated CCG player.\n\nSpellweaver is a hardcore, old-fashioned CCG that doesn't hold your hand and gives you the scope to use your tactical mind to its full potential, free of the shackles of automated play and RNG-dependency. It's brilliant already and promises to get even better as it goes on. I don't even have room to tell you fully how great it is, this review doesn't have enough words to tell you about the daily system or the tournament system or draft play. Just take my word for it.

Review continues below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw_pdgEGfNE\n\n____________________________________________\n\nThis game plays as a perfect blend of the styles of Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone. For instance, combat plays out very much like Hearthstone, but each unit's health heals to full after combat (if it isn't defeated; like in MtG). There's also a "mana" system like in MtG. It goes into a pool rather than a stack of cards, but otherwise it works pretty much the same way.\n\nIt's a joy to play even at this early stage, and it seems that you can (at least at this point) get by just fine without spending a dime (though there are some rather expensive item packs in the menus). The tutorial really needs to be improved- if I wasn't already familiar with the genre I would have been totally lost. Graphics are good. The music is fantastic, I even let it continue playing while I had the game minimized, doing internet browsing and writing this review.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nedit: TL; DR: If you know you like this sort of game, give this a shot.

Spellweaver gets all of those points right:\n\n1) Just like in MtG, lands are used to produce mana and you can have cards from multiple classes, but there is a lot more deck control in Spellweaver, so you very rarely run out of lands to place.\n\n2) In Hearthstone the attacker would always choose who he attacks, and in Magic the defender would always decide. In Spellweaver, they have a speed stat for each creature, and higher speed creatures can block lower speed creatures; if they are not blocked they can attack whatever they want. It's a nice compromise that also adds some room for card diversity.\n\n3) Instants exist in Spellweaver (and so add more depth to the game), but they don't slow the game down because they can only be played at certain times. So you get most of the depth of instants without having to pass priority after every card.\n\n\n\nThe game suffers a little from its low budget (the kickstarter only got $10k when the final goal was $15k, and it's made by a 5-man dev team that took 4 years to release it):\n\n1) It's not too pretty. The card art is mediocre, worse than MtG or hearthstone imo. There are very few animations, i.e. if someone plays a card that says they instantly win you will only see the win screen, not how they won. The sounds are also fairly repetitive and lackluster.\n\n2) You can't chat in-game. You can add friends and then chat after, but still.\n\n3) The game has a pretty small playerbase, so they might stop developing it at some point... :/","February 18","true","117.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I loved the original game but eventually became disheartened with the reprints, card bans and constant rule/mechanic changes. The constant changes and additions to the rules and mechanics basically force you to continually throw money at WoTC just so you can keep playing.\n\nThese days I stick mostly to deck builders where you can just buy a game box and the occasional casual online TCG. I played Hearthstone and while the aesthetic was interesting, I quickly grew bored with it. It seems like more of a crap shoot than a card game. Spellweaver seems to arrive at a happy compromise between the aesthetics and mechanics of Hearthstone and MTG.\n\nIf you have played either Hearthstone, MTG or both then Spellweaver should be fairly simple to pick up.\n\nThe card shop's balance between game currency and real cash seems fair. It gives you something to work for without inhibiting basic gameplay. It's also nice that you can buy packs that contain cards from specific set groups to make it easier to fill your favorite deck. However, if you want to build THEE killer/pro deck, it will likely cost you time or money.","February 6","true","9.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","0"

As a long time MTG player, this is shaping up to be everything that Duels should have been! It's not in any way a direct clone of MTG, though it uses the same concepts as haste, first strike, lifelink, etc. But it also adds zones to the playfield, a speed attribute (which is very nice) on all creatures, new combat mechanics, as well as a more streamlined manabase (you'll still occasionally get manascrewed, but it is much much more fair, and less random).\n\nPros:\n-Extremely fair f2p model. I'm actually worried if the devs can make money this way. Unfortunately, they purchases available seem pretty expensive, but since you don't need to buy anything at all to rather quickly collect a very sizeable set of cards, it's not an issue.\n-Drafting already implemented\n-tournaments running as well\n-SO much designspace for expansions\n\nCons:\n\n-Few cards currently - It is a bit hard to make to monocolored decks of the same color that does not play sort of similar.

The implementation of an extra color for non-control Black magic,  flying tiers (called speed), WoW TCG heroes/hero powers and a permanent, once a turn scry-5-for-land mechanic, plus making card-draw a universal perk of all colors gives it a definitely fast-paced environment where luck is minimized and skill differences can be noticed even in subtle ways. In a nutshell, it has both a lower skill floor and in some areas a higher skill ceiling than Magic.\n\nIt's very young, the developers are active and so generous this game is a Play-to-Win. Note the PLAY. I jumped right in trying to find something that could entertain me for an hour or two every now and then, and haven't been able to put it down at all. It's a testament to the developers' ability to take beloved and famous game mechanics and make them feel new, feel modern again.\n\nMore than worth a try.

I think this is the best offering of card games that are inspired by MtG, and I've played many. There are only a few changes and additions to the game mechanics here, but they are critical to making this a better game.\n\nThe creature speed ratings is really cool - some slow but hard hitting creatures can devastate your opponent, unless he manages to get out faster creatures that your slow poke can't block or directly attack. Faster creatures give more flexability but are generally less powerful.\n\nThe Shrines for mana is nice too. You can play them for a "level up" in that color, which is functionally similar to a spell that requires more than one of a mana color to cast. Or you can spend it for +1 mana which is functionally similar to a basic land in MtG, but here it also gives you a card draw. It includes the chance to have a resource advantage without the 'mana screw' that can really ruin an otherwise fun game of MtG. Keeping this system in play means you still need to make decisions about your mana base in deckbuilding; you can try to run slim and get more utility cards in your deck, but you are putting yourself at resource risk.\n\nBut hey, it is FREE and has lots of good content at 100% free.

Spellweaver is a combination between Magic the Gathering, Hearthstone and Hex, but has a feel that is distinctly its own.\n\nPros:\n+ You can attack individual creatures like in Hearthstone, and you can interact with the opponent on their turn with instant spells and effects like in Magic.\n+ The speed system. Creatures have a speed stat that varies from 1 to 4, and can attack and intercept only creatures with a speed that is equal to or lower than their own speed. All creatures can intercept other creatures, similarly to how Protectors could intercept other creatures in WoW TCG.\n+ The two-row system. There's a front row and a support row. Creatures on the front row can attack but also be attacked, whereas creatures on the support row are safe from attacks but cannot attack. Flying creatures are the only ones that can attack from the support row.\n+ The Divine Offering mechanic. With Divine Offering, once per turn, you can put a card from your hand on the bottom of the deck, look at the top five cards of the deck, put a resource card in your hand and the rest on the bottom.\n+ The hero system. The game revolves around heroes, each having a unique skill like in Hex. Heroes can also acquire additional skills (up to three) with special resource cards.\n+ The quest system, which is more generous than in any online card game I've played (maybe too generous). Quests have rarity just like cards (common, uncommon, rare and epic), with rarer ones giving better rewards, including packs and rare/epic cards.\n+ The developers and the community. I like it that the developers are active on the game's forum and constantly engage with the community, and that they take advantage of the digital medium and constantly strive to improve and balance it.\n\n(Actually there's more, but I seem to have reached the word limit.)\n\nCons:\n- The number of cards is rather small at the moment.\n- Some server issues. Hopefully they'll be fixed soon.\n- The tutorial is not that great.\n- You can only chat with people in your friends list.\n\nThe game is still in its infancy, but I think its long-term potential is huge.

Good game play with numerous deck strategies avaialable, and this is just with the basic set so far. The game play is pretty smooth and the UI is intuitive and looks great. The cards themselves also feature great artwork.\n\nMost Free-to-play digital CCGs require you to dump some cash into the game or spend a ridiculous amount of time grinding to earn cards. Spellweaver is fairly generous with the availability of cards and in game gold used to buy packs, and the crafting system means you can get a couple of key cards you need for your ideal deck without relying on the randomness of opening packs. Very early on I had enough cards to tweak my starter, and in no time I was able to start constructing my own decks, which is the real meat of a CCG for me. I DID end up spending some money on the game, but that was more to support the game than to be competetive. And for those who want to support the game with out feeling like they're buying an advantage, you can buy cosmetic upgrades like card sleaves. I'm more inclined to spend money on games like this when I don't feel like I need to, and when the game is so good I want it to suceed.\n\nHeroes start with a basic skill. You can add additional skills and choose your aspects as you wish (though your basic skill will require levels in your hero's native aspect). I particularly love the speed stat on creatures, which can make for some tricky decisions on when and how to attack, and the divine offering feature, that allows you to sacrifice a card in hand to get a chance at a shrine(these produce mana, skills, and aspect levels). Energy traits on cards also allow for some interesting mechanics (knowledge makes heavy use of these, though other aspects have it as well). You have multiple game options, from varying difficulty AI matches, friendly matches with human opponents, ranked matches to get on the leaderboard, tournaments, draft trials, and sometimes special PvE events as quests.

When you combine all of that you get a unique game and feel that has everything a player needs, and I hope it will continue to evolve because it has the potential to be big.\n\n6 aspects that you can combine is obviously taken from MTG and thats awesome because evry person can pick an aspect to their playstalye or combine more to make the perfect deck. Combining summoning cost of cards, number of same colored aspects and crystals  (I wont say they took that from heartstone because this game was in develop for 4 years and heartsont came our 2 years ago) really puts your brain to work how to combine and balance them out. For now pretty much 2-3 same colored aspects are enough (or i didnt see any cards that use more than 4 same colored aspecsts). So for new players its really easy to pick it up (tho you need to do some card reading and trying out to figure how the cards exactly work), and for some veteran TCG players they can go in depth big time. The hero powers and the menu/gold/fame and shop style are taken from Might and Magic Duel of Champions and imo its the best shop style. Want to buy cards? Play a lot and gain gold (gold gain is moderate not too quick or too slow). Wanna buy cards fast? Give real money, and thats more than fair because the game is free to play. I will at one point start buying packs just for the reason to support the game and not to get cards because they deserved every bit of it.\n\nEdit: Just please if you get the time think about putting offline play.

While it does have a p2w model, the f2p model is well designed. You aren't gated with energy or the like. Wins against the AI grant around 200-300 gold while packs cost 12k. You also get additional gold and cards from daily quests you can unlock.\n\nCons: In addition to the serious server issues (dc's, major lag, etc). The rules can be a bit rough to learn as the tutorial doesn't go in depth to the different mechanics involved with blocking. MTG players can also get a little off guard with abilities such as flying which prevents you from being attacked but does not offer evasion. The only serious complaint I have is their servers.","February 4","true","22.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

I like the idea of being able to shift creatures around and to break through the enemy lines with speed. Spellweaver takes the idea of strategy in a TCG and turns it up to 11 with having to manage speed, front line and support line, and order level. All of these new concepts combine to make each turn an opportunity to turn the tide of a match. Spellweaver is designed for the players who enjoy the strategic depth of classic MTG and the freedom of deckbuilding.\n\nPros:\nCharming Presentation\nTons of Strategy\nRobust deckbuilding\nReally good tutorial\nFair pay model\nNew concepts like speed, positioning, and order levels\n\nCons:\nLimited player base\nBalance issues\nSmall card pool\n\nSpellweaver marries the depth and strategy of MTG to the charm and simplistic nature of Hearthstone to create a fun and unique take on the digital TCG genre.\n\nIf you want a quick look at the new concepts that Spellweaver adds to TCG genre then check out my video \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPgPI_eXwl4&ab_channel=HammyD","February 18","true","8.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

There are daily quests and there is no limit to the amount of gold you can collect (without paying). Also, while leveling, you get a lot of free stuff, like gold, card decks and booster packs. For a small card pack you have to win 20 matches against the AI or 5 matches in ranked. Which is fair.\n\n2) It is balanced?\nNo, in it's current stage the game is not yet balanced. Certain factions have better cards and more synergy. But this is only really noticeable against high ranking players. As a casual player you'll probably not have many issues. Something I personally had an issue with was bad opening hands. The RNG can be pretty annoying sometimes.\n\n3) What sets it apart from the other card games?\nYou won't find anything new here. You can test your skills against players using your own deck in a friendly match, ranked match or in tournaments held every few days or you could also just play against the AI. Alternatively, you can play trials in which you construct a deck on the fly (draft) and try to win 10 games. Finally, you can do the daily quests and level up your character for extra rewards.\n\n\nOverall it's a pretty interesting game.","March 28","true","78.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

But although there are noticeable similarities, it is a very different game. The only problem I have so far is server instability. I get disconnected a ton and this results in lost games. I cannot bring myself to invest any actual money into the game until I feel secure that it will not be wasted due to server instability. Aside from that. The quest/free to play system for earning your cards is nice and balanced. I am not sure why so many of these virtual card games do not include a trading aspect. Who cares if people start selling singles its just going to make your pack sales increase. Instead there is a decent crafting system, where you use your mana sources, similar to lands in MTG, as a currency to break down and create new cards. If you are a card game and strategy fan then I highly recommend giving this a go.","February 23","true","264.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

A really awesome baby.\n\nThe mechanics are similar to both titles and the card art is gorgeous. The free to play model is fair I find and I'll go into detail on that shortly.\n\nAs you play matches you earn gold (Free Earnable Currency) and fame (XP) You can play against AI or against other people and have the option of playing Friendly matches or Ranked games that give you a rating. All cards can be earned through just playing the game and it doesnt feel like your being drip fed a miniscule amount of currency to reach that goal of obtaining more cards and decks.\n\nThe deck Building is similar to Magic the Gathering in that you have multiple colours to choose from each with their own gimmicks and playstyles, You can mix them up how you see fit and create a customised deck suited to your playstyle.\n\nUpon first entering the game you are given a choice of 1 of the 6 starter decks available (Which are still somewhat competitive against real people even without adding in cards earned through quests or buying with real money I might add)\n\nUpon reaching level 5 (Roughly a couple hours of gameplay for me) You are given another starter deck and this is were the fun begins.. You can mix your two starter decks together to create a duo element deck as I touched on earlier.\n\nFor instance my Order deck (White token and flying focused for those that play MTG) and my newly acquired Nature deck (Elven Aggro which consists of low cost fast creatures and instant speed spells) were mixed together to create a deck that has more options instead of sticking to a set one trick pony strategy and allowing for more variation in what you can do in your player matches.\n\nAs you level up you will acquire Rewards for doing so, such as Gold and Packs you could otherwise purchase on the store.\n\nNormal Packs contain 10 random cards and there are also good and evil Booster packs if your looking to get something from those specific factions. Good = Order,Nature and Wisdom/  Evil = Rage, Corruption and Dominion.\n\nThere is also a draft format with tournaments being held for prizes and these are unlocked later as you level.\n\nRanked matches are unlocked at level 3 giving you time to be eased into the game and learn its mechanics.\n\nAll in all I really recommend this game, It's free, Fun and you don't have to spend a penny to have a good time although if you want to support the devs I recommend purchasing a double box for either good or evil depending on the factions you want to play with.\n\nThis is easily my favourite card game as of now.. Yugioh, Pokemon, Hearthstone and Shadow Era (A f2p Card game similar to this) Havn't given me as much fun as this and I loved playing those games over the years.\n\nDo yourself a favour, Download this 500mb Gem of a game and try it out for yourself, If your a fan of card games you wont be disappointed!","February 17","true","13.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

As an FNM-level magic player, i definitely recomment it over any other f2p ccg games i have seen on steam. It borrows just the right things from both Hearthstone and MTG, and its unique mechanics like the energy system and speed system are actually easy to figure out, and fun to use. Currently, it still suffers from various bugs (although the creators are eager to fix them), but like all similar games, if it wants to survive on the long run, it requires content updates, both which Magic: Duels and Hearthstone offer, which can be a big dealbreaker.","February 3","true","23.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

The artwork in this game = AMAAAZING)\n\nPeople say it is a mix of mtg with hearthstone but in my opinion it is alot closer to mtg, except SPELLWEAVER IS BETTER!!\nThere's a "divine offering" tool that helps eliminate mana screw and even your basic shrines ( lands ) draw you a card which also helps.\nthe combat system is unique to the genre where like in hearthstone you choose which creatures you want to attack but then the defender can also save his creatures by swapping them with any other creatures he has left over. the combat also has a front and support row and includes a new "speed" stat that creatures now have that all add strtegic depth to the gameplay.\n\nThere are plenty of things that you can buy but the game is in no way ,shape, or form a pay to win game. without paying a single cent on the game it is fairly easy to collect all the copies you need of every card in the game because it is so generous with quest rewards that range from gold to crystals to even getting your self a twelve pack box for playing ten games (A rare quest but by no means impossible to get)\n\nJust like other card games, every once in a while a card will appear or will have been buffed/changed and it will be the OP thing of the game that the community likes to hate on BUT UNLIKE other card games the awesome dev team that will as quickly as possible get to the root of the problem and will make changes to the card/ deck as quick as possible, (i mean like really really fast.)\n\nThis in the end has made an incredibly fun, strategic and balanced yet competitve ccg that any card game lover would be insane to miss out on. 10/10\n\n((BONUS: The community is awesome and helpful, if your trying the game for the first time and have questions you should go to the spellweaver forums and say hi! I've yet to come across a single ♥♥♥♥♥♥ there.))\n\n","February 12","true","211.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

I haven't had so much fun creating decks and challening players since the early years of Magic The Gathering. I currently have 8 pages worth of decks based around different ideas and synergies and it is only going to increase with the expansions!\n\nThe Artwork is amazing and really pulls you in. The mechanics are innovative yet familiar, drawing the best features from games like Hearthstone and MTG yet improving upon them and making them distinct and original.\n\nThere are top players from MMDoC and M:TG who play this game and it is great getting to see them on the leaderboards.\n\nThe quest and rewards system is VERY generous for a FTP, if you are an average player you can expect to build some very competitive decks within a few days of simple questing. If you are very skilled you can play Trials and probably get a full set in 3 months. Compare that to Hearthstone where it could take you over a year! While an amazing FTP game, I encourage everyone to take advantage of the 40% bonus crystals for the Steam release.\n\nBut perhaps the best part of this game is the Dev team; a small group of independant developers that really listen to the community and seem to constantly be working on and improving elements of the game based on player feedback. Their creativity is novel and exciting; just when you think a card is going to be fixed or nerfed in a predictable way, they surprise you with their innovative thinking.\n\nBelieve me, after playing Spellweaver with it's Divine Offering mechanic, skill shrine abilities, hero powers and creature Speed mechanic, it is very difficult to go back to playing other CCGs. They have done the seeming impossible by minimizing RNG while maximizing deck variance. Definitely recommend playing this game if you are even slightly interested in CCGs (and even if you are not!)","February 16","true","70.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Isn't that already enough to satisfy your soul?\n\nSpellweaver is a card game that involves a lot of strategy, building a well balanced deck & a little bit of luck when it's your turn to draw cards. Oh yes.... playing against a crappy online opponent is a good thing as well!  Unless you're more into playing against the AI with 3 levels of difficulty, then that is an option as well.\n\nThe game does have its complexities but makes up for it with lots of rewards including a lot of gold coins to help you improve your deck quickly. It also has a nice long learning curve but once you get the hang of it you're ready to spill some opponent blood.\n\nThere is a small cost though. If you want to compete with some of the best online players you'll have to invest in card packs that will give you a chance to unpack 'Rare' or even 'Epic' cards that, when mixed into a strong  multi classed deck, may help you stay on top of the Champion's table amongst some the best players in the world .\n\nOverall, I think this strategic card game can be very entertaining & a blast to play with friends & strangers alike.

That said, I really like Spellweaver. There are issues with it, which I'll point out, but the game is still great.\n\n\nShould You Play This?\n\nYes.  Even if you don't like card games, Spellweaver is a good thing to at least try out, seeing as it both free and is a good blend of the best aspects of other card games.\n\nThe Basics\n\nSpellweaver is, as some people have stated, a mix of other traditional card games. Unlike a lot of other games, there is a unique "speed" aspect to each creature. What this does, is determine if a certain monster can attack another one, or block another. This might not seem like a lot, but it goes a long way for both making the game special, and adding tactics to the game.\n\nBesides the speed though, the game doesn't  really  add in anything too new, which means it'll generally be the same type of card game that people have played before, which isn't a bad or good thing on it's own.\n\nOn the subject of good and bad things, what  is  the good and bad of the game?\n\nThe Good\n\n\nTL:DR - The game has six factions, each with their own playstyle and pros and cons, and different builds. The cards for each deck are also easy to come by, by either the easily gained gold, or the easily finished missions. Finally, the game looks nice, and runs pretty smoothly.\n\nThe game has six factions ( Order, Nature, Wisdom for the 'good' side, and Rage, Dominion, and Corruption making up the 'evil' side ), each with their own specific shrines ( basically, items that allow you to gain more mana for playing spells and creatures, draw cards, and increase your certain 'level', which is used to use certain spells or summon higher leveled creatures ). The different factions also come with their own strengths and weaknesses, which allows a player to figure out what their current deck is good at, and what it's bad at.\n\nStill on the subject of decks, getting new cards for a deck isn't that hard. The marketplace has cheap 'packs' you can use gold for (or crystals, but those are gained strictly through real money or possibly from getting lucky through the ingame quests), or you can get cards through some of the various missions that the game has for you to do.\n\nAnother positive thing that the game has, is the matchmaking system. It's rather quick in the current state, and has pretty much everything you need to really get into the game.\n\nAlong with the matchmaking system, the game's interface is smooth, and looks rather pleasing, so if anything you can rest assured that it doesn't look like crap.\n\n\nNow, we go onto the negative.\n\nThe Bad\n\nTL:DR - The game has a learning curve. It's not huge, but it can take a while to really understand everything about the game, and even then you'll come across somethings you're not used to. The game suffers from some of the most experienced players being matched up with newer players from time to time, which means people are put at an obvious disadvantage. Finally, the game can crash from time to time, and the servers don't like reconnecting you all the time.\n\nWhile there are a lot of good things with the game, it still suffers from some bad stuff.\n\nThe main issue people may have with the game, is the learning curve. There  is  a learning curve with the game, but it isn't enough that it should turn you away from the game. At the start, you'll find it rather strange, with the different spells, creatures, shrines, and all of the effects and such. Once you start to figure out the combat and card aspects, the game gets easier, but for a while, you may be confused.\n\nThis game suffers from really experienced players getting lumped in with newer players. This isn't as bad as it (supposedly) was before, but there still are times when you'll come across a player that has quite obviously played a lot of matches. There really is no sugarcoating this one. It sucks, and it may or may not happen to you.\n\nThis final complaint may actually be on my end, but I'm not sure. The servers seem to be a bit iffy, and you might find yourself crashing from time to time. It's not a big deal, but it gets kinda annoying.\n\nThe Conclusion\n\nSome people may still believe that Spellweaver isn't a game for them, but in reality you really don't know until you try it, and with the price being at zero dollars, you have nothing to lose by trying it out.","February 3","true","28.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

It's rather quick in the current state, and has pretty much everything you need to really get into the game.\n\nAlong with the matchmaking system, the game's interface is smooth, and looks rather pleasing, so if anything you can rest assured that it doesn't look like crap.\n\n\nNow, we go onto the negative.\n\nThe Bad\n\nTL:DR - The game has a learning curve. It's not huge, but it can take a while to really understand everything about the game, and even then you'll come across somethings you're not used to. The game suffers from some of the most experienced players being matched up with newer players from time to time, which means people are put at an obvious disadvantage. Finally, the game can crash from time to time, and the servers don't like reconnecting you all the time.\n\nWhile there are a lot of good things with the game, it still suffers from some bad stuff.\n\nThe main issue people may have with the game, is the learning curve. There  is  a learning curve with the game, but it isn't enough that it should turn you away from the game. At the start, you'll find it rather strange, with the different spells, creatures, shrines, and all of the effects and such. Once you start to figure out the combat and card aspects, the game gets easier, but for a while, you may be confused.\n\nThis game suffers from really experienced players getting lumped in with newer players. This isn't as bad as it (supposedly) was before, but there still are times when you'll come across a player that has quite obviously played a lot of matches. There really is no sugarcoating this one. It sucks, and it may or may not happen to you.\n\nThis final complaint may actually be on my end, but I'm not sure. The servers seem to be a bit iffy, and you might find yourself crashing from time to time. It's not a big deal, but it gets kinda annoying.\n\nThe Conclusion\n\nSome people may still believe that Spellweaver isn't a game for them, but in reality you really don't know until you try it, and with the price being at zero dollars, you have nothing to lose by trying it out.","February 3","true","28.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lanedraex/recommended/429680/","lanedraex","Lanedraex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lanedraex/","106 products in account","The game for me is in a middle ground between Heartstone and MTG.\n\nIt has more depth than HS, with mechanics like Speed (indicates which creatures can attack which, and block) and you do not only have Mana, but also an Order level, so you must balance when to use a Shrine (land-like from MTG) for Mana/Order in a way that allows your strategy to flow.\n\nIt depends a little less in "resources rng" than MTG with a mechanic that allows you to discard a card from your hand for the chance of looking at the top 5 cards of your deck for a Shrine. This adds a forgiving mechanic in case the player is having bad luck and not drawing any Shrines, while also adding another layer of strategy to the game by making you think if it's worth waiting one more turn for the chance of getting a Shrine, or discarding that Spell which is part of your combo so you can block the enemy Creature next turn.\n\nThe other mechanic that I think is worth to say here is that the battlefield has two parts to it, a front-line and a back-line, some creatures start on the front and can attack and defend, but Support and Flying creatures start on the back-row and, in the case of Support, cannot attack or defend (they usually have some special ability) and, in the case of Flying, they can't be targetted, but can attack and defend as if they were front-liners. Creatures can be moved between both lines.\n\nBasics pros and cons (for me) are:\n\nPros:\nGreat free to play model where you can unlock decks just by leveling up (which is pretty quick at the start, every 5 levels), and you can also buy decks with Gold (in-game currency that you get after each match). There is a giveaway right now where you can get 100k for free from MMOBomb (each deck costs about 40k);\nPacks are also cheap to get with Gold;\nThere are daily quests that give you cards, packs, Gold;\nIf you don't find a match in a certain amount of time you can enable an option that allows you to play against AI;\nGame has enough different mechanics to standout from the crowd;\nCards seems balanced;\nYou can mix cards from different Aspects into your deck;\nSimple and easy to use deck building tool with all the filters you'll probably need right now;\nCons:\nThe tutorial is lacking and does not explain the game mechanics very well, if you are a total newbie to card games you will probably get confused;\nThere aren't many cards yet;\nSome starter decks are way more useful than others (unmodified);\nIn short:\nFair business model, many mechanics, less dependent on rng.","February 4","true","76.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kawaiisocks/recommended/429680/","kawaiisocks","KawaiiSocks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kawaiisocks/","99 products in account","Why should one care about this game, when the market of digital CCG is so full. Well, a lot of reasons, to be honest, but for that review we will have a look at what I feel personally makes this game stand out from the "big" competitors.\n\nComparing to Hearthstone:\n\nHearthstone is an amazingly polished product with a surprising amount of depth, but, to be fair, the expectations of depth for HS are really low to begin with. It is extremely reliant on RNG, has tons of absolutely unplayable cards and a very unfriendly free-to-play model, where the daily income is limited.\n\nIt is also extremely limited when it comes to core gameplay, since the class cards cannot be used by any other class, making for a much lower possible combinations count than it is necessary. The latest "format" restriciton only exacerbates this problem and its current state the game is extremely lacking.\n\nSpellweaver, on the other hand, stays true to the MTG roots, but brilliantly improves on the concept of "land cards" as resources. There are mechanics in the game which allow players to dive for lands, while all lands themselves are either cyclable for free or come with a nice ability of their own. Really interesting stuff and an improvement of depth over hearthstone in terms of resource management while an improvement of quality of life over MTG. Spellweaver sits somewhere in the middle and is really enjoayble and mostly frustration-free.\n\nThere is also possibility of reaction on enemy's turn—something I personally feel lacking in HS. Instant spells are not quite as powerful as in MTG and they are truly instant in nature (there is no direct counterplay to spells afaik) and they add to the amount of options available to the player a great deal. Whether #of options=extra depth is still a question, after all im only 12 hours in, but the game is certainly enjoyable.\n\nFinally, even with a rather limited pool of cards the amount of possible deck archetypes is already baffling. It is quite possible to make a semiworking mill, aggro, heavy control and even hexproof strategies seem to be worth exploring. All of this is possible with the ability to build decks with practically any card in it. Amazing and gives a truly MTG feeling.\n\nOkay, with this true MTG feeling in mind the logical question arises—why not just play Hex: Shards of Fate?\n\nI gave the Hex an honest try and it is Hex forums themselves which allowed me to find the hidden gem Spellweaver is. Hex is... clunky, it is atrociously ugly and it has no free-to-play model. Well, there is, but not really.\n\nThe company behind it has tried to create Magic Online and they have succeeded—they did exactly that. Then they added bells and whistles to the original formula which arguably made the game worse and currently try to sell it as their own "product". The worst part is it has failed to be a digital-era CCG we wanted it to be—as deep as magic, but more accessible. It can be considered as deep as MTG (though some of the mechanics in Hex are questionable and very random), but it is certainly not accessible. The friendly (no kappa) in-game community has said that you can farm enough gold for a booster in about 3 hours in the Frost Ring Arena with a good deck. To farm to a good deck it generally takes 30-40 hours of actual grinding in PvE zones and completion of "campaigns" for different heroes... In my book even the HS tutorial is way too long before one can get into PvP action. The amount of time needed to get into actual PvP without spending money is ridiculous. And the game searching takes ages...\n\nSpellweaver has given me a starter deck which was built by a fully functioning CCG player and not some random joe who just picked the pictures he liked better. Spellweaver allowed me to customise said deck as soon as I got extra cards. It has not been holding my hand when I didn't ask it to, but has provided helpful advice. And it allowed me to unlock 4 extra starter decks in the first 12 hours of gameplay, as well as several 10-card boosters. The flow of the first 12 hours ahs been amazing with more and more option opening up and most of them being valid and I am yet to play the "trials".\n\nI am not sure whether Spellweaver will keep on being an excellent game or the Devs will manage to screw the game up as Ubisoft did with MMDoC (amazing CCG killed by Ubi's greed), but as it stands now, the game is worth at least trying.","March 23","true","24.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I thought it was too slow to gain gold, and it would be yet another Pay2Win game.\n\nBut I gave it a chance, and I've come to realize a major difference between this TCG and others - I actually enjoy the gameplay. It's not just another TCG that is about collecting cards and building a deck. You need strategy and tactics in game, and your deck needs to have multiple ways to play to be successful. You don't just sit there collecting cards and hoping you draw your iWin cards in game.\n\nIf you like card games with a lot of strategy and depth, I would definitely recommend it.\n\nAs for my first concern, that gold gain was slow, it does get better. Each starter deck you get (every 5 levels) unlocks a new quest zone which gives regular quests for extra rewards. And as you level, you also unlock more rewarding ways to play. Playing against humans does give much better rewards than playing against AI, however I find the game play vs humans is not bad... Trials game mode ensures everyone has the same chance at drafting a good deck and doing well, and so far in regular PvP I have not encountered any overpowering decks. Strategy, Tactics, and I suppose a little luck is what wins games, not lots of legendary cards.","February 10","true","33.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

With a fair amount of time and effort you can get enough cards to tinker with. The mechanics are solid, a hybrid between Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone. At no point do I feel pressured to play other people. I've amassed a pile of cards and I've only played against another person 3 times. I can relax, play against the AI, and tinker with my decks to my heart's content.\n\nThere are problems though. The factions don't feel balanced. It's a common opinion that dominion and corruption are too strong compared to the other factions. Also, playing friendly matches is painfully slow. Part of the reason I like playing the AI over human opponents is because I don't want to wait at all.  Also, there are occasional server issues. I lose connectivity sometimes and get logged out. Some concepts could be better explained or cleaned up like crafting, but you'll eventually figure it out.\n\nOverall it's fun and engaging.

I am not a Hearthstone fan by any\n\nstretch of the imagination so that might have affected my opinion. If you like MTG+Hearthstone then please do give it a try.\n\n1) Mostly good tutorial but it does not explain order levels very well. Perhaps it was just me but it was not clear when I should be getting 'levels' over mana and cards\n\nwhich can be detrimental to new players if you start out the round wrong.\n\n2) You get to pick a free premade deck and you can get more later on by playing, but you aren't given a chance to try them all out before picking so you can end up with\n\nsomething you are not familiar with and unable to use effectively. An option to try out all the available starter decks before picking would be great as well as a basic\n\ntutorial per premade deck type.\n\n3) The art is too small. Sadly this might be my biggest peeve with the game. The cards are tiny and all I see are rectangles flying up and bumping into each other. I get it\n\nthat they are going for Magic the Gathering style art but this is a computer game and the cards are too small for me to appreciate having them on the table. Cartoony\n\nartstyles with larger images would have been more ideal for me, but that's just my silly opinion.\n\nGood things about it:\n\n1) You can fight the AI instead of just players. Big plus for me. Rewards are smaller but some people don't mind that.\n\n2) You get enough gold to nearly buy another deck when you start and you get free decks as you level up.\n\n3) Initially it appears to be very free-player friendly and the client size is very small (around 300mb) so there is absolutely no harm for you in trying it.\n\n\nAgain, I don't see myself playing this card game, but I can see and appreciate the effort put into it. Just be wary about picking your initial deck. It can be a dealbreaker\n\nif you don't know how to play it. For those of you that like it, please do have fun and I hope this game succeeds.","February 3","true","0.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

There are multiple card rarities, most notably Common, Uncommon, Rare, Extra Rare (as in magic) as well as legendary and epic.  Now obviously whoever gets the most epic cards wins, and it is pay to get lots of super rare cards.  In ranked play, as a new player, I was always egregiously outmatched.  However, the game is solid and solo play is alright.  But unless you invest massive cash and/or time, you won't be able to be competitive.  I can vouch, however, that I got a legendary card out of a regular pack that I earned by playing the game (say you get 1-2 packs an hour just playing the computer by doing quests.)  It's a real shame that in a ranked matched I wasn't facing people of same skill or inexperience or NOOBTARD deck power.  I'm not sure if that's because there was no one to face in the queue or if the ranked match is just that way.  <<Insert your usual "pay to win" complaint here for free game.>>  The tutorial could use some work.  There are several mechanics I see the computer using (who makes plays fast) that I have yet to figure out.  The only real gripe I have is the pay real money mechanic, but hey, it's a free game, so it's really player's choice.  At least there are things to do in here sans competitive play.  Oh, and there are 6 factions.  You pick 1 hero card for deck.  There are 18 hero cards, so I am guessing 2 for each faction and then 6 mixed faction cards, but I am not sure.  One thing is clear is that it will probably be VERY HARD to get the RAREST hero cards.  :(","February 24","true","34.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I've played some quick battle, swiss tournaments, and trials (draft).  From what I have played so far its like a mixture of MTG, Hearthstone, and Heroes of Might and Magic.  The game play is pretty fun.  Can get to where at times there is a lot going on.  For a free to play game it is pretty fun and setup well.  I have played other cards games such as MTG, Hearthstone, Heroes of Might and Magic, Pokemon, and Card Hunter to name a few.  It really isn't a pay to win card game from what I seen.  You can easily farm gold and packs by doing quick battle, trials (if you are good at drafting) and quests they have.  Also, you get rewards for leveling up your account through fame points.

Here i can play draft with ingame money.Starter Deck can totally compete against any other deck. I find myself playing vs stronger "on paper* deck and still winning. More deck (every 5 lvl you unlock one) gets you more quest. These quest can give you anything, from crystal ( real cash ) too gold, epics card and anything basically.\n\nI haven't spend a dime and so far i dont think i really need too. I get lots of free cards just in draft and then you can basically " dissemble? ...Break " cards you dont need into shrine,and then with these shrine you can craft any card you want.

Paying money will only short cut your card collecting, but nothing is in the pay to win box yet, a true free to play in every sense.\n\nStill a bit bugged, for example your currently unable to reliably save custom decks , but it has only just been released and this bug was introduced with the last patch.\n\nOverall, it not something your going to autodelete within 5 mins of playing it, and it has definate potential, for a free game its great.","February 2","true","58.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

If you like Magic and are looking for a Magic-esque game, this is definitely a good option to consider since the actual Steam-released MTG games are pretty terrible. One of the aspects in which Spellweaver shines is the AI mode.

It's still in beta but I expect a lot of it.\n\nIf you are into TCGs you'll be fine with combat (some how like M:TG) and at the same time it'll present new some few mechanics (the support line, atacking directly a creature, and the speed system) wich will impress you. But I'll explain they later.\nIf you're not, I can say it's a easy going game, with intuitive interfaces and an explanation of every creature/spell's abilities/keywords whenever you click it.\n\nAs for now, every card is available through in-game progress. I've read that is not that hard to get all cards for free, but i dont know about future expansions card's quantity/frequency. I've bought some boosters with real money because I'm suportive and as said I think it's a promising game (actually, that's because I'm a lazy anxious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥).\n\nAs for the mechanics:\nI really don't know if there was anything like that before, but it's new to me: the speed system.\nBasically every creature has another status besides Attack and Health, and creatures with given Speed status cant block or attack other with higher ones.\nAnd there's the support line, where creatures can't engage combat (neither be targeted by another atacing one), and to where you can move creatures freely by the cost of the "summon sickness" when returning to front line.\nThose mechanics combined make the combat much more strategic and thought provoking.\n","February 10","true","170.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

It uses a mechanical template more similar to Magic than to Hearthstone, but even then it has made some major mechanical changes, and does not feel like a bad clone.  As a long term cardboard CCG player (primarily the extremely complex and deep Legend of the Five Rings), I'm glad to see a game that isn't emulating Hearthstone (which was too simplistic mechanically for me).\n\nMechanical Differences with Magic:\n\nDual Resource Management - The basic resource generator can either be played to increase your mana or to increase your strength in that school of magic, allowing access to stronger cards.  Knowing when to do which is an important thing to figure out.\n\nResource Cantrip - Basic resources replace themselves which really helps the pacing of the game.\n\nResource Tutoring - There is a built in mechanic to prevent resource screw - you can discard a card to search the top of your deck for a resource.\n\nSpeed Mechanics - An interesting tweak to add other facets to the attack and block matchup.  Units can't block units that are faster than them allowing for some interesting tactical matchups.\n\nSupport Line - Allows interesting non combat abilities to be relatively safe during run of the mill combat, and creates a more interesting flying mechanic than just being unblockable (which is its down rare mechanic).\n\n\nThere are lots of other little differences of course, but many are lexical changes (terms that have been renamed).  All in all, it's a fun game with lots of potential.

A game that is less about playing the optimal hand every turn and more about making tactical decisions that matter?\nSpellweaver might just be that game.\nThere have been many entries in the digital deckbuilding game scene over the past few years, but somehow most of them have managed to take a step in the wrong direction, be it an unreasonable business model, unbalanced gameplay, bad developer support or simply lackluster production values.\nSpellweaver, however, is attempting to tick all the right boxes and is doing a good job so far. It will look immediately familiar to everyone who has played a dueling card game, but has enough unique twists to the classic formula to grab their attention. The rules are easy to comprehend, but there are many strategic layers to be found and a lot of room for experimentation. It's also still very fresh, so new players shouldn't have any trouble amassing a decent collection of cards. The business model is pretty generous in that regard. So if you want to get in on the ground floor, now is the time.\nApart from that, the game has some exciting deckbuilding possibilities. The are six different card factions and, unlike Hearthstone, Spellweaver supports multi-faction decks. The game is currently at the stage where it's really exciting to see where it goes with future card releases. If it manages to develop an interesting and reasonably dynamic meta, this game could really shine among other competitors.\nThe overall presentation is great as well - nothing spectacular, but nicely polished and professional-looking. If there's one complaint I have, it's that the animations can feel too slow and "floaty", which needlessly drags down the pace of an otherwise intense tactical affair.\nAlso, in-game communication is a bit strange: there's a fully functional chat window on the overworld map, but once you're in a match, all means of communication are gone. No chat window, no emotes, nothing. I fully support the idea of minimizing verbal abuse in competitive games, but this doesn't solve the problem and most of the time just feels limiting.\nBut those are minor issues, of course - nothing that should keep you from giving Spellweaver a try.\n\nTL;DR: If you're looking for a quality ccg that's not too convoluted, not too shallow and sports a good business model, this could be it.","March 22","true","15.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You'll need trial/error and a good brain.\n- Some mechanics are implemented in a non-intuitive way, and a few cards are buggy\n- Small card pool, can't wait for expansions. At least this means that it's a good time to get in the game and build your collection.\n- Rare and legendary cards are necessary for many interesting decks, I found grinding with some of the base decks rather boring.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe CCG with the best mechanics. playability and free-to-play model out there, and incidentally a good replacement for the abandoned Duel of Champions. It needs some bugfixing and interface work as well as more cards to reach its true potential, but as it is it's already worth playing.\n\nBONUS\n\n"What other good CCGs should I check out?" I'm glad you asked, those are all on Steam:\n\nFaeria\nInfinity Wars\nHex Shards of Fate\nDuel of Champions (listed for nostalgia reasons, updates have stopped)\nDuelyst (not checked yet, but it has a good reputation)\nCard Hunter","May 18","true","188.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

One of my biggest complaints about MTG and Hex was the fact that you could have a fantastic deck and still lose because you got "mana screwed" every once in awhile. It sucks when it happens and took the fun right out of the game sometimes. Thankfully in Spellweaver they have implemented a new system called "Divine Offering" to mitigate the chances of losing due to lack of resources. This allows each hero to remove a card from their hand  and look at the top 5 cards of their deck. If there is a resource card among them, that player may add it to their hand, it not they get nothing. This effect can only be used once per turn and does not discard the card from the hand so that it can't be abused with stuff that tampers with the graveyard.\n\nNo amount of words can explain how good this game is compared to MTG and Hex, so I suggest you download it and play it for yourself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nayr39/recommended/429680/","Nayr39","Pandemic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nayr39/","74 products in account","Summary:\n\nA nice mix of what is good about Hearthstone and Magic. The main draw for me personally is that it fixes what I dislike most about magic oustide of the massive money investment you need to play Magic. It accelerates acquizition of land cards or in this game, shrines. If you've ever hated not drawing lands Spellweaver has a system in which you can shuffle one card of your choice back into the deck and look at the top 5 cards of your deck, if any are shrines(lands) you can add that to your hand. That and the fact that the shrines are more mulilayered, some giving you new hero powers for example and the fact that you can choose whether you want to increase your mana(which is identical to HS in use but not in how you acquire it) or power level which is a flat resource that never depletes but is required to play certain cards.\n\nSo for me that's huge, I hated having to draw land cards in the f2p versions of Magic and potentially not being able to play anything. This keeps the game fun and fast without the need for cards that ramp up your lands like in Magic.\n\n\nOutside of that, the game is very much like Magic except with the addition of the mechanic I listed and the hero power mechanics, which change the game very drastically. The card art and certain card designs, effects and archetypes are very familiar if you play Magic. But it's unique enough to not feel like a complete copy. There are more complex mechanics like the support line and the speed mechanic and the way in which you block is a bit different than Magic as well. So don't be fooled by it's appearance. There's a lot to enjoy here and a lot of fun unique mechanics to learn.\n\nCONS:\n\nCrafting/Disenchanting\n\nMy main issue with the game right now is the way in which you disenchant cards to craft new ones. You use shrines as currencies, which if you read what I said before are lands. The problem in this game is you need to specifically have shrines for the color in which you are crafting for. And not just that, you need to have at least 20 shrines at all times, so you can't disenchant below that. Why does this matter? Well, at the start you have 0 shrines, you get 20 from the starter decks. So what this means is, you need to either one disenchant a lot of cards of a certain color to first meet the 20 shrine limit before you can even start earning shrines that will go towards disenchanting OR you have to unlock the starter deck for each class which costs 40k gold, which is about 3 packs(it's quite a lot). You can get starter decks by leveling up but it will take a lot of hours to do this. So realistically you'll be spending either a lot of time or potentially money to get enough shrines to make cards you want. Which is nothing new, but the way in which you do it in Spellweaver is very unintuitive. Rather than have a flat rate, it's set up behind this 20 shrine minimum and not just that you have to then transfer shrines from different colors over to the color in which you want to create a card for, but not just that, it taxes you shrines, so the exchange rate isn't even a 1-1 ratio. Imagine in HS if you disenchanted a Hunter card but then had to transfer the dust to Mage first before being able to use it for a Mage card of your choice, but that 100 dust you got from disenchanting got reduced to 80. You'd be ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nArt, UI and Game Options\n\nSo if you've taken a second to look at the gameplay, you'll notice right off the bat that this game does not have the most unique appearance. It's card art looks very similar to Magic, it's main menu while efficient in what it does is bland. Even the name isn't interesting. It comes off too much like a Magic clone, and that will hurt it imo. It could really use a rehaul in a lot of areas to help give it it's own unique style that it really needs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nayr39/recommended/429680/","Nayr39","Pandemic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nayr39/","74 products in account","Summary:\n\nA nice mix of what is good about Hearthstone and Magic. The main draw for me personally is that it fixes what I dislike most about magic oustide of the massive money investment you need to play Magic. It accelerates acquizition of land cards or in this game, shrines. If you've ever hated not drawing lands Spellweaver has a system in which you can shuffle one card of your choice back into the deck and look at the top 5 cards of your deck, if any are shrines(lands) you can add that to your hand. That and the fact that the shrines are more mulilayered, some giving you new hero powers for example and the fact that you can choose whether you want to increase your mana(which is identical to HS in use but not in how you acquire it) or power level which is a flat resource that never depletes but is required to play certain cards.\n\nSo for me that's huge, I hated having to draw land cards in the f2p versions of Magic and potentially not being able to play anything. This keeps the game fun and fast without the need for cards that ramp up your lands like in Magic.\n\n\nOutside of that, the game is very much like Magic except with the addition of the mechanic I listed and the hero power mechanics, which change the game very drastically. The card art and certain card designs, effects and archetypes are very familiar if you play Magic. But it's unique enough to not feel like a complete copy. There are more complex mechanics like the support line and the speed mechanic and the way in which you block is a bit different than Magic as well. So don't be fooled by it's appearance. There's a lot to enjoy here and a lot of fun unique mechanics to learn.\n\nCONS:\n\nCrafting/Disenchanting\n\nMy main issue with the game right now is the way in which you disenchant cards to craft new ones. You use shrines as currencies, which if you read what I said before are lands. The problem in this game is you need to specifically have shrines for the color in which you are crafting for. And not just that, you need to have at least 20 shrines at all times, so you can't disenchant below that. Why does this matter? Well, at the start you have 0 shrines, you get 20 from the starter decks. So what this means is, you need to either one disenchant a lot of cards of a certain color to first meet the 20 shrine limit before you can even start earning shrines that will go towards disenchanting OR you have to unlock the starter deck for each class which costs 40k gold, which is about 3 packs(it's quite a lot). You can get starter decks by leveling up but it will take a lot of hours to do this. So realistically you'll be spending either a lot of time or potentially money to get enough shrines to make cards you want. Which is nothing new, but the way in which you do it in Spellweaver is very unintuitive. Rather than have a flat rate, it's set up behind this 20 shrine minimum and not just that you have to then transfer shrines from different colors over to the color in which you want to create a card for, but not just that, it taxes you shrines, so the exchange rate isn't even a 1-1 ratio. Imagine in HS if you disenchanted a Hunter card but then had to transfer the dust to Mage first before being able to use it for a Mage card of your choice, but that 100 dust you got from disenchanting got reduced to 80. You'd be ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nArt, UI and Game Options\n\nSo if you've taken a second to look at the gameplay, you'll notice right off the bat that this game does not have the most unique appearance. It's card art looks very similar to Magic, it's main menu while efficient in what it does is bland. Even the name isn't interesting. It comes off too much like a Magic clone, and that will hurt it imo. It could really use a rehaul in a lot of areas to help give it it's own unique style that it really needs. The game options however are bare bones, the game is locked at 30 fps and while there is a windowed mode, you cannot adjust the resolution of it, so you'll be stuck with an awkward and ugly game window if you choose to go that route while playing. The 30 fps isn't too bad, you'll get used to it but if you go from other TCGs that run higher you might be annoyed by it.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOverall though, it's a very good game. Fixes thing you might dislike from other TCGs and innovates with it's own twists. The areas in which it lacks while very important can be adjusted and overcome. The core gameplay is great and fills a solid niche between Magic and Hearthstone.","March 24","true","12.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

The artwork and overall flavour are also strong points.\n\nThe actual mechanics take some of the core concepts of other games and add a few unqiue elements; the speed aspect of differant cards adds an interesting additional component to game decisions for example. The devs seem very eager to test new ideas and make changes based on feedback so this is also a big plus.\n\nIn terms of price which is often a real issue with games like this, spellweaver offers a really gentle entry level for most players. I was able to unlock 4 starters and get a good number of booster packs just by playing and learning the basics for free. After this the starter pack is a good first purchase if you like the game; between that and the extra boosters you get by playing and earning gold, for about £15 you will have enough cards to make a decent deck and start playing other people. £15 is a pretty low cost for so much entertainment so it is hard to fault the payment model as it stands. How much you spend therefore is up to you. You can probably do well at the game with what this gets you if you get the mechanics down and practice but to top the leader boards I would imagine you would have to fully optimize your deck and as with any game like this that could get expensive; for the average player a few purchases here and there will keep the game fun enough I suspect.\n\nApart from the points mentioned it is worth noting also that as this is a new game, those joining have the unique chance to watch the game develop from its first set as they themselves get better at the game which itself is an exciting prospect.\n\nRecommended!","March 15","true","70.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Unlike some shady card games that you may pay for content and they take that content and make it redundant in a play mode you might like or rent systems which are just money making schemes. SpellWeaver has none of that and it is nice knowing that they aren’t just after my money like the others, which actually makes them more deserving of money.\n\n- Numerous Diverse quests with satisfying rewards from new card packs and in game currency (gold) to help you develop your card collection to pve quests that reward you for beating particular ai content adding to the gameplay diversity.\n\n-Ability to play friends and get xp from those matches, other card games don't allow rewards for matches between friends, and this gives Spellweaver the upper hand, as people like to play their friends for fun and not feel like they shouldn't because they wouldn't be rewarded for it.\n\n- three different levels of difficulty vs the ai so you can play at your level, this is huge.\n\n-because of the ai flexibility and reward, you aren't forced into pvp against people who may have bigger card collections than you. This takes out the huge issue of matchmaking problems of other card games and is a huge upside in Spellweaver, when you are ready to compete with people then you can, but you aren't forced to as the only way to progress in the game.\n\n-the game does not punish you for not doing daily quests, because you can simply play the ai at your own pace and level and when you have time to play, so you never feel like you fall behind like in other card games where you are forced into pvp and you aren't competitive unless you have all the cards. There is no feeling of pay to win in Spellweaver or pay to play\n\n-No restricting limit on how many pre made decks you want to have, this is massive complaint in other card games, where their developers refuse to increase the deck slots, that is simply not an issue in Spellweaver, you have plenty of deck slots and never worry about it. Absolute pleasure.\n\n-There are tournaments and events for the more competitive spirited, but the casual scene is just so good and relaxing, you just don't have any pressure to play every day, you can enjoy Spellweaver in your own time, this is massive for people with busy lives. But if you want to compete at a high level that is there for you too, with rewards for people who take it to the next level.\n\n-Spectate feature, so you can watch your friends or your favorite tournament matches if you enjoy that.\n\n- Really friendly to new players, because they can play with the ai to begin with they aren't forced to play against people with deep collections, so new players can progress much easier in the game without the feeling that they are being smashed by people with bigger card collections. This choice is a massive pro for new players coming into the game.\n\n- The card collecting is fun and when you get a card you don't have with a fun mechanic you get very excited to create a new deck around it to feature that new mechanic and play with it. Such as Dreyla, what an amazing card before they nerf killed it, now it is a very boring card with same powers as other cards, very repetitive and unoriginal like it was pre nerf. Hopefully they fix it.\n\n- The cashless transaction ratios in game are much friendlier than other card games, so you can sell multiple copies of cards at better ratios so you don’t feel so ripped off when you sell cards back that you don’t need if you have extra copies, and that allows you to get new cards easier. And because you eventually get many copies you can earn new cards at a better rate.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Very Nazi like Community, how do i clarify this? Well let's say you have some contructive comments to add to their community, they will attack you instead of taking your comments in an intelligent and constructive manner. I have seen this ruin other games and i am concerned over this culture in this game. They block and smash peoples opinions who do not conform to their own line of thinking and the developers happily encourage this.\n\n- Some of the changes they make to cards are completely over the top and it splits the community, most times the changes are warranted for balance such as stat balances which are ok, but at times the changes are simply to satisfy their buddies in the community who happen to hate a card that is not over powered at all and does not dominate or ruin the game, the designers will bend at the will of players who are entrenched at the highest level of the community and common sense is thrown out the window. An example of this is breaking a card mechanic simply to satisfy these members. No attempt is made to make the card balanced they simply kill it, even though it was not over powered in the first place, but simply it was a nuisance to some players and they hated the card. Which is crazy because many members like the card, and the card is not a dominant card in high level of play or at any level since it is too slow.\n\n- Aggro and Rush decks dominate Spellweaver\n\n- Do not get too attached to a really cool card with a really cool mechanic, chances are they will break the card so it is unrecognizable and completely break their own policy of not banning cards, by simply nerfing them into oblivion. They could adjust stats for balance but they will instead destroy some amazing fun card mechanics for no good reason.\n\n- Their forum is not an open discussion as they like people to think, they are actually very closed minded and will only listen if you agree with them and make suggestions that supports what they want to do anyway. If you make any suggestions that actually addresses their concerns and would actually help solve their problems, they will shut it down. Really makes it hard to participate in their forums discussions outside of being compliant. So big thumbs down.\n\n-The community is very opinionated and many of the you tubers are like this, it is like they are in Nazi Germany trying to sell you propaganda and completely missing the opportunity to provide an informative service. I do not understand how or why the community is like this. But it really makes it hard for people like me to respect them.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nSpellWeaver is the most pure collectible card game out there, it is fun, simple yet requires intelligence to play and will make you think strategically with less emphasis on luck than other card games out there, very good decision making mechanics unravel as you play the game.\nIf you have played other card games or play other card games and are ready to move on to something more liberating than SpellWeaver could do that for you as it has for me.","March 11","true","241.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I played the beta for about a year. It's an actual card game like Magic or YuGiOh and not a strategy game with a card gimmick like (and I'm not talking ♥♥♥♥ about these games, I actually like them. I just don't think they're card games) BattleForge, Card Hunter, Duelyst and most "card" games that come out nowadays.\n\nThe developers sometimes listen to their players too often and they often mess something up when updating, but the poor fellows have heart and willingness to fix things so I'll forgive them for that. It's very off-putting when a developer makes poor excuses but fortunately the lead developer of this game doesn't do that. Basically, if you like card games I think you have to give this a try and if you're not a particular fan of card games, ♥♥♥♥, give it a try anyway. It only costs you free time. You never know when you'll like something you haven't played yet.\n\nAnd I'm glad they removed the non-sensical "TCG" from their title.","February 1","true","192.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirrabies/recommended/429680/","sirrabies","= SirRabies =","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirrabies/","56 products in account","TL;DR - Spellweaver is the perfect balance of M:TG and Hearthstone, providing the player with an enriching experience that will entertain you immensely, as well as serving as a way to get new players into TCGs.\n\n====================================================================================\n\nSpellweaver - The Rabies Review\nplease don't kill me\n\nEver felt like Magic was too complicated and slow-pased?\nHave you considered Hearthstone too fast and simple?\n\nWell, allow me to introduce you to a VERY fine-looking line between the two known as Spellweaver! A fresh, brand-new, stylized TCG experience available to you right from Steam!\n\nI get nervous sometimes when I feel like I'm writing a review that's too positive. But in all honesty, and yes - I mean ALL honesty - I cannot seem to find much wrong with Spellweaver. Before you jump into this game, let me try and clear up any doubts you may have.\n\nFirst off, you may have been continuously seeing people call this game "the child of M:TG and Hearthstone". This may put a few people off, as it sounds too good to be true. But it's not a lie! Spellweaver has the mana (or whatever it's called) system from Hearthstone, as well as utilizing Hearthstone's likable card-purchasing system that's been adored by it's fans. Spellweaver also comes with just enough of Magic's depth, not too much or too little, to keep you interested. Each card is unique and ravishing, while also coming with a set of abilities that will intrigue you, to say the least. Remember how Magic made it's cards stand out with those clever and/or amusing descriptions, just like what Hearthstone did with those card-entry voices? Spellweaver has those too, in the way M:TG used it.\n\nSecondly, you may be thinking, "Oh my! This game only has Mostly Positive reviews? If I know a thing or three about Steam, this game must be garbage at most!". That, like everything, is a simple opinion bias. Things change, video games and TCGs included. If there was something that the negative reviews said that I agreed with, I would've told you by now. And also, why decide to not buy a FREE game just because of it's reviews, if it still interests you? You lose nothing.\n\nNow, let's just assume that you haven't played Hearthstone nor Magic, and that you're just on the prowl looking for a TCG to try out and/or get into. Then Spellweaver is the perfect place to start out! Don't even spit in the direction of Magic Duels, as it's only a way for the company to get you into the IRL trading card game. Spellweaver is it's own game, made by it's own people. Although, if you haven't tried Hearthstone yet, which is a FREE game, I think you should give it a try!\n\n-- FINAL VERDICT --\n\nGameplay - 8.5/10\nStyle - 8/10\nCard Distributation (how many different cards you'll see while playing) - Not sure; I'll compare it to the M:TG games.\nOriginality - 9/10\nBest Reason to Buy - (For TCG players): A new, refreshing TCG experience. (For new guys): A way to join the TCG world.\n\n====================================================================================\n\n/ - This is usually where Steam reviewers will leave some sort of (sometimes cringey) advertisement to go read all of their reviews. Uhh...instead, I'll just put this here: \(o3o)/ Enjoy! - \","April 12","true","8.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This is a great surprise! I´ve played many card games already and Spellweaver is really growing up on me. Even I would dare to say that this game has much more potential than Magic Duels. Let´s see what this game offers:\n\n- Fully flexible deck editor to create your deck as you want. I even made a 6 color deck, just saying... But there´s more. Heroes which belong to a specific faction can use any hero skills regardless the color. So you can imagine the possibilities...\n\n- 6 factions.\n\n- New mechanic to deal with. Speed.\n\n-Trials which is a draft mode. Very interesting. Other games do not have this  like Magic Duels "Cough" "Cough"\n\n- Initial card pool at the moment is limited but decent. However more cards will be added soon.\n\n- 8 languages will be added too. Incluido Español chavales xD!! Asi que no hay excusa para no jugar.\n\n- A very damm generous quest system. The rewards upon completing quests go from gold, to certain cards or who knows: boosters, crystals, epic cards. Just wow... Truly Amazing. Plus an academy feature that grants epic quests each 3 days.\n\n- Crafting system. If you get repeated cards. Turn them into shrines. Stack those to craft for instance a hero card or any other epic one\n\n- An effective leaderboard in which you keep ascending to get better prizes.\n\nCons?... Are there cons in this game??? I haven´t see anything important really... But I suppose a game could keep improving so maybe I would say:\n\n- Lacks some beautiful osts to enjoy the game ven more. MDOTP 2013 did greatly. Granted I admit it xd. I suppose Spellweaver could enhance this aspect later on.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Hell yes!! I´ve been playing digital versions of Magic and I always hoped they could make a really good version fusing the good things in each one to deliver a good gaming experience. Did they? No they didn´t. Hearhstone? Its a good way to empty your wallet... So I began to wonder if a mix of Magic and Hearhstone could even exist. I don´t know if this is a miracle or what but yes a group people did it!! And it´s called Spellweaver! My dream come true! Thanks a lot devs <3 I love this game xD\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Play already!! Free to download!!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdited and unistalled:\n\nI suppose everything in this life has a catch. And unfortunately, I found it... Now don´t get the wrong idea. The game is ok. And if you can allow the following 2 things... Sure go for it.\n\nA) Yesterday I couldn´t longer resist the temptation. I wasn´t able to save more money and I burned all of it in boosters. How much? Near 350k gold. This is a total of 16 boosters more or less. Results? Only 1 epic, the rest garbage. Awesome... Now imagine someone had invested 350k gold using real money. Do you get where I am getting at? So, point A: annoying & unfair RNG when oppening boosters. Was expecting better cards? Absolutely! What the hell...! If there were boosters with a 75k price ensuring  like 3 random epic cards... I could reconsider. But that´s no the case. Why they offer you such "generous" rewards in quests? Exactly for that. You could spent 1.000.000.000.000 gold in boosters and get only repeated cards all the time. Even if I can use the Shrines... it´s not going to work with me... At least Magic Duels (even if its crappy) allows me to know that by some time I will have the collection unlocked.\n\nB) The AI is a complete joke. When you play against hard AI you might encounter 3 different ones... One of them is the fair one, is challenging, sometimes you win and sometimes you don´t. Another one is an AI that stands still for no reason. So you actually manage to get an "empty win". And finally you can encounter an AI that even if the game is clear and can win it won´t. Instead it will torture you killing all your creatures until you have no more cards in deck.\n\nConclussion if you can ignore these 2 details... Sure play Spellweaver. I still recommend it beacuse... I suppose it was good while it lasted :(\n\nSigh...","March 4","true","33.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

SpellWeaver is generous with gold too so it feels more like being rewarded for playing than grinding. Speaking of gold rewards there's a 100,000 gold code from mmobomb to get you started. It's not without problems though. Some random disconnects and faction balance issues both of which are being addressed.

It's got a great blend of mechanics that make it a really deep, rich game with lots of possible strategies. The speed mechanic especially brings a lot of depth to the gameplay, and it keeps big monsters in check. The resource system (levels and mana) takes a bit of getting used to, but the unique way they handle playing resources, as well as a mechanic that helps you "fish" for a needed mana, helps keep down the likelihood of not having any resources with which to play your cards.\n\nWhile it could be said that you can "pay to win", since as with any TCG you can just plonk down a bunch of money for a bunch of packs and get a lot of rares, there's no cards that you have to pay real money for, and a simple quest system (as well as ample rewards from playing games, especially Friendly and Ranked) means that you can easily earn plenty of packs. The level-up system also unlocks rewards, sometimes large lump sums of gold, and other times a free starter deck  (which can also be bought for 40k gold, or real money if you prefer). For an example, I recently won a Ranked Game which took about 20 minutes, and earned 2,000 gold, with the other player earning half that. 2000 gold is about 1/6th the price of a normal booster pack, though you can spend more to get a pack with better odds of getting certain types of cards. Again, all of this can be paid for with in-game gold. There are cosmetic things (card backs, mostly), but everything else can be bought with gold, or crafted using the in-game crafting system.\n\nThere are also weekly tournaments, as well as other events going on pretty frequently. We don't have a constant global community chat, yet, though hopefully the devs will put one in soon. We do have a chat during the Sunday Funday tourneys, though, so you should come say hi!","March 22","true","44.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I understand that this is a card game, and as such those who pay will obviously have access to more and different cards. However, I don't think this means that packs should be Incredibly unaccessible, even the small packs.\n\nSecondly, I have yet to see a deck of only commons do well (aside from elves, goblin aggro, or dominion implant) against a decently built deck.\n\nLastly, I would take the time to get better and earn most of my cards through the trials, but there is one glaring issue.\nThis is the only game ever to cause my graphics driver to crash, and it does so after 5 minutes of gameplay, without fail.\n\nI definitely feel the game has great potential, especially once they add more cards/expansions, but it has a large barrier between mid-level play and high-level play that is based on cards rather than skill.\n\nThat being said, I will continue to play and watch the game grow.

Shrines double as both mana or color but you can only choose one option per shrine card you play, and you can only play one shrine card per turn.\n\nThe balance in the game is decent. The devs actively nerf or buff cards as necessary for meta diversity. The starter decks are okay. Good enough for AI matches. The factions are not equal as of March 26 2016, so your ease of playing and progress is dependent on picking the correct factions. (Although you can eventually unlock everything.) Getting the first three factions is not too difficult. You start with a deck and get a free one every 5 levels. Getting to level 15 is not too difficult so you should have 4 starter decks within a reasonable amount of time.\n\nOne complaint from new players is the AI quest difficulty, especially for Queen Aleyanna. Do note that a new player isn't expected to be able to immediately beat it. I re-started the game multiple times until I had a very strong opening hand before I beat it.\n\nMechanics such as multi-aspect decks, multi-blocking and the support row are not explained by the game (although maybe the tutorial's been updated since February).

For those of you looking for a methodical, and strategic card game then this is certainly a game you should try.\n\nFor those of you who would like to read on, here are some specific examples.\n\nAnnoying things that are gone:\n- Card collection is much easier than other games, such as Hearthstone, say, because there are quests that give you cards of a certain rarity that you don't already have! Furthermore, if you are willing to spend money on the game you can also get   "premium packs" which, assuming you haven't collected all cards of a particular rarity, give you only cards you havent received already.\n- If you get screwed over by not getting a resource card you need, once per turn you can shuffle one card into your deck in exchange for a resource card off of the top 5 cards in your deck. The other 4 cards you didn't select are shuffled back into your deck\n- No more arbitrary class restriction!! Classes only exist in the sense that you have to invest your resources into one of six aspects in order to play their cards in addition to their mana cost.\n- Turn timers in this game work similar to professional chess games. You have a timer that is only ticking when it is your turn, and you can sit and take 5 minutes to take your turn if you really want to. For those of you concerned about people intentionally taking too much time, there is a warning that pops up on the screen if you take too long and will skip your turn if you don't answer the prompt. Furthermore, the community in this game is usually pretty good about taking only the time that they need to finish their turns.\n\n\nGenerally good things:\n- Very easy to learn, but very difficult to master. You can win the game by healing yourself, killing your opponent, or through exceptional cards that win the game for you based on specific conditions. Furthermore, the addition of a support line, blocking, and exhaustion lead to interesting strategic choices.\n- Good community that is generally respectful! Very few BM finishes.\n- The addition of heroes: For those of you who play Hearthstone there are classes that have hero powers. As an interesting twist in spellweaver, you can use any hero that you want to with any other set of cards; however, in order to use their hero power you have to have the adequete amount of resources. These effects range from the somewhat insignificant to the incredibly powerful in the correct decks. Furthermore, you can empower your hero to gain an addition al 2 powers that have equally powerful effects.","March 29","true","35.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You can almost build a deck with cards provided in the game with your first purchase discount by using this mechanism(at least I did).\nRealizing it's harsh development history I give it a 8 out of 10 for now.

A fresh, brand-new, stylized TCG experience available to you right from Steam!\n\nI get nervous sometimes when I feel like I'm writing a review that's too positive. But in all honesty, and yes - I mean ALL honesty - I cannot seem to find much wrong with Spellweaver. Before you jump into this game, let me try and clear up any doubts you may have.\n\nFirst off, you may have been continuously seeing people call this game "the child of M:TG and Hearthstone". This may put a few people off, as it sounds too good to be true. But it's not a lie! Spellweaver has the mana (or whatever it's called) system from Hearthstone, as well as utilizing Hearthstone's likable card-purchasing system that's been adored by it's fans. Spellweaver also comes with just enough of Magic's depth, not too much or too little, to keep you interested. Each card is unique and ravishing, while also coming with a set of abilities that will intrigue you, to say the least. Remember how Magic made it's cards stand out with those clever and/or amusing descriptions, just like what Hearthstone did with those card-entry voices? Spellweaver has those too, in the way M:TG used it.\n\nSecondly, you may be thinking, "Oh my! This game only has Mostly Positive reviews? If I know a thing or three about Steam, this game must be garbage at most!". That, like everything, is a simple opinion bias. Things change, video games and TCGs included. If there was something that the negative reviews said that I agreed with, I would've told you by now. And also, why decide to not buy a FREE game just because of it's reviews, if it still interests you? You lose nothing.\n\nNow, let's just assume that you haven't played Hearthstone nor Magic, and that you're just on the prowl looking for a TCG to try out and/or get into. Then Spellweaver is the perfect place to start out! Don't even spit in the direction of Magic Duels, as it's only a way for the company to get you into the IRL trading card game. Spellweaver is it's own game, made by it's own people. Although, if you haven't tried Hearthstone yet, which is a FREE game, I think you should give it a try!\n\n-- FINAL VERDICT --\n\nGameplay - 8.5/10\nStyle - 8/10\nCard Distributation (how many different cards you'll see while playing) - Not sure; I'll compare it to the M:TG games.\nOriginality - 9/10\nBest Reason to Buy - (For TCG players): A new, refreshing TCG experience. (For new guys): A way to join the TCG world.\n\n====================================================================================\n\n/ - This is usually where Steam reviewers will leave some sort of (sometimes cringey) advertisement to go read all of their reviews.

Cause of this, i like in depth complex games that requires you to think. Games that will not handfed you anything and where you are free to use your creativity as much as you like.\n\nFor those that are familiar with Magic the Gathering, this will prolly be a pleasent suprise to you. Its much the same, however, as I first stated (and i guess many MtG veterans would kill me for saying it), this game is actually what MtG is missing, and then im thinking about the card game, not the money-pushing wannabe online versions on it.\n\nSpellweaver has it all. Compex and intruiging gameplay packed into a sweet UI and a user friendly, well designed framework. Its free to play, and you can buy premium currency, however this game lets you get gold in descent amounts, so you dont need to do it.\n\nNow, so what are the reasons this is an improvement to MtG.\n\nFIrst of all, Spellweaver introduces mechanics to avoid sitting without mana. It costs, and its a gamble, but it even out the worst of the mana probems that can destroy a good MtG game. The first mechanic is that you can make one mulligan without loosing any cards, but you can only make one. The second is a way to discard one card, look at the top 5 cards, and pick a mana card (shrine) from it.\n\nSecond: Spllweaver has included a second requirement to playing cards. In Spellweaver, all mana is the same colour, however you need levels in each colour to play cards. There are 6 colours here (purple in additon), and each shrine will either provide one permanent mana, or one permanent level (wisdom level).\n\nOther mechanics are the introduction of "speed" to units. Speed is critical to who can block what.Another thing, is the support line. There is to "rows" where your creatures can reside. Front line, and support line. In combination with speed, this makes for so much tactical thinking its almost scary, and i really really really love it.\n\n\nSo.. the downside? Well.. there might be a little too few carsd yet, but the games is new, and the first major expansion is right around the corner.\nThen, there is one color that appears just a little bit too strong compared to the others, but hopefully this will be fixed when more cards come along.\n\n","May 7","true","28.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Quests refresh frequently and give decent rewards. The combat system takes some getting used to, especially with the way some cards alter it, but it can all be practiced in PVE against AIs that scale with your level and also have adjustable difficulty/rewards. Ranked PVP gives generous earnings. Because there are not that many cards in the game yet, it won't take ages to build a deck. Only epics require a lot of grinding. Unlike Hearthstone, there are no cards locked deep into ludicrously overpriced dungeons.

I don't claim to be an amazing player, but I'm not new to this genre either. Duelyst and hearthstone specifically really sucked me in and I have pretty good collections and lots of hours in both of those. I grant that I haven't delved nearly as much into this game or watched high level play like I have the other two. But after getting two of the starting decks (elves and dominion) my conclusion is that this game is just super frustrating to play.\n\nFor one, despite opening what felt like seven million cards the game threw at me, I didn't feel like my collection was growing. Since I only had two of of the factions' starting decks that meant that most of the cards I opened were completely useless. The cards that I had opened in-faction, moreover, weren't very exciting because I either already had them or I needed 2-3 more of them to get them to show up with any consistency.\n\nSecondly, combat seems interesting at first, but gets a lot less fun as time goes on. Minions heal after attacking, like in MTG, but can target other minions specifically, like in heathstone. While speed theoretically restricts which minions can attack which, and you can move minions to the support line to protect them, most minions seem to fall into pretty predictable averages and spawn on the front line. Combine this with a severe lack of board clear and, as a new player, the game can quickly become about getting the big board before your opponent and eternally outvaluing him with slightly bigger or better minions until he dies, which is boring when you're winning and feels terrible when you losing.\n\nIn the end I ended up being more frustrated every time I played the game, even against AI opponents, who were either too easy (presumably because their draws were bad) or too hard (because their draws were better than mine). I never felt like I was making a really smart (or even a really dumb) decision like in Hearthstone or Duelyst. I ended up yelling at the game because it was so annoying. And that's something considering that in Hearthstone isn't free of frustration either.\n\nI'm not saying that this game has no redeeming qualities. The quest system for earning currency is alright. The rate of card acquisition is certainly better than hearthstone. The visual, music, and sound work do the job of making everything pretty (although the constant clanging whenever you enter combat grates on my nerves a bit). But gameplay, man. I had problems with it.","April 15","false","5.8"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","7","16","2","0"

While positive improvements have been introduced, I can't recommend the game because it's still rather simple and lacking the intricate complex strategies of advanced Magic or HEX.  The cards are far too weak to accomodate such a playstyle and so games tend to be very RNG focused as players push for board advantage with their staple faction cards.  I often felt like I couldn't accomplish what I wanted to do and felt frustrated by the limited capacity of deck design.\n\nIf you're looking for grand strategy, this isn't it.

Draft mode is the mode I have most fun playing in TCGs. At first I thought packs would be the entry to drafts in Spellweaver so I hoarded those playing with just the basic decks. Trials does have some issues though. It is more evident when playing Trials that previous experience with games such as MTG can be a bad thing. You do not have the option to respond to what your opponent does in the main phase before the combat. that can be frustrating, but it is not the reason for the thumbs down.\nThe real issue is that some of the factions seem to have an advantage in this game mode. If you can get purple as one of the two factions you have a much greater chance of winning. Purple is beatable, but certainly have the advantage with fast cards and heroes with riddiculous powers. The raven hero in particular is just riddiculously bonkers compared to other heroes. Most people seem to have noticed this too, since I keep seing that one over and over, unfortunately on the wrong side of the gameboard... In constructed formats (Ranked/Friendly/PvE) it seems less of an issue.\nThe game does have potential, and the draft mode is fun. But if you have the option to pick between two different heroes with the same faction combination, and a third with just one new faction it is not much of a choice.\nNow what would make the game mode better? Maybe introducing neutral cards that require no faction level or where the faction level is just unspecified. Maybe the set of cards are balanced for one game mode and not the other? Some cards could be restricted/banned? Maybe a choice of three different faction combos would make things less forced?\nAnyway, thumbs down for balance issues in the Trials/Draft gamemode.","February 28","false","84.4"," 13 of 31 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","13","31","0","4"

No real trading, must buy packs from game or craft (similar to Heartstone). No PvE to speak of except a few boss batles of high difficulty. Gameplay is not very intuitive and the tutorial does not let you play as you wish even if your move would be better and end the match faster. The UI could really use some redesign. The hero portraits take too much space and so do the cards at the bottom, meanwhile the board is too small or we are zoomed too far. A small plus for the moving animation of the board though.\n\nInteresting take on the mana curve, but it seems to heavily favor aggro decks. Not a big fan of the general pricing on packs, although they seem to give gold more generoulsy than Hex or Hearthstone thorugh "trials", but once that's done...\n\nOverall, I think this game is vastly inferior to Hex: Shards of Fate and Hearthstone, but better than the rest of offically launched TCG/CCG. As Faeria and Duelyst release officially soon, Spellweaver will end up way behind in 5th position in my book.\n\nIf I could vote "mixed", I would, but alas I can only choose yay or nay and it's clearly much closer to nay.","May 12","false","0.9"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","2","12","0","0"

The devs really, really, really tried to do something different in TCG's. Unfortunately, they failed horribly. Why? Read on.\n\n1. The biggest culprit is the speed system. Unlike every other game on the planet, your cards can't attack every other card. There are 4 speeds in the game, and each speed can attack their speed rating or lower, never ever higher though. The devs list this as a plus because they counter-balance it by making the heavy hitters slow while the fast units won't do that much damage. Here's the problem. They do a lot of damage, and they're cheaper than the heavy hitters. You also have the usual pump spells to make them do a lot more. So, you're going to gravitate towards the decks that have a bunch of them (Nature, Order, and Vampire/Purple).\n\n2. "But if I survive and get my big creatures down, I'll still win." WRONG! Here's where the speed system really, really falls apart. Say I have 2 4/4 units that are speed 1, and you have 4 speed 2 units. My 2 4/4's can only attack your hero. This means I get to gang up on your unit and kill it once you attack, or I can just put one unit to chump block it. "Well, I'll just wait and block your squishy units and dominate the field." Nope. You can't block any of my units because they're faster. Wait, it gets worse.\n\n3. Okay, I'll just play speed 2 units (what most of the units are btw). Then it comes down to who gets to buff their creatures first AND attacks first. See, if the units are the same speed, the attacker dominates. Why? Well, they get to pick which creature they attack, and unless you have a unit with a higher speed than the attacking unit, you can't switch defenders EVEN IF THEY'RE THE SAME SPEED. So, say you've buffed your units and can eliminate the opponent's units next turn. Ha! You're a turn too late. They attack your guys in the only way you lose everyone instead of wiping them all out. So, you get to watch your troops get slaughtered and can do nothing. Frustrated yet?\n\n4. The Trial system is exactly as horrible as the Arena system in Hearthstone was. You get all the lousy rares/epics to choose from while your three opponents (same 3 loss system) have as close to a constructed deck as possible. Yep, it is just so much fun to see your deck that took 10-15 minutes to build and cost 17.500 gold or a ticket get waxed in 8 turns. Plus, you're required to play 2 colors, and you're randomly assigned them. With a few colors just being way worse than others, you could be screwed from the start, or face someone that got two of the best colors. Ugh.\n\n5. The rarity system needs work. There are just some rares that will never hit the board. Why? They cost too freaking much. One of the best things the devs did is make it that every single time you play a "land" for mana, you draw a card. If you play it for a crystal though, you don't draw a card. That means you want to play only 2 crystals max. Great, let's look at the rares. Oh look, 3 crystals, 3, 3, FOUR, 3, 3, 3, etc. Granted, some of the 3's are very good, but there are only a few colors that have card draw seperate from just playing mana. That also tips some of the decks from good to great and mediocre to bad. If the rares cost like 8 mana and 2 crystals, that would be infinitely better than 5 mana and 3 crystals.\n\n6. This is something that you'd think would be a positive, but it is going to end the game. You don't need to ever spend money on the game. It is truly F2P. The AI in the PvE part are just horrible to the point that you'll win with even the lousy colors. Play on hard, and you get 500 or so gold per fight. Combine that with the free daily quests you get to choose between, and you could get a 10-card pack per day easily without ever facing a human. And you really don't want to.\n\n7. Why? Well, because the beta players will wipe the floor with you. They have all the cards and know the game inside and out. There isn't a huge player base meaning you're more likely to run into them. And if you are starting with one of the lousy colors, you'll get really wiped fast. Certain decks can hold their own if you luck into the right good rares.\n\n8. The card base is way too small right now. You'll have 3-4 of every non-rare/epic by the time you reach level 10. Again, no reason to ever spend money. The game itself gives you almost every rare from just completing the 3 starter quests per color.\n\nAgain, they tried very hard to bring something new to TCG's, but it just didn't work. With it really being F2P, I can't imagine they will have enough capital to keep the servers running for long. They were already having server issues that they had to fix. If you want a TCG that either has no challenge or brutal difficulty that you don't have to spend any money on, this game is for you until the servers go down from no one spending any money. Otherwise, find a different game.\n\nNote: This is someone that beta tested Hearthstone and played MTG for over a decade building all my own decks. I wouldn't call myself an expert at TCG's, but I'm not a novice.","February 11","false","20.1"," 8 of 25 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","8","25","0","0"

The game doesn't even contain anything that resembles decent removal cards, which I guess in their twisted logic is to compensate for the fact how effective removal the minions can be, but all this means is there are even fewer venues for comeback for a player on the back foot.\n\nFurthermore, they even adopted Magic's style of having your scaling resource to play cards with be part of the deck itself, which means that you can fail to draw said resource. This kind of mechanic is fine for a paper card game as it is subject to physical limitations, but there is absolutely no excuse for a stand-alone digital card game working this way. None. Zip. Zero. This said, I realize they implemented an in-game mechanic to have a chance to draw extra "shrines" as they're called, but the fact that they felt compelled to add this arbitrary button to the game speaks volumes of how much of a bad idea the mechanic is.\n\nOh, and as an alternative to actually taking the time to design a decent AI they just give the "PvE" encounters that are supposed to be challenging ridiculous bonuses like starting with extra resources or cards, which like every time this kind of thing is pulled just amounts to playing something other than the actual game itself. It doesn't teach me or help the player in any way or form to transition into playing against real players and is honestly just always lazy game design.\n\nAdd to this that cards, and whole factions, are poorly balanced between each other and just a very poorly designed user interface in general leaves very little to nothing to make this game worth considering.\n\nMy advice is to stay away. Spend your time doing literally anything else.","February 16","false","5.1"," 8 of 29 people (28%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","28","8","29","2","1"

However, I have to say I cannot recommend this game while there are so many egregious bugs.\n\nRandom disconnects\nIf the opposing player takes forever on their turn, the game thinks you are idle and you have to click the "continue playing" button in five seconds or it skips your next action / turn.\nThe "continue playing" button animates when you click it, but the action almost never registers\nIf the opposing player disconnects from the game, you can auto win after three minutes by clicking "stop waiting".  However, you cannot dismiss the dialog, and your play timer continues winding down.  You can play cards from your hand but can't do anything with the cards on the board except click the "all attack" button.  So if your play timer is less than three minutes, and your opponent disconnects, you lose.\nMultiple times in Trial (draft) online matches, without clicking or performing any action, your turn and/or option to block will just be randomly skipped.\nSome card mechanic behaviors are not clearly identified on the card.\n10/10 would hire a quality engineer again","February 5","false","64.6"," 13 of 41 people (32%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","32","13","41","2","3"

There was never that tension that comes from both players being almost out of health and wondering who would draw the card to decide things. That is what makes card games fun to me. The best decks I saw all focused on simply have effects in play that drew out many creatures or stole away the the other hero's creatures. The speed system irritated me to no end and forced me to build my decks just in case I fought an elf deck.

There are either no visiaul indicators or some that are pretty lacking .

It´s something for hardcore TCG/CCG – Gamers, who like to design their deck for months and who are willing to invest all of their leisure time or tons of their money. Progress takes a lot of time in the beginning and therefore the game feels very sluggish. So if you don´t have the time to grind the same quests over and over again, you have to buy expensive packs with real money. Veterans from the Beta always tell how rewarding this game gets later on, but I guess most of the Casuals will not get that far.\n\nThose who are looking for a better “Hearthstone” will be disappointed, because this game is closer to the much more complicated MTG and therefore less accessible than Blizzards counterpart. Instead of a straight gameplay with clear rules you get complicated mechanism, which take very long to see through and to understand.  The Meta also seems to be broken at it´s current state: Only a few decks are dominating and you can forget about the rest......it´s a pitty; maybe the latest changes will solve this issue.\n\nNevertheless the game offers a nice design and a team of developers who are willing to listen to the community and improve the game. So I guess, that the game will be worth another try in a few months, if it still exists.\n\nWhat remains is yet another TCG/CCG without the special thing to distinguish it from the mass.","February 7","false","9.6"," 5 of 26 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","5","26","0","0"

Really the reason I'm negatively reviewing this game is because the number of times the AI (on easy) managed to pull some weird maneuver out of the blue that I had tried just minutes before but couldn't began to be too much. What should be an easy win against an easy opponent was often not so because they simply seemed to have more options available or at least understood how to play each card so they weren't constantly stumped looking at the screen in confusion as to why a certain move is not possible.\nThey need to slow down the opponent moves as well it's pretty easy to get lost in a game with a bunch of unfamiliar cards that all have special stats and conditions so when the computer does a big move you end up just seeing a bunch of flashes on screen as things wiz around and half your units die or the game is just ended. (happened when I had 13 health left, opponent had one creature out and then a bunch of stuff flew around and the match was over, no idea what happened)\nThey also need an undo button, way too easy to click a card to see it's stats and it just gets played to the field and you can't take it back.\n\nNever tried a ranked match because I was able to bug almost all my stats with no effort using cheat engine (gold for days!!!!!) so I assume other people would be cheating in game as well.\n\n(steam isn't showing my play time but it was maybe 10 matches so not much more than a few hours)","February 3","false","0.1"," 6 of 29 people (21%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","21","6","29","2","0"

They can buff their card with implants and buffs multiple times and when they started casting the same damn spell 5 to 6 times in a row, there is something really wrong.\n\n3) If you are kicking their AIs butt it will change from normal to hard or easy to hard. AIs play style changes dramaticly from casual to ultimate survival mode.\n\nNot a well crafted game. Needs more work, a lot more work. Unless you like being bored stupid.\n\n","February 6","false","37.4"," 3 of 24 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","3","24","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmcookiez/recommended/429680/","tmcookiez","<™[-=> Cookiez <=-]™>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmcookiez/","177 products in account","I played this game while it was in open beta and I thought it was quite good. You ought to try it just to see what they have but stay away from the Pay To Win model. I would say that it's still a Magic The Gathering successor/clone as the objective of the game is still to\n1. Knock your opponent down to zero HP\n2. Force him to draw his last card\n\nYou are still going to make the 4 basic types of decks. Aggro, mill, control, and combo.\n\nThanks to Vitaminec. There are are 2 more special objectives which are based on set collection. A Triangelica (White : Control 3 Angels) and Grand Union (Green: Control an Elf, Fairy and Plant) both create an instant win if you play the required cards.\n\nYou also win if you raise your HP from 20 to 40 HP.\n\nPROS\n1. Good Game\nThe cards are fun to play and look at. The mechanics are basically modified MTG.\n\n2. Solving Land Jam\nUnlike Magic the Gathering, every land/mana point you gain lets you draw 1 card. This replenishes the card that you disposed of to build your mana pool.\n\n3. Hero Abilities\nI found this quite unique and refreshing. Every hero you choose has an ability that unlocks upon fulfilling certain prerequisites. You even gain new abilities from your land/shrine cards. Kind of similar to using the heroes in MTG.\n\n4. Easy GUI\nSuper simple and intuitive. Just click and drag your card to your target to attack it.\n\nCONS\n1. Pay To Win\nNo CCG can escape from this model. If you need a rare card to complete that combo, you just to suck it up. Pay and buy that booster. Sure you can do quests to grind gold, but cold hard currency will always triumph.\n\n2. Themes\nSo generic. Undead vampire nobles, elves of the forest, barbarian wastelands, the theme is a copy of any other Tolkienesque/Warcraft themed game. You basically see elves, gnomes, dwarves, angels, vampires, etc. The same creatures in Might and Magic Duel of Champions.","February 2","false","0.3"," 14 of 50 people (28%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","28","14","50","0","50"

The problem? The game is not even a clever or strategic card game. It's about snowballing. You'll know if you lose within the first 2 minutes. Why? Because when a support card that is untouchable and has 15 attack damage after two turns with absurd buffs and your life pool is 20 health,  you'll realize that you are dead, buddy. I'd never recommend this game to anyone. It's about as rigged as the board game "Life." Do yourself a favor and just go play hearthstone. This game is way out of balanced. I like playing games that actually allow people to have fair chances at winning. The sensation you'll get when playing this game can only be described as the feeling one gets when getting into a CTF game on Call of Duty just to find out other team already has you spawn trapped. Determinism should never be implimented into a game. I like my free will. Thanks.

Very nice looking, and easy to learn.\n\nThat being said, the game will cheat like a mother ♥♥♥♥er durring challenges. Even the beginer challenges. The CPU opponent never has a random draw, its always a perfect draw. Unless youve spent a TON of time playing, or spent real cash for more powerful cards, dont bother attempting them.

Unless you plan to spend a LOAD of cash in the game, its not really for the idle casual player. You can not earn enough in game coin to augment your deck playing against the AI. Even if you get some of the quest sites unlocked the time requirements are a bit ... intense. A rare quest is roughly 13 friendly/ranked games. Even if you only play 10 mintue games (closer to 20 are more common) that will still take you over 2 hours for 2 cards. I also got a "mythic" quest. Its 200 for 12 packs. Thats over 30 hours at 10m a round. Its more like a full time job.\n\nSure, youll get cards for doing things you were already going to do, but you will lose consistantly until you do. Its not incentive to play this game.\n\nTo its credit, Ive seen some interesting ways to win, one deck didnt even use creatures.
