Please read the game's rules.\nIt's pretty nice for a free game, offering multiple modes that spice up the gameplay. Apart from classic mode, you can play a variant with disappearing symbols (so that only three last ones are visible) or try your best at ultimate mode, where nine 3x3 games are placed on a large 3x3 grid. It's really fun once you understand the rules, and you start planning five moves ahead to outsmart your opponent.\n\nDespite multiple reviews whining about randomness, there isn't any. The active grid depends on your opponent's previous move - if they placed their symbol at the lower left corner, then your next move is restricted to the lower left grid.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/360870/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","One of the very basic logical games we all learn to play in the early childhood, noughts and crosses, fixed to the state where you need to actually planning your strategy and where crosses not always prevail with their starting advantage.\n\nSpeaking a little more specifically, an "ultimate" Tic-Tac-Toe have 9 squares of usual 9-cells Tic-Tac-Toe playing field, and you gotta use them all, turn by turn. The main catch is that your move predetermines the next move of your opponent. Like if you hit the upper left cell, your opponent have to play on the upper left square... That's longer to tell, than to show, but in the end, we've got our well-known game quite updated, so it is playable again, at least, for some time, until you get the vibe.\n\nWhich is more, there are another new option: draining moves. If you choose this one, in order to win, you have to construct a line of 3 with exactly three hits. If you try to set a trap, and win with 4th step, alas, you 1st hit will be drained from the field, so you have to change your usual moves one more time. It is fun even with the basic single 9-cells field, but when you adding this draining feature to the "ultimate" version, now the game can run for hours, if you and your opponent both skilled enough.\n\nAbove all of it, the game is freemium one. And it is quite easy to get a gold with achievements there.\nI strongly recommend to give it a shot. That's not the only possible variation of Tic-Tac-Toe, and probably not the best (I still like more the one I've played in the schooltime).  But it is a fine little logical game, to catch a breath after working hours, and without killing everything on the screen. Peace, people. Try it on!\nMark 10/10.","December 30, 2015","true","3.1"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","17","23","0","5"

We developed our own culture based off this game, and if you didn't have the skill, you did not belong any where in that town. I went to various tic-tac-toe tournaments across the country, winning all of them. However, the decline in interest in surrounding cities led to the popularity of my hometown to nothing, leaving it in shambles.\n\nUntill this game showed up on Steam.\n\nUltimate Tic-Tac-Toe completely revives the basic tic-tac-toe formula, but adds a new twist, adding layers upon layers of in-depth strats and tricks. This game includes various game modes, that are sure to pique your intrests.\nThose modes include:\nClassic - A classic 3x3 tic-tac-toe exprience\nClassic Forget - The same 3x3 tic-tac-toe, but the oldest 4th game piece is removed, adding more strategies and cognitive thinking.\nUltimate - This is the game's selling mode, and a great reason the pick up the game. In this mode, you have 9 of your basic 3x3 tic-tac-toe boards, in a 3x3 pattern. You have to think of every move you make, and also think one step ahead of your opponent.\nUltimate Forget - This is Classic Forget and Ultimate, merged into one. The oldest 4th game piece is removed from the smaller boards.\nUltimate Forget Total - Probably the most hardcore mode of them all. This mode is like Ultimate Forget, but once you finish a bigger board, those marks can be erased as well! This mode requires lots of thinking and time to outwit your opponent.All of these modes are available against a bot, local multiplayer, multiplayer LAN, and multiplayer over Steam.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is a great masterpiece that expands upon normal tic-tac-toe, and adds a new layer of complexity. This game does not have a very steep learning curve, allowing begginers to enjoy, as well as hardcore gamers, such as myself.\n\nTotal Rating 10/10\nThis game has finally brought my hometown to its former glory, as the tic-tac-toe Champions of the Universe.","August 4, 2015","true","1.3"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","75","15","20","18","3"

I thought I knew Tic-Tac-Toe. Oh god, how wrong I was. When I was greeted with the main menu of this absolute masterpiece, I knew I was in for a treat. The subtle colour differences in the background are reminiscent of rural Moroccan architecture and really added the general theme of the game. I was invited to a game of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe by my co-player, and it was there that we begin to duel, not with swords, but with our minds. Intellect and skill trumped all else, as the game arbitrarily selected squares for us to place our respective symbols in. This battle of wits was both enthralling and mentally challenging, and I was thoroughly exhausted by the whole ordeal. I would, without a doubt, recommend this blockbuster of a game to both friends and family alike.\n\nEDIT: The developer has since responded to my review, and I read the visual guide.

You start with nine "Cells", win a cell and your "X" or "O" takes over that cell, construct a winning line and you win the game, as with normal tic-tac-toe, but to do this you have to win the smaller games, nine smaller games of tic-tac-toe being played *at the same time* against your opponent.\n\nIt's brilliantly simple, and the sting in the tail is the rule, the move you make determines which "cell" the opponent must place their move, and consequently, their move determines which cell you must place YOUR move. Thus the game elevates from simple matters of trying to get three in a row in one given cell to attempting to maneuver your opponent into a position where they are forced to place a symbol in an empty space in such a way that gives you access to a cell that allows you a favorable position, or you might play defensively and play what seems like a nonsensical move, or even throw away a winning line, but in doing so prevent your opponent from gaining a decisive victory.\n\nThis isn't tic-tac-toe anymore. This is chess. It's chess at breakneck speed, it's a strategic knife fight that takes no prisoners, and ramps up in tension, two -good- players can quickly become entangled in multiple complicated dances with several cells on the cusp of victory or defeat and then a game of hopscotch ensues as each player tries to maneuver each other into a position where the opponent is forced into giving ground.\n\nAnd it's free. Emphasis - FREE\n\nFind a friend, someone who likes mind-games, invite them for a game of "ultimate" tic tac toe, get a hot tasty beverage, and prepare to lose an evening as you engage in what will be the most tense evening of strategy that ranks up alongside the very best games of Chaos Reborn and X-COM.\n\n... and it's Tic-Tac-Toe. What has this world come to.\n\nRecommended, may Gaben have mercy upon my soul. I have recommended tic tac toe.","April 30, 2015","true","2.3"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","64","18","28","10","0"

Tic-Tac-Toe could scare you with its noughts and crosses. Pfft. Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe has freaking comic sans. Every battle with a bot is epic, from the first sound of a chalk-board roar, to the glimpse of a cross through the gridline, to the fantastic swoop and crash as the monster lands and draws its cross. The art, animation and sound design for the game is stupendous across the board. At first the noughts look generic, but closer inspection reveals fantastic subtle details in their anatomy. Our favorite aspect, though, is the sound of their chalk-scraping, which also has a secondary sound like a giant flute, providing musical character and power to these mighty beasts.","April 30","true","0.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","6","7","4","0"

Noughts and crosses for those in the UK.\n\nThis rendition is a free indie product, so at least it has that going. The base game's also free if you have pen and paper, so there really wasn't a choice regarding pricing if the developer wanted to stay competitive on the market. I genuinely dig the freeware aesthetic it has going on, sort of like something you'd find on a '100 Games!!' CD that actually cared about itself. I find those collections pretty damn sad, though, so I'm not aware of any that actually do.\n\n\nAs I said earlier, this is tic-tac-toe. If you actually find someone in multiplayer, or invite someone (to find you in matchmaking, of course, since there's no discrete room creation here). you essentially try to make them screw up. If you play against the computer, you set the difficulty to easy if you want any outcome that isn't a stalemate, and even then it's not guaranteed you'll not stalemate.\n\nThere's new variations of the game, which is where things get a little crazy. The titular 'ultimate' mode replaces every square in a standard tic-tac-toe board with its own little board. You try to mark the little boards and win them to make a mark on the big board. The crucial thing here is that you're not actually told that marking the top, middle or bottom of a small board dictates where the next player has to play on the big board. In this case, you actually need a tutorial to play tic-tac-toe, a tutorial that you'll only find in the community guides. It also doesn't help that the variations in small board color that let you know whether you can play there or not seem to be designed to frustrate colorblind people and those who use any sort of screen dimming whatsoever.\n\n'Forget' mode erases the last move made that's four moves old. It's interesting until you realize that it basically means any mark that would let you win is erased so the AI can eventually win instead.\n\n\nThe Steam achievements - for a tic-tac-toe game, I will remind you once again - include ones for various flavors of winstreaks and for reaching 'level 50'. They also don't work in classic mode for some reason, but I digress. The worst thing about this game, really, is that according to the minimum requirements it won't run on Windows XP. That's a bit more flattering: this game is also like something you'd find on a fresh install of XP, except not quite as polished.\n\nDespite the detached, sarcastic tone I affected throughout this review, there's genuine value to be had here. If you know someone, whether a Steam friend or an offline friend you communicate with long-distance, who you'd like to mentally wrestle while you ♥♥♥♥-talk them via Steam (because I'm not sure this game even has a chat feature), this is for you. If you're a masochist who thought chess against Deep Blue's extended family wasn't painful enough, you'll like it too.","March 9","true","0.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","3"

One that, if given enough time, you will find to imprint it's core meaning and values into your personality and, by extention, your entire life. The gameplay is simple enough, but the symbolism presented by the strife between the naughts and crosses, I believe, says something about the human experience and our constant need to achieve perfection and greatness in what we do. The "forget" mode in this game is clearly symbolic of the human fear of death and of being "forgotten", which I think was definitely in the creators mind when they created and perfected that aspect of the game.\n\nI definitely recommend downloading this 'experience', if you will, as it gives one a new outlook on life and presents our strongest desires and hopes in a simplified and enjoyable manner.\n\n"I r8 8/8, no h8, it's gr8 no deb8" -IGN","August 25, 2015","true","88.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","71","5","7","6","22"

But will you want to play this game ?\n\nThis review will be incredibly short as there's not much to talk about here as it's just a tic tac toe game.\n\nThe game has the classic tic tac toe game and it also has a tic tac toe ultimate game mode where you have 9 boards and you try to finish three in  a row to win. There's also a game mode where some of the moves you make get erased to make  it a bit more challenging.\n\nOverall there's really not much to talk about here as it's just a simple and fun Tic Tac Toe game.\n\nThe game is kind of glitchy. When I played it and won a match the game said I lost and erased my victory, but it only happened once.\n\nThe AI is also really smart no matter what difficulty you set it to. It will take you a while to beat the AI because more or less all your games will lead to a draw.\n\nOverall it's a fun game and it's free so if you're bored and have nothing to do, give this game a shot. I give Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe a 7/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","September 27, 2015","true","0.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","3"

What would be nice is some sort of soundtrack going in the background while you play.\n","January 9","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ultimate tic-tac-toe does have a perfect no frills classic mode (i'd recommend lowering the AI if you ever want either side to win)\n\nHowever, I definitely recommend Classic forget mode! This game mode gets as intense as tic-tac-toe can. just when you think you think you've mind ♥♥♥♥ed somebody your oldest move dissapears and you're suddenly the victim.\n\nI think i'll actually keep this game installed for a long time.

While I am aware that these were available on the back of children's menu's at certain kid-friendly restraunts, it being implemented into the digital world was at first rather complicated.  When I first began I instantly sought refuge by approaching it a similar way I did physical copies.  After doing so I received a thumbs up.  This was rather surprising to me, for I had never before got that kind of response when playing the physical version.  So, initially assuming it was implemented to express positive reinforcement, I pressed on.  After a significant amount of rounds I discovered that I was still receiving the same thumbs up that I had when I first started.  Perhaps the game is attempting to create a paradox where no matter what square you choose it will always result in either a positive or negative response.  Perhaps there is no end game.  Then I discovered the 10th square, found in the top right hand corner.  After that the game closed and a feeling of success consumed me.  This 10th square was brilliantly implemented and required the user rid themselves of previous ways of playing in order to beat the game.  In the end I highly recommend this experimental piece of human psycology and how previously held biases influence the players decision making.","April 30, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","3","4","5","0"

With a rating of 9/10 from IGN I can really see the future for a game like this. With repetitive catchy chalk sounds, some dank sound effects and some funky 80's music I really find that I enjoy this game. The AI is great. Easy is great if you want to feel better and Hard if you want to never win a single game, and then consider what your life is worth. I do actually enjoy the new huge deluxe ultimate tic tac toe whatever you've called it. Spent maybe around 5-6 hours just playing that its extremely strategic. I'd probably say more strategic than chess. You really have to plan your moves and think about 17 turns into the future to maximise your winning potential.\n\nOverall, Great game although the one negative is that the game is possibly too hard to first get a grasp of and understand. I'm wishing they would include a tutorial for beginner players as I lost about my first normal 30 games, thinking we were drawing kisses and hugs on a chalkboard (I've learnt from my mistakes now).

Everyone in the world knows how to play Tic-Tac-Toe so why not.\n\nThe A.I. itself has difficulties and because there are only so many possbilities on a Tic-Tac-Toe board, most of the time you'd end up in a tie unless playing on an easier difficulty. The new modes offer something not familiar to most people.\n\nI did have an issue playing the Ultimate mode but realized there are probably rules that I just never learned to figure out before actually playing it. The mode can be fun, but the A.I. is really challenging on hard difficulty.\n\nThe game is fun for casual play, and probably rage inducing at higher level play. Still worth trying out since it's free.\n\nMy short playthrough\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RVUbbHofiw","January 5","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Well done!\n\nPuzzle types I enjoyed\n- "Forget": Where the 4th oldest move on the board each turn disappears.\n- "Ultimate": Each square in the traditional 3x3 board has its own tic-tac-toe. Very fun!\n- "Ultimate Forget": As above, but with the added challenge of the 4th oldest move in each turn disappearing. Really gets your brain thinking!\n\nThe BadNone! Maybe the developer can think of even more different ways to play tic-tac-toe?","January 16","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The same rules of Tic-Tac-Toe still applies. The goal is to make 3 Xs or 3 Os positioned vertically, horizontally or diagonally.  But Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe features more than just that. It offers a new kind of gameplay experience in their different game modes. For starters, it may seem confusing at first but I recommend that you first read the Game Description or check a guide on how to play it.\n\nI really enjoyed this game! The new gameplay refreshes your mind. There's no tutorial but a guide is already provided by the developers for those having problems playing the game. Once you get used to it, it'll be a lot more enjoyable competing with friends through LAN and online.\n\nIf you're looking for a decent casual game to refresh your mind then this game is MUST try for you.\n\nIt's simple. It's classic and yet it's something new!\n\nMy Personal Rating:\nMusic: 5/10 (It would be better if it had a BGM)\nGraphics: 7/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nPlot: n/a (no story plot, it's a casual board game)\n\nOverall: 7/10","April 29, 2015","true","2.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","0"

Traditional reading also consumes huge amounts of physical space on a page or screen, which limits reading effectiveness on small displays. Scrolling, pinching, and resizing a reading area doesn’t fix the problem and only frustrates people. Now, with compact text streaming from Spritz, content can be streamed one word at a time, without forcing your eyes to spend time moving around the page. Spritz makes streaming your content easy and more comfortable, especially on small displays. Our “Redicle” technology enhances readability even more by using horizontal lines and hash marks to direct your eyes to the red letter in each word, so you can focus on the content that interests you.
