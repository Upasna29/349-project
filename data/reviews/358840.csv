"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/358840/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\nZombieRun is an action platformer that has it's problems.\n\nThe screenshots and information shown on the store page for this game initially had me very interested, I haven't seen many platformers take on the theme of Zombies before so was eager to play. As with all other platforming games;  I plugged in my Xbox controller and sat back in my chair to play. Sadly upon loading up, I was faced with my first problem; I was unable to navigate through the main menu with the controller. While this isn't a massive issue, it is the sort of thing I have come to expect from games like this, especially when they are marked as "Full controller" support on their store page.\n\nI navigated through all the menu options as I always do, wanting to check out the controls, this is where I found my second issue. The controller page is just horrendously messy.  I didn't know what actions were referring to which buttons, it was just all over the place. This option may as well be taken out as it stands as it will be no use to anybody, other than a hindrance.\n\nSo I start the game, thinking the controls can't be that hard to figure out as I can always test buttons as soon as I am in the game. NOPE, as soon as you load into the first level, you have to effectively move out of the way of an enemy more or less straight away otherwise you die. While you may not think this is a problem, it is, especially when the controller doesn't work...sadly it is just not me who has the problem, many people online are also complaining of it too. I'm sure you know, playing a platformer game with keyboard is challenging at it's best, but I tried, sadly again the controls were even more of an issue. In order to move around you have to use the arrow keys, and you shoot with your WASD keys, who'd a thought it? This to me is completely backwards.\n\nThe actual game play is very basic too; this may as well call it self a rogue-like too, because you only have one life and if you get hit by a zombie, you go right back to the start; it's brutally hard. I managed to clear a few levels before managing the controls and completing jumping puzzles became too much of an issue.\n\nSo in conclusion, ZombieRun has major controller issues which virtually makes the game unplayable after the first few levels, and even though it's a really cheap game, you'll still feel ripped off if you pick it up and try it.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

So when I saw this game I thought split screen, 4 players, and zombies all the things a game is comprised of to be good.......Wrong!!! So the first thing and the worst thing is the controls we on Xbox controllers it didn't work it says you can configure but it wouldn't so I haven't actually played the game yet. So if you play solo I guess it's a good game but I refuse to do so until they fix this problem maybe the next update.","June 19, 2015","false","0.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

The Developer has poor execution, in my mind. The controls are VERY BAD if you try to use a controller. The keyboard controls are ok at best. It suffers from a lot of Bugs/ Collider issues. The background sprites are slightly off and you can see tears in the background, which are distracting.\n\n\n\n","July 25, 2015","false","0.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unfortunately the game is a bit lacking. It gets rather boring and frustrating fast, especially when you encounter spikes. Their "hitbox" is bigger than the spikes make it look, got me really frustrated on a level. If you hit a spike (or fall off of platforms or hit a zombie) you go to the last checkpoint. There aren't that many of them so most of the time the checkpoint is the beginning of the level. Anyways, below average for sure I'd say.\n\nLil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4VV6m2ReZg","September 28, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At $3.29 Cdn the price is too high for such a simple, aesthetically-limited, slightly-bugged game. It also suffers serious controller issues for a platformer. Add in a lack of any DLC (new characters to play as would have been nice), and gamers will do well to hold onto their Steam change for another title.\n\nRead the full review of this title and more at Budget Gaming Review!\nhttp://budgetgaming.blogspot.ca/2015/06/zombierun.html\n","June 26, 2015","false","2.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","1"

There is no distinct warning for danger, and the controls are a little clunky.  I really wanted this to be  better than it was.  I apologize to the developer for the bad review but  I really can't endorse it.\n\nYou will probably notice that there is no almost no time played on my account for this game but that is just because i played in steam offline mode an a different computer because of the ridiculously absurd fact that you need to download java to run this game.\n\nI gace it like an hour and a half to prove itself worthy but Sorry but this gets a thumbs down.","November 13, 2015","false","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
