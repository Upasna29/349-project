That's what my experience with Hitman GO was like.\n\nI vividly remember playing Hitman: Absolution a few years ago and feeling like the guy from this Youtube clip: $https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31g0YE61PLQ (you'll have to copy and paste the url without the $ at the start because embedded Youtube videos tend to freeze the Steam client). Ok, it wasn't that bad. But while both Hitman: Absolution and Hitman GO are not true Hitman games... the latter's better for it. Unlike Hitman: Absolution, Hitman GO is a solid title that confidently knows what it wants to be and because of this it can stand strong on its own two feet.\n\n\nHitman GO is very much a puzzle game at its core. Each map resembles a typical game board filled with pieces. The player controls the Agent 47 piece and the ultimate objective is to reach the marked destination point (or assassination target on some rare levels) using whatever's placed on the map to your advantage (distraction objects, disguises and so on). The player always starts first and has to make their move. Afterwards, every other piece on the board gets to make their move and then it's back to the player to make their move again. It might sound simple but this turn-based game does get challenging once the player passes the early levels and new enemies start getting introduced.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631897125\n\nSpeaking of levels, there's 15 in each chapter (or game box) and 4 main chapters. A further 2 bonus chapters are supposedly inspired by levels "Curtains Down" and "St. Petersburg Stakeout" which come from games Hitman: Blood Money and Hitman 2: Silent Assassin respectively, and there's yet another bonus chapter called "Airport". So that all adds up to 91 levels (since the Hitman-inspired chapters only have 8 levels each). Truth be told I've only played a little past the first chapter but I'm really enjoying what I have played so far. Each level has a set of 3 objectives, and 2 of them are always different, so it's likely the player will be revisiting each level more than once. On top of that, most players will want to see if they can beat each level again in less moves so the replayability's there.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631897409\n\nThe game doesn't look fancy graphically but that's completely fine because it does its job. It looks just fine on my PC and I'm especially fond of the 3d sets. There's no story but I didn't expect there to be one. The game has a lovely theme that plays on the main menu and level selection screen -- it's calm, soft and appropriate for a thinking game such as this one. There's not much music for the levels themselves (mostly ambient or background noise) but Ave Maria did play on one of the levels and I couldn't help but stop and listen. For those of you who are not familiar with the song, it was the main theme for Hitman: Blood Money. Fantastic choice.\n\nAs for the port itself: it's nothing extraordinary but performance and everything the player would expect out of a game like this is perfectly satisfactory. I could do with a little more options though (since the Options menu is currently very limited and I know some might not like that). Apart from that, the Steam achievements seem to be bugged at the moment (seeing as though I and several people on the game's Community Hub haven't got any achievements whatsoever) and other than the minor facelift this game's received as well as the removal of in-app purchases, there's not much difference between the mobile version and this "Definitive Edition".\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631896498\n\nOverall this is one of those rare mobile games that I can recommend and thus I strongly suggest you consider purchasing. By supporting a good spin-off game like Hitman GO, you'll be sending a message to Square Enix that games like this are what we expect of them and not anything else. I only hope the newest Hitman game will end up being this good. For all of this, I'm giving Hitman GO a 8/10.","February 24","true","17.5"," 138 of 165 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","138","165","6","34"

For me, the controls were well designed and you only need the left mousebutton. The levels are held in a graphically simple diorama style, and it's this simplistic gameplay and graphics that make the game so interesting for me. It is perfect to play for 1-3 hours every now and then.\n\nI got a beta key from the publisher but I tested the final version.\n\nPros:  The music is amazing. Songs like Ave Maria give the song its vibe.\nSimple controls, good pc port and challenging puzzles\nGood price\nSteamcloud &. Steamachievements\nCons:  The graphics\nA workshop would be great\n\nConclusion:\nHitman go is a succeeded variation for every now and then. I don't often play puzzle games, but I truly enjoyed this one with its minimalistic but challenging way. I can only recommend trying it out, since it's also cheap.\n\nTotal rating: 7/10\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","February 27","true","9.7"," 79 of 102 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","79","102","3","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/recommended/427820/","MrWoodenSheep","MrWoodenSheep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/","2273 products in account","Hitman GO is a very simplistic but rewarding game. This is the definitive PC version of a mobile game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDXIeVLmV4g\nI'll start off with the PC port details.\nYou don't have control over advanced graphical options like texture detail or shadows, but I think this game can get away with it considering its simplistic look. It still looks great though! You can change resolution, fullscreen and vsync, and that's about it.\n\nThe PC version has also gotten rid of any microtransactions, and we've been given all DLC bonus levels in this one package.\n\nNow onto the game itself.\nYour goal in every level is to get to the exit. Sometimes, that will require you to kill guards on the way there. Eventually, in certain levels you will need to take out a target.\nThe game is turnbased, so nothing moves until you do. Some guards are stationary, while others will move forward after your move.\n\nThe game does a good job at keeping the experience varied. You get objects to throw and distract guards with, or bushes to hide in, as well as trap doors to "teleport" through. Guard types react differently to eachother, and each chapter has its own location and theme.\n\nEach level gives you what I'm going to call "Hitman Tokens", that you can spend on buying the next chapter. So if you get stuck on the current chapter you're on, you are free to skip to the next one. You may also earn bonus tokens by completing certain challenges within a level. This adds replay value. Sometimes you'll be tasked to complete a level killing no one, killing everyone, grabbing a bonus briefcase, or doing it in a certain amount of moves.\n\nThe game can be quite challenging, but that makes it that much more rewarding.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy the game. It's a cool new way of playing in the Hitman universe, that feels faithful although different enough. My only problem is I haven't figured out a way to move around without swiping. It's not a huge problem, but I would have liked the option to click on the next tile, or use arrows/wasd.\n\nStill, loads of fun and simple enough to get into, but will definitely make you tear your hair out later on. (In a good way)\n","February 23","true","5.7"," 173 of 253 people (68%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","68","173","253","17","6"

Are you kidding me, I can't change the default controls in 2016.\n\nTurn off "auto-camera recenter" Some of the levels can be hard to see because they are complex and start you off at weird angles, for some reason I can "turn the camera" to see the level from a different angle, but if I let go of turn, the camera goes back to the default position, instead of staying where I moved it, this is especially frustrating because which direction "up, down, left, right"  move Agent 47 is dependent on what angle you are viewing him at, this can cause you to move him the wrong direction accidentally due to a camera shift. These are PlayStation 1 tomb-raider/resident evil levels of camera control fail.\n\nNo options in pause menu. You pause the game, and your available selections are "cancel" by which they mean "resume" "restart" which actually does what it says, and "Quit" which actually just returns you to the level select screen. No OPTIONS menu in the pause menu?! Am I taking crazy pills!?\n\nGame has no level creator mode, and is not on steam workshop. Are you kidding me?

I found it very addictive.  This game consists of short little puzzles challenging you to get Agent 47 through levels filled with guards, briefcases to collect, and targets to "kill".  The game plays out like a board game with chess-like pieces.  New pieces (both enemy and support for Agent 47) and new mechanics are slowly introduced over the game's missions.\n\nThis is probably the first mobile game I've really played.  I do have a smart phone and a tablet, but I have virtually never use those for gaming.  I was reluctant to try this game out because of it's mobile roots, but watching a Twitch stream changed my mind.  It seemed like a lot of fun.  I was not disappointed.  I'm glad it came to PC.\n\nThe game is played with the mouse only, swiping Agent 47 to the direction you want him to go.  I would definitely have appreciated a single click option.  There's no keyboard support but I don't think that's a big deal for a game like this.\n\nI do think it's unfortunate that a level editor of some sort wasn't created for this release (as suggested by other reviewers).  It would have been pretty awesome if the community could have built more levels.  The game is a bit short.  It took me about 6 hrs to complete (totally worth the $6 and some change I paid).  I was good enough that I want more.","February 24","true","13.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Its fairly relaxing and adds some features as you proceed like different enemies, covert uniforms, rocks to alter guards paths, bushes to hide in and even a gun to pick off someone you select.  Its fairly basic, but for a tablet to pc for a decent price is worth a few hours of gameplay.\n\nThe game has 7 levels, most have 15 little missions each, except for 1 that has 8. That is approximately 100 total. Some will take several attempts so its likely good for 6-10 hours.\n\nI just beat it, most boards with 2 of 3 stars. Could certainly get many more hours if I wanted to get all 3 stars on each board. The stars vary from collecting the suitcase, killing all enemies, not killing any enemies, not killing dogs or using under so many moves/turns. Some will take repeating a level to get all three stars.\n\n\n+Nice simple graphics\n+Good puzzles that progress\n+Good saving system and challenges that escalate\n+Good appetizer, although completely different than the real Hitman release in a couple of weeks.\n\nWish you got a free copy of this if pre-ordered the main title as I did, since we have to wait throughout the year for a many of the levels to be completed periodically.

Minimalistic, stylish and beautiful. Does a /surprisingly/ good job of capturing that 'essence' of Hitman games: outwitting, outmanuevering, and outgunning (sometimes) your foes. The pieces feel like chess: there isn't much "variety" in the pieces, but they are used with tremendous skill to build puzzles that never feel samey. One of the few games I've ever felt motivated to 100%, with special seals for each level (for beating it in X # of turns, or for beating it without killing anyone, etc.) Some of these were real headscratchers, but despite not being much of a puzzle game player, I never felt the urge to consult a walkthrough. Eventually, through experimentation, you will figure out solutions.\n\nThe art is fantastic. Each level feels like a little artpiece, with figures captured in a variety of poses: people half-spilling coffee, or baggage handlers frozen mid-bag toss. This is really immersive, making you feel like the Hitman: walking consciously and coldly through a world of 'little idiots' unaware and naive to your presence. Just as though the world has stopped moving, while the Hitman stalks his prey.

If you love Hitman Lore, might as well collect this!\n\nMusic and sound effects are amazing!","February 23","true","2.3"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","15","30","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thekillerbits/recommended/427820/","thekillerbits","thekillerbits","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thekillerbits/","784 products in account","So the critically acclaimed Hitman GO gets a long overdue port from mobile platforms to PC and console with this - the Hitman GO: Definitive Edition. (Though the truth is we are probably only getting it now to help build up hype and garner more press coverage ahead of the AAA reboot in a couple of weeks time.)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvRnvQ6T64s\n\nAs ports go it's not a bad one. The game runs really smoothly. And I didn't notice any major bugs or errors or anything like that.\n\nAdmittedly having to actually drag Agent 47 a tile at a time using the mouse feels a little odd at first (as your instinct is to point and click at where you want him to go) but you do get used to it. And as cute as the art style is there are occassionally moments when you can see some of the textures don't really upscale that well from the smaller screen of the iPad to a larger monitor. But these are just minor niggles.\n\nAt the end of the day this is a really satisfying little strategy/puzzle game and definitely worth checking out. And is probably a must buy just as soon as it hits that first Steam sale and gets 40-50% knocked off the price to bring it in line with the iOS and Android versions.","February 23","true","6.6"," 24 of 48 people (50%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","50","24","48","6","0"

Previously on mobile, with fantastic art style, ambient music and absolutely lovely environments inspired by physical board games and dioramas that look even better in higher resolutions, GO is still a game I adore.\n\nIt uses all classic Hitman gameplay mechanics, such as disguises, timing your movement, learning enemy pathings, hiding in plain sight (here with help of a plant), sniper rifles and of course, 47's trusted Silverballers and mixes them up to create an enthralling little title that's both easy to get the hang of and difficult to master. Hey, it's just like the regular Hitman games!\n\nGO starts easy and slowly introduces more gameplay mechanics to the mix, ramping up the difficulty. The game is never too easy or too hard and even though I finished it multiple times on my Android device, I still have trouble with some challenges.\n\nUnfortunatelly, the only problem I had with this game is still present in this version - the challenges are uninspired, usually consisting of picking up the briefcase or finishing the board in a set amount of turns. In most cases, those challenges also cancel each other out (in most cases, you cannot waste turns on the briefcase when you're trying to finish the level fast) therefore, for hitting that 100%, you will have to finish the levels multiple times.\n\nThe boards are never as long for it to become a hassle though and coming up with different strategies for different challenges starts feeling desirable as the game piles up its mechanics.\n\nI never found it frustrating or cheap, the difficulty curve is perfect and I would totally recommend this game for everybody. Not just Hitman fans, but also puzzle game enthusiasts.","February 24","true","5.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

And I've bought some sh*tty games.\n\nSuffice it to say that this is like a board game, you maneuver the Hitman around the board, attacking other pieces from behind or from the side.  When you "attack" a piece, it gets flung off the board like a chess piece.  It was cool like the first time.\n\nI guess there's a kind of caveat emptor that comes into play when purchasing Steam products.  And ultimately it's on me to make sure that I research the game that I am intending to purchase.  I made a poor assumption that this was turn-based in the vein of "Silent Storm", where you could strategically maneuver the Hitman around and perform various actions like you can in the FPS.\n\nIt's nothing like this.  Essentially it's like a big game of "Sorry".  Only "Sorry" is at least fun when you're drunk and you can flick the pieces off the table and p*ss off your friends.  There is some strategy involved, and perhaps I could have tried it a little longer to truly get the feel.  But I was horribly disappointed in this game, it was so much different than billed and expected.\n\nWhat else to talk about?  You have to drag and drop the pieces with the mouse...which is pretty annoying.  My understanding is that it's a port from a mobile app.  But would it have been that hard to make the pieces easier to move?  There are only about four things you can do and moving the pieces is a big part of it.\n\nThe game boasts many "levels".  The first "level" (1-1) involves you maneuvering the Hitman into the city sewer, two drags and you're "done".  You don't even get any decent graphics of the Hitman grappling with a manhole, no cut-scenes of him clambering down.\n\nHonestly, I thought this was a pretty obvious money grab and attempt at squeezing some cash out of established fans.  I got news for you, Square Enix -- the Hitman franchise ain't all that fab any more and hasn't been any good for years.  Maybe try to go back to the original formula -- sneaking around and garroting people.\n\nDon't waste your money.  Or, if you do, then don't blame me.","March 19","false","0.2"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","3","10","2","1"

I had heard of the game, but never actually considered playing it. After watching the trailer and looking at screenshots I had to give it a shot.\n\nHere's the rundown:\nHitman GO basically acts as a virtual board game (I have no idea if it is real but whatevs)\nYou play as Agent 47 and you must strategize to reach the exit of each level without getting spotted. If you're spotted, you start from the beginning. The game is real fun and at some points, it's nerve-rackingly difficult.\nOnce you beat said difficult level, you will feel like you accomplished something or say "man, how did I not figure that out?!"\nIt's one of the most puzzling games I've played but it's so damn good. It has a lot of content for a game that's only $6.39. I'd advise anyone to get it while it's that cheap because it's a very nice game. I personally love it and can't stop playing it.\n\nI rate it 8.5/10","February 27","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have found only three exceptions to this on my phone travels. A FMV game called "Tender Loving Care". A point and click game called "Yesterday". And this game, HITMAN GO.\n\nHitman GO is a minimalist puzzle game take on the complex hitman series.  It prides itself on boiling down all the complexness of bloodmoney into a simple yet challenging puzzle game (Which is better then it sounds trust me) Enough talk lets assasinate some ♥♥♥♥♥es and dive right in to HITMAN GO!\n\nSTORY\nWhile the other Hitman Games had a rich story as the cherry on top of tight gameplay, HITMAN GO has no story and doesnt really need one. Your a hitman. Kill your way to the exit of each level. Sometimes the level exit is replaced with a random guy you need to kill. No Big Deal.\n\nPRESENTATION\nThe graphics arent HYPEREALISTIC 1020P HD However. The minamalist board game style is not only really nice and easy on the eyes but also isnt distracting when you are trying to play. Even though the layout is simple you still feel like your sneaking around a airport or a suburban apartment complex. The game is usualy silent to help you concintrate, but the smoothe sounds of Ave Maria kick in in the levels where you kill your target. Which usualy calms you down from rage quitting.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThere are currently 5 chapters with two half chapters inspired by some of the other Hitman Games. All in All 91 levels with scaling difficulty. When you start out, its very simple. Get to the end of the level, dont get caught, attack gaurds from behind. But more and more gameplay elements get thrown in as you proceed such as everything from guns to gaurds with dogs and tazers. Mixing all these elements in with old things you learn is great at keeping you on your toes and makes for a great puzzle experience. There are also two alternate objectives for each level which requires you to finish the level whilst also doing something, like picking up a breifcase or killing everyone. Making a bit of replay-ability.\n\nFREEMIUM ASPECTS\nIn the mobile version  the only micro transactions were to pay for walkthroughs or "hints" if you got stuck on a level. This was great because it encouraged the player to get better and find the solution themselves. In the steam version, there are no micro transactions at all, so cheat to your hearts content! WARNING IF YOU USE THE INGAME HINTS YOU WILL NOT GET A ACHIEVMENT!\n\nRanking: FULL PRICE BUY\n","March 3","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
