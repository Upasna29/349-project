So I'll just say that it looks like the spike maker counted up the order wrong and ...\n\nOk I have nothing. Luckily Nicalis have something quite special in this platformer from the affectionately named "♥♥♥♥ing troll ♥♥♥ game" genre.\n\nThe gameplay is simple enough (with one oddity, which I will get to). You enter a level, you avoid traps and make some jumps while also shooting knives at the occasional enemy. You find the key and perhaps the hidden mask object and make your way to the exit. You then repeat this process through longer and more difficult stages until you run out of things to do. Along the way expect plenty of water, fire, snakes, scorpions, crushing blocks, spikes and even more spikey spikes. There isn't anything particularly original here if you have played similar games in the past (stretching a long way back) but what is here has been proven to work.\n\nThe controls are a little strange in that you have two jump buttons, one "high" and one "low". This saves you having to judge how hard to press a button (high enough to clear a spike, but low enough to avoid the fire above?) but it can get a bit fiddly at times. Personally I always found myself using the high jump unless a situation specifically seemed to call for it. In these cases, such as jumping on a block without triggering an arrow trap it was handy, but I'm still not sold on the concept. Still, everything works and you can aim your jumps properly and it doesn't feel floaty. If anything, jumping and shooting fails a bit more often than it should, when trying to line up a small object like an arrow (when you are standing shots line up perfectly). This isn't a big deal though, so in this regard the controls get a solid pass.\n\nTo complement the tight controls, the level design is all important in a game like this and 1001 Spikes doesn't let you down. The levels all seem lengthy but not "too long" and there is a good variety in the challenges. For example, one level will have you carefully negotiating spiked passages, waiting for just the right moment to advance forward. The next level will require you to make a series of fast paced jumps as everything falls down around you. Levels feel unique, despite reusing a lot of assets and the effort required to pass them should make them memorable long after.\n\nThat is, if you don't give up on it. The magic of "♥♥♥♥ing troll ♥♥♥ game" is in how much they troll you and how much of it you can take. Think you have finished the level? Well you forgot about that block, right at the end which will drop on your head without warning. This will kill you, forcing you to restart the level (no checkpoints here!) in an increasingly infuriating manner. So where does it sit on the troll meter? Above Super Meat Boy, some obstacles you just can't avoid. But it is also well below something like I want to Be The Boshy. Most traps give you a split second of warning, such as the tips of spikes showing before they impale you. Because of this, most deaths (but not all) feel like they are a result of you not paying close enough attention. The game does a good job of training you too. Chance are if you find a good place to rest while you evaluate the next section of a level? There are spikes on that block.\n\nSo you'll die, but you'll learn and progress always feels achievable (or you can skip levels, so it isn't a big drama). Note that you do technically have a life limit (x1000) but 1ups are easily farmable by redoing short stages and finding the bonus pick up. So 1001 Spikes is tough but just fair enough (think 1-5 deaths on an easy stage, 20-30 on a hard one), which will hopefully not put off too many people.\n\nHaving said that, one of the most difficult challenges the game offers is getting through the story parts without hitting "skip". They are long, stretching on forever and the text forwards far too slowly. I kind of enjoy the ironic tone to the writing, but little of importance is said and there doesn't seem to be any need for a story at all. Rest assured you can safely skip it and get back to the spikes.\n\nTo round out the package, the game offers other arcade style modes which can be played in 4 player local coop (sorry online fans). These include challenges such as climbing a high tower and competitive modes like holding an urn the longest, which remind me strongly of old NES or even C64 titles and other treats like an extra difficult tribute to a past game. Rest assured too that the coins you collect in those modes are not completely going to waste.\n\nNow I'm not a big coop gamer (people who are will love playing through the main game with a friend), so these extras are not necessarily for me, but they do make an easy purchase decision even easier. Further the game provides a wide variety of unlockable characters, each with their own abilities (longer jumps, double jumps etc). This lets you tackles the levels again with different approaches and helps alleviate any concerns about the number of available levels (although there are enough anyway, without spoiling anything, probably a lot more than you think!).\n\nIn terms of presentation, 1001 is more functional than impressive, but everything does the job. The music is suitably excellent and the sound effects inoffensive. If anything the menu systems and cutscenes could use an extra coat of polish, but as mentioned before they are best skipped anyway, so perhaps skimping on them was the best approach after all.\n\nI really like 1001 Spikes. I realise it will not be for everybody, given the brutal style. But it is just accessible enough that everybody should give it a go, just in case they get the right level of sadistic fun out of it.\n\nJust keep an eye out for that 1001'th spike. That'll be the one that gets you or ... yeah still nothing.","June 3, 2014","true","15.9"," 87 of 96 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","87","96","0","0"

This game is by far one of my favorite platformers that I have played right next to super meat boy. This game is as tough as it can get and if you want to make it far you will need to have the psychologic idea of "if it looks like it's able to kill you, it probably will"\n\nNow I will admit this game's degree of difficulty at times goes down to out right troll level, with traps right at the finishing door which will kind of ruin the vibe of completeing the level. I will also say that Some of the golden skulls as well as levels I would of had no idea how to do unless I googled how to finish it or obtain the skull.\n\nOnto some positive notes I personally love the difficulty of this game! I view myself as a veteran; claimably a master when it comes to platforming and and it's nice to see games like this come and basically give you a slap in the face and say "you think you're hot stuff huh? Try this on for size then". It gives us gamers the reality check we need to see that we are not "MLG" or "Greatest Platformer in NA", we are just gamers with more fun to experience with this game and to overcome it through all the hard times and trials it provides. The major positive aside, I also adored how it seemed so retro as I feel it really fit with the style of game, as it was 3D or something, this game would end up looking much worse in my opinion. The music is also divine and the little details really add to the ruins and complete this game. If you are looking for a nice little challenge than please without hesitation pick up this fantastic game. And don't you worry about your extra lives, as you have 1001~","October 26, 2014","true","8.1"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","35","42","7","1"

Your controls and goal are simple and the "easy to learn, hard to master" philosophy is in full effect here. 1001 Spikes avoids one of the big sins of platforming (lack of precision) very well. Your characters have a high and low jump, and some type of attack. The gameplay feels satisfying. With a little trial and error, you will find yourself knocking projectiles out of the sky, dodging pressure sensitive spikes and juggling between high and low jumps. It feels very inutitve traversing the levels and the range and weight of your characters actions begin to feel like second nature. The boss fights are also refreshing.\n\nThe various characters you can unlock (most being cameos) are all very neat and have their own quirks, however you cannot enjoy them interchangeably. It was such a let down for me to unlock a new character after some hard runs only to find out that I have to restart from level 1 with that character rather than being able pick up where I left off. This can give you an opportunity to play around with all your characters and really get to know them, but the game is kind of forcing you to take character tryouts seriously by pushing you back to square one. With that complaint aside, I found trying out all the characters very enjoyable. Curly Braces from Cave Story is probably the easiest to play with her jet booster, but my favorite is President Thompson with his double jump and machine gun.\n\nThe alternate modes (or hint hint, there is a whole separate campaign if you know where to look) are fun and add plenty of replay and longevity. The co-op modes were extremely enjoyable and I was actually able to beat some levels with people who were new or rusty to platformers. Still, I would say playing through one of the co-op campaigns of 1001 Spikes with a friend was one of my favorite serious, short, co-op experiences.\n\nI think some relative comparisons are in order to be more helpful.I enjoyed Super Meat Boy and Spelunky to an extent: I am not a fan of slippery or floaty characters in platformers (SMB) and I found it was way more fun to just kill all my friends in local co-op than actually try to work together and beat Spelunky (I also preferred the original art style).\n\nHowever, I definitely really like all 3 games, so here are some relevant details:SMB has a faster restart than 1001 and unlimited lives (though 1001 offers plenty of lives and you can always go back and earn more), 1001 Spikes has set levels you choose rather than randomized ones that string together like Spelunky, 1001 Spikes has significantly more unlocks than the other 2, 1001 Spikes has set aside co-op campaigns while Spelunky offers some competition and only the main campaign with enabled co-op, 1001 Spikes has some action in the form of shooting, while SMB has none and Spelunky has more depth with in game shop and variance of weapons, The boss levels in 1001 are a good mix of action and platforming, SMB was strictly speed based platforming, Spelunky feels more like a Mario boss fight.\n\n1001 Spikes has a lot of replay value, great controls, and satisfying gameplay. The co-op, large cast of characters, alternate modes and long campaign are equally challenging and fun.\n(I happened to play it without internet last summer, so please ignore the short amount of hours as it is definitely not accurate).","January 25, 2015","true","17.3"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

You simply move through the level, free from danger, and ironically these are the moments in which I truly feel like I am on an adventure.\n\nIt's not that I use this time to reflect on the challenges that I've surmounted.  It's not that transition in which I am saying goodbye to one area with its distinctive tileset before moving on to another.  The romance of these stages is simpler than that: It's just a pleasure to move through an exotic space!  By suddenly stripping away all semblance of difficulty, 1001 Spikes startles you into noticing that one of the basic strengths of videogames is the experience of place.\n\nWhen all of the scorpions and dart-shooting busts and crushing effigies and flamethrowers fall away, there's just you and a decaying ruin, adorned by idols carved from bricks of gold and lit by columns of blue flame, housed within the red dirt of the jungle and deep purple caverns, overgrown with vines that sway as you brush by, curtained by waterfalls and the slowly flooding drip of leaking ceilings, and eroded by lakes of fire barely contained with thick stone dams.  Corridors narrow to a crawlspace and balloon outward into large pedestal chambers.  They wind from side to side, rising and falling, or provide a shambling staircase out of darkness.\n\nThe fundamental lines of these spatial compositions are as beautiful as the pixel art with which they are drawn, and these little journeys are yet further characterized by situational events.  Rope bridges collapse behind you, imposing doors are opened with the depression of multiple switches or the assembly of several ritual keys, and gates crumble away with the terrain, dropping you into the abyss.  These surprises somehow manage to evoke a sense of mystery even though there are no puzzles to solve and a sense of adventure even though your path is a straight line.  I could play an entire game comprised of these completely safe yet intriguing and enchanting stages.\n\nUkampa lies behind me in ruins, its golden skulls all safely ensconced within my loot sack, but I am not finished with 1001 Spikes.  Not by a long sight.  More adventures await.  Regardless, I am more than ready to say that I don't just enjoy this game; I love it.","July 2, 2014","true","18.1"," 36 of 47 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","36","47","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/260790/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","1001 Spikes is a difficult platformer made by Nicalis (Cave Story+, The Binding of Isaac). Father of the protagonist is missing - only thing there's left by him is a map and a letter to seek Ukampa ruins in South America. Challenge accepted.\n\nControls are made pretty tight, you won't have any problems regarding movement or jumping, which are required for hard platformers anyway. Jumping isn't depending on the intensity of your button pushing and is always same height, because you actually have two buttons to jump - you can do a small (1 block up) or a big (2 blocks up) jump. But that isn't something bad, you'll get used to it quickly.\n\nLevel design is nice, all levels are made with emphasis on speedrunning, so they are not long - expect usually about 1 minute per level from start to finish. That doesn't mean you'd need only one minute to beat every level, you'll be dying a lot. There are many traps and passages that just asks for you to die so you know what to avoid next time.\n\nThe game also requires some basic multitasking skills, as there are passages where you have to check spikes around you, and throw daggers at shooting traps meanwhile - you'll have to count the time of trap reset to throw at the right time. Do you still thing that 1001 lives for 1001 Spikes is enough for you?\n\nControls, game menu and overall presentation of the game is polished and worth the price. That includes sweet pixelart graphics and great 8bit soundtrack that won't get old (well, it did, but you'll still like it).\n\nConclusion:This game is a great buy for those who want a 2D platforming challenge. It's not easy, it requires proper training for every level, and is rewarding enough in the end, with the feel of success.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 9","true","0.7"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","3"

(As well as to the NIS platformer, Prinny, a Disgaea spin-off, due to the large amount of lives.) 1001 Spikes does a really good job at it's name, giving you a spike death for each of your 1001 lives! It has a ton of content, either local co-op or single player, and tons of stuff to unlock for fun, like extra characters.\n\nEach level has a collectable Golden Skull to find, usually hidden, at each threshold they have some extra content for those who dare to get collect them which come in the form of extra modes or characters. When you play as one of the unlockable characters, your level progress is seperate from the main hero and each other unlockable character, and the skulls replaced with coins which you can use to unlock even more stuff with in the shop. Each almost every character plays entirely different, even the cosplay ones for the main hero have entirely different playstyles and plenty of little details to them. (The Belmont cameo cosplay removes your ranged option of a throwing knife, to a shorter distanced whip, in an exchange for damage power, stuff like that.)\n\nIt might seem a bit pricey at $15.00 USD, maybe even still at the $10.00 USD discount price, but it's worth it. With all that content, along with the option to try a hand at speedrunning the game with the timer aid, or getting a better time on a certain level, there is a lot to love and your dollar goes a long way.\n\nThe bad side: There are a few bugs, some people are having a little trouble launching the game or getting music to play after death in a level and having to restart, but hopefully they will fix it soon. There are slight workarounds for each bug at the moment, and they aren't making the game cripplingly unplayable.\n\nOverall, if you like the idea of the game, and you are up for a tough challenge, it's worth picking up.

The 1001 in the title is actually refering to the number of lives you start with. (Though it could mean the spikes because there is a damn lot of them).\n\nYou have 1001 lives to best your way through all '30' levels of the Ukampa tomb but don't let that discourage you or make you think that's all the lives you have. At the end of each section, you'll find an artifact which gives you a large chunk of lives. Along with those, there is a skull collectible in each level (including the room that's just a straight walk to the artifact) which I highly recommend collecting. Not only does it grant you a life every time you pick it up (It has to be recollected every time you die) but it also lets you unlock new, fun characters.\n\nThese unlockable characters really encourage replaying the game to see how much better you can do with them, the different ways they can clear the levels with their unique abilities (These characters are also characters from different games which helps to encourage unlocking them just to see who they are. See Super Meat Boy if you wonder what I mean by 'From different games') Lastly these characters also have a different collectible to the skull. In this case, a coin that gives you money from 100 to 1000 and beyond as you get to the later levels which allow you to buy even more lives.\n\nFor the price you're buying, you're definitely getting your money's worth. Not only is there the main game 1001 spikes but there is also side stories that unlock which take Aban to new dangerous adventures and *Bit of a spoiler* After beating the 'boss', a whole new set of levels open up.\n\nIt's definitely worth the buy.\n\nI can understand that the idea of a rage game can turn some people off when they think of games like "I wanna be the guy" or "Eryi's action" on steam but erase those from your mind. This game is definitely designed to lead to a rage at some point depending on your patience, of course but it's not one big trap feast. Like you won't walk through trees just for an apple to shoot down and kill you like in IWBTG. It's not that kind.\n\nYou will stumble into some traps or do something wrong that requires you to kill yourself (Selecting retry in the menu takes a life) but as the game goes on, you will start to spot the signs like in Eryi's action where you can suspect which spots are trapped. Everything in 1001 spikes makes a distinct sound like the click of spikes to help you figure out the timing.\n\nI can definitely recommend this game. If this helps you decide to buy it, then I wish you luck.","July 18, 2015","true","12.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

It will stop at nothing to impale you on spikes, crush you with a boulder, burn you alive, and then impale you on even more spikes. Some may even call this a rage game by how hard it gets, but stepping up to the challenge and completing each level is really satisfying.\n\nHere's a quick look video that goes over the postives and negatives of this game. But for those of you who just wanna read about it, continue below. (Info about other modes below since this only covers story, which is the meat of the game)\n\nhttp://youtu.be/3kUrYLU_9qw\n\nLet me begin my review with what this game is about. You're an adventurer exploring trap-infested dungeons, and the whole reason you're there is because you want to get the treasure to prove to your late father that you're a real man. Yeah, a guy with daddy issues. The reason this is called 1001 spikes is because you get that many lives to complete the game with, but you can get more by collecting artifacts and golden skulls. It's pretty straightforward, but the fun comes with the challenging maps.\n\nIn every level, you need to collect a key, then go to the exit. But it's not as simple as that. Hidden spikes will pop up without warning, dart traps will suddenly fire when you go near, and platforms with fall without warning as soon as you step on them. Because of this, you will die many times and have to start over from the beginning. Yet each time you will become a little wiser and learn the patterns until you eventually reach the end. Very much a trial and error system, but a good one that keep things challenging, but not enough to feel too cheap and make me want to quit.\n\nAnother good thing is the ability to drag your friends in for some local co-op or minigames. Things can get very hectic and fun as you try to complete levels together or kill each other. Every character plays a bit different too, such as playing Knight Arthur from Ghouls 'n Ghosts and having his armor get knocked off after a hit for a second life. There's even an interesting tower-climbing mode with boss battles if you collect golden skulls to unlock it, so don't forget to grab them as you play the story mode. The last mode you get is basically the same as the story, but the levels are hard right off the bat and you only get 100 lives.\n\nHowever, this game isn't without some faults.\n-There isn't any online multiplayer, nor is there any bots. So if you're all by your lonesome, half of the game's selling point doesn't apply to you. Sure you can play the levels by yourself, but it's kinda boring and the levels lose most of their dynamics since they cater to multiple people.\n-Some people may take issue with the pixel graphics and over-saturation of them in today's market. And while I personally don't mind the graphic style, lots of people avoid games simply for this reason alone.\n-Even though I do like the difficulty, sometimes I found myself frustrated with some of the trial and error gameplay. Can't tell you how many times I was so close to the end only to be sent back to the beginning from a hidden spike trap.\n-Honestly, I think this should be a $10 game. I was halfway through the campaign after only one and a half hours, so with it being so short on its single-player mode, it may turn a few people away. Though admittedly, the later levels are gonna take you much longer to complete since they start getting insane.\n\nTo wrap this up, this game is for those who like a challenge. It even caters to those who are perfectionists and want every collectible and the best times. So if you have buds to play with, this is a good buy. But if you only want it for the single player, get it if you've been itching for a game that really pushes you to beat it. And if you're still on the fence, wait for a discount and this will definitely be worth it.","June 3, 2014","true","4.6"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","25","35","0","0"

While the game is very challenging, and often unfair, it still feels incredibly rewarding because you get a little bit further with each attempt. It's twitchy platforming action with a lot of projectiles, and some cruel traps thrown in. That's probably not for everyone, but I like it.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, and I'm very excited to see each new area. It looks and feels like a NES game with some subtle modern touches that wouldn't be possible on a real NES. For example, background vines animate when you walk past them. There's tons of references to classic games like Mario or Ghosts n Goblins, and the cutscenes even have intentional spelling errors!\n\nThere's tons of content and different game modes too. I've still not seen everything, 11 hours in. And then there's replay value on top of that.\n\nHowever, a lot of what makes 1001 Spikes great also hurts it. The difficulty does ramp up pretty damn high. At first I was playing this game together with my girlfriend, and that was awesome - the levels are well designed for multiple players. But eventually I had to dump her because we were progressing too slowly together. It's hard to concentrate with a group of people when playing such a difficult game.\n\nSo I guess if I had to complain about something, I'd say more could have been done to make this game more accessible. Maybe an easy mode? Or maybe the whole game should have just been easier in general. I love it as it is, but I would have liked to play the whole thing with friends.","December 5, 2015","true","18.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","15","18","3","1"

There's basically a death trap everywhere you step, so if you manage to pass a death trap, you'll die by another one. It's fun trying to run away from all the death traps, and complete the levels as fast as possible. The Skulls and unlockable characters make it even more fun, and they give a lot of replay value. And just when you though you're done with the game, now that you completed World 5, BOOM! Another 5 worlds (Antarctica) Gets unlocked, And they're x5 times more difficult than Ukampa! Everytime you die, you want to try again, and again and again. And everytime you die, you get better. You probably think this is a negative review, you're wrong. Doing all this stuff I listened makes the game a lot of fun, the levels are well-designed, and there are surprised everywhere. There's even Local Co-Op, and extra game modes, which are a lot of fun too! I'm giving this game a solid 10/10, of course, I completed the whole Story Mode. Making a review without experiencing everything is a little stupid in my opinion. Yesterday I spend 12 hours straight in this game. It's really addicting, and the graphics are beatiful. If you like Hard games, pick this up immediately, you even get a "33% Off" discount if you own Cave Story+ or NightSky, which makes the game cost only 6,66€ If you already bought this game, I'm just going to say one thing: Good Luck!","June 16, 2014","true","84.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

With pixel-perfect controls that are very comfortable, this game takes you through beautiful yet deadly maps, all flawlessly and cleverly designed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nitman99/recommended/260790/","Nitman99","Nitman99","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nitman99/","2197 products in account","Disclaimer: If you inherently can’t stand timing-based platforming and a certain level of trial-and-error/memorization, this game is not for you.\n\nMario really changed platforming huh? I mean he pretty much created it with his appearance in Donkey Kong, but it was Super Mario Bros. that defined core platforming mechanics for years to come. Chief among these is the jumping itself: SMB added a momentum based system as well as variable jump lengths depending on how long you held down the button. Put these together and you had a game that just felt better than any other game at the time. Fast forward to today and we’re in a resurgence of the genre, with a new SMB, Super Meat Boy, taking its place as king with the most refined Mario controls to date.\n\nHow does 1001 Spikes fit into this? Well…\n\n1001 Spikes scales back the jump mechanics to pre-Super Mario Bros.; there’s no momentum system or variable jump based on length of button press. Instead, there are just two jumps: a jump that clears 1 tile and a jump that clears 2 tiles.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well as far as negatives go it means that you never get the same sense of great game feel as you do in Super Meat Boy. That’s not to say the game feels bad though; you can change the direction of your jumps in mid-air, so it’s not clunky like Castlevania or Ghosts n’ Goblins. It also means that it’s more accessible; you have to worry less about mastering a complex physics system and more about your timing and reflexes. With more reliable jumps you can also have more daunting challenges, without a lot of the error in the trial-and-error.\n\nBut the biggest thing it facilitates is puzzles. It’s not always advantageous to use the high jump, even with jump correction; the game makes you use both. You see, most of the game’s obstacles are traps, with slight visual clues of where they could be. This works synergistically with the jump system; you’ll have to constantly think on your feet about where traps could be located and how to handle them, but because of the rigid jumping you’ll also have to problem solve about what sequence of jumps and landings to use to get you to your goal. There are a lot of “puzzle platformers” out there but more often than not they’re puzzle games that just happen to be platformers. This game uses platforming as its puzzle mechanics; rarely do I see a game so multifaceted and yet so singular in its design. Even once you’ve carved out a path you’ll still have to think quickly to execute it; unlike platformers like Meat Boy there’s no clear break in between obstacles. Traps add an extra sense of cohesion to the levels as you have to keep moving and thinking on your feet with no time to catch your breath. It’s a really unique feeling for a platformer, and frankly it’s exhausting at first. But as you play more, you’ll get better at the game and at the quick thinking and memorization needed to complete each level. While the game doesn’t build in the sense of reward like Super Meat Boy does, it doesn’t really need it; by the time you beat each level, you’ll have gained the satisfaction of solving a puzzle and of executing tight platforming in one.\n\nThis is all reinforced by a smart lives system where you have to actually learn how to play the game, and not just muscle through it like Meat Boy, so that you can preserve your lives and prevent yourself from starting over from the beginning. It – oh wait, you don’t have to start over? You just get three more lives? …Then what’s the point?\n\nThis is the start of a few baffling decisions; why have a life system at all? Or a level skip option? Why is there a store anyway? I get that it creates a strong connection between the side modes and characters and the real gameplay as Aban but it ends up feeling grindy and “pay-to-win”.\n\nSpeaking of side modes and characters, this game has a lot of content! There’s a single screen Mario Bros. style fighting game, a Kid Icarus style climbing game with scroll locking, and The Lost Levels, which actually is the game I expected except in short form, with a reduced number of levels and only 101 lives, but a Game Over if you lose them all. It doesn’t introduce any new mechanics but it does put them together in new ways, and to be honest a shortened form probably works better for that Game Over concept anyway.\n\nThe best part of the game though is the level design. With rigid jumps and movement speeds there’s already a lot of potential for fine-tuned gauntlets to jump through, with a lot of pixel-perfect platforming that really matches the aesthetic and gives you the feeling that nothing about this experience should have been any different. But what’s great is how it layers it: every level has a teaching layer, a “get through the level the first time” layer, and a speedrunning multiple path layer, and everything in the game is created with these layers in mind, all without ever sacrificing internal logic. There are no scripted events here; everything is created using the tools given, and anticipation of how the player will tackle it. So let’s say there’s some spikes on a timer, and there seems to be a conveniently different colored block as a safe spot. Well that block is going to have logic to it; it’s not going to be just arbitrarily discolored, but discolored because, it has hidden spikes in it, or maybe it’s actually a cracked block and will break when you stand on it. When all of these layers and the logic within them come together it creates a world that feels like it existed before you and will continue to exist after you’re gone, rather than just a series of arbitrary obstacles. You create the timings yourself, there isn’t one set way you have to do it; a favorite mechanic of mine includes pushing a sliding ice block, that you can jump on and ride. Its velocity is set and firm, but it’s up to you to set it into motion, not the game. This is a damn fine platformer, and in my opinion, probably bests Super Meat Boy as my favorite to date.","July 19, 2014","true","60.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Well let's expect to die a couple times to either spikes coming out of the ground or some boulder falling on my head because I'm trying to dodge the completely obvious traps first."\n\nBut that's where the fun comes from...\nFirst entering a stage and figuring out where the next spike-trap is that's gonna kill you and having a sense of pride come to you when you just barely jump to safety. Only to have your hopes and dreams shot down by a statue that fires a dart in your face, but don't worry you remember exactly where that spike-trap is and to throw a knife to block the statue's dart only to land and the floor falls from under you... Welcome to the wonderful life of Aban Hawkins.\n\nThe level progression of the game is pretty good. They don't just throw everything at you from the get-go and expect you to be absolutely afraid of every step you take through Ukampa. Every 5 stages you get a nice little break in the action to just walk peacefully through the temple to get the key and progress to the next chapter.\n\nThe controls are solid, there's no momentum in the game so you stop moving Aban and he instantly stops moving but the thing that might get you at first is there's two jump buttons. There were a few times where I'd franticly be jumping and throwing my knives, dodging traps and just suddenly find myself fall down a pit because instead of doing a high-jump, I had hit the normal-jump button.\n\nThe game's decently long and along the way you can collect Golden Skulls (There's 30 of them, one in each stage) and once you get so many you start unlocking other modes to play (All the unlocked modes can be play with up to 4-players).\n-There's a tower mode where you pick your character, climb a tower to save a princess and collect treasure along the way.\n-There's Lost Levels mode where you pick a character again, and go through chapters which consist of 3 stages and each chapter is a tileset from the campaign mode and each stage has coins you can collect.\n-There's a mode that was meant for 4-players. You hit a golden chalice for coins to pop-out and try to see who can get the most coins before time runs out.\nYou will also start to unlock other characters which have their own unique gameplay mechanics.\n\nIt's one of those rare platformers that really makes you feel like you acomplished something great once you beat it. All that hardwork, all those tears, all those controllers you broke along the way and if that wasn't enough for some of you, you can also play through the entire thing again as a different character to unlock their own cutscenes.\n\nA fantastic game worth every penny!","February 4, 2015","true","17.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The game will provide you with few hours of entertainment for the main campaign only - and few other gamemodes plus local multiplayer are what you can play right after.\n\nTo me, it is my third favorite platformer, right after Super Meat Boy and Electronic Super Joy.","June 21, 2015","true","9.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

We've played Indiana Jones-themed platformers (La Mulana and Spelunky), short-level-many-lives platformers (Super Meat Boy, I Wanna Be The Guy), and technologically accurate retro homages (Shovel Knight). It's unfortunate because 1001 Spikes is all these things, but it's also something more.\nIt tosses out the fiddly analog jumping of Super Meat Boy in favor of digital two-button jumping. You know where your jumps are going to take you, even if you play blindfolded. The challenge is picking the right place and time to jump. There are no leaps of faith. The limited pallet of hazards allows you to grow muscle memory. Far from being an exercise in trial and error, 1001 Spikes is a game you can get good at. My second playthrough took 10% as long as my first.\nInstead of the single-screen levels of Super Meat Boy, you have levels that you can't finish while holding your breath. There are parts where you really have to think hard about how you can pass an obstacle. There are shortcuts. If Super Meat Boy is a triceps dip, 1001 Spikes is a push-up.\nIf you've played IWTBTG, you'll know that that game can kill you in ways that are funny. 1001 Spikes has jokes too, but they are funnier.\n1001 Spikes has a story, and a damn good one. It's told in Ninja Gaiden style cutscenes which are long but don't overstay their welcome. It's about a love-hate relationship. The protagonist goes on an adventure to prove something to himself -- when you play this game it will be to prove something to yourself. 1001 Spikes is a Japanese indie game, and when it comes to story it seems like Japanese indie developers can do something that Americans can't.

So, you get platforms that drop away from under you with no warning, spikes that appear out of perfectly normal looking blocks, and enemies that don't behave in predictable ways.\n\nFor example, I was stuck on level 2-5 for ages, because there was absolutely NO indication anywhere previously that the projectiles you shoot will nullify enemy fire.

This is like if Dark Souls was made for adults. You will never leave the ruins of Ukampa Temple alive.\n\nDid any of these made you feel scared, afraid or panicked? If so, get out.\n\nThe rest of you, keep listening.\n\nI ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. Ever been into Rick Dangerous, La-Mulana, Cave Story, Spelunky or Super Meat Boy? If so, good because this should be right down your alley then. This game looks, sounds and plays like 8-bit title from the mid to late 80's, but the level- and game design is all 2014, baby. And don't let the limited color palette or resolution startle you, this game is audiovisually gorgeous - at least if you can appreciate real games made for grownups.\n\nThe controls are really sharp, responsive and overall snappy. One of the favourite things about this game is that you can only move, throw daggers and jump either a small jump or big jump - both controlled by separate buttons. There's none of the slick fluid like movement and variable running speed or jumping heights, instead you have super accurate controls, so controlling Aban to his death feels ever so good and precise!\n\nSpeaking of death, there's plenty of that packed in this bundle of fun and joy! There's SO many ways you can die in this game, and guess what? It's all your fault! My favourite part about this game is that it gets gradually harder and harder, but never it becomes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to play. No matter how tricky construction of death and misery is in front of you, you can always tell them before hand: Subtle changes on the tiles, lack of foliages, bit of animation, maybe sound effect or bit of delay and effect before your inevitable death and decay. It might feel cheap, but each level can be eventually figured out and mastered, and you're gonna feel ♥♥♥♥ing great as you do so - even more if you happen to find one of the hidden golden skulls.\n\nI also wanna say right now that this game does not compare to I Wanna Be The Guy - because I Wanna Be The Guy is not a hard game for a good reason. IWBTG is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing game and prime example of how you should not design a game. Having completed that game, I have all the right to call it a ♥♥♥♥ing garbage it definetly is.\n\nAnyhow! Still interested? Good! The game actually does have a plot of some sort, that is delivered in the similar subtly animated still anime frames like in the NES Ninja Gaiden series. There's also a whole new continent to explore on a New Game+, variable multiplayer options and also "lost levels" during the development time that you can try out for your pleasure. There's plenty of unlockable character, each with their own special abilities, you can buy stuff to be unlocked in the game's store and it has also couple really, really well hidden super secrets I'm not gonna even spoil.\n\nAs far as I know, I have no gripes with this game. Some people with third party controllers had some issues, but the game's been updated few times and the Steam Forums have workarounds for those issues in case you stumble into any.\n\nTL;DR This game is like if Dark Souls was made for adults in 8-bit glory. You will become a man after this game (even if you're a woman, there will be chesthair and beard everywhere). You will love and you will hate this game, and you're ♥♥♥♥ing glad that you didn't miss this one out.\n\n11/10, would spike again.","June 27, 2014","true","18.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That being said, I'm glad to see this title come to Steam.\n\nI purchased 1001 Spikes for $1.00 on Xbox Live Indie about 4 or 5 years ago. That game was by far the most frustrating, unforgiving torture I've ever put myself through. While the Steam version of this game is hard, the Xbox Live Indie version was at least 10x tougher. Even though it has been quite a few years, I still remember many of the levels and I have noticed that they're toned down a lot. At least in this version of the game, the spikes take about two seconds to come out of the ground whereas before it was immediate.\n\nNow, onward with the review of the Steam version. You start the game with 999 lives. It is not enough. It will never be enough. It may seem like a lot of lives, but this game is all about trial, error and remembering your trials and errors. Anxious to get back to where you died? You better not forget about that falling block or those hidden spikes. This game is not for pansies; there are no checkpoints. The next level is your checkpoint.\n\nIt's good to see that the game has a story now, where as in the XBLI version there was no story. You're a semi-young adventurer, your father hates you, left all of your inheritance to your sister and instead gave you a map to discover long-lost hidden treasures. The story is told through awesome NES style 8-bit panels. The main level map is set up like Ghosts N' Goblins, which is quite fitting seeing as 1001 Spikes has a difficulty that's almost on par with the old NES classic.\n\nThe art is fantastic, the music is engaging, the level designs are irritably entertaining, the controls are smooth and the story progression is enough to be prominent but not overwhelming. I cannot recommend this game enough to fans of platforming who enjoy a powerful retro-level challenge. I'm proud to see how far 1001 Spikes has come since its days on Xbox Live Indie, and I'm glad to see that it has gained a warm reception on Steam. In my opinion, $16.99 CAD is a little steep for this game, though. I'd draw the line at about $10.00.\n\nRating: 5.0/5.0 - An amazing achievement, this game must be played.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","November 2, 2015","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's not even a challenging platformer, it's a troll platformer, as fans of this "genre" have so affectionately named it. Although it might be more appropriate it to call it a trial-and-error puzzler like Limbo, albeit with none of the charm and no checkpoints whatsoever.\n\nThe basic idea of the game is that everything kills you instantly, fair enough. But you never know when or how. So you're forced to repeat a stage over and over again until you have memorized every single trap, hurdle enemy and surprise. There's basically little to no skill involved, as most of the jumps are fairly easy to do. There's not much in the way of puzzle solving or abstract thinking either. The only skill required is a good memory.\n\nIf that sounds fun to you, you'll love this game. But if you're a fan of games like Super Meat Boy, La Mulana, Battleblock Theater, you'll probably hate this game, and I don't recommend checking it out.\n\nIn its favor, the game has an interesting little story, decent pixel art, local multiplayer and catchy music. But I'll likely never experience those things, because the game itself is irritating instead of fun or engaging.\n\nEven though it's not quite the same genre, if you're thinking of picking up 1001 Spikes, pick up La Mulana instead. Very similar aesthetic, very similar attitude, but a much better game overall.","July 19, 2014","false","0.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Once a controller was connected, I began playing, and from what I'v played, it has good mechanics and nice level design. It is very challenging like old NES games.

Somehow a game styled on 8-bit graphics began lagging for me on a system that damn well ought to be able to handle it.

And I won't tell you that the game is hard, any other user review or critic can tell you and probably has told you that. If you just want a hard game then 1001 Spikes is totally for you and you should already know that. This user review however is for those out there who want to know the answer to the question "What is 1001 Spikes, other than hard?"\n\nAnd the answer is almost nothing. Its a nostalgic hard game and seemingly nothing more. It seems to have no goal but kill you endlessly with surprise deathtraps that seem inspired by some strange and horrid idea that I Wanna Be The Guy should be viewed with anything but irony. The majority of my deaths playing this game so far have felt cheap and put there merely to make me replay the same content over and over. The game doesn't feel like a spicy challenge, but more of an unwanted chore.\n\nEven within its niche 1001 Spikes doesn't seem that good. Super Meat Boy had better controls, felt generally fair and had a stronger art direction. La Mulana which has quite similar elements although is part of a different subgenre of nostalgic hard platformers offers a great sense of exploration and mystery. 1001 Spikes offers a lot of spikes and warningless deathes.\n\nSo to those out there who want more than just a hard game. Move on, 1001 Spikes seems to having nothing to offer you.","June 5, 2014","false","1.4"," 22 of 50 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","22","50","0","0"

This isn't Super Meat Boy or Rogue Legacy hard, no... This is Bullsh*t hard like Ghost & Goblins and I Wanna be the Guy Gaiden!\n(Although I wanna be the guy gaiden can be excused since that game was deliberately made with the intent that it's bullsh*t where this game was not)\nThe Multiplayer elements of this game aren't worth your time in the slightest, the levels are poorly designed with bullsh*t traps as a main source of difficulty and overall I just cannot reccomend this game in the slightest. Now there were parts of this game I did legitimately enjoy and the Tower of Nanar feels like the way they should've designed this game but the problem is that with all the horrible hidden traps and sooo much waiting for certain levels and stages which go on for over a minute I just cannot reccomend this game in the slightest even if you are a fan of this genre I just can't reccomend it.\n\nThe only good thing I can really say about this game is the Spritework and the Music. The 8-Bit Spritework is very pleasent to look at and is animated pretty well and the soundtrack is just absoloutly wonderful with my favourite themes being the tower of Nanar Stage 5 and World 4 but if the best thing about your game is the graphics and music then why even bother spending your money on this?\n\nOverall this game just isn't worth your time or money and instead of being looked at and acknowledged we should probably just leave it alone and let time forget this.","July 20, 2014","false","22.1"," 10 of 26 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","10","26","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BertieWooster/recommended/260790/","BertieWooster","William Shakesman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BertieWooster/","1087 products in account","It's one of those games. You know the sort. Spikes pop up out of the ground and then spike shooters nail you when you jump over them and then you have to ride a moving platform that slides just enough that you can't counter the spike shooters with your own projectiles and then there's a big long segment of precise jumps where you have to jump JUST as the moving platforms disappear. But the level is really short so you just keep doing it over and over and over and over again until you get it all just right and then you're rewarded with another harder and yet still tedious level to attempt over and over and over and over until you beat it and shrug or are overcome by ennui and find something more rewarding to do with your time.\n\nIt's a competent if unimpressive example of the genre, the sort that looks like an NES game but plays like absolutely none of them. Ditching Meat Boy's awful sliding physics, Aban has a two button jump that sounds weird but is just marvelous in execution, the high jump especially is noteworthy. While it does clear two blocks of height, it has all the natural arc of a graceful plumber soaring through the air rather than the sprongy up and down of some dismal C64 era protagonist. Mega Man wishes he handled this well. The music and graphics do the job without irritating (Unless you like 30 second loops, I recommend you avoid trying to pay extra for the soundtrack. Sample it first, at least.).\n\nAnyone who suggests that it transcends the genre is full of poppycock and balderdash. It's bog standard from top to bottom. You could do worse if you must have more, but I know you, reader; you're only here because you probably already have Meat Boy and likely six others in the genre. Have you truly beaten Meat Boy? Cleared every good Castlevania and Mega Man? Perhaps La Mulana if that's your thing. I'm fairly certain you have not beaten that one. If you like the repetition, I tend to find going for the 1cc in the shmups on Steam to be generally more rewarding... I mean, really, there's nothing here you have not seen before.\n\nBut if it sounds like I am full of it and this is still exactly what you want in a game, then, by all means. It is definitely competent in execution by any standard, nailing the design and feel and there's a a decent bit of variety and a gradual difficulty curve. If you played Spelunky or Rogue Legacy before this, you'll have a whole new appreciation for REAL levels, DESIGNED levels (And then quickly a new hatred for them.) when you take Aban for a swing.\n\nBut I must still attempt to warn you off into more satisfying endeavors.\n\nEDIT: By the way, that o in endeavors at the end? It was a spike trap. Sorry. You'll have to read the review again and take care to avoid that next time.\n\nEDIT Part Deux: I must return to mention this when I think of Aban's adventure. It's not entirely unexpected in the genre but the game does offer quite a few paths to facilitate speedrunning (Which, really, as a hobby is really a close cousin to  this ghastly genre.). Some of them are goofy secret paths to bypass a few traps here and there (Oh what a game where the reward for clever play is to play less of the game. Seems an apt enough reward.) but a few do turn out to be clever synergies in the game's various timing mechanics where, with rhythm toned to the beat, you can zoom through a segment you might have paused and considered carefully before. Discovering those tended to be far more rewarding to me than actually completing the levels I found them in.","June 10, 2014","false","7.2"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","5","19","0","0"

The game does not require fast reflexes or platforming skill. If you stop, look, and plan out what you're going to do, you can theoretically avoid every trap in the game. The game never really throws anything truly unexpected at you, but it will still kill you hundreds of times. You will fall for the same traps over and over again and curse your own stupidity.\n\nYou will navigate a really tricky part, see what looks like safe ground, stop there for a mere second to get your bearings, and get killed by spikes rising from the floor, even though you had more than enough time to see them coming and avoid them. You will see the exit, make a mad dash for it, and get blasted in the face by a dart shooter that was right there in plain sight. Both of these things will happen to you repeatedly, even after you've identified the pattern and made a mental note to look out for them.\n\nThe music is really great too, and there's a rich amount of bonus content to enjoy, with the Towers of Nannar and the Lost Levels, and more than a dozen characters to play as.","January 8, 2015","true","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Intuitive level design teaches you the game as you play as opposed to relying on tutorials, which is a refreshing change in this modern day of games that often treat the player like an idiot. It has two main sets of levels, a fairly good difficulty curve, with some spikes (hah) in difficulty here and there. Also has a daunting old school lives system with game over at 0 lives, encouraging careful play and  effort to act upon mistakes and progress. However, progression is rewarded very generously. The boss battles are sequential and a bit random, but not unbearable. There are some extra game modes and features as well as an entire roster of characters to try, for the full experience. Overall a very fun and challenging game.","January 3, 2015","true","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Did They Bleed Pixels make you break out in hives?  Masocore platforming wonders though they be, both of these games prostrate themselves before the blood-splattered feet of Aban Hawkins and the 1001 Spikes.  It's hardcore!\n\nBut it is far from unfair, and that is a big portion what makes the game so good.  Yes, 1001 Spikes demands some of the most nitpicky platforming precision in all of neoretro gaming, and it will frequently cheapshot you as you stand, exhaling pent-up breath, before the level exit --  but it can be mastered, and the controls are both sensitive and simple enough for you to smoothly handle any challenge it throws at you.  You never run out of chances to triumph, either; though the game pretends to give you 1001 lives, that is nothing more than an arbitrary counter to increase the feeling of tension as you watch it decrease by the hundreds.  You'll actually get a few extra automatically whenever you run out (not that this ever happened to me, I am proud to say).  Funny thing is, even knowing this, you still get nervous watching those lives dwindle.  I'm sure Philip Zimbardo could do a study on that . . .\n\nThe levels are very short, but they have such marvelous flow to them they you'll play obsessively once you've started one, even if it takes you 150 faux lives to beat!  And since the game's many levels have an astonishing amount of variety (save those ubiquitous spikes), you won't stop saying "just one more stage!" until you drop from exhaustion.  One level you're almost playing Lode Runner, and the next you're jumping on Mega Man-style vanishing blocks and shooting metroids!\n\nThe visuals and sound hit that neoretro sweetspot!  Sprites are rendered charmingly, with just enough frames of animation to look smooth whilst remaining authentic.  The level graphics are NES-ideal:  detailed to the very limit of 8-bit, but without the visual muddiness which plagues even some of the best classic games.  The pixelated cinematics, through which the game's light (and very cute) narrative is delivered, are crunchy-gorgeous.  The sound effects are perfectly adequate, and the music is strong enough to stand apart from the game.\n\nThis game is nearly perfect in every aspect!  If you like neoretro or hardcore platforming, you must purchase Aban Hawkins and the 1001 Spikes!  The game is brutally difficult, addictive, lovingly crafted . . .  and oddly sweet-natured.  Just get it, you'll see what I mean.","January 4, 2015","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have initially 1001 lives to try to conquer the ruins of Ukampa, but fret not: they ARE plenty, and you can always buy more lives for a relatively easy to acquire in-game currency (and cheaply) that you get from playing the side missions (at no cost to your current stock of lives, too).\n\nGameplay is simple: you are a man (or a woman, or a zombie, or a robot... unlockable character) that has an attack to deal with nasty scorpions and dart traps, and you can jump both high and low. Knowing when to jump how high is the key to the basic game, as is timing and learning trap patterns to safely avoid the very-much-so-avoidable untimely death.\n\nBut, perhaps this isn't what you wanted to hear about 1001 Spikes, so let's talk difficulty. The game is quite simple, but it may take a while to master and is definitely not a walk in the park for those that aren't used to playing platformers nor have the patience to deal with repeatedly dying in a level. I consider myself a pretty good gamer in this type of games and I cleared the (basic first half of the) game with about 180 deaths in total for the span of Ukampa; having just unlocked the Antarctic I can already say that the challenges are just beggining for me.\n\nAnd, since some people aren't that great, you can at least visit all levels by skipping some. Just... don't get disheartened by seeing the difficulty increase as well; arguably, the different levels test different competences of yours to different degrees, so chances are that you can clear the levels past the ones you might skip.\n\nI mentioned the unlockable characters, and I'd like to add that they are significantly different from the default character, Aban Hawkins. From speed diferences to attack differences to air-jump actions, they are all unique in their strengths. If you simply care about reaching the end of the game, unlocking all of the characters will require you to clear most of the game with Aban while collecting golden skulls... but still very early on you can unlock cool characters like "Master Chef", the powersuit assault-rifle-toting badass, which will have an easier time with dart traps for instance. Oh, and just so you know, each unlockable has their own levels (i.e., they are the same, but to reach 3-2 you have to have cleared 3-1 with that specific character; you can't unlock a level on other characters to move forward).\n\nI didn't really want to get too deep with this review, but I feel I must also mention the local multiplayer. Basically, you can complete a set of levels with your friends to earn some of the ingame currency or even all by yourself in what I mentioned as "side missions" at the beggining. The Tower is a very interesting place to earn some coins, but if you're into the Lost Levels and are good at it you can rake the money in even faster. If you simply want to go head-to-head and out-coin your friends you can also play in mini arenas. I can't comment on how fun they are since I can't experience them in their full glory, as the friends I have wouldn't even touch a controller for the purpose of avoiding some spikes and collecting coins, but I imagine that if you have like-minded friends that wouldn't mind giving it a go this could be extremely hilarious on several places. Just remember: ONLY LOCAL multiplayer, NOT ONLINE.\n\nThe music is good, the sound are great too. Visually you've already seen a trailer, so I can only say that in my opinion everything feels in place. There's also plenty of humour in the cutscenes and nifty references to older games, and 1001 Spikes is a good challenge for a world that refuses to churn out platformers in favour of whatever else gimmicky sandbox people seem to love, so it would get an instant recommendation from me just for that, but I can safely say that this game is plenty good from what I have already played...\n\nAlso, don't disregard the game for its price. It may be almost 10€ without a discount, but owning some of Nicalis' previous games (i.e. the same publisher) it lowers automatically by 33% instantly, and it usually stacks with other discounts of 33% (for 66% off total price). And chances are that if you're reading this you may already have some of them, or at least Cave Story, on Steam.","January 1, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After Super Meat Boy and I Wanna Be The Guy had passed we all thought our controllers were safe from the brutal fits brought on by those games, well the restraining order is needed once more with the guys that brought you Cave Story, Nicalis’s throw back to NES style platforming, 1001 Spikes along with its tagline\n‘The Temple of the Dead Mourns the Living’ (a nice way of saying prepare to die noob).\n\nOur tale is of one Aban Hawkins, who while being son to a wealthy archaeologist is left in the dirt to fend for himself; one day upon hearing of his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ father’s disappearance he his handed a letter containing a map to the ancient door of Poko-Mum and the fabled treasures said to lie within.\nPartly to prove himself and mostly in hopes of finding his father and kicking his ♥♥♥, our young Indiana Jon- *cough* I mean, our young Aban Hawkins takes it upon himself to challenge the trials of 1001 spikes.\n\nAs you make your first steps into the ruins untouched by civilization and painted in the left overs of other would-be-adventurers you’ll notice you start off with a generous 1001 lives; you will then quickly discover how little that is. Straight up 1001 spikes is a brutal platformer that will have you crying, laughing and occasionally a combination of the two as you combine all your efforts into precise actions, exact timings and copious amounts of luck to make your way to victory (well to the first few levels at least).\nFollowing the trend Super Meat Boy set, 1001 spikes will see you dying, more frequently than you’ll admit as you attempt to survive the deadly gauntlets filled with spikes, pressure sensitive panels, flamethrowers, falling blocks, scorpions and Hollywood’s infamous cliché, poison blow darts.\n\nWith only a jump, high jump and dagger throw as the only tools at your disposal you will have to analyse, scrutinize and brave you’re way through the story modes 60+ uniquely crafted gems of absurd torture and numbing delight.\n1001 delivers a very terrifying yet enjoyable experience as you progress though each level (losing upwards of 50 lives each time if you’re lucky) going through an admittedly abusive learning period; however 1001 spikes isn’t just a platformer with skull crushing difficulty, instead it utilizes a very clever level design where each trap has its own behaviour that will have players (and their fellow guinea pigs) repeatedly rethinking how they approach each assault course within an assault course while keeping their eyes on the prize the key, and it’s corresponding exit.\n\nAfter several deaths along with the feeling the deaths of a thousand poor sods you will feel the muscle memory ingrained into your actions as the process turns from scrutinizing to performing that pixel precision needed to succeed. It’s a clever sensation fed to us that has you coming back for one more go (one hundred more goes more like it), once you crack the puzzle completing the level becomes an addictive adrenaline pumping challenge that promotes skill that offers reward along with a sense of achievement knowing you finished the level knowing it was cause you mastered it.\n\nNot smashing controllers fast enough, sick of blaming yourself for dying?\nNot to threat as 1001 spikes offers a drop in/out 4 player local Co Op so you can die, together;\nOddly enough this does not make the game any less challenging than it was (in fact it makes it harder in a lot of cases) it does however make the experience all the more enjoyable and is in fact one of the most gut wrenchingly hilarious games I’ve had the pleasure of playing with friends in a long time.\nWhile it makes certain scenarios harder the enjoyment from planning together brings about some very organic cooperative excitement like that seen in Spelunky, or even those moments when one or two members start to get a bit vindictive it doesn’t grief the overall experience and can in fact enhance it has you blow of some steam (and some lives in the process admittedly).\nIf you’re sick of getting each other killed accidently you can also head to the Mario bros-esque mini game The Golden Vase where the aim is to get the most coins from in each level whilst avoiding several deadly traps and each other.\n\n\n\nThrough each level in the story mode you’ll notice that there is a golden skull placed in each level, while at first they seem to offer nothing more than an extra life (which you’ll probably lose the second you grab it) once enough are collected you will start to unlock various characters and modes forcing you to enjoy those levels all over again if you didn’t pick any skulls up.\nEach unlockable character performs somewhat differently from each other like Tina, Aban’s sister who is able to cling to walls, or the Tempura can double jump with his submachine gun. It really does offer a whole new experience playing through levels as different characters however for player one to play as one of them means you have to start their own campaign through the same levels which does make it a bit repetitive; you can have your buddies bring these characters along with them though which makes Co Op all the more enjoyable and far less disorientating (trying to pay attention to which Aban is yours with four players is hell for the eyes).\n\nAlong with a pleasing art style and musical aesthetic that would find itself right at home on the NES,\n1001 Spikes is a brutal platformer, but is a rewarding one for those willing to dive right in.\nFor those who were fans of Super Meat Boy will find themselves right at home with this game and even the casuals from Super Mario Bros. might latch onto it if they can get over the difficulty curve; in the end Nicalis’ 1001 Spikes has so far gave me nine hours of pure enjoyment (and occasionally fits of rage) both playing on my own and with friends where I’ve barely scratched the surface.\nThe game offers far more content than it lets on that will literally have you drowning (lovingly) in hours of replayability that only suffers from the lack of an online multiplayer.\n\nPros:\nClever level design,\nGenuinely enjoyable couch Co Op gameplay,\nVariety of modes to unlock,\nAddictively balanced.\n\nCons:\nSomewhat brutal difficulty curves,\nCan get quiet frustrating,\nDoesn’t come with protection for your controller.\n\nFinal Verdict,\n1001 Spikes easily scores a 1001/10.\n\nWritten by,\nWhistler\n\nLike the review?

Intuitive level design teaches you the game as you play as opposed to relying on tutorials, which is a refreshing change in this modern day of games that often treat the player like an idiot. It has two main sets of levels, a fairly good difficulty curve, with some spikes (hah) in difficulty here and there. Also has a daunting old school lives system with game over at 0 lives, encouraging careful play and  effort to act upon mistakes and progress. However, progression is rewarded very generously. The boss battles are sequential and a bit random, but not unbearable. There are some extra game modes and features as well as an entire roster of characters to try, for the full experience.

You have initially 1001 lives to try to conquer the ruins of Ukampa, but fret not: they ARE plenty, and you can always buy more lives for a relatively easy to acquire in-game currency (and cheaply) that you get from playing the side missions (at no cost to your current stock of lives, too).\n\nGameplay is simple: you are a man (or a woman, or a zombie, or a robot... unlockable character) that has an attack to deal with nasty scorpions and dart traps, and you can jump both high and low. Knowing when to jump how high is the key to the basic game, as is timing and learning trap patterns to safely avoid the very-much-so-avoidable untimely death.\n\nBut, perhaps this isn't what you wanted to hear about 1001 Spikes, so let's talk difficulty. The game is quite simple, but it may take a while to master and is definitely not a walk in the park for those that aren't used to playing platformers nor have the patience to deal with repeatedly dying in a level. I consider myself a pretty good gamer in this type of games and I cleared the (basic first half of the) game with about 180 deaths in total for the span of Ukampa; having just unlocked the Antarctic I can already say that the challenges are just beggining for me.\n\nAnd, since some people aren't that great, you can at least visit all levels by skipping some. Just... don't get disheartened by seeing the difficulty increase as well; arguably, the different levels test different competences of yours to different degrees, so chances are that you can clear the levels past the ones you might skip.\n\nI mentioned the unlockable characters, and I'd like to add that they are significantly different from the default character, Aban Hawkins. From speed diferences to attack differences to air-jump actions, they are all unique in their strengths. If you simply care about reaching the end of the game, unlocking all of the characters will require you to clear most of the game with Aban while collecting golden skulls... but still very early on you can unlock cool characters like "Master Chef", the powersuit assault-rifle-toting badass, which will have an easier time with dart traps for instance. Oh, and just so you know, each unlockable has their own levels (i.e., they are the same, but to reach 3-2 you have to have cleared 3-1 with that specific character; you can't unlock a level on other characters to move forward).\n\nI didn't really want to get too deep with this review, but I feel I must also mention the local multiplayer. Basically, you can complete a set of levels with your friends to earn some of the ingame currency or even all by yourself in what I mentioned as "side missions" at the beggining. The Tower is a very interesting place to earn some coins, but if you're into the Lost Levels and are good at it you can rake the money in even faster. If you simply want to go head-to-head and out-coin your friends you can also play in mini arenas. I can't comment on how fun they are since I can't experience them in their full glory, as the friends I have wouldn't even touch a controller for the purpose of avoiding some spikes and collecting coins, but I imagine that if you have like-minded friends that wouldn't mind giving it a go this could be extremely hilarious on several places. Just remember: ONLY LOCAL multiplayer, NOT ONLINE.\n\nThe music is good, the sound are great too. Visually you've already seen a trailer, so I can only say that in my opinion everything feels in place. There's also plenty of humour in the cutscenes and nifty references to older games, and 1001 Spikes is a good challenge for a world that refuses to churn out platformers in favour of whatever else gimmicky sandbox people seem to love, so it would get an instant recommendation from me just for that, but I can safely say that this game is plenty good from what I have already played...\n\nAlso, don't disregard the game for its price. It may be almost 10€ without a discount, but owning some of Nicalis' previous games (i.e. the same publisher) it lowers automatically by 33% instantly, and it usually stacks with other discounts of 33% (for 66% off total price). And chances are that if you're reading this you may already have some of them, or at least Cave Story, on Steam.","January 1, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is AS ADVERTISED as in you get a crap load of lives and your'e gonna die a ♥♥♥♥ load. Though I am thinking about it and later on in the game it's really very heavily oriented in muscle memory. I hate these kinds of games where you just keep dying until you know EXACTLY what you're supposed to do. And I HATE how this is advertised as HARD even though any schlub can repeat the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again until the dumbass remembers where everything is.\n\nWith that said that wasn't always the case and even still the game is pretty enjoyable. I really REALLY like the music. It's my type of stuff. I don't know the exact description and all for it, but I'd say 'think nintendo music' ish? The aesthetic is retro too which is fine. I find the overall aesthetic/music and such to be a plus and pretty satisfying overall.\n\nIn terms of controls, they're pretty simple and they work very well. It's also pretty neat that you can play as other characters. I don't particularly give a ♥♥♥♥ about cross overs or anything, but the fact the other guys function differently is unique in my opinion. You complete levels a little differently with everyone and to me that's pretty cool.\n\nLevel design is solid...for the game I suppose. I grew pretty accustomed to expected every ♥♥♥♥ing wall to hold spikes ready to impale my chest or every ♥♥♥♥ing block to start collapsing out from under me. In this regard the game is actually pretty god damn short extended out by the ♥♥♥♥ing fact that you spend so much time dying. I DON'T like that. I would prefer longer levels with checkpoints a little closer to mario and more content overall as well.\n\nI'm also a little upset Mplayer is local only. You have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue how hard it is to get my brother to play something with me and he sits only a few feet away playing his PC ♥♥♥♥ too. Bearing that in mind I won't say ♥♥♥♥ about the Mplayer other than that because I couldn't play it.\n\nAgain, I feel a bit iffy recommending because of the ad infinium nausea, but I like the game and it's charm. I felt the story was kinda...expected...but it was ok. It was all ok in the end and pretty worth it.

The game has a simple tutorial and eases the challenge up from one level to the next till you enter the ruins. While a good portion of the game may seem to be mostly trial and error, there are many subtle hints that can point out where traps can be. Even if you were to get trapped by something new and you didn't have enough time to react to it, the 1001 lives given to you mitigates the possible stress of a game over.\n\nOverall, it's pretty dang good. Seriously, you feel badass whenever you complete a level. Also Rushjet did an awesome job on the music. Love that dude's work.","July 20, 2014","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've beaten every level in the game exactly once, but I feel like I've beaten the first 80% of most levels like 30 times each, to the point where there is zero challenge and fun for that section because every jump becomes memorized up to the point where I'm having trouble. As someone who also beat every level in Super Meat Boy, I think SMB handles level length much better.\n\n-Many (perhaps most?) deaths are from trial and error. A major flaw of 1001 Spikes here is that there's no way to safely play a level the first time even if you're patient and alert like other platformers allow. Rushing through will kill you somewhere for sure, but equally often playing it safe after every jump will kill you because you're often standing on a spike trap or falling rock. Keeping one or the other type of death consistent throughout an entire level would be better design IMO.","June 24, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
