I became a father eleven months ago. My partner, the mother of our daughter, saw me reading about 'That Dragon, Cancer' last month and asked what it was about. When I told her, she looked stunned and asked: 'Why would anyone want to play that?' I had no answer for her, but just knew that I did want to play it. Now that I have, I think I know why, and why I recommend it.\n\nThe death of a loved one is painful and traumatic. We cope with it as best we can; which is to say we utterly fail to cope with it, but try to go on living. I hope never to experience what the Greens went through, watching their son Joel dying, but admire their strength and courage in facing that experience and trying to make something positive of it. For me, the revulsion people feel about the notion of 'playing' this 'game' (I'll admit the words really don't fit) is a shamefully cowardly response - at the end of the day, we can hit Quit, and nothing has changed in our livess. The Greens lived this and did their best to process and communicate it. That's what art is all about, and shying away from it just because it makes us uncomfortable is symptomatic only of our own weakness, our insistence on an artificial safe-zone.\n\nAs a card-carrying atheist, I'm on a polar extreme away from the faith the Greens have, but I still found every moment of this episodic narrative driven audio-visual experience utterly relatable and overwhelmingly human. That's no mean feat, and speaks volumes of the honesty, the sheer soul-bearing earnestness that's gone into this harrowing project. I'll grant that the visuals may not be to everyone's tastes, the thematic examination of faith may be too cerebral for some, and the fundamentally morbid subject matter (but no - this is a celebration of a life, along with all the agony of its too-soon death) will put many off; but accusations of profiteering from their son's death can only sit somewhere on a spectrum between flat-out trolling and plain ignorance. If you sit somewhere toward the latter end, I urge you to play the game and experience it. It won't be much fun, but it will be worthwhile. As for the trolls, I hope they find some happiness on their own.","January 15","true","3.4"," 615 of 670 people (92%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","92","615","670","8","26"

I heard the movie UP was supposed to be a tear jerker but it really didn't phase me.  That Dragon, Cancer... well, this game is a different story.  Simply put, this is the most emotional game I've ever played.  I knew the game was only around 2 hours long, and I originally had plans to play another game I recently got immediately after finishing this one, but by the time I finished this game the only thing I wanted to do was pick up my baby boy and hold him tight.\n\nI imagine this game will be more powerful for those who have kids, and I imagine it may even be TOO powerful for those who have had kids with terminal illness or have otherwise lost their children at a young age.\n\nIn this game you essentially get a glimpse of what a real family went through with their son, from finding a tumor to hearing the news that chemotherapy had failed and that their son would die within months.  You feel for the parents as they experience a wide range of emotions from sadness, anger, despair, doubt, hope, peace and faith.\n\nYes, the game has strong religious messages within, but I don't feel this should detract from the game even if you aren't a believer, because this is the real life story of a real family and what they went through, and that includes their faith, their doubts, etc.  Regardless of whether you believe in God or not, you can still relate to these parents' grief and come away with something.\n\nAs a cessationistic Christian, I appreciated the fact that this wasn't some implausible story of a boy being miraculously healed or even raised from the dead.  It showed that the parents desperately wished for those things to occur and prayed for them to occur and hoped that they would occur, but ultimately rested in God's wisdom and that He does all things for His glory with the joyful reminder that one day they will see their child again in Heaven.","January 27","true","3.4"," 163 of 177 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","163","177","5","4"

The trailer should give you the right amount of information to know what's going on. With that said, the vulnerability and honesty presented in this game is more abundant than any work, game or otherwise, that I've ever encountered. There are no pulled punches, and yet the end result (for me, at least) is a feeling of hope, not despair.\n\nThe sound carries most of the narrative weight, allowing those involved in the story to tell it from their hearts, with the abstract graphics removing any risk of distracting by the false facial expressions and out-of-place animations so common in games, and instead focusing on broad strokes of color and texture.\n\nThis game carries such a powerful story and presents it so well that I consider it a must-play. I believe that you will, too.\n\n(EDIT: Since I've had to delete more than a few comments from readers that misread the opening line: I do not mean for you to infer that gamers are not human beings. Rather, the scope of this game encompasses broader themes than can be tackled solely from a gamer's perspective. I wished to specify that this game, unlike most others, does not thrive on its mechanics or graphics, but on the human connection it creates through the gameplay.)","January 12","true","5.5"," 621 of 773 people (80%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","80","621","773","52","33"

To those wondering about complaining about the price or the length: movies cost a hell of a lot more and have a lot less impact. If you're wondering about the folks outright critizing the game without even playing it or saying it should have never been on Steam to begin with, and somehow dragging the quality of Steam down: remind yourself that the internet is filled with the absolute worst people that ever roamed the fact of the earth.\n\nThe long part... Talking about gameplay or graphics seems like a hollow exercise for a game like this. For the uninitiated, the game consists of point and click vignettes chroicling the Green family's struggle through their son Joel's battle with cancer. I was surprised at the tone, as I really expected a big sadfest from start to finish. The game takes surprising turns, though, with very happy memories, along with the sad ones. The game explores a number of themes, including crises of faith, grief & loss, strength in adversity, and the struggle for normalcy.\n\nTo address the elephant in the living room, the topic of faith (especially that of Christian faith) is very present throughout the game, but really only in the context of how the Greens feel, and not once did the game feel preachy. It's a delicate balance that's well maintained.  The game feels extremely genuine, with very personal topics the Greens went through laid bare, including marital strife as a result of Joel's cancer. Throughout the game, you'll vire the events through different perspectives, including Joel's.\n\nThe art direction is superb, with different pieces of the narrative popping in once you look away from an item on screen and look back. The sound design is equally well done; the music through the game is varied and always appropriate.\n\nThis game was one of the most difficult games I've ever played, As a parent, I constantly projected my own kids into my perception of events, and it made it all the more difficult. The tone of the game, however, isn't one of blatant misery, but really a very pensive reflection of how this particular family dealt with tragedy, and as such, can be appreciated by those without kids. The game leaves plenty of room for reflection and interpretation, and I'm sure there will be hundreds of different opinions on what different points in the narrative mean.\n\nThe Greens (and the rest of the dev team) have created a thoughtful narrative that must have been very difficult to make, and those of us who play it, quite frankly, are going to be better for it. The game is short, but the impact of the narrative is felt deeply. Do yourself a favor - play this game, do so without preconceptions, and allow yourself to appreciate the experience.","January 13","true","1.6"," 243 of 321 people (76%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","76","243","321","13","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/exofreeze/recommended/419460/","exofreeze","eXoFreeze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/exofreeze/","1243 products in account","The game is amazing in many ways. There are moments when the Greens did an amazing job of capturing the frustration, self doubt, and myriad of emotions that one goes through during an experience such as this.\n\nIt felt *real*. And up until about the halfway point in the game it felt like one of the *realest* experiences I've ever played through.\n\nThat was until the Greens, specifically Amy, began to use religion as a crutch. While this is obviously their story, and it would have not served them well to leave out the ways they coped, for me I could not relate to these parts. I found myself cringing at every piece of narrative that invoked God or Jesus, and there are times when the scenes are, nearly literally, drowning in these references.\n\nAt this point I realized the story was less about Joel and more about their struggle with their faith. Admittedly, I felt as though there was a bit of bait and switch and play here. And I found myself sad for what the game could have been versus what it actually is.\n\nI'm not suggesting the game should be different. I'm simply disappointed that something that was so emotional suddenly took a sharp left into territory I could no longer relate to. Something that dealt with the fear and terror of loosing a child that doesn't begin to rationalize it all away by invoking heaven and God's plans, etc... would have been much more relate-able to me.\n\nWhile the Green's faith is obviously real to them... to someone on the outside it really felt like more of a delusion. Their anger at God for taking their son quickly turns to the tried and true mantras of "just have faith" and "God know's best". Going so far as to have the player go through a story of Jesus and his disciples rowing a boat across a lake in a storm.\n\nI don't fault Ryan and Amy Green for their faith, or even for implementing their faith into the game. This is their story and I'm glad they have decided to share it. But I do feel that people who don't share their faith should be aware of exactly where this story is heading. It can be quite a shock to go from a scene where I am crying due to how well they invoke the frustration of a child you can not heal to feeling uncomfortable as I listen to another conversation where Amy professes her blind faith that Joel will be OK.\n\nThat said, I don't regret my play through. I simply regret that a universal story of loss and grief becomes niche and is no longer relate-able to many non Christians by the second half. In many ways it was an amazing game.... it just wasn't a game for me.\n\nThe gameplay itself can be quite frustrating as well sometimes. There are no choices in the game, you simply move forward and let the story unfold. It is possible to get stuck if you don't go the right direction. Other times the player gets stuck on purpose, as Ryan designed certain sections to be frustrating to mirror his own frustrations. Unfortunately the lack of context clues can either be seen as clever or poor design. It all depends on how patient the player is. Anyone would be hard pressed to call the controls anything but clunky, however the controls don't necessarily need to be smooth in a narrative like this. Ultimately, if you choose to play this game, don't expect a challenge, don' expect smooth controls, do expect to move slowly through the game, and be prepared for a faith heavy last half.\n\nedit:\nA continual misinterpretation with my review was that I was offended by the faith in the game, when I feel that I was pretty clear that I simply could not relate to it. The assumption that faith is universal, and therefor all people should be able to play this game and relate to it is completely ignorant. Faith is no more universal than any other belief.\n\nTo be clear here, had the game ended with aliens abducting Joel, I would not have been able to relate to that either. Had the game ended with Joel suddenly gaining mutant super powers, destroying cancer, and then flying to the center of the earth to procure a cure for all cancer patients, then again, I would not have been able to relate to this either.\n\nThe best parts of the game were the REAL ones. The frustrating night(s), the memories, the moments of just Joel and his parents, the final prognosis.... These parts of the game were absolutely fantastic. They are universal because human suffering is universal. You don't have to have lost a child to sympathize with the pain the Green's describe in these sections.\n\nRyan actually has one of the best lines in the game. Near the end Amy is apologizing to him for being upset that they took different routes through grief to arrive at the same place. And she wraps up by saying, "But at least we both know Joel will be ok." Ryan responds, "I don't.". Amy asks, "You don't what?" And Ryan finishes by saying, "I don't know that he will be ok. I hope he will... but I don't know that he will."\n\nThat is the "delusion" I was speaking of. The delusion of believing he will be ok no matter what the doctor says, no matter how far Joel deteriorates, and no matter how harsh reality is. And Ryan has lucid moments during those times where he questions these things, but ultimately, Joel's death is too much for him and he rushes back to his faith for that final comfort. As I said originally, I do not fault the Green's for their faith. I would never ask them to change this game. It is their experience. But to say that I, or anyone/everyone else should be able to relate to this experience is absolutely ignorant. If I were to design a game that dealt with the loss of a loved one with zero with zero faith, or even overt denials of faith, then would it be realistic for me to blindly state that everyone should be able to relate to my point of view? Not at all.","January 13","false","2.9"," 2,885 of 4,175 people (69%) found this review helpful 86 people found this review funny","69","885","4","86","296"

Tragedy.\n\nTwo words that have ended as synonymous far more often than anyone cares to remember. Cancer and other terminal illnesses are something that almost all of us have been touched by in some way. Whether it be from a person very close to us, ourselves, or just someone that has influenced us in some way. If it hasn't, odds are it will at some point in your life. These diseases invariably impact us in a negative and tragic way. We have experienced loss due to them and watched others suffer unimaginable pain trying to survive and fight to stay alive.\n\nAt the same time there is defintiely something else that comes from experiences of dealing with ternminal illness. While contemplating the losses that are sure to come, one can't help but think of all the ways we discover the true value of beauty, life, and love as it is slipping away. Our senses to these feelings become more acute. We realize what matters to us. What we would really miss if we weren't here. We contemplate wasted time and struggle to determine what is actually valuable and worthwhile while we have such a short time to experience life.\n\nAs we look back on those we lost we understand that these people are part of human history. Everyone has their own story. We wonder if we may have an impact that can be somewhat immortal after we are gone by making sure we do something that will be remembered. Is this what matters for a life? Is it impacting others in a way that makes them remember us, or is that not really what is important? Is it important to just give as much as we can while we are here to help others, regardless of how long we are remembered, or do we have a duty to leave something behind that lasts well beyond or time on Earth?\n\nThose that deal with terminal illnesses where they have a sense of not just how they will die, but roughly when they will die are more likely to contemplate these things I reckon. I know watching someone I care about dying from such an illness makes me think about these things, and how much time I waste on things I deem to be pointless. A story like this makes me think about all these same things.\n\n'That Dragon, Cancer' is a true story about a very small boy that gets cancer when he is only a couple years old. We listen to the voices of his parents, siblings, and of the boy as he fights cancer. We hear the inner dialogues that his parents have with themselves. How distraught they feel, how scared they are, how helpless they feel about it. We also see how they use faith in "God" to help them through it. One parent has almost no doubts about their faith, while the other questions it in many ways.\n\nAs a player we can feel an enormous amount of sorrow while playing through it. We know that everyone involved is dealing with cancer on a daily basis and their lives are in a struggle fighting "That dragon, cancer" as it is described. The game is broken into several sections in which we see random blocky sort of graphics in an abstract style. There isn't much in the form of mechanics other than clicking on objects to move the world around and get more commentary. IT is a "walking simulator". Many of the scenes we hear are live voice acting that I have to assume are either re-enacted, or were saved through video, or recordings when they happened originally. We hear the parents talking to the kids and sharing normal daily moments like singing lullabyes before bedtime, their sons laughing and joking, and many many instances of their son Joel, who has the illness, laughing. (I am guessing this is really him, but I have no idea). It really gives us the feeling of what they are going through and we feel like we are getting to know them as real people.\n\nWe aren't just getting voices form the family, however. As we walk through hospital halls we are able to see some real life artworks from cancer patients and dozens of personal notes, which I assume are those that have come together for the project, or met the developer and family through their own battles with cancer. These are displayed as greeting cards all over tables and hanging on walls throughout hospital rooms during certain sections. Must be at least 100 of these and I read every single one of them, which is why my playtime is higher than most. Some were survivors, some are just positive messages to go on, and some are memorials to those that have lost the fight. Many of which are small children that makes your heart ache that much more. Also, we have personal letters that are read with voice acting in other scenes about the experiences some have had as well.\n\nWhile the major theme of this is dealing with cancer there is another significant theme throughout this game as well that deals with the parents' belief and faith in "God" (Christian God since they mention Jesus a few times). As a non-believer this is familiar as we live in a society that is mostly believers so it isn't anything new. What I found interesting here was that it was a great look into the mind of a believer in my eyes. It gives some insight into how they think, as well as a lot of examples of why they do believe, or can convince themselves to. While it may, or may not be intentional to give a counter-point, one of the two characters even has significant doubts and asks many logical questions that many non-believers once asked before they became non-believers. Yet, he does not. This gave me some thoughts of how much one can love a mate, or they have such fears of being alone and losing a mate, that they may simply lie to them, or themselves about belief like this to placate a wife/husband, or to stay together due to a possible breaking of the family. I am sure many believers hide their non-belief due to the possible consequences of being found out. I won't stay on this topic any longer, but belief in a higher power definitely has a significant role in this game. I think most can expect that from a story that portrays a tremendous loss such as a child trying to find answers. This is THEIR story, and they are believers so of course it covers these themes. They aren't writing about me after all.\n\nOverall, the game absolutely should make you cry. If you are in the right mindset and feel like playing such a game then by all means do I recommend it. I don't think rating this game makes sense, or trying to say buy it on sale, or not. If you can relate to, or want to you will play it eventually.  I suggest that you try to immerse yourself into it philosophically as well as emotionally to get as much as you can out of it too. Read all the cards you see, view all the artwork, etc. These all gave me a lot of thoughts about just how important a single person can be to others, and how significant their lives are to the meaning of someone else's. Just how many histories there are out there that deal with this type of loss. It made me want to hug someone I cared about today and let them know that I love them, and that I am glad I have the chance to know them.\n\nTake care. :)","January 29","true","4.3"," 70 of 77 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","70","77","2","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ExcitingJeff/recommended/419460/","ExcitingJeff","Exciting Jeff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ExcitingJeff/","1107 products in account","Back when I was in college, and had more time to read video game blogs, there was a lot of talk about whether the industry could create games that could make people cry. Even then, the question seemed sort of off-base: of course games can make you cry. Black Isle had shut down, and Van Buren was caught in the… well, fallout. We’d all suffered corrupted save games, impossible boss battles, and game-destroying bugs in the era before widespread patching. I guess there was also that thing where Sepiroth killed some lady, and the whole world cried about that. Admittedly, I didn’t make it that far in FFVII.\n\nAnyway, the question of games evoking complex emotion was a bit silly then, and it’s ridiculous now. In the last few years, I’ve been devastated by more games than I can even count. I place the advent of games routinely making me feel awful somewhere around the release of Spec Ops: The Line, but developers have really ramped up the emotional resonance in the past few years. Games like To the Moon, Gone Home, Actual Sunlight, and Life Is Strange serve all delivery tear-inducing gut punches. Even Telltale’s Walking Dead earned a good cry; I can’t remember, but I think even their Game of Thrones made me tear up a little bit. The medium has grown up, despite the tantrums thrown by some Peter Pan “gamers” desperate to avoid such a fate.\n\nThe question is no longer “can games make us cry?” The answer is a resounding “yes.” The question, it seems, has grown more specific, and yet more diffuse. The medium now poses a series of distinct but interrelated questions, but I’ll start with the easy one: can a game make us cry from beginning to end?\n\nThat brings me to my topic, That Dragon, Cancer: the short, true, and intensely personal story of pediatric cancer and its effects on the Green family, who both suffered through the prolonged illness of their son Joel and then found the strength to make a video game about it. The answer to the question, by the way, is “yes.” And the first of many corollaries is “do we WANT a game that emotionally exhausting?”\n\nMy answer is a qualified “yes,” by which I mean “yes, I wanted this thing to exist, and yes, I think that it’s a worthwhile experiment that moves the medium forward.” I also mean “yes, I reluctantly Kickstarted this game, not so much because I wanted the experience  it offered but because I wanted the experience to be available,” and “yes, when I had a quiet evening to myself, I turned off the lights and did what I was dreading for several weeks after getting my Steam key: I played the game.”\n\nAm I glad I played it? Yes. An unqualified yes. The game, with its meditative pace, its simple but thoughtful audiovisual configuration, and its unflinching emotional sincerity, is beautiful and harrowing. And it raised a whole crop of questions I didn’t even know I was curious about.\n\nCan a game make me feel paternal? Apparently, it can, much to my surprise. I have no wish to have children; aside from the massive time commitment that I struggle to even comprehend, I’ve always feared passing on my anxieties and neuroses to another generation, continuing the tradition of my mother, and her mother before her. I’ve never seen the allure of parenting, and I’ve never thought I’d be particularly good at it. Yet something about the Greens’ story, wherein they struggle to extract the moments of joy from the short time they have to share with Joel, sometimes succeeding and often failing, made me think that maybe I could handle it. Sure, I was just playing a game, and while the game is remarkably effective and engendering empathy, I didn’t really have to deal with the horror of losing a son.\n\nBut the game played a trick on me. While I was experiencing the story and chewing the scenery, I wanted it to end. I didn’t want to suffer anymore; I was tired of crying. The game is painful. But I knew that this was my one experience with the game. I knew that I would never come back this way again. It was too painful. Throughout my play, I was acutely aware that any snippet of experience I missed this time would be lost to me forever. So I took my time. I tried to hold it all inside me; the sounds, the notes, the hope for a miracle. I read all the cards I could handle reading (Can a Kickstarter reward tier make you cry? Yes). I treasured it all, even as it hurt me. I wanted to finish my experience, but I was also watching Steam notifications telling me that my friends were playing Skyrim or Her Story, and I wanted to know when I could stop and do normal things like they were. I could feel, in my own small way, the desperation the Greens felt, simultaneously hoping for the end while savoring the moment, wishing for a miracle the whole time.\n\nRight. So there’s the miracle stuff. And the God stuff. There’s a lot of God stuff. The Greens are believers. I’m not. So I struggled with another question: “What do I do with all this faith, when I firmly believe in a materialist existence that ends with death?” I take it, and despite myself, I ruminate on the mysteries of grace. Obviously, I don’t begrudge the Greens their faith, especially in a time of crisis. Like the game, the faith the Greens rely on is simple and beautiful, not pushy. It’s the faith of Job, and while it doesn’t give me solace, I do understand it. In that sense, That Dragon, Cancer is perhaps the most effective Christian game I’ve ever come across. It doesn’t attempt to proselytize, but it spreads the gospel in a way Left Behind or Super Bible Trivia or whatever could never hope for, because the Greens’ faith is based on hope, and love shines through the biblical platitudes that would make me roll my eyes in any other context. That’s the sort of faith I could stand to see more, and removing it from the game would make the whole experience lose its authenticity and its immediacy. My preferences aren’t germane.\n\nAnyway, the game isn’t perfect. The controls can be clunky. There’s one spot where a bug forced me to restart a scene multiple times. In some scenes, there’s more to hear than there is to see. But these are niggling concerns. It’s tempting to dismiss them as the price of such a personal experience, but instead, I’ll say that they don’t matter.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/419460/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","This is the story of Joel. This brave hero was a young kid that had to fight a very very big bad dragon going by the name of Cancer. And Cancer had also a huge impact on his parents and family. From trying to make him smile by playing with him to keep him company in a place where doctors are trying to cure and defeat Cancer, Joel will never be alone.\n\nAnd what Joel doesn't know is the phone calls between his daddy and mommy, their thoughts during grow-up talks, their darkest moments but also their unwaiving love and faith. And besides, for Joel, when he goes home, it's like a giant Super Mario Kart's party. When there is a story to tell, he's the brave knight. And Joel isn't alone. Daddy is there to give him hugs, mommy is singing.\n\nBut That Dragon, Cancer is also a tribute to those who survived Cancer and those who died and remembered fondly by their family. True, you'll cry. Joel is playing, you stop and he's not here anymore. You read cards and letters from survivors and family having lost a dear one and you're torn between hope and sadness.\n\nThe only thing you can do is to walk, to explore, to read and listen to Joel's parents thoughts, whether it's filled with life or filled with anger/sadness/depression. You play. The only thing that matters is to listen to Joel (or anyone voicing him, because Joel was mute because of Cancer) and to make him laugh. That's your goal. Care for him. Anyone knowing the history behind the game knows the end.\n\nAnd the game is so colorful and so dark by moments. But always filled with hope. Love. Faith because God is mentionned a lot as the family is believing in Him. You can be from any religion, from any belief, even the atheist one, you'll be touched.\n\nPlaying that game is paying a tribute to everyone who lost againt Cancer, to everyone that pinned down Cancer so Cancer leaves them alone, to everyone that saw Cancer attacking their loved one and that were feeling so powerless that the only thing they could do was caring, holding an hand, crying and mainly giving so much love so that their loved one don't feel alone or unloved, to keep at bay the darkness, to try to find the light when the darkness is too much...\n\nThis game is also a way to find life again for the Green family. Everyone have to find a way to live after loosing someone to Cancer. I've a story family with: my great-grandfather, my great-grandmother and my grandmother died of that sickness. I'm at risk as it's one of these cancers that could be genetical (you know, ovaries, breasts, etc...). Even the game isn't representing what I lived as a family member, not that I was too young, but because I had my own problems at the time, I still remember the day I've learned about it. I still remember the day my grandmother couldn't walk anymore, couldn't eat anymore, staying in an hospital bed. I still remember the ER, the hospital room, the wig (we laughed about it because she had the same haircut as me)...\n\nI don't care if I didn't really review this game, though I've said what I would say normally in other words. I tend to write in that style when emotional,  like I was inventing a novel or making philosophical texts.\n\nAnd if anything, that game deserves the best I can write.","January 13","true","3.1"," 201 of 273 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","201","273","7","1"

I cried.\n\nI sometimes got frustrated with the controls.\n\nBut overall, I really admired what this game is grappling with, sometimes very successfully, sometimes less so. If you're interested in experimental narrative games like Thirty Flights of Loving or The Beginner's Guide, you won't regret picking this game up. Just make sure you approach it in a receptive mood with some extra patience for awkward controls. I would also try not to look too much into the reporting around the game and just play it for what it is first.\n\nAs a non-religious person, not yet a parent, and lucky enough never to have lost anyone close to me to cancer, I could seem like the worst possible audience for this game. However, I actually feel like this game taught me a lot, and that it has helped prepare me for a part of life that we will all have to deal with one day. I can picture myself sitting in a hospital room years or decades from now and thinking back to the raw--but beautiful--imagery of this game and the deep questions that it asks. This is a gift that I will carry with me always. This is what experiential narrative games can be.\n\nAfter reading more about the family and the making of the game itself, I wished that TD,C had gone into more detail about Amy and Ryan as a couple. Amy originally seemed convinced that Joel's miraculous recovery would inspire others in their Christianity, and as that dream slowly fades, I wanted to know more about the impact that had on their faith and their relationship.\n\nBut I can understand why the developers shifted gears to making the game more of a memorial to Joel, when it started out as a game more focused on the impact Joel's cancer had on his parents. Joel only recently passed away. Amy and Ryan agree in-game that "we ended up in the same place," in terms of their faith, but as a player things felt more fragile. This is a game very much written "from the trenches" of loss and pain, rather than from the typical distance that developers are able to take from these issues. I think that is what makes this game so unique. Its immediacy and lack of distance can be jarring, and as a player, even one who typically plays narrative games, it can be hard to know how to react.\n\nAt the beginning of this review, when I said I laughed while playing this game, I meant it. I laughed hard at Joe's giggle, at the antics of Joel's siblings and at his parents' witty frustration with "cancer culture." I also mourned, brutally, for the loss at the center of this game. As the game says at one point--and I'm not sure about the exact quote--living through cancer, just like living through life, is "all the things"--happiness, joy, sadness, skepticism, sarcasm, irritation, love, and again, so much joy.\n\nThank you to Ryan and Amy Green for sharing your experience with us.

Playing this game was a very emotional experience for me.\n\nGames like this are tough to review. The emotional power makes us feel like we only have two options:\n\n1. Marvel in the astonishing transcendent beauty of this family's pain, elegantly channelled into this work of art, a testament not only to their own loss but the loss of the millions of others who have walked the same path; or\n\n2. Be a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe heartbreaking emotional texture of this "game" obliterates simplistic evaluation criteria, making the common vocabulary of game reviews like "fun" and "objectives" (and even the word "game" itself) obsolete. That said, it's not fair to say that because we all instantly respect the creator and his family, and have compassion for their pain, we therefore cannot react in any way negatively to the craft of this work.\n\nSome of the mechanical elements are maddening -- why must we click three times before we can see a fully-lit work of art, for example? I understand that some of these elements are intentionally maddening; I heard some spoilers on the Radiolab podcast before I played the game, so I knew what was coming in several scenes. I understand that the player is supposed to feel powerless and confused at times. But there is a vital distinction between the desired emotional impressionism (player feels angry because that's what the father felt at that moment) on the one hand, and frustrating gaming experience due to sub-optimal mechanical implementation (a different way of moving around would be more fluid and accessible) on the other. I can't get more specific without spoilers, so I'll leave it here.\n\nThese criticisms -- which I'm sure some will ascribe to mere nit-picking on my part; that's okay, I'm used to it -- reflect my admiration for everything this "game" is, and how desperately I wish it were perfect. So it goes.\n\nRegardless of these problems, however, "That Dragon Cancer" is a remarkable achievement, providing a shockingly intimate glimpse into the souls of a family slogging through the unimaginable. (While watching my father die was painful, and I felt many specific moments of contact with the journey of Joel's family, there's obviously a unique sort of horror that comes with losing one's child.)\n\nThe music, the use of text on the walls, and -- especially -- the cards that become tiny windows into the vast galaxies of pain endured by so many others: These things really do make the "game" transcendant and beautiful. It's obviously not a fun experience (because it's not supposed to be), but it's absolutely worthwhile and well-made.\n\nMy own pantheist cosmology puts me at odds with some of the Christian overtones here, but opens me up to others. I guess the greatest victory a religious video game can claim is to touch the infinite without obviating alternative faiths. TDC succeeds admirably here, even if a few moments had me gnashing my teeth. The metaphors and iconography aren't exactly subtle, but they are compelling and thorough.\n\nIn case you can't tell, I strongly recommend this game. It's not perfect, but it is nevertheless magnificent.","January 30","true","1.9"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","30","33","0","3"

Far too heavy to really write about. One has to approach a project like this with a certain degree of carefulness as to not pinch a nerve. It's a short experience, game, call it whatever – it is not of interest, it is not appropriate to consider – but it has a lot of talking points. Themes run through this game in a very condensed manner, through minimalist artistry and an ambient atmosphere soundscape sharply conveyed in tandem with the subject matter. As most games tend to some extent be grand and impersonal, with an amount of graphical detail that That Dragon, Cancer cannot match, few games come close to the intimacy of this game. Even with facelessness there is character, and the voice acting portrays the countenance of despair better than any animation could. Here we are not shown a narrative on a grand scale, instead the focal point runs inward, towards the core family dynamic in the process of losing one of its members, and it hurts.\n\nWhat one could call levels in other games are perhaps best put as scenes in That Dragon, Cancer. The player, or observer, inhabits the bird's eye view, although quite literally which does not fit with the term “bird's eye view”. One is loaded into a scene of varying degree of bizarreness depending on whether or not it's in a symbolic realm or in a scene attempting to, with a minimalist impressionist style, capture a memory as is. While the game, I assume, tries to mix up the somberness of this very dire subject matter with some depictions of joyous memories, I found the merriment to be most gut-wrenching. Before death, that which negates the positive experience of joy, I feel the diminishing of each such moment to no longer be a fight, a hopefulness or an alignment with God, but a mirror to the great negator. A mirror situated before the face of death. God is the great escape. As the knight in Seventh Seal puts it:  We must make an idol of our fear, and that idol we shall call God.\n\nPerhaps in this intimate setting, where we follow a family in their dealings with death, the religious experience, or where faith becomes a supplement for knowledge, we find the grandness that perhaps did not belong. When tragedy is belied, misconstrued as a test of faith, or when the symbolic obfuscation of the true object of fear creates an “out”, we no longer find intimacy, we find absolute oblivion. Any form of true interaction between humans is interchanged with an ersatz of divine comfort. And this escape, which is portrayed in this game to the nth degree, is what is most forlorn in the face of death. Because once, if, let's say, as a thought experiment, we do not capitulate to the grace of God, what then? What comfort is there in our pain? If our pain is insignificant for the other, especially for the big Other. The game alludes to the troubles of flatus vocis, a category wherein God belongs at least to me, but to the game, to this family, it is a trouble of the weakness of platitudes. What are words compared to the suffering of this child? Of the people who love this child? What are words in comparison to the actual death of flesh that we are all facing. I cannot begrudge the plead for something that would calcify our significance in this world, perhaps especially our departing from it, that death should have significance for it to not ruin us. My issue is only with the ease of which one disappears from the horror of natural life, from our lifeworld/lebenswelt by way of God or any sort of deus ex machina for the despairing narrative of our subjects.\n\nNo matter what your religious leanings or non-leanings may be, there is immense beauty encapsulated in this experience. I was brought out of the experience once due to a somewhat silent and weird bubble-blowing scene that was a bit too long for its emotional impact, but that might also just have been my own disregard for the religious detour and its beauty. Other than this incidence, most of it hits you hard. You know it is real and it hits you hard. The visuals are as stated before, minimalist, but vibrant and oddly enough fits perfectly with the idea of this being a looking-back, a memory not vividly there. It is not being lived, it is a reliving with everything fitting that oneiric haze of a memory. There is a lot of imagery that fits with this existential depth one falls into when dealing with death, there is the clichéd cosmic indifference that come with 1900th century scientism and the subsequent dehiscence between man and faith, all adding to the effect that introspection already should have had on you.\n\nMusically there is a similar finesse to every scene. Noise, drone and ambiance when focus is on something else, where the soundscape is tailor made to enhance a visual or a voice actor's performance, and silent sections with a more instrumental punch where the music speaks for itself. There is an elegance to the production of this game, an understanding of what is at hand here in terms of themes and portrayal of something very close to many people, especially themselves.\n\nEverything in That Dragon, Cancer has been made with so much care. Obviously with a game like this you cannot haphazardly throw something together, you can't make it cynical, you cannot fail in any regard whatsoever for to do so would be to squander an opportunity for a heart-wrenchingly personal game that I'm sure resonate deeply with a lot of people. I sincerely do not think anything here is a failure. This game is a depiction of both the process of dying and death, of being an other, being “here” while that somebody is “there”, being helpless, falling victim to the unknown and the desperation it brings out in people; and it was effective. Nothing about this is easy. I don't think it ever will be, or ever should be. However, I do think it is important. I think it's important to know, to encroach on this otherwise very personal story through this medium. Moreover, I think it's important to know what you cannot know. I think it's important being able to feel “this”, and letting others deal with that in whatever way they see fit. To feel the lack of the unknown, to feel the negation of life, and to be an observer of the onerous path towards it, both physically and mentally.\n\nThere is a lot more to say, a lot more to discover and think about, a lot more to feel. Succinctly put: I'd recommend you just play it and find out by yourself.

However, I assure you that I am not coming from a place of ill-intent; I am merely being honest with my own personal experience.\n\nThat being said, this is a woefully earnest tale of faith, love, and loss. It presents these mournful concepts with symbolic, and sometimes straightforward minigames that will make you feel something bittersweet. The dialogue is beautifully poetic and somber, and the dramatic impact is futher reinforced by wonderful music and superb vocal performances.\n\nHowever, although it feels pointless to gripe about the mechanical aspects of this title, I have to be honest; the interface is particularly clunky in its restrictive way of navigating the environments and story. I understand that it is a narrative experience more than a traditional game, but I felt that it should be addressed. I was genuniely engaged and wanted to see more, but more often than not, general navigation and interaction was a chore.\n\nAlso, as a warning to those with adverse reactions to the mere mention of religion, this title has prevalent and reoccuring themes of faith that may alienate some players. During these particular segments I personally found it difficult to empathize fully with the game, although I still wholeheartedly understood and sympathized.\n\nIn conclusion, "That Dragon, Cancer" is beautiful, but not for everyone. Althought I could not connect with it as much as I had hoped, I am genuinely glad that something like that exists in the medium, even if it wasn't particularly made for me.

There's no other way to put it. The degree this game affects you can vary depending your feelings on very personal subjects (religion, in particular) but, at the end of the day, this is a heavy, very human, very interesting game.\n\nEssentially, this is a mechanically simple point-and-click game. While the player may be distracted by the myriad vistas it has to offer, the path the player must go through to progress is plainly laid out. The style of graphics (a kind of Out of This World-style polygonal format) follows suit with the simplicity of the controls, and does more to attract the player to the story, rather than take away from it. What really matters in That Dragon, Cancer, though, is the writing.\n\nRyan Green's prose is purely sincere, and this sincerity shines through in its range of complexity. At times, he will quote and create passages that would fit well in any poem but, in darker moments, he will discard all pretension and lay out his bare feelings. In either instance, it is always easy to understand his level of distress, anger, fear, despair, and hope each time he speaks. If I had to pick an excellent sample of his writing, I'd choose the following statement he makes near the beginning, presumably speaking of cancer itself:\n\n"Fear is cancer's preservative. Cancer's embalming oil. And you, oh Accuser, are fear's oil salesman. You're a snake. A serpent. A dragon with snuffed out coal on his breath. Molting, talons broken from the struggle to free yourself of your own skin."\n\nWhile it's an excellent bit of writing in itself, the accompanying reading by Ryan hammers home the bitter, personal hatred he has for the disease. It's the combination of writing and voice acting that really kept me hooked, and hearing Ryan emote was just as meaningful, if not more so, than any image provided.\n\nIf there was to be any criticism in my experience with this game, it would be that it's...disjointed. It feels like the game was made when this tragedy was ongoing, which makes it a bit difficult to follow as far as what point in this all the chapters take place. On the other hand, this does give a more raw feel to the whole game, making it seem more like these chapters were made in the moment, rather than a recollection. Still, this can be a bit troubling when trying to follow a timeline.\n\nIn summary: this game was not entertaining. It was not fun. However, I can say with full confidence that this was engaging.

The story (about two hours long) is divided into several scenes of two types - the real descriptive scenes, and spiritual/metaphoric scenes about hope.\n\nWhat I really loved about the game were the scenes showing the real events from mixed point of views - the game is directed to play a lot with the camera point of views. Those are also the scenes that felt immersive and can easily wake the emotions, e.g. talking with the doctor about Joel's cancer for the first time.\n\nThe other type of scenes is more used near the end and I'm more puzzled about that, as I found actually annoying to hear about Jesus and hope in almost every moment; though I must admit it perfectly fits into the characters without doubt. Besides dialogues between the parents, you can (optionally) read many notes about other patients with cancer, and few long letters about Joel. All those important letters, and all dialogues, are voice-acted with the top quality - the voice acting will truly support your empathy towards the characters. You'll be hearing all the despair and sadness, mixed with hope; but what will be your final notion?\n\nPresentation of the game is simply great, as it has arty visual style that requires you to think of the visual metaphores' context. Besides that, it also provides you a lot of optional exploring in the gallery (great artworks and photos), or in the "spritual scenes" and the hospital, where all notes and letters are placed. Worth mentioning is also the great idea for subtitles - they aren't just a small text at the bottom of the screen, but they are placed directly into scenes, making even better impression.\n\nConclusion:If you don't mind games which are solely based around empathy for the story's characters, and you don't mind a depressive theme (child's cancer), you'll definitely enjoy this experience.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","April 13","true","1.9"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

However, about halfway in, this game becomes VERY focused on religion and faith. Some could (and do) argue that this is all part of the family's experience and is relevant to the story. While I do not think its fair to insult, criticise or question their beliefs - to each their own - I do think it is fair to inform those about to drop 10-15 dollars on this game. As someone who doesn't share their faith, I found this element (religion) quite alienating and prevented me from "connecting" with the characters and the story overall. As such, the powerful experience that was had by others, was kind of lost on me.\n\nThis has probably got a lot more to do with me than them, but I'm saying this now because none of the comments I read told me how much of a part this element (faith, religion) played, and had they mentioned it, I probably would not have bought this one.\n\nRegardless, my thoughts and condolences do go out to the family.","February 20","false","1.7"," 213 of 354 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","213","354","7","21"

But to be in that position, to experience something like that, that's something any form of art and medium can show. To have the player exploring those hardships, and the internal thoughts within them.\n\nThat's this game.\n\nPros:A emotional story that left me thinking\nSimplistic and Beautiful Artstyle with a nice emphasis on polygons\nMemorable setpieces\n\nThe presentation is stellar. The way dialogue is displayed is one of my most favorite things about the game.\nNitpicks:\nThe Point-n-Click interface feel off. It's not bad, it's functional, but the poor mouse acceleration and WASD set-up also being used to control the camera made the first few minutes of the game awkward to control.\nThe game has a beautiful soundtrack that unfortunately is not as memorable as the rest of the game. No particular tracks stand out. It's not bad though!\nSometimes the text doesn't become as visible due to something blocking in the way.Cons:The mini-games serve the game very well, but they're poorly done. They feel broken and stiff.The Review\nThis is That Dragon, Cancer. The game's scenes take you through a story about Joel Green, a young boy diagnosed with AT/RT cancer. The story faces a lot of ups and downs, with moments of hope and many of despair. What I feel like is sort of important to note is that despite cancer being a major subject in the game, it's not what the overall message really is about. It's a story about coping with death. The inevitability of it.\n\nI really like just how beautiful it is. It's polygon-bsaed artstyle is unique, it's set-pieces and locations are bizarre, and the way dialogue appears as if it was a typography is really cool. There's really nothing that's like this game in terms of presentation, and that's what makes it shine.\n\nThe game has a lot of themes regarding Christianity, and believing in faith. While I'm not really one to believe in a religion, I do think that it's part of what makes this game so interesting. I'm not a believer of Christ, I don't understand how saying something among the lines of "God will save me" or "God will heal me" will do anything in a situation like dying. But here, I understand, and that's something I really didn't expect from this game.\n\nMINOR SPOILERS\n\nWhat may be a drag in some cases are some of it's interactive elements. I'm OK with games like Gone Home and The Beginner's Guide, but the mouse sensitivity never seemed right for me in the first-person perspective. The interactive minigames, mainly in particular the Mario Kart-themed and Arcade minigames, didn't feel good to control. The Mario Kart minigame was enjoyable and hopeful from a story standpoint, but the controls were awkward and it felt stiff when the kart tried to turn. The arcade game was fine, and actually a cool highlight of the game, but the gameplay itself wasn't interesting. Maybe I'm being too harsh in what are mainly interactive bits from the story, because all of the minigames are fine, it's just those two in particular were the most unpolished aspects of the game.\n\nSometimes the dialogue is obscured due to certain cases (Such as in one chapter where it is being blocked by water)\n\nWhat I love a lot about this game is how personal it is. The developers of the game are actually Joel's parents, Amy and Ryan Green. It's really their commitment to make such a honorary tribute to their son that made this experience so memorable.\n\n\nTL;DR - A personal experience that nails it's premise on a artistic level. I appreciate and adore the fact that both Amy and Ryan Green were brave and strong enough to share their story, in something beautiful and so memorable. Definitely play.\nFor more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!","January 17","true","1.5"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","23","31","2","0"

I am a parent of a young daughter, and this game effected me greatly.  One of, if not the most, emotional games of the last 20 years.  It takes on a very serious subject matter (cancer), and really drives home the emotions associated with it for all parties involved.  Anyone who has known someone close going through cancer should play this game as a healing process in their minds.  I don't want to reveal too much about the plot line, but it's fantastic.  The art style is perfect.  Game control is great with either a controller or a keyboard and mouse combination.  Sound is all recorded in real world voices, and sounds.  If the end of this game doesn't effect you greatly, you aren't ♥♥♥♥ing human - period.  It's a four hours long game, and worth every second.  It plays like a movie or story unfolding.  Don't expect puzzles or any standard video game elements.  This is an interactive story that is needed to be told and understood by any mature person.  I hope you enjoy it, as much as my wife and I did.  Also this game made my daughter (1 year old) both laugh and cry.

Dependent on what you were looking for from this game, you will either be satisfied, or you won't be.\n\nLet’s start with what this game does well-\n- The way that this game captures emotions, and the way it depicts Joel in particular, is astonishing. Making Joel laugh, watching him play, it adds authenticity to an innocent child who is totally oblivious to the horrible reality of his future. The fact that the games events are directly tied to a true story, and the decision to include voice acting from many of the real people who lived it, gives this game a juggernaut of a narrative that cannot be matched by nearly any other narrative-driven game. For these reasons, this was the most tear-jerking game I have ever played.\n\nUnfortunately, there are many things that this game does wrong-\n- This game tried too many ambitious ideas that either completely fell flat, or were counter-intuitive and insulting to the whole point of the game. First and foremost, the decision to include bizarre mini-games such as the go-kart segment or the dragon "boss battle" segment (from which the game's name derives), were both unfortunate inclusion that distracted and dampened the emotional weight of the game. These were wonky, half- baked efforts to diversify the narrative that did more harm than good.\n- As a game, there's more bad news. There are numerous segments where it is not clear how to advance. This seems to have been done on purpose to force the player to become immersed and only worry about progression later on, but it actually has the opposite effect. It can lead to things like walking around aimlessly for extended periods of time, hearing the same lines of dialogue over and over again before you can figure out what you are actually supposed to do, or watching the same animations repeated over and over.\n- In addition, the decision to heavily emphasize Christian imagery and beliefs in the second half of the game was questionable. While this may have been a significant factor in the lives of the real people who dealt with these events, this creates issues in the context of a game, and it is for good reason that divisive issues like religion do not usually get included in video games. It dampens the impact of the narrative for people of differing religious beliefs, and, in the worst of cases, could offend some people.\n- And finally, there is the issue of length. This game does a lot in its short length, but a $15 game that you can beat in 1 to 2 hours is a weak bargain.\n\nFinal Verdict-\nYou may be wondering, if I had so much negative stuff to say about this game, why I still gave it a recommendation. This goes back to what I said earlier- everything depends on what you expect to get out of this game. If you expect a heart- wrenching narrative that explores the life of a young child and his family going through the ultimate test to their willpower, then you will definitely not be disappointed (I definitely was not disappointed personally). However, if you buy this game expecting anything more (a sizeable duration, diverse or engaging gameplay, etc.) you will be disappointed. Consider how important these things are to you before you make a decision about buying the game.","January 13","true","2.6"," 50 of 82 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","50","82","4","4"

The use of audio from home movies makes every bit of unscripted dialouge feel authentic and genuine. The faceless character models and simplistic graphics (which are absolutely beautiful in their own right) make sure that the story isn't washed over by flashy polygons or advanced shaders, allowing the player to truly connect with this family whom they've never known personally. The game is filled to the brim with clever metaphors,  one of my personal favorites being the go-cart segment in the hospital, where the laptime can be counted in years, and the race ending with the number of treatments and procedures Joey underwent during that time.\nThe game clocks in right around the 2 hour mark, maybe less if you zip right through without observing any of the content added to the game by the Kickstarter backers, but for me, that was just long enough. I think by making this game so extraordinarily short, sweet, and to the point, it makes it all that much more powerful.  Thank God I only had to watch Joel suffer for 2 hours, instead of the years his family had to watch.\nAll in all, this game was an absolute joy to play, and, because I ordered it through their website, a portion of my money goes to assist childhood cancer research, which I couldn't be more happy about.","January 17","true","1.8"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","21","31","0","0"

The game is by no means a bad game, and there are certain people I would recommend it to. So lemme start off with the things that drew me to it in the first place and what I did like about the game.\n\nFirst off, the aesthetic is just plain beautiful. It is almost like an impressionist painting, just the way no colors are blended and the people within are close approximations of humans. It is a great game to look at no doubt. The voice acting is top notch, due in large part that the voices are given by the family that had to endure this tragedy. The fact that this family just lost their young son to cancer and were then able to create nearly every facet of the game on their own truly is a feat not many could pull off. I love narrative driven "walking simulators" so when a new one with a unique look, superb acting, and a real world story of loss came on my radar, I was very intrigued.\n\nThis leads to the reason I am thumbing it down. I was on board with the tragic elements that were unfolding, when suddenly that was all undermined with a literal deus ex machina entering the story. We all process grief in different ways, so while I respect the Green family's turn to God, I couldn't help but feel completely disconnected from the game. I am not a religious person at all, but even looking at this story objectively, they were clearly going for an emotional aspect. If you then swoop in and remind the player that "Hey, its cool guys, we believe in God and this is God's plan for our kid to die," then you rob everyone of the emotional attachment they had. For me the tragedy moved to the Green's themselves, I couldn't help but think these poor people really follow a system in which they think a child's slow and painful death is a gift.\n\nOkay, that sounded harsh perhaps, and I did say I would recommend it to a certain person. I would recommend it to the Christian casual gamer. This game could be a stepping stone for some to experience games with a rich story. And I would recommend it to those who perhaps could overlook the religious aspects as I guess a sort of anthropologic study of those who use faith to help cope with truly saddening events.  Numinous Games has proven they have the chops to design beautiful games and act the hell out of a story. I just hope the next game they produce is one I can connect to.","March 25","false","1.5"," 95 of 172 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","95","172","4","2"

It deals with both the happy moments that are brought about from that small time of interaction, to both the internal turmoil it no doubt brings. It also strives to encapsulate how many of us deal with death, be it an accepting fate, or looking to God for advice.\n\nDoes it handle it well? I'd say in 70% of the game, it does. That 30% also isn't bad by any means, but it's done in a prose that gives it an air of presumptiveness that I highly doubt it means to give, but I couldn't help but wanted to move on to the next scene from. That said, That Dragon, Cancer's high moments EASILY overpower these failings, and a few select chapters are exceptionally strong on their own.\n\nTo avoid the longwinded discussion of "what is a game" and abuse of funds this title gets tied into, I think this experience is well worth the price. As usual, it's a more whole-hearted reccomendation at a sale price, but I feel it's something that everyone will get something from, be it personally or in a larger sense.","January 28","true","2.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Stories like these tell me it's okay to despair. It's okay to be angry, to be shaken to your core. It's okay to be human.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, our salvation does not lie in our own hands. We don't actually have control over what happens in our lives--just what we do in response.

They talk about the new baby feeling like a replacement for their child dying of cancer, and how it would be hard to love a new baby if it just felt like a replacement. The father talks about the frustration of being unable to do anything for his son to make the pain stop. This game is a very emotional experience, and one I won't soon forget. Videogames are increasingly a new form of media to tell stories in unique ways that other mediums can't. This is a 3 hour long experience (like a movie) costs $15 (also like a movie) and will give you a long memorable experience. This game does explore loss through a christian perspective, and doubting your faith in god while losing someone dear to you. This is done in such a way that I dont believe it would bother athiests, but as a Christian myself I may be biast. -PR0XIDIAN","May 23","true","3.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

A beautifully personal experience with a series of unique scenes that illicited a range of emotions. From wonderment to intense discomfort and fear, the game has a constant human edge and fragility that makes it quite unique and engaging.\n\nHowever, there are a few drawbacks that should be acknowledged. As far as gameplay the pacing takes a few moments to adjust to and largely remains consistent, however there were definitely several moments where the game stalls a few seconds too long and I was left looking around for the next object to click or place to move, but I just had to wait for the scene to progress. The point and click movement style also in general was hit and miss for me. In some scenes, such as the bird ones it felt natural. However others where you are walking around, I couldn't help but wish it used wasd+mouse. Finding things to click felt a little clunky at times because of this.  Also the weird mouse de-accelleration was clearly included to help with the pacing and slower style of the game but it made it a little difficult to find a good mouse sensitivity for me and looking around was a bit of a chore sometimes. These mechanical elements were a little frustrating and occasionally broke my immersion in the game, but ultimately were mostly trivial to the overall experience.\n\nAlso, it should be noted for those going into the game that there are several scenes that are densely Christian. This includes bible passages and personal stories laden with devout faith in God and a grapplig with questioning of this faith. I personally found this quite alienating and offputting, this is probably partially due to it being a little unexpected (I didn't overly research this game prior to purchasing). So for those like myself, I think knowig that it is coming from a devout Christian perspective is probably useful when starting the game. Keep in mind that this religious element is not present in every scene and I personally found the most profound and intense scenes to have it entirely absent (scenes from the doctors office and hospital come to mind). This isn't really a criticism of the game as such, as it is obviously a very personal story about a family's experience and that family happens to be Christian.\n\nRegardless of this I would definitely recommend the game for its uniqueness, its humanity, its beauty and its intensity.","January 12","true","2.1"," 24 of 43 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","24","43","3","0"

I absolutely love art-y type games, especially when they're story based things such as this.\n\nAs an overall, I absolutely loved this game, and I do highly suggest to people to play it. Do keep in mind that there is a heavy religion theme throughout, so if that is something you dislike then you may want to just avoid it. I did spot some odd moments where things didn't seem to be the way they should've (in particular, one particular scene with Joel crying yet he's not even invisible even though it seems like he should be there).\n\nThat Dragon, Cancer will make you cry. This is a game you'll likely only play through once however, so I'd highly suggest trying to find it on sale if possible. It is worth the couple hours it'll take to play it though, so once you're able to find it on a sale, pick it up as soon as you can. This game is an easy recommend from me, so long as you keep in mind that it'll likely only last you one playthrough and it has heavy religious themes (they are done well, at least).","April 8","true","4.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I will say this though, for a game it really does not take much to be amazing and moving. A game doesn't need crazy graphics in my opinion. It just takes a good story and something that the player can relate to.\n\nTo wrap this up I just want to say that it isn't only relatable if you've had someone die or go through cancer because I've never had anyone die or go through cancer and this game still moved me. Because being put in the shoes of someone who was, was heartbreaking, life changing, I don't really know other words to descibe it because I really want to do the game justice.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harvoksteam/recommended/419460/","Harvoksteam","sharkboy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harvoksteam/","94 products in account","That Dragon, Cancer is an indie game created by Developer and Programmer Ryan Green and tells the tragic story of he and his wife’s (Amy Green) personal experience of having a son diagnosed with a very rare and very aggressive form of cancer. The Game goes into detail expressing the feelings of the Family when dealing with the disease and the struggles that both Joel and the Parents face.\n\nWith a story such as That Dragon, Cancer a question often asked is would the game would have benefited being a written story or a movie (granted the documentary for the making of the game is going to be released soon and will no doubt show more details regarding the story) rather than a game. I feel that the story of That Dragon, Cancer could not have been told in any other way that would have been more beneficial to the overall tale. This is because the game allows for the player to more deeply connect and empathize with the character’s as they go through their hardships struggling along with the parents of Joel their struggles become the player’s struggles. The struggles are represented through the game’s mechanics and the interactivity allows the player to more deeply connect and empathize with both the parents and Joel as the game dynamics detail what it was really like for them to go through it on a more interactive and close level.\n\nThis technique of using game mechanics to tell a story has been used before, most notably in Anna Anthropy’s Dys4ia where having her story detailed through the mechanics and rule set of a game gave allowed her to tell her story in a way which no other form of media had access to and overall helped her communicate her story in a more meaningful and interesting way. She used the game mechanics to demonstrate to the player how she felt in a way that words never could. That Dragon, Cancer has the same idea but instead of using abstract artistry and design it goes for a much more visceral and direct means of 87617161_green-familycommunicating its message. Visceral is the only way to describe the overwhelming sadness when playing this game as the horrific events come one after the other and give little time for the character’s or the player to have respite. However That Dragon, Cancer is not always sad which makes those sad moments even more so, An example of this is the section of the game where Joel is racing around on his toy car in the hospital, the game turns into a pseudo Mario cart type game. Joel races around on his little car picking up power ups, only these power ups are representative of things to do with chemotherapy. This constantly reminds you that all though the moment right now is joyful, there will be sad moments in the future.\n\nThroughout the game a big emphasis is put on the parents faith. Both Ryan and Amy Green are christian in real life and as such this is shown in the game. During the story both Ryan and Amy have different spiritual experiences. Amy has faith that God will perform and miracle and save her son, she has doubts but thinks that by having doubts that God may not save her son that it lessens the chance of such miracle happening so throughout that-dragon-cancer-park-at-the-edge-of-the-world1the story the player sees that Amy is constantly shoving aside her doubts and trying her best to believe that God will save her son even until the very end. Ryan however has a much different experience, His experience is one of despair as he feels that God will not save his son as he is not ‘important’ enough in Gods eyes, Ryan feels that God does not have time to save his son and this makes him feel depressed and unworthy throughout the game. However Ryan still tries to maintain faith praying for god to cure his son. During the Game there is a section where the player is in a church and if they go up to the stand the room will go dark and some of the candles will light up, in the background both Ryan and Amy can be heard desperately praying for God to save their son, eventually the candles will go out however the player can light them again. This creates a constant struggle of the player trying to keep as many candles lit as possible even though it is impossible to have them all lit whilst Ryan and Amy are heard in the background desperately praying to try and save their son. This produces the feeling of panic and desperation within the player as they constantly attempt to keep the candles lit similar to how the parents felt at the time praying for their son. The player feels empathetic towards the parents as it feels like they went through those same feelings.\n\nThe saddest part for some player’s in That Dragon, Cancer isn’t specifically the games story or sections, a lot of player’s will find a way that this story relates to a personal experience that they had. Whether that be an experience with cancer or having a sick family member The game manages to bring out those same feelings that the player might of had when they went through that experience, amplifying its emotional effect on the player. This is one of the strongest yet saddest points about the story in That Dragon, Cancer is that the story is relatable. Many of the players will reach the card section of the game and see a card that reminds them of that experience they had, amplifying the effectiveness of the games story as if the players feels like they can relate to the game then they are much more likely to have an emotional reaction to the game as they would if it were in real life.\n\nOverall That Dragon, Cancer is a game that hits the player right where it hurts. The games compelling and interesting yet depressing story draws the player in and outright punches them in the heart with its harrowing tale of a son with cancer.","March 29","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I prefer my steam reviews to be indepth so if you want short and sweet, this isn't it.\n\nThis Dragon, Cancer is an interactive experience about two of the main developers (the Green family) losing their son, Joel, to cancer. The game is designed as a tribute to him.\n\nI brought this game after the recent fiasco about how it never made a single cent in sales, but I had it on my radar for many years. I for one am someone who loves one time, amazing, well crafted narratives and as a game developer myself, I don't believe a game needs to have a complex narrative with branching story plot.\n\nSure you could argue the game would be better as a movie, but it's deliberately made as a game so that users can experience a part of what the Green's were going through and basically...the game is all about emotion and you projecting yourself onto the story arc.\n\nThe soundtrack for this game is amazing, I'm going to buy it ASAP because it's a really nicely done soundtrack, while the low poly art style works well both technically and as a way to project yourself into the arc, which it was intended to do.\n\nThe game definetly relies alot on emotion and if you don't have emotion then this game is not for you. I read as  many of the cards as I could in the hospital, until it got so much for me that I started to break down.\n\nThe game also includes briefly other peoples cancer stories and having family members who died of cancer, this part really hits home for me...hard.\n\nI'd recommend this game, however I do agree that the price tag is steep. But then I also believe it shouldn't be brought on sale, it should be brought at full price as I'd feel like I'd ripped off a charitable donation if I brought it on sale. I like the art style, narrative and the soundtrack and I doubt it could have achieved the same effect if done any other way  (say, as a movie).\n\nIt also hit home for me to many other aspects of my life, especially as my name is Joel, the same as one of the Green's sons. Not even just about cancer, but about loss, grief, hope, illnesses (including mental illnesses) and lots of other aspects.\n\nI'd rate it an 8/10.","March 26","true","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAviatorPenguin/recommended/419460/","TheAviatorPenguin","TheAviatorPenguin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAviatorPenguin/","63 products in account","Is this really a game?  No, not really, not in any conventional sense.  It's a personal, frank, honest and (I believe) accurate exploration of looking after a critically ill child.  Whilst it's short (~2 hours), it has to rank as the single most emotional and moving experience I've had in games, in fact it worked better than I ever thought it possible to.  I don’t think it’s something I can say I “enjoyed”, I wept fairly openly at several points, but it’s something I’m glad I experienced and I would recommend it to anyone with an interest.\n\nFull disclosure, I backed this at the time of the Kickstarter in November 2014.  At the time my son was about 9 months post bone marrow transplant for Leukaemia, and we had been immersed in “That Dragon” (for want of a better phrase), and all it entailed, for just under 18 months at that point.  I didn’t know whether I would ever play it, all I knew was that I wanted this to exist.\n\nFast forward another 14 months, our path has taken a more positive note than Joel’s.  Sadly many of the friends we made on the way are still fighting or were not so lucky, so it was with some fear I clicked on the download button.  Was this going to be some mawkish “suffering porn”?  Would I recognise the feelings expressed?  I knew there was a religious bent (the Green’s are strongly committed Christians), would it rub the atheist in me the wrong way?  Fortunately as I played through the first few scenes, my fears were soon shown to be unfounded.  The game unfolds as a series of vignettes with relatively basic controls, playing much like a simple point and click adventure for the most part, though it will never win awards on the basis of game mechanics.  Where it shines is in the openness with which the Green’s hopes, fears, concerns and dreams are worked in, and how they have managed to capture everything from the hope of treatment, to the all-consuming nature of the care that Joel requires, to the despair of setbacks (and in Joel’s case, terminal diagnosis), to brief moments of levity in the hospital.  The Green’s feelings, whilst couched in more religious terms than I would personally use, are perfectly relatable and beautifully expressed, capturing well the range and nuances of the emotions that families in this situation face, the religious beliefs are obvious but are neither evangelical nor off-putting in any way.\n\nIt’s worth pausing on the point about moments of levity, as I’ve seen a couple of publications question whether they make sense in context; my view is that they make perfect sense.  Anyone that has spent any time on a paediatric oncology/haematology ward or in the related clinics will attest to the fact that an awful lot of time and effort is expended by everyone (not least the parents) to make the whole thing as un-miserable for the kids as possible.  I’ve lost count of the number of dads I’ve seen racing up and down ward corridors, kids on their shoulders or in prams, making racing car noises or rat-a-tat-tat sounds, or dodged a small child on a trike only to nearly bump into their carer pushing along a stand full of infusion pumps, each of which is attached to said child.  Whilst I appreciate this might seem odd in the context of a game that you would expect to be straight-up and po-faced, it captures perfectly the need to create levity wherever and whenever possible, for the child’s sake if nothing else.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a beautifully crafted interactive experience and can rightly be considered as gaming putting it’s best foot forwards as a serious medium for exploring weighty topics.","January 12","true","2.9"," 29 of 55 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","29","55","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/illilli/recommended/419460/","illilli","A Very Concerned Fruit Bat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/illilli/","381 products in account","TLDR recommendation: I don't recommend the 'game,' but the story is something to be seen. Don't buy the game, and instead, donate the money to cancer research or directly to the family (if there is a way) and watch a stream of it. The game is frustrating at times and I feel it distracts from the emotion of the story.\n\n\n\n\nThe question is, do I recommend this 'game'? Game... no. Story, yes. In fact, I think the game aspect actually takes away from the story.\n\nI read the reviews and I read their website. I never watched videos though, because I didn't want to get spoiled. And for the most part, I knew what I was getting into.\n\nI bought this game because I wanted to support the family and I wanted to be sucked into the emotions that they had during this struggle. I wanted to be brought to tears. I wanted to be emotionally hurt. But in the end... I just simply wasn't, and I blame the 'game' side of it.\n\nThere are many times when you just sort of wander/fly around without direction and you aren't entirely sure of where to go (This could be a heavy dose of symbolism, and I get that). The problem with that, is that there is simply NO direction at all. Some in game triggers require you sit in one spot and listen for a while, or you walk back and forth from one area to another, repeat, repeat, repeat until the next event triggers. You spend a lot of time just saying "I have no idea what I'm doing, I'm just sort of pushing buttons." I still don't know what we were supposed to actually do to advance in the story. There are many occasions where you just sort of hit buttons until something happens. But then there are also moments where you sit there and hit buttons..... but nothing ever happens beyond this loop. But you're not told to give up and walk away, so you don't know if you're really supposed to keep hitting those buttons.\n\nSo here is my problem. The story will hit you hard with an emotional moment, but then it will immediately transition to a frustrating "I just don't know what I'm supposed to be doing???" moment. And while this could be symbolic, I personally feel that it distracted me from the story.\n\n\nSo at the end of this review, here is my recommendation. I suggest that you take the money you were going to spend on the game to support the family, and either donate it to cancer research or find a means of getting it to the family. After doing so, watch a stream of this game online somewhere. This way, you get to experience the story without having to play the frustrations, but also more than 10% of the money will end up going to charity.\n\nI think it is a beautiful story and I think it's awesome that this even exists. Leaving it at being simply an homage to their son, it's beautiful. But selling it to people in order for them to indulge in the feeling of tragedy.... it could use a bit of tidying up. But, then again, everyone is different and everyone has their own opinions/stories/reasons for doing/saying/feeling how they do.","May 10","false","1.9"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","15","28","0","0"

Everyone is walking the tight-rope of "acceptability" on this due to the subject.  I think we need to take a moment to break this down by looking at a summary of the other reviews, with my thought on them sprinkled in.  At the end I will explain why I ended up paying money for this game.\n\nFrom many of the reviews you will see that the game has a great style.  I completely agree with this as the art, the voice acting, the story are each superb in their delivery of an emotionally rife game experience.  They all add up and blend together to pull you in.\n\nI have also seen that the basic mechanics can be difficult and do somewhat hamper the immersive aspect of the game.  Once again, I am in agreement with those points.  There were times where my attention was solely focused on trying to figure out just what the game was expecting me to do and it pulled me out of the moment.\n\nAs has been noted time and again, religious content is also highly visible and presented with a very specific perspective.  Being such a highly charged topic I will only say that you need to decide if you are willing to sit down and hear what the Green's think and feel about their faith and how that plays in their experience with Joel's fight with cancer.  For them it played a significant part and, as this is their story, it is present in the game.  You don't have to agree with or accept what they think, you just need to decide if you want to listen.  Enough said for now.\n\nFor my own overall opinion, the negative points were quite minor and once I was past them they were completely forgotten in light of the deep impact of this story.\n\nTLDR: Now we come to why I bought, played, and reviewed the game and my recommendation and advice.\n\nAs a new "Dada", this one hit me right in the tear-box from the video, even before I bought it.  Deeply emotional, I had to consider hard if this was a journey I was willing to make and a subject matter I was willing to immerse myself in.  Ultimately, I bought it because I wanted to support the family.  I could have let it sit there but I played it because... I wanted to see if I could handle it.  I needed to know, on a deeply personal level, if I could be exposed to this sort of situation "first hand" and come out the other end intact.  When I finished I was mostly intact but never will I forget what I felt imagining that this was my child.  I will never be the same for witnessing this story in this way.  I look at my child and my time with them very differently now.\n\nBuy it to support the family if that is something you are willing to do.  Buy it if you want to have a very poignant, narrative driven, game experience.  Buy it if you want support the Indie Dev world.  Whatever your reason, make sure that once you've bought it you take time to play through it with an open mind and heart.  If you play it while closed off to the emotions of others you will likely not have a worth-while time with this game.  If you are open, this very likely will change the way you interact with those you love.  At least for a good long while.","March 31","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The soundtrack, poetic language, and artistic gameplay all played a positive part in the game!\n\nI understand that not all gamers appreciated the religious aspect that this game introduced, but I found it to be really great! Whether you're Christian or not, the purpose of this game isn't to have you be the main character of a story (like most games do), but instead, to witness the story as if a fly on the wall--aimlessly and hopelessly watching. This game is all focused on this family, their struggles, and their beliefs, as they walk us through a sadly realistic narrative of Joel and his battle with cancer.\n\nLike I said before, this game is great! I would recommend this game to anyone (yes, anyone), Christian, non-Christian--doesn't matter. Only because, despite the reference to God, this game gives you a perspective into a life that not all of us have had to deal with--with beliefs that we may or may not have. It makes the lives of others a reality to us. We get to see into the lives of other people, which is more valuable than most realize. It gets us out of our own heads and perspectives, and sets us into a world where there is more than just 1 main character.\n\n","March 29","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't do puzzles, but more ... varied activites to progress the exposition?)  In some ways, this is the most real game I've ever played.\n\nI will focus on the faith elements in this game. It is not a "Christian video game," it is a game about Christians. It doesn't attempt to convert you, or even to present a moral. However, faith is a central part of this family's life, and so their faith is a deep part of this game. And there is a lot of sublety going on, which is not common. For example, the title of this game does become deeper towards the end of the game. And another example is  near the end, you are in a cathedral, at a prayer service for the child, who is either dying or already dead. You can light candles, but they don't stay lit long enough. You can also play notes on a piano. Most of them are impassioned prayers. Some of them are primitive drums, or notes from a ram's horn. You try to find the right notes to play, as if that would save Joel. It doesn't. And is there a difference between our modern prayers, and a primitive drum?\n\nI will also share one story about my experience in this game: When I was about 3/4 through the game, I was at my emotional limit. I'm feeling a bond with the Christian parents, but I'm asking all sorts of questions about my faith, and my life. So I turn off the game, and stare at the cieling. When I look down, I see the green "new item" icon in Steam. "Card drops? in this game? That is messed up. I click on it, and it says I have a new game in my inventory. It's a gift from a buddy of mine from church. "I saw this game, and it was the type of thing you liked." The game?

It is pretty sad and gives a good view on the horrors of cancer. In a way, this game is pretty incredible.\n\nI really admire the way the creators made this game and were able to create this rough topic very well. The developers shifted the game more into a memorial for Joel(In my opinion is understandable). Each scene is so well created and developed to really give you that feeling. I really enjoyed the poetic, slow pace of the game. There were a few times the controls got a tiny bit irritating but I never had to much of a problem with it. I feel the design of everything appearing and disappearing before switching the surrounding really fits the way this game is about their memory with Joel.\n\nMy most favorite thing about this game is Joel. I loved to make him giggle and everytime I would hear it, I got a smile on my face. Along with hearing the family stories. Some of them really got to me, hearing them all talk about a subject and forget about cancer really made it well. About the second half it really went down the path of god and was really strong with religion (Depending on your beliefs you may or may not enjoy this part). It just made me sad with all the questions that Dad asked himself.\n\nI believe this game has changed the perspective I have on life. I've experienced what the pain of a loved one with cancer is like, but luckily never had to deal with death. It is such a good game, you should consider buying it.\n","January 21","true","3.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is at least one of those for everyone and both for a great many.\n\nIt doesn’t ring true to call this a ‘game.’ I’m not certain what title to give it, actually; interactive experience, maybe? At the very least, it transcends the current labels, it’s an example of where a ‘game’ might be able to bring someone emotionally. Rather than reaching ever higher for graphical fidelity or ever deeper for the most ‘movie-like’ experience, this game just puts one in possibly the most powerless and truly human experience one can go through. And it asks of you but one thing, feel this.\n\nI did feel it. And I was weeping, grinding my teeth and hating myself for buying this game. But, I was also so very pleased to see someone pushing the boundaries, trying something new and succeeding with it.\n\nIf you’re able and willing to immerse yourself in the vignettes, to turn off the outside world, which includes critiques outside of what the experience itself is bringing you, I think you’ll find something exceptional here. You’ll find the human condition, that of confusion, frustration, powerlessness and, yes, faith.\n\nI wish Ryan, Amy and all of the other contributors to this piece all the best. Not my sympathy, they get that for losing their child. But, for producing this, for showing what this medium can do, can be, they deserve more than I alone can give. They deserve funding and producers that will continue to accept the risk that the production of such experiences undoubtedly bring.\n\nKeep up the good work.\n","February 3","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Despite what your first reaction might be to hearing that professionals didn’t record voice over for the game, the end result is surprisingly personal, and very well suited to the game.\n\nThis is where Dragon shines. The real moments between a family is something that I found very heart warming and sombre at the same time, even not having children of my own. These moments feel so organic and genuine because they actually are, much more than they would have if professional voice actors had recorded dialogue.\n\nAs the story progresses, It is very clear that when the game’s lead developer, Ryan Green, pitches this game as “A videogame developer's love letter to his son”, he means it. A number of chapters are extremely personal and introspective of life and his faith, it is very evident to me that this game was a form of therapy to him in one way or another.\nDragon does set the stage to be a very emotional affair, and having a few friends who have dealt with cancer in their lives, I was expecting to add it to my list of games that made me cry. As the credits started playing however, I was surprised that the game never came close to hitting that emotional tone for me. The family’s faith is featured very prominently during the most emotional sections, which for anyone who is religious is understandable given the situation. I respect the game for addressing the ideas of faith, and for anyone who is religious I imagine these moments are all the more impactful for it. For me however, as someone who is very cynical about faith and religions, especially when involving tragedies like terminal childhood diseases, most of these moments of god talk did little more but distract and take me out of the moment.\nVisually, That Dragon, Cancer is a very pleasant game to look at. While obviously not trying to be the next Crysis benchmark, and not breaking any new ground in the style department, the game makes effective use of the low-poly model look. Strangely I encountered Z-fighting in a few areas, and what I *think* was a strange glitch with a couple of the models. While these issues are minor and nothing game breaking, they are basic problems I would expect to be fixed before release.\n\nFinally we reach the actual game play, something I purposefully left to the end because I believe it to be the worst part of this interactive experience. Much of Dragon is point and click navigation from a first person perspective, with what I think of as “areas of interest”; players click to move forward and the camera animates to the next point in the level, giving it a Google Street View vibe. There are more involved “game play” section, often using a third person perspective and giving real-time control to the player. These sections do nothing but detract from the experience. These mini-games are extremely basic, something I would expect to learn how to make as a first year in a university programming course. While that in and of itself is not a bad thing, I didn’t find them to really contribute to the story telling of the game. What’s worse is that they are poorly executed; the controls are spongy and unresponsive, and half of the time it is not clear what the game wants you to do. One of the climax scenes seemed to be a puzzle I was supposed to solve, I spent a good few minutes trying to figure the game out before I was abruptly thrust into the conclusion. I’m still not sure if I actually managed to get things right out of pure luck or the game was just tired of me trying to figure it out and moved on by itself. There is however, one very good mini game in the form of a short 2D platformer. And while it’s not really difficult, I did enjoy that part of the game and the analogy it contributed to the story.\n\nThese moments, with the exception of the 2D platformer, makes it seem that the game is self-conscious; that it needs to have these sections of game play or else be written off as another Dear Ester walking simulator not worth your time. The prime example of this is the kart racing mini game. Yes, there is a Mario kart, in That Dragon, Cancer, and it is as awkward as it sounds. I personally have never been a lover of the “walking simulator” style games, but I do think that they have value. The Stanley Parable, The Beginners Guide, both of those games know what they are, embraced it, and are great experiences I thoroughly enjoyed because of that. Dragon could remove these awkward chapters without changing its emotional tone and would be a better experience for it.\n\nAt the end of the day, That Dragon, Cancer is a heartfelt story wrapped up in an inconsistent package. A pretty package, to be sure, but one that left me mostly unsatisfied. For those who are connoisseurs of games in the interactive experience genre, there is probably a lot to like here. For those like me, who do enjoy the occasional interactive experience like The Stanley Parable, might be drawn in by the story, but will leave frustrated after dealing with the poor execution of the game. That Dragon, Cancer gets a solid 6 in my book.\n\nDespite what some might think of as a low score for the game, I actually do want to recommend Dragon to people. However, when you consider the game’s price, and that I was finished with the experience after about an hour and forty-five minutes, it’s just too much to recommend people go out and by when you consider the game’s problems. Were this a $5 game, then yes, it would be a definite recommendation. As it is now, if you are interested in experiencing That Dragon, Cancer, wait for a sale.\n\nScore: 6/10\nRecommendation: Wait for a sale\n","February 7","false","1.9"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","18","36","2","0"

There are a few references, and you may not feel connected for certain actions the characters take. Unfortunately, a huge chunk of the later part, including the climax is like that, which makes the experience a bit underwhelming towards the end.\n\nAs many people mentioned, the journey is very personal for the developer and his family/friends, and that could not be tailored to suit everyone.

There are a lot of things I liked about this game, and a few things that I didn't. Regardless, I am happy to take small part in the existence of this small child who stuggled to eat and loved dogs. The narrative is fragmented and dreamlike, which is something I'm sure that many who have lost a loved one can understand. The ending is vague, and the feeling of emptiness is pervasive yet reigned in by the knowledge that pain is an affirmation of our love and the emptiness the recognition of the unoccupied space that was once held by someone we cared for deeply.

The story comes first, meaning the gameplay itself is simple, which is okay because this game isn’t meant to be a gameplay heavy game.\n\nIt’s a narrative that completely works on so many levels to show the happy, sad and frustrating times about this little boy who has cancer, as seen from the eyes of his family, but mainly from the eyes of his father. And this is when the game shines. When the father would monologue, I was moved by what he says and truly felt an emotional attachment to Joel and everyone else.\n\nThe wife’s speeches were also done well. And her belief that god would save the baby and the utter realization of there not being anyone to help them, made me feel very emotional and even tear up a little. The graphics while pretty bland are actually done well because it didn’t take me away from the narrative but still helped me paint a picture.\n\nThe soundtrack makes the game amazing too. While you won’t find things that really stand out it accompanies the narration and story, and that’s enough. The acting, as I said before are done very well and this is what mainly made the narrative so moving and really let me see how the parents were in their own shoes.\n\nThe gameplay itself is simply clicking and looking around rooms usually being narrated by either the mother or father and the soundtrack in the background.\n\nThe start does this very well even though the boring clicking is there, it’s only there to show the narrative, which makes it wonderful.\n\nBut nearing the end of the game I felt that it started to become too gameplay heavy and while the narration was there, which was done great as it was the whole way through; it still didn’t drown out the boring clicking enough as it became more focussed on gameplay.\n\nBut like I said, the narration is there and other than a small bug forcing me to skip a little part, that there’s nothing really wrong with this game.\n\nSo this game, I’m guessing; was made to show people the story of Joel, and how the up’s and down’s of his story affected the parents; to make us feel what they felt.\n\nAnd this game completely does that, no doubt. With its great soundtrack, graphics which may be dull but good enough to paint the picture, and a moving dialogue, makes this game a must play to all gamers who can enjoy a narrative even though this game has some issues such as a couple bugs and some boring sections nearing the end of the game.\n3.5/5","January 21","true","2.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The final scene is such a potent, piercing portrait of a state of grace that I feel the aftershocks of it as I write this.\n\nThat Dragon, Cancer opened doors in me that I thought were long closed.

I am guessing Unity engine, but I didnt't check it. The music is most of the time serene piano playing, which is why I have a hard time to recall memorable characteristics about it another than that.\n\nControls are even more simple than recent walking simulators. It's more like a "click-to-walk-to-another-perspective" simulator. Don't buy this expecting  challenging gameplay or for entertainment, that's for sure.\n\nIgnore the hype/drama/trolling around this game, ask yourself instead "Do I want to experience a game about a lost battle with cancer? What was/is/may be my way to deal with such a situation?" Religion or rather faith to a god takes a huge part in this game, a topic that I can't relate to. It doesn't tarnish this game's worth from my perspective.

(That part is fine with me, actually. This kind of "non-game" interactive art is something I love.)\n\nThe problem was with the execution. I would have been more immersed in it if the controls didn't feel so clunky. I was pulled out of a lot of emotional moments when the mouse was acting up, or when I wasn't sure what I needed to do for the scene to progress. There were times I was bored standing in place just listening to the voices in the background. I wanted to hear the whole dialogue, so I was unable to move much or I would miss out on the sounds. I would have liked more interactivity in those bits, or more ability to explore without going out of rance of the dialogue.\n\nFor the price, it could have been much more polished than it was. I don't think it was worth $15. It would have been worth $15 if it was either longer or more polished. I'm hoping that maybe the game will have some updates to make it feel more fluid and seamless. It feels unfair that some scenes were stripped of their full emotional potential because of my annoyance at the game mechanics.\n\nParents will probably be more deeply touched by the game despite the technical problems. Personally, it reminded me of all the reasons why I don't want children. I don't mean that rudely at all - parents are amazing and we need them to raise the next generation. I am so thankful for all of you who take on the huge responsibility and vulnerability of having children. I doubt that there is a worse feeling than the death of a child. One reason I don't want kids is because I am not willing to take on the risk of feeling that. Well, that and the sound of kids crying.\n\nI was still touched, though. Some of it hit close to home. Spoiler for the last scene of the game: I know a boy who died recently who also loved blowing bubbles, and I've liked to imagine that maybe he's in heaven blowing bubbles. So blowing bubbles for Joel, in what I'm assuming was a depiction of what Joel's heaven might be like, made me cry a little. Also, I was frustrated with Joel's mother for believing so strongly that Joel would be healed through a miracle. There was a situation like that in my own family that, well, caused some people to make bad decisions. It's good, in my eyes, if a game can make us feel such things.\n\nI wish Steam had a "maybe" option for recommendations. But I'll go with a yes, just with some reservations. I enjoyed it more than I would have a movie of the same length, because of the interactivity and creativity. And I guess it costs around the same as a movie ticket, so I shouldn't complain too much about the price.","January 13","true","1.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Read on:\nWhat does it mean to vote up or down? Voting up does NOT mean I enjoyed playing this game. I DID NOT ENJOY IT...\n\nThis is the most emotionally challenging game I've played. But I expected that. The developer walked a tightrope between genuine creative expression and potential sensationalism. I'm certain they struggled with this.\n\nAt its heart, "That Dragon, Cancer" gives us a very intimate perspective of a family's struggle with cancer, diagnosed in their youngest and most vulnerable member, baby Joel. Throughout the game, baby Joel becomes our baby. Your baby. And that's where it hits you hardest. That's where it does something no other game has... AND that's where it does something ONLY games can do!\n\nThe art style is simple but effective. Player interaction is also simple, relying mainly on you looking around for cursor prompts to click on. I often felt as though I was waiting on the game to catch up on my intentions. But the game surprised me often enough to keep me interested. And of course, I was busy looking after baby Joel.\n\nFor all its flaws, the game is only successful to me because it forced me to care. And that's something few games do.\n\nAre games the proper medium for this type of content? Maybe. There are a million ways to do this WRONG. But the developer did a lot of things right, and I want to recognize that. This is dangerous territory... And though I'm not a Christian myself, I recognize grace. I'm proud of them and I want to support games like this.\n\nThis is not a fun game and it defies most of the criteria we use to judge games.

I can't remember the last time i actually took the time to pick up the phone and just say "hey, i love you" to them. I Have three younger siblings that i've seen once since her death, and my grandparents (her parents) call me every major holiday and every birthday, and even send me gifts all the way from Tennesee to Texas.\n\nAnd I always let it go to voicemail, because the thought of reminding myself of her scares me.\n\nI'm 23 now, and i've been avoiding this demon for far too long. i've been living in a town hours away from my family, working dead-end jobs and generally not going anywhere with my life. I have a girlfriend that nobody in my family has met in person, despite her being with me for two years.\n\nI suppose what i'm trying to say is this:\n\nDont take the people you love for granted, because they won't always be there.\nTake five minutes out of your day, call your mom, dad, sister, boyfriend, whoever. Just call them and say "hey, i thought about you today." because tomorrow, a thought is all they might be.\n\nI'm going to recomend this game because it serves as a reminder of how fragile our lives truly are.\n\nWhen i feel like i'm starting to forget about my family again, or if i think it's okay to not talk to them anymore, i'm going to play this game. I'm not going to run away from this anymore. i'm going to call my stepdad, siblings, grandparents, and i'm going to tell them i love them, because in five years i might not get the chance to say it again, and i've already got five years of time to make up.\n\ndunno if the devs looks at steam reviews, but if they see this, then thanks. you've helped me rediscover the love that only a family can give.","January 16","true","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

However the more I thought about it what did bother me is the creators using their now dead child's illness, as a way to make profit. They claim it's a tribute, but it's not just a tribute if you are getting paid at upwards of 20 bucks every time this game gets downloaded it is obviously become do to a bit of good publicity become fairly lucrative.\n\nI think this bothered me more than any of the religious aspect of the game. Couple that brainwave by the fact that his parents are now also making a documentry which no doubt will also be peddled for profit. Now if a precentage of this game was going to charity, or these people were big advocates of research, or donating to the children's hospital that treated their son with this "tribute" I would feel way more at ease paying the price I did. After doing my research after purchasing the game I realized that this was not the case. I feel for the family, and to have lost a child is heartbreaking but with all this hype and wide spread media about the game I can't help but think they could do more besides cash their own check...as a "tribute" to their son. I think a more fitting tribute would be to donate to research, or hell even to hospital funds that help provide extra comfort items to children who are also fighting the dragon for parents that can't afford them etc.","January 22","true","1.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's enjoyable in a way that I didn't know a game could be. It is intensely personal. Powerful in it's ability to evoke emotion.\n\nI heard about this game on Radiolab in the episode "The Cathedral."

We just don't know it. Whether through miscarriage or illness, the death of a child is an issue that we too often sweep under the rug in social interactions. We don't ask people how they're coping. We don't ask people what they're feeling. It's a scary topic and we ignore it. We think they don't want to talk about what they've gone through, and while in some cases this may be true I also believe that's an excuse we use to avoid the conversation.\n\nThis videogame brings the issue of child loss to light in a profound and inspiring way. As the father of very young children, this game filled me with both overwhelming gratitude and overwhelming saddness. Yet in playing it I bore wittness to an experience that has been a silent part of the lives of so many people I know: family members, friends, colleagues, etc.\n\nThank you for designing this incredible experience.

That is why it only registers as me having 1 hour. I have finished the game, however.\n\nAlso, mild spoilers.\n\n"That Dragon, Cancer" is intended to be a heart-wrenching, tragic depiction of a young boy named Joel's struggle and eventual death at the hands of the most hated disease known to man: cancer. It's based on a true story, and chronicles the parents' emotions, feelings, and spiritual musings as their son's state gradually deteriorates.\n\nHere are my pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n-Beautiful soundtrack.\n-Competent voice acting, considering the voice actors are the parents of the actual boy himself, and are amateurs.\n-Unique and intriguing art style.\n-The emotion in the game is real; if embellished, it's very subtly done.\n\nCONS:\n-Ridiculous $14.99 price tag.\n-Textures clip and animation falters several times.\n-Controls are laggy, counterintuitive, and annoying, even for a sort of point-and-click.\n-Mini games accomplish nothing and often serve to disconnect from the overall theme. They don't convey much emotion and feel out of place.\n-The game has to be finished in one sitting, or you're completely emotionally disconnected and just kinda annoyed.\n-It's often hard to tell what the game wants from you. I spent ten minutes with Dolphin Dad doing underwater flips with no idea what I was supposed to be doing.\n-I completely broke the "Jesus loves me" song and ended up with it playing over itself out of sync half a dozen times. Honestly, that was pretty funny. That should be in the pros.\n\n\nNow, to the actual review.\n\n"That Dragon, Cancer" is a good story in the form of a terrible game. The artwork, while initially charming, eventually loses its beauty, becoming a confusing miasma of fractured textures and unimpressive design. The controls are laggy, buggy, and sluggish. The minigames feel forced and pointless. I would have enjoyed this a lot more left as a pure walking simulator.\n\nNow to the story.\n\nYou feel the pain of Joel's parents as their child struggles to grow, his disease evident to even his siblings. The beginning of the game is promising, even a bit tear jerking, although I did not cry. (Not to say I'm incapable of crying. Games such as "Undertale", "To The Moon", "Among the Sleep" and "I am Bread" made the tears flow liberally.) The parents are struggling as they attempt to find peace through a completely tragic experience, putting their faith and trust in God to save their son. This is a recurring theme, and perhaps even the main theme of the game, more so than Joel's cancer. The father feels angry that God is allowing this. The mother is angry that the father is angry. Where is God? Will Jesus take their son to heaven? Will he live?\n\nThe emotion is often times well conveyed. The hospital scene near the end was one of the painful scenes I've ever played. The utter helplessness you feel annoyed me at first, until I realised that is exactly what I was supposed to feel. At which point, I appreciated it. That I was trying so hard to find a way to escape the room, to escape the crying, was a testament to good storytelling. Either that, or i have 7 youngest siblings, and I hate to hear babies cry. One of the two. On the other hand, sometimes the emotion is horribly portrayed. Like dolphin dad. That was just stupid.\n\nSo this game is a bit up and down. One moment, you'll feel the pain, the emotion, and the beauty that this game is conveying, and the next, you'll be utterly lost. Like that "Throne of God" scene. What was I supposed to do with that piano? I just spammed lmb at that point. Which is too bad, because I think that was a really important moment in the game?\n\nAlso, the portrayal of heaven is strange. I mean, that is a lot of pancakes.\n\nSo, in conclusion:\n\nI'm a Christian. I wanted to be touched by this game. I wanted to cry. I wanted to come away with that same feeling of awe that I felt upon finishing "The Beginner's Guide:" that feeling that my perspective on something had been integrally changed forever.\n\nBut I couldn't. I just couldn't get into it. Every time I would, I would immediately be pushed out of it by something strange and unwieldy the game threw at me. I sat there, staring at the credits, feeling guilty that I hadn't like the game.\n\nDon't bother with this one unless it goes on a big sale, folks. Until then, it's just not worth it.","January 20","false","1.0"," 26 of 54 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","26","54","0","0"

Can't wait for the sequel.\n\nBut in all seriosity, this is a great story. The characters are believable and well written. The believability factor is helped by the fact that the game developer experienced this story in his own life and basically made a cool way to tell his story.\n\nThis is obviously not a game that is about mechanics, though there are some mechanics scattered sparsely throughout the game. This is a game about a story which is experienced in an interactive way only videogames can manage.\n\nI'll be honest, I did wish I had more control over my camera and body in the game. The control scheme is not normal WASD, mouse controls. You can literally just play the game just the mouse or just the keyboard. You click where the game lets you walk/fly to move around.\n\nStory-wise, I loved it. There were some points where I was close to tears. My heart was heavy at some parts and light at others. It's interesting how audio can make your mood swing from one end of the spectrum to the other. The voice acting was real. Real good.\n\nIf I were to compare this game to another game that's like this, only it's crap, I'd compare it to The Novelist. The Novelist had a similar aesthetic. It tried to be more "gamey" with mechanics which could have made the game cool, but the writing just sucked. In The Novelist, I did not care about the characters, the voice acting was average to bad (it was boring) and the sound design and music was lacking.\n\nThat Dragon, Cancer has less fundamental "gamey" mechanics, but it fixes every other mentioned problem The Novelist had. The writing is relatable and real, you care about the characters, the sound design is GREAT! If there is a soundtrack DLC, I'll probably get it.\n\nDo I recommend this game/story?

It's one of those "artsy" type games that are more about feels than gameplay. There is almost no gameplay, to be sure. But the feels? It's got that in spades.\n\nNot something to play through if you're currently fighting the sort of struggle depicted, but maybe it might help after your battle is over.\n\nYes, it's only two hours in length, but they openly said such on the store page. You know what you're getting into with this. That said, if you're up for a feel ride, this will give it to you far better than other "artsy" games I've gone through.\n\nMy condolences go to the family once again, and my prayer is that, one day, some blessed minds will forge the weapons needed for slaying all the forms this dragon takes.","January 15","true","2.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

As you may have read there isn't much actual game play, it's more of a journey though a family's tragic experience of loosing a son. The story will lead you though the joys of their son’s laughter to the Conflict’s of struggling emotions and the overall love that holds them together. If your one with a heart I’m sure at some point your eyes will water, if not a few times.\n\nThere are some glitches where you might loose the cursor and have to exit to the Main Menu before continuing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/recommended/419460/","idiobrando","I DIO!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/","517 products in account","I was a lower-tier backer for this game, I backed it because I’m always one for pushing the medium, and personal stories like this are so rarely explored. That Dragon, Cancer isn’t just a game about one family’s struggle dealing with their young son’s losing battle with cancer, it’s actually about all who struggle with the suffering and death of loved ones, but as well those who managed to survive it. This is exemplified in the very best use of Kickstarter backers I’ve seen in a game, reading real letters to those who have been lost, but not forgotten; grandparents, parents, friends, and children. There are stories of a deceased parent never seeing their children grow up and ones of children that never got the chance to live. I made sure to read every single one and I would be lying if I said I didn’t cry. These moments combined with you taking part in some of the events of the Greens’ experiences make for an engaging game that didn’t deviate in making me think that they didn't take advantage of being a game. The game also tends to shy away from being cloying or schmaltzy, it is brutally honest as it details the Greens struggles, their pain, their happiness, and their questioning of faith. May you be religious or not, the Greens get at the core of an ancient question for humanity “why do the good and innocent suffer”? And as I said, this is a game that isn’t just meant as a memorial to Joel Green, it’s meant for everyone, to try and help people explore that grief and despair, but as well as the appreciation and love of those who were a part of our lives. That Dragon, Cancer is not a fun game and I can only imagine how even more brutal it must be for those who lost loved ones too soon and/or are parents. It’s truly powerful as well as the first must play game of the year and I hope it stands as an inspiration for other devs.","January 12","true","2.7"," 17 of 37 people (46%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","46","17","37","4","2"

Controls are wonky, artstlye's horrendous, story's insignificant. Yes, I know, cancer is evil and kids dying is so sad and whatnot but it's nothing that hasn't happened. Before. In fact, kids die from cancer all the time. Facts of life.\nWell of course there's been the bits where we can look at the suffering the parents endured but again - nothing I didn't hear of and/or experience myself.\n\nNow what bothers me the most about this is that this "game" (more like an explorative experience) is really desperately trying to make you cry and feel for the child. Like, really desperately. Well, there's also one or two other stories about dead people who are dead because of cancer but that's negligible.\n\nAnyway, I didn't like it and I didn't think it was worth either my time or my 15€.

While the game did exactly that, several times over, it was a relief to find just how much of a testament to life, hope, and joy the game was despite its grim subject matter. Regardless of your history or whether you've had to deal with tragedy regarding loved ones, there's a good chance this will resonate with your humanity.\n\nI loved how That Dragon, Cancer balances interaction and gameplay with its story and presentation. Rather than limit things to one point of view, you essentially get a glimpse of events through every set of eyes involved, some of which I didn't even expect. The visual style is haunting even in its brightest moments, and music is interwoven as a perfect complement to your progress as you carry on. My favorite element, however, would have to be how the different Kickstarter backer submissions were included. I started getting choked up working through the hall full of art and photographs, and I nearly had to step away from the keyboard once there were cards to read. That's when the whole thing really hit home.\n\nIt was also nice to have the more gamified asides at certain points, like a kart race and a knight's adventure, to both lighten the mood and give you more of a sense of control. With the situation spiraling as it was for Joel's parents, there's a certain helplessness to only being able to stand by and listen to their retelling of it.\n\nI'm sure I missed a thing or two on the first playthrough, so I'm glad there's a scene select option, but I'm gonna need some time before I dive back in. It's a lot to process, but I'm really glad this game exists, and I'm glad the Greens found the strength to share their story and the help they needed to make it shareable. It's not often I back crowdfunded projects, but I'm glad I helped make this one a reality.","January 12","true","2.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/qcxv/recommended/419460/","qcxv","Glypha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/qcxv/","982 products in account","That Dragon, Cancer has emotional subject matter, but fails to elicit emotion.\n\nThat Dragon, Cancer firstly is not a game, but an 'experience', having few instances with game mechanics, neither of which requires success to advance. Mostly one simply clicks on obvious clickable objects and watches plot unfurl. This is not a deal breaker for me, as I can move past game mechanics to story.  With a story though, the expectation is of a good story. This game fails to deliver in that regard, emotional on the surface, but not eliciting that emotion.\n\nThis failure is in many ways muddled by the nature of the subject matter, childhood cancer, which makes me want to instinctively like it because to not feels like an endorsement of cancer and an attack on the people who made this who experienced a definitively tragic event. However, this is another big problem in the creation of the story. This game was created by people with first hand experience in this regard, but they are also the characters in the game, and they have most clearly written themselves into the game in their best Sunday dress. As a result the game is something of a story retold by the people who experienced it, but viewed through their own distorted views of themselves. No one in this game has any sort of flaw whatsoever, and the closest attempts for the characters to have flaws are laughable, amounting to being despondent in a situation where there is no fault feeling as such. The whitewashing crushes the authenticity that could've existed, had this not been a memoir. The entirety of the narration lacked a human feel to it, and made me feel all the worse for not connecting to them as the main character is a cancer patient.\n\nAnother issue is that one of the central arcs of this game is of Christian responses to crisis. I am not religious, nor am I vehement against it. It feels as though I should at least not be against the theme, because to feel so feels like an aspersion on Christianity, but the theme was poorly thought out and written.  Occasionally, the use feels much like a sermon. I don't require characters to forsake their religion, and it is perfectly fine to be a useful coping mechanism, but it fails as a core game mechanic, serving mostly to deflect the very mortal concepts that would be the story's potential strength. It is alienating, and nothing inspiring came from it.\n\nThe artistic feel of the game is bland, and much in the game looked like painted wood with occasional real images jarringly inserted into this world. There are no faces in this game, which is understandable as it would be almost impossible to effectively communicate emotion with such faces, but it is symbolic of how this game fails to communicate emotion. The music in the game does not inspire or reinforce the emotions the game is trying to elicit, and is not noteworthy, which given the emotional nature of the game and that music can elicit, is a shame.\n\nIn the end my emotional response to this game was feeling bad that I didn't feel something from this game, but feeling like I shouldn't criticize it because of what it is. That is not indicative of a quality experience, and at a hefty price tag (15$ as of this writing), that is a very difficult sell, as this game is also quite short.

Horrible controls and bland (here comes the hate) story about a kid that dies from cancer and his parents struggle, and capatalism of this event. $15 is too much for this game, after reading countless reviews I had high expectations.  The game is on rails, the controls suck, and if your not religious you may even be offened at the content.\n\n\nInstead of buying this you will get more out of watching these movies:\n\n\n1. "Wit" Starring Emma Thompson, this movie is about a powerful and feared scholar who is diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer.\n\n2.\n"Stepmom" In this movie about cancer, Susan Sarandon plays a mom who is dying of cancer. Julia Roberts plays the stepmom who has to step in and help take care of her husband's kids.\n\n3.\n"Crazy Sexy Cancer" This is a documentary cancer movie featuring actress Kris Carr who turns the cameras on herself as she goes through the experience of being diagnosed with an incurable form of cancer.\n\n4.\n"The Bucket List" You really can't go wrong with Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson. The two star in this cancer movie about two men who meet in a cancer ward and go through a list of things they want to do before they die.\n\n5.\n"Love Story" This is an older cancer movie, but it is still one of the best. Ryan O'Neil and Ali McGraw play a husband and wife who have to deal with her cancer diagnosis and death.\n\n6.\n"Brians Song" Another older cancer movie, this film about two Chicago Bears players and their friendship that is not only the first white-black friendship in sports, but also how Gale Sayers stands by Brian Piccolo when he is diagnosed with cancer.\n\n7.\n"Dying Young" Campbell Scott plays a young wealthy man with leukemia who hires Julia Roberts to take care of him in this cancer movie. The two end up falling in love as they are secluded during his chemotherapy.\n\n8.\n"Life as a House" Kevin Kline  is diagnosed with terminal cancer in this cancer movie. His diagnoses leads him to build a house on his land that is on the Pacific Ocean as he tries to connect with his son before he dies.\n\n9.\n"Letters to God" This is a true story about Tyler Doherty, an eight year old boy who has brain cancer. In this cancer movie, God becomes his pen pal as he writes and mails letters to him every day.\n\n10.\n"One More Kiss" A woman with terminal cancer returns to her former lover in Scotland to try and recapture the joy she once had.","February 16","false","2.3"," 20 of 46 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","20","46","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hypeserver/recommended/419460/","hypeserver","hypeserver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hypeserver/","383 products in account","THE BAD:\n\nAs a few others have already touched on, about half way through, this game HEAVILY touches on the idea of religion and God. As someone who doesn't necessarily believe in this faith, it makes it extremely hard to continue with the story.\n\nThe voice acting is relatively bad and downright awful at points. There are a few times where the narration gets so over done you can actually hear the *crackle* of the recording microphone. In a game/story so heavily focused on narration you think this would be better done.\n\nThe controls are clunky and annoying. You shouldn't have to click on the screen five times just to walk in the same direction another five feet.\n\nThe price. This has been mentioned in pretty much any negative review about this game. Since I dropped $15 on this game, I'd expect that there would be some warning about the religious overtones. The description simply suggests that the game explores themes of faith, but it doesn't talk about the fact that a rather large part of the dialogue becomes about religion and God.\n\nTHE GOOD:\nHonestly? Not a lot. I really wanted to love this game. To me, this game was very personal. When I was fourteen my father passed away from colon cancer. As someone who has watched a family member suffer, endure, and then become the victim of such a horrible disease, I expected this story to be very relatable. When you make a game/story about a touchy subject, such as cancer, you really need to make sure you do it justice.\n\nThat being said, there are parts of this game/story that are truly beautiful. Some of the metaphors are spot on when it comes to what the family's of cancer patients are feeling. The story also tries it's best to replicate what cancer patients are feeling as they go through the game. This gets to be an even touchier subject. How can you make a game/story off of the assumptions of how a cancer patient is feeling? Did I really have to be forced to listen to the main narrator sing "God loves Joel" for a good five minutes? What is the point?\n\nFor a game that is supposed to be focused on family, cancer, and the entire journey it is EXTREMELY focused on religion. Seriously, I honestly can NOT stress this enough. This game is 100% biased and 100% a religious story. The bible is quoted numerous times and there was one part where the word 'God' is said around fifteen times in the same paragraph.\n\nMy regret? Not reading the reviews before I bought this game, story, whatever you want to call it. I really wish I could go back in time and get my 1.6 hours back. I get that it's supposed to be a personal story, but if you're going to make a religious game and not warn your buyers....well, that's kind of a ♥♥♥♥ move.","March 21","false","1.6"," 26 of 59 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","26","59","0","6"

On one hand there is a very difficult story that I knew would be hard to deal with, I can't imagine the heartache of going through this.  It must be hell.  But on the other I felt like I'd been battered around the head with the Jesus stick.  While I believe that this game is a triumph when it comes to dealing with loss and tragedy, it became too unbearable to deal with the constant references to God.  While games like "Everybody's gone to the rapture" deal with personal belief, I never felt burdened with it.  Here it becomes icky...  There isn't another word for it.  It's like sitting in a room with someone telling you about salvation while you make a conscious decision never to visit that person again.\n\nSadly I wont be going on with the game.  I will defend personal faith and everybody’s right to practice it.\n\nI have nothing but praise for the game makers for making such a personal and moving game, but I felt so uncomfortable.

All parents I feel are haunted by the fear, irrational or not, that their child may die. And I wanted to know what Ryan Green, the creator of this game, had to say about his lost son Joel.\n\nWas I touched by this game? Yes.\nDid it drive me to tears? Yes.\nDid I miss Joel by the end? Yes, and I think you will too.\n\nBut let's be honest here, this game is being published on Steam as a game. Is it a commercial release? No. Is it an art game? Yes. It has a message and a point it wants to drive home. But honestly, this game is almost utterly devoid of gameplay whatsoever. And the little existing gameplay is frustrating, hard to interpret, and repetitive. Is it a good game? No.\n\nThe game has essentially been constructed as a linear walkthrough of several mnemonic palaces or rooms. The player is herded from point to point, triggering memories, sound clips, letters, experiences with Joel. It is certainly touching, but also excruciatingly boring at times. The interface is so minimalist that it drives you to spam clicking, hoping an action will be triggered. Part of this is deliberate, since the game is communicating Ryan and Amy's frustration and lack of power, there is no question about that. However, it is also true that the game is asking to be treated like a game, and as such it should be judged on its own merits and demerits. The fact of the matter is that the clunky controls, linearity, and lack of clear direction distract the player and detract from the greater purpose.\n\nI think Ryan and Amy deserve sympathy for suffering through Joel's death after a long, frustrating, and painful battle with terminal disease.  But they also deserve praise for the love they displayed by memorializing Joel's brief life. They also showed courage by bearing their own raw grief in a way that is unprecedented for games and may also be unprecedented in other media. People will remember this game for its originality of concept, its tenderness, and for the fact that it was a labor of love, a heartbreaking commemoration of a life barely lived. Because the game delivers such a powerful message of loss, Joel too will be remembered and missed by everyone who plays this.\n\nI'd recommend this game, especially the scene where Joel will not stop crying late into the night, to young single people who haven't yet experienced the intense love a parent feels for a child. It will put you in that place mentally where all of us parents have been, and I would say that it is the game's strongest scene. I wish Ryan and Amy all the best.","January 12","true","1.6"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

I've only made it through a few of the scenes, but I can tell that this is going to be a heart-breaking, painful story to follow- especially after reading the background of the couple who endured this story.\n\nMany comments and reviews have questioned why someone would sell this game, not give the money to charity/research, etc. These questions can be answered by having empathy for the creator and his wife, the parents of the child displayed in this story. Not only do medical bills pile up, but also to continue making this game and deal with the grief of losing their son, this family lived off of savings for several months to finish this game, this masterpiece, to help not only themselves, but also (hopefully) others through the loss of a child in this manner.\n\nThe score of background music fits so well with the scenes of the game. The narration feels real and the script is on point. The mechanics of the game are easy to follow and smooth, not much thought process in the beginning (again, I haven't played through), as most is explore, point, and click. The colors, sounds, and overall feelings of each scene are truly cathartic and calming at some points.\n\nI highly recommend "That Dragon, Cancer" to anyone who is looking for something with true meaning, something that is mechanically easy, and something that will allow them to go down a slide as many times as they want with no time constraint or urgent mission to accomplish.\n\nThis is a game that I cannot wait to finish, then play again throughout my life. This memoir is beautiful and reminiscent of "Death be not Proud", one of my favorite books.","January 12","true","2.5"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

It was a bit oversold.  This is an interactive story about loss, and not much of a game.\n\nThe story contains several powerful moments and some well thought-out representations of human experiences.  It has technical glitches and all of the hallmarks of an indie project.\n\nI am recommending this more because of the pioneering use of this medium to communicate a human experience to a mainstream audience.  It's worth catching a glimpse of what is possible if more game designers follow the lead of Ryan and Amy, as well as companies like Frictional and others, and build worlds that don't involve non-stop violence at all.  Such worlds will tell stories, human stories.  The potential to teach and share is limitless, particularly as the technology improves and accessibility of production tools improves.\n\nUnfortunately, the authors made a deliberate decision to include a rather unsubtle Christian narrative.

It was a bit oversold.  This is an interactive story about loss, and not much of a game.\n\nThe story contains several powerful moments and some well thought-out representations of human experiences.  It has technical glitches and all of the hallmarks of an indie project.\n\nI am recommending this more because of the pioneering use of this medium to communicate a human experience to a mainstream audience.  It's worth catching a glimpse of what is possible if more game designers follow the lead of Ryan and Amy, as well as companies like Frictional and others, and build worlds that don't involve non-stop violence at all.  Such worlds will tell stories, human stories.  The potential to teach and share is limitless, particularly as the technology improves and accessibility of production tools improves.\n\nUnfortunately, the authors made a deliberate decision to include a rather unsubtle Christian narrative.  It is both boring and alienating.  I recommend the authors consider including a "secular" and/or "non-denominational" switch.

I've done my best to be as non-spoilery as possible but please read cautiously! Same for the comments! Thank you to the person who kindly let me know what's up!**\n\nWith a distinctly different style of narrative gameplay that often feels purely as if you are sitting in the corner of someone's mind as they grieve, That Dragon, Cancer takes you right into the lives of the Greens as they progress through their son, Joel's, cancer diagnosis. This isn't a game. This is a hand in hand experience of pain, grief, hope, and faith. It is not easy to play this. It holds back nothing, exposing the raw emotions of both parents.\n\nI cried.\n\nBut That Dragon, Cancer is not about making you grieve. The Greens didn't aim for that. You get to know Joel. You get to hear snippets of a family still trying to go on even when it seems so hard. You hear laughter. You hear songs sung and silly impersonations in the back of a car on a long road trip to hoping it'll be okay one day.\n\n\nI feel like at the end of That Dragon, Cancer, both you and the Greens, are going to be okay one way or another.  You go through it together and you feel like they're much stronger by the end of it. At least you hope so.\n\n\nHere is part one of my time with Joel and his family.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqevb2FPr_4","January 12","true","2.0"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","7","21","3","4"

Interactive experiences like this are a new art form that deserve support, but not all experiments bear fruit.\n\nHere's what I liked in no particular order:\n\n1) Nice music, although it got a bit repetitive at times.\n\n2) When viewed from a distance, the abstract human figures looked quite nice.\n\n3) Some of the fanatasy imagry was beautiful. I particualrly liked to see balloons carry Joel ride on constellations come to  life.\n\n4) The cancer ward filled with cards was simple but devastatingly effective. It conveyed how many people had fought to live in those halls.\n\n5) A lot of Ryan's narration was quite moving. I wish we had been "in his head" the whole game. I thought the episode where he's trying to get Joel to settle down was well done. It wasn't a bug that Joel was invisible -right? I was able to empathize with Joel much more in that scene than I could at most other times...\n\nHere is what I disliked:\n\n1) The abstact character models were a big, big, turn-off for me when viewed close-up. Whenever I was forced to get physically close to Joel, I was repulsed. I was acutely aware that this thing in front of me was just a collection of polygons, and it just felt "wrong" to pretend I was playing with a real toddler. The fact that this was all based on a little kid that had really died made things even worse. I would be as if someone made a doll that looked like Joel and expected me to pretend that lifeless, inert doll was a a living, breathing child.\n\n2) The controls were frustrating. I get that the creators wanted to limit interactivity to help maintain the tone they wanted and to focus the narrative. However, there are better ways to do that which don't have me constantly wondering where I'm allowed to click or what I have to click before I can procede. This might have been less of an issue if there weren't parts of the game that I disliked and wanted to get through ASAP. Still, any time that I'm thinking of how to get through the game as a GAME means I'm stepping back from being immersed in the experience you're trying to create.\n\n3) On that note, the driving and platforming mini-games were clumsy and un-fun.  I enjoyed break from the monotony of click-hunting, but you have a problem when you need mini-games to distract from the tedium of your core gameplay.\n\n4) The one place the clicking around really grated on me was when you're fluttering around the ocean filled with bottles. I didn't know where I had to go and got frustrated.\n\n5) This might seem cruel, but I didn't like Amy's voicework or what she had to say. Because of that, it was a real chore to have to listen to all of those bottles filled with her letters. Her stuff seemed very one-note to me while Ryan had more of an arc. It also seemed like we didn't see her worry, suffer, and grieve as intimately as we saw Ryan do all of those things. I recogize that she doesn't have to do so the same way or as visibly as he does, but it seemed like everything we saw of her was through the lens of her religion while Ryan was more human and nuanced.\n\nThis whole review probably comes off as cruel, but I feel like a public work of art deserves public critcism. If Ryan or Amy ever read this, wish you all the best and commend you for your courage in making this game.","January 15","false","2.0"," 29 of 68 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","29","68","2","0"

It is deeply personal and a powerful example of how video games as a medium can be used not only for pleasure but also for exposure. Cancer is a topic shied away from all too often. This art game serves as a great example to educate through empathy. The despair felt by this family is raw as this game was produced during their son Joel's passing and acts very much as a eulogy and celebration of life. There are pacing issues throughout, especially one scene where Joel is crying toward the last third of the game; however, I almost prefer it this way as it very much reflects the situation's helplessness. Religion also plays a central role that while may seem off-putting for some; it offers a genuine documentary experience of how they coped with a terrible loss through faith. It was an emotional journey and I definitely recommend to all interested in seeing how games as a medium can be utilized to tell impactful stories.","January 12","true","1.6"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

I've cried during games before, but it's always been inside a crafted narrative, played out by fictional characters, and that facet of "this is fake" was always in the back of my mind. In contrast, That Dragon, Cancer is less performance (I think that as a game, performance is a necessary part) and more conversation. Human to human. It felt like Ryan, Amy, and their family were not just telling but showing me their story, in the way that only visual media can. And I was there, crying and laughing along with them, like we were old friends.\n\nIt's small in scope as games go, but the striking, hyper-realistic audio coupled with the minimalist UI and low-poly visuals creates a quick sense of immersion. At once both vivid and dreamlike, mirroring the emotional state of Ryan and Amy. And in the first 20-30 minutes, I reached that place too. I felt like I was walking along with them all the way until The End, about 160 minutes in my playthrough.\n\nI ran into a couple bugs that were annoying enough to warrant mention. I had to restart a chapter because the scripting broke, there was a voicemail I couldn't click, and a single letter played at 10% volume relative to the others. Annoying not in their own right but because I wanted so much for this story to play how it was intended. I will note though that I was immersed again within minutes, and the bugs ultimately didn't take anything away from the story.\n\nIf you're interested in That Dragon, Cancer, then you probably know at least a little bit about it, and I'm not going to spoil anything. Just buy it and play it, alone or with a loved one. It's a tragic and hopeful human story. It's not about the glorious triumph of faith, it's about the endurance of faith even when it's seemingly failed. It's gorgeous, moving, and well-told. There are scenes that will be with me for awhile, and I'm glad for that.

From the beginning we learn to understand who Joel is and and care for him, this makes the games impacts so much more heartbreaking when you hear the inevitable news and the frustration that this family had to bear through. To hear the pain in their voices, and to see it shared in letters of love from so many others that this game has displayed is touching. To lose a loved one, to hold onto hope and life, and find a new semblence of meaning in all the madness. This game bravely shows both the harsh and beautiful truths of life through creative gameplay; each scene allowing us to explore and break away to the next step. There are scenes of symbolism where you want to hold on to hear just a little bit more, until you've heard it all enough and sit back only to have that be the cue for the camera to move to the next page of the story.\n\nThis game will guide you through it, and not once will you want to look away. The passion and love behind this project is pronounced in every scene, and I absolutely lost it when reading the letter of the little girl who played Legends of Terris as her escape from her pain. I am so glad to have been able to play this game, and hear this story and gain a new perspective on life and the struggle others are going through right now. I'm glad that someone made a game that hits right to the core through emotional story telling, fantastic music, and visual metaphors that remind you of what is coming. Throughout the entire game, you know what is coming; and the parents of this boy are taking you on their journey with them.\n\nI want to applaud the developers; you have made a work of art, and a tribute to so many others in this game. This is the passion, and the soul of the art form that video games deserve. The ability to tell stories and invest the player in them through gameplay was masterfully done. I highly recommend this game for anyone wishing to experience insight, or for anyone who has lost a loved one to cancer. This is a project of passion, and a tribute of love to those who have passed. I am glad the developers chose to have shared this with us, making this game to them must not have been easy. You have touched me as a gamer, and as an aspiring designer. I hope this game receives widespread recognition, it is a perfect example of the kind of story and emotions that this art form can imbue.

If religious discussion bothers you, I suppose it might put you off, but it's not there to preach to anyone, it's just a powerful underpinning of the way in which this family tried to approach coping with something that most of us can't really imagine (and will hopefully never experience).\n\nIt is challenging to experience, even from the position of outsider looking in. It was a brave thing to commit these experiences to any medium and turn them loose in the world. I hope it was healing, too. By the end of it I couldn't keep the tears at bay, but it was so, so comforting to see the credits at the end, and the long--long, long--list of backers from the kickstarter campaign...all those people who rallied behind the story of one family (which is, in its way, the story of many families).","January 13","true","2.7"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. ***\n\n'That Dragon, Cancer' is one of those games that I don't think I could recommend easily, because it lacks in actual gameplay. If you're into games of this genre, then Yes. Definitely play this game. The little gameplay to be found is made up with enthralling moments, amazing story-telling, incredible art and sound, and probably one of the best stories I've read/experienced in some time.\n\nYou 'play' as Ryan Green, the father of a young baby named Joel that has cancer. You experience the lives of Ryan, Amy & Joel during this period in their lives, from their amazing highs (playing in the park, feeding ducks, 'leaving the hospital' party) to their dreaded lows (conversation with doctor, final moments with Joel). The experience is truly something worthwhile.\n\nThat being said, for me personally, I did not particularly enjoy the ocean/drowning section of the game, when Ryan seems to go on a lot about God & Jesus. I understand that this was Ryan's way of dealing/coping; I am fine with that, I have nothing against it. My problem is, it pulls you away slightly from the immersion of a father trying to enjoy the last moments he has with his son, and it becomes more about him justifying having faith when he didn't before.\n\nAgain, I'm not bashing it; if that's what he used to help him get through those last few days, I wholly understand why. I just think that it pulled away from what made the game great FOR ME. The ending, however, is probably one of the best endings I've experienced in some time; seeing Joel with the puppy and the pancakes made me grin from ear to ear.\n\nAll in all, I loved this game. It was worth every penny. The game has as much replayability as watching a movie, in my opinion. I hope we see more games like this is in the future, because they're incredible when done right.\n\nAnd 'That Dragon, Cancer'?

The turn speed needed to be absolutly maxed out to feel anything other than like i was trying to control glacier dad, and even then it wasn't the greatest.  Some of the moments could carry on a bit longer than was abosulty neccessary.  Would I reccomend it....no but that is only for the ♥♥♥♥♥ bucket controls...even the minigames were tolerable....at best.  Also that bit with Joel on the Star Merry goround coulda gone on for about 1/8th as long.  So in summation watch someone play this game. I think you'll get the same feels and ideas that they wanted to say within the game, but without the glacier control scheme, and terrible minigames\n\n","January 15","false","1.5"," 17 of 44 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","17","44","2","0"

And that it is very much an art form in the truest sense of the word when done right. And That Dragon, Cancer gets it right. A narrative-driven game that focuses very much on the story and not the gameplay, That Dragon, Cancer achieves easily what hundreds of games in the past have attempted to achieve. Through a minimalist art design, it retains focus on the narrative itself, which is not only based on but the sole focus of a true story of a family and their battle against the cancer ravaging a young boy.\n\nThe graphics and level design of the game overall magnificently accentuate the thoughts and emotions that the game is attempting to convey. The simplistic gameplay mechanics might seem droll to some at first glance, but this reviewer took it as a way for the game designers to accentuate the age of the child that was the focus of the game, his battle, his family’s titanic struggle, how inspirational the boy had become to so many people.\n\nYou can find my full review here: https://youtu.be/RQzlkV1mb5I","January 13","true","1.8"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","0"

This is more like an interactive movie than a video game, which is not quite what I expected. The story focuses on a child named Joel's fight with cancer. It is an extremely touching story, but with that being said, it is boring. If you want to see the story I would recommend just watching a youtube playthrough. This game would be worth $5, but $15 for a 2 hour movie that you can look around in is way too steep. I was also experiencing glitches that required a restart within 5 minutes. It started with little things like the camera jumping around, but ended with me not being able to move. It did leave me with a different outlook on cancer, which is something that no other game has ever done for me, which is why I gave it a thumbs up.","January 13","true","2.6"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","0"

I'm just stuck looking at the chair in the middle of the room. There seems to be no fix for it, as I've tried restarting the game and also tried replaying through the first two scenes again. It just gets stuck and i have to exit the game. Until that gets fixed, this was a waste of 15 dollars, since it does not work on my screen. I installed it on my roommates computer and it worked fine on his 16:9 display, but i don't have access to his computer constantly.\n\nThis is a warning to those that have 21:9 displays, stay away until they fix this issue. I will update this review accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n****I MANAGED TO FINISH THE GAME, I BORROWED MY ROOMMATES MONITOR FOR THE NIGHT*****\n\nThe following is my review of the actual game itself;\n\nI went into this game expecting to cry a lot. My family is no stranger to cancer. My grandmother was diagnosed with Breast Cancer when I was around 15 years old. She beat it, or so we thought. It reappeared in her lymph nodes when i was 19. By the time I had turned 21, it was back full force. I was away for most of the year after I joined the military, and when I finally came back home, she was no longer the strong woman I once looked up to. She was one of the closest people in my life and the struggle of watching her deteriorate absolutely broke me. There is still a feeling of guilt and remorse to this day for personal reasons I don't wish to divulge. But now my Aunt is also struggling with terminal cancer, she's already living past when the doctors expected. My mother just underwent surgery on her lip for a cancerous group of cells. My grandfather had skin cancer on his nose. My other grandfather battled with prostate cancer. This game was going to hit very hard in a very tender spot for me.\n\nAll that being said, I was crying by the second scene. By the time I hit the scene with all of the cards (you'll see) I was an absolute mess. Tears, snot, shaking uncontrollably, all of it. I had to walk away from the computer for an entire hour to compose myself. It hit too close to home. I couldn't read any more of those god damned cards. By the time I had finished the game, I almost felt a shred of relief. But the credits even got me going again.\n\nThis game also deals with a struggle of faith in christianity, none of which I can personally relate to as I am agnostic. But it might reach out to some of you folks more than it did for me.\n\nAs for the actual game itself, the controls felt a little clunky, and even upping the look sensitivity felt a little too slow still.\n\nThere were quite a few completely unneeded mini-games strewn throughout as well, often not giving you any sort of instructions. I feel that these interrupted the flow of the story being told, and were too distracting. This would function better as an interactive experience instead of feeling like it was forced to have more game like qualities.\n\n\nIn short, I got more than I bargained for in the emotional department.\nThe game tries too hard to be a game sometimes instead of focusing on the storytelling experience.\nOverall, if you enjoy extremely emotional (and true) stories, it's worth playing through. Just be prepared for the occasional mini-game that feels out of place.","January 12","false","2.5"," 150 of 372 people (40%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","40","150","372","19","17"

The story however is very touching, and the game a very interesting style. I was incredibly invested until the entire focus shifted to coping with such a situation through devout Christian religion, and almost half of the play time I found myself alienated and annoyed because of my own beliefs, mainly a tremendous dislike for established religion.\n\nThe ending however brought me back to realizing this was a human story, one we could ultimately all relate to, even if our experiences are vastly different. I thought of the developer, his family, and their bravery for sharing their struggles. Overall I feel a bit more well-rounded for having played, but with money so tight and not enjoying half the game I would have skipped this.

It is a "game" about a child having and dying from cancer. But, they kept asking for it, so when it went on sale, I bought it. I decide I would check it out before telling them. Here is what I learned:\n\nI cried through the whole thing. My husband has been battling stage IV lung cancer since 2012. I write about the journey our family has been on. You have to do something to sort out the emotions you are experiencing, and writing is my gift.\n\nGame development is the gift that Eli's dad has. He has used his gift in an amazing way to share his family's experience with the world. This is an immersive experience, more than a game. It is so real and raw.\n\nSo why would someone want to "relive" the cancer experience through a game, or through any other format for that matter? Because in seeing other people's journies, you discover that you are not alone. One of the interesting things in That Dragon, Cancer, was the different ways that each parent coped. The struggles with faith, the reactions to events. It was beautiful to see that other people have the same questions when they face the Dragon. It is also inspiring to see them overcome.\n\nI have been thinking a lot lately about the phrase, "Walk a mile in my shoes."  Until you do that, you really can't impose your value system on others. There has been criticism in some of the reviews about the amount of God and faith in the game. This bothers me because our society has made God and faith taboo. God is how this family overcame the pain of their son's cancer. God is how our family, and many other families, overcome this Dragon.\n\nI would recommend this game highly. Have a box of Kleenex nearby, though. You will need it.","March 26","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I felt my own heart strings tugging throughtout the game and found myself misty eyed on more than one occasion.\nThat being said, the game has some problems with losing momentum from either lacking a clear direction of what or where to go next to an action that doesn't seem to move the character to the next scene. I grew so frustrated in once scene where the father was swimming, I had to shut the game off.\nI think  if those things were cleared up, theis would be a stellar game.\n\nIf you enjoy a good story( LIke Firewatch for example) and prefer substance over filler then this game is right up your alley.\n\nStephen","March 20","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I can do tell that this is a very personal way to tell a story, a story that based on a true family. Green family. Their thoughts, their dreams and their tragedy.\n\nAn experience I will never forget, nor you if you choose to dive inside it. You will dive and you won't have any control on your way to the button. You will feel full, grateful and sad.\n\n"That Dragon, Cancer" gave me an opportunity to respect what I have during an experience where you can get to see a glimpse of Green family during Joel's cancer fight.\n\nI don't think "That Dragon, Cancer" is suitable for everyone. I do recommend it if you feel a self control or if you confident that you can understand tough things. Because maybe what a 17-18 human being can understand, a 15 can't. And I am talking specifically about "That Dragon, Cancer". This experience is full of scenes that I can't even describe how well delivered they are.\n\nAlso, there is a documentary movie about the creation of the game, while covering Greens family as well.

It's an interesting game; it's contemplative and heartbreaking and moving and entirely worth playing, but it’s definitely not “fun.” That being said, I would recommend this game for anyone who is interested in stories, and who would be interested in experiencing an emotional, interactive and immersive form of storytelling.\n\nThere is religious content in this game: the family is Christian, and their faith is part of their story. As someone who is not religious—not even spiritual, really—I was worried that I might be turned off or be unable to relate to the story because of it. However, even though faith plays heavily in the game, I never felt like I was being preached to. I was immersed in their story, and experiencing their thoughts, fears and prayers as they dealt with a truly awful situation.\n\nI will say that the controls weren’t always intuitive feeling, and there were a few places where the pacing didn’t quite work for me, but overall, I am glad I played this game.

But if you definitely want to cry about something so emotionally touching and as sad as that Dragon, Cancer I would give it a shot. Probably the downside? It's mostly an interactive movie (again, I don't mind, the art and graphics are amazing) and it's a bit short. I clocked in about 2 hours and completely moved me.

This game has a couple frustrating things mentioned in some other reviews, but overall the story telling is worth the price in my mind. Here are some pros and cons [Spoilers].\n\nPros:\n-The atmoshpere and lighting throughout most of the game really enhances the story telling\n-Most of the voice acting throughout the game is good quality, and holds with the above\n-This game made me actually feel genuine sorrow for Joel and his family, not many games do that anymore\n-The art in many levels is amazing for the polygonal style that was chosen (more in cons)\n-Towards the end when they give the bad news about Joels cancer, it talks about how the doctors and people who helped feel genuine sadness about not being able to help Joel, and gives you insight into what they thought\n-Pancake parties... need I say more?\n\nCons:\n-The art in other sections of the game did feel like there could be more detail, but it did not impede the gameplay\n-The game sometimes made me do an option or two twice and played the same dialog before furthering the story, maybe just a bug, but was slightly imersion breaking\n-Towards the ending it gets REALLY religious on the parents part, which in a smaller dose would have been fine, since many people turn to religion in grief, but by the end I found myself wishing to just get through the references already\n\nHonestly, through out the story, it holds true to what the story is about, a family trying their hardest to help their young son fight his battle with cancer. You will probably get the feels.","January 15","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is also a vessel for carrying messages and artwork from many other people, who backed the project on Kickstarter and decided to share their own losses and stories.\n\nWhether this is a game or not is not very relevant. Let's just say it's an interactive experience in the form (or format) of a video game... Know this: instead of walking freely, you click on clearly indicated hotspots and navigate between fixed waypoints where you can freely look around. There are no puzzles and it takes roughly 2 hrs to play through. There is replay value if you go back and read all the messages, study the artwork etc.\n\nIf you think you can't handle the emotional content in this game - it's actually not as sad or depressing as you may think. There is playfulness and laughter here too, surrealistic dreamlike sequences and a few bittersweet minigames. If you feel any of the vignettes is too heavy to handle, you can quickly press Esc and switch to another chapter.\n\nThe Green family are Christians and that is mirrored in how they are coping with hardship and tragedy, but they are not trying to preach or convert you. Rather, this is their very personal struggle with faith and doubt, hope and despair. In the game, the couple are even quarreling over how to handle their emotions and beliefs.\n\nRyan & Amy Green, their kids and their small dev team deserve all the love of the gaming community for daring to share their life and loss in this way.

I knew I would need to approach slowly and methodically, understanding what this game really was. That Dragon Cancer is a memoir to the passing of a real life child named Joel Green who was afflicted with cancer. He died at 5 years old, too young and too short a life by any imaginable standard. His parents Ryan and Amy Green created this game as a tribute, a diary, and a message of who Joel was and as a reflection of what he had to endure at such a young age. While I knew what to expect from the game from the moment of its inception, I never truly knew how affecting it would be until the credits rolled. I truly have not played or experienced a work of art quite like this because it his almost wholly unique. This game lies on a plane beyond gruff action protagonists, high score chasing and the pursuit of dominance or “bad-assery” that the majority of the game industry covets and chases at all costs. It is personal at the highest level, a bittersweet invitation into the hardship and inevitability of a real life struggle that the Green family and numerous others around the world have and continue to face every single day. It’s an in-depth look at the role of faith and God in the lives of everyday people, and how it brings reflection and comfort in the most difficult of times. And while this remains a review of the game you’ll be receiving, it’s also a hesitant, judgment-free and meticulously gentle word to compliment the immense payoff you’ll receive from playing the game.\n\nPresentation:\nThe game has a simplistic and geometric visual style grounded in abstract expression. Many of the textures and details are purposely omitted in favor of primary colors to express concepts and ideas. The visuals evoke many of the games deeply human concepts effortlessly, whether it be mentally in the minds of Ryan, Amy or Joel, or through the depiction of a story accompanied through dialogue and more. Even the digital forms on screen are simple in design but effective enough to know exactly what you are looking at. The music is non-intrusive, harmonious and decisively melancholic, allowing you to get lost in the flowing of emotion on-screen and within ourselves. Even the dialogue spoken by characters is distinctly soft, but poignant due to the subject matter. It’s clear the aesthetics were designed solely so you could get lost in the spirally roller coaster of Joel’s battle with cancer, from his initial diagnosis and all events proceeding it. The games presentation is so hard hitting and vividly affecting because it is all real. These are digital recreations of real events and the thoughts within the Green family’s minds. This is not a video game with a fictional premise or epic narrative. It’s a family surviving the most difficult moment life can bear: the inevitable and helpless loss of a child. Every narrative moment and dialogue delivery held my attention with utmost respect and complicity because I knew these events actually happened. Every moment felt like I had payed to get a personal glimpse into the most haunting and excruciating moment in the Green family’s life, which gave me pause every time the thought crossed my mind.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay, outside of a few sections, continues the trend of non-intrusive interaction. Relying almost entirely of pointing on objects and directions to proceed for the next piece of narrative. The game will often let you interact with its world and writings, but almost always in limited fashion to advance the story. It is purposely minimal in scope and practice, which suits it because it’s difficult to imagine a single genre that could adequately encapsulate and push forward this tale by mere gameplay alone. The game has some diversity in various sections that work beautifully as game-driven storytelling. It has a driving section in the Green’s home where you briefly take a third person driving view within Joel’s wonderful imagination. There is a simple side-scrolling section with a few enemies and the head of a dragon which match a somber story being told to Joel with cancer as this powerful dragon that many of tried to conquer, to no avail. These are mostly solid, but there are times where it feels like the game was grasping at straws trying to find something interactive to do to fill its gameplay sections, even though I would have been fine simply existing in this space as a bystander and not sticking to normal game conventions in this case. Everything fits well in the context of Joel’s imagination though and these sequences often gave us a breath of air in a deeply reflective and contemplative experience, showing how at the darkest of times humans must sometimes retreat and engage our imaginations to escape a terrifying reality. That Dragon Cancer nails this feeling at almost every turn.\n\nOverall Value:\nOnce again, I’m floored at how I feel I must construct this section of the review differently. Value is a very strange metric to measure, since its objective nature leaves it on a person-by-person basis. The game retails for $15 for about 2 hours of game, which is a price/length ratio that has been criticized heavily in the past. However, I believe the subject matter, personal nature of the family’s struggle and general unique atmosphere and drama of the title lends it weight that few other games have ever matched. The price feels like a mere inconvenience in all honesty, a simple step you engage in to gain access to the work and I paid without a second thought merely due to my desire to view their experience close up. You could easily do research on the Internet to find out Joel’s ultimate fate or watch a Let’s Play and save the money, however there is something about supporting the family and viewing it in my own way that was extremely important to me. Objectively though, the game admittedly offers minimal gameplay and interaction, with only a few sections to speak of on that front, with the rest offering a viewing experience or clicking on papers to read with voiceovers. Gamers who focus heavily on gameplay will likely not be satisfied with what’s on offer, however lovers of narrative driven experiences with gameplay as a simple tool to experience the world will love this title. This title will be poignant in the highest regard to players whose friends or own families have been affected by the wide reaching effects of cancer in real life and to those people, it will likely be a quicker decision.\n\nVerdict:\nThat Dragon Cancer is a very special and personal game. No other video game I’ve ever played has ever given such a blunt and harrowing view into the lives of real people. Often times it feels like the player is opening the diary of the family and peering into the darkest recesses of their hopes and fears, all as they fight and eventually accept the ultimate fate of their child. While terribly sad, it also shows the incredible power of hope and how faith can give us strength in impossible circumstances. Engaging with that sense of inevitability and powerlessness is ultimately this game’s most superb yet surreal achievement. The visuals are simple but effective enough to serve the purpose the game is trying to fulfill. Gameplay purists may leave the title with buyer’s remorse, but that may likely be overridden with the other gifts the game can provide. This game will truly offer very different things to different audiences, something powerful that cannot be fully valued. For me, I also leave the experience with a sense of pride in the game industry I haven’t felt in years, learning the lengths that games continue to strive towards to provide artistic experiences. If art is meant to touch the soul of a person and make them reflect on their life, That Dragon Cancer may be one of the finest examples of art our medium has.","January 25","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Make no mistake, you will cry. You will smile. You will despair, but you will also hope just as these people did. There's no point in rating this game, because you can't rate something so personal.

The closest experience I've had in a game was probably the Stanley Parable, but unlike the Stanley Parable, this game is pretty much a linear narrative. It's probably more correct to call it an 'interactive story' than a game as games are usually known for. This is important to know, because if you approach this game as a gamer expecting well-designed mini-games to tell this story, you're probably going to be disappointed.\n\nIf you approach this as an interactive story, it's a lot better. The experience reminds me of the interactive experiences you can have on VR headsets like the Google Goggles. It's scripted, but you get some enjoyment from the autonomy of perspective that you choose by looking around.\n\nOnto the story itself: this is the probably the best part of this game. It's based on real life, and the interactivity provides an immersion and intimacy to the struggle of the Greens as they battle cancer together with their son. Like many other players, I was in tears for much of the game. The strength of the interactivity helps you get into the shoes of the Greens, and it's this second-person perspective that makes the game such a powerful experience.\n\nRegarding the Christian parts mentioned in the game: yes, if you do not come from a Christian background, you might find the Christian content offputting. But for many people of any creed, their religion will be a part of their philosophical struggle when they have to confront the death of loved ones. One can find empathy in the pain and difficulty of accepting the death of loved ones, no matter whether you believe in a god or not. Approaching it this way, perhaps a non-Christian can identify with the basic human desire to see their loved ones alive and well.\n\nI'm divided about the graphics. I didn't really like the faceless human models, but I loved the use of light and colour for the scenery. I think I generally found the visuals and imagery beautiful and striking, and combined with the moving soundtrack, this game was generally a positive experience.\n\nHowever, I wish that the controls were less finicky and didn't depend on point-and-click. I would have preferred a WASD free movement, similar to FPSs, with E to interact with surroundings. The best references I can think of for fluid environmental interaction and being guided on a rail while providing the illusion of free movement are Half-Life 2 and The Stanley Parable, both based on the Source Engine.\n\nMy overall conclusion:\nPros: Powerful story, striking visuals, moving music.\nCons: Did not like point-and-click controls, polygon models a bit too rough for me.\nCaveats: Must be aware of Christian content and  nature of gameplay before buying so you know what to expect.\n\nThank you for reading. Overall it's still a Yes for me.","January 24","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The beautifully innovated scenery, music, and characterisation of the family was breathtaking. I did read a view of the reviews whilst hte game was downloading, and saw the mention of religion.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/perrypiper/recommended/419460/","perrypiper","FarewellVHS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/perrypiper/","158 products in account","That Dragon, Cancer will likely be cited in the future of interactive media, not for being amazing, but for being one of the first to tackle more mainstream issues that we see more in film and novels.This is an experimental game / experience that presents the emotions and journey of the Green family through their son Joel's battle with cancer. It has zero replayability except to show it to others and lasts 2-3 hours. A scene in the middle, dehydration, is one I never want to experience again. Joel is screaming and crying in pain for several minutes on end.\n\nI don't have kids, but I'd imagine this game to heartbreaking or near impossible to play for parents. People I've mentioned the project to have been blown away it's even being tackled as a "game," whatever that means or might mean in the future, if we begin calling such experiences as some other name.\n\nThe game is very approachable in terms of its controls. It plays like a Qaunatic Dream production like Heavy Rain or Beyond Two Souls, where your cursor's actions change based on context, but much less complex than those games. People have complained about clunky controls or not knowing "what to do" to complete each scene, but this is trying to convey feelings and is less of a game with levels. The game provides clear cues as to what is happening and I never got stuck. Some parts in the middle of the game present what is I'm assuming to be artwork and letters to and from other sick kids ot members of their families. So this isn't just Joel's story, but a collection for many families and future kids with cancer and other terminal illnesses.\n\nI can see people getting a bit angry at the comparison between the temple of man and the temple of God. The implication is that the Green family or perhaps mostly Ryan sort of scoffs at people deciding to use medicene to heal people, since in his world view this seems to be a kind of arrogance because God is who heals, not man with his weak collection of machines. But that is common among religious people to sort of dislike science and scientists, although of course that doesn't apply to everyone.\n\nI grew up in the Christian faith for 18 years and was confirmed, as were many people but I'm no longer religious. So I understand where they're coming from. Amy and Ryan conflict about how to handle grief and what to expect will happen to Joel and how God should answer their prayers. Obviously non religious people will see this as delusional. Replace God with Aliens and flying saucers and we can start a comparison. But people of faith will likely keep believing no matter what happens or what new evidence they see. It's very deep for them and there is a lot hanging on religious ideas, like keeping alive the place where deceased relatives live. The thought of friends and family possibly dying forever, as Ryan fears insignificance, is too terrifying for most to even acknowledge as a possibility, so heaven and all its implications of god such teachings MUST be true and fought for being proven true forever.\n\nThis game is not jamming beliefs at anyone, it contains a family's experience of a terrible situation and I think everyone can relate to it. There are terribly sad moments, but also joyful ones. Near the end, a pheonix is presented on the floor of a grand cathedral, which I think is a unifying message. One that we all can rise up from bad events. It doesn't matter what we believe.","January 22","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/myronde/recommended/419460/","myronde","bumps","http://steamcommunity.com/id/myronde/","43 products in account","Battling cancer is a story that has been told through other media, but That Dragon, Cancer is the first I can think of that has elected to use an interactive game as the medium of choice.\n\nFirst off, for those who are still wondering whether they should still buy the game: if the kinds of games you're used to are games heavy on  mechanics like MOBAs, RPGs, FPSs, and RTSs, this isn't really that kind of game. The closest experience I've had in a game was probably the Stanley Parable, but unlike the Stanley Parable, this game is pretty much a linear narrative. It's probably more correct to call it an 'interactive story' than a game as games are usually known for. This is important to know, because if you approach this game as a gamer expecting well-designed mini-games to tell this story, you're probably going to be disappointed.\n\nIf you approach this as an interactive story, it's a lot better. The experience reminds me of the interactive experiences you can have on VR headsets like the Google Goggles. It's scripted, but you get some enjoyment from the autonomy of perspective that you choose by looking around.\n\nOnto the story itself: this is the probably the best part of this game. It's based on real life, and the interactivity provides an immersion and intimacy to the struggle of the Greens as they battle cancer together with their son. Like many other players, I was in tears for much of the game. The strength of the interactivity helps you get into the shoes of the Greens, and it's this second-person perspective that makes the game such a powerful experience.\n\nRegarding the Christian parts mentioned in the game: yes, if you do not come from a Christian background, you might find the Christian content offputting. But for many people of any creed, their religion will be a part of their philosophical struggle when they have to confront the death of loved ones. One can find empathy in the pain and difficulty of accepting the death of loved ones, no matter whether you believe in a god or not. Approaching it this way, perhaps a non-Christian can identify with the basic human desire to see their loved ones alive and well.\n\nI'm divided about the graphics. I didn't really like the faceless human models, but I loved the use of light and colour for the scenery. I think I generally found the visuals and imagery beautiful and striking, and combined with the moving soundtrack, this game was generally a positive experience.\n\nHowever, I wish that the controls were less finicky and didn't depend on point-and-click. I would have preferred a WASD free movement, similar to FPSs, with E to interact with surroundings. The best references I can think of for fluid environmental interaction and being guided on a rail while providing the illusion of free movement are Half-Life 2 and The Stanley Parable, both based on the Source Engine.\n\nMy overall conclusion:\nPros: Powerful story, striking visuals, moving music.\nCons: Did not like point-and-click controls, polygon models a bit too rough for me.\nCaveats: Must be aware of Christian content and  nature of gameplay before buying so you know what to expect.\n\nThank you for reading. Overall it's still a Yes for me.","January 24","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With every sound and visual cue, we're given tiny pieces of a story that is carefully crafted to ensure that the weight of the situation is conveyed to the audience.\n\nI very rarely play games that have me so emotionally invested that I cry actual tears.

Many people who deal with these tragedies seek out spritual guidance. While not everyone does, the Greens did and its inclusion in the story is better for it. It portrays the struggle of keeping hope and faith alive in times of strife, which is very relateable.\n\nI'm very happy to have backed this game on KickStarter, and I recommend it to anyone who's looking for an answer to whether or not video games are an art form.","January 19","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I knew I would need to approach slowly and methodically, understanding what this game really was. That Dragon Cancer is a memoir to the passing of a real life child named Joel Green who was afflicted with cancer. He died at 5 years old, too young and too short a life by any imaginable standard. His parents Ryan and Amy Green created this game as a tribute, a diary, and a message of who Joel was and as a reflection of what he had to endure at such a young age. While I knew what to expect from the game from the moment of its inception, I never truly knew how affecting it would be until the credits rolled. I truly have not played or experienced a work of art quite like this because it his almost wholly unique. This game lies on a plane beyond gruff action protagonists, high score chasing and the pursuit of dominance or “bad-assery” that the majority of the game industry covets and chases at all costs. It is personal at the highest level, a bittersweet invitation into the hardship and inevitability of a real life struggle that the Green family and numerous others around the world have and continue to face every single day. It’s an in-depth look at the role of faith and God in the lives of everyday people, and how it brings reflection and comfort in the most difficult of times. And while this remains a review of the game you’ll be receiving, it’s also a hesitant, judgment-free and meticulously gentle word to compliment the immense payoff you’ll receive from playing the game.\n\nPresentation:\nThe game has a simplistic and geometric visual style grounded in abstract expression. Many of the textures and details are purposely omitted in favor of primary colors to express concepts and ideas. The visuals evoke many of the games deeply human concepts effortlessly, whether it be mentally in the minds of Ryan, Amy or Joel, or through the depiction of a story accompanied through dialogue and more. Even the digital forms on screen are simple in design but effective enough to know exactly what you are looking at. The music is non-intrusive, harmonious and decisively melancholic, allowing you to get lost in the flowing of emotion on-screen and within ourselves. Even the dialogue spoken by characters is distinctly soft, but poignant due to the subject matter. It’s clear the aesthetics were designed solely so you could get lost in the spirally roller coaster of Joel’s battle with cancer, from his initial diagnosis and all events proceeding it. The games presentation is so hard hitting and vividly affecting because it is all real. These are digital recreations of real events and the thoughts within the Green family’s minds. This is not a video game with a fictional premise or epic narrative. It’s a family surviving the most difficult moment life can bear: the inevitable and helpless loss of a child. Every narrative moment and dialogue delivery held my attention with utmost respect and complicity because I knew these events actually happened. Every moment felt like I had payed to get a personal glimpse into the most haunting and excruciating moment in the Green family’s life, which gave me pause every time the thought crossed my mind.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay, outside of a few sections, continues the trend of non-intrusive interaction. Relying almost entirely of pointing on objects and directions to proceed for the next piece of narrative. The game will often let you interact with its world and writings, but almost always in limited fashion to advance the story. It is purposely minimal in scope and practice, which suits it because it’s difficult to imagine a single genre that could adequately encapsulate and push forward this tale by mere gameplay alone. The game has some diversity in various sections that work beautifully as game-driven storytelling. It has a driving section in the Green’s home where you briefly take a third person driving view within Joel’s wonderful imagination. There is a simple side-scrolling section with a few enemies and the head of a dragon which match a somber story being told to Joel with cancer as this powerful dragon that many of tried to conquer, to no avail. These are mostly solid, but there are times where it feels like the game was grasping at straws trying to find something interactive to do to fill its gameplay sections, even though I would have been fine simply existing in this space as a bystander and not sticking to normal game conventions in this case. Everything fits well in the context of Joel’s imagination though and these sequences often gave us a breath of air in a deeply reflective and contemplative experience, showing how at the darkest of times humans must sometimes retreat and engage our imaginations to escape a terrifying reality. That Dragon Cancer nails this feeling at almost every turn.\n\nOverall Value:\nOnce again, I’m floored at how I feel I must construct this section of the review differently. Value is a very strange metric to measure, since its objective nature leaves it on a person-by-person basis. The game retails for $15 for about 2 hours of game, which is a price/length ratio that has been criticized heavily in the past. However, I believe the subject matter, personal nature of the family’s struggle and general unique atmosphere and drama of the title lends it weight that few other games have ever matched. The price feels like a mere inconvenience in all honesty, a simple step you engage in to gain access to the work and I paid without a second thought merely due to my desire to view their experience close up. You could easily do research on the Internet to find out Joel’s ultimate fate or watch a Let’s Play and save the money, however there is something about supporting the family and viewing it in my own way that was extremely important to me. Objectively though, the game admittedly offers minimal gameplay and interaction, with only a few sections to speak of on that front, with the rest offering a viewing experience or clicking on papers to read with voiceovers. Gamers who focus heavily on gameplay will likely not be satisfied with what’s on offer, however lovers of narrative driven experiences with gameplay as a simple tool to experience the world will love this title. This title will be poignant in the highest regard to players whose friends or own families have been affected by the wide reaching effects of cancer in real life and to those people, it will likely be a quicker decision.\n\nVerdict:\nThat Dragon Cancer is a very special and personal game. No other video game I’ve ever played has ever given such a blunt and harrowing view into the lives of real people. Often times it feels like the player is opening the diary of the family and peering into the darkest recesses of their hopes and fears, all as they fight and eventually accept the ultimate fate of their child. While terribly sad, it also shows the incredible power of hope and how faith can give us strength in impossible circumstances. Engaging with that sense of inevitability and powerlessness is ultimately this game’s most superb yet surreal achievement. The visuals are simple but effective enough to serve the purpose the game is trying to fulfill. Gameplay purists may leave the title with buyer’s remorse, but that may likely be overridden with the other gifts the game can provide. This game will truly offer very different things to different audiences, something powerful that cannot be fully valued. For me, I also leave the experience with a sense of pride in the game industry I haven’t felt in years, learning the lengths that games continue to strive towards to provide artistic experiences. If art is meant to touch the soul of a person and make them reflect on their life, That Dragon Cancer may be one of the finest examples of art our medium has.","January 25","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has a couple frustrating things mentioned in some other reviews, but overall the story telling is worth the price in my mind. Here are some pros and cons [Spoilers].\n\nPros:\n-The atmoshpere and lighting throughout most of the game really enhances the story telling\n-Most of the voice acting throughout the game is good quality, and holds with the above\n-This game made me actually feel genuine sorrow for Joel and his family, not many games do that anymore\n-The art in many levels is amazing for the polygonal style that was chosen (more in cons)\n-Towards the end when they give the bad news about Joels cancer, it talks about how the doctors and people who helped feel genuine sadness about not being able to help Joel, and gives you insight into what they thought\n-Pancake parties... need I say more?\n\nCons:\n-The art in other sections of the game did feel like there could be more detail, but it did not impede the gameplay\n-The game sometimes made me do an option or two twice and played the same dialog before furthering the story, maybe just a bug, but was slightly imersion breaking\n-Towards the ending it gets REALLY religious on the parents part, which in a smaller dose would have been fine, since many people turn to religion in grief, but by the end I found myself wishing to just get through the references already\n\nHonestly, through out the story, it holds true to what the story is about, a family trying their hardest to help their young son fight his battle with cancer.

The emotion of it didn't even really hit me until the end credits, where players are shown a slide show with photographs of Joel (the child this story is about) and it all became real. These weren't just polygons rendered on a screen, this was a real family, with real suffering.\n\nThe only downside to the experience for me, and this is most certainly a personal thing, was how heavy-handed the religious element was. I certainly have no problem with religion, although I don't practice any myself, but having every other monologue be about God's love, Jesus' strength, or readings from the Bible made this feel like less of a story about the tragedy of childhood cancer, and more like someone encouraging me to go back to church.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the experience. I think it took advantage of the power behind the interactive narrative, allowing players to control the pacing of the experience, and also choosing to let them investigate many small items (like the cards in the hospitol, the one to TotalBiscuit was my favorite) or to let them pass to continue with the story.","February 18","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It disheartens me to see people who didn't like the game claiming it is an attempt to "cash in" on the grief of others due to it being a rather simple, breif venture, because I've seen firsthand just how emotionally engrossed the game's staff was in telling this story. If suffering is art, the very process of developing this game was an artform in and of itself.\n\nWhen it got a release date, I was left unsure how to promote it to others. Saying it was a "game" I was "looking forward" to "playing" felt wrong. Actually, when the game finally released, I purchased it and spent several days staring at it in my Steam library, procrastinating on actually playing it, because I knew I would be doing so much more than just "playing a game." Rather, I would be taking a very personal journey that would both look into the soul of a single human being and encompass the voices of the many, many people - myself included - who have lost a loved one to cancer.\n\nI got exactly what I expected. That Dragon, Cancer pulls no punches and tells the developer's story with no cencorship or remorse. It's an incredibly difficult game to play, as well as a very rewarding one.\n\nIt's hard to say a ton about the gameplay itself, because everything is fairly simple and exists more to help convey the emotion of the story than be "fun" in and of itself. This game pushes the boundaries of the line between cinema and gaming and creates something very unique and very engrossing for its efforts.\n\nIf you're expecting a "fun game" you "look forward" to playing, you won't find it here. If you're expecting to be invited into someone else's soul and watch the sympathy game genre evolve before your eyes through a brilliant mix of sincerity and development skill, you've come to the right place.","February 18","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a "game" about a child having and dying from cancer. But, they kept asking for it, so when it went on sale, I bought it. I decide I would check it out before telling them. Here is what I learned:\n\nI cried through the whole thing. My husband has been battling stage IV lung cancer since 2012. I write about the journey our family has been on. You have to do something to sort out the emotions you are experiencing, and writing is my gift.\n\nGame development is the gift that Eli's dad has. He has used his gift in an amazing way to share his family's experience with the world. This is an immersive experience, more than a game. It is so real and raw.\n\nSo why would someone want to "relive" the cancer experience through a game, or through any other format for that matter? Because in seeing other people's journies, you discover that you are not alone. One of the interesting things in That Dragon, Cancer, was the different ways that each parent coped. The struggles with faith, the reactions to events. It was beautiful to see that other people have the same questions when they face the Dragon. It is also inspiring to see them overcome.\n\nI have been thinking a lot lately about the phrase, "Walk a mile in my shoes."  Until you do that, you really can't impose your value system on others. There has been criticism in some of the reviews about the amount of God and faith in the game. This bothers me because our society has made God and faith taboo. God is how this family overcame the pain of their son's cancer. God is how our family, and many other families, overcome this Dragon.\n\nI would recommend this game highly. Have a box of Kleenex nearby, though. You will need it.","March 26","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The religious part isn't that big as people said. I expected much more god/jesus-staff after some of the critics.\n\nGive this peace of art a chance. Its about 2hours long.

That Dragon is the story of Joel Green, a toddler suffering from brain cancer, and his parents, Amy and Ryan Green. Being made by Amy and Ryan the narrative delivered is personal and can sometimes suffer from that. The game alternates between realistic scenes of Amy and Ryan's time spent with Joel and dreamlike sequences where the emotions of the Greens are explored. This is where I am conflicted. The real-life sequences are masterfully crafted experiences which were emotional, relatable and grounded. These are by far the best parts of the game. The dialogue, setting and sound design all work in perfect harmony and create the most exhaustingly painful experiences I have ever had in a video game. However, the surreal dreamscapes do not convey this emotion and are instead a lot more personal. They convey emotion through dialogue masterfully but the unrealistic environment and thickly layered metaphors give these emotions and the dialogue no grounding in reality and they end up being ineffective and lacking in the ability to evoke the emotion that the real experiences of the Greens do. These are extremely personal sections and as someone who has never had to deal with the knowledge that a loved one will only live for months, maybe only weeks,  these segments dodn't connect as strongly. Another issue that many have is that the Christian themes in the game are "alienating". Honestly, This is ridiculous. The themes of faith and religion penetrate no deeper than their pleas to God for Joel's health and how this affects them. Without the religious themes, this would be a sob story, with them, there is hope. Despite my criticisms, I would absolutely recommend this. That Dragon, Cancer is one of the few games that I sincerely believe everybody should have a chance to experience, even if they decline it.","May 6","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a "game" about a child having and dying from cancer. But, they kept asking for it, so when it went on sale, I bought it. I decide I would check it out before telling them. Here is what I learned:\n\nI cried through the whole thing. My husband has been battling stage IV lung cancer since 2012. I write about the journey our family has been on. You have to do something to sort out the emotions you are experiencing, and writing is my gift.\n\nGame development is the gift that Eli's dad has. He has used his gift in an amazing way to share his family's experience with the world. This is an immersive experience, more than a game. It is so real and raw.\n\nSo why would someone want to "relive" the cancer experience through a game, or through any other format for that matter? Because in seeing other people's journies, you discover that you are not alone. One of the interesting things in That Dragon, Cancer, was the different ways that each parent coped. The struggles with faith, the reactions to events. It was beautiful to see that other people have the same questions when they face the Dragon. It is also inspiring to see them overcome.\n\nI have been thinking a lot lately about the phrase, "Walk a mile in my shoes."  Until you do that, you really can't impose your value system on others. There has been criticism in some of the reviews about the amount of God and faith in the game. This bothers me because our society has made God and faith taboo. God is how this family overcame the pain of their son's cancer. God is how our family, and many other families, overcome this Dragon.\n\nI would recommend this game highly. Have a box of Kleenex nearby, though. You will need it.","March 26","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Beautifully crafted, presented in a slightly abstract world yet rooted firmly in the raw, bleak and sadly too often hopeless reality in which we all exist.\n\nThis interactive narrative holds back no punches as it delves into a topic which we as humans usually shy away from; death, dying and loss. The player follows the final months of Joel as he succumbs to his cancer, looking at it from the perspective of his parents as they struggle to come to terms with this life shattering event. The experience is far from easy, with some scenes that will quite literally have you begging for them to end as you are forced to come face to face with the process of death, and in this case the death of a child.\n\nAn incredible piece of interactive narrative which stands head & shoulders above the sea of adolescent mediocracy which has plagued the video game industry for far too long. Following in the same trend as Gone Home, This War of Mine and Thomas Was Alone, That Dragon Cancer is helping evolve & mature the industry.","April 9","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes. Very much so. That Dragon, Cancer contains a story that can only really have been done as interactive software. Never in my years growing up playing on various systems would have I believed that someone would someday use video games to tell a story like this. Its runtime is no longer than that of your average movie, and in that time it shows the whole spectrum of the Greens' experiences with Joel, from the highest joy to the deepest despair. I can only imagine the pain and bravery from the Greens that was required to recollect these experiences to share with us. I also appreciate the way they portrayed their faith, as it was honest, held nothing back, and wasn't there to preach. Rather, it was there for the player to experience and do with what they will. If what the preceding words describe interest you, please, do not hesitate to give this a run.
