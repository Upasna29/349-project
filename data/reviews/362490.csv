No 2 kills are the same. I'm still finding new ways to ragdoll opponents. This game is extremely hard to learn at first. I spent 10+ hours practicing the combat before I had the basics down well enough to win a few fights.  The flip side is that this game is extremely rewarding and has a lot of replayability. I've owned this game since the fall of last year and Bare Mettle has updated the game with new content 3 times already. Thats an amazing pace.\n\nI've had so much fun crawling through the dungeons. Exanima's main game has a survival horror feel to it. you have to scrounge for clothes, then armor, weapons. (I really like that the clothes and armor can be layered for max effect) It's never easy. The violent collisions in combat are the highlight of Exanima. The control scheme in this game allows for very precise movement and maneuvers. It also allows you to throw all of your bodyweight into an attack.\n\n\n","May 12","true","275.7"," 95 of 103 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","95","103","6","5"

At first I found the controls sluggish and they seemed severely unpolished, but that was only because I wasn't used to the simulated weight of my character. Now, after a couple of hours of practice I'm capable of sweeping my enemies off their feet with a powerful blow of my two-handed mace and bash their skulls against the floor.\n\nProcedural animations and movements bound by the laws of physics makes every battle unique. The combat is not flashy but that makes it so much fun, like a proper brawl. You and your enemies will stumble around and trip over objects lying on the floor while trying to kill each other, and suddenly one of you might strike a blow to the head, which often determines the victor. Fatality...\n\nOne of the funniest moments I had was when I was cornered by two guys. One had a giant axe and the other some whimpy stick. When Mr. Axe swings, I trip over a chair and the axe misses my head by a straw, instead the axe hits Mr. Stick right in the kisser and sends him flying into a wall. Mr. Stick sags down on the floor next to me, and when Mr. Axe tries to hit me a second time he trips over the same chair I did. The three of us flop around on the floor, trying to get up, but the physics of the game won't let us, we're so entangled <3\n\nAh, I will remember Mr. Axe and Mr. Stick with great fondness.\n\nIf you want to try something fresh, this is it. Don't be frightened by the controls when you start out, once you master it, it can be the greatest thing ever.","May 1, 2015","true","98.8"," 108 of 127 people (85%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","85","108","127","52","1"

This combination of genres probably doesn’t make a lot of sense at the first glance, as we usually see physics being one of the main gameplay elements in different puzzle and adventure games alike, but very rarely in something more action-oriented.\n\nThe main feature of the game, which differentiates it from any other top-down RPG, while also defining the gameplay itself, is that almost all the objects in the game world are subjects to physics, including the player character and all the NPCs. Not only does it enable player (or his enemies) to trip over some environmental detail, like a pile of rubble or a carelessly dropped chair, but also completely changes the way fighting works in general.\n\nUsually, in a top-down game, pressing an “attack” button would initiate an animation, at the end of which the target enemy would receive some pre-determined (or calculated via rolling of some invisible dice, DnD-style) amount of damage. In Exanima, it only really does the first of these actions or, to be precise, starts the animation. What happens next is completely dependent on player’s actions: the damage is only dealt if the weapon makes physical contact with the opponent, and its amount is based on three different parameters: type of damage (is determined by the weapon) and the target’s resistance to this particular type, the weapon’s weight, and, most importantly, the momentum that the player has been able to give to it. One single blow can knock your enemy down to the ground or even completely crush him if executed properly, while simply holding the attack button would result in a flurry of weak and easily blockable strikes, which would probably just get you killed.\n\nThe animations, although they are constantly being tweaked and improved, still look kind of sluggish and wonky, leading a lot of people to the conclusion that Exanima is just a “drunken fighter simulator”. When you first start playing, it really does seem that the player has nearly no control over his character’s actions and movement, but after you get accustomed to the controls, the combat system starts working just fine. As the developers say, this game really IS different from the others, so you shouldn’t expect to be able to be good at it from the very start.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, there are currently 3 modes: “Practice” – fighting against some progressively stronger NPCs, “Arena” – practice with global progression (is kind of slow and boring for now) and the main “Story” mode.\nIn the story mode you find yourself alone in a dungeon, crawling with zombie-like creatures, and start trying to find your way out. The dungeon is NOT procedurally generated, and consists of 4 manually created levels, with a save available at the beginning of each one. If you die, you’ll have to start from the checkpoint, leading to a lot of frustration early on. During this noble quest to save… eeh… your life, you will find new weapons and armor pieces (and yes, this game has an incredible equipment system with a few layers of armor), as well of pieces of information about what has actually happened in this dire place. Also, note that most of the damage you take is permanent, and there are only 2 or 3 healing items in the entire game. Regarding the length of the game, I can only say that it took me nearly 13 hours to thoroughly explore the first 2 layers, and only gods know how much I’ve spent on the third.\n\nExanima is currently in Early Access state, and has recently started to develop rapidly; the devs are introducing new mechanics into the game, such as thrusting attacks and skill systems, and it is clear that they are not going to stop the development until it’s finished.\nI would personally recomend this game to anyone who is looking for a new gaming experience and is persistent enough to make it through the early stages.\n\nP.S. As you could have already noticed, English is not my native language, so if you find any mistakes, feel free to point them out.","March 23","true","45.8"," 68 of 72 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","68","72","3","16"

If you antagonize them for whatever reason, however, then they will descend upon you with the wild swinging of an undead barbarian backed with the power of this game's fantastic, all-encompassing physics engine.\n\nEvery single fight in this game could be your last. Against every enemy. This is a game where you are constantly on edge, never able to relax and torn between searching every single room in hope of finding a better piece of gear to protect yourself or avoiding them out of fear of a wild prisoner slamming a lumber axe into your face.\n\nThroughout the environment there are signs of a story. A note here, or a room where a man has attempted to barricade himself in before eventually falling to a horrific onslaught. In another, a man is slumped against a desk, presumably murdered by inmates or servants. The graphics are gloomy and the sound design sinister; it's a dungeon crawler that has  the potential to scare you witless.\n\nAs mentioned before, physics are a huge part of the game. It boasts that it simulates everything and I would be inclined to agree that they're not too wrong. The player is able to drag objects around the world to create obstacles or block doors, even throw wooden planks and crates at enemies to hinder their progress. Combat consists of force, momentum and locational damage. Swing a hammer hard enough and at the correct distance and you can bash your enemy to the ground; but misjudge the distance and your forearm or weapon handle will bounce harmlessly off them. Weapons swung at the same time into each other will collide and blocking is done automatically depending on the availability of your character to adequately protect himself and where you choose to face. You can even swing your character around while holding the attack button to perform larger, more powerful attacks with momentum and force behind them - but the enemy can see these coming and either avoid the attack completely or attack you while you're open.\n\nEnemy AI is fantastic. At first, you may find yourself at every disadvantage. You might find the controls awkward and unfriendly and your character slow or clumsy. But then you realize that your enemy has all those disadvantages too; bound also by the power of the game's physics engine and subject to all the same laws as you. To compensate, each enemy plays almost like you would expect a player too; right down to simulating reaction times and attempting to read your movement to best figure out how to defeat you. It has, by far, the most realistic and engaging melee combat I have ever seen in a video game.\n\nYou need to re-learn how to fight if you plan to play this game - and you should. You need to treat it as though it's as real as any fight you've been in personally. This is not just a game where you have to learn the controls, but a game where you have to truly master your chosen weapon and stay one step ahead of your opponent at all times, because once you die? That's it. You have to start all over again.\n\nIf real men play Dark Souls, then only the baddest of the badasses play Exanima.","May 4, 2015","true","5.8"," 91 of 107 people (85%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","85","91","107","11","0"

In Exanima you explore, fight and survive while grappling with the game's tricky combat system. Exanima is set in a dark 'low-fantasy' underworld and from what I understand from the Store page it's a prelude for a bigger, open world RPG, developed by the same studio.\n\nExanima's main selling point is its unique, physics-based, combat system which tries to be as realistic as possible with a focus on momentum, forces and collisions between characters as well as weapons. In making their combat system so realistic Bare Mettle have inadvertently created one of the most difficult combat systems I've ever come across, even after just over 5 hours of gameplay I'm still really struggling to make heads or tails of it and the explanation of it in the in-game literature isn't helpful either, this is something you have to learn by yourself. However the game's physics doesn't just impact the combat, it also impacts movement and interaction with in-game items so if you run into something on the floor, chances are you're gonna fall over rather than kick it out of the way.\n\nCurrently Exanima is split into two game-modes, Arena and Campaign. Most of the time I've spent with Exanima has been in the Arena trying to grasp the game's combat but I will briefly explain both modes.\n\nIn Arena mode you start out with basic clothes and a basic weapon and you begin in a small room facing off against one enemy who has a one handed weapon and basic clothes. After you kill your first enemy you progress to a new room where you fight a slightly more powerful enemy and that continues until you die. When you do die, which you will, you will have access to any weapons or armour you picked up from your foes during your time in the Arena but these are only saved for your current session, quit the game and you will no longer have access to them.\n\nIn Campaign mode you start with some clothes and a torch and you must make your way through the dungeon which you find yourself in, defending yourself against enemies and then taking what you can from them to make yourself stronger. I've never managed to get very far in Campaign, which is part of the reason why I've stuck to Arena, so I'm not sure if there's any sort of end-game to it or if you just continue exploring forever.\n\n+Very good graphics\n+As mentioned, very realistic physics\n+Hitting/killing enemies is oh so satisfying thanks to the combat system\n+Quite a lot of weapons, items, clothing and armour\n+Excellent character creator which manages to give you a fair amount of power while remaining easy to use\n+Brutally unforgiving\n+Requires some skill to play, it's not just button mashing which is a nice change for isometric RPGs\n+Not all enemies attack on sight which gives you some time to prepare\n+Very unpredictible enemies\n+Good sound effects\n\n+/-Permadeath in Arena and Campaign\n\n-As mentioned the combat is very difficult to wrap your head around and the explanation of how it works in-game isn't very helpful so you need to figure it out for yourself\n-One handed weapons feel underpowered compared to polearms\n-Movement is based entirely on your cursor, for example W makes you walk towards your cursor rather than walk up relative to the camera which I don't really like especially as you have to move the mouse around a lot in combat which leads to a lot of unwanted movement\n-Walking and running animations are a bit odd\n\nHere's a short gameplay video I recorded of the Arena mode:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQmzv7VCbwM\n\nVerdict:\n8\n\nDespite some flaws Exanima presents a unique idea in a good way with very good graphics, interesting combat mechanics and good item variety. Even if you don't want to buy it this is certainly one to watch.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","May 12, 2015","true","5.4"," 110 of 135 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","110","135","4","16"

I won't bother to explain what the description already says, but I will elaborate on how it plays out.\n\nThe games physics engine has a huge amount of effort poured into it, even at this early stage. The strikes you do can land with a crushing thump, or maybe just a light scrape, depending on how you angle your hits and how hard your strike hits. It turns into a very challenging fighting mechanic that rewards careful tactics and good swordsmanship.\n\nHowever, it should be mentioned that at the current time, everyone is drunk. Yes, even the skeletons. Essentially theres two types of stances. Normal movement stance, and fighting stance. Movement stance is fine for the most part. Feels a little funky due to the nature of physics and such, but overall very responsive.\n\nAnd then theres fighting stance. The character readies his weapons, widens his stance, and slowly crab-walks towards his foes with determination. To say the least, it feels a little funny switching between these two modes, and the crabwalk feels a bit unresponsive at times (once again, due to physics. It makes sense when you analyze the movement). However, it does the job well enough.\n\nOnce you get the hang of these, it works. Most of the time, quite well. But even though its mechanically smooth, it feels a bit clunky just due to the very nature of the beast. Expect to die a few times while your getting used to it.\n\nThe combat is very very satisfying. As mentioned before, depending on how you strike a target, or a target strikes you, changes the amount of damage done. Since parrying happens quite often, landing those satisfying blows is just too much fun. Its the delicious crunchy reward after being hammered blow after blow and barely fending them off every time.\n\nThe story at this stage has a little bit of love too poured into it. Its told in dark-souls style, where little fragments of parchment lore are scattered throughout the level, and by reading parchment after parchment you begin to piece together a rough idea of whats happening. So far, it needs quite a bit of work and a little more substance: I've read most of the accessible parchments and I still have no idea whats going on. But, its intriguing, and leaves me searching around for more.\n\nOn whats apparently considered a good run, I completed the current storymode at around 8-10 hours. If you were to speedrun it, I'd probably say it could be completed in less than 2. Exanima has the mindset where levels could be completed very fast if you know where everything is, but most of the fun comes from exploring the various rooms, finding new story fragments, gear, and areas.\n\nWith all that in mind, exanima is a unique experience. Many games say they have physics, but nothing implements the idea so thoroughly as exanima. It permeates its every fiber and decision it makes.\n\nFor that, I'd say its well worth the asking price at the moment for 15 dollars, and its potential is astounding. I'll be watching this game closely as it comes out with updates, and I'd recommend for anyone else who wants to try a truly unique RPG experience.","January 9","true","16.5"," 66 of 73 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","66","73","2","4"

Am I drunk? What is this?\n\nOne hour in: Ok, ok. So moving forward and swinging is pretty good. But what if I use my drunken shove and combo it?\n\nOne hour, thirty minutes in: OH SWEET BABY JESUS THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE ATTACK?! Stab, stab, swing, lounge push, swing... ... ...\n\nThree hours in: Judging by the trajectory of this guy's movements and his previous attempts at coming at me from the side, he's going to move to the left to flank, and that gives me an opportunity to feint after a solid parry to put him on the defensive and back him into a corner. Then... ... ..\n\n\nLook, this game is great.\nIt brings a fresh new formula to combat in top-down action RPGs. At first it feels rather choppy as you flail about to get ahold of the controls, but it turns out to be a system that flows well and keeps you on your toes, regardless of who your enemy is (the AI is very good so far, and beating enemies on equal-footing is always a rewarding feeling).\n\nExanima is very difficult, has a fun learning curve (crazy thought, I know), and overall has pretty great gameplay. The atmosphere is relatively similar to the Dark Souls series in that the dark, gritty setting is coupled with a complete lack of hand-holding and the story is entirely dependant on how much you want to look into it.\n\nThe development of this game appears to be coming along very well, and the devs appear to be quite responsive to their community. I'm quite happy with the progress, which shows no signs of slowing, and I think it's worth every penny of $15- especially if you're already a fan of the genre.","May 19","true","3.1"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","93","54","58","11","4"

I can tell the purpose of each room by the arrangement of objects in it that room. Rooms seem practical. The dungeon really feels like a credible and livable environment.\n2: The fantasy elements are used sparingly, which makes them more important when they appear. This is why I enjoy low fantasy settings. High fantasy has the tendency to overdo the fantastic and throw out logic, which forces the developers to continually ramp up the scale until things get ridiculous and unbelievable. Fantasy based on spectacle is superficial and boring, whereas low fantasy builds and builds in an exciting progression, where all of the times feel important, even the simple ones.\n3: Weapons and armor are clearly created using real world influences, but with a healthy touch of artistic license where it's needed. Never once did I think that something looks too overdesigned to be appealing, or too impractical to ever be used.  Even the expert boss' armor, despite clearly being fantasy, doesn't appear too implausible to break my suspension of disbelief. In Sui Generis, my bet is that it'll take some serious treasure hunting to ever find something like that.\n4: Item randomization is really cool. I love how you can find all sorts of clothes with different colors, fabric, stitching patterns, etc. Even when two objects are of precisely the same kind, they'll still have slight variations to make them appear different. I've always found it bothersome in RPGs where two objects are precisely the same, and this game does away with that. Item randomization also adds another layer of replayability.\n5: Looting is actual looting. I despise when you can find the "+10 polearm of irascibility" somehow inside the entrails of a rabbit, or how stealing someone's clothing creates an exact duplicate on you instead of taking it off them. This game does away with that, by actually taking the clothes off of corpses, and putting important "loot" like weapons and armor in personal chests or in actual armories.\n6: Important objects are reasonably hard to find, but still fair. Seriously, I found the magical helmet in the third level before I found the sword in the bucket in the first level. It's very impressive where some of these items are hidden, yet I never thought anything was too hard to find or placed unfairly. Keys were never placed in the middle of nowhere and were often found in places they'd logically be. The armorer had a key to the armory, the jailer had a key to the jail, etc.\n\nCombat\n1: AI is impressive. I never expected to play a game where the AI would be challenging to a human ever again. This game was a nice refresher. Although the AI do have certain mildly exploitable patterns, they're still challenging and require focus. Even seemingly pathetic zombies can kick your butt if you play your cards wrong or underestimate them.\n2: Physics based combat, using the cursor for turning, a difference between dashes and steps, and character direction based WASD controls made this game have a VERY difficult initial learning curve. Nothing in this game made sense and I thought it was a pile of rubbish. However, I stuck through that learning curve and discovered the true beauty of the physics and movement. At first I felt like a disconnected puppet master jerking about an unresponsive marionette, but now I feel like I know the character I'm playing and can feel them move. It's really something that can't be put into words.\n3: Physiques are extremely interesting and have wildly different impacts on playstyles. Muscular characters have more control over movement, better balance, and can knock other people around better, but are a bit slower and less explosive. Skinnier characters can perform fast and extreme maneuvers, but have slower swings when not aided by movement and can be knocked down more easily. Fat characters can swing faster and be pretty aggressive, but they have poor balance and are easier to hit. This is only for male characters. I haven't even explored female characters in nearly as much depth, but from what I can tell they're generally faster but easier to be thrown around. Effectively, physiques replace the need for "strength, agility, etc" stats in the best way.\n\nPersonally, the only negatives I can think are this game's incredibly difficult initial learning curve and current lack of content. The former is a non-problem for dedicated people who are mature enough to learn a game before calling it crap, and the latter will be solved over time. Exanima feels like a complete game (even though it's still under development!), albeit a short one. If this is a taste of what Sui Generis will be, then I have full confidence in Bare Mettle. It's been so long since I've seen enough good from one developer to trust them.","July 22, 2015","true","313.6"," 63 of 72 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","63","72","3","0"

You'll be here for a while.\n\nSTORY\n\nYou start out as a character who, I assume, has either fallen into a dungeon and been rendered unconscious, or chosen to do so willing. Let's assume the first option is correct. Regaining consciousness, you wake up, grab your torch, and set off deeper into the dungeon, as returning to the surface doesn't look possible.\n\nYou can piece the story together slowly, collecting scrolls here and there, but not many. This game is somewhat like Dark Souls, where the story isn't fed to you. You have to discover it on your own, though I'm not sure enough information is given to even do so. However, I haven't gotten far in the game, as I have a kill-on-sight mentality, which is not helpful in a game like Exanima. Therefore, I cannot give an accurate review of the story.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nRegarding the main game, from the start, you are given a torch. There are other items to find if you are clever enough to find them. The game is based on a system where you slowly improve your weapons and armor over time by killing those around you and taking their loot or raiding chests and rooms. That being said, the game is  very  hard. Don't expect to begin playing and immediately start dominating your enemies. In the beginning, you  will be killed, again and again and again. This should be expected, as combat and movement takes some getting used to. This will be covered in a later section.\n\nThe enemies you encounter are smart, and will not go down without a fight. They must be handled carefully, as damage in this game is something you do  not  want to take. Regarding damage, there are two types: lethal, and non-lethal. Lethal damage is represented by the color red, while non-lethal is represented by a darker yellow than the rest of your health bar. Lethal damage does not regenerate, though some of it can be regained through healing items, which are  very rare. Non-lethal damage does regenerate, however, but slowly.\n\nThe game features a mostly realistic physics system, where being careless can cause you to trip or be knocked down, sometimes dealing damage upon hitting the ground (theoretically). This also allows your enemy to get multiple hits on you, which can get you killed quickly. You can manipulate many objects in the game; though it is typically not necessary, you may need to do so to reach an item or a door.\n\nThe game is level-based, though your character is not saved between levels unless you enable early checkpoints in the options menu. This is recommended if you are looking for a more rewarding system of gameplay, as nothing you do will matter if you die without reaching a checkpoint (the next level).\n\nArmor and weapons go up significately in tear as you progress. Eventually your armor, with its unique layering system, will negate all non-lethal damage, and your weapons will do much more damage. Weapons will do more damage based on how much armor the other person is wearing. Damage is dealt based on what part of the body the weapon strikes, and with what part of the weapon the body is struck.\n\nThere is an arena mode with two difficulties to go alongside with the main game, where you simply engage in one-on-one combat against many stages of enemies, each one pitting you against an increasingly more difficult and well-armored enemy. There are two arena types: novice and expert. I recommend you complete both to get a feel for the combat before entering the main game.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThis game does look quite nice, and does not require a very good computer to run. The lighting is realistic, adding to the overall sense of immersion. There isn't much else to say about this category, really.\n\nCONTROLS\n\nThe controls for this game will definitely take some getting used to. The game features a unique muscle-system, where turning with your swing will do much more damage than a normal swing. Movement can be controlled with WASD, or with the mouse.\n\nIn combat mode, you always face the direction of your pointer, and movement is relative to it as well. This will take some getting used to for a new player, but eventually it will seem natural. Ducking allows for you to dodge the enemy's attack (most of the time). You can parry the weapon by moving the pointer in the direction the attack is coming from.\n\nPOLISHING\n\nThis game feels very polished, and was programmed very well. Good job, developers!\n\nRATING AND FINAL REVIEW\n\nI would like to give this game a rating of 9/10. It is an amazing experience, though I would like to express my thoughts on the need of a better saving-system. I feel as if the current one is too challenging, but very rewarding.

Truly, introducing sledgehammer to your opponent's head has never been this satisfying, as some other reviewer put it. The graphics are bleak and sharp and I enjoyed the aesthetics very much indeed.\n\nThe game crashes seldomly, however, you can always return to the exact point of the crash, so nothing is lost in the process.

Ever since I played the original Mount and Blade I'd been craving a skill based, brutal, single player (or coop) experience and Exanima delivers in spades. But it doesn't stop with just that either. Exanima doesn't hold your hand, but it also doesn't leave you wondering what to do. This is  a game that forces you to pay attention, that makes you slow down and really take in the world around you. One time I couldn't find a key to open a door, it turned out that the key was on the floor under a table, where it landed when the zombie I'd just smashed with my axe slammed into said table and knocked the key down. I walked right past that key probably 10 times because I was still in Skyrim mode, waiting for my quest marker to show me where to go and what to do.\n\nEverything in this game is controlled by physics, They can be picked up, rotated, placed with precision even to the point of building things like bridges over chasms and other physics based puzzles... or just throwing a chair in the way of your enemies to make them trip before clubbing them from on high like baby seals.\n\nThe combat is unique and amazing and hillarious and brutal. It may be the first game I've ever played where people watching me play, grunt and "OOOoohhhh" when I wrap my long sword around the back of someone's head with a sickening smack and watch them fold under the weight of the blade. It's probably the only time I've paid full price for a game on steam. And it's definitely the only time I've wanted to pay more JUST to support the development.\n\nIf you have the stones to step up and learn a new way to play games and the hard headedness to keep at it through more than a few painful losses early on then you're going to love Exanima and you'll never be able to go back.","February 13","true","137.9"," 42 of 46 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","42","46","4","1"

Feel the burn of new neural pathways being paved in your brainosphere.\nIn its unfinished state, Exanima is highly playable for its sords and a challenges alone.

It is NOT at all your average or typical dungeon crawler.\n\nYou don't play Exanima running through mashing buttons to do different wild attacks and mad collecting every piece of loot.  You just don't.  This is a game made where you wake up in an unknown dungeon location (although it's the same map and dungeon every game right now, no procedural generation).  You quickly discover that the controls are vastly different from every other dungeon crawling game you have ever played.\n\nTo move the easiest way is to stop trying to use WASD period.  Instead put your cursor on the screen the direction you want to move (regardless of which way you currently face) and then hold down the right mouse button.  To walk, put the cursor a little distance from your character.  To move faster, simply move the cursor further away from your character.  It takes a little getting used to and feels quite satisfying once you familiarize yourself with it.  You can use the WASD keys to move but they work differently depending on if you are in combat or just exploring.  In combat they move closer to what we are used to springing your character in the direction forward, left, backwards, or right for W, A, S, and D respectively.  (This is according to the direction you face)  In exploration mode, the A and D key rotate your character around 360 degrees in a circle, W moves you a step forward, and D takes a step back.\n\nAny item that is light enough in weight to be moved by your character realistically can be dragged or moved.  For example if you find a board lying on the ground, pick it up by first moving your character close to it then putting your cursor on it and holding down the left mouse button.  Now you'll see the board picked up from the ground in the air.  You can now use WASD to rotate the board along different axis's.  Drop it in the position you have it rotated in by letting go of the left mouse button.  If the item is an item that can be used a weapon or armor, then you can equip it or put it in your inventory by pressing the I key for "inventory" on your keyboard.  This opens a window that shows your character and a space for your inventory.  To equip it, drag it to your avatars picture in the window, and to place it in your inventory, drag it to the area below your character.\n\nCombat is this games bright spot.  It looks VERY real.  The movements and lunges your character makes are very, very believable and doesn't look anything like any of these dungeon crawlers I've ever played.  So if you are expecting Diablo or God of War combat here, this may not be the game for you.  That ain't happening here no matter how skilled you become.  Timing and movement are key in combat as well as your positioning.  Simply hit the TAB key to alternate between combat and normal modes.  Now in combat mode, your cursor will change to a red icon and you drag the cursor  the direction you want to swing any equipped weapon by holding down the left mouse button and dragging.  But this isn't a game where you want to spam attacks as quickly as you can.  This is more timing and accurate paths made by you to attack when your enemy is 'open' to an attack.  If you swing at the wrong time, you'll leave your character open to an attack that could get you killed.  If you have a shield, simply do nothing but make sure you face your enemy and your character will do the best he/she can to block any attacks with their shield.\n\nI have not even come close to mastering the combat enough to feel confident in starting the exploration of the games dungeon yet.  Thankfully, there is an "Arena" mode where you can hone your skills before actually playing the main game.\n\nOnce I get more familiar with this game and can actually play the game.. I will make more videos on my YouTube channel and I will update this review as well.  For now, all I can say is that I highly recommend this game on it's design brilliance and it's unique realistic approach as well.  I think that is simply awesome and gives this game such a different feel and immersion of more fantastical games of this sort.\n\nEnjoy!","April 30, 2015","true","1.9"," 69 of 95 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","69","95","3","0"

I then proceed to juke and jive, float like a butter fly and knock their block off. It is diablo mixed with mount and blade.\n\nThe learning curve is tough at first because its such a different take on an isometric action RPG. There is blood and gore.

Nothing is more satisfying that dropping a hammer on an opponents face and watching them crumble into a broken pile.

Perhaps even revolutionary.\n\nWhile I rejoice in this game's creation, I despair that the control scheme will be too intimidating for some, and that they will not be able to appreciate the depth of the mechanics therein.  If you enjoy Skyrim, but find the combat sorely lacking and unbalanced... if you think Dark Souls is great because of the relatively challenging combat... I strongly recommend Exanima.  Not only for the experience itself but for the support you'll be giving the dev team as they work on Sui Generis, for which Exanima is a prelude.\n\nI can't remember looking forward to a game as much as I am Sui Generis.\n\nI can't muster enough praise for what Madoc and the Bare Mettle team have done here.\n\nWhile additions and enhancements are still being made, the Exanima campaign in and of itself is nothing to write home about.  I personally found a lot of the exploration to be tedious.  Some will disagree with me but the game desperately needs some automapping.  There's a bunch of crap lying around, and if you don't use a guide you'll wonder how much of it you have to sort and sift through to find everything.\n\nHowever, all of these complaints pale when viewed in light of what should be the focus here... the great combat mechanics and dynamic environment in general.  I really hope this game succeeds and other developers use the game engine to make their own games, because there are so many possibilities.\n\nThe arena mode in this game is worth the price alone.  You'll struggle with the novice arena first, gradually getting a hang of the controls and gradually progressing through the ranks.  You'll come to the first shield bearer and get frustrated with how hard he is to hit.  By then you'll be hooked, and your skills will only increase and finally you will beat the arena and move on to the expert one.  And if you're like me, you'll do it all over again and again because it's so cool and fun to try with different weapons and playstyles.\n\nTLDR - The coordination required for the controls might deter some, but if you can handle that and are looking for fresh physics-based combat mechanics, pick up this game and keep an eye out for Sui Generis.","October 14, 2015","true","156.8"," 43 of 54 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","43","54","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrMongy/recommended/362490/","MrMongy","Mongy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrMongy/","294 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nExanima is an extremely underrated RPG-esque dungeon crawler with less on the idea of acquiring loot and more on the idea of progressing and trying to stay alive.\n\nPHYSICS Let me just start off by saying that the physics in this game are absolutely jaw-dropping, and easily (in my opinion) puts Grand Theft Auto V's physics to shame. Don't be fooled, the physics are no gimmick! The game heavily revolves around the realisticness of you, the other NPC's movement and the environment around you. If you were to run into a piece of rock on the ground then you are very likely to trip up and smash your face in.\n\nCOMBAT The combat, again, relies heavily on the physics. It will require your complete attention, a good deal of practise, and a tiny bit of patience. It is not easy, but it is not badly made. How you perform in combat depends on the individual that is playing. Great fun.\n\nGRAPHICS The game is incredibly good looking, and can be run on its highest settings on most machines. The environment and its inhabitants are extremely detailed for a game of its size.  Also, the lighting is perfect, this game can be very dark, and with a nice warm flickering torch in your hand you can truly appreciate the shadows that this game offers.\n\nSOUND One of my favourite features of this game would probably be the sound, if you were to hit a certain material (primarily metal and wood) against another object it will create its appropriate noise. If your sword accidentally gets dragged against a wall as you're walking by then it will create a fantastic scraping sound to accompany it. If you bang a bit of wood against somebodies helmet then you'll get a nice thud to go along with it. The music is haunting and can set a sense of isolation, though you will probably hear that same music during your whole playthrough.\n\nINTERACTION So we know that the physics affect your movement and combat, but it also affects your interaction with the environment. You will need to use your cursor to open doors, lift items such as crates to look underneath them for anything of use and physically pick up and drop things into your inventory, straight off of the floor. It is very identical to the Amnesia series in this sense, and it works very well. But you are not limited to just opening doors and searching for items, eventually you will be given a series of puzzles which will require you to use whatever objects around you to advance to the next room, objects including chairs, planks and small rocks.\n\nNow that we have all of the technical stuff out of the way, what is the game itself actually like? What is it about?\n\nImagine this, you awake in a large room lying on your face, you get up to find a flaming torch in the centre, equip it and venture off into the pitch black corridors, probably unarmed. In this dungeon-like setting you will encounter other neutral but wary humanoids like yourself. "Are they hostile?" You'll be thinking to yourself, get too close and they will be, give them some room, maneuver around them and you should both get away unscathed.\n\nYou are given one life in this game. Yes, you read that correctly. You get one life. If you so happen to die (which you most likely will) then your character will be gone, erased, bye bye. Go and make another one and start from the beginning. Think Project Zomboid.\n\nAnd now I'm going to explain how your health works, You will begin with a full bar of health displayed in a nice bright yellow colour, this is good. If you get hit then your yellow bar will deplete a little and will be replaced by either an orange or a red colour, this is bad. Orange is a non-critical injury and will eventually fill all the way back up to the nice yellow colour we were talking about. If it's red then you have taken a nasty hit and this is considered a critical, this will not fill back up to yellow and you are stuck with this injury for life, critical hits are usually caused by sharp objects and you will notice a nice blood squirt to signify this. If you are in need of refilling your health then you will have to progress through the game to find one of the very scarce health drinks available.\n\nAnd just so that I don't forget, yes, you can create your own character in this game, sex, skin colour, body mass, voice, hair, whatever. You can create your own character.\n\nAnd along with creating a character you can personalise your individual by choosing what weapons/clothes/armour you're going to equip. And there are PLENTY of items to equip (if you ever get to find them that is, keep your eyes open).\n\nThis game is fantastic, it is fairly new at the time of writing and very much unique. It is packed with content already and is apparently quite close to becoming a fully released title (we're talking months!).\n\nFor its price you are practically stealing this game.\n\nAnd if you do buy this game, then you are signing a virtual contract to say that you're ready to try something new, something unforgiving, and something unnerving and fun.\n\nEnjoy.","August 14, 2015","true","12.9"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","31","36","4","3"

I have played many earlier versions, and have many more hours of game time than what my steam time implies.\n\nA prelude to a game called Sui Generis (yet to be released), Exanima is an excellent dungeon crawler with a stellar combat system.\n\nUsing real physics as the basis, the combat in the game is hugely dynamic and skill reliant. Though the mechanics are simple to understand, there is a deep level of complexity involved in it. You have to aim each swing and each parry, you have to provide power and speed by rotating your character, and gracefully dodge your enemies strikes. It is a difficult system to master, one which requires some patience, but is infinitely rewarding once you get it right. It's unlike anything I have previously played, and a breath of fresh air in the RPG genre. The combat (at the point of writing this review) is still not feature complete, with additional combat manouvers, ranged combat and level system on its way. Despite this, it feels very much complete.\n\nThe underworld in Exanima provides a tense and mysterious atmosphere, one which drives you to explore and wonder what awaits around each corner. It is a grim and dark place, set in a low fantasy setting. The game tells its story through the environment, books, parchments. Your character seemingly having lost his memory, it's up to you to piece everything together. It is much like what is seen in the Souls series in this regard, at least thus far.\n\nIt is a difficult game. Wether you test your might in the progressive arena mode or venture through the dungeon, the game will surely pose a challenge. And like any difficult game, it features serrious consequences for mistakes. Taking hard blows, or being cut by slashing weapons may leave you with permanent damage. The only way to heal this back up is by using a very rare potion that there only exist a few of in the dungeon, assuming you have the wit to search and find them in the first place. And if you die in the dungeon, thats it. You'll have to start over. Though it can be frutrating at times, it is this fact that makes the experience of progressing so rewarding.\n\nThe game treats you as a person with intelligence and willingness to learn, each victory and discovery is earned by you and not given to you. This is a refreshing feeling, since nowadays games mostly treat you as a fragile kid that needs everything fed to him with a spoon. Exanima aims to against this trend, which it very much succeeds in doing.","April 29, 2015","true","30.3"," 45 of 60 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","45","60","0","0"

The physics and object interaction is great; whether it's tripping someone up by slinging rogue furniture in their path, or just taking a moment to appreciate the defensive boon one gains by wearing a wooden bucket on their head. The combat is intuitive(although the learning curve is steep) and it feels really satisfying to land a good blow. The maps are sprawling and winding, and navigation falls to strict use of the compass and a journal to make notes- an appreciation for the old school. The gear...I love the gear. From armor to weapons, there are a lot of different things(and variants of those things) for you to sort through to find what caters to your style. The armor all feels very appropriate, too. It's not flashy, over the top 'let your buttcheeks breathe' armor- It's dungeon armor. It is also worth noting that your character tumbling about and falling over when you intentionally run them into clutter is just about the funniest damn thing on the planet.\n\nSo throw on your several layers of jerkin, decide whether you want a morning star or a battle axe, and get ready to get your ♥♥♥ kicked all the way to the top.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/362490/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNote: This is an Alpha 0,5,3 Review, and the key was provided to me for review purposes.\nOverviewExanima is a dungeon crawler exploration game with a very unique approach to combat and gameplay, which is both good and bad, depending on your preferences. The world is NOT procedurally generated, and structured on levels. It features perma-death, and this unforgiving nature of the game forces the player to exercise extreme caution, as every wrong decision could have devastating results.\n\nBefore we begin:Note that this game is still in Alpha, and there is no way of knowing how the game will change over time. If I notice anything that might alter the review, I will try my best to edit it accordingly. These points are what I think of the current state of the game, and you will see shortly that a pro/cons list is very hard to put together because of the controversy. Some might like an aspect, some would say it's a deal breaker. As such, I have written these from my perspective. Feel free to move them around the list as you please.\n\nThe Pros:Beautiful Graphics - It's clear that the developers put together the graphical system first, and worry about the gameplay aspects after. The game looks beautiful, the atmosphere is tense, the lighting system accurate and realistic, the objects are detailed and physics-enabled. Engine wise, this game is pretty well polished.\n\nSuspenseful Environment - Due to the fact that this game is permanent death, and most of the dungeon is shrouded in darkness, exploring the labyrinth is really exciting. My eyes are constantly jumping across the screen, trying to observe if it is safe or not. The sound of footsteps, squeaking doors and the flickering light of your torch create a creepy vibe that resembles that of a horror game.\n\nPhysics Based Combat - One of the main features of this game is the combat system. All weapons and armor have realistic stats that reflect how useful they are to you. Things such as body coverage, resistance to different types of attacks, and how good a weapon is at conveying a certain type of swing, such as slashing, crushing and so on put you make you really consider what you are wielding. Also, everything has mass. You are inflicting damage based on how, where and when you hit the enemy, and the animations are realistic and unique because they are not predetermined motions hard-coded by the developer, they are actual physics simulations.\n\nHand Crafted World - Something that really bothered me on other games, like Torchlight or Diablo, was that the dungeons were so architecturally unrealistic. Not here. Here, everything has a purpose. It is clear what rooms serve what function, everything is beautifully furnished and equipped, and you can discern sleeping quarters, kitchens, forges, lumber stations, interior gardens, studies, storage rooms and the such. You feel like you are actually exploring a working, used to be living-in and used castle.\nThe Cons:Unintuitive and hard to master Combat - Moving is relative to the character instead of the camera, and the physics based combat is really hard to master. Prepare to die often. I would suggest entering the Arena mode before attempting to play the main game. You will see what I mean. It's hard to put into words, but the combat is unnecessarily difficult, even if you get the realistic physics, the way you move and the inputs required are unintuitive and a bit too much.\n\nForced Permanent Death - Many hard-core gamers would see this as a challenge and enjoy it, though combined with the horribly hard to master combat system and movement scheme make it too hard. I've often times found myself not exploring parts of the map because I was afraid of well equipped enemies. It's true, this makes the player think before acting, and encourages a stealthy approach, and I appreciate that, however an option to disable it and use some kind of sensible save system would be greatly needed.\n\nArena Mode Levels - In arena mode, you can test your mettle and practice combat, but it is structured on levels, and is permanent death as well. So, for instance, say I beat the first three levels, but the fourth enemy is hard to beat. If I die, I have to redo the first three levels again! And lost health is not restored after winning a battle (only the temporary damage is restored). So it's very hard to get to a higher level and practice tougher enemies, which is exactly what you want to do in the first place.\n\nNo Random Map Mode - Not really as bothered by this one, as I've listed the detail put into the map in the pros, but if you take into account the fact you'll most probably die many times, you will be forced to replay the same map over and over again, where every item's location is known (except containers, which are randomised), and the path you need to take is also known. I would like to see a random map mode where you can face a new challenge each time.\nConclusionIf you're wondering whether or not you want to purchase this game, here is my advice. Buy only if you want to support development. While I must admit I see great potential in this game and the developers have made a great job thus far, I am generally against Early Access Titles. It is a great game and a greater challenge to face, and you WILL get frustrated by its difficulty at least a few times, but bear in mind - it's still Alpha.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more of my recommended games, you can view my reviews here, and be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 13, 2015","true","8.7"," 43 of 58 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","43","58","3","0"

The game where everything I've ever wanted from a game came true.\nWhat's Exanima? It's a masterpiece put together with great attention to detail.\n\nBeware: this is not your ordinary isometric dungeon crawler, it's much more. For starters: everything is physics based. Attacks, momentum, part of your weapon that hits the enemy and part of the enemy you hit matters.\n\nThe game doesn't feel Early Acess except for the fact that is really short. The variety of items and weapons makes it really suitable for almost every playstyle. The equip regions make sense and are solid. The looting feels great and organic.

In this game the combat feels like there is actually depth to it, like you are actually hitting something, which is a cause of great sound effects and responsive movement to hits and the environment. You can suffer fatal wounds (red bar) or stamina damage (dark yellow bar) fatal wounds can't be regenerated unless you find a rare blue potion (salve) which regenerates your wounds.\nYou wear armor in layers which is heavily inspired from the late middle ages, for example:\n(Gabeson < Leather Tunic < Breast Plate). Each armor has protective abilities against all sorts of damage values: slash, crash, pierce, impact (which is the weight of the weapon and it's momentum capabilities), weight and also encumbrance (how uncomfortable your armor is to wear).\n\nThe game currently has 3 distinct modes, practice, arena and story.\nPRACTICE - In practice you choose gear from the startup menu and practice your abilities of combat, this is the first mode you are ought to play, because this game is very hard at first. The practice is made out of novice arena and expert arena, after you beat both you can either advance to story mode or advance to Arena.\n\nARENA - In this mode you find your self in a room with 2 boards, (Character Management and the Matches Menu)\nIn character managment you can customize your character with feats which you acquire with exp and gear which you buy from the store (I will get to that later), in addition you can also recruit additional player characters and npc hirelings who can fight either alone or with you in various matches.\nThe other board is your matches menu, in which you fight your way through random opponents who are divided to ranks  in which you progress as you level up, the higher the rank the better the gear. The opponents are also divided to tiers, the higher the tier the better he fights.\nTiers and Ranks are divided to: inept, aspirant, novice, adept, expert and master. What you can wear as aspirant you can't wear as inept, but what you can wear as inept you can wear as aspirant. To enter matches you are required to put a fee first, if you win you will get the winning reward which is way higher than the fee you put in first but you also have to be risky, if you lose, not only you are risking to lose your character completely, but also to lose valuable money.\n\nStore - In the store you buy your gear with the money you earned from the matches. Currently at the time of this review the high rank gear is somewhat expensive and requires a big amount of grinding.\n\nSTORY - Now, also one of the strong points of this game is the story mode, in which you are dumped into a dungeon with only a torch and basic clothes. In the dungeon you will find parchments and books which which give you information about the lore, the dungeon and the story behind it. You will learn from this game to piece things together, and not only getting your information from readable sources, but also from looking at the architecture, the state of the undead which are at the dungeon, their clothing and etc. Think of the story like a piece of art you need to decypher. Also some of the undead at the dungeon are friendly and are not going to fight you on sight, but if you make a suspicious movement, (running, combat mode, or getting too near them) they will attack you.\n\nTLDR - This is an amazing piece of a game, I highy recommend it to everyone who likes\nrogue-like games and medieval combat. The learning curve is steep and you are going to spend a lot of time learning the game, but when you do learn the combat mechanics you are going to have a blast.\nI wrote my review like a guide so you are free to read it when you feel lost. If you have further questions you can ask me, I've finished all what this game has to offer untill now so I think I can answer most questions.","March 24","true","85.5"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","27","31","0","0"

It's sort-of Roguelike, very tricky, but pretty fun.\n\nYou make a weak peon and subject them to the horrific trials of you trying to figure out how to play, getting beaten up by goons and tripping over beds and boxes, occasionally getting a meager kit together and then dying shortly after.\n\nExanima sort of plays like Baldur's Gate or something, but the game is a bit more bleak. A little like Dark Souls in tone. The combat is really the highlight of the game, because it's one of the most unique features. It's strongly physics-based and each character has a system of balance and musculature.\n\nYou have a couple of basic attacks, which doesn't sound like a lot, but there is a lot of skill in just how well you execute them. The weapons have very precise damage zones, and won't work well if you get the attack wrong. For example, a polearm with a hook on the end has to hit with the hook. Otherwise you will hit the enemy with the handle and it won't do anything. The fights are often different and unique, and occasionally you can stumble on something and fall over in a fight, letting your enemy clobber you easily. Despite having only some basic swings, fights feel very free-form, and often extremely chaotic. Sometimes things go wrong and you get punished.\n\nThe levels are big, and fairly difficult. I had to watch some youtube videos to figure out what I was supposed to do. The game basically doesn't hold your hand at all. It offers a one-time warning of its difficulty.\n\nSo I guess it won't be for everyone, but it's a pretty original game in my opinion, definitely worth playing for fans of the dungeon-crawl genre.","January 28","true","19.2"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","29","35","2","0"

Lord knows there are a ton of other interface issues, but those are easy fixes.\n\nBasically the question is "what does this combat system bring to the table?"   In other words, what do I gain for having to get accustomed to such an unwieldy system?  My hope would be that I would gain a finer control and a higher level of interactivity than is present with other melee combat systems.\n\nAt the moment, I feel like this isn't the case.  When I want to stike a blow at someone's head, half the time it ends up hitting his arm, and there's nothing I can do about it.  When I want to do a quick jab, I can't (not implemented).  When I want to do a wider, heavier swing, I can't because attempting to do so makes moving my character almost impossible do to the way the movement controls work.\n\nAnd that's the game's biggest issue right now.  While in combat, WASD moves your character in relation  to the way he's facing, and he always faces the cursor.  If I kept my cursor on my target the whole time (like how you attack in Diablo), this type of movement is something I could maybe get used to.  Unfortunately, to do a heavy swing you're REQUIRED to swing your cursor in a 180 arc around your character, while in the heat of combat.  This means that your character is constantly facing a different direction, which means the forward key will constantly move you in a different direction.\n\nSo in the heat of battle, I'm left with nothing but my standard attack and my overhead swing.\n\nI think the game would be GREATLY improved if, while in combat, the character moved in relation to the camera, and the camera was locked behind the player's back.  Basically, it would be like Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight system, except with a more overhead angle.  This would reduce the learning curve substantially and make the game a lot more fun, without losing any of the cool physics ideas this game brings to the table.\n\nI think this game has a lot of potential, but I worry about critical reception until the combat system is fixed.","April 29, 2015","true","8.5"," 54 of 79 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","54","79","2","9"

Sadly only one save per game, though.) I set out a little more carefully this time. (still torch and shield, because what better way to go? Protect yourself, AND see the danger!)\n\nUnbeknownst to me, this game would actually give me "NOPE.jpg" moments which I actually love! One example was when I was walking down a dark corridor, I opened a door on the side into a dark room just to see my torch shine onto one of the Hollows standing there in the dark, no shirt on, holding an axe. I closed that door and continued on my way, not to look back.\n\nSo yeah, it's funny, sometimes spooky, all around a good experience buuuut...\n\n(Note: This game is still only early access, so no throwing blame around for what follows!)\n\nIt's controls are frustrating sometimes. Due to the physics engine, I find myself getting caught on invisible objects, or objects with hitboxes that don't seem to fit what it looks like sometimes. A great example that I couldn't stop laughing at is, Patty got her hand stuck in a closed door at one point, resulting in some funny moments that reminded me of stretching bubblegum.\n\nThe combat is a little hard to get a grasp on when you're just starting, but after playing for a couple hours, and getting a hold of it altogether, it's not as bad as initially thought!\n\nAt some points, mainly the earlier areas, the FPS dropped really low, and when they raised back up? It acted in a slingshot manner almost like the game was trying to catch up.

I think it'd be easy to write this off as an interesting tech-demo, something cool, but ultimately too flakey and hilarious to be taken seriously.\n- Think again - you'll start out looking like a drunken fool stumbling around, but put in a day or two learning and practicing, and it starts to click.  What you'll find is a game that is mechanically incredibly deep, where you can and will learn to shift your weight, anticipate and avoid attacks, follow through on a swing to clip someone in the back of the leg, lunge into someone to push them over a chair before smashing them with an overhead blow.  It quickly starts to feel very natural, and incredibly well balanced.\nI know a little of dynamics simulation, and I'm truly astounded by what Bare Mettle have achieved here.  To make it functional would be impressive, to have made it feel natural is beyond my comprehension!\n\nMy only wish would be to have it a little more traditional RPG - with dialogue and varied locations, rather than what it appears to be at the moment - a pure labyrinth dungeon-crawl.  A stunningly beautiful one - the lighting and attention to detail is sublime, but exploring does start to get a touch repetitive.\n(Edit: I just realised that Exanima is a "prelude" to Sui Generis, and that it looks like pretty outdoors locations shall be arriving eventually - whoop whoop!)\nI'm not sure the combat could ever get repetitive though - so far I've battled nothing more than countless generic zombies, and yet each and every fight feels intense, unique, and absorbing.\n\nEven at this stage, where there's very clearly only half a game here, I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone willing to put the time in to learn it.  Once it clicks, you won't be disappointed!\n\nI very much look forward to seeing how the completed game ends up.","November 11, 2015","true","21.3"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","28","36","0","0"

The story mode/dungeon is still abysmal, and many of the below complaints become magnfied by the narrow confines and questionable design choices of that mode.  However, the arena.... this is where this game shows  promise.  The mechanics of the game are far better suited for this type of game mode, however since most are buying for Story Mode, it's hard to recommend.\n\nThe new arena mode (in beta right now) is much better than the previous iterations.  Persistent character combined with progression (that needs tweaking) as well as a in-game shop, new arena matches (including a 6 man FFA), NPCs that you can recruit...all of this adds much needed depth and content to the most enjoyable part of the game.\n\nBe warned : this game is difficult to learn.  The control/camera system is unlike anything you've played, some say unique, some say downright clunky/broken.  Death is permanent, a lot of progress can be lost.  There is NO mapping feature.  You will get lost.  You will get frustrated.  There are no saves, only checkpoints that are few and far between.  If you want very different combat system and an arena combat type game - I recommend this.   If you want an enjoyable dungeon crawl RPG ...I would do some more research.  You might be disappointed.  Also, the community is filled with hardcore cheerleaders/fanboys/kickstarter backers who will defend EVERY mechanic with religious fervor.  The Devs make no bones about it, your opinion, if its not in line with their 'creative vision', is not wanted, and is in fact, meaningless.\n\nSummary of negatives\n\n-You will die many, many times adjusting the camera during a fight because of the wonky system they have in place where your mouse cursor's location is what you use to turn and face your character.\n\n-If you get too close to a wall, camera will go to a top-down view, rather than turn the wall transparent like other isometric games, which can really screw up your ability to attack/parry/dodge\n\n-Swinging weapons feels wrong. You don't need to throw your entire body into swinging a sword. It's not realistic, I could handle a sword better IRL. Even after 10 beers. Your character displays no finesse or dexterity whatsoever, he swings all his weapons as if they're a 30 pound baseball bat, many times spinning around or ending up wildly out of position because the game engine requires you to use movement/footwork in order to enhance the strength of your blows.\n\n-movement in combat (dash / walk) is sluggish and unresponsive. Your character behaves as if he is fighting in a swamp wearing 200 lbs of armour (regardless of whether you're actually wearing armour)\n\n-Blocking is done automatically and really feels broken. Many times the AI will swing right over/under your parry, some times right through it.\n\n-Overhand strikes are incredibly slow. These are also the only decent way to hit an opponent who has been knocked to the ground, but you will miss more often than not due to abysmal aiming system and terrible control of your character. Inputs are just so exaggerated and lagged to give any real feeling of precision in combat\n\n-Dungeon mode is boring and dreary. Same map every time. Mobs roam, sure, but many spawn in the same spots and don't move until you open the door they're standing behind.\n\n-Loot is limited to armour, weapons, clothing.  The game tries to follow a realistic medieval gear system.  Keep that in mind, this is not Diablo by any stretch of the imagination.  Armour is incredibly valuable for your survivability, and it is not easy to come by at first.\n\n-no map, terrain all looks the same, so unless you are blessed with an incredible direction sense/memory, be prepared to continually retrace your steps until you cave and google the homemade maps people uploaded (yes, they had to make their own maps using graph paper)...or you straight up memorize the lay out of the 3 current levels. You are provided with a compass, and nothing else currently.  This is a major issue for me, I absolutely hate wandering aimlessly through the same areas over and over because I just can't tell where I've been and where I haven't.\n\n-no voice acting, no cinematics. It consists of finding scrolls, books, letters. Story is told in bits and pieces as you explore.\n\n-very little in the way of options and customization\n\n-can't save your game, though every level does have a check point system now, which only came after a large vocal outcry when the game first released. Ironically, requests for a system for saves were met with derision and condescension ("Maybe this game isn't for you." / "Go play another game.") by the Insider Kickstarter Elitists.\n\n-devs and staunch defenders of this game will constantly defend game flaws as "realism", "immesion", "physics", "hardcore", "challenging" when in reality they're just defending bad design choices and wonky mechanics because they've played the game for a year and have "grown used to it". Suggestions for different control schemes / camera options are met with "We tried it. Didn't work. End of discussion."\n\nThe best way to describe the current system, where the controls can get reversed on you based upon where your mouse cursor and character are is this: tell someone who is right handed to learn how to throw a ball with their left hand. Tell them to practice practice practice and eventually they will get better, and get the hang of it.... Ignoring the fact that though they may vastly improve from that first day they tried, it will still never really feel natural, and never feel as though their skill will reach the level of their dominant hand.\n\n\n"Story" Mode :\n\nGoing from debris-filled room to debris-filled room, finding damn near nothing of interest, tripping over objects or getting stuck on the environment.... Having to back track and re-trace steps constantly because there's no mini-map of any type, searching for tiny, hard to see keys because they blend in with the drab colour palette.... No way to zoom in half as much as you should be able to...\n\nMouse cursor is not dynamic when hovering over objects... No rhyme or reason to why some objects are movable, and others are not.\n\nThe game is pitch black in a lot of areas which forces you to juggle a torch with your weapon/shield, constantly having to drag it to equip/drop it, but having to be super precise or you "miss" the torch or it won't drop because you dragged it too far away from your character...try doing this while being charged at by a hostile enemy.  The inventory management in this game is absolutely atrocious.  Can't easily drop an item or switch items/weapons, have to click and drag.  You will die because of this, multiple times, and lose hours of progress.  It's bad.\n\nCan't recommend it for story mode,  however, if you have the time/patience/desire, there is definitely something to be said about the arena combat mode.  It seems as though the developers are putting more emphasis on this aspect, so for the price of the game, you're getting potentially a lot of game hours.  Whether or not you're actually enjoying those hours, well, that's the real thing with this game.  A lot of people are going to be way too frustrated after the first hour to even bother going on.  It takes significant time to get decent at the mechanics of this game, so if you don't have the patience, don't bother, you will be smashing that refund button before 2 hours up I guarantee it.\n\nI suggest you look up Sui Generis, a concurrent project the same Developer is working on and has ripped Exanima from in an effort to garner more revenue to fund Sui Generis.  The Developers never planned on Exanima, it only exists because they ran out of money, so they took a few levels from SG, plopped in an arena mode, and voila.  All the original backers of SG received Exanima for free.  Purchasing Exanima does not get you SG, whenever it releases.","May 19, 2015","false","95.4"," 201 of 338 people (59%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","59","201","338","12","37"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FunkyMunkyAus/recommended/362490/","FunkyMunkyAus","Funky Munky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FunkyMunkyAus/","95 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nExanima is the prelude to a game in development called Sui Generis. It is the result of a successful Kickstarter campaign. While Exanima is mainly a dungeon crawler, Sui Generis is the full blown RPG. It is an RPG with a very unique combat and movement system and also features a realistic physics engine which effects every object in the world. Every movement is generated real-time. It can be fun, frustrating, challenging and very rewarding all at the same time. If you're sick of the old hack n slash, click, click, click, attack, kick, block gameplay then this may be a game for you. It requires patience, careful mouse control, intelligence and diligence to succeed.\n\n\nIt is fun playing in the arena with a mate/s (IRL) switching player after each death. The difficulty is on the difficult side for a lot of players these days. It reminds one of videogames during the 80s only with incredible graphics.\nI recommend starting in the arena to try combat before starting a new game. Winning your first fight is a rush. After each fight you can loot the NPC body and take clothing, armour and weapons. Some loot can vastly improve your survivability.\nThere are saves in the game (to a point). Finishing all opponents in the novice arena will permanently unlock access to the expert arena. In the dungeon however you must finish the entire game using one life unless you check the Early Checkpoints box in the options. Early checkpoints will save after completing each level, enabling restarting a level.\n\nThe physics engine effects can make for some very interesting, funny, unique and spectacular moments. Your character (and NPCs) can trip over objects in the world. Objects like tables, chairs and other debris all collide realistically. A fight in a room crowded with objects will usually result in objects being knocked over and flung around all over the place. Picking up objects and placing them carefully can be used to build traps or obstacles for the NPCs to trip over and make themselves vulnerable to attack.\n\nThe mouse cursor controls where your torso faces, WASD control your movement and left-click and hold to attack. Dragging the mouse over the opponent while using good footwork to put power into your attacks. Right click is used to move your character in the direction of the cursor outside of combat.\nDefense is controlled automatically (to an extent). Place the cursor over the direction the attack is coming from to attempt to block it. Attacks that have enough force can still hurt whether you block it or not. A lot of the time avoiding an attack by stepping away is an all round better idea. The speed, angle, force and range of the weapon attacks will affect how much damage is inflicted during attacks.\nMovement during fights is controlled with WASD and can be used to great effect to increase power during attacks. Be careful though, bad footwork will throw you off balance and possibly cause your character to stumble or fall over completely. The movement is also cursor relative. It can take some getting used to. With the cursor on the enemy, pressing W will move you toward the enemy, S will move you away, A and D will sidestep.\n\nFinding items can require a keen eye at times. There is no help given for finding items. YOU have to see them and click on them to pick them up. Sometimes this will require moving objects to search underneath objects or move things to gain access to a door.\nA lot of reviews have made some very harsh criticisms of the controls. While I do not have a problem with them overall, they could use some fine tuning. It is not an easy game to pick up and play. Lazy or bad use of the controls can make your character appear drunk if not done correctly.\nThis game uses OpenGl instead of DirectX, some users have had problems running the game. This issue should be reported and a crashlog posted to get the issue fixed.\n\nThe graphics are brilliant thanks to good use of textures, lighting and colour palette. It looks super realistic. Remarkably they have accomplished this all using very little VRAM resources. Minimum specs to run it are a 512MB GPU.\n\n\n\n\nList of features confirmed to be added to Sui Generis include:\n\nNew weapons\nLAN multiplayer\nPersistant multiplayer\nStealth\nStamina\nThaumaturgy (Magic)\nDismemberment\nObject destruction\nNPC groups\nSkills progression (WIP)\nSpecial moves\nFire\nWater\nDynamic music\nAnimals\nTrading\nNecromancy\nOwnable houses\nThis game is still in early access right now. New features, changes and bugfixes will be coming.

Your character will automatically block or parry so long as you arent swinging and the attack is blockable from where youre facing and where the attack is coming from. The autoblock in this game allows you to focus on offense, instead of thinking about "press mouse2 to block right before he swings". Its second nature to your character to block, so you dont have to think about it. A good way to learn the combat is to play arena for a while. (I gasped so loud when I saw that guy have metal armor, and I beat him and got to take it).\n\n-Indepth hitbox system.\nYou have to really think about hitting the enemy and I dont think any weapon can hit if youre too close, however its a good way to avoid someones attack, get TOO close to them, then back off.\n\n-Rather smart and unique AI.\nWhile playing in arena, the AI was very diverse. Some were aggressive, some were defensive, some were aggressive but very defensive as if trying to counter you but trying to make you do something that can be countered, some AI isnt smart but I think thats part of the point.\n\n-Varied loot.\nIn adventure mode, the enemies and world items spawn with the same loot, but the chests and boxes spawn with different loot each time and the boxes and chests are usually where the good loot is.\n\n-Smooth 60fps and beautiful visuals.\nI dont really care about this stuff, but the visuals in this game are very impressive I have to say.\n\n-Beautiful ambience and sounds.\nAll the sounds feel like they should, none really feel too weak.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Blah blah blah early access\nBasically early access complaints that will be easily fixed later, such as:\nSteam ingame overlay not working when the game is paused.\nCharacters become naked apon startup when starting new games, this is only a problem in arena mode as you lose your weapons and armor that you had before, so if the game crashes which it sometimes does, you lose your progress in that regard. However, if you were able to get that far, you should be able to do it again.\n\n-Red health\nI really love this mechanic, but earlygame is very very frustrating with the stronger enemies. Especially the ones with big axes. One hit can doom you to get destroyed later, and for early game this is a real problem, considering how much armor you DONT get earlygame. But to be fair, I engage in combat more than I should. The only time id argue its a real problem is when combat is forced. For example, the first level has a dark hallway with two guys in it, a guy with some blunt weapon and a guy with a big axe. The guy with the big axe must be killed as he has the key to progress. As much as I like him having the key, I do think maybe he sould have the SMALLER axe? I did manage to get past him but I didnt come out unscathed. I lost about 40% of my total health in one hit.\nBasically I think earlier game enemies should have less lethal damaging weapons, not take them out, just less.\n\n-Map\nYou dont have to, but id really appreciate it. I just dont wana look at a map on the community guide because im afraid itll label enemies and items for me and I just need to figure out some basic direction of where I am. That being said, after running through the same cooridors 10 times while learning the game, I did memorize most of the area, but im good at memorizing areas and someone else might not.\n\n\n\nI love this game, I want multiplayer just like everyone else, preferably online. Im going to keep playing, this is one of the best 15 dollars ive ever spent on steam, and I really really really want it to come out of early access.\nPlease dont let this one sit on early access for years (like starbound *cough cough*), you have something special here and I really want it to be made full. Youve easily made one of my favorite games so far.\n\n100% reccomended.","September 1, 2015","true","43.9"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","26","33","2","5"

Nearly every single aspect of the game has been improved and continues to do so on a regular basis. Bare Mettle releases patches and content updates quite frequently considering the small size of their team.\n\nExanima is one of the most innovative games I've played in the past 20 years. Instead of using static animations characters move based off of motion synthesis (over 200 simulated muscles) which allows for very dynamic gameplay; every single fight plays out in a unique fashion. The physics are also applied to everything in the game so it's possible to use the environment in creative ways, like dropping an item in front of someone to trip them or barricading a door with a bench, thus preventing it from opening.\n\nAnother amazing thing that I haven't seen done before is the accurate collisions which affects gameplay in very significant ways. For example, when using an axe in order to get an effective strike you need to actually land the blow with the head of the axe; hitting with the shaft won't do much damage but it may block an incoming strike or become entangled on the opponent's weapon, body, etc. On the other hand, weapons with long, sharp blades can do drawing cuts with nearly the entire blade length so even small strikes can be quite deadly. Another thing that relates to the accurate collisions is that armor only protects what it actually covers (and armor can be layered on top of each other in realistic ways).\n\nThe game will not hold your hand and it encourages the player to think before acting. In the story mode it's up to you to figure out what's going on by paying attention to your surroundings (things are very deliberately placed and everything has a purpose for existing which can give you clues), reading texts/books/scrolls/parchment, etc. As you start to piece together the bits of lore it leaves you wanting more, to keep pressing on so you can find more clues to determine if you really have figured things out or if you're being misled (perhaps intentionally, perhaps unintentionally). The dark, eerie atmosphere combined with never knowing what may be lurking around the next corner really creates a suspenseful gameplay experience which drew me in from the start and kept me glued to my seat the entire time.\n\nIf you're just wanting some instant action they've also added a completely separate Arena mode which allows you to fight in many different match types, hire recruits/hirelings to fight with or alongside you, purchase and upgrade gear, etc. I've sunk many hours into the arena and it's basically like having two games in one (the arena could be an entire game of its own). Eventually there will be low latency multi-player PvP and co-op modes in both the arena and story modes which will further increase the game's replayability factor.\n\nIf any of this sounds like it may be the type of game you're interested in I highly recommend you give Exanima a try :). Just be patient and try not to get too frustrated when starting out; due to the complexity of the game it does have a rather steep learning curve. If you are cautious and make decisions based off what you would do in real life then you should be okay.","May 17","true","0.3"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","0"

I was initially hesitant on my purchase, as it wouldn't be the first time Early Access has f**ked me. But hey, it was on sale for $10 and I've grown pretty tired of shooting things in the face. Looked like a neat little dungeon crawler. Nothing overly ambitious, but charming at best, I thought. A friend of mine was playing it, so I inquired, and did some market research, as I do before buying a game (#protip). He lamented how the game was "different", mentioning that everything was physics. Well, a lot of games have physics, ... Anyway, I bought it.\n\nGood God, did I not expect what this game was. The store page has a disclaimer on what you're getting. There are videos / etc of the movement / battle mechanics. Now, I may just be numbed out from all the shooters, rpgs, etc, but this game IS different. I got my ♥♥♥ handed to me within the first 4 minutes. Frantically clicking away, trying to kill one guy, only to be bested time and time again. This is where I'd normally click 'refund' and say f**k this s**t for life. But this game is crack, so I spent, literally, six hours in the games practice mode to learn the controls. This game makes you relearn how to ride a damn bike, and that there is what I'd call innovative. A lot of games make that claim, but they're f**king liars. Exanima doesn't even match a genre of game out there, because it's like 12. Sort of like a rouge-like, isometric, action RPG, dungeon crawler, strategy, rage-educing, panic-simulator. Or, If Dark Souls, Diablo II, and QWOP had a baby, decided they weren't responsible parents, aborted, and let Satan make a game out of the after [un]birth. And I love it.\n\nThis has to be one of my new favorite games, as the time I've invested in it has ultimately given me a sense of satisfaction. I feel as if my character is an extension of myself, which feels weird to say, but it's like you [your character] is alone in this world, and you have no idea where you are, why you're there, or what to do. Before I said it's easy to get lost, but it's that sense of 'I'm lost' that you as the player feel, and have to imagine your character would feel very much the same. Those foot steps you hear ahead could mean death, and you might be afraid to move forward, or panic try to escape. It's almost serendipitous. Not many games have the power to evoke a real world emotional response, and it's really quite thrilling. For a beta, and essentially a prequel for anther project, Sui Generis, Exanima is really shaping up to be an amazing game. Challenging, but nonetheless a great piece of work. Bravo Bare Mettle.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the latest update (0.6.2.0 at time of writing) really cleans up the combat, and has overall improved the experience. The new 'k.o.' feature is nice, but doesnt always save you, but at least you can -try- to save yourself.\n\nI'd recommend this to anyone who likes a challenge and/or is bored of convention, by the numbers RPGs. Also to single moms who have enough stress in life, so why not add video game perma-death anxiety on top of  it.\n\n-Arena- [short ver.]\nI initially didn't say much about the games 'Arena' mode, as, well, I forgot to. As follows:\nAs much as I like to praise the ambition of the core game, Arena in itself is a little busted. It's a beta, yeah, I know. The fighting mechanics are identical to the main game, and perma-death is still in play. You can regain heath after a victory, or hire / recruit a new contender to fight while your main character is on the mend. That's a lovely feature, and adds some mercy to an extent. You wont always win, but you don't always have to die. All in all, it's just a fun sort-of mini game, and can be quite addictive. For blood and glory.\n\nPro~\n+ It has the addictive qualities of heroin. Except if you die, you want revenge instead of an ambulance.\n+ While simple in it's own right, the music is atmospheric and really enhances the mood of the game\n+ Each fight is unpredictable, and victory is satisfying every time.\n+ There isn't an over complicated story, and the little bit you get makes you piece it together. It works.\n+ The physics (that word again) allow almost total interaction with the world.\n+ The layered armor system is great, and uses practical equipment. 'Metal thongs' need not apply.\n+ Sticking to a favored weapon, and honing you skills is almost magical.\n+ Arena is fun, and just as rewarding when you axe a guy.\n\nNeut~\n= The learning curve for combat is pretty steep. But once you learn it, you love it.\n= The control scheme takes a bit to get a handle on. Longer to be competent at. Longer so to use effectively.\n= Cheap deaths are going to happen, but it's all relative. 'Get good' actually applies here.\n= The skill system is while unfinished, is simplistic, and easy to use. Killing a guy wont make you better at alchemy.\n= The free-form inventory is based on weight, not square slots, like Diablo /etc. But can easily be cluttered.\n= Arena is still janky, but fuctions well enough. Hope to see MP added >:D\n\nCon~\n- VERY easy to get lost. Especially when  looking for a locked door that you probably have the wrong key for.\n- No map, or even a mechanic to orient yourself, aside from a compass. Which only helps in minimal terms.\n- Some of the 'puzzles' border on tedium, and aren't really fun or necessary to solve.\n- The Arena store is needlessly expensive. You likely die before saving up for anything good.\n\n\nTL;DR -\nFor a develpoment title, what you see is what you get. If you read the above, then you can decide if it's worth your time, money, and tears. It's risky to try something new in gaming, but Bare Mettle is nailing it. Color me impressed.","February 28","true","31.1"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","79","23","29","7","6"

At least, that's the way it seems.\n\nSo, the very, very short and vague instructions don't really tell you how to play the game.  I'm actually happy for games like that that let you figure it out for yourself.  But, not when key points of how to play the very limited range of the game aren't explained (like how to attack other people, for example).\n\nThe graphics are nicer than I expected\nThe sound is relatively inconspicuous but helps set the mood of being in a dungeon of sorts\nThe learning curve for playing the game is relatively high and may require some youtubing in order to figure out\nAs far as the gameplay... let's just say it's fairly punishing and takes some getting used to.\nCombat is basically luck of the draw.  If you happen to get the last hit in, you win.  Otherwise it's like flailing at each other with wet noodles until you get the hang of it.  Then it's like flailing at each other with wet cardboard.\n\n\nDon't forget to open your inventory when you pick something up to actually take it.\nDon't forget that the combat interaction button IS NOT the combat button... that's the "turn toward cursor" button\nThe ability to learn how to dash can't be understated... because it's OP.  And, literally, is the only thing you need to learn how to do beyond opening doors and figuring out what to pick up.\nCombat can be totally ignored... for all 3 levels...  So, it's not really like the videos they have out there that include fighting all the time.\n\nSo, there you have it.  I'll recommend it, but I don't recommend you buy it for more than a few dollars...  Even when they get the issues figured out.  It's still a very shallow experience that only has one purpose:  Escape.  And you literally can just run through the entire thing to do so.","May 5, 2015","true","0.5"," 54 of 84 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","54","84","4","0"

Examina does not hold your hand, expect to spend a few hours learning how combat works in the arena (I found myself looking up tutorials online), but overall it has been a thriling adventure.

Obvious","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198081367411/","147 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDrunk Warrior Simulator. 10/10\n\nMore serious review below.\n\n\nExamina is a unique game. Instead of using a bunch of pre-set animations, it treats everything as a physics object. Your character is essentially a ragdoll that you puppet around with the mouse. The result is a strange mixture of Dark Souls and Amnesia: The Dark Descent.  Attention to historical accuracy when it comes to Medieval armor, weapons, and techniques means that this game gives a great visual example of what two professional warriors would really look like fighting in the Middle Ages...if they were completely hammered.\n\nPros:\n> Very original concept.\n> Not very glitchy, considering it's Early Access.\n> Creepy, morbid atmosphere--reminds me of Dark Souls and Amnesia: The Dark Descent.\n> Nearly everything can be interacted with, much like with Amnesia.\n> Physics are pretty realistic.\n> AI is pretty smart.\n> Very historically accurate. It looks like the devs really did their research.\n> Showcases some types of Medieval weapons and armors you don't often see in video games. Again, clearly a lot of research went into the making of this game.\n> Very challenging. Even once you get the hang of the combat, more than one "weak" enemy can easily overwhelm you. Again, reminds me of Dark Souls, one of my favorite game franchises. Very rewarding when you finally figure out how to outsmart your opponent and crush his skull with a mace after a long fight.\n> Has a few elements that are similar to Rogue-likes. You start out the Adventure mode with no equipment and have to collect gear bit by bit as you go. Some of the items are always in the same places, but other items are randomized. You might find a battleaxe in this room one playthrough, and then there might be a padded vest or a mace in that room in the next playthrough.\n> Armor really, really matters, especially if you don't have a shield.\n\nCons:\n> Sometimes crashes during loading screens.\n> Took me about five hours before I undertood the combat system well enough to actually kill an enemy. It's pretty awkward and unintuative, but that's sort of to be expected with a completely new type of game. Takes a long time to get used to.\n> Characters look a bit 'drunk', especially while fighting. This doesn't bother me, because I don't see how you could avoid that in a game where you puppet ragdolls to swordfight, but it might be a bit off-putting to other players.\n> Perma-death. Again, this doesn't bother me--in fact, I like it--but less hardcore players might find it annoying. You can enable checkpoints, but they're very hard to get to, so you'll still have characters perminately die many times before you reach one.","August 10, 2015","true","41.9"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","19","24","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elaxter/recommended/362490/","elaxter","elaxter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elaxter/","76 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAhh Exanima. This is an updated version of my previous review for this game. I'm going to try to be as objective as possible in this one.\n\nSUMMARY Exanima is the ambitious project being developed by Bare Mettle Entertainment. It serves as a prelude and fully-functioning tech demo for Sui Generis - more on the tech demo part later. It was developed to give those who had backed the original project, Sui Generis, a chance to experience the combat first hand and then flourished to include what it has today. Everything that you see in Exanima is going to be pasted over to Sui Generis, and Sui Generis is going to have the full package. Think of Exanima as a very thorough demo that showcases everything that you can expect from Sui Generis.\n\nGAMEPLAY Exanima has the most unique combat engine that I've encounted yet. Think Mount & Blade meets Physics class. You control your character's torso with your mouse cursor, and you attack with your left mouse button. The game uses a 360 degree isometric camera (top down, at an angle). The way your character moves is based on your cursor, not your camera. For example, no matter which way your camera is facing, 'A' - which is right - will always move your character to the right. This might be tricky at first, but actually allows for more advanced maneuvers such as circling your opponent. Again, it's a very tricky system, but after a while you get used to it and it fits like a glove.\n\nCombat can become the major turn off in the game. At first, I was skeptical of this game's success. The combat seemed wonky and sluggish, and the AI seemed too good at making hits. But as I got better, and the developers improved animations and gameplay mechanics, the game became easier. I still die, but I can handle myself in combat better because I learned from my mistakes.\n\nQuite honestly, this game is not for everyone. You have to accept dying, and have to think of your character's suffering as fun. It requires distancing from your character, and the only comparable experience is Dwarf Fortress. In other words: "losing is fun."\n\nSTORY, ATMOSPHERE, ETC If story is your bag, look no further. Exanima has a "you're just walking into it" type story. You find scrolls and books laying around detailing the world that you stumbled into. A world of confusion, of labor, and of death. As the game is finished, more story content will be added. As of writing, Exanima has recieved a massive update including a new level, fixes, and armor.\n\nThe atmosphere in this game is top notch. The books, scrolls, objects, and locations make it feel alive, but now long abandoned. The many rooms feel as if they had a purpose. You'll find a cobbler workshop, blacksmith, sleeping quarters, bar, etc.\n\nThe graphics are amazing. The game in its current state is very well optimized; however, you have to worry about the processor. If it's not good enough, you will have issues such as slow-motion/fast-motion, causing a very unpleasant experience. If your processor isn't top notch, or you're experiencing problems, try running the game in high priority mode.\n\nI have the game on the lowest setting and it looks really great and runs at a smooth 60fps on my not-so-good Laptop. If you want a game that not only looks good, but performs well, Exanima is your choice.\n\nDEVELOPERS With many Early Access games, the devs seem distant. With Bare Mettle, they seem like they are personally involved in the game. Some may not agree with their "it's our game" approach, but I find that respectable, especially in today's market where many games get dumbed down for the average gamers due to the complaints of the majority. It shows that they are faithful enough to handle developing the game themselves, and don't really care what people think. Answer this: Did Pink Floyd ask their fans for help when writing their songs? Did Quentin Tarantino care if Pulp Fiction was too violent?\n\nCONS - Combat is extremely unforgiving. This is a massive turn off for those who want an easy experience.\n- It's unfinished. The game is really short once you figure out the combat, and new areas will take time. There is a lack of unique loot and the skill system is mostly unfinished.\n- Slow updates. As the game gets more complex, natually so will the updates. Luckily the devs keep in contact with their fans to a degree.\n- REALLY HARD! If you plan to purchace this game, educate yourself before you buy it. It's a tough game and it really one of the draw backs.\n- A complete gamble. Like most Early Access games, this game shows huge potential; despite my faith in the company, the game could flop on release.\n- The controls are still wonky. The devs are putting their efforts into making it smoother, and they are better than they were. However, they are still wonky and that needs to be addressed.\n- Story. Even though I said that there is a good story, it might not be the story most gamers are into. It's vague, much like Dark Souls, and it doesn't really relate to the character at all.\n- Bugs. There are bugs in the game. Mainly they are visual and very rarely affect the gameplay.\n- Reworking. There is a lot of stuff being reworked. Namely the blocking system. Nothing is really set in stone.\n\nOVERALL\nOverall this game gets a 9/10. Its orginal presentation and massive potential warrents award alone.\n\nEdits\n- Fixed minor gramatical errors and improved flow.\n- Added bit about computer processors.","November 10, 2015","true","29.3"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","21","28","2","1"

It seemed really nice dungeon crawler in dark athmosphere and is exactly that, for that matter, I got my money's worth. Kudos to the studio for the athmosphere they've created. Also, before I get further, I should mention I play the story/campaign mode. There's a grim story to explore, one that gives hints on past events in journals and books, haven't gotten to the bottom of it yet. Also the combat system is plan awesome and nothing I've played thus far. It will take some time to get used to, but after you get the hang of it, you wouldn't change it to anything else and wish more games would have something similar. You really can feel the difference between poking an enemy with a stick and piledriving his head with a sledgehammer.\n\nSo I got everything I was hoping for and more, why not recommended? Roguelike. No, roguelikes aren't bad games, I love them, they don't pat you in the head and make you feel like speacial snowflake like the cesspit of casual games. But this game beign roguelike is bad. Let me explain it this way:\n\n1. Your first run will probably be something like, run around, try moves, meet first hostile enemy, maybe kill him, maybe don't, but probably die of at least the second enemy. No biggie, this was fun, let's do it again! Time spent on your character before death: 3-7min\n\n2. You get better at this, find finally some gear and a proper weapon, actually get further in the dungeon. But you still get beatings every now and then, bit by bit the health bar drops and it isn't going to refill in this game (yes, there are like, 2 healing potions in the entire game...). Eventually you die, start from the start again. Time spent on character before death: 20-120min. This phase repeats over and over again until you either get tired of the game as it becomes a burdensome chore to do the same starting grind over and over and over and over again, or get to phase 3.\n\n3. You get maybe at the next dungeon segment! That's sort of a checpoint, so good on that. Repeat phase 2 over and over and over again with your new checkpoint ability. Normal mob zombies become more of a chore than an enemy. Maybe eventually you'll get to next tier of dungeon where you meet faster zombies with more armor and first skeletons in plate armor and claymores, go to part 4.\n\n4. And that's where I stopped playing. I can accept defeat in (roguelike) games when it is clear that I failed either by lack of skill or beign stupid. With this game, defeat is constantly caused by the beforementioned skeletons and faster zombies. No matter what weapon I used, their attacks were always faster, reached further and hit like a truck. Either I had my block up and couldn't attack, or attacked and became vulnerable. This, while battling camera angles that insisted on putting foreground objects in front of the battle. Always when I thought I had the upper hand (which happened like, 1 out of 10 times) in battle and was doing some damage, another patrolling skeleton came along and quickly finished my hopes of winning the battle. In the end I think I might have figured out a proper way to fight them, given opportunity to try different weapon and tactic combinations, but as it took some 40min to clear the dungeon of normal mobs to make it to the skeletons, I really wasn't interested investing the time. Every time I had to clear my way back to them I became more frustrated with it, doing silly mistakes which led me to getting wounded by normal mobs that in otherwise wouldn't have happened, further reducing my chances of beating the skeletons.\n\nLong story short, I never felt like I died because of lack of skill, more because of game suddenly throwing steroid junkie enemies and his buddies to your face.\n\nOh ye, side note about using different weapon combos: Better get used to using 1h weapon + torch combo only, 80% of the dungeon has no other light source. Best 1h weapon I found was a wooden board you'll find in your spawning room, as absurd as that is. It has the best speed/reach ratio, which I found the best way to get things done with block/dodge & retaliate playstyle.\n\nI'd hope this game would in the future have a save function. Or non-vertical difficulty curve in completely random spot. At least as an optional feature, which you don't have to use if you're a better player than me and want the roguelike experience.\n\n+Combat system is amazing\n+Athmosphere is good\n+Combat system is damn amazing\n\n-Deaths in traps you can only figure out with trial and error. Start a new game.\n-Fight a hostile mob next to peceful mob, peaceful mob thinks you're attacking it, get cornered and flanked, die. Start a new game.\n-Dude with claymore hit you dead from behind corner you couldn't see because of camera. Start a new game.\n-While manouvering in battle, get in patrol route of 2 more enemies, pull them, get flanked, die. Start a new game.\n-Chase feeling enemy, pull 5 more enemies while at it, die. Start a new game.\n-Don't chase a fleeing enemy, continue life, get in new fight. Fleeing enemy returns, flanks you, die. Start a new game.\n-Vertical difficulty curve enemy appears. Die. Start a new game.\n-Eventually die of all the stacked damage. Start a new game.\n\nTLDR; Good game till it starts beign an a**.","February 11","false","21.4"," 38 of 59 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","38","59","7","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KleineErdbeere/recommended/362490/","KleineErdbeere","Little Strawberry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KleineErdbeere/","490 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBeautiful RPG with gritty and grim aesthetics, as well as a really tactile and enjoyable inventory system. You could waste hours into honing your skill with the original combat system and the minimal UI almost seems perfect.\n\nUnfortunately it tries to be one thing, while it actually is another.\n\nAt its core, it has pretty good combat mechanics that make every encounter deadly, but mostly optional. Your mouse also is able to interact with the objects in the game world, letting you scavenge through rooms looking underneath objects which often rewards you with something. The rooms look filled with sensible clutter that convey the idea of that people once used to live in them.\n\nWhat the developer wants it to be, is a static dungeon crawling experience for ~14 levels (Not even half of them are in the game right now) with an alleged focus on puzzles and enviromental clues that tells of a story.\n\nThis is weird, because it does not have compelling puzzles that used to be in older RPG's and Dungeon Crawlers, the most exciting ones are timed buttons and that's about as deep as it gets. On top of that, it used to have permadeath until it changed to checkpoints after X of every level, which is kind of bizarre because the maps are static as well as placements. Those concepts conflict with each other, because what you're getting right now is a gauntlet that you run over and over again with absolute no dynamic element to it. The game gives you a great sense of exploration and imminent danger, but when you die more than once on the same level it loses all of its charm. You start running past every enemy and only picking up the necessities on the way. Dark Souls avoids this problem for the most part, by giving you a very rich experience and often a reward for dispatching enemies because there are multiple systems in place that give it depth and purpose, as well as a rather original death system. What ended up happening in Exanima, is that I really enjoyed the first 20 minutes, until I've died once and that point it lost all of its charm and mysticism, making me speedrun the whole 3 levels it offered at that point. Not because I hated the idea of dying, but because I knew that there was nothing I would need or want in any of the rooms as I've already been to them.\n\nThe only way to make it enjoyable in its current form, is by making an original death system that persists through checkpoints in some way or to turn it into a procedually generated roguelike and play to its strengths, which is its combat and the gratification of exploration and loot with random traps and its current basic puzzles.\nIt honestly plays like I Wanna Be The Guy, because all you do is run past enemies, pick up the same gear you've been picking up for the 20th time and if you magically die (Good luck with that if you're just running past everything) then you have the enjoyment of doing the same thing again, with no sense of progression because there's zero knowledge you need in your first playthrough that you otherwise would've gained with experience in playing any other game.\n\nIt tries to be something it's not very good at, while neglecting what makes it good. Perhaps it's just my own bitterness in knowing that this would've made an amazing roguelike, that I can't really recommend this.","May 16","false","1.1"," 113 of 197 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","113","197","5","15"

It's rare nowadays to find a video game that can be described as innovative. I believe that Exanima, or Sui Generis as it will eventually become, is exactly that.\n\nWhat makes this game different is that it uses a very unique combat system that's entirely physics-driven. For a powerful attack, it requires weight and momentum behind it, along with connecting the correct part of your weapon with the enemy. There is no such thing as button mashing in this game. Within minutes of trying the combat for the first time you will see why. Button mashing, or in this case, continuing to hold the left click, will result in a weak display of tapping the enemy with your weapon and finding yourself dead shortly afterward. Each attack requires you to turn and move your character to put your body weight into the swing, and be at the proper distance to connect with the enemy. Too close, and you'll hit them with the haft or bump into them awkwardly. Too far, and you'll swing wide due to the momentum and leave yourself open to attack. This is very much like real life. No person wielding a melee weapon will stand rigid and swing it with just their arms. Weight and force is placed behind a weapon swing through the hip and torso rotation, foot placement, and overall movement of the body (stepping forward along with a swing), all combined with the motion of the arms themselves.\n\nEach battle ends up a frantic and tense endeavor, but also feels very real and organic. Battles move around as you dodge and maneuver, which in turn causes the scenery to come into play. Attack too close to a wall, and your attack will bounce off and be interrupted. Try to move around some debris on the floor, and you might trip and fall, leaving yourself open to a deadly overhead chop.\n\nIt took me about an hour to get used to the combat and start to be able to sense the flow of it, but once I have, I couldn't be more excited to get the full release of this game. Combined with the satisfying and unique combat, the entire game in the single player mode has a dark, bleak, and cruel feel to it. You explore what seems to be an abandoned prison filled with roaming undead, scavenging gear and discovering subtle lore while trying to escape. It DEFINITELY does NOT hold your hand in any way. I compare it to Dark Souls in this aspect.\n\nIn summary, this game requires actual skill to play, and is very unforgiving. These are both positive things. If you, like myself, are sick of how cliche, hollow, and unsatisfying modern day games have become, I have a feeling you will enjoy this. This is a game for people who want a legitimate challenge, who enjoy realism or physics-based gameplay, and who enjoy a dark/low-fantasy themed RPG setting.","May 5, 2015","true","25.0"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

Right away, slot this in every corner of your mind.Being hard doesn't mean its bad tho, its an early glimpse at an amazing sunrise, the more patient you are the bigger and more beautiful the payout.\n\nIf you ever played Dark Souls or Demon Souls, recall the first time you played it and how you feel in love with its brutal nature. That same feeling kept creeping up on me and it hooked me. The combat is unforgiving if you just spam your mouse, but when you land that perfect follow thru attack...the bliss you feel is unrivaled. The environment can be your greatest ally or your biggest foe, being trapped behind a door with multiple enemies waiting on the outside its both hilarious and daunting. The atmosphere is on a horror game level, that makes you wonder if a jump scare is coming. A jumpscare never comes but an enemy willing to beat you into a pulp could be hiding in that next dark hallway. All this...is just one game mode, the "story" mode.\n\nThe arena mode, where I spent most of my time is a whole other beast. You dual npc enemies with various weapons ranging from swords, shields, mace,sickles and bigger swords. This is where you hone your ability to fight in the other story based mode but the combat is so brutal and satisfying, you will stick around for the beatings to come.","May 1, 2015","true","6.4"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

And I can honestly say that Sui Generis and Exanima is the rpg I have been waiting for my entire life.\n\nExanima's most unique aspect is the combat. It's something you have to play to really understand and it's the best melee combat I've ever played. Something that I have been longing for forever.\n\nBut combat is only a small part of the game's excellence. Some dispatched the game based on early videos as just a technical demo of drunken combat, but they couldn't have been further from the truth. Bare Mettle(the devteam) have an unwavering vision of a game that provides a living world unlike any other game. Currently this can be seen in the focus on atmosphere, detail, world and storytelling in Exanima, but take a look at the dynamic systems planned for Sui Generis and you may understand the huge scope of their detailed and living world where everything has a meaning.\n\nFor a starter the combat's movement, camera and overall gameplay may seem overwhelming and very difficult because it truly is innovative and something never seen before. But don't panic! I've seen countless people first raging about it's impossibility and bad design, only to come back and apologise a bit later when they've gotten used to it. Truly the combat is a real skill that you have to learn, train and sleep on before you get anywhere. It can take hours before you feel competent, but it's all fun even when you are learning the basics.\n\nI want to give a big hug to Bare Mettle(and especially Madoc the main dev who coded the whole engine and game by himself) for developing a rpg the world has long been in need for. They are amazing devs who actively communicate with the community on the forums and every post they make shines with their professional commitment and supreme vision for a game that defies all the gamey tropes of this days rpg's.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theivanator/recommended/362490/","theivanator","Ivan Ivanovich Ivanowsky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theivanator/","79 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n(I'm rewriting my old review because my old review was terrible.)\n\nI'm not sure I've ever felt so engaged in a fight system before in my life.\n\nThere are a few things you have to understand in order to have a fun time with this game.\nFirst off, you have to understand the controls. Go into the practice arena mode, have a few fighs. Or, hell, go into the real Arena mode, grab a weapon, got the hub area, and just swing around a weapon at the training dummies. You have to learn the controls. You just HAVE to. If you think "ah, it'll be fine", go into the Dungeon, and get killed by the first enemy, I'm going to be very upset with you if you write a negative review with 30 minutes of game time citing "bad controls" as your reasoning. Shame.\n\nSecond of all, you have to understand that you will STILL DIE. Whaaaat? Yeah, I know.  Blew my mind. When I beat the novice arena I thought I was hot stuff until I took on two enemies at once and was bed-panned to death. Yes, bed-panned.\n\nThird of all, and perhaps most importantly for enjoying this game, is that the characters in this world, the dungeon, and the inhabitants of it, existed before your character. You have to understand that you, the player, are not the focus of this world. That the Dungeon existed before, will exist alongside you, and will exist after you've left. This game is not player-centric. You are merely dropped into this world as a player, just as your character was mercilessly dropped into the horrible Dungeon. The mysterious rotten inhabitants were there BEFORE you. They aren't there to just to kill you, they aren't there just so you can get EXP. They are there because of reasons in the story you can only understand if you look.\n\nFourth, not all of the enemies are hostile straight off. Infact, the AI of the game is pretty stellar. They are programmed with expertise to act realistically stupid. They can become accustomed to your presence, they can become threatened based on your actions, they will attack if they feel they have the chance. It's really good.\n\nOkay, so now let's get onto what this game has to offer.\n\n-An excellent learning curve.\nIt was a blast to learn this game.\n\n-A deep and well unfolded lore.\nFinding letters, piecing together environments and character locations, (I think that all of the "enemies" are really their own characters) and all that jazz is really fun. This place feels as alive as a dungeon full of dead people should be.\nHm. That doesn't sound right.\n\nYou'll get what I mean if you play it.\n\n-The most engaging combat system. (At least, from my experience)\nThe intense physics of the fights, how unpredictable yet predictable they are... it's amazing. The fights feel so personal. I've said insults to the inhabitants of the dungeon while playing this game. And not through rage, just because I got so into it. I cannot stess enough how stellar the combat is. It's intense. It can be stressful, if you let it get to you, so just remind yourself that it IS a game every once in a while. But that'll be hard because...\n\n-It's incredibly immersive.\nThe physics, lighting, lore, non player-centricity (centricity? eh, whatever) of this world sucked me in and kept me trapped there like...like... like a vacuum made out of jello.\nLet's go with that.\n\n-An arena!\nNot only does this game have a little practice arena for 1v1 fights (just for practice and fun), it also has an Arena mode. Permanent characters, buying equipment, hiring mercenaries, and a plethora of game modes. One of my favorites is Fray, which is a six-gladiator free for all.\n\n-Updates\nThis game is actively being developed. Don't expect weekly updates, they are infrequent. However, when they do come, they always add something substantial to the game to keep you playing until the next one. Even if you run out of story content, you can always just play the arena mode (which is also being updated!!!).\n\n-Different every time\nPeople often complain that because the dungeon is "static", that every playthrough is the same. I argue differently. I've never had a fight take the same course. I've made friends with some of the inhabitants some times, only to have them turn on me other times. One of my favorite moments is when I had a fight in what looked like some sort of restaraunt tavern area. Cups, bowls, board games, and wooden stools flying every where as me and this "zombie" attempted to battle each other in this hectic environment. It was great.\n\n-Beyond the portal\nThe first three levels take place in a dungeon. The time I become good enough to beat all three levels took upon me suddenly. My playthroughs never got me past the first area of the first level. Then, suddenly, in one life, I took myself all the way through. There's also checkpoints throughout the first three levels, so you can still continue playing until you get to the portal. The momentum you can pick up is astounding for the first three levels.\n\nThe portal changes everything. Suddenly you realize that everything before this has been a tutorial for what lies beyond that glowing blue entrance. And it is. I won't spoil anything, but things get pretty crazy. By the third level, you may think this game is getting too easy. I did. The portal...let's just say the fourth level changed my mind.\n\nNegatives?\nI have to talk about negatives, I guess.\n\nFirst negative...\nWell...\nI mean it can be hard.\nDifficult.\nChallenging.\nBut never unfair.\nWell, see, now it's not a negative anymore.\nHonestly, for what this game sets out to accomplish, it does so perfectly. This game has a niche audience, if you don't happen to fit into that audience, don't feel bad. Another thing, the people who play Dark Souls and the people who play Exanima are not one and the same. I'm not a big fan of Dark Souls, but I love this game. Some people like both games, some people like one or the other, some people like neither. That's just how it is with all games.\n\nBut, for people like me, I enjoyed the game the minute I started playing.","May 29","true","55.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","1"

If you love 3d topdown, and you like a challenge, this game is perfect. There is a steep learning curve, but I found every hour spent learning the game mechanics very enjoyable. Admittedly, the physics/controls are a bit annoying at times but they're also pretty funny. I enjoyed watching my proud, solemn knight trip over a bucket and faceplant, or make an about-turn into a wall and fall over. While the controls get easier with practice, you should expect your character to look pretty wasted until you get the hang of them.\n\nI'll be following this game with a keen eye. It has extraordinary potential, and will give you a fun, bug free experience as it stands.\n\n*Tips for playing the game: spend a couple of hours in the arena. I found the polearm to be the most effective. In the actual game, run away from the zombies/shut them into rooms (they can't open doors) until you find some good gear. When you are fully armored, damage only depletes stamina (this regenerates, but you die when it hits 0).","June 25, 2015","true","17.9"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

The game tries to introduce real physics based melee combat and it succeeds in a high degree. Every little detail counts, the weight of your armor, the weight of your weapon will have a huge impact on the way your character moves and fights. Going around smashing your keys will get you nowhere. To survive in Exanima you must proceed carefully, think your next move and try to plan ahead.\nThe world in which Exanima takes place is the second best thing about the game. You find yourself locked inside a dark dungeon, with absolutely no idea of what is going on or why you are there. It is up to you to push forward and start collecting clues and items that will help you understand the story of this place and in the end survive and escape the dungeon. Every little room, every corridor in Exanima is fully interactive and you have to search under every crate or in every shell in order to find useful information and objects. The dungeon is dark and creepy but the game does not have any horror elements, providing jumpscares is not what Exanima is trying to achieve.\nObviously, going around searching for clues, is not as easy as it sounds. There are others locked in this dungeon as well. Most of them will ignore you, but there are some that will try to stop and kill you. This is where you have to use your sword, your axe or whatever else you have found already and using as your weapon. But combat is not the only way to move forward. Exanima allows you to outsmart your enemies or even outrun them and avoid conflict if that is what you desire.\nExanima offers a unique experience not only with the main game, where you try to find the exit of a dark dungeon but also with the arena mode. In arena you will have the opportunity to test different weapons and fight against opponents that use various other weapons and a plethora of tactics to take you down. In there you will have the possibility to test your skills and become better. Something that will help you in the main game a lot.\nExanima is the prelude to Sui Generis, an open world RPG, and it gives us a first look at the dark and unforgiving world of this upcoming game. At the moment, the main game does not have a lot of content to offer but the amazing combat system, the fully interactive environments and the general dark atmosphere make Exanima a must buy for fans of the genre and everyone that is looking for a great challenge.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and found it helpful, then please consider following my curator page.

Should you wait until Sui Generis? Absolutely not. Exanima, unlike most Early Access games, feels complete, polished and worthwhile. Here's why:\n\nExanima is genuinely one of my favourite games, which seems like a good start to a review. It's incredibly atmospheric, nail-bitingly tense and, above all else, completely satisfying. Starting off in a dungeon with nothing but some flimsy clothes, you have to scavenge and gather increasingly powerful gear, fighting your way through until you, hopefully, find an exit. I assume there's an exit, anyway, despite the 2 weeks I spent playing the game, I still didn't complete it.\n\nAll of this is done through entirely physics-based animation. The walking/running and the combat is all managed by physics, meaning you can stumble over clutter around the room which leads to either hilarious results, or your death in combat. The combat itself, however, is the most unique I've seen in any game. As you swing your weapon you have to manually twist your body to generate more force behind the swing, dealing more damage. When the enemy attacks you will have to manually position your body to either dodge or block the attack. And the enemies act exactly the same, meaning you will have to time your attacks to get in between the enemies defence and deal damaging blows. Each battle is totally unique from the last, as enemies move differently, attack in different patterns and react to the world around them.

Even low level enemies right at the start of the game can beat you to death if you don't pay attention.\n\nThe game has a tough learning curve. Upon launching the game you get a warning "This game is unlike others, throw away all expectations." It's not lying, and when I first played it, I ignored it. As I stumbled through doors and drunkenly fell over rubble in Goat Simulator levels of hilarity, I could have put this game down and said "Wellp, dumbest game I've ever played." Stick with it. Seriously. Once you get to grips with it you will be able to perform some fantastic moves and defeat enemies quicker and quicker. And it will all be because of your skill, not because you pressed X at the right time like most other games.\n\nAnd then there's the arena, a battleground to test out your combat against a series of enemies with increasing levels of gear and skills. I spent far too long fighting and dying and fighting and dying until I reached the final "boss". It was a heart pounding battle rivalled only by Ornstein and Smough in Dark Souls, and the satisfaction of defeating him was just the same.\n\nAlso, if things get too tough, you can put a bucket on your own head, or drop a chair on an enemy to throw him off balance.

First there is world exploration. The main campaign is set in the underworld, a large system of tunnels, chambers and basements, in which your self-created protagonist wakes up after crashing through the ceiling. With little more than the clothes on your body, a mysterious half-torn note and a torch you set out to explore your surroundings... Everything is interactive by simply grabbing it with the mouse, so you turn around the boxes and barrels and your quest for anything you can use. Maybe grab a piece of debris as a makeshift weapon, a barrel lid as your first shield and enter the hallway in front of you... Soon, you meet the lavyrinths inhabitants, animated corpses who roam the corridors. Some of them seem to ignore you, others maybe startled by your presence, and some are outright hostile. Suddenly you are forced to fight for your life, either by desperately using the few things you have at hand, or by making a run for it throwing chairs, ladders and everything you can grab in your pursuer´s way... The game engine and physical simulation allows for all kinds of creative behavior.\nAfter overcoming the first obstacles, you slowly start to gather new weapons, armor and other useful things. And at some point you realize that you aren´t simply exploring some video game level, but a functional, realistic setting. You search through cupboards in storage rooms, stumble over washing buckets in bathrooms and find a new hammer in an apparent lumber mill. No, that epic sword will not be hidden inside a toilet stall... but keep your eyes open and use your brain. Everything you find feels valuable and as soon as your own survival is secured, you start to uncover the history of this place... who build it? What happened to the inhabitants? How did you get here? ... maybe time will tell ...\n\n\nThe other large portion of the game is the combat. Exanima´s melee is unlike anything seen in other video games. There are no set animations, every action is the exact result of player input and subtle mouse movement is all that is required. Wider movements leads to wider, harder but slower blows; diagonal movement can cause diagonal cut;, slash for your enemies legs or his head, step into his blow and block his arm so he cannot strike you, riposte his slash, run him over or trip him or strike his unprotected body parts: Yes, the game even simulates armor in detail; everything you wear only protects the parts of your body it actually covers; but armor can be worn in layers with the super simple drag-on system...\nFace opponents of various skill levels, from the blunt undead with no sense of self-preservation to the hardened swordmaster in the game´s arena mode. Enemy difficulty is not determined by higher stats, but by how well they master their weapon. Every combatant has different skills and his or her own style of fighting: Watch, adapt, overcome, even if it will take you a while.\n\n... and this is where I mention the issue some people have with the game: Due to Exanima´s vastly different approach to combat, it really takes some time getting used to. In best Dark Souls fashion: Prepare to die. There is a quickstart guide which explains you the basic controls and interaction capabilities, but no real dedicated tutorial. You will feel wonky at first, not really knowing whats going on... similar to learning how to swordfight in real life. Delving deeper into the game´s combat takes some time and learning. But once you get the basics of attacking, blocking and timing down, you will experiment with ripostes, feints and low blows untill every battle is a frantic dance of action!\nYes, the game is hard and the learning curve steep, but once you get a hang of it it will be infinitely satisfying. Experiment with weapons, techniques and fighting styles to overcome the challenge! The skill ceiling is basically infinite.\n\n\n\nPros:\n\n+ very atmospheric dungeon exploration\n+ a game world that feels real and interesting\n+ physical interactivity of nearly every object\n+ rewarding (player)skill and item progression\n+ extremely nuanced melee fighting system with endless possibilities\n+ every fight exciting and frantic\n+ enemies which differ by behavior and weapon skill, not hitpoint or damage values\n+ seperate arena mode for the ultimate combat experience\n+ detailed character creation\n+ superb graphic and sound design (especially lighting)\n+ extremely well polished for an early access title\n+ already hours of content to explore plus hidden secrets and a degree of randomization\n\n+ really dedicated developers who are into this game with their heart´s blood\n\n\nThings to come, but not yet implemented (and thus not part of my review):\n\n• Per session and global character skill progression\n• Large non-linear main game following early content\n• Build and permanently save characters by completing early content\n• New encounters, items and environments\n• Ranged combat and new close quarter manoeuvres\n• Numerous moddable thaumaturgic powers\n• More complete arena game modes featuring outdoor arenas\n• Complex NPC interactions and dialogue\n• Cooperative and competitive LAN multiplayer\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n- steep learning curve / lack of dedicated tutorial\n\n\nThat is really the only one. Once you adjusted to this unique system and dive into the nuances, you are in for one incredible round of dungeon exploration and frantic, deep and highly nuanced melee combat on which you can easily spend dozens or hundreds of hours.

The controls are unique compared to other games so it takes a while to get used to, most games uses static animations, in this game animations are simlulated muscle movements and can be altered realisticly from external forces making movements really dynamic.\nThe combat like many other things in the game is physics based, timing and precision is needed to be good and features accurate hitboxes, all objects are physically formed as they looks like, this makes how armors and weapons are shaped quickly more important than their "stats" (stats shown in a objects description isnt the actual stats, but just something so you can compare it to other items).\nIn arena mode there are 16 enemies with different level of skills and gear that you fight 1v1, the ai have same controls as you do so they arent cheating in any way, they got no intention of dying to you and with the dynamic nature of the game fights feels personal.\nEven if most enemies in adventure mode got nowhere close to the fighting skills that the npc's got in the arena and sucks at blocking attack you would think the adventure mode should be fairly easy, but theres where you are wrong. fighting in a small environment with alot of items/furniture laying around and possibly with multiple enemies is not always a simple task. Running away or avoid fighting all together is just as valid as defeating your opponent (if not more if you want to stay alive). This is a rpg with real consequences that cant be undone and death being the ultimate consequence. role playing will be more variated when more npc interactions, the dialogue system and skill system is implemented (and multiplayer).\nalot more can be said about the game, but what it boils down to is: its not meant for everyone, its hard/challenging and requires quite a bit of training to be any good. might not be much in terms of content yet, but with the dynamic nature of the game and all the areas to search you can end up using quite alot of time just on one playthrough.","April 29, 2015","true","132.7"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","18","26","2","0"

It is difficult, but also very engaging.  The music, the lighting, the way the camera works, and especially the combat, keep your eyes peeled.  You are constantly trying to see or listen for your next potential opponet, because you know that if you engage them in the wrong area you are sure to lose.\n\nI think my favorite aspect of this game is that each enemy presents a challenge.  Even a poorly equiped zombie with a crutch (yes a crutch) for a weapon can kick your a#@ if they take you by suprise.  Even after you have geared up, if you pick too many fights you put yourself at great risk.\n\nThis game take a while to figure out, but playing the arena is immensely helpful.  You will learn the basics of combat, and simply how to control your charecter, as it is quite unique.  Once you have figured out how to fight, the expert arena allows you to refine those skills and try out some of they higher end gear.  **Spoiler** the later enemies in the arena are full plate and ready to smash you in a few blows.\n\nI actually managed to reach the end, but it took me about 20 runs.  I call them runs because the game functions essentially like a rouge-like.  If you die you're done.  You can quit/save at any time, but that save is scrubed when you start again and should you die you start back at square one.  Each playthrough is somewhat unique in the gear that you will find, but many useful items are consitently there.  Also, the layout of the map is the same, but there are many places to explore, and you are constantly faced with the decision to push deeper into the dark (where the best items are) or stick to the places that are well lit, and safer for combat.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game, and I hope to see it prosper.  It is innovative, exciting, and frankly exactly what I have been wanting for a long time.\n\nThank you for making this game, and please continue to develop this gem.  I am anxiously awaiting more content.\n\nGood luck to everyone who decided to try this game out, and if it feels akward at first, give it a few hours, and it will quickly become addictive.\n\n-EPY\n","May 5, 2015","true","29.6"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","1"

That being said, this game is beyond amazing. I have very limited free time to enjoy games these days, not nearly like when I was younger. What I spend my free time playing is crucial so my time is not wasted. I don't play many games and Dark Souls series has been my exclusive game of choice for over 3 years now. This game has over taken that, and its not even a full game yet! The combat system is like nothing else I have ever experienced. It connects the player with the game on a deep level. Every swing counts, every back step, strafe and feign. No matter how good you get at fighting, a naked guy with a candlestick can still kick your ♥♥♥ if your game isn't absolutely on par. That being said its a punishing game, progess is sometimes slow (permadeath). it add yet another layer of depth and immersion and makes you really consider all options before proceeding. This is more than fine. This isn't a game that holds your hand and gives you some meaningless trophy for opening doors and stupid ♥♥♥♥ like so many games today that just basically hand you everything on a silver platter. you have to earn everything in this game. IT IS BYFAR THE MOST REWARDING GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. I encourage everyone to support Bare Mettle. They are changing the RPG genre as we know it. I can see a future where all fantasy and low fantasy RPGS are based in a physics world where everything is unscripted and the player must precisely aim their attacks. Not just spam the attack button. If you're on the fence about this game try it!!!! Be patient though. It takes time to get familiar with fighting, just like in real life. If you picked up and sword and starting fighting you're not going to be instantly good at it.

It takes a little time to get used to the combat controls and how to move around. But with a little practice in the Single-Player arena you get the hang of it.\n\nI didn't last long at all during my first few plays of the game, my first enemy encounters always ended up with me being on the wrong side of some enemies Axe all to quickly.\n\nThe graphics quality is fantastic, the animations seem to flow nicely and the physics making you watch where you are walking and what you walk into. Taking into account that this is not made a in publically available game engine such as Unity3D, Unreal Engine or CryEngine, makes this game even more impressive. A 3D graphics engine is by far one of the most hard and gruelling tasks a games developer can undertake. So, Kudos there guys.\n\nAlthough I do find the game lacking diverse content and things looking very similar from one room to the next - as is the norm for dungeon crawlers - I still rate this high on my list of games to play.

It is difficult to get used to the unique controls in this game because it is such a different concept compared to how these kinds of games usually approach the controls, but even though it is difficult it is entertaining the entire time you are getting familiar with it.  The character dynamics make each fight different, and there are occasionally hilarious and brutal moments that occur as a result of the physics.  This makes it exceptionally satisfiying when you land deadly strikes on an enemy or get knocked around yourself.\n\nThe visuals in the game are all pretty good.  I'm not too hard to please with art necessarily and don't run games at max settings, but this game runs well and looks good on my older computer.  The game has a very realistic looking art style and I love it so far.\n\nI'm most excited about the adventure campaign panning out, what I've seen so far looks absolutely fantastic but needs a lot more work to be something more fun and accessible to players who don't have a lot of skill.  It is especially brutal in that you only get one life and the enemies are extremely difficult.  As a fan of dungeon games, this game has massive potential to become something truly memorable so I hope the devs continue to work on this.\n\nI'm defenitely looking forward to getting the other game that is being developed in tandem with this one now, if it utilizes the same dynamic fighting system and has visuals as good as this game it will probably be awesome.\n\nSince it is early access, here is my super optimistic dev wishlist for things to implement..\n\n- Unarmed enemies who are easier that have only slash or bite attacks.\n- Randomized dungeons/levels.\n- Randomized quests/stories.\n- Randomized treasure loots.\n- Randomized scrolls that give permanent advanced magics.\n- Randomized hidden passages in dungeons.\n- Offensive/defensive basic magics.\n- Variety of fatal traps you can place.\n- Dismemberment option.\n- Removable underwears!! ;)\n- Being able to eat, sleep, poop, and pee.\n- Crazier hairstyles.\n- Saving/Loading.","May 4, 2015","true","15.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

A game, which demands you use your brain, instead of rock paper scisor technique... or textbook ''This is gonna make you win press button'' gameplay. You will die, you will rage and call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t... and you will always come back!\n\nFirst of all, the obvious.\n\nCombat: If you ever played and love the old classic, Die By The Sword, you remember the feel of landing a clean strike on an enemy's head. Aiming your blow, timing your moves, preparing your strike. And the feel, the impact, you knew you made this hit, not some simple ''press Left Click to strike face'' mechanic.\n\nExanima, has the same feel, but with more simple controls, beautiful graphics and an amazing physics engine. Each blunt strike has you feel the impact of your shot. Each bladed strike has you feel the slice of the swing, even if you simply hit with the tip of your blade. You feel the damage you do, instead of just having a boring hit marker or some health bar go down a little. Each weapon has it's own weight and feel. Each swing feels different based on momentum and movement. With a little practice, it gets easier to use your characters weight to control the swing and give it more power and makes combat even more satisfying.\n\nAnd the best part about combat in my opinion, is you can never predict the outcome of a fight, like in real life. But you can still prepare depending on what your opponent is wearing. A naked Undead with a club? Use a two handed blade to get an advantage. Skeleton with a sword and shield? use a heavy blunt weapon to counter his blocks. Even then, you might get hit a couple of times, even die... but the feel when you defeat a hard enemy... rarely felt in modern gaming!\n\nMovement: Moving around in and out of combat can feel a little weird at first, but when you get the hang of it, it all goes perfectly together. Kind of plays like a classic dungeon crawler, but with more physical restrictions. Your character builds momentum, his limbs are physically part of the world and everything you see in the world, can be used by you, or against you. For example, if you walk in a room full of chairs, you are bound to trip on them some time. Solution? Use your brain, like in real life, don't walk in chairs. Like real life, if your leg goes up and fall down in a chair hole, you will get your leg stuck, basic physics. This game, emulates these physics perfectly, requires you to think before running face first in a room full of... evil furniture. Sure, sometimes you will have some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments, like in every other games, but most of the time it is going to be because of you!\n\nSword is hitting walls when you fight? Use a shorter sword, don't fight close to a wall, swing from a side opposite to the wall\n\nInformation you know, and must use. That's the key to enjoying Exanima!\nIf you know chairs are a dangerous tripping factor, avoid fighting close to them. if you know, your sword is too long to fight in a doorway, avoid fighting in a doorway.\n\nKind of like MOBA players who whine because their cooldown time is 3 seconds. They know it will take 3 seconds to cooldown, but they whine because it took too long and they died\n\nIn the end, i enjoy the game a lot. It has it's moments, sure, like everything else in the world. But when you actually make your way further than your last play, it feels good! Beating a previously tough enemy in the arena, feels good. Finding sweet loot that helps you in hard situations, feels good!","April 30, 2015","true","12.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

Exanima is basically the same game, minus all the features they plan to have incorporated in SG. They may update Exanima to include some of these combat features, but even as it stands now, it's a very well made game. You can look up the Devs here for videoes of their progress http://www.baremettle.com/\n\nThe most important factor in this game is that it uses a physics based combat system. Picture something like Diablo, or  Baldur's gate, where it's dark and creepy and every aspect of combat is affected by numbers and stats. This sword does 1-10 damage, this armor has X ammount of defence or protection. It doesn't quite work the same in Exanima. Gear does have stats, somewhat, but they're more statistics of the physics that make that weapon function. Weight for example will be a large factor in how quickly you can swing your weapon. Slower in turn means that the weapon will likely have more force and impact when landing a hit. Whereas lighter weapons that are well balanced will allow you to attack quickly and stay on your feet easily while dealing less damage.\n\nThe health system, like the combat, is also very hardcore and realistic. Taking a sledgehammer to the head may outright kill you, and if not, your maximum health will likely be reduced permanently from how serious the wound was. Similarly, being cut by a knife or sword while wearing simple normal clothes will cause serious damage even if it wasn't a powerful hit, but attacking someone in full platemail with a tiny dagger will likely do almost nothing. The other exception is that armor only provides protection to the part of the body its covering. So that same platemail wearing person, without a helmet on of any kind, could still be hit in the head/face for serious damage.\n\nThe music is dark and gloomy. Would have liked to see a change in tempo/theme when in battle. Sounds are excelent and everything sounds like it should. Slashing at someone wearing chainmail sounds like you're hitting chainmail as opposed to skin. Kicking a box or barrel accidently, makes a noise. Running with a torch causes a flame ruffling sound. Enemies seem to react to noises as well, though I've not seen too much of this yet from my currently limited playtime.\nGameplay is fun, creepy, stressful and everything inbetween. There's no save function beyond exiting to continue playing where you left off later on. As a result I died at least 20 times before making any real progress and decided to practice combat in the arena mode, which I would suggest to any new player for sure to get the feel for the controls.\n\nIf you're interested in a game that makes you feel powerless, like you would be if you were armed with nothing more than a stick. If you want a game that doesn't have over the top explosions and fancy screen filling graphic soup, but instead realistic sword clashing combat. If you want to actually have to practice fighting, not to leveling up a stat, but to actually feel like you yourself are training to be a better warrior, this game will still kick your ♥♥♥ and make you feel like any mistake you make is your life forefit.\n\n*Edit* After clearing both arena difficulties several times, and finding weapons and combat styles I prefer using, I can only say that I'm that much more in love with it now and anticipating SG's release even more. Also, as noted by every negative review in this game, the controls are simplistic, but very hard to master (Try changing your movement mode from hold to double tap if you dont like that style). Why anyone would be looking for yet another boring, cookie cutter dungeon crawler, I have no idea.","April 30, 2015","true","66.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

The animations cannot switch instantly like traditional games.  Characters have to use their muscles to swing, stop their swing, then swing in the opposite direction.  You try doing that with a 10kg weight.\n\nThe combat will probably be fleshed out more and right now is simple but still totally fair and you can still pwn it to a pretty great degree.  I would advice going straight into arena mode for ages before the main game.  People have to get use to a new system rather then adapting current combat systems.\n\nThis is one of those games achieves a gaming element that hasn't been done before, you'll see for yourself after you test your might against it's combat system.\n\nThis is just a pre-game to the even more ambitious open world they are trying to create.

Once you get the hang of it you will love the combat system as it always ends up being something that you personally (and not any character) must be proficient at and *maintain* proficiency. It adds a wonderful degree of positive stress to perform well in each match lest you let your character (and progress) die quickly and without much ado. Be sure to plan on getting up from the computer and doing something else a few times while you manage frustration during the learning process. Give it a few hours of learning and maybe a few YT vids. :-) Also, try the arena (in pugilism!!!).

The game feels quite fluid, the atmosphere is great, and the armor and weapon design is excellent. If you want to just do combat, the arena mode is great. That said, if you want an RPG experience, wait for Sui Generis, the real version of this game to come out. While the game is fun in arena mode, the actual dungeon crawling is nothing but a pain and a massive waste of time. One small slip up can get you killed, coupled with no saving, you're forced to started completely from scratch. If this were a rogue like with a procedurally generated dungeon each time, I'd find this more acceptable, however, without it, it's nothing but constantly doing the same thing over and over again only to make one mistake and die and then do it over and over again, which leaves the player frustrated and without a will to play. In it's current state I cannot recommend this for an rpg experience which I was expecting.

It's a very fun dungeon crawler with a complex physics-based combat system.\n\nThere are two game 'modes' so far: the story campaign and the combat arenas. In the campaign you're dropped into an underground area and need to fight or evade some zombie-like enemies (and some others...) to find your way out, and find out what's happened to everyone who used to live down there. The story is revealed mostly in books and scrolls, so you can choose whether you want to read them or not. Environmental storytelling also plays a big part; the maps feel like 'real' places, with workshops, mess halls, sleeping chambers, medical areas, armouries, even a winery. The atmosphere is tense, and aided by a great soundtrack.\n\nThe arena mode is where you can engage in pure combat against a variety of foes, and this is where most of the replayability is. The combat takes a while to get used to, but that's to be expected since this is really unlike anything else out there.\n\nThe combat moves are not simply pre-set like you find in most games, but rely on the physics simulation, so you throw more weight into your swings by timing your moves with your character's momentum. The simulation is very precise, so if you hit your enemy on a part of their body that's not covered by armour, you'll do more damage. Same goes for you, so you need to keep an eye out for armour with good coverage -- especially important in the campaign mode where healing options are few and far between.\n\nDifferent types of weapons are suited to different situations too, so if your opponent is wearing heavy plate it's best to use a heavy crushing weapon like a maul or mace, while bladed weapons are better suited to fighting lightly armoured enemies.\n\nThe best part is, it's all based on the physics simulation, so it all makes logical sense. A heavy crushing weapon will hit like a truck and can even knock enemies to the ground where you can finish them off. You can even get tangled up with your opponent and swing them off their feet -- or they can do it to you. The result is a combat system where no two fights are the same.\n\nOverall, highly recommended, but remember that it is a hard game, and it does take a while to learn how everything works, so don't be discouraged when you first play it and get destroyed by the first enemy. Once you learn the controls, they work very well and with practice and patience you'll start dominating. The list of upcoming features sounds great so I'm looking forward to updates.","May 1, 2015","true","37.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

You'll feel pretty crappy about the game, get angry at the controls, upset when the enemies ignore your guard or neatly slice you open.  Just keep at it, when you get your first hit/combo/attack that you wish you'd recorded you'll be hooked.  Then it starts to become intuitive, you learn to handle the character, to flow with momentum, feint, judge range, control your movement rather than letting your weapon control you.  This is where the game REALLY blossoms, the tactical importance of a step forward or a step back, judging your opponent, finding ways inside their guard and directing the cutting edge of your strike for the weakest armor (often enough it's the face).\n\nIt's still in early access, but based on what I've seen things can only get better.  I love coming home and dumping an hour or two into hacking away at the NPCs.  For anyone interested in this game, I'd highly suggest you also look at their website for their open world game Sui Generis (still in production as of this writing).","May 23, 2015","true","51.0"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

I see others stating what games this is similiar to but when it comes down to it, there is nothing like what Bare Mettle has come up with. I get caught up just playing around with the physics. Yes the controls are awkward, and yes hard core gamers have a hard time with them. Why? because they have it ingrained into their head how things should be controlled on a screen. It has become apparent that those that have no preconcieved notions about how to control a character take to these controls a lot smoother. I could keep going on and on about the game, but bottom line is, it's a great game, it's only going to get better and it's cheap. How much do you make an hour? This game is 15 bucks, does this game justify 15 bucks?

Very satisfying, skillful, and fun. And this is coming from someone with several hundred hours in Mount and Blade.\n++ Beautiful graphics/visuals. Dynamic lighting is spot-on.\n++ Lots of content.

Seriously, this game NEEDS a map. These levels are huge and maze-like. I get you're trying to create a difficult, confusing experience. But it just feels frustrating, and doesn't make sense from a narrative nor mechanical perspective. You have a journal; there's no reason you can't draw a map.\n\n-- Replayability somewhat lacking. The only randomly generated elements of this game are the items in chests. Everything else is static. This detracts from replayability.\n\n-- Unsophisticated puzzles. This game describes itself as something of a puzzle-solver, when really the puzzles are no more than exploiting game mechanics or doing speed-runs.\n\n-- AI is dull. All of the enemies have just about the same fighting style (wildly swing and walk towards you).  This can, at times, make one of the most creative combat systems I've ever seen very dull. EDIT: After playing for a while longer, I've encountered new enemies with new and vastly different fighting styles.\n\nIN CONCLUSION:\n\nThis game has more potential than I've ever seen from an early access title.

Bare Mettle really haven't done anything another developer has done before in RPG, except they have created a physics engine that is truly sublime; especially for an independent label. You truly feel your reactions are the cause of your demise or success, and as much as you curse the sod that killed you, you equally curse yourself for your presumption. Not just your own physics, but the AI too seems as balanced as a Bolshoi ballerina. It's reactions too can often embarrass the human's at times, and I'm not even on level 3.\n\nYou are paying for the physics here, and not much else. There's a fairly formulaic story, which is progressively interesting, but that's about it.

The graphics are great for a game such as this, the combat is a never done before style and it's the best thing since sliced bread, the lore right now is secretive and we don't know a great deal but what we do know and what we have read has been interesting as hell and i'm craving more as i write this!\n\nHonestly, if you play 1, 2 or even say 4 or 5 hours of this game and say the controls are clunky, the combat is drunken silliness then please just play it more, it took me a couple of days when i first started playing this game in march last year but i've never been happier once i got used to it and started kicking ♥♥♥!\n\nI can't say much more really, Murf made a great comment in his review, what is £10.99 for a life long purchase. You're paying 1/4 the price of your average triple A title and you're getting more from it as lets be honest, most triple A games are a pile of horse ♥♥♥♥. So just do yourself a favour and buy this game.","May 7, 2015","true","32.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

The engine gives the user a refreshing control system that is easy to learn but hard to master. You wake up in a medieval prison of some sort, with just a letter in your pocket and a torch on the ground next to you, the rest is up to you to find out. Alternatively, you can play in arena mode which puts you in a one on one combat situation with 2 difficulty settings.\nIn combat your character is subject to balance, physical limitations and momentum. For instance, swinging a huge sledgehammer will send your character off balance and running into the same direction and it is up to you to correct it to steady yourself. This isn't particularly recommended as you'll most probably end up staggering around like a guy who's had too many flagons of mead. If it's not the mead that makes you fall to the floor it'll be your opponents weapon colliding with your face. If you've ever swung a heavy object you'll know exactly how it feels and best of all, the movements in the game are believable. You really get a feel of how your character moves and how to adapt to the weapon you're using. The combat makes for a challenging yet rewarding experience that can lead to a very intense, addictive experience.\n*Insert picture of title page*\nGRAPHICS:\n\nIn short, the graphics are excellent. The gloomy visuals really put you in place of a medieval dungeon. The lighting effects are exceptional, the shadows provided by the torch and other scarce light sources are very good and realistic. If you stand next to a crate all the individual gaps inside it shine the light through the object and at a wall. I spent a considerable amount of time in the starting room just admiring the graphics, as well as chuckling at the potential of derpy legs and comical trips, which I will cover a bit later. Also, my girlfriend took a short look and compared the game to an “Indiana Jones Gladiator” aesthetic which actually isn't too bad of an analogy on a first look, which also gave me a giggle.\n\nAUDIO:\n\nExanimas ambient audio really fits in well with the game setting, the music is gloomy and spooky, easily being reusable in a horror game. The footsteps echo nicely and the weapon noises are realistic and well created. Both the graphics and audio give the game an impressive first look.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nSo now to the gameplay, with most of this section will be dedicated to the games physics system.\nIf you don't want to go through all the technical aspects, the TL:DR section provides a nice, humorous story of one of the situations I caught myself in game.\nControls are quite minimal but complex in the way they can be used. Generally WASD can be used to move in an old style resident evil type of way out of combat, with A and D rotating your character whilst moving forward or back with W and S. You can alternatively hold the RMB which will make your character follow the cursor. I opens your inventory  where you drag and drop items from either the environment or from a dead body onto your character or into your inventory (which is seemly unlimited I might add … where in his underwear is he hiding all those axes?!). There is possibility for a situation I call “derpy legs syndrome”, where the character can easily trip over objects or gets his feet stuck into the environment. Whilst being a little annoying in the middle of combat it's actually quite amusing when it does happens.\nTAB puts your character into his/her combat stance, when you do this, WASD changes to now react relative to the direction of the cursor. As of this, your body rotates to the direction of your cursor, which is actually a very important part of the controls and can help or hinder your character's balance. A and D will make your character strafe whereas W and S will move your character forward and backward.\nHolding LMB will cause your character to swing his weapon, the direction and force depends completely on how you control the character. The damage you cause is dependant of:  the speed of the strike, where the strike hits the enemy, the area of your weapon that hits, your character's balance and the stats of the chosen weapon. When you're not attacking, your character attempts to defend automatically. It's helped by your character's posture and the direction you're facing, which adds another element into how you position and control your character. Or you can just run head on into your opponents body and hope for the best (which is actually a decent tactic against weapons with a sharp or blunt edge on a pole). In a matter of speaking, the game puts all the pressure on YOU. The game is very skill based and only you can mess it up for yourself.\nThere are an infinite amount of tactics you can apply as you play like for instance counter striking your opponent as he starts a huge swing towards you. Beware though, the only place swinging like a madman trying to dismember your opponent will get you is face down on the floor. The AI is in no way dumb, especially in the arena mode. Your opponent also tries to look for your mistakes and weak spots and will capitalise when you're off balance.\nWeapons have 2 main stats, and a large amount of others which chow what type of damage they cause (slash, crush, pierce etc)\nWeight: Self explanatory, the heavier the weapon the harder it is to swing. They also have the potential for the highest damage however they are harder to use.\nBalance: Balance dictates how balanced the weight is. For instance, a small sword is well balanced and controlled easily whereas a top heavy sledgehammer can send you flying and staggering around like a lunatic if you don't stay in control.\nPro tip: As much as I have tried to figure out, the physique of your character doesn't effect your strength of ability to handle heavy weaponry, as of this creating a skinny character leaves less for your opponent to hit, making you a harder target.\n\nTL:DR\n\nSo after getting used to the controls I hop into the arena. I get to a fight between a somewhat rotund guy with mace and shield. With my superior intellect I end up whittling his health down by taking advantage of his wild swings sending him off balance constantly. As the fight was folding to a conclusion, I wind up a huge swing with my trusty two-handed sword. My opponent barely blocks it with his shield, staggering him and spinning him around exposing his back to me. This was it, I prepare to end my domination with a huge finishing blow but just as I start my swing I see my opponent flailing back towards me. I release LMB to bring my sword back to defend but it was too late. What I inevitably ended up doing was helping my opponent pull off a 360 bludgeoning that was reminiscent of how kids spin around in circles as fast as they can pretending to be a tornado. Next thing I know my character's body fell to the floor like a sack of potatoes whilst sporting a large, mace shaped crater in his cranium.\nThe thing is though, I wasn't even frustrated! I winced, chuckled, shook my head and pounced right back into the action to exact my revenge. The unpredictability that the physics and AI can provide, leads to amazingly tense combat, potential for hilarious scenarios and challenging gameplay.\n\n\nOVERALL THOUGHTS AND CONCLUSIONS:\n\nThe combat system is very well thought out and surprisingly realistic.\nExanima has a very refreshing take on the RPG genre, giving the player a unique and connective experience with the character and the combat system. It's enjoyable and addictive and the unique and unpredictable combat means I will be coming back for more for a long time to come.","May 21, 2015","true","15.1"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

My primary gripe with Exanima (beside a lack of content as of my writing this), is that the physics engine that the devs are so proud of is honestly just unrealistic and frustrating.\n\nThere's no reason for my peasant-fighter character , in nothing but a cloth shirt and pants, to be wobbling around and tripping over his own feet. As many other posters have said, 90% of people after a heavy night of drinking could fight and swing a weapon better than the characters in this game.\n\nThe game itself is an interesting concept, runs well on my PC, and has a really gripping art style and atmosphere. However, the "drunk" combat just kills it for me; the experience is neither fun nor rewarding enough to warrant playing the game for any prolonged period, nevermind paying to do so. Many other combat games do a much better job of allowing players to show (and be rewarded for) their skill without forcing them to spend dozens of hours acclimatizing themselves to a nonsensical and downright silly combat system.\n\nWorse, perhaps, is that it's quite clear while reading through the reviews and the forums that both the developers and the crowd of diehard fanboys (numbering in the dozens) refuse to accept any critique of their game positively. I'm sure it's showing in their bottom line, but it's unfortunate given the potential this game had to actually be FUN (unimportant, I know).\n\nIf you want fun melee combat just pick up Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, or the classic Mount & Blade series. Both offer hundreds more hours of fun combat than this game ever will with the current production team behind it.\n\nTLDR; Imagine if they added combat to QWOP and charged you £11 for it.","January 31","false","1.2"," 26 of 45 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","26","45","0","2"

Let me just put that out there. It;s great. I love the combat. I haven't delved much into the whole dungeony part, and have spent most of my time in the practice arena's and the rest into the regular arena mode. The three main problems I have are:\n-Camera is the WORST THING. Like holy crap, the camera is annoying.\n-Second, The arena mode fighters take WAAAAAY too long to skill up. Like, in order to get to the point where you have swords and metal parts in your armor, that character will have had to have HUNDREDS of battles. And that part is when it gets the most fun! That's why i like the practice arena. It ramps up quick.\n-Lastly, The dugeon is slow. It takes a WHILE to find useful gear od even enemies. And there's no map, so you have to try to remember where all the locked doors and unexplored areas are. I undersrtand if that's how the game is meant to be played, but I want a map you can pull out to at least help a little.\nNevertheless, The combat is really, REALLY fun. I've always loved physicsy games, so This was amazing. Just ramp up the speed of the dungeon and arena mode, because I don't always have the time to slog out so many hours to make so little progress.","May 23","true","53.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","4"

So, without further delay:\nDrunk Sledgehammer Fight Simulator 2016\nand\nOnly fantasy game to actually include toilets, 10/10\n\nWith that done, I feel that any honest suggestion of this game has to at least mention the fact that this game exists as a testing ground for the mechanics the devs intend to use in their larger (and far more ambitious) game, Sui Generis. As such, the phrase "Glorified Tech Demo" is not completely inapt. However, this does not mean that this is not a full game (in progress), but just that the scope of the game is limited in part by its position in the overall plans of the devs.\n\nExanima is at its core a dungeon crawl, and it does that completely adequately. The dungeon is large and maze-like. There are keys that open doors. There are enemies, treasure chests, and puzzles. If it sounds like I am unenthusiastic about this game, that would be incorrect. However, this aspect of the game, the “Shell” of the game so to say, is not what makes the game interesting. All of these things are good enough; At worst, underwhelming, and at best, average. However, there are two things that make this game stand out: the atmosphere and the combat.\n\nThe world of Exanima and Sui Generis is a low and dark fantasy setting. This world is incredibly well communicated through the environment, items, and enemies. Magical equipment exists, but is rare, and most of the time, upgrades are simply higher quality or built differently than their predecessors. Most items look suitably worn, and the environment is dark, foreboding, and filled with hints of activity before its abandonment. Scrolls are sprinkled throughout the dungeon, giving hints of these activities. The lighting is excellent, casting deep shadows through the dungeon, making each corner dark and mysterious. Overall, the atmosphere is sufficiently dark, grim, and makes for an excellent world to explore.\n\nThe second, and largest part of what makes Exanima worth playing, is its combat. Instead of simply pressing a button to make an attack with a pre-canned animation that if it connects does a constant amount of damage (ignoring target armor/stats), each attacks damage in Exanima is based on physics. Defence is handled automatically, with characters attempting blocks and parries at any attacks coming at them from the front. Attacking is more complex, relying on positioning, timing, and accurate movements. While swinging a weapon, movements of both your and enemy characters can affect how the weapon strikes an enemy. Stepping into a stab increases its damage, stepping back lowers it. A polearm swing at to close a target that strikes the enemy with the pole does far less damage than a proper strike with the head. This, combined with a remarkably detailed armor system, makes combat very realistic-ish. At its core, the basic moves of real combat are there. Stepping into lunges, rotating with your hips into a swing to increase its power, maintaining effective range, all there. However, it is much slower and often looks clumsier than real combat, hence the drunk sledgehammer fight joke. I remain unconvinced that this system is necessarily better than a traditional animation based system. As I said, it leads to clumsy looking fights. It is by necessity slower than a traditional system. Slightly wonky physics can lead to odd clipping errors, such as getting an arm twisted and stuck behind the players back. Despite all this, I can confidently say that it is the most interesting combat system I have played. Because the damage is physics based, big hits feel satisfying. A hit from a sledgehammer can knock an opponent into a ragdoll. Stepping into a stab produces excellent looking stabs with real impact. Despite the many oddities that the system brings, overall, the combat is, while not flashy, interesting, impactful, and most importantly, fun. It’s a very unique system that makes this game interesting enough to be worth checking out.","May 26","true","14.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You don't know where you are and what you have to do, the dungeon is dark and you have no mini-map. While exploring the dungeon you face many enemies who respond to your presence differently, as they can attack you on sight or they don't attack you at all if you are not in aggresive stance. Every fight you have in this game is different and unlike other games you will have to play more careful because critical damage done to your character will not heal. This means you will have to be aware of your surroundings and wether there are objects around you which might make you trip during a fight.\n\nThe way armour works in this game is fantastic, your character is very fragile and having your whole body covered in platearmour will not suddenly make you very powerful and unbeatable, you will still have to think and play very careful for you can still die at this point too.\n\nThe game has a lot of secrets and puzzles which can be solved by using objects in your surrounding, it gives the player freedom to figure out how to solve puzzles with more than just one way to do it.\n\nThis game is not for everyone, if you are looking for an exciting and challenging RPG game then you won't regret this purchase.","May 28","true","202.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I've played this game a decent bit and I haven't even gotten past the first chunk of dungeon in the story mode. It boasts a story and an arena mode. I'd say arena is more fun for those with poor path finding skills, but if you have good path finding and memory then transverse the perilous dungeon for fifteen dollars.

Fighting someone with a chair leg is very different from using a machete. Add to this the range of weapons both you and the opponents can use combined with where you fight them, a corridor, around a table and no two fights are ever the same.\n\nA few people have been complaining about the permadeath but its worth noting that as you progress you get better Armour which means when you fight you don't loose any permanent health, just stamina which is regenerated after the fight, so essentially it does become easier than when you first wake up wearing rags and have no equipment.\n\nThere is health potions that do heal anyway but they are considering adding 'checkpoints' to the early content to save your progress. There is also a skill system on its way so you will be able to earn permanent skill points for starting builds on new characters.\n\nIt's worth noting that not all enemy's will attack on sight, which is handy if you want to hide out the way till they go past and have an explore about.\n","May 6, 2015","true","22.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

This is because you will spend a good amount of time learning the mechanics, and even then, if the enemy gets a lucky hit, it could all be over for you. Exanima will make your heart pound as you navigate the dungeons, unsure which NPCs intend on attacking you, and which just want to be left alone to wander the halls.\n\nThe physics engine is so refreshing. While unlikely if you're walking, if you're moving too fast you can easily trip over objects laying on the floor, or just trip, and take an enemy down with you, both stumbling up to try to bash the other's brains out. The only negative I've noticed is that, while strafing in combat, both you and the enemy sometimes cross your feet, which any HEMA enthusiast can tell you is a no-no in melee combat.\n\nIf you're iffy on this game, I would suggest going ahead and putting your money in to it. The learning curve is quite steep, taking quite a bit of time to master, but the basics only take a few minutes to learn.","September 23, 2015","true","18.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Combat feels like it has oomph, but in a way that feels realistic as opposed to overly slow (i.e. it seems the developers realize that swords don't weigh 10 pounds, but at the same time they also seem to know that medieval combat is visceral).\n\nDefinitely recommend this game, even on the basis that I've only played in the Arena so far.

To the uninitiated, it controls rather awkwardly, with everyone essentially being a ragdoll animated by physics.  Once you get into the swing of things, however, you tend to find that this is about as skill-based as an action melee game can get.  Hits and misses are entirely physics-based.  You have to work with your movements, build up momentum properly, time everything just right, down to a shuffling of the feet or a swing of your weapon.  You can win any fight as long as you know what you're doing.\n\nIt's all based around realism while still being balanced.  Blades don't require as much force and have a greater contact area for doing damage generally, while blunt instruments are the opposite.  Armor will protect better against blades, reducing it to less-lethal blunt damage, while maces and morningstars will bully your tin can until you're nothing but tomato soup inside.\n\nOnce you get good at it, nothing can really compare to smashing someone's stupid face in with a mallet, or even a cleaver.  It's all very satisfying, as many others would testify.\n\nThe arena mode sates my need for progression, and I look forward to seeing how the game develops.\n\n--\n\nThe only real gripes I have are mostly things that will be ironed out through development, like pugilism being a bit broken in that there's way too many one-inch-punches, and you cannot seem to block with your fists at this time.\n\nOh yeah, and that short characters are quite disadvantaged for obvious reasons.","January 17","true","19.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

Finally a game where combat has evolved into something tactical and more involving. The use of physics here is the best i've seen so far in a fantasy game.\n\nActually the Arena mode is really fun in it's own. There's a bit of a learning curve to combat, but it didn't take me more than maybe 5 minutes to get fairly good at it, totally worth it. One thing i learned was to really pay attention to the enemy's movement (more than my own).. You shouldnt really look at your character at all in combat, instead just pay attention to the red crosshair and where your hits will approx. land and when. Yes, that might sound totally obvious, but it probably isnt since we're not really used to this type of combat in games - we usually just click away and eventually we win, this doesnt work here (which is great).\n\nThe graphics is great, both textures and lightning. The environements i've seen so far are a bit dull though.\n\nThere's a great feeling of accomplishment when you win over the more difficult enemies - this is missing in most fantasy RPG's.\n\nHighly recommended.","May 6, 2015","true","0.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Far below you, as you teeter on the airy brink of a screaming descent, you are just barely able to make out a teeming, seething mass of color and light; tantalizing, gleaming with a banal allure, its glittering generality draws you in, calling to you with a melancholic siren's song, tempting you to take the step and plunge willingly into its garish embrace.\n\nHowever, your lofty vantage point, and the laborious climb you undertook to ascend to this megalithic perch reminds you of why you are here; and like a lungful of biting cold mountain air, you see with painful clarity the hollow emptiness of the false promises of those plaintive voices, which to the weak and cowardly sound like the lyre and flute of a lonely goddess.\n\nThat is Exanima. That is the difficulty and reward for mastering a game which I can only describe as revolutionary, ambitious, and truly different from all the other RPG's, triple-A titles, formulaic franchises, and other money-making schemes of the big publishers and their ilk.\n\nMany of you are skeptical of Steam Early Access games, and for good reason. Oftentimes investing in an unfinished product leaves that product in a perpetual cycle of development, where the developers lose their incentive for fixing anything or adding meaningful content as they rake in more and more money from people like you, the people who give their money and time in the hopes that the creators will actually use your "support" towards the common (and advertised) goal. Why would you financially support their endeavor otherwise?\n\nThese developers care. They care about making something which is not only totally different in the way the core gameplay operates, but is also helped along and advised by the players and community. They have made a game where every action, every duel, every combat and subtle move made and choice in positioning has weight (pun intended) and impact (pun intended there too) in your playthrough. Every object, every part of your character, your equipment, your weapons and armor, have a physical presence in the game world which no other game has ever come close to realizing. Yes, there is indeed a steep learning curve, but the reward for your time and patience in mastering the technique is truly satisfying, as is the knowledge that the money you paid for this game goes not only to further Exanima support and development, but also towards Bare Mettle's magnum opus Sui Generis.\n\nIf you have been searching for something different, something difficult, something rewarding and worth your time, you've found it. I don't write reviews much, but Exanima and Bare Mettle Entertainment have earned my praise a hundredfold. Please support this game and these developers, it's worth every penny.\n\nGood luck.

But there was no reason to, this game is briliant, bloody, BRILIANT! I absolutly love it.\n\nI started up the campaign, and it lead to a character creation page. While the custoization is pretty great for a game like this, I would have liked to see a little more. Then I began the game, and immidiatly died at the first hit. So, I started the arena to get a feel for the controls. And even though the dungeon crawling is one of the main selling points, the arena mode itself is enough to justify the $15 price-tag. Each enemy in the arena behaves differently, and most importantly they act human. They stumble, they miss, they misjudge distance. I don't know how much money the AI programer makes but give him a raise. after dying in the arena, you restart with all the equipment that was on your character. It feels great to get that one step further in the arena because of it. That being said, it would be appreciated if that were also in the campaign.\n\nI love this game, and it's more than worth your money, but unless we critisize, the game can't progress. So here's a list of things that I would like to see in future updates.\n\n\n- A tutorial.; this game is hard, and I know that a tutorial might cheapen the experiance of learning manuvers, but it'd be nice.\n\n- more character customization; I just think it'd be nice.\n\n-gladiatorial multipayer: a 1v1 multiplayer mode would make this game a lot more fun. Though the AI arena is amazing, it would be cool if we could hone our skills and chalange other players\n\n-More weapon variety: maybe let us have a rapier, or maybe let us use two one handed swords, daggers, you know things like that.\n\n-more gore; it would add somwthing to the feel of the game if there was noticeable wounds and blood splatters on the characters and environment.\n\n- and open world adventure mode: I know that this is a bad thing to ask for and it would be very hard to make.

The only other game I have written one for was How To Survive, I believe. So that alone should show how much I feel for this game, but let's get right into it.\n\nPros:\n1. The combat system is incredible. While hard to master at first, you eventually get used to and come to love it. the fact moving your whole character and swinging your weapon both make a difference together is marvelous and the way your weapons can sometimes clash and get stuck for a moment, just like they would in reality, is fantastic.\n\n2. The character customization, yes, you can create your own character from scratch. Whether you're fat, thin, muscular or not. Your sex, height, age (physical), and hair style/colour is all interchangeable.\n\n3. The variety in weapons and armour, and even clothing is quite fantastic. (this coming from a person who, out of his two hours of play-time, has only played through the arena mode and just started the story.) From simple linen clothing to light leather armour and finishing with things like full-plate suits of classic medieval armour. And with the armour, come individual weapons and shields to come with them. From greatswords to axes and sickles to spears.\n\nCons:\n1. Perma-death. Let me start by telling you all that this game is -hard-, and I really mean that. The combat style, as I said, is difficult to master and sometimes a battle is won or loss by a matter of a single lucky swing makes it genuinely brain-numbing. This is a hardcore game, as it says, but we could atleast get a none-perma-death option, right? Maybe even just mid-game saves?\n\n2. As it stands, this game is still in early-access and has a long way to go. And not only that, this is merely a prequel, as stated. So there is not a huge amount to do other than follow through the story and spam the arena mode like I've done for a good while, admittedly fun, but it will get old fast.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you are willing to put up with the limited (I use that term very lightly) content outside of the story, then I say go ahead. If you want to support the development of this game, I say go ahead.\nIf you are expecting and hoping for a lot very quickly? Then maybe wait a month or so. Wait till there's a bit more for the game to offer you.","September 10, 2015","true","47.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Once I beat it I anticipate doing all sorts of varied runs and even speed runs, but thats once I beat it. How you adapt to this game is impressive. You start out in the Arena barely being able to take on the first couple fights. I remember getting to the third and asking myself if this was finally the boss. (it isn't) But after much practice you'll be able to clear it without taking mortal/red damage (the damage that doesnt heal).\n\nIt is hard adjusting to the camera controls and especially swinging left-right and parrying, but once you do it's incredibly rewarding. A lot of complaints are about no-saves and hate having to replay it over and over, but there are easy ways to not let this effect you, once youve cleared an area the first time, make a mental note of what is actually important, then once you die you can breeze through the area grab what you absolutely need and keep running to where you were last.

One that will only become more attractive once the devs add new major gameplay features like thaumaturgy, ranged combat, etc.\n\nThumbs up!\n\nAlso:\n\n\n█▀▀ㅤ █ ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ▀▀█▀▀ㅤㅤ█ㅤ █ㅤ █▀▀▄\n▀▀█ㅤ█▀▀█ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ ㅤ █ㅤㅤㅤ █ ㅤ █ㅤ █ ㅤ █\n▀▀▀ㅤ▀ ㅤ▀ㅤ ▀▀▀▀ㅤㅤ ▀ㅤㅤ ㅤ ▀▀▀▀ㅤ █▀▀\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ▄▀▀▄ㅤ█▀▀▄ㅤ █▀▀▄\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ█▄▄█ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ█ ㅤ █\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ█ㅤ █ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ█▄▄▀\n\n─────███────██\n──────████───███\n────────████──███\n─────────████─█████\n████████──█████████\n████████████████████\n████████████████████\n█████████████████████\n█████████████████████\n█████████████████████\n██─────██████████████\n███────────█████████\n█──█───────────████\n█──────────────██\n██──────────────█────────▄███████▄\n██───███▄▄──▄▄███──────▄██$█████$██▄\n██──█▀───▀███────█───▄██$█████████$██▄\n██──█───█──██───█─█──█$█████████████$█\n██──█──────██─────█──█████████████████\n██──██────██▀█───█─────██████████████\n─█───██████──▀████───────███████████\n──────────────────█───────█████████\n─────────────▀▀████──────███████████\n────────────────█▀──────██───████▀─▀█\n────────────────▀█──────█─────▀█▀───█\n──▄▄▄▄▄▄▄────────██────█───████▀───██\n─█████████████────▀█──█───███▀──▄▄██\n─█▀██▀██▀████▀█████▀──█───██████▀─▀█\n─█────────█▄─────────██───████▀───██\n─██▄████▄──██────────██───██──▄▄▄██\n──██▄▄▄▄▄██▀─────────██──█████▀───█\n─────────███────────███████▄────███\n────────███████─────█████████████\n───────▄██████████████████████\n████████─██████████████████\n─────────██████████████\n────────███████████\n───────█████\n──────████\n─────████\n\nㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ▀▀█▀▀ㅤ█▀▀█ㅤ█ㅤ▄█ㅤ█▀▀\nㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤ ㅤㅤ█ ㅤㅤ█▄▄█ㅤ█▀▀▄ ㅤ█▀▀\nㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ▀ㅤ ㅤ▀ㅤ ▀ㅤ▀ㅤㅤ▀ㅤ▀▀▀\n\n█▀▄▀█ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ ㅤ█▀▄▀█ ▄▀▀▄ █▀▀▄ █▀▀ █ ㅤ █ㅤ█\n█─▀─█ㅤ█▄▄█ㅤㅤ █─▀─█ █ ㅤ █ █ ㅤ █ █▀▀ █▄▄█ㅤ█\n█ㅤㅤ █ㅤ▄▄▄█ㅤ ㅤ█ㅤㅤ█ ─▀▀ ─ ▀ ㅤ ▀ ▀▀▀ ▄▄▄█ㅤ▄","May 3, 2015","true","12.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I was met with a large sprawling system of more ♥♥♥♥ing doors and plenty of corridors, Upon opening the second ever door i found, i was met with some clueless zombie barstard swinging an axe almost uncontrollably at me. After a quick look through the controls i figure out how to toggle into combat mode. My time had come... i entered combat, started swinging at the poor zombie fellow in an autistic fit of rage, only to find the wounds I created were innefective and the most i had really seem to do to this fellow was knock him on his ♥♥♥ with the use of the near-by boxes.\n\nHealth running low I hit the legs, and by that i ♥♥♥♥ing ran as fast as the poorly scant animations would take me... My health at this point was looking like the dislike bar of any number of justin beibers videos. I. Was. In. Touble. I ran and ran, finally finding an open door, this zombie ♥♥♥♥ still hot on my heels, i found a large metal bar, which in comparison to my simple small iron ♥♥♥♥♥ at the time, it was like seeing ♥♥♥♥ing excaliber dislocated from the rock, sitting right before me for my fat-♥♥♥ characters use. I quickly popped it in my hand, and once again entered combat mode. My health at this point was like you could barely see any yellow anymore... Anyway i took a few swings at him, the reach on this ♥♥♥♥ off bar was HUGE, i mean i was landing blows, he was starting to loose blood, i was feeling good. However after i swear i had almost downed him at this point his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ friend came stumbling through the door, saw me, and started full on sprinting at me to get a piece of that ♥♥♥ with his SLEDGEHAMMER. I decided to cut all losses and run as fast as i could in hopes that i loose mr and mrs autism. I ran through the door i had just came into directly past these to zombie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, only to find... Yep thats right, I TRIPPED ON THE ♥♥♥♥ING DOOR FRAME. My fat ♥♥♥ character stumbed in the only was i could describe as, ever seen a turtle on his back trying to flip over but he just cant because of his fat ♥♥♥♥ing shell. Yea. Thats me, exept with 2 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ zombies on my ♥♥♥.\n\nStill on the ground, the one with the sledgehammer reared his hammer over his head, going for a downward strike, i start pressing evey ♥♥♥♥ing button on my keyboard in hopes that he gets his ♥♥♥ OFF THE FLOOR. Nothings working, my character just wont get the ♥♥♥♥ up, the sledgehammer is then driven into my defenceless skull and I am killed.\n\n11/10 would play and suggest to everyone on my friends list.","August 28, 2015","true","13.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

But there was no reason to, this game is briliant, bloody, BRILIANT! I absolutly love it.\n\nI started up the campaign, and it lead to a character creation page. While the custoization is pretty great for a game like this, I would have liked to see a little more. Then I began the game, and immidiatly died at the first hit. So, I started the arena to get a feel for the controls. And even though the dungeon crawling is one of the main selling points, the arena mode itself is enough to justify the $15 price-tag. Each enemy in the arena behaves differently, and most importantly they act human. They stumble, they miss, they misjudge distance. I don't know how much money the AI programer makes but give him a raise. after dying in the arena, you restart with all the equipment that was on your character. It feels great to get that one step further in the arena because of it. That being said, it would be appreciated if that were also in the campaign.\n\nI love this game, and it's more than worth your money, but unless we critisize, the game can't progress. So here's a list of things that I would like to see in future updates.\n\n\n- A tutorial.; this game is hard, and I know that a tutorial might cheapen the experiance of learning manuvers, but it'd be nice.\n\n- more character customization; I just think it'd be nice.\n\n-gladiatorial multipayer: a 1v1 multiplayer mode would make this game a lot more fun. Though the AI arena is amazing, it would be cool if we could hone our skills and chalange other players\n\n-More weapon variety: maybe let us have a rapier, or maybe let us use two one handed swords, daggers, you know things like that.\n\n-more gore; it would add somwthing to the feel of the game if there was noticeable wounds and blood splatters on the characters and environment.\n\n- and open world adventure mode: I know that this is a bad thing to ask for and it would be very hard to make. But it would be nice to see an above ground, open world adventure mode.

Let me start by saying that Exanima is NOT for everyone. Exanima requires patience, skills, strategy, coordination, and a bit of memorization.\n\nI've read a lot of reviews saying that the controls are "clumsy", that mouse only combat and movement is too infuriating. And my responce is USE THE KEYBOARD. It took me 15 minutes to realize how much easier combined keyboard and mouse combat is, TAB to switch to combat mode, WASD to move your character and note that your character will keep his focus on the mouse cursor, and strafe around that point. Use space bar to center your view on whatever your cursor is hovering over. Evasion works best if you follow up with a clean hit with the appropriate part of your weapon. And then it's just timing, timing, timing...\n\nAlso walk, don't run away from enemies, the enemies slow slightly before they take a swing at you so if you keep moving, they tend not to hit you, running usually results in getting cornered by a group. Also they are persistent in following you so as you walk close doors behind you with your mouse (because you're using the keyboard to walk now right?)\n\nback to the review, the atmosphere is amazing, sure the graphics are a little bit dated, but the shadows and the physics make up for it (except when stuff gets glitchy, but it IS an alpha after all) there are story elements, that keep the exploring the dungeon/castle thing interesting for those who like lore. The enemies are varied enough to not seem too repetitive, and the difficulty scales appropriately as your progress through, however finding armour peices play a big part in this scaling. So you do have to explore a little if you do intend to fight anything later on. My biggest grief with the atmosphere is it's too dark, so for 90% of this alpha you need to carry your torch (sorry shield bearers.)\n\nAlso the Early Access offers no (in game) way to save your progress, which I think frustrates a lot of people. From what I've read the developer does intend to put a save feature in. And there is a way to backup the autosaves, which I won't divulge because many feel this is a form of cheating.\n\nI really do enjoy this game, and look forward to seeing whats in its future, hopefully we don't have to wait long. Overall I'd give it a well earned 3.5/5 because it does lack content, there are a few glitches, the learning curve and difficulty combine to make it more of a "Hardcore" game. But it has an excellent story, that I hope will be bolstered by NPCs once they're implemented. The combat system is pretty awesome, once you've adapted to it, and throwing a box on a Mob's head and getting in a free hit never gets old.\n\n","May 10, 2015","true","28.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theinfinitedoom/recommended/362490/","theinfinitedoom","Gunmetal Buffalo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theinfinitedoom/","559 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe developer is trying something new, and there are some good times to be had with this game.\n\nIt's beautiful in motion, and just about everything is intuitive and dynamic. If you want to open a door, click and drag it open. If you want to pick up a key, open up your inventory and drag the key from the world into your "bag". Want to equip a sword or a piece of armor? Drag it from the wherever it is onto the little representation of your character in your inventory. Boom.\n\nIt feels really good to acquire and equip every new piece of armor and every new weapon. I would heartily recommend this game, as long as you understand that the combat can be *very* frustrating when you're taking it seriously.\n\nOn the upside, the character creator is very nice and saves your inputs from the last character you created. All you have to do is hit "New Game", and when the character creator pops up you'll still have the same name, hair, physique and everything. This game is somewhat of a roguelike where you lose your progress but not necessarily your character when you die.\n\nWhat's playable now is *good*, the developer appears to be active and positive (responding well to my original, somewhat frustrated first draft of this review), and I am eager to see the ways in which this game grows. If I remember correctly, some form of multiplayer is on the feature roadmap. I'm extremely excited to get my hands on some form of co-operative or competitive shenanigans in this game engine.\n\nEDIT: It's probably worth mentioning that at the time of this edit, I've only played 2 hours of this game since I purchased it. Every play session ends with me cursing at my character for being unwilling or unable to perform any sort of combat maneuver. I harped on it heavily in my original review, I mention it in the comments on this review, and I just can't leave it out of my review proper.\n\nI'll stand by the above, even when I've just rage-quit and uninstalled (again), but I can't in all good conscience tell people to buy this game without warning them about the combat.\n\nThe movement has been improved in a recent update, my character trips over their own feet less often. That's about the best aspect of it.\n\nAttacks are still drunken flails that always seem to fall *just* short of how far you expect them to reach. Everybody auto-blocks, which is both a blessing and a curse. It means that all you have to do to attempt a block is let go of your attack button. It also means that your arms are virtually always out of position to attack. In order to wind up an attack, your character needs to bring their arms back to a "resting" position, then wind up, then swing. In the meantime, your AI adversary is just waiting for you to wind up so they can start attacking a half-second before you. Fighting them is obscenely frustrating on any difficulty level, because you're almost always on the defensive. If they attack, you need to block. If you attack, they just attack you at the same time but their attack will either connect first or block your weapon as they hit you. They combine this with movements that bring them right up into your face. It doesn't matter what weapon you're using, you can't hit someone who isn't at least a foot or two away from you. I'm sure it's a valid tactic to try and hug your enemies' offhand side, or throw yourself into their arms so they can't hit you with their weapon. It's just really annoying and  hard to do when you're trying to keep the camera focused and manually aim your attacks at the same time. Characters are right handed by default, which means that a Right to Left swing is the default. The AI has no problem doing Left to Right swings, occasionally even overhead strikes, but for you the process is much more difficult. First, you have to either align the camera to your current facing using the spacebar, or you have to pray that your character can correctly interpret your commands from whatever perspective you're currently using. You then have to "hover the mouse over your left shoulder". I put that in quotes, because that's not a guarantee. Maybe your character will do a Left to Right swing, maybe they'll just do a Right to Left swing and spin around to face the bit of floor right over their shoulder. It's more than likely that your enemy will already be blocking by the time you've pulled your arm back, and moving your weapon to that side leaves your flank wide open to easy default swings. They'll either handily block you or bury their weapon in your side before you ever get the chance to hit them.\n\nArena mode is the best way to quickly frustrate yourself, though I found the "story" mode to be slightly more disheartening of the two. I've run the first ~20 minutes of the dungeon dozens of times now, and I keep hitting a wall, literally and figuratively. I've got everything memorized now, up until I find a pair of dead adventurers, but I can't find any path to follow beyond that. I loot them both, find a few keys, by this point I have some decent weapons and a shield, but I can't figure out where to go next. Presumably, one of the myriad immovable doors is meant to open, though I can't fathom which one or how to unlock it. Maybe there's a secret panel somewhere, something I missed or something I'm not correctly interacting with. Whatever the case may be, I spend varying amounts of time wandering the same two or three corridors at that end of the dungeon before one or two of the zombies suddenly become hostile and hack me to death. At first I tried to fight them, but they almost always have a numerical advantage as well as much better control over their attacks. Trying to fight even a single zombie is pretty much a protracted "game over", at which point I'm left to start over again. I'm no stranger to roguelikes, but there's no variation in the opening. I wake up, walk straight down the only available path, work my way to the end of the dungeon where I keep dying, and then wander around looking for the path to the next area until the enemies kill me. It's such a waste of time that I really can't justify "one more try".\n\nI've been told that this game is much more playable once you find health potions and proper armor, so you aren't immediately butchered by the first angry skeleton. I've been told that with enough time, players "learn to love" the unwieldy combat system. Truth be told, finding that next dead adventurer that has an actual weapon or some clothing/armor you haven't seen yet feels great. The problem is, I've been fighting the same three guys in the arena and running through the same opening 20 minutes of dungeon since I bought this game. Every single fight ends in incorrectly-interpreted commands, death, and cursing.\n\nI can easily recommend this game for its exploration/inventory controls, the potential for future content, and the possibility of non-serious multiplayer chaos or co-operative dungeon crawling (if those features ever get incorporated). However, I cannot understate the frustration the controls will give you. They make my ~2.5 hours at the time of this writing feel like 10 hours of banging my head against a wall. This title is currently languishing in my "uninstalled" category until I get a notice for an update titled "MULTIPLAYER!" or "We Finally Fixed Your Avatar's God-Awful Aim!"","May 1, 2015","true","2.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","4"

There are a few things to take into account with this game. The combat and controls have an extremely high learning curve that surpasses many games. It allows for high precision and control over the arc of your swing, granted you have a steady hand and can anticipate the movements of enemies. This point should not be discounted; the skill cap potential for this game is extremely high.\n\nAs for the general atmosphere, the game features a low fantasy dungeon crawler setting. There are also numerous puzzle elements that have clever solutions. The graphics are high quality, and the game features an engine which was made purely from scratch. The AI patterns are quite sophisticated, and against unskilled players will feel ruthless.\n\nFootwork is important in this game, and understanding how the WASD keys augment your damage by adding force to a swing is integral. The overhead and thrusting motions are fantastic and there are multiple weapon classes with different weight and swing speeds. The different weapon types feel extremely responsive once you are familiar with the timing.\n\nThe arena mode is another game type which is extremely addictive. I recommend playing the arena mode first to aid in developing your combat skills.\n\nWhen reading these reviews take into account the hours played by the reviewers. This game is not one that can be properly assessed unless you've developed your familiarity with the combat, and can master the controls. Otherwise you're listening to frustrated players who want to blame the game rather than admitting they aren't very good.\n\nThe developers are hard at work on Exanima but are currently limited by a small staff. However, it's clear when reading the forums and seeing the responses that they are very invested in this project and are extremely perfectionist in their work. The game is well worth the current price, even if it is only 5/14 levels completed.\n\n\nTakeways:\n\n- Incredibly difficult; not for the fainthearted\n- High skill cap\n- Wonderful art style\n- Unfinished, but continuous updates","May 18","true","227.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Over 24hrs i grew from a stumbling drunken bum tripping over his own weapon, to an aggressive clumsy berserker dashing about performing huge looping sword swings that sometimes connected with messy results, on the way i learned to barely survive by tangling my opponents weapon with my own and tripping them, or barging them into walls, combining sidesteps with horizontal cuts, and overhead swings with lunges forward or back, before finally reaching the pinnacle of defensively keeping my opponent right in my weapon arc and my neck out of thiers while slicing in accurate ripostes to counter their attacks and hamstring them while they flail madly at me.\n\nHaving said all that about skill, luck still plays a huge factor here, the AI is mean, well armoured, apparently drunk and holding some truly unpleasant weaponry which they have no compulsion about swinging madly at your head or sometimes even their own.\n\nBeat the Novice and Expert arena, 24hrs, proud of myself, that was some seriously sweaty difficulty, long drawn out "barring lucky cuts" gladiator fights where you have to survive with enough health each round to tackle a series of increasingly difficult and variably armed/combat styled opponents in a row, looting their corpses after each fight to improve your ability to survive further.\n\nClassic beat em up mortal kombat tower climb game structure, with added looting, hyper-realistic physics/shadows/lights/everything, all rendered in very crispy 3D  with a truly awesome skill-based control system, slapped with a thick gout of blood and drizzled with moody baroque modern classical music.\n\nNot even touched the story mode yet and already got more than my moneys worth outta this game.

First and foremost I'll say Exanima is unlike any game I've EVER played, and I've played hundreds of them. It's not a game that you can jump into and do well with, on the contrary, you will suck at first! I consider myself quite adept at any game I try but this one took me 4-5 hours just getting used to the control system and combat, but that's a good thing. I can't begin to describe the satisfaction I got from beating my first zombie in the dungeon and my first opponent in arena mode, but you must be willing to invest the time. And oh man what a sweet reward! You can almost FEEL the weight of the weapon you're wielding when you swing. The "thunk" you hear when you connect a blow to the head, the splash of blood when your weapon slices into your opponent, and the sound of armor and shield being struck, all these things and more immerse you into the game unlike anything out there.\n\nAt the moment there are only 3 ways to attack- swings from right to left, left to right, and overhead bashes. That being said, with just those 3 I have still gained immense pleasure trying to slice and dice enemies, but there are more to come soon. Once the new moves are implemented I'm sure the game will reach new heights of enjoyment and more hours learning them! This game will draw you in and not let go, you only have to be willing to invest yourself and open your mind to new things.\n\nWhich brings me to controls. I've read a lot of complaints and ideas for camera and charactor controls but I believe most of them stem from the need for instant gratification. You ain't getting that here, but again, that's a good thing! The camera is stationary unless you press the space bar, which will center it behind you, but if you're in combat that won't last long. The best 2 tips I can give at the moment are to leave the camera alone unless you need to see a certain part of the place you're at better, or if you simply have to have the camera behind you, hold down the space bar and the RMB simultaniously while exploring/moving, but not in combat. As for movement, the WSAD buttons stay the same no matter which way the camera is oriented. W will always move you forward, S backwards, A left and D right. It takes getting used to but once mastered it becomes second nature. If you have problems or would like to see examples other than the trailer look on youtube, there are plenty of helpful videos there.\n\nAll in all, Exanima delivers on all levels, and keep in mind what is here is far from complete. I think we are on the cusp of a revolutionary way we will see RPG games done in the future because once this hits the market and more people are exposed to it who the hell is going to want to play any other way? I won't! Buy the game, help support the devs, and you won't be sorry. It's the best 15 bucks I've spent in a long time.\n\nPS. A lot of people suggest playing arena mode before the story mode to get the feel of combat. I suggest starting the story mode first but stay in the room you start in. Find a piece of wood and a barrel lid, equip those and enter combat mode, and get used to the mechanics of fighting that way. Take some swings, experiment with placing the cursor while you swing. Move about while swinging, slide the mouse around while swinging to add momentum. Step into overhead bashes, practice any kind of move you can think of, then log out of story mode and play the arena mode. If you just jump into the arena without doing what I've suggested, you may get frustrated and decide the game is too hard. DON'T DO IT! Take 5-10 minutes in story mode first, staying in the first room. You lose nothing by doing so, but will gain invaluable experience. I stated earlier how long it took me to get used to the controls and  I did what everyone else did, hopped into arena and got my ♥♥♥ kicked. I had a friend over today and was telling him about the game and had him do what I have suggested here. He lost to the first opponent but then ripped off 5 wins in a row before losing to dike lady.","October 10, 2015","true","53.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

It is bad.\n\nYour movement is based on your cursor, not your camera.

I recommend this to anyone who enjoys RPG's, anyone who enjoys physics based games, and realistic combat. Battles I've had in this game rival the choreography of Game Of Thrones.\n\nNow, let's restate. Exanima takes place 20 years before the events of Sui Generis, it is a prelude, this is basically a game to hold you down until Sui Generis comes out, but don't take that lightly, the Devs work hard as they can to pump out updates every week or so, they work 14-17 hours a day all week to make this game possible. I've immersed myself in the community of this game, the people are great, everyone is helpful, kind, and courteous, the Devs themselves interact with the community on a normal basis, respond to support emails and respond on the Discussion Forums.\n\nBut more about the game, the game itself is in 0.5.2, in this patch, they fixed animation and the "Drunken movement" of the characters. This made the game easier for people to play, the controls are a little less than smooth but the learning curve is detrimental to being able to move correctly.\n\nHere are some planned features:\n\nPer session and global character skill progression\nLarge non-linear main game following early content\nBuild and permanently save characters by completing early content\nNew encounters, items and environments\nRanged combat and new close quarter manoeuvres\nNumerous moddable thaumaturgic powers\nMore complete arena game modes featuring outdoor arenas\nComplex NPC interactions and dialogue\nCooperative and competitive LAN multiplayer\n\nF.Y.I. Thaumaturgy is the kind of "Magic" in the game, to the contrary it's been described as "Psychic abilities"\n\nThe six kind of Thaumaturgic powers being:\n\nDisplacement: Teleporting, displacing to avoid being hit, conjuring fire, summoning demons...\nEnergy: Lightning, heating, cooling, electromagnetism...\nLight: Producing or suppressing light, invisibility, offensive beams...\nBody: Healing, harming, affecting body functions...\nMind: Influencing others, various mental effects, mind control, raising the dead...\nForce: Sudden forces, shielding, telekinesis...\n\nWith 3 different kinds of casting:\nSustained: You sustain the effect until you decide to stop, consuming focus for the duration.\nImmediate: The power produces a one time effect, it might also require a charge up time. Both the final effect and charge up consume focus.\nContinuous: You toggle the power on and off. While active, the power takes up a chunk of your focus.\n\nI hope I could help, and I plan on updating this review at each significant update.","May 17, 2015","true","80.2"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

I've never had so much fun with a combat system until I played this game.  Its rather hard at first, but with practice you'll soon come to love it.  While I haven't really done any of the story mode, I spent about 3 hours straight in the Arena mode.  Fist fighting in this game feels so good especially when you land that gut renching punch and you hear all the crack of bones.  One thing I'm kind of hoping they add to this game is some dismemberment, but other than that, this game is a definite buy for anyone who will take the time to learn how to play.

I'm truly impressed with the graphics and physics; they seem very polished. The combat might look a bit funny at times, but it's still very realistic. If you've played Chivalry, you also get that same satisfaction in this game when you hit someone in the face with a warhammer :) That being said, you definitely feel the hurt when you swing at the wrong time and your oppenent counters you in the ribs with an axe. The way the story is told is also something I really like, even though I still don't know too much about it. It doesnt just reveal itself to you; you must figure it out from small notes and such. BTW, this game is not easy, and it can get pretty creepy. The shadows in this game are done extremely well and you may see the shadow of "something" coming from an open door or hallway. This is actually my first review on a game because I haven't played one from Steam that I like this much.

Harder than Dark Souls.  This a game where if you die you start over from the begining without your gear.  There is nearly no healing in the game.  Your life bar can be regenerated slowly but take too much damage and part of that bar can no longer be regained.  In the future there will be a global skill system for your character that stays with you after you die and there will be 1 save after the third floor as well.  Do not expect a cake walk!\n\nThe physics engine is really interesting.  The swings of your sword will change based on your mouse direction, your momentum, and the direction moved.  The result is a very cool combat system but it's very difficult to learn.  It takes hours to get the hang of because no other game has similar controls to really compare it to.  Your first couple of hours will be spent fighting your character movement in combat instead of the enemy.  There is an arena mode that lets you practice combat that I would recommend spending some time in and also watching a few youtube videos to see what efficient combat looks like.  Once you do get the hang of the combat controls then you can progress a lot further.  The physics engine also allows you to move objects to set traps and emcumber enemies.\n\nIt has a dark and gloomy environment that plays well to set the mood and the graphics are good for this kind of top down isometric kind of game.  It leaves you scared to open doors beause you never know what kind of hellish enemy may be waiting for you behind it.  Many choose to opt for the passive route and avoid combat as much as possible.\n\nThe problems with this game is that some parts become tedious.  There is a lot of mouse dragging.  It would be nice to double click an item to pick it up instead of having to drag and drop everything into your character bag and on to your character.  Starting over with nothing also gets pretty tedious after a while especially because the game is so hard.  If you have the tolerance for a truly difficult game and enjoy the kind of top down dark fantasy world with minimal magical then you will probably like this game.  They plan on adding a cooperative lan feature which would be cool but what I really would like to see is a true multiplayer system kind of like diablo 2 where we could get a few people in game and travel together.","May 6, 2015","true","6.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

One dressed head-to-toe in full plate, the other in chainmail. Dramatic music trumpets through the room. The one in plate wields a two-handed hammer, the other a claymore. A clash of titans. They edge toward one another, keeping steady on their feet.\n\nClaymore takes a swing, hammer steps back, then lunges forward in full swing, claymore blocks with an almightly clang of metal. Hammer swings again, risky, as claymore dodges to the side gracefully, slashing along hammer's back. He yells in agont, but this does not deter him. He gathers himself and sets himself on the defensive. The dance around one another, carefully assessing each other.\n\nClaymore lunges, hammer counter-swings, but claymore was feigning, and immediately slashes in reverse. Its over for hammer...almost. Sheer luck dictates the blow struck his hammer's shaft, and grants him precious time to counter. A sharp swing doubles back along claymore's jaw. No cry of pain, no scream. Only blood. The blow landed, and was deadly. Claymore staggers around, clearly dazed. Hammer steps forward, claymore lunges. Hammer dodges back, the sword gliding off his chainmail pauldrons. Claymore swings back, becoming desperate now. Hammer crouches, dashes to the side and brings the mighty weapon directly into the ribs of his opponent.\n\nThis time he screams. His sword falls to his side, his body limp and lifeless. Hammer is the victor. What a fight.\n\n"How hard could it be?" I asked myself after closing the above youtube video. I promptly bought the game, played the game and discovered just HOW difficult a truly physics based combat system can be.\n\nEvery swing of the sword, every dodge, or dash, feels weighty and dangerous. Even running down a corridor I felt as if my character might stumble and crack their face open on a stray rock. This isn't a bad thing. In the context of Exanima, physics is everything, and when you master it, and use it to your advantage, you can be unstoppable.\n\nBut it takes time, training, and quite a bit of frustration.\n\nAfter watching the video, I tried a fight. Swung my sword too fast, twirled around three times, and fell over. My opponent walked up to me and brought pain down on me until I was dead. No remorse. No mercy. No chance to get up.\n\nNow, 8 or so hours later, I'm dancing around my foes, slicing jugular's, breaking ribs, and crushing skulls, and it feels fantastic.\n\nIn a nutshell, if you're in the mood for some heavy, brutal medieval combat + a pretty nifty dungeon crawler thrown in around it too, then give this one a go. As far as early access titles go, I've gotten my money's worth out of the arena alone. But be warned, the controls take some getting used to, and if you can persevere, you will be a total badass.","September 21, 2015","true","8.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Very difficult. It takes a long time to learn to get used to the controls, to figure out good tactics on how to fight, and then more time making those tactics into a habit. And then each time your character dies, you need to relearn those tactics again. It's a deathly hard system, and it's very similar to Dark Souls in that way. Your character is no inhuman hero. Your character is only as good as you can make it, and that means you need to practice a lot.\n\nThis game does not hold your hand.\n\nI've sunken almost two hours into the game and I've still only managed to beat the first 4 levels of the arena on novice difficulty.\n\nA lot of people will be scared away by this. It seems a game made for hardcore gamers, and it is. It was made for the likes of those whom play Dark Souls, and admittedly, I'm not one of those.\n\nBut I still managed to get into this game. The story is told to you in fragments, you don't really know what's going on, but it catches hold of you.\n\nThe combat system does so even more.\n\nIt's tough because some of the controls are clunky. The fact that you must move your mouse a certain way to strike with more power, or in a certain direction is not something even hardcore gamers are used to. It's very much a system I would think would work better with a Wii or other motion controller.\n\nFurthermore, movement is clumsy. It's impossibly hard to go where you want to go, and because these movement controls apply relative to your character, you have to pay constant attention to which way your character is facing, rather than trusting a camera angle.\n\nBut all of this, while they should be cons, feel...

Because lets face it, the old review sucked.\n\nTL;DR: If you like dungeon crawlers, but you are also tired of the endless "PIXELATED ROGUE-LIKE DUNGEON CRAWLER" thing, and require something with far more depth to it, I'd reccomend Exanima.\n\n8.5/10, have been reccomending to friends.\n\nExanima has got to be one of the most challenging RPG's I've played in a long while, something akin to Dark Souls. The game is simply beautiful, with its dynamic lighting, and has really cured my Dungeon Crawling itch.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPro's\n-Quite atmospheric. The lighting, music, and mystery of the story makes for an excellent atmosphere. My main worry before buying this masterpiece of a game was that I would not be immersed in the isometric style of the game. I could not have been more wrong. While I do have only 24 hours in the game, dont be decieved. I spent every hour of that being fully engaged.\n\n-The game looks great. I absolutely love great lighting in video games, and Exanima delivered. You start out the campaign in a completely pitch black room, save for a single torch. You hold on to that torch. You love that torch. You WORSHIP that torch, because you will need its warming light for sure throughout the story. The main story of the game takes place exclusevely in a very large dungeon (as of 11/20/2015,) and in some areas it is pitch black. I remember at one point in particular I came to a lightless hallway, and decided not to pull my torch out. I ended up with a sledgehammer to the face. Oh, you can use the torch as a club of righteous burning fury, so if you find you forgot to equip a weapon, you can beat your enemies with it.\n\n-The physics engine is very nice. The developers used their physics engine to power the combat style of the game. To attack, you click and hold, and your character swinds towards where you cursor is on the screen. If you attack, and move your mouse, your character will follow in tow, adding more force, and therefor, more possible damage to your weapon.\n\n-Design. While most of the weapons and armor have your standard rpg look to them, some of the later in game items have a very distinct look to them. Not gonna spoil, but the fourth level has a lot of pleasant, and one big and not so pleasant, surprises.\n\nCon's\n-Animation could use some touching up. Nothing game breaking or bad, just looks a bit silly when sprinting. Especially when enemies take off running because they know they are about to get this ax in their face. The way the sprint off just looks goofy.\n\n-This really strange speed glitch. Everynow and then, mostly when I just load up a game, the game looks as though its running on a hyper speed. It only last about 5 seconds and then the game fixes itself.\n\n-Its a tech demo, but doesn't feel that way. Not until you look at the length of what's available to play. As of 11/29/2015, there are 4 levels with the 4th level not fully playable YET. The devs are still active, having just released pretty nice update that added the vary 4th level I just mentioned. As the devs develope on, I am sure this con will be edited out.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIts a tech demo. Yes, a tech demo that was released as a seperate game. Bare Mettle games is currently still workping on their main game Sui Generis. With just what Exanima and the few videos on their YouTube channel show about it, Sui Generis looks extremely promising, and I cannot wait for it to be released.","September 30, 2015","true","83.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Rather than a fluid and deadly dance, what we have here is a drunken shuffle with swords. Characters lurch around like your uncle after too many beers, holding onto only the tiniest semblance of finesse and balance. The first thing that must be improved is the combat movement. Rather than big lurching steps, it should be smaller, more responsive and much more fluid. This would make dashing more important as well, helping you score a telling blow after your enemy leave themselves exposed. A lot of the time I would find myself ramming my opponent instead, due to not being able to control the size of my movement. If I didn't get closer, I would be out of reach, If I did move closer, we would start cuddling. Another option I'd like to see is an easy movement or key combination for a straight stab, which would be useful in aforementioned cuddling situation. Another implementation I'd like to see is a guard break or sword beat, meaning you would knock their weapon aside for a moment if you hit it hard enough, breaking their parry and allowing you to land a strike. I'd also like to talk about the tracking system in combat. I find myself spinning a full 360, no matter how much I keep my cursor in position in front of me and on the enemy. Perhaps slightly more tracking would help keep your bearings and get that sissy ballet stuff where it belongs.

Now that does not mean that the controls to manipulate said combat system are good, frankly they are sort of bad, the camera is a ***** to control and the combat turns out to be a drunken brawl sometimes. I think that the controlls play a big part in the "drunkenness" of the combat, your character gets flung around as you try to swing from left to right, becouse the mouse controlls the attack direction (sort of like mount & blade) and the mouse also controls the facing of your character.\n\n-> The level design, atmosphere and especially the graphics are beyond amazing\n\nAll in all a good game (hopefully one day they figure out a better control scheme and then the game might just become one of those rpg classics if they build a good game world around these mechanics)","August 5, 2015","true","39.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Currently (early access review), this game has permadeath and a fixed room layout with some randomness to items in chests, lockers, and on fallen enemies. You are going to die. You will learn what rooms are safer and where some gear is stashed and with practice, you will explore further.\n\nWhat makes this game really stand out is the physics of combat. Weapons have heft to them and will hit harder or softer based on your momentum, the part of the weapon that strikes, and the armor in that striking spot. Bladed weapons cause permanent damage against poorly armored bodies, blunt weapons will cause temporary damage through armor, and you can die from either. You can parry attacks based on your facing and the angle of the incoming strike. You can evade away or close the distance in a clutch to negate most if not all of the incoming swing's damage. You can cancel your attacks in feint taunts, and the AI will react to your techniques... every single combat encounter is life threatening. Multiple attackers will try to surround you and corner you... their attacks can and will hurt each other... lighting will frequently be a disadvantage... objects will get in the way... your inventory will only let you use your two hands to hold a weapon, a torch, a shield, but never all three at once, so do you open a door into the dark with a shield at the ready, or do you hold your torch and hope to not see a mace raised and ready to strike...\n\n... and there is supposed to be even more added as this game develops... ranged weapons, magic, skill trees... but as-is, this game's engine is amazing to watch and very rewarding to use once you get through the learning curve.\n\nThere are some current glitches of clipping errors (losing keys behind locked doors), no active in-game hints, objects on the ground aren't the easiest to pick up until you learn the better pixel areas to grab, and your in-hand gear will often snag on the walls or room objects, leading to oddly twisted limb graphics... but its early access... you have to expect bugs, and despite the bugs, this game is TOTALLY worth the price, right now.\n\nI can't wait to see what this develops into!","May 2, 2015","true","8.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

What I like about the game—for all its well earned reputation for exceptional difficulty—is that once you get the hang of combat, it starts to feel very statifying, physical, and remains always dangerous. It is not at all about how quickly you can mash buttons and swing the mouse around, but rather a highly tactical system where you have to think about the most effective use of the weapon in your avatar's hands and the weaknesses the enemy reveals that you can exploit physically. Even hits from weak enemies can be lethal, if you are careless in exposing an opportunity. And, of course, the same goes for your enemies. In short, combat in Exanima feels more "real" than any game not based around firearms I've personally ever played: real in a satisfying and very fun way, once you get the hang of it. Getting the hang of it does requires patience and a willingness to try something new.\n\nIt's definitely important to try the arena for several hours before venturing into the dungeon. You have to think before you act, if you want to have to a chance at getting anywhere. There are VERY few health potions—none at all in the arena—and some injuries are permanent without them. But it is worth sticking it out, no question, if for no other reason than the satisfaction of physically and tactically defeating your enemies one by one in Exanima's very interesting combat system, and gradually improving your gear in a realistic way.\n\nI admit the dungeon crawl itself is not among the more interesting out there in the gaming world, nor is the story particularly compelling at this time. For me, the interest in the game is all about the physics of the world and combat, as well as the terrific atmosphere. It is very difficult, certainly, but the sense of accomplishment is palpable.\n\nA couple more hints: 1) Combat in Exanima is far more about your avatar's positioning and exploiting opportunities than frenetically thrashing your weapon around, or using brute force. You simply can't muscle or button-mash your way to success. 2) Counter-attacks are often more successful than atttacks. 3) If you can avoid a combat encounter, you probably should. (Remember that bit about the very few health potions and permanent injuries?) 4) Mind your surroundings. Your avatar can trip up and fall flat on his face; but, hilariously, so can your enemies.\n\nThe game is still in early access (0.5.3) as I write this review, but I believe it is fully worth the support of the gaming community.\n\nI think the only thing I really wish the game had is a PvP arena mode, or dungeon co-op mode. That would be fun!\n","September 5, 2015","true","6.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

It is a mixture of frustration and excitement, mingled with the joy that i find myself feeling whenever i choose to delve into its dark and mysterious world. The fact that the story is not laid out in front of you is a challenge that almost anyone who has ever played an RPG would be more than happy to take. Every time you find a parchment, a book, or even a signficant room - it's like lighting a candle in a dark room: the more candles you light, the more you can see and understand. It can be interpreted any way you want. Some people may see it as a story of death and destruction, and others may see it as a story of heroics in a time when heroes were few and far between. You will run through the campaign (what's implemented so far) multiple times, and always find something new to either play with, or discover. Unraveling the story of this world is the objective (IMO) - but you will find yourself fighting tooth and nail for every page of it.\n\nOnce you step over the threshold of the first room, there is no going back. You will be sucked into the cruel world known as Exanima - where around every corner there is a different evil, and every sound leaves you clinging to your torch, and praying that you might soon find the light.\n\nWill you survive long enough to tell the tales of the underbelly of the world?\n\n\nCombat:\n\nExanima features a very unique combat system. Understand that you will not be able to master it within the time frame of your first session of play!\n\nI have been told multiple times by one of my friends (who is new to Exanima) that the characters look like drunken hobo's fighting: but i do not see that. I am not going to sit here and say that i have mastered the combat, but i certainly understand it more now. To me, the characters seem very controlled and professional. They no longer flail around wildly swinging swords and -maybe- hitting each other. Having said that, the combat can be seen in multiple different lights - and mastered in a variety of ways.\n\nThe two sides of this spectrum are "realistic/historical" and "Gamey/competitive".\n\nThose on the realistic/historical side tend to incorporate real life experiences that they've picked up from studying historical manuscripts, or from learning other styles of combat (boxing,wrestling,ect.).\n\nThose on the gamey/competitive side tend to see the AI as what it is. They know how to shake up the AI so that it is defensless, and easily take them down with minimal harm done to yourself.\n\nRegardless of how you personally manipulate the combat of the game, each side has their up/down sides.\n\n(The spectrum i have explained above is formed from my own opinion!)\n\n\nWorld:\n\nOne of the most interesting dungeon/underbelly worlds I've ever seen! The world is not only made up of torture chambers and prisons: this world truly feels like it was lived in. There are hospitals, housing complexes, training areas, storage rooms, manufacturing areas: everything! If i had to compare it to anything, i would compare it to the world of Metro. There is more to the world than just the metro and stations. Does that make sense?\n\nThe environment in the beginning is very true to the dungeon crawling genre: dark hallways, cold stone walls and floors, prisons and gritty areas. I find that this is good to have in the beginning because it quietly tells you that the game won't be a walk in the park. The details are amazing. You will find everything in this world that contributes to the fact that people lived, worked, and died there. I absolutely love the detail of this game.\n\nYou will find, though, that the world is not as bleak as it seems at the beginning of the game. I won't spoil anything, but the world becomes really beautiful - but even more deadly!\n\nOne of the biggest and best things that caught my attention as soon as i entered the world was the fact that nothing was bolted down. You can ransack a room if you want, barricade a door from enemies with the items at hand, build bridges across endless pits. Hell, you can even put a bucket on an enemy's head and watch him flail around a bit! The fact that you can truly do whatever you want with the world is a big plus.\n\n\nAI:\n\nThe AI is something special to this game. Each one is different. They all have different personalities that contribute to the way they behave (obviously).\n\nSome enemies you will find run straight at you even if you are not a threat to it. Others will stay stand-off-ish until you get to close. However if you keep your distance and don't look directly at it, it will leave you alone. Some enemies will watch you fight another enemy, and some will join in. You will find that some run away and hide, and others will run to bait you into an ambush.\n\nUnderstanding the AI, and figuring out what to do in almost any situation involving it, is a huge part of this game - and is quite exciting!\n\n\nDifficulty:\n\nUnderstand that there is no difficulty slider in this game. The game is simply hard - and it continues to get harder as you move further into the world. Nothing is handed to you. You must fight, desperately sometimes, for everything you have.\n\nSome AI (like the ones at the beginning of the game) are easier to take down - but are still a threat because you have nothing.\n\nAs you progress further you will find the fights more tense - but still relatively easy.\n\nThree quarters of the way through the current content you will be fighting for your life. it will not be easy. You will encounter enemies you never expected to encounter, and you may die because of the shock.\n\nIt doesn't matter how far into the game you've gone. It will always be a challenge. The payoff is survivng these challenges, and moving on to the next one!\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nExanima is a magnificent game that can only get better as it is developed further. Everything from the world around you, to the secrets it holds - to the monsters that you fight, and the dangers you are confronted with. It makes a reputation as being difficult, but rewarding. Anyone who is interested in hardcore roleplaying games should definitely pick this up. Those of you who are not into perma-death can still play because they have early checkpoints: but understand that there will not always be checkpoints to fall back on!\n\nWilly McBride\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 1  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il7n2qbzHu0\n\nPart 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mCrfFVB9Ik\n\nPart 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQk2UfUD3lk\n\nPart 4:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ey7EtOBAQQ\n\nPart 5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeHteHAse2Y\n\nPart 6 (Finale): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMJ6WNjaQ1A","August 17, 2015","true","86.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The environments are creepy, and it's dark and you don't know what you're going to find.  I like that the game doesn't hand hold you and you have to explore and try different things.  The arena is also a fun past time if you just want to do some combat. Right now there's not a ton of levels and content, but it's well worth 20 hours or so and the developers have been adding some great stuff.

The atmosphere is spot on for the type of dugeon crawler/adventure type game it is, combat is very satisfying once you gain some experience with its hard to learn but interesting mechanics and physics and there is a real sense of danger when you are surrounded by multiple enemies or something strong is chasing you down. The physics based looting, combat and movement means you can have a real tactical advantage by putting chairs, benches, wood planks and anything else you can throw between you and your target, sometimes tripping over furniture that you have thrown at them. Healing salves are rare and far between, so some thought and consideration in your actions is highly advised, not all enemies will be hostile towards you immediatly. Items and equipment gained a bit later on feels like it really makes a difference when attacks that used to do half your health or most of it, hardly do anything once you equip a bit of leather armour or chain mail abit further in. There is still much missing, most of the story, more levels, enemy variety and more choice in equipment, but I would recommend picking this up and supporting this developer. I'm hooked in and looking forward to seeing what else they bring to this game.","March 28","true","12.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

It combines solo combat from Mount and Blade with the isometric view of Diablo and the difficulty of a Souls game. Combat feels almost like you need to be lucky to score more hits than an opponent, though it does make logical sense. The physics are a little rough, but they are mostly real feeling. Blocking a door with a book case is a viable escape plan.\n\nIt is difficult. Don't expect to be able to jump right in and do well. This isn't like Dark Souls; you've probably never experienced anything quite like it before. You are puny and pathetic like your enemies until you learn to be better and out-gear them. The enemies see your weakness and will punish you for it if you let them. This is a nice, challenging and oh so frustrating game so far.

Having that said, let's get down to what this game is all about.\n\nIt is a 3D top-down RPG set in a medieval-ish universe. Exanima places a lot of focus on physics (character movement, combat, interaction etc) and it's being performed very well. Im not really sure how they've done it, but movement in the game is not fixed animations from what I can see. If you run through a hallway and your foot get's caught under a fallen chair, your character will fall flat on his/hers face.\n\nNot because of some trigger on the chair, but because your foot was caught and was not in the place your character expected when he/she lifted his/hers other foot up.\n\nSame thing applies to combat: If you smack a warhammer right across someones face, it will send them twirling to the ground, again, not because of some script telling it that it was a special move, but because that character is simply not able to maintain balance and resist the sheer force.\n\nThis would apply both ways however, if your character swings that warhammer and misses, then your character will most likely be forced to follow the warhammer with his/hers entire body in an attempt to slow it down and bring it back into position for another attack. That's time that your opponent is likely to take advantage of, provided he/she is equipped with a lighter, more manageable weapon.\n\nThere will also be a kind of magic called "thaumaturgy". However it is not in the game yet and can only be seen and read about in lore and videos from devs.\n\nRight now there are two game-modes, Arena and a gamemode that has not been named yet, but it strongly resembles a campaign-mode, so that's what I'll call it.\n\nIn the arena the player is pitted one on one against NPCs with various equipment. When the player has beaten the NPC he has the ability to loot the NPC and use his/hers equipment. When the player so chooses he/she can then move on to the next stage of the arena, with a more well-equipped (and possibly slightly more tactical?) NPC waiting for him. After each victory the player is also rewarded with a slight healing boost (not much though).\n\nIn the campaign-mode, the player wakes up in a dark room without anything else but the shabby clothes on his/hers back and a part of a note (I won't spoil too much). He/she is then left to explore the area, uncovering the story as he/she progresses further.\n\n\nOw right, forgot to mention one thing... Damage is permanent, as is death, and healing is rare, bordering on non-existent. So be careful when you fight.\n\nRemember, heroes die fighting, cowards live to backstab another day...","August 21, 2015","true","96.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

This is THAT game!\n\nThere's no tutorial, BUT there IS a quick help guide which helps tremendously in some cases.\n\nThis game NEEDS a quick tutorial in the beginning, kind of helping the player with mouse gestures, and ways to make better contact with your foe. You can eventually, somewhat, sorta strike the opponent, but not very accurately or with much force it seems. But maybe with more gameply I can figure it out.\n\nIt'd be cool to see more animations when your enemy has low health as well. Maybe he starts limping, or guarding one side that you've been striking most or more blood on that side as well as chopping limbs off would be great and help just so i'm not gussing how many times i gotta strike this guy with my sword! I love the idea of no health bars for the enemy's because it seems more realistic and different! I love that your character automatically blocks for you, you just have to be careful when to strike otherwise you'll get hit and quite rapidly from the npc's. Maybe difficulty levels would be a nice addition to the game as well!\n\nThis game has the coolest physics i've seen in such a graphically enhanced game it blows my mind! The Way YOU control your weapon puts you right in the battles and makes you feel like you're the blademaster! It feels and looks really great!\n\nThe Arena is a cool feature as well! When you die though (which is very often, at least for me; maybe I suck who knows) You either have to\nA) Quit all the way back to the homescreen and reselect your character and weapons again or,\nB) Click Exit that appears on the screen when you die which takes you to your character selection page\n(the game remembers your gear and character but it's still a pain to go all the way back to the beginning)\n\nThere should be an option to select retry or restart as soon as you die, and the game drops you right back into battle with the gear you already have.\n\nOverall I haven't gotten past the first npc i've met in the "career" mode, so the hours you see are mostly spent reading the quick start guide and playing in the arena constantly clicking EXIT, NEXT, NEXT, and finally back to START, and starting back from square one in the arena. It's all actually pretty damn fun slashing your foes with the swipe of your mouse in an entirely NEW way. Something I personally have never seen done in a game before. That's what kept me playing and coming back for more! Something totally new and I was willing to learn the basics becuase it was so damn fun asthetically pleasing to watch!\n\n7/10 for graphics and gameplay! For this being early access I'd say that's a pretty fair score considering the difficulty! Needs some work and more features but overall it's a great game and I will continue to play and wait for more updates!

That being said, read away.  I say the following with love and guidance, not ignorance and hatred.\n\nI'm reading a lot of reviews about just how ground breaking and earth shatteringly, awe inspiringly glorious the ohysics based combat system is.  The truth is that bestowing such praise to a combat system that BARELY functions in the state that it's in currently is actually damaging towards the progression of this system.\n\nThere is SO much potential here for this game to blossom into somthing so much more than what we are used to, that challenges us and changes our perception of what it is to interact with a video game and I am extremely excited to see the devs achieve this and I wish them all the luck and best wishes someone can wish upon them.\n\nBUT the combat and animation system in it's currant state is borderline unplayable, I love the IDEA, I love the TECHNOLOGY behind it, but the actuall gameplay just stinks, the devs are falling into the exact same pitfalls that other devs games have fallen into that have tried to use a revolutionary physics and animation system for their game.\n\nI feel like we need to be critical and concise about our feedback to help the devs really refine and galvanise this system.\n\nBut I'm at a loss?.... I just play games... I can only tell you how your game FEELS when I play it, I can't tell the devs how to actually improve their system, and I want it to be great, I want it to kick ♥♥♥♥ but I feel like the most we could give the devs as meaningful feeback is just that it's infuriatingly difficult during combat, I HATE the control scheme.\n\nThe way when youre locked on in combat mode that the cameras angle doesnt dictate what directions the WASD keys move you in make it frustrating as hell and the animations need to be more fluid and less sluggish.\n\nPeople need to be able to pick this up and at least have the control scheme actually click in their brain, the way the controls are now, it's complicated and confusing, combine that with the fact that you need precise angles, distances and timing to actually win in combat and you have an infuriating combat system.  I fail to see how a game so full of promise and a team of devs so pationate and driven havn't clocked onto this and actually done somthing about this before opening their game up and making it playable??!!  Most of this games demographic will buy this in its early access stage and now say bad things about it to their video game playing friends because the controls are awfull.  Word of mouth is what makes games like this successful!  You've just damaged your buisness model!!!\n\nThe devs need to very quickly get some taleneted, experienced, pationate animators and gameplay designers on board, use the money they've gained from the sales of the early access and get the combat and controls working ASAP.\n\nThese devs are coders, not designers and it shows, no offence, you need to get the right people for the right job on this.\n\nI'm going to recommend the game because the more money the devs get then the better it will be (hopefully) but as it stands right now, theres a LOT of work that needs doing, forget "fleshing out" the game world, nail the combat and controls and animations first.\n\n","May 4, 2015","true","1.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"

The combat system in Exanima fills that void and sets a new standard for low fantasy medieval combat, truthfully what excites me most about it is the notion that if this game is moddable all the wonderful that can be revisited using this wonderful system, I shall explain.\n\nFirst off, there is a learning curve, like learning to swim you'll have to figure out the combat system through practice which the Arena is really good for. After a lot of trial and error you'll start to learn the new system and adapt to it's unique mechanics, what begins to form is and intuitive display of medieval combat that really plays out like real combat. There is no arbitrary "% chance to block" your character will always do their best to block an incoming attack, unless of course you're in the middle of an attack and have left yourself open, the same rule applies to your opponent. What you get is a contest of timing which rewards a strong grasp of the mechanics and punishes a weak one, basically you get a lot stronger the more you practice and if you neglect what you've learned you'll lose some of the skill you've gained, just like real swordsplay.\n\nWhat plays out is often a careful ballet of thrusts, parries and counter thrusts but there's also pushing, stumbling, tripping, falling down, over-extending and general brawliness. Very often you'll recognize the fighting from the choregraphed duels in some famous movies. The duel from Ladyhawke springs to mind, as do some of the more notable sword fights in Game of Thrones, I've never seen a game with a fighting mechanic so detailed it could pass for a movie scene yet being completely unscripted. There are no canned animations, push-button combos, special moves or keyboard gymnastics. The fighting is very intuitive, simple, elegant yet extremely challenging and highly rewarding. A long duel can come to a sudden end when at the opportune moment your blade sings through your opponent's momentarily open defenses and cuts across their throat in a spray of blood with the full momentum of your body leaning into the swing. Of course the same thing can happen to you.\n\nBeyond this awesome combat system, which I'm hoping sees use in vast number of user created mods, and becomes the standard for all medieval games to come, there is the single player campaign. This is the part I've only barely scratched, but from what I've played it's basically a survival version of Diablo, harsh and unforgiving, where you start with nothing and through great resourcefulness scavenge enough materials to fight the zombies instead of running from them. I don't know how long the single player campaign is or if there are save points, but the first time you attempt to play through you should expect to die and start over from the very beginning a lot. It's like hardcore mode is the only difficulty level which I have to give kudos to the design team for taking such a ballsy approach. It will likely discourage new and casual players, but personally I'm glad there's a game that's been designed from the ground up to be unforgiving without being arbitrarily impossible. In any case, the Arena mode alone is worth the price and the more you practice with it the better you'll do in the main campaign.","May 12, 2015","true","14.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

So I am not masochistic in no way and I dont want to play all the same stuff over and over and over, because you can be killed just so. Admitted, its your own fault: One hasty retreat backwards into some furniture, one time flattened, one time hitting the wall with your swing, one time swinging too short. Its all in the game and its all your fault. BUT I simply do that, I am clumsy and then to start all over again? After I came so far? No. So there is a savescum method and actually it robs you of the feeling you get from permadeath. But yes, considering all these stupid deaths I had and imagining each time to have to start all over? No, I would have thrown it away by now.

That being said, read away.  I say the following with love and guidance, not ignorance and hatred.\n\nI'm reading a lot of reviews about just how ground breaking and earth shatteringly, awe inspiringly glorious the ohysics based combat system is.  The truth is that bestowing such praise to a combat system that BARELY functions in the state that it's in currently is actually damaging towards the progression of this system.\n\nThere is SO much potential here for this game to blossom into somthing so much more than what we are used to, that challenges us and changes our perception of what it is to interact with a video game and I am extremely excited to see the devs achieve this and I wish them all the luck and best wishes someone can wish upon them.\n\nBUT the combat and animation system in it's currant state is borderline unplayable, I love the IDEA, I love the TECHNOLOGY behind it, but the actuall gameplay just stinks, the devs are falling into the exact same pitfalls that other devs games have fallen into that have tried to use a revolutionary physics and animation system for their game.\n\nI feel like we need to be critical and concise about our feedback to help the devs really refine and galvanise this system.\n\nBut I'm at a loss?.... I just play games... I can only tell you how your game FEELS when I play it, I can't tell the devs how to actually improve their system, and I want it to be great, I want it to kick ♥♥♥♥ but I feel like the most we could give the devs as meaningful feeback is just that it's infuriatingly difficult during combat, I HATE the control scheme.\n\nThe way when youre locked on in combat mode that the cameras angle doesnt dictate what directions the WASD keys move you in make it frustrating as hell and the animations need to be more fluid and less sluggish.\n\nPeople need to be able to pick this up and at least have the control scheme actually click in their brain, the way the controls are now, it's complicated and confusing, combine that with the fact that you need precise angles, distances and timing to actually win in combat and you have an infuriating combat system.  I fail to see how a game so full of promise and a team of devs so pationate and driven havn't clocked onto this and actually done somthing about this before opening their game up and making it playable??!!  Most of this games demographic will buy this in its early access stage and now say bad things about it to their video game playing friends because the controls are awfull.  Word of mouth is what makes games like this successful!  You've just damaged your buisness model!!!\n\nThe devs need to very quickly get some taleneted, experienced, pationate animators and gameplay designers on board, use the money they've gained from the sales of the early access and get the combat and controls working ASAP.\n\nThese devs are coders, not designers and it shows, no offence, you need to get the right people for the right job on this.\n\nI'm going to recommend the game because the more money the devs get then the better it will be (hopefully) but as it stands right now, theres a LOT of work that needs doing, forget "fleshing out" the game world, nail the combat and controls and animations first.\n\n","May 4, 2015","true","1.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"

No canned moves and animations.\n\nA deliciously grimdark atmosphere, with strange and dangerously powerful magic hiding in the shadows.\n\n\nBe aware that Exanima is a prologue to a longer rpg to come, to be called "Sui Generis".  But there is a large amount of game in Exanima alone.  There are several levels to explore in an intricate, underground complex.  With many juicy bits of lore to search for and figure out.  And then there is an arena mode, with increasingly difficult foes to face and two difficulty levels.  If you end up enjoying the combat, you can spend hours in just arena mode alone, trying different weapons and learning new tactics.\n\nThis game is diffuclt.  The controls are quirky and unusual.  For most, including myself, it takes time and plenty of practice to wrap your head around them.  But if you persevere you will be rewarded with one of the most intense skill-based melee combat systems in gaming today.\n\nIf you buy, watch some tutorial vids.  There are several excellent ones posted on the forums and on Youtube.  I can't recommend this enough.

Not sure if more are in the works. I'm writing this as of version 0.5.3\n\nShort version: Most unique combat in an RPG I've played in many years. The most tense RPG experience as well. Interesting physics that works very well with the style of the game.\n\nSo, the first thing to note is that combat in Exanima is unlike any other RPG I've ever played. The closest I could describe it as would be to take Mount and Blade's combat, throw it into an isometric RPG like Diablo, and then add a heavy dose of physics. It takes a little getting used to, but that's not too surprising since it's so different. Some people can get frustrated, but give it a few hours of honest trying. Try different weapons. They all handle differently and have their perks. I found it to be a very satisfying system that generated new thrills in each encounter both in the arena and in the dungeon.\n\nSpeaking of which, I enjoyed both game modes thoroughly. Arena mode should definitely be played first, unless you like to die due to unfamiliar controls. Being in the arena gives you a great sense of progression as you down each opponent and loot their gear. Opponents get more and more aggressive and are generally smart.\n\nThe dungeon mode is very atmospheric and is quite tense. More tense than any isometric RPG I've ever played. In fact, extend that to RPGs in general. Once you get decent gear, learn how to survive, and take out a few zombies, the tension eases a bit. However, death still comes easily in this game. The tension also comes from the copious amounts of shadow in this game. You'll be stuck carrying a light source for most of the adventure mode.\n\nThere's not a whole lot actual game content in this at least just yet. However, I'm not at all disappointed in my purchase. I can't wait for either more content or for the release of Sui Generis, the game for which this is a prelude to.","October 2, 2015","true","72.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Single player with intense dungeon crawling levels and the newer Arena fighting. I've had the game for some time now, but when they added the arena stuff, my friend and I spent almost 6 hours learning the ins and outs of how to play the game, fighting mechanics, economical strategies, and fighter management. The game doesn't hold your hand at all. Once the difficulty curve of fighting is conquered, you have to earn money based on fights for your manager (main character) or the men and women hired to fight for you. The money is spent on gear and for wagering in higher ranked fights. The RPG elements are focused on fighting techniques and physical abilities that can enhance your fighters. There is also a great deal of customization from appearance to types of weapons. The only drawback is that the amount of content within the game is limited, hence being an alpha.\n\nIn conclusion, this game has very high standards for an indie game. The combat is satisfying and entertaining.

You must use your mouse to swing your weapons, and to interact and move objects around in the world. Just about everything has collision. Enemies can hurt each other; AI is engaging, although zombie like in many ways in the current iteration.\n\nThe game involves a lot of survival/scrounging in the beginning and is more about steady exploration/discovery than pure dungeon running and looting.\n\nExanima has a dark and minimalist low-fantasy setting.

You survived ... And the other guy is lying bloodied on the floor, pat yourself on the back and eat a cookie, you have done it and survived another brutal fight (cause here when a character dies here they die for good, no coming back from a 10 kg sledge hammer meeting your skull at high speed).\n\nAlso note two important things, first is that this is still a work in progress early access game so expect some bugs (quite rare though) and also that its story mode is still incomplete (though i could barely survive the first area till now and there are three of them as far as i know), but it is playble and quite polished showing the serious effort the devs put into it.\n\nSecond is that it's a physics based game, your character's body, your enemie's and the enviroment objects are all physics enabled, and it's not just rag-doll physics .. You and everything around you are under the influence of physics all the time ... This dramatically changes how combat plays out and generally how you traverse the enviroment, running from an angry hammer-wielding dude that can bash your skull and kill you with a single well placed hit to your face .. See that chair .. If this was a normal game you would probably tear right through it or push it aside, but here it can be quite dangerous,this chair can really trip you over and get you killed in the most humiliating way possible.\n\nCause that dude with the hammer will be more than happy to smash your head on the floor before you can even get up, so next time you see a chair while running from angry dudes with hammers make sure to avoid tripping over it, and maybe take a sec to push it in their way, maybe they will fall over and give you a chance to take them out while avoiding their hammer getting introduced to your poor face (usually a very brief, loud and bloody introduction that ends with you dead on the floor), i mean who who would have thought a chair could make such difference in a fight (unless you are into bar brawls), it does here in Exanima, so mind your enviroment and use it to your advantage, got an angry mob chasing you with cleavers and axes, run into a two door room/hallway then close the door behind you quickly and bar it with chairs, ladders and wooden planks, and always beware the angry dudes (or dudettes) with hammers.\n\nAnd did mention i love the character models and character creation here, there are both male and female characters available and a very nifty body type modifying graph (that i wish all RPGs had) along with few hair types and realistic hair and skin colors to pick from, also the gear equipping system is neat and realistic (you can wear up to three layers of clothes/armor and they all offer varying types and degrees of protection from the various types of damage in the game (slash, blunt and pierce damage), not to mention it's quite an accurate depiction of medieval armor and your chatacter will look pretty rad decked in realistic full plate armor after starting out with nothing but rags (and i'm yet to get there but the Arena mode allows you to try the look of items before you buy them, and the high-end items cost a lot of gold, which you earn by winning arena fights), one day you sweet full plate helmet, one day you will be mine, hahahaha ... ahm.. Never mind that, i just got a little excited!\n\nLong story short it's a game for those who want something creative, exciting and challenging, something that simulates the look and ferl of medieval combat pretty damn well, it's all for you if don't mind it having a steep learning curve.\n\nIf you want to get instant gratification, empowerment and to just obliterate dozens of enemies per minute steer clear of Exanima, go play other isometric hack & slash dungeon crawlers like Diablo 3 or Grimdawn (which are damn fine and i play them too, but they are very different from Exanima), these games unlike Exanima don't punish and\nKill you for flailing your weapon around, they encourage you to do so and make it enjoyable, but Exanima's methodical slow paced phyiscs enabled combat this just gets you killed, it surely isn't for everyone but if you can get into it and learn its innerworkings it can be extremely rewarding way beyond any of those other games in the genre.","April 3","true","13.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","7","11","2","1"

It feels like original Diablo with a twist, or two (good twists). The Story is actually compelling and rather well written, something rare in games recently. I really like the controls once you get used to them and the arena mode is a nice addition! The artificial intelligence seems complex and has potential.\n\nI was somewhat skeptical and turned off by the quirky animations at first (from seeing trailers) but after playing it and seeing all the details I got immediately hooked and it all makes sense within the physics based world and it's very fun to play around and fight. It also adds a lot of personality. The art is very well done (the UI could use some work though, mostly the fonts that could be simpler)   and the game runs SMOOTH. It's so well optimized, I haven't seen anything like this lately. Custom engines FTW.\n\nVery unique game with lots of potential. I haven't beaten it and I'm scared of going on.

It is a game purposely made as a prequel of Sui Generis, an ambitious RPG made by the same devs that'll use the same physics-based combat.\n\nExpect something unfinished, yet highly enjoyable and innovative. Fight mechanisms seems very odd at first but you may become a little more skillful after practicing several hours in the Arena. It is really important to understand that Exanima is not a game for everyone. It takes a few days to apprehend it, yet it depends on how you approach it and every encounter may cause you to die. You cannot save in Story Mode and death is rather quick and punishing.\n\nExanima was initially created for a community to emerge about Bare Mettle's project that is Sui Generis, so, before writing any review about this game, be it positive or negative : be patient, try and master the combat system and only then you can give your opinion. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to be rude here, I wanted this to be clear for those who plan to purchase the game, because then you might have a real gem in your hands that is Exanima.

Even if they're the best they can possibly be for this kind of game and they work really well once mastered, they are awful to learn. That and the fans are usually pretty "MLG git gud" as with any slightly obscure and dificult game.\nIt is pretty fun once you get down to brass tacks though and the price is certainly fair. That's easily enough to earn my reccommendation.\n\nEdit: Physics based puzzling makes me want to ♥♥♥♥ing die, two hours fidgeting trying to stack a stool on top of a chair to block yet another lever mechanism. No reward can be worth this sheer anti-fun.\n\nOh I got a chainmail coif as a reward? Well ♥♥♥♥ 10/10 masterpeice of gaming Bare Mettle does it again and I will literally fight anyone who disagrees. Seriously I have literally never gotten one of those in the dungeon before.\n\n(Please don't make these puzzles non-optional in Sui-Generis, I know some people really had fun with this, and I did too at first but I would be really bumbed out if I had to do a lot of this)","November 17, 2015","true","219.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Not a button masher so it takes time to learn, patience to play.  It does need a save function....I hate starting all over after death.  So beware...difficulty and no save function can equal frustration.  Lastly, no clear manual on the game mechanics.  Took me a while to figure out how to use a key.  Also, items are so small...for a person who uses readers to see fine print, this can be a problem.\n\nHaving said that I enjoy the game, even though I've played 8 hours and havent gotten past the first level.  It has a setting and atmosphere that I love, decent graphics, and most important realism.  I kinda wish there were no stats on weapns and armour.  I'd prefer to choose gear based on its discription (i.e. replace a rusty item with a sharp bejeweled one).  I hope the developers keep tweaking the game.  I want it to simulate what I may be able to do If I were the dungeon, it seems to be in that spirit.\n\nCan I recommend it. Yes.

The movement is tailored to your characters pov rather than the player. What I mean is that if your character is facing towards the top of your monitor, the controls will seem completely normal. However, the second your position or direction is changed all of your movement controls change suddenly and without warning. At first I had absolutely no idea what was going on because I was moving all over the place rather than where I wanted. Once I realized what was going on I understood but it did not make it easier. If you are used to every other game with awsd controls this game will confuse the living crap out of you and will be quite agitating unless you play it enough to get used to the controls, which depending on the person could take a short time to a long time. I actually hope this changes and it could be that the directional buttons and awsd would move you in the same directions every time regardless of your characters direction, I think that would make the game a lot easier to get into without the muscle memory getting in the way. Aside from that my only complaint is they need to make dual weilding a thing. I have no idea if it is planned or being looked into but I think it would be interesting to see. Maybe it would be hard to balance with the mechanics of this game but I would still like to see it. Other than those things I think this game is pretty good and has promise.","August 26, 2015","true","0.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Okay, I'll keep this simple: Exanima is an amazing AMAZING dungeon-crawler type RPG. It ushers forth the feeling you get playing Diablo or Neverwinter Nights. Music/Graphics all are fitting and beautiful. I like the lighting style. Now the one thing that everyone says is difficult is the controls. In specific, combat. I can't blame them for feeling that way, but seeing how complex the system is makes me appreciate the game even more. As far as I know, it calculates EVERYTHING. And yes. That means it's more difficult. But you know what? I LOVE it. Every single battle you have to truly FOCUS and calculate. It's very strategic. And in fact, every battle results in sweaty palms. Every moment integral. It's immersing in a very amazing way. So yes. Battle controls take a while to learn effectively, but it's SUPPOSED to be complex. So it's a GOOD clunky! Dark Souls is easier in my opinion. But that's because battle is a simple mechanic to learn. Add in a few exploits, and bam. Dark Souls is easy. But the battles here.... Now that's REAL life and death.\n\nEDIT: What about a simple lock on system? Because when I'm fighting someone IRL, I focus on them, and usually only them. Just an idea.\n\nRATING: 11 controls out of 8","May 15, 2015","true","10.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Exanima forces and rewards you for being perceptive and aware of your surroundings, with an emphasis on searching every room chest and corpse to either progress with a key or find beter gear. Without any sort of HUD (aside from a health and mana? bar) Exanima very much makes the player look around the room and with no hints to pick anything up it is very much up to the player to interact with their surroundings and pick up what they see.\n\nAside from being this old school game Exanima is very focussed on being a game with an emphasis on physics whether this be to determine how much damage you deal to an enemy as you bash their head in with a blunt object or to hold a lever down with a rock (or to fall over a twig) you must be constanntly thinking physics.While this may seem obscene as you stumble around falling into your enemy once gotten used to clearly adds a huge level of depth to the game.\n\nAs mentioned the physics play a big part in this games combat this also allows the combat to be very strategic and indepth as every strike you make could be made more effective with how you strike an enemy and with what weapon. On this note Exanima can be considered a very unforgiving game with at current no check points or save points this game will leave you contstanly on your toes with the determination to not sent back to the beginning.

Exanima is hard. It's not for everyone. It's a very different kind of game. Different to what we've become used to.\n\nThat being said, what it is, is a lot of fun if you can get into it. Immerse yourself into a high risk dungeon crawler with purely physics based combat. The controls are clunky and take some getting used to but eventually something just clicks and things "just work". At times I'll find myself frustrated that I can't understand how they work, cannot replicate something impressive that I did previously, and yet there's a certain joy to watching things play out differently every time.\n\nFights in Exanima are quite dynamic. As you tread down a gritty dungeon corridor the shambling form of some zombie or ghoul lurks up ahead. Having played other games you'd expect it to lurch forwards to attack. Not in Exanima. While some of the foes are automatically hostile others stop to size you up, decide if you're a threat or if they think they can take you on. Many's the time a shambling bag of bones takes one look and thinks better of it. They shuffle off in another direction.\n\nDo not try to kill everything. Attack everything and you die. Health will not generally replenish without healing items (which are few and far between). Attacks can cause lethal damage or nonlethal damage. One regenerates naturally. The other does not. Armour doesn't reduce damage so much as it transforms percentages of lethal damage into nonlethal (and then reduces the total a bit as well). Fights in Exanima are visceral, gritty and nasty. Fortunately most of them are avoidable. Patrolling ghouls can be lured into empty rooms and then the doors shut upon them, locking them in.\n\nTo begin with darkness will be your greatest enemy. Take the torch. The torch brings light. Unfortunately it also brings it's own problems. When one hand is occupied with the torch it cannot also be used to bear a shield or assist in the use of a two handed weapon. Enemies thrive in the dark. In the earlier portions of the game you'll really need the torch to see where you're going.\n\nThe game also currently features an Arena mode to hone your fighting skills. This is quite a popular feature with many players although I have yet to fully master it.\n\nWhile this game is still in Early Access it's been quite a positive experience. The devs are supporting it with updates. More features are planned. Some of these have already been implemented. There should be a list on the game's store page. Overall I'd highly recommend this game if you like difficult challenges that feel very rewarding but are hard to master.","June 1, 2015","true","80.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

I played a game year ago similar to this and this one comes out on top easy while keeping all the same elements. Right now there are two game mods, both are amazing.\n\nFirst off you have the adventure "Story" mode. In this mode you spawn with nothing but the clothes on your back. You see a torch and grab it since it's really your only light source and possibly the only things you got to smack something with. With that you head off in a physics based adventure. My first task was trying to open up the door without knocking myself down when I smacked my face with it. In good time I managed to get the door open and head down a hallway. I saw a lot of these hallways and got lost everytime I've been in them. I could only remember the first two doors, the rest became a jumbled mess. I eventually came face to face with my first opponent. I grab my torch and start smacking the zombie looking thing. Within seconds I'm on the floor beeling. This repeats about nine or so times. I do eventually kill him and get his axe he was wileding. I find a chest in the room which I find randomizes each time I kill that guard. Sometimes I found leggings, other I found metal staves and daggers. It was a nice touch that adds to the dynamic of gameplay.\n\nIn the end of all this I could never make it past three enemies. Not at once, alone. The A.I. in this game is tough, and they will whoops your ♥♥♥ many a time. I have a good understanding of the combat from the ingame help, which I recommend reading the settings menu for combat help. With that I could hold my own, but all it took was the drunk looking oponent to trip and throw his blade in my face by accident. It really comes down to timing. You can end some fights in one hit, while others last minutes. I had one fight go for nearly ten minutes once, constant blocking and evasive manuevers on both parties proved to be a difficult fight. I did kill the guy, but it shows true skill because the guy was using a stick.. I died moemnts later when I opened a door and three came rushing at me.\n\n\nThe Arena is the other game mode the game comes with. In this mode you basically get to do 1v1 fights with increasing difficult. It starts you off fighting a guy with a club, then we go to a two handed axe, it then moves up to a two handed bo staff wielding guy, from there a maul and shield. They also start getting more geared up by getting better weapons, spawning with armor, etc. The awesome thing about this is that you can pick up all the loot off of the enemy and use it. So if you run against a guy with a sword and board and want some defense, you just swap out your gear at the end of the turn. You can't buy armor or anything like that so you need to kill to earn it by taking it off of their body.\n\nHonestly this game is awesome. Anyone who like to dungeon crawl, get scares, feel hopeless, die endlessly, and mess around with phusics, this is the game.","May 4, 2015","true","4.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I followed this game via Kickstarter a couple of years ago now. And whilst the team are behind schedule in terms of development, they are way ahead of the industry in terms of intuivity, innovation and most importantly listening to the customers/backers/followers/fanatics...\n\nThe first thing to happen when you play this game, you will die, and at times you will feel you have done enough to vanquish your opponent, let me tell you the game doen't lie!\n\nArmored opponents will take stamina damage... Unless you hit them in the cracks of their armor and you will see a spray of blood, this is more satisfying than I am describing. If you bring a heavy weapon down on their helmet, their legs will buckle and I can't remember if I read this on the forums or not, but will make them very aggressive and clumsy for a few seconds (concussion).\n\nAttacks feel random, but they are not, its your movement, cursor position and mouse clicks that are at fault. Side step an attack, perform a counter on a off balance enemy and you will send him hurtling across the room buying yourself some valuable space. You will soon learn how to feint and riposte in this strikingly accurate portrayal of medieval/fantasy combat.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are weird little bugs sometimes (very rare) and some things do need balancing. But the combat draws away from the main idea behind this game, they hope to acheive an RPG never seen before in terms of freedom. And if you are really serious about purchasing this game, I advise you to check out the videos on the official website, they will give you an idea of the mechanics and how interesting this game can truly be.\n\nWhen I backed this I spent £60 because I believed in it so much, for £9.99 it's a steal...\n\n\n","May 3, 2015","true","46.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I missed the kickstarter, but within an hour in, I can safely say combat is the most satisfying top down experience I’ve had. Unlike other games where animation is just that, this really relates to the overall gameplay. Also, as a roguelike dungeon crawler this is by far my favorite because instead of rooms filled with disposable enemies, every enemy so far has felt like an up and personal combat experience, making every victory meaningful as the next can lead to death.\n\nThings I love right now--\n+Camera movement helps maneuver environment.\n+Survival Horror created by fear of dying and atmosphere.\n+Controls are very easy to learn.\n+Arena Combat is a quick starting point.\n+Smart AI that can be fairly battled.\n+Unique Physics.\n+Environment can be used for combat.\n\nIssues I have right now:\n\n-my wrist is killing me, so I hope the #steam #controller will fix the no controller support.\n-for some reason “action” doesn’t recognize this as a directX game.\n-can’t bring in a buddy (listed in the soon to come features).\n-missing sword styles per sword, at current each sword seems to have one style.\nSee http://elf-comic.thecomicseries.com/comics/9. or witcher series.","May 1, 2015","true","3.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

An original project. The physics based combat is amazing. The campaign is great. What will i have to face next? Will I have enough health to get out of here? How many monsters there are in front of me? Is there something around this corner? WIll my armor be enough to face them? I love this game. I hope there will be more campaigns (this could make a good RPG!!!) It also lacks multiplayer, especially co-op for the campaign. I hope Bare Mettle will take care of this game. If there will be more campaigns, the game will inevitably get a good community. I give Exanima 10 out of 10.. I just hope I won't have to lower it because they leave it defenseless on the floor.

It has seemed for a while can either have serious, move-based combat or physics-based combat (The results being Chivalry: Medieval Warfare and Toribash, both of which I have enjoyed). However, this game has cracked (mainly) the inverse kinematics necessary to make your movements both free and realistic. there is a great sense of weight and you find yourself identifying weak points and opportunities. The spiked wood - barrel lid combination has done me well, but knocking craetures senseless with a two-handed iron pole is also fun. Graphics are perfect for the combat, with a bit of blood staining clothes and hair. Not as unecessarily gory as it could have been (See previous games mentioned), just enough for a realistic experience.\nArena mode and campaign highly recommended.","February 6","true","37.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Your positioning and facing matter, as does the types of weapons and armour you're using as far as speed and effectiveness are concerned. The controls do take awhile to get used to and can seem janky, but you need to pay attention to your mouse positioning and the positioning of the enemies around you.\n\nI also find it easier to avoid the drunk lurching by changing the dash to double tap instead of holding a key down.

I’m not a reviewer by any means but a job well done deserves mention.\n\nFirstly, be prepared to spend some time learning the game, there are game modes that cater to this.\nOnce you get acquainted with the controls the fun really begins. Every hit is registered on the body part it strikes, you can see your opponents head snap sideways or their sword react to blocking a blow. On a very strong hit, their knees actually buckle. Speed and power can be added to your attacks with certain mouse movement as well as stepping into attacks.\n\nSome notes on combat. There is a magic formula of audio feedback and character movement/reaction that makes things feel very organic. You can intuitively tell the difference between a hard hit and a glancing hit. Combat is unrelenting and intense, especially when you are down on health and can’t afford to take another hit.\n\nThe dungeons are very dark, and well designed the one torch you get is your friend. Things are laid out with very distinct areas; workshops, living quarters, taverns etc. all of which are meticulously laid out and eerily vacant. Exploring the levels takes time but you are rewarded with finding items which otherwise may be missed.\nDespite being early access, the game runs very smoothly and has a polished look. I applaud the Devs for perfecting the system over adding content.\n\nExanima will not hold your hand, it’s meant to be a challenge, but the greater the challenge the greater the satisfaction when you come out the other side.\n","April 6","true","146.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

It's quirky. Combat and controls are unintuitive, but comparing it to other games doesn't really make sense. It was never supposed to be like other games. Every item has weight and combat is all about momentum. Since every item has a different weight, shape, and length, they "feel" different. If you expect to run into battle swords swinging, you'll be dumpstered. You need to figure out how your character and weapon moves, as well as your enemy's body and weapon.

This game take your will smother it under an especially fat hippopotamus and tear bits of it off and mash it and thrust it into a furnace, and it feels so good. If you already like the look of this game, just get it. I'm positive you'll enjoy it.\n\nOkay, okay. Look. I have to reccomend this game with a grain of salt large enough to choke a pigeon. It's harder than nails. It's tougher than bolts. It's so brutal that I would call it criminally insane in it's persual of killing you. This game is brilliant in a really really quirky way, and I love it. And I've beaten all of the different modes. But it took me at least 8 hours of straight up combat to get anywhere decent with the combat system.\n\nThis game requires a really healthy dose of patience, because if you ask me it's unnecessarily difficult. You'll swing and a miss and get whacked real good and lose a quarter of your health to lethal damage. Feels awful, any non-lethal damage heals back pretty quickly, but now you have to fight forever onward with three quarters health. Perma-death is on.\n\nY'know what feels amazing though? Drunkenly slaughtering your way through a half of a horde of zombies while locking the other half in bathrooms, because you realized they're stupid enough to do that. Sprinting down a hall barely doging the reinforcements put there just to trip you up and then slamming the door at the end of the hallway in the face of your persuer. Lifting a basket, and finding holy ♥♥♥♥ a leather vest thank the gods I have something other than a t-shirt to protect me. Nervously cracking a door, seeing a dark menacing figure standing in pitch black on the other side, then slamming it in his face as you hear him sprint against it whacking it repeatdly with his chair leg. Dodging in and out of swings against a dangerous opponent slicing his kneecap off and just barely having time to block his furious counter-attack. Using something other than wood debris to kill someone.\n\nTrust me, this is a game of many frustraitons. But so is Dark Souls, Spelunky, and Hotline Miami. I bet those took you a while to get used to. Just, y'know. Practice in the arena.\n\nYou'll do fine.\n\nI'm sure.","May 8, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The tooth and nail combat is unforgiving. Never before have I experienced an RPG that has catapulted me so far into the zone of helplessness. There are times in the story mode when I will catch a look of my reflection in my monitor and my jaw is on the floor, filled with suspense at what might lurk in the dark beyond. Equally exciting are the times in the arena when I will take a hit to the back of the head with a sledgehammer, after which I vocalize my avatar’s pain. The controls only add to the suspense as I spend a lot of my brain-power calculating where I can shuffle back to if a particular hostile starts swinging. Having the room to fight is always nice. I have been in fights that reflect the drunken brawls that many report as blades clink and clang against the walls of narrow corridors. Sometimes the fights are messy as baddies take chunks out of each other in an attempt to reach me.\n\nIt is clear to me that there is a group of people who are going to play this game for under 10 hours and call it quits and I understand where they are coming from. I often find myself exiting the game out of frustration because there are so many variables at play. Even so, the 12 hours I have spent in Exanima has been the most rewarding time I have spent in a video game in my entire life as far as combat is concerned. I started out feeling hopeless, and after 12 hours of practice I have garnered hope. So far, the story is lacking, and that’s fine. In my opinion this is an amazingly sugarcoated tech-demo that is allowing me to check out a physics engine and combat system that was built from scratch. And as everyone knows, cookies made from scratch beat the living ♥♥♥♥ out of that store-bought crap.\n\nBuy this game!\n","May 8, 2015","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not magic I hope!!\n\nThe game is awesome - It's that simple. It's reminds me of Neverwinter Nights with good interactive combat. The dark style is appealing and the combat is refreshing. It's very much skill based, but the controls needs some tweaking, as they don't feel intuitive. That being said; I don't want a more simple or unrealistic combat. A fixed camera behind you character might just do it! (in combat)\nThe games biggest problem as it is, is the camera. Outside of combat, I often wanted some way to have a closer look at things. Look on shelfs and running - or rather walking (as I do) I wanted to be able to look more forward. Not much, but a little more than I can now.\n\nOutside of combat, the game needs easier controls for running around. Turning, examine and picking can be a hassle. If you examine an item it open a window (which is fine) but the only way to close it is to hit the little "x" in the corner. Instead of just clicking outside the box. Picking things up, you need to open Inventory and drag it there and then close every wind again manually. It may sound like little things, and it is. But its something  you do all the time.\nHowever, I like that items isn't highlighted. It's very enjoyable to walk slowly around in the very atomspheric environments and look for weapons and gear. (The fist few times I started a game I missed things, and it was so cool to find it)\n\nI like the game isn't holding your hands!\n\nThis brings me to my next point - a hard one. Saving. I like that there is no quick saving. Because it makes one much more careful and "tense" (in a good way). But after finding all this nice gear, after an hour or so, I died from a lucky swing. I think a healing/rest system needs to come into play. Like in Alien Isolation, Souls series, there are places where you can save and get full health - but you cannot just do it everywhere.\nOr the or maybe a town. You can only save in towns/area and nowhere else. That way you won't just stay out adventuring, because you cannot save out there.\nI really hope this game will be made finished, because if it isn't. The big boys in the buisness will think that these games don't sell.\n\nThe Camera needs a "stay behind back" toggle.","May 8, 2015","true","35.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I haven't been this excited by combat in a game since I first played Dark Souls. I spent the first 5 hours swinging my weapon around like an idiot in the arena. After a while, it paid off nicely. I ended up whacking a guy in the face with an axe and knocking him over. When he tried to get back up, I did it again and then finished him off with an overhead swing.\n\nThe arena seems the best place to start, since the story mode itself is permadeath. I wish more games had an arena mode instead of a tutorial, It was a really fun way to learn.\n\nThe game will feel unfair at first until you notice your enemies are often just as clumsy as you are. It will probably take you a few hours to learn how to fight and who knows how long to master. It’s worth it though, because it’s so satisfying when you land hits; you can feel the weight behind them.\n\nOnce you get the hang of combat, it's time to try the story mode, which presents a whole new challenge. From what I have seen so far, the story itself is hidden in notes and other things around the levels. I prefer this to the big flashy 20 minute cut scene, which shows you something you could of figured out on your own in only two.\n\nOver all I would say the graphics are good. It has a dark atmosphere to it that really suits the game. The sound and music also go a long way to adding to the eerie atmosphere. The crunch of your weapons when you land a hit is just perfect and makes landing those hits all the more satisfying. For a early access game it runs beautifully, even on my outdated and pretty bad laptop.\n\nIt reminded me of Dark Souls even though it is a very different game. I like very much being reminded of Dark Souls ^_^\n\nI bought this for the full price and I'm glad I did, which is rare these days. I can’t wait to see where it goes from here and I highly recommend giving it a shot if it seems like your kind of game.","May 11, 2015","true","32.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The tooth and nail combat is unforgiving. Never before have I experienced an RPG that has catapulted me so far into the zone of helplessness. There are times in the story mode when I will catch a look of my reflection in my monitor and my jaw is on the floor, filled with suspense at what might lurk in the dark beyond. Equally exciting are the times in the arena when I will take a hit to the back of the head with a sledgehammer, after which I vocalize my avatar’s pain. The controls only add to the suspense as I spend a lot of my brain-power calculating where I can shuffle back to if a particular hostile starts swinging. Having the room to fight is always nice. I have been in fights that reflect the drunken brawls that many report as blades clink and clang against the walls of narrow corridors. Sometimes the fights are messy as baddies take chunks out of each other in an attempt to reach me.\n\nIt is clear to me that there is a group of people who are going to play this game for under 10 hours and call it quits and I understand where they are coming from. I often find myself exiting the game out of frustration because there are so many variables at play. Even so, the 12 hours I have spent in Exanima has been the most rewarding time I have spent in a video game in my entire life as far as combat is concerned. I started out feeling hopeless, and after 12 hours of practice I have garnered hope. So far, the story is lacking, and that’s fine. In my opinion this is an amazingly sugarcoated tech-demo that is allowing me to check out a physics engine and combat system that was built from scratch. And as everyone knows, cookies made from scratch beat the living ♥♥♥♥ out of that store-bought crap.\n\nBuy this game!\n","May 8, 2015","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not magic I hope!!\n\nThe game is awesome - It's that simple. It's reminds me of Neverwinter Nights with good interactive combat. The dark style is appealing and the combat is refreshing. It's very much skill based, but the controls needs some tweaking, as they don't feel intuitive. That being said; I don't want a more simple or unrealistic combat. A fixed camera behind you character might just do it! (in combat)\nThe games biggest problem as it is, is the camera. Outside of combat, I often wanted some way to have a closer look at things. Look on shelfs and running - or rather walking (as I do) I wanted to be able to look more forward. Not much, but a little more than I can now.\n\nOutside of combat, the game needs easier controls for running around. Turning, examine and picking can be a hassle. If you examine an item it open a window (which is fine) but the only way to close it is to hit the little "x" in the corner. Instead of just clicking outside the box. Picking things up, you need to open Inventory and drag it there and then close every wind again manually. It may sound like little things, and it is. But its something  you do all the time.\nHowever, I like that items isn't highlighted. It's very enjoyable to walk slowly around in the very atomspheric environments and look for weapons and gear. (The fist few times I started a game I missed things, and it was so cool to find it)\n\nI like the game isn't holding your hands!\n\nThis brings me to my next point - a hard one. Saving. I like that there is no quick saving. Because it makes one much more careful and "tense" (in a good way). But after finding all this nice gear, after an hour or so, I died from a lucky swing. I think a healing/rest system needs to come into play. Like in Alien Isolation, Souls series, there are places where you can save and get full health - but you cannot just do it everywhere.\nOr the or maybe a town. You can only save in towns/area and nowhere else. That way you won't just stay out adventuring, because you cannot save out there.\nI really hope this game will be made finished, because if it isn't. The big boys in the buisness will think that these games don't sell.\n\nThe Camera needs a "stay behind back" toggle.","May 8, 2015","true","35.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I haven't been this excited by combat in a game since I first played Dark Souls. I spent the first 5 hours swinging my weapon around like an idiot in the arena. After a while, it paid off nicely. I ended up whacking a guy in the face with an axe and knocking him over. When he tried to get back up, I did it again and then finished him off with an overhead swing.\n\nThe arena seems the best place to start, since the story mode itself is permadeath. I wish more games had an arena mode instead of a tutorial, It was a really fun way to learn.\n\nThe game will feel unfair at first until you notice your enemies are often just as clumsy as you are. It will probably take you a few hours to learn how to fight and who knows how long to master. It’s worth it though, because it’s so satisfying when you land hits; you can feel the weight behind them.\n\nOnce you get the hang of combat, it's time to try the story mode, which presents a whole new challenge. From what I have seen so far, the story itself is hidden in notes and other things around the levels. I prefer this to the big flashy 20 minute cut scene, which shows you something you could of figured out on your own in only two.\n\nOver all I would say the graphics are good. It has a dark atmosphere to it that really suits the game. The sound and music also go a long way to adding to the eerie atmosphere. The crunch of your weapons when you land a hit is just perfect and makes landing those hits all the more satisfying. For a early access game it runs beautifully, even on my outdated and pretty bad laptop.\n\nIt reminded me of Dark Souls even though it is a very different game. I like very much being reminded of Dark Souls ^_^\n\nI bought this for the full price and I'm glad I did, which is rare these days. I can’t wait to see where it goes from here and I highly recommend giving it a shot if it seems like your kind of game.","May 11, 2015","true","32.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will want to play this game for it's physics, although your character seems to sometimes have issues with face planting. The lighting is also very pretty. The actual gameplay is unforgivingly hard. I mean like lost souls hard, but with perma-death tacked on top of that. If you die, you start over at the beginning. No save points, no check points, no quicksave. The devs seem firm on keeping it this way, and that's a shame, because the game has a lot got a lot going for it and 90% of the players will never take the time to experience it. I've been using the 'save game' hack from the community forums to create artificial save points, which, trust me, only gives me a fighting chance.\n\nYou will need to play in Arena mode for hours to get the combat down. How you swing matters as much as what you swing. I'd recommend reading a "how to combat" FAQ before playing, because the game doesn't really tell you anything going in, and there is a lot of tactical maneuvering required I have over 6 hours into the game, and most of my fights look like the last round of a boxing match where both fighters just circle, and fall into each other.\n\nOverall I like this game, but you either need to have a lot of time on your hands, and a neurosis about perfection, or you will have to fight the devs, and copy save games, if you ever expect to see the end of level 1. I love the idea, but I think the devs need to think hard about reverting the default permadeath, if they want to make their work accessible to a wider audience.","May 9, 2015","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is categorized as positive because of its polish, but I personally feel negative about the game.\n\nIt's difficult to describe; honestly, I don't think this game is that good.  After seven hours, I think it has a brilliant concept that is flawed in execution.  It has an absolute AMAZING idea going with its combat.   That AMAZING idea is pretty crap in execution.\n\nThe combat is, and I think all posters will agree, ♥♥♥♥ing insane.  It's fun.  It really is.  But you will die . . . and die . . . and die.  You click and attempt to hit the enemy.  They block.  They swing.  You definitely can block, but you move slow.  Your movements have weight.  Has the weight of your swings and movements been balanced for maximum fun?  I don't think so, not yet.\n\nI'll admit: seven hours in and I can't defeat the novice arena (a training area).  Anyone who tries to compare this to Mount and Blade is wrong--there you could at least go PvP and end out on top after seven hours.  That is not your situation here.\n\nHere, you have been roofied and sent into an arena.  Your drunken arms flail about as they attempt to roll dice to keep you alive.  As you get better, your roll better dice.  Nonetheless, you roll dice.  It's HARD to come out on top of the AI.  (You don't roll actual dice.  It just feels random.)\n\nDespite my negativity, I think I'll buy Sui Generis in the end (the game this is the prelude to).  I will especially if there is co-op multiplayer.  But I think it will all fail economically.  Why?  Because people play games to be heroes, not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who get beat down like an AI bot after five minutes.  Most of my friends can't stand this game, and I predict many people won't want to play this game.  It puts the developer in a difficult spot: do you stay true to vision, or do you try to make a living?\n\nI predict the game in its current state--and Sui Generis--either can't stay as it is or will be a commercial flop.  That said, I think I'll be one of the people who tries to make it NOT be a commercial flop.\n\nYeah, I begrudgingly recommend this game.","May 9, 2015","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The difficultly is based on how you play the game.  It's actually pretty easy if you play an absolute coward. I managed to beat the 3 available levels naked by running away from everything- didn't even need a health potion.\n\nIf you want to be brave and fight, you should still try to avoid conflict during the first level. By the time you reach the third level, you should have enough gear to prevent most permanent damage. Combat takes awhile to get used to as well. I recommend using two-handed weapons since it is easier to keep your distance from the enemies and avoid double clicking.\n\nThe game still needs quite a bit of work and is pretty short. My character got hung up on the walls frequently while fighting, and it is difficult to equip a weapon while fleeing from an angry zombie (hotkeys please). I also wish the camera would zoom in more on the character- keys are very difficult to see currently when playing on a laptop screen. I also feel the game could use more variety in the environment. I had big issues with running around in circles since many areas look similiar and there is no map. The last thing the game could use is more balance in the difficulty of the first level. The beginning of the game was very repetitive and frustrating from all of the dying. A second checkpoint could help prevent that.\n\nIf those negatives scare you, you may want to wait before buying the game, but definitely check back in a few months or year. Even with its faults, it is fun and shows great potential- co-op would be amazing in a game like this.","July 5, 2015","true","43.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's been a long while since I last went for an early access game as the system is too often abused, but I am glad that I gave Exanima a shot. While it is clear that the game is still missing that last bit of spit-and-polish (it is an early access game after all!) the core mechanics, atmosphere, and overall player interaction clearly show that a lot of time when into the development process.\n\nThe mechanics are such a suprising delight and demonstrate an agreeable direction for the natural progression of the core mechanics introduced years ago and seen in many dungeon-crawl/baulder's gate type games. Adding a new depth of interaction and the corresponding introduction of a physics-based world will set this game apart from those it draws inspiration from and defintely prove satisfying for years to come. I still need to put many more hours in to fully grasp the interface, but just from a short test drive I can tell there's not only depth to the mechanics, but unlike many rougelikes or action RPG types that typically rely on mastery of a cheese-strat, this is appreciable, rewarding depth. There's just so much for the player to work with both in and out of combat.\n\nThe atmosphere was a pleasant suprise as well, as those degrees of consideration tend to get backburnered for a large portion of the development. Textures looked good both from far away and up close, character development was wonderfully, needlessly complex, and being dropped into the world with just a torch, wandering very confused, and getting immediately killed by the literal first enemy set the tone that the world of Exanima is not to be taken lightly.\n\nAll in all, at this point, I would certainly recommend trying this game out. The mechanics are deep, the world seems legit, and to top it off the developers seem to genuinely care about their product. For the last point alone I think that's worth some weight as steam is far too riddled with "developers" selling asset-flipped garbage for $15 a pop.\n\nTL;DR\nRecommend it. I am genuinely excited to see where this game (and developer) goes in the future.","May 19","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(I haven't mastered it yet)\nIt is essentially an isometric combat game in lieu of diablo, but the combat is based entirely on physics. You have to carefully maneuver and swing your weapon about. Left clicking makes a swing, but you still need to amplify the swing by moving the mouse. Alternate attacks are possible, such as stabbing and overhead, but keep in mind that your entire body is a physics object, meaning I literally tripped over a corpse while fighting!

Some people might think it looks and plays a little clumsily, but the way weapons actually clang off each other reliably makes up for a little wonkiness. The game takes some getting used to, and it takes some time to understand the controls before you will enjoy playing. The developers don't update as much as I'd like, and the difficulty of the game can be really inconsistent, but I still recommend buying the game in Early Access just to try it now, and see how it evolves.","December 25, 2015","true","67.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game isn't full finished, they rolled it out to gain more support for the games development, think of it as beta testing (Alpha rather...).\n\nPros:\n\n- Baldur's Gate / Diablo / Champions of Norath feel to the game (aside from the combat)\n- Amazing Graphics and Engine very smooth performance\n- Combat was great (does need work though)\n- Dark and creepy atmoshpere leaves you feeling alone and lost like Dark Souls\n- Medieval theme (just love this era)\n- Is being updated steadily\n\nCons:\n- Not a complete game (While the game was fun I found it disappointing when there wasn't a lot of content at launch)\n- Not being able to save a created character or save in general\n- Wonky animations (though for a physics based game very good it can be comical at times and throws you out of the immersion)\n- Character creation is very limited\n- No randomly generated maps to keep things interesting (gets boring when you expect whats ahead)\n- Only two gamemodes (lets hope the add more things)\n\n\n\n\nThose are the main highlights of my cons and pros, the other things I have yet to disclose are just minor things that have occured to me but I have a feeling will be fixed as time progresses.

If you're a fan of the Soul series' atmosphere and high learning curve, you'll probably be a fan of Exanima. Its combat is visceral and despite the rather unintuitive controls, actually very realistic. In all likelihood, you'll probably spend your first few hours in Arena mode learning how to manage distance and timing as well as how to utilize your weapon's weight and momentum. Admittedly though, the camera will probably be your biggest enemy. I don't know why the devs felt like the camera shouldn't snap to your character's back during combat, because most of your fights will be between you, your foes, and the camera. You will be tapping that spacebar. A lot.\n\nWhile I can't fully recommend Exanima in its current state since it seems to be missing a lot of ease-of-life features, it seems like the final product has a lot of potential.

You can attack and block in a number of directions. Fights between skilled players can look quite ridiculous as players spin, feint, and jump. Mount & Blade: Warband is my favorite game ever, but its combat system is not exactly realistic.\n-Chivalry Medieval Warfare's system: Regardless of direction, blocking is dependent upon timing. Skilled players do unrealistic things like jumping and angle their swings in ludicrous ways that drastically affect the time that their blow lands. It's a good system, but experienced players use extremely gimmicky tactics like the aforementioned angling of swings.\n-The Assassin Creed/Witcher/Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor's system: This system of combat is set up for a really strong protagonist that can take on legions of enemies. While it requires a degree of skill in the timing, it's not realistic (leaving an enemy to your back is a fatal mistake, even if you're a brilliant fighter). Nonetheless, it's a functional system for the types of game the use it; just don't make a game using this system if you want it to have good multiplayer combat or realism.\n-Mindless hack and slash, Skyrim's system: Awful! Skyrim's combat does not entail any real skill. It is the least rewarding of any of the above mentioned system in my humble opinion.\n\nExanima, on the other hand, is extremely unique and one of the more realistic systems. Examina:\n+ Takes into account forward and lateral movement into weapon damage better than any system\n+ Takes into account weapon alignment/"accuracy" better than any other system. To elaborate, if you hit someone with the shaft of your polehammer they'll shrug it off, if you nail their helmet with the head of your polehammer they'll be hurt badly. This means that if you are right in front of your enemy and they have a pole weapon they can't really hit you- which is a good thing, because it wasn't possible in reality. This advantage of Examina is perhaps entirely unique; unlike Chivalry, Assassin's Creed, or Warband, if you aren't the correct distance from your enemy in Exanima and you hit them with the shaft of your poleaxe you won't do any damage.\n+ Semi-Realistic treatment of plate armor; slashing weapons do not cut, but only impart the damage done by the  impact of the weapon (plate armor will treat an enemy's sword as blunt)\n+ Doesn't have bull ♥♥♥♥ gimmicks in combat. Every tactic you can employ in Examina could also be employed in real life (probably). Beating your opponent in Examina relies upon timing your attacks when your opponent can't parry (because they're starting to attack), feinting, or otherwise disadvantaging your opponent (by knocking them over, backing them into a corner). This lies in stark contrast to the spinning of Warband, the jumping and angling of Chivalry, or the ridiculous "mob combat" of games like Assassin's Creed.\n+ Customizability: You can make your character very tall or short, fat or muscular, although you can't change their facial aesthetics (which doesn't matter from your perspective when you play). The layering of the armor/inventory I especially liked, you can wear a gambeson (layered cloth), a tunic, mail, and plate all at once (just like in real life), most games don't allow you to pick and choose.\n\n- Exanima's movement animations, while not bad, could be better. Running looks a little odd, and at times combat will look a little off. The animations look good in my opinion, but they're not as good as what some people might expect.\n- Currently, Examina has no thrusting; while Sui Generis will have that feature, it remains to be seen in Examina\n- Blocking is passive. While Examina's system certainly requires skill to defeat an opponent, to merely parry the vast majority of an enemy's blows only requires that you face your opponent and don't begin an attack as they are landing theirs. To be fair, combat in Exanima already requires the vast majority of your attention, and asking people to time their parries on top of that might make combat too complex for a human who is already paying attention to footwork, timing their attacks, and making sure their opponent's attack isn't really just a feint, etc.\n- Hitting an opponent while they're down is unrealistically hard. The AI is very good at hitting you while you're down (which doesn't happen often), but hitting them if they fall over is really difficult. In fact, overhead attacks (which are used to hit downed opponents) are difficult to land in general. I hope that thrusting isn't as difficult, but due to the perspective of the camera, I expect it will be as difficult if not moreso.\n- Grappling isn't an option- not that I'd expect it to be! In the medieval period, it was not at all unheard of for knights to wrestle each other on the ground and try to stab each other in the visors/armpits/groin with a rondell dagger, but this is not a feature in the game. It's not a feature in any medieval game, in fact, because it would be so difficult to model this kind of combat.\n-The "campaign" is pretty short. It's not story-driven, has no character development, and has limited replayability.\n\nGet this game if you want to try out a unique combat system with lots of detail. Don't get it if you want an engaigng storyline, or a lengthy campaign. I can't say it has no storyline, it has some scrolls that I am willing to bet set up plot points will be evident in Sui Generis; after all, Exanima is a prelude to Sui Generis.\n\nThe combat will take a few hours to get a hang of, and probably several hours more to gain the skill to defeat the final boss in the expert arena. Personally, I'd recommend that you defeat every opponent in the Novice Arena before starting the campaign (as the opponents there are just as unforgiving as the Arena's). Finally, once you're actually crawling in the dungeon, beware that you do not have to fight every opponent and running away is your best option 70% of the time.","June 7, 2015","true","53.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Unfortunately, I suspect that the game is frequently overlooked as just another Diablo clone, due to isometric camera and dungeon-bound settings, when nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is that this is an old-school style dungeon crawler that places emphasis on survival rather than running around and popping loot-balloons masquerading as enemies. Additionally, the combat is less about spamming LMB than offering an almost-Mount-and-Blade level of sword-fighting finesse.\n\nHopefully, as the devs approach the final build the game still start getting the recognition it deserves.

A character dies if they reach red health. Make sure you feel somewhat confident in melee before you venture on to ▼\n\nThe adventure: Where do I even begin? This is the very soul of "Exanima". You don't know where you are, only that your quest lies deep within this dark and dreary old dungeon.\nYou will encounter drifters seemingly without soul.

What a letdown, eh? Less booze before battle.\nAnyway, I've got some more time on the game now, but my previous comment still stand, with the addendum that combat is more realistic than I thought. It's not just about letting your character swing their weapon when you hold down the mouse button! You actually need to swing yourself (a.k.a the cursor) around a bit to get the most out of your swing, or less to allow for quicker recovery; made more difficult if your character is at an odd camera angle. It's a painful learning curve, but a satisfying one never the less. (Dark Souls, anyone?)\nI must add, however, that the "jumping" steps you take in battle are a bit wonky, in the least. It seems to me that you'd take a few steps before you were about to fall over, whether forwards or backwards. The side-stepping also suffers from this bizarre syndrome. It's like the character has an awkwardly high point of balance to work with; situated somewhere around the shoulders rather than the hips as would be logical. This is a hyper-realistic game, but it takes time to reach perfection I guess.\n\nv. 51--------------------------------\nJackie Chan made a tutorial video for this game: It's called "Drunken Master"\nWith that said, once you get over the fact that you move like a disabled zombie, and actually gain some control over the controls, this is actually a really challenging game! I haven't played it much at the time of this review, but it's certainly left a good impression. It's dark without necessarily being bleak, the combat is super realistic (by comparison), and I haven't encountered any significant bugs either!\nThere is one bug where one of the zombies (ghouls?) can trap you in a room if you try to hide from combat in a small room, by basically pushing against the door when they try to give chase. Usually they're smart enough to open and close doors, but in this case... Oh well, just exit and reenter the game and they'll go away. Easy solution! Oh, and don't worry: Autosave! <3\nAgain, I haven't played this much yet, but it's left a good impression and I'll certainly be playing more!\nAlso, can somebody hide the bottle from the protagonist? They're really shluggish with those weapons!","May 20, 2015","true","54.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The controls are overly difficult.  Almost to the point of making me quit.  My recomendation to the devs would be... you have a default button that aligns the camera...why not just make the camera always align?  I think that would help somewhat.\n\nSo far I have tried the areana on novice and am about 0 and 10 and have not even come close to killing my oppenent.  My character looks like a drunken elephant in heat as he tries to connect to with his opponent.  I hate to ask for this but could the devs make an arena mode with no opponent...really just one where I can walk around and swing and get a feel for controls.  I suppose I may have that option in campaign game.\n\nThe Positive:\n\nIt looks good.  The inventory system reminds me of Ultima Online.  The lighting and shadow effects are so well done.  Even though the controls are so difficult when I do get a nice correct swing it looks glorious.  At one point I felt like I was watching a movie with real actors doing combat....taking steps forward and backward to gain position.\n\nI have watched several videos on this game so I know mastering the controls is possible...I just can't personally figure out how to do it yet.  30 mins in and I have no idea what im doing but I think a shield and smaller weapon is more noob friendly than a two handed weapon.\n\nAlso this combat system is original.  The first of its kind I have seen.  This will lay the ground work for all kinds of possibilities to include hopefully someday...a multiplayer game with these mechanics.\n\nTLDR:  Don't buy this if you are afraid to control an elephant in heat for hours.","November 10, 2015","true","0.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","4","7","3","2"

A punishing and atmospheric WRPG that I can't stop playing, featuring the finest combat I've ever seen in a game.\n\nExanima runs on a scratch-built engine which simulates its realistic physics in incredible ways. This isn't a 'press the button to swing the sword' game, this is real-time, simulated melee combat based on weight, balance and stance. I don't exaggerate when I say that it's the best melee combat in any game to date. That alone would be enough to justify a purchase, but Exanima gives much more besides.\n\nThat feeling when you play an atmospheric, unforgiving and unique game like Dark Souls. That feeling that the world you're in is overwhelming and harsh and hostile, but in some way comforting, beautiful and spectacular. Exanima has that feeling, big time.\n\nYou don't have a map marker or a giant arrow on the screen showing you where to go and who to talk to next. Your character awakens in a horrible dungeon and you have to find your way out, that's all. No map markers, no friendly NPCs. Everyone you encounter has a procedural personalily, if you approach them with respect they might not attack. If you charge at them they might feel threatened and attack. If you deal a lot of damage quickly they might flee and find help, leaving you with a two-on-one fight. This is a dynamic dungeon crawler for the 21st century - Immersive is an understatement.\n\nAs an added spin-off the newly-updated Arena mode provides a simpler, quicker experience than the main game, whereby you earn money by partaking in various gladiatorial bouts such as fisticuffs pugilism, 6-man deathmatch, 1-on-1 fights and so on. You can buy more fighters for your roster and upgrade their equipment with your earnings. It's a great game in its own right.\n\nDeveloper Bare Mettle have been generous and transparent throughout this project, always releasing expansive upgrades to the game for free and listening closely to their fans. This one is really special. There are 4 maps as of writing, with 10 more planned. And bear in mind that this is a prelude to Sui Generis, an open-world version of this concept.\n\nThis is the game that I dreamt of as a teenager, and slowly but surely it's coming true before my eyes.

Love the physics and combat systems. Can't wait for the open-world Sui Generis, it looks like it'll be my favourite game of all time if Exanima is anything to go by.\n\nHave to say, the running puzzle was tedious. Don't get me wrong, the other puzzles/traps were great.  With the running one, it was either you tried trial and error running for an hour and a half or you fiddle with wood debris, to keep the levers down, for an hour and a half. I did both because I couldn't run the distance and my reward was some steel vembraces. Why were they guarding that place so fiercely? I found better armour and weapons in the barracks on level two than I did in that hellhole. I proceded to die and had to do it a second time. Probably the biggest improvement to the game would be allowing you to save your progress.\n\nI got to the end, I was fully kitted out and I was ready baby. It was a do or die moment but I had a choice. Do I fight the beastie head on (after releasing it from the fantastical bathroom I had previously trapped it in) or lead it to that death trap? Well the prospect of it dropping loot made me fight it lest the corpse was lost down that hole. Well it knocked me to the ground and shagged me. I wish I could've saved it before my virtue was lost. I don't think no saving makes it harder, it makes it boring. I went through that entire level and practically earned the right to battle this daemon but now I have to do the whole level again just to have another crack at the beastie. Kill the dead, search every chest and cuboard, navigate with only a compass... nah, I've done it before and if I die as easily as last time, I'll have to do it all again. There better be some kickass loot on it's corpse, otherwise it can go to hell.\n\nWhat would make this game a billion times cooler (and looting so much easier) is if you could draw your own map in the journal with utensils and paper you find lying about. No set mini map, just your own attemp at figuring out where to go and which friggen rooms you've already been to. Especially when you've died at the end of a level, more than once, and keep getting confused as to where you've been and where you haven't. It's a nightmare for a thorough looter like me.\n\nThe arena is epic. I can never get passed aspirant but I blame my laptop. It's just not good enough to run the game, I think, so I end up lagging about and bet butchered by an acursed sharp weapon like a cleaver. I got the technique perfected though and it's great fun when it's running smoothly. I hope there is an arena or arenas in Sui Generis. One in every major city where you play as your character. I think it's great that the arena feature is seperate to the campaign in Examina but I wouldn't like to see that seperation in Sui Generis.\n\nAmazing game, cannot wait for more updates. Love it, love it. Thank you Bare Mettle Entertainment.\n\nCool name: Bare Mettle.","January 25","true","35.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

To me, that is a good thing, because appealing to as wide a base as possible can strip a game of what makes it unique.  That's just my own personal bias, though.\n\nThis is a game that rewards you for thinking and practicing  and offers little in the way of hand-holding.  You won't jump in and be great from the get-go, but every inch of progress feels like a worthy accomplishment.  You will die, A LOT.  At first you might blame the game (go read some of the more frustrated discussion posts on the forums) but with enough time in the Arena or crawling through the dungeon, you'll find how much each-and-every keystroke and mouse-click affects your character.  I've probably spent half of my playtime so far in each game mode, and only now am I getting decent at surviving...the first floor.  Hell, that's probably my own fault, too, because I try my darndest to kill each and every undead SOB that I come across.\n\nCurrently there are two game modes: Story and Arena.  The story takes place amidst three floors or sections of an underworld (so far).  The arena comes in two flavors: Novice and Expert, and serves as a good 'tutorial' for learning the game mechanics.  All things considered, you can easily get the $15 worth out of the arena alone and never reach the Expert level.\n\nThere's more to be said in the forums about individual mechanics, but the long and short of it is a love/hate relationship.  Every step matters.  When you click your mouse and how you move it matter.  The direction you are facing when attacking or dodging matters.  This is the first game where I've been able to trip someone over a sawhorse and smash their head in with a mace, and that's a plus in my book.\n\nIf you're looking for a challenge, want to support a dedicated development team, are tired of reskinned and repackaged Call of Assasin's Whatever, I fully recommend this game.  Whatever the reason.  There are few games in my library that I feel as happy about buying as I do with this game (I can probably count them all on one hand).","July 14, 2015","true","87.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

While the momentum based movement and combat is interesting, it really lacks a lot in the user-friendliness department.\n\nThe arena mode was a reasonable challenge, novice somehow being more difficult than expert in my opinion. But the story mode is just frustrating. Numerous times I find myself stuck to walls unable to move, and the movement in combat mode is annoying as you cannot position yourself precisely due to it sidestepping or backstepping. The movement is great in the arena but in the tight confines of the story mode I find myself struggling to just go in the correct direction as turning can be inconsistent, often over or undershooting while turning. I keep finding myself spinning and facing away from the enemy in combat, often with little understand of how, though it seems it takes the long way round to face them after a wide swing. I understand it is different to other games, but the whole system is just too clunky in my opinion.\n\nI look forward to improvements and changes, and will likely change this as it becomes more playable.\n\nAs an arena brawler you could give this a try, it was definitely fun and this wont exactly break the bank. But as an dungeon crawler, I feel in its current state it would be painful to play through as I feel my performance is dictated by luck rather than skill in the tight corridors, combined with perma-death: no thanks.","May 6, 2015","false","3.8"," 36 of 71 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","36","71","0","4"

It is charming and unique and butt-clenchingly intense.  I love the new blood effects, they give you an idea of how injured your opponent is and where each strike landed.  I still wish the camera could drop lower.  Drop the opacity of the 4th wall and don't force the camera to stay in the bounds of the room. at least not in arena mode.

The combat is the most hardest, but fun and challenging mechanics I have ever encountered. I pick up the torch and find a wooden stick. Twenty seconds later, I fall down over a piece of wood. I had to take a moment to imagine Big Show or some other weirdo doing that. I search these hallways and open the door and nearly sh*t my pants. I see a zombie starring right at me and it is not moving a bone. I start getting scared and in real life I recall me saying stuff such as, "Hello! Please don't hurt me, little buddy!" "Please.. please for the love of god don't attack me.." ---... Seconds later I walk into the zombie and it starts whacking Big Show with a stick and I die.. Hands down this is the game of the year.

A little like Mount and Blade but top down, and when you learn how to play it's satisfying and challenging in the same way.\n\nCons:\nA lot of the time you're frantically trying to click narrow items in your inventory and drag them to your player or other things as fast as you can, while an enemy is lurching towards you. Hope they implement favorites or quick switching between weapon and torch at least. Items you have to pick up are also very small and clicking on them can test your mouse accuracy.\n\nThe only suggestion i'd have is probably not going to be popular and that's to allow saving. It doesn't feel like a roguelike because it's not procedurally generated and redoing the same stuff over and over is repetitive. And you will redo things a lot with how dangerous all the combat is.

The world looks amazing, when it comes to texture and lighting.  When you accidentally kick your torch across the room, you're in for a bad time.\n\nWhile this game has great physics, graphics and a highly polished world, the controls are utterly garbage and inconsistent.  With movement being camera based, it's very easy to accidentally turn yourself around and give your back to the enemy.  And seeing as how unforgiving the game is when it comes to death, it can get very frustrating to lose a well geared character to clunky controls.  On top of the bad camera angles and control scheme, the most frustrating part of the game is when you try to perform a back handed swing.  It feels impossible to perform it consistenly, especially when it's the best way to beat shielded opponents.  Maybe let us bind back handed swings to RMB?\n\nOverall, well polished EA game.  For $15, not sure but seeing as how I got this for backing them on Sui Generis I don't mind the issues it has.

Aiming is impossible, there is no thrusting, the head-down strike is too slow to ever hit properly and the lefthanded swing is too difficult to set up and, due to the nature of the movement control, barely ever is even capable of hitting.\nMaybe by allowing the right mouse button to be used for attacking in combat mode, the combat could be severely increased.\nBUT there is only one set of skills so far (skill progression is painstakingly slow but is partitially preserved from deaths) so maybe we will see stuff like this properly intigrated.\nBut occasionally all the clunkyness kind of integrates well, revealing the surface of a truly potent combat system.\nSadly, the story mode is horrible. It's always the same world with the same objects (except for the contents of crates) at the same place. You'll memorize worthwhile locations of good items, like a weapon or piece of armor, and then rush through it. There are no healing items (I think) and continuing on from the last game-state is impossible due to placement errors.\nThe graphics look really nice and the physics really factor in.

It may seem really hard at first (it will punish you for any mistake you make) but when you get used to it you will feel like a bad***, slaughtering everything in your path.\nThe atmosphere is also great, it is set in an expansive underground complex that is filled with undead warriors patrolling it's corridors. The feeling of suspense is tangible as you never know when you're going to run into another baddie; I have opened many doors to promptly slam it shut when I see the undead guy with a rather large axe on the other side.\nAnother great feature is the armour/clothing, it's not simply about stacking equipment into slots  to get a stat boost, it matters what you wear, and it can all combine creatively; no more head/chest/hands/feet. You can stack your clothing on top of each other to get the maximum benefit of everything. For example you can wear a shirt, put some chainmail over it, put a tunic over that, then wear a plate breastplate to top it all off.\nThe only criticism I have is the health, and it's not even a criticism, more like I see room for improvement. Considering how ambitious the developers are for the the sequel game Sui Generis, I thought health would be a little more advanced than a health bar. For example; the game Kenshi has health for all your individual limbs and body parts, you could lose the function of your left arm for a time, or if it is damaged enough you could lose it permanently. There is also a blood count which is lowered by being slashed and bleeding (duh) and will knock you unconscious but will regenerate over time and bleeding can be stopped with bandages applied to the damaged body part, which will also heal in time. Sorry for going on about that.\nOverall this is a very good game that is definitely worth buying.","May 26, 2015","true","88.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

That isn't to say it's not fun, much in the same ways Gang Beasts and Surgeon Simulator are fun.  The novelty of the stumbling combat physics wears off pretty quickly, but you feel like a complete bad ♥♥♥ when you to get feel for it and start killing ♥♥♥♥.\n\nWho knows if we'll ever see SG, or where SG will begin and Exanima will end.  This "game" currently has three levels and an arena mode. The game itself has nothing much in the way of quests or real objectives. The core of Exanima is the fighting system, and you'll probably spend most of your time running the arena over and over before making any real progress in the game.\n\nThe biggest pain in the ♥♥♥ is the fact that you can't save. Although there are checkpoints, you will probably want to scream if you hate the idea of rouge likes and starting over a lot.\n\nThat being said, Bare Mettle has made no false claims from what I can gather. They said it would be different, hard, incomplete, require patience, but it would be rewarding if you give it a chance.  So far all of these things are completely true. On that alone I have to recommend Exanima.\n\nAs long as you know what you're getting into (and paying for), you should enjoy Exanima for what it is, and hopefully what it will become.","May 26, 2015","true","3.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

It took me about 6 hours to complete the Novice and Expert arenas, and even then I still had more to learn about the combat system.

When in combat the NPC can fully strafe around me with his body facing towards me the whole time, this does not work for you. You cannot strafe the same way, its fustrating when the NPC strafes circle around you, while your cursor is on him the whole time and he can still hit you in the back becuase your body is still moving with the camera direction but your character is looking at him with his body sideways.

They feel very unresponsive, especially the movement keys. There's a good half a second delay before anything happens, and as the camera angle changes throughout a fight, your controls get reversed. As a result of this, you have to be pressing space almost every 5 seconds to keep the camera angle straight, because... well, good luck trying to win a fight with reversed controls.\n\nDefinitely prepare to die 8,000 times if you're going to buy this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanrad3/recommended/362490/","ryanrad3","RyanRad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanrad3/","492 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nExanima is a unique game that takes traditional action combat and turns it on its head using physics! I'd say, initially, it's like trying to control a combatant that decided it'd be a great idea to flail his greatsword around while blindingly drunk. In the beginning, it was quite amusing attempting to control this character that seemed to be fighting with me at every moment, but, as I kept playing, I started to realize there was a finesse to controlling the combatant’s movements and swings.\n\nExanima's development background is an interesting one. Published by Bare Mettle, it is a precursor to their Kickstarter success; Sui Generis, which will be an open-world RPG. Exanima is designed to give people a taste of what their larger game will be like, and allows their fans to experience the unique combat system.\n\nExanima's combat relies solely on realistic physics. The direction you swing and the weight of your weapon determines your character's movement. While you use the mouse to direct your swings, you use the keyboard to direct how your character moves their feet. The initial effect feels like you're controlling the local town drunk, but, once mastered, you will be using that momentum to make your swings even more devastating. You can even knock down your opponent if you have enough momentum or hit them just right.\n\nWhile this system has a steep learning curve and requires a certain amount of mental dexterity, the payoff is worth the initial frustration. When you manage to use your forward momentum to crash your greatsword into the enemy, and the physical force drives him into the ground, you can't help but exclaim in excitement! It takes some patience, but if you stay the course, you will be rewarded with a highly satisfying combat mechanic.\n\nThe combat isn't the only thing that follows the physics engine, though. The way you interact with the environment is also governed by realistic physics. For example, if you're fleeing from a nasty group of enemies and find yourself running in a dark hallway, and you run over a chair, there's a good chance your character is going to face-plant into the floor. I've encountered this scenario on many occasions, and it always makes me laugh (until my assailants catch up with me). In addition to chair-tripping and face-planting, the way you open and close doors is physics-based, as well. You click and drag the doors to open them. You can open a door slowly, or, my favorite, swing the mouse really fast so the door bangs open loudly-- that will scare those pesky undead, right?!\n\nExanima has two game modes--arena mode and story mode. Arena mode places you against one enemy at a time in a square room, and as you defeat each opponent, you are matched against harder (and better-equipped) opponents in subsequent battles. When you are vanquished, though, you begin again from the first combatant. However, there's a twist-- as you progress through, you get to keep any equipment you pilfered from your previously-defeated opponents, thus giving you a feeling of progression (albeit a small one). The arena is a good way to practice game mechanics before jumping into story mode\n\nStory mode drops you in the middle of a dungeon, unarmed, except for your trusty torch. It’s a dark dungeon with no real direction, and it's up to you to piece together what's really going on by finding various hidden notes containing information, and by battling multitudes of armed undead, looting them for better equipment along the way.\n\nThe atmosphere of the story's dungeon is foreboding and moody. Most corridors are impenetrably dark without a torch. The dungeon is not without it's well-lit rooms, but those tend to be occupied by individuals that aren’t exactly concerned about your well-being. The music and sound effects add to the tension provided by the visual atmosphere. The mystery of the story, and the lack of information given, only adds to the enigma cake. “Why are there so many wood logs in here?” “Was this an underground saw mill?” “What diabolical goal existed to where something so logistically backwards was necessary!?” I must know!\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that Exanima is a 'rogue-like' game. That is to say, that when you die, you start over entirely. The developers recently added checkpoints for when you reach other floors, but each floor is a huge labyrinth, and I have yet to see the second floor. So, if that is not your cup of tea, then Exanima may not be for you. However, you can always have fun with the combat in the arena, which has a pseudo-progression system.\n\nWritten June 1st, 2015.\n\nYou can find more of my ramblings about video games at www.chatswithrad.com","July 25, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

At first it's really difficult, I recommend for new players to play through the arena (novice and preferably expert too, or at least until the first 4-6 fights on expert level) before attempting the main game. Otherwise there's a great risk you'll find the controls confusing and frustrating and more or less give up on the game.\nThat's what I did anyway, at first. I bought the game because I saw a playthrough of the first level and it seemed really fun, then when I tried it myself I failed miserably.\nBut now I've gone through the arena fights and just finished lvl 2 (I think there's only 3 currently, but the levels are pretty big, hard and unforgiving). I love it. No saves and permadeath means you have to constantly be on your toes (I've heard you automatically save when exiting though, I really hope that's true or else I'll have to go through levels 1-2 again..)\n\nThere are numerous game mechanics tutorials on youtube, I had some help from one of them, can't remember which and when I look now there's quite a few to choose from. I'm really glad I gave the game a second chance, once you get reasonably good at it it's very rewarding. And that's just how it is in its current state, there's lots of stuff not yet implemented, this might become a very nice (and cheap for what it is) game indeed.\nHighly recommended","October 29, 2015","true","50.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The game is both a combination of TES storytelling (mostly Dark souls esque storytelling to be honest) and Soul-like combat. Although it is currently in beta and the early access phase, the game FEELs like a complete game. The physics of the game are awkward at best, but the game formula does work.\n\nThe game beta presents three modes. In story mode, you're an amnesic, stumbling through dark corridors finding your destiny. The arena mode is where you, a gladiator, fight to fame and glory. The third mode which honestly isn’t another mode but it is a worthy thing to point out is arena practice. This is where you are given full skills, and access to a variety of tools to unleash death and hell upon your enemies.\n\nThe combat is astounding, the way you feel when you desperately backhand swing your sword and accidentally cut your opponent's face, catching him off guard and knocking him to the ground, finishing him with a stab to his chest is amazing. Another amazing scenario is when two-handed swords clash, and your sword slides down his, catching his face and cutting him down. This is as close to real life combat as I've seen so far.\n\nIn short, this game is a definite game worth its price. If you can devote your blood, sweat, and literal tears to train yourself, you can become a lowly scrounger to a knight in armor which is stained with the blood of your enemies. If you go into this game, blindly swinging, you won’t get very far. Training is truly what you need in this game. Imagination is half the battle. I like to imagine that I’m training myself to become an honorable knight. It gets me through all the hardships of the game.\n\nIf you do buy this game, start off with arena practice. Learn how to fight, then fight well. Remember that practice will get you through many of the challenges. Patience and virtue.\n\nMy only complaint is that the torch lighting is too advanced for my laptop to handle.\n\n9.9/10\n","February 3","true","21.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Footwork Footwork Footwork!!\n\nI can't wait to get past the first level. <3  UPDATE!: After extensive arena training, I've made it to the portal! that ♥♥♥♥ing deathclaw though. Please put him in the arena. So I can practice.\n\n\nNew edit for new (BETA) updates:\nI've been following this game for a while now. It's gone from "Oookaay I see what you're trying to do there, but it's slightly horrible." to "Ah! now that's a thing." to now (in the Beta) "Clever girl."\n\nI really can't wait to see this game at full force. It is charming and unique and butt-clenchingly intense.  I love the new blood effects, they give you an idea of how injured your opponent is and where each strike landed.  I still wish the camera could drop lower.  Drop the opacity of the 4th wall and don't force the camera to stay in the bounds of the room. at least not in arena mode. Now that I've got the fight mechanics down, it's usually the camera that gets me killed. Give us a classic 'over-the-shoulder' view that doesn't bounce around.  I want to be able to watch my opponent, and keep track of the roamer in the corner.\n\nIt also seems that save points have been updated. I wanted to know that my progress would not be lost if I had to quit. Now it is!\n\nBETA ARENA MODE: legit. It's going to be a lot of fun once all the features are implimented.

Aiming is impossible, there is no thrusting, the head-down strike is too slow to ever hit properly and the lefthanded swing is too difficult to set up and, due to the nature of the movement control, barely ever is even capable of hitting.\nMaybe by allowing the right mouse button to be used for attacking in combat mode, the combat could be severely increased.\nBUT there is only one set of skills so far (skill progression is painstakingly slow but is partitially preserved from deaths) so maybe we will see stuff like this properly intigrated.\nBut occasionally all the clunkyness kind of integrates well, revealing the surface of a truly potent combat system.\nSadly, the story mode is horrible. It's always the same world with the same objects (except for the contents of crates) at the same place. You'll memorize worthwhile locations of good items, like a weapon or piece of armor, and then rush through it. There are no healing items (I think) and continuing on from the last game-state is impossible due to placement errors.\nThe graphics look really nice and the physics really factor in. Layering different kinds of armor is fun and effective. Barely has it ever felt more satisfying to shrug off the blow of an enemy, because he hit you on your padded vest instead the face.\nRecommendable in about 2-3 months, if the dev gets it together.","September 17, 2015","true","8.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

YOU control your character, I don't mean A+up for a high attack, your mouse input, timing, and footwork determins where you will land.\n\n- Funny things can happen with physics.

This game has a lot of potential, and a very hard learning curve.\n\nFor everyone complaining about camera: use middle mouse to change the view, or press spacebar to set the camera behind your character.\n\nMovement is a bit wonky, but that's just because of the unique system in place. W makes your character move forward, but only in the directin your character is facing in the game. I reccommend you use your mouse to move. Right click in the direction you want to go and press shift to run (make sure you don't trip lol).\n\nAs you've probably heard, combat is very unique too. I'd say try arena mode before story mode, just to get a hang of it.

I know I've only played for 1.2 hours, but I assure you that is being generous. I am not a person that enjoys needless frustration and aggravation in a game. Two things this game does incredibly well. The Physics are great and it has the potential to be a great game, but the needlessly frustrating and aggravating combat system killed it for me, but I paid for it so i'm stuck with it. I don't understand these indie developers, and there desire to cater to only very Specific groups of gamer's. If you are a hard core gamer or enjoy needless frustration and aggravation then this game is probably something you'll like. If you play games to relax and have fun and don't enjoy being needlessly frustrated or aggravated by core game mechanics then i cant recommend this game for you. The developer needs to do some actual research on weapon use in combat as well. The two handed weapons the way they throw you around isn't accurate at all, Heavy weighted weapons doesn't mean the weapon is going to pull and throw you around with every swing, it's called controlled swings and momentum, not blind and wild swinging.\n\nI do not recommend this game.","June 2, 2015","false","2.5"," 23 of 46 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","23","46","2","1"

It's absolutely the best combat system I've ever tried.\n- But be warned, the learning curve is steep. I wish there would be an auto-follow-camera option. Learning to use the space key for realigning the cam is one of the key things, and pretty unintuitive for a regular gamer. For me it took around 3 hours to get a grip on it.\n- Watching youtube tutorials can be really helpful.\n- The Arena progress is a bit too slow at the moment. My main champion is Novice now, I'm always out of money and it seems that it requires even more grinding to get further.\n- The Arena practice mode is complete opposite (short and generous), it's a lot of fun for an hour or two.\n- I've only tried the story mode for few times, the movement mechanism is not super suitable for that honestly which makes it feel a bit frustrating. The free movement should be way snappier and especially here the auto-follow-cam would be a huge improvement. Player should enjoy trying sneaking around, but now it's mostly a struggle against imprecise movement, at least for me. So I haven't touch that part of the game much.\n\nSo all in all, the combat and the Arena mode are so awesome that it's easy to recommend this already. There is huge amount of potential here. I personally hope the devs would focus on the Arena and polish it to perfection. A multiplayer feature would be fantastic, even local.\n\n\nEdit:\n20 hours in and stuck at novice (3/6 in ranks) in the Arena. The grinding get's too bad at this point. Fighting tend to require quite a bit of healing time so you need pretty much a full roster of combatants thus making progression really slow. Also accidental deaths do happen which is devastating from time consuming perspective. I would not change the permadeath though, just make the progression faster and more balanced.\n\nI've hammered through the Arena practice mode on novice and expert several times. And I'm still not interested in the story mode because of the imprecise controls. So the game is pretty much done for me for now. I'm still recommending it, but truly hoping for more balanced combat related content, since in my opinion (with these controls) this is an awesome combat game, not so much an adveture / rpg.\n\nEdit2:\n40+ hours in. Grinded to the master level on Arena mode. Everything above still stands. Also played the story for some hours, the story mode is very far from proper game and I would still introduce completely different controls for walking / running around.\n\nAnyhow, still a strong recommendation. Best melee combat game I've ever played. The content is a bit all over the place, but lot to enjoy still.","May 8","true","42.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While it is to the developers credit that they managed to make it kind of sort of work, you would be hard pressed to find a single aspect of game that could not be strictly improved by drastically limiting the effect that procedural generation and physics simulation has on character movement or really any other part of the game.\n\nApart from that, the game in it's current state is very bare bones. With a very limited control scheme, lack of variety in environment and a short game time.\n\nAll in all, if you are not aware of or are not interested in the tech that underlines the gameplay, stay away. The game on it's face is sluggish, clunky, buggy, short, with animations that only shine as comic relive and is generally not worth the price asked.","June 14, 2015","false","2.0"," 32 of 65 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","32","65","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PCforlife/recommended/362490/","PCforlife","That Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PCforlife/","141 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nExamina is a game I want so badly to like, but I just can't do to the multiple issues I have with the game. Before we continue, remember that this game is in early access, so any problems I mention can be fixed or improved on. Also, this is my opinion. This means some aspects of the game I list as a problem may be a positve to someone else. Anyway, let's continue.\n\nExamina is a Isometric RPG Dungeon crawler where the objective is to explore a dungeon to get better gear so you can survive against the ruthless and deadly enemies. The games combat is entirely physics base, so the way your character is animated when moving, attacking, reacting to hits and everything else is done by the physics engine, and so are the enemies and the props (of course). Let's get the combat out of the way. I love it. It is a brilliant way of breathing new live into the genre. What it is, is that when you are up against an enemy, you go into a attack mode, which allows you to swing your weapon and block. You block by hitting the enemy's weapon with yours, making the enemy's weapon lose momentom and not hit you. This, of course, prevents you from taking damage, though even if you do block, sometimes you will still be clipped and take a small amount of damage. You attack by holding the left mouse button to hold your weapon up and you move your mouse to swing it (there are other ways to attack, but that's how I usually attacked). Base on you weapon's stats, the amount of momentom your weapon has, where you hit, and the armor the enemy is wearing will determine the amount of damage you will deal. My descripton of the combat is extremly simplified and it much more complex than how I have descripted it.\n\nThis game is also brutually difficult and is NOT begginer friendly (heck, I don't remember if there is even a tutorial). I don't find this to be a positive or a negitive. I'm fine with it being brutually difficult, but it's the fact that you aren't even told the controls is pretty annoying, and as a result, prevented me from getting into the games combat fully, as I didn't even know the basics of combat. One of my favorite games of all time, Dark Souls, is known for being extremely difficult, and yet that game told you how to attack, defend yourself, how to manage your inventory, and how some mechanics works like how resting at a bondfire may refill your estus flask (a healing item), but it revives every enemy on the map except mini bosses and bosses. I wish this game would just explain the basics and players can find out the advanced tactics and mechanics on there own.\n\nThe level design is pretty good. Nothing really special about it, so not much to talk about.\n\nThere are two modes. The first one which I believe is called adventure, and the second on called arena. Adventure is where you explore a dungeon to get better gear so you can face the enemies ahead. Arena is my favorite mode, it's where you go up a enemy 1v1 in a small arena. If you defeat the enemy, you get the chance to loot the enemy and go onto the next stage. This continues intill you die I believe. The AI and the equipment they have gets better and better the more you progress. It's brilliant, and it is fun if you enjoy the way the game controls and how the combat system works.\n\nThe AI is brilliant...     during combat, but outside of combat, they can be really dumb. The enemies are set on a predetermined path, and if they aren't, they will just stand there, and do nothing. Another problem with the AI, and this also affects the AI during combat, is the fact that they CAN'T OPEN DOORS. If the door is completly shut, they can't get through.\n\nThe game looks pretty good. The textures appear to be high res and the lighting is quite good. The dark and creepy art direction is brilliant and the atmosphere is just perfect as it set's the mood brilliantly about the dangers you will be facing. Not much else to say again, so let's move on.\n\nNow let's get to the main problem of the game and why I don't recommend you pick it up yet is the controls. I would love to play and experiment with the games combat if it weren't for the fact that the game controls like ♥♥♥♥ and are extremely confusing. You feel like a tank. I know they're trying to focus on the fact that you are heavy, but it is not needed to the extent this game goes to. Half of the time I just walk strait into the enemy, preventing us both from swinging our weapons. I just want there to be a lock on system, since the game focuses on 1v1, where you press A and D to circle around your opponent, and W and S you move closer and futher from you opponent. But instead, it feels like I'm controlling a character from Resident Evil 1. I hope they do add a lock on system. If there is one already in the game, I can't find it. This problem breaks the game for me\n\nHere is a short list on what I like, what I was indifferent to, and what I disliked\n\nPros:\n\n+Combat\n\n+Graphics\n\n+atmosphere and art direction\n\n+level design\n\n+Enemy AI during combat\n\n+Arena\n\nIndifferent:\n\n+/- The game not telling you anything, including how to play.\n\n+/- The enemy AI outside of combat.\n\nDislikes:\n\n- The Controls\n\n- Enemy AI doesn't know how to open doors.\n\nOverall, I want to love this game, I really do, but the awful controls in my opinion just destroy this game for me.\n\n5/10\n\nSorry for any mistakes in the review.

Moving around, just walking down a hallway is a chore. you get stuck on every little thing and world object, your character will trip (literally faceplant) very often trying to get through doorways. and this is very frustrating during combat when your tripping and getting stuck on the 100 physics based objects on the map. the game also suffers from sticky walls. touching a wall can very easily get you stuck untill you can wiggle out, which is game ending when in combat. pretty much moving around in the game feels like QWOP drunk. It is still a good game and i still recommend it\n\n7/10\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scMcTbq7qLY&feature=youtu.be","April 29, 2015","true","4.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Patience in combat is key in order to time your attacks in your opponents openings.  Before going into the main game, I highly suggest going through the arena for a while.\n\nSpace key is important in order to reorient your camera in the direction to where you character is facing while in combat, the arrow pointer is more or less where your character's facing is "Target Locked" onto.\n\nThis is will be a juggling act on your keyboard to maintain camera focus on your opponent, a somewhat unnecessary hurdle if the character could target lock onto an opponent in my opinion.\n\nHowever I hear that target locking onto an opponent isn't going to be persued in the game, but considering what the arrow pointer is, I don't see how their combat system couldn't incorporate it as an optional feature.\n\nTarget lock in Dark Souls for instance could be turned on and off.  I imagine if ultilized in this game you could use the pointer to click on an opponent while in Combat Mode (Tab), and the camera will then lock onto it, auto correcting the character's facing towards the opponent.  Or, you could use the (~) key for instance and it'd select the nearest opponent to lock onto.  Turning off target lock could be simple as using the arrow key to click on the opponent again, or hitting the designated lock on button again, or a different key, like (1) for instance.\n\nNow onto the dungeon.  It's not random.  So everytime you die you'll be trekking the same places for the same spots for loot.  This can be tedious, but it is a Perma Death game.  There is plans for check points in a future update, but you will have to endure without them for now.\n\nI gave it a thumbs up, but honestly I would give it neither thumbs up, or down, in its current state it needs a bit more work, but I can see the potential of the game, and currently nothing in the market fills the niche that this does.","April 30, 2015","true","27.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

In the singleplayer your mission is to adventure through dungeons and loot and survive. Practice is waves of 1v1's that get's harder after each round Probaly the best to play, In arena you have a base and you can recruit fighters. It uses ragdoll physics and the combat is mostly done with swiping of your mouse and finding your own tactics rather than ''LMB TO STAB'' I wouldn't recommend this for people that want an easy experience, because it takes training and dedication.

Just holding in the LMB just makes you perform like a drunken, limp-wristed nancy. You'll be hitting people with your weapon haft, forehead, or who knows what else. You need to coordinate your step, swing timing, and mouse twitch to land that beautiful, blood spraying head crack on your poorly dressed, destitute opponent.\n\nI appreciate a game that is skill based rather than playtime grind based. Holding in a mouse button and pressing 1-9 doesn't appeal to me. Learing the coordination to manipulate WASD, click timing, and mouse movement is much more fun in my opinion.\n\nYou will be punished mid swing if you leave yourself open. You will be rewarded if you read your opponents swing and hit him as he overextends. This game has beautiful, addicting mechanics. You don't just control your character, you become one with your charcter, you are his eyes, arms, and legs. When I was a kid, I would move my arms and body while controlling my console characters on screen. Shruggin shoulders to get that extra "oomph" into a jump, tilting sideways to push my character a little further to clear a pit. I'm an old man now, and this game is the only game to make me do that as an adult!\n\nCons in my short playtime: Inventory and equipment is not very intuitive, you can't immediately tell what is equipped/overridden/unequipped. Interface can be a little clunky at times.\n\nTL;DR: easy to learn, difficult to master peasant beating simulator.  knock a guy over with a sledgehammer then trip over him/10","January 29","true","9.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Still getting a lot of playtime in its current unfinished state.\n\nThe combat and controls have a very real learning curve, but are immensely satisfying once mastered. For real, the combat is super addicting, and with the new chalenging arena mode, its a blast to play.\n\nStory mode is unfinished, and ive spent far more time in the arena than in the story dungeons, but I think they will become quite exciting once fully realized.\n\nMost importantly, as an early access title, is the progress the game is making. Updates come roughly once every couple months, but evey single update ive seen has been highly polished, introducing new concepts, in the form of attacks, armors, levels and whatnot in a way that smoothly and greatly enhances the game. These guys know what they're doing, the care and thought going into this game is apparent.\n\nBottom line, this is undoubtedly one of the finest EA titles currently on steam, and an absolute hidden gem.

The combat feels very realistic and fun, especially when you first time learn how to make an over head swing with a two handed hammer and slam it right on the enemy's skull! Not to mention watching enemies tripping on objects they don't notice and deal a killing blow before they get up. At start it was very hard to learn the movement of your character and it felt clumsy but after tens of deaths you'll get the hang of it (when they said "unforgiving" they really meant it). The exploration was also fun and interesting: throwing stuff here and there to see if anything is hidden and all the long hallways to walk and huge amount of doors to open and - of course - revealing the dark mysteries. I only encountered 1 bug which I found completely hillarious: I was just swinging around with the huge hammer when I tried to hit a box as hard as I could when suddenly my hand was stuck in it. I tried to shake it off but it only looked like I was just furiously swinging it. After a few minutes I managed to unstuck it by trying to run away from it.\n\nI found it disappointing when I realized that it was rather short but what to expect from an Early-Access game.

I've gotten extremely used to the standardized 'kill -> loot -> upgrade' mechanic that every dungeoning game seems to try and adapt in some way. The genre has begun to feel stale, to say the least.\n\nAnd oh boy is Exanima a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe combat is entirely controlled by an in-house physics engine. There are no "animations," only muscle contractions resulting in movement of the body. The progression of the game's visual fidelity over the past few years has impressed me, with Bare Mettle paying close attention to player critiques of both gameplay and visuals.\n\nMost exciting to me is the fact that this game is a preamble, a proof of concept if you will, for a much larger open world game that is still in development. Even MORE exciting is the eventual inclusion of low-latency multiplayer over LAN, which has at this point been confirmed by the developer.\n\nIf you're unsure about purchasing this game, I would visit their website and watch their videos. If the reviews on steam and screengrabs don't get you, the technical demonstrations sure will.\n\nLastly, please spend 4-6 hours in the practice arena before you leave a bad review.

You'll notice right away that your character moves like a drunk sloth at times and the combat can be a bit clunky, BUT once you get it down, it's actually a lot of fun and takes a bit of skill to get good at.\n\nExploring the dungeon and taking your time searching around is where this game shines.  The game is rogue-like in a sense, and if you're lucky enough to survive a "knockout", you'll have a second chance to pick yourself back up and tread lightly though the dungeon again (with what is left of your health).  The game also has an arena mode where you can fight and hire other characters to fight for you and it adds a bit more content for you to sink your teeth into as well.\n\nAll and all, If the trailer has you wondering what this game is all about, and you don't  mind risking your cash on an EA title, then give it a go!!\n\n***UPDATE***\n\nAfter doing a little more poking around, I've discovered that this game is actually a prelude to another game the devs are working on called 'Sui Generis'.  Examina takes place 20 years before the events of SG.  The only difference is this game is limited to the underworld dungeons of SG. Exanima is its own full game and should not be avoided because of SG.  SG looks even more amazing than Exanima and far more ambitious too!","April 4","true","27.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Get this game. Yes it takes some time to get used to, a lot more time to master.

Also the arena is the strongest point of the game IMO and the one getting the least work done on.\n\nIf I were the developer of this game I would focus all my efforts into turning it into a multiplayer arena fighting game with competitive (with ladder) and casual modes where you can make money after successful fights and get better gear.","December 16, 2015","true","114.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

Strangers will come into sight, and they may or may not attack. Sometimes you feel good enough about your fighting ability (after some frustrated learning) to open an attack, but you also know that one false swing could go very badly, so do you risk it now, or wait for a better opportunity or weapon, or more armor to yet be found or taken.\nNo save feature yet, but I do believe they will add a persistent growth system. You can start a game and play in the story line, where that is going I am unsure of, you start with a perplexing parchment in you inventory, and find more, but you don't know anything at all. Also they have an arena, and it does keep some of your stuff you looted, even if you die, havent tried if it keeps after a shut off.\nAlthough it does not have enough in it to be fully thumbed up yet, the simple fact of how much fun it is to play, where it seems to be going, and the physics use in the game makes it quite worth while as is now.\n","May 1, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Just about everything in the game operates according to basic physics. You can trip over boards, fall over after swinging your weapon too far, and so on. On the plus side, the game basically achieves its ambitious goals. On the down side, the controls lack a certain 'smoothness,' or 'finesse.' Trying this one out is not a waste of money, but make sure and read up on the control interface before attempting anything. Then you should give yourself at least an hour to get a good hang of the interface. The bottom line is that using true physics in an action game is a fantastic idea, but that this game represents a 'work in progress.'","May 14, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Once you get it down, of course. My biggest grip, my BIGGEST gripe about the game? The phyics based movement. I know, I know, physics based game. But when your characters walk like they're about to spew taco bell al over the floor, and doing these goofy unrealistic wild swings.. It detracts from the experience. I was hoping for something a little more.. Realistic. But, it's still in early access and could change for all I know! Even in its current state, it's a great game! All my hours are from buying the game in one sitting, and frankly that just doesn't happen for me anymore. If you're considering buying the game, just know this.

Once you get it down, of course. My biggest grip, my BIGGEST gripe about the game? The phyics based movement. I know, I know, physics based game. But when your characters walk like they're about to spew taco bell al over the floor, and doing these goofy unrealistic wild swings.. It detracts from the experience. I was hoping for something a little more.. Realistic. But, it's still in early access and could change for all I know! Even in its current state, it's a great game! All my hours are from buying the game in one sitting, and frankly that just doesn't happen for me anymore. If you're considering buying the game, just know this. It will anger you at first if you've a low tolerance for learning curves. The physics take time to understand and grow accustomed to. Also, keep in mind.. It's early access. While it's rare, stuttering, glitches and crashes do happen. All in all, it's a unique fighting style you don't see in very many games.

It was fun most of these hours, some were spent in agony in the earlier times when I was impatient and could not fight :). But for the majority the chapter was fun and I enjoyed the constant feeling of death, it kept me on edge.

I thought I was supposed to guide the tip of the sword or something, but the character drunkenly swings at his foe when simply clicking the mouse. The game has no tutorial level, or anything of that sort, so good luck figuring out key commands, no end goal, and no back story (though I suppose that's good for RP purposes).\n\nNow for the good part. This game really embodies that clauster-phobic, "what's behind the door", "I can't run fast enough" feel that I love about dungeon crawlers. Not to mention the art is really top-notch -- textures, menu, and 3D have all obviously been passionately created by people who know their stuff. The character creation is very efficient and gets you moving into the game itself quickly.\n\nWhile it's on sale, I'd recomend it to someone who's not easily frusterated (like me, that's why I still haven't finished it), and up for a challenge.\n\n-Red","June 14, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Ranged combat has not been implemented, there is no magic for the players yet (I have fought skeletons and some kind of hulking beast that obliterated me), and I would like to see some kind of coop mode.

Has a handful of bugs such as default clothing disapearing after death and weapon-hand getting stuck on the floor after a knock out making it impossible to move too far away from it (stretchy hand syndrome).\nOther than all that...love the difficulty. Love the weapon and layered cloth ratings. Love the mechanics even if the physics sometimes make it look like your character is in some very strong muscle-relaxers.\nAnother feature to make it even more realistic would be mandatory water and food consumption ala Fallout New Vegas.\n\nNot sure I like the death = hard restart feature. Its one thing to be challenging (dark souls) another to be intentionally frustrating (this game).

Just as difficult as the first time I picked up Demon's Souls.  The graphics, physics, and atmosphere are very, very well done.  This game is in my personal Top Fives of atmosphere.  The controls feel a little wonky because they are fixed and do not change with your character.  W always goes up even if you're facing down, S always goes down even if you're facing up etc etc.  That is my only complaint of the game.  I have not progressed far since it is difficult and you really need to learn it.  I can breeze through arena mode, but I don't make it very far in the story mode.  Every hit is never the same.  If you hit an enemy in the head and make them stumble, but you move a little too close to them to hit them again you might not have enough power to finish them off.  Every encounter feels like a mini-strategy game; different than the Soulsborne world but similar as well.  If you get easily frustrated than this game isn't for you.  You will fail, you will die, and you'll do it hundred times.  Very fun game.","May 9","true","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

If the combat system is important to you, then I'd advise you to consider the purchase of this game very carefully and watch a few combat videos. The other big issue I have is the lack of save options in the dungeon exploring mode. At the moment (checkpoint system apparently coming later) if you die you've got to start everything from the beginning again. The art style is excellent in my opinion though, and if you can find enjoyment in the combat system this would probably be the best isometric dungeon crawler you could buy.\n\nYou may or may not find the controls difficult to grasp, a few in the forums have complained about the controls. I personally figured them out in about 5 minutes and don't have an issue with them myself. Everything revolves around the mouse cursor:  in combat W moves you towards the mouse cursor, D away from it, and A/D rotate clockwise/counterclockwise around it. In explore mode you can right-click and hold to move towards the character. In combat mode a double left-click and hold will perform an overhead attack, a single click and hold on left/right side of your character will perform a left or right swing. Not pressing any mouse buttons and aiming your cursor roughly in the direction of an opponent's attack will make your character try to block it.\n\nI don't like the combat for a few reasons. Overall, everything is somewhat slow and there is a sense that your character is drunk. Movement follows a "step, slight pause, step" pattern and I feel it could be much more fluid. Swings have big windups and are also a little slow. The blocking feels too automatic - all you have to do is release your attack keys and aim in the general direction of the opponents incoming swing. If the pace of combat were faster this might be an okay system, but incoming attacks are very easy to react to so there doesn't seem to be much skill involved in blocking.\n\nPhysics is calculated on the way you move and your swings and this does result in some neat features. You can use your movement to add force to your swings. The part of the weapon that hits you also matters, so you could step into the swing of a pole weapon (like a halberd) to avoid getting hit with the bladed part of the weapon and instead get hit by the pole, taking reduced damage. If you step into your opponent's swing right as he's winding up you can prevent him from being able to complete the swing. It's also possible for you (or opponents) to actually trip and fall over objects on the dungeon floor. However, if having these physics means keeping the drunken like movements and slow combat, then I think the game could've done without the physics. If you don't mind slower paced combat (and possibly difficult controls) and like what the physics adds then I think this game is potentially worth purchasing.\n\n","May 9, 2015","false","19.3"," 42 of 86 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","42","86","0","0"

Great. Concept? Intriguing. Challenge? Difficult but not in a good way. The camera set up is not a good one and having the direction input constantly changing because the camera can't stay still and constantly needs to be reset with the space bar is not a good thing. Challenging game play is one thing, i can accept the increased difficulty from the physics and hit detection, but the ai, which was programmed very nicely, will decimate you not because you didn't swing at the right time but rather cause your character constantly needs the camera re-positioned. Perhaps have the camera always facing behind the character unless we toggle it off otherwise,  or maybe add a lock on system and dodge so that the constant slow hobble that is the player's combat movement doesn't hinder us. The ai can sprint, turn and ignore the need for a camera while in battle. The player cannot. Improvements in this vital area would more than change my current opinion of this game.","May 28, 2015","false","4.0"," 62 of 127 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","62","127","2","7"

From a distance, it looks like the first game in a new generation of roguelikes, with actual graphics and an exciting physics-based combat system that makes beating someone to death with a hammer feel like beating someone to death with a hammer rather than clicking on a 3D model until its health bar disappears. However, it has a fatal flaw: the combat system is broken.\n\nTrying to control your character in combat is like trying to use keyboard to drive an actual dump truck. To swing your weapon, your choices are a slow right-to-left swing, a slow backhand left-to-right swing that doesn't register 70% of the time, and a very slow overhand haymaker that is impossible to aim and is useless if you want to stay alive for long. I suspect that there's no option to thrust your weapon because, like real life, that would be by far the most effective choice. Characters move with an unrealistic lack of urgency, making it impossible to quickly step out of an attack or into a blow. Worst of all, there's no player input for defending, which is the most important part of real fighting. Your character simply does it passively whenever you're not attacking. Often you will be perfectly positioned to stop a slow overhead strike, and still end up watching your oppenent's hammer slide off your shield and right into your head, killing you instantly. All of this clumsy design muddles fighting into something more like a roulette wheel you can tilt in your favor rather than a system you can master.\n\nAs it currently exists, Exanima is less like a game and more like a toy. You will die many frustrating deaths, sometimes because of a mistake you made that you can learn from, but mostly for reasons outside of your control. This is bad design. If you buy Exanima, buy it because you want to hit a zombie in the face with a machete and are OK with dying a lot for arbitrary reasons. If you don't think you'd like that, I can't recommend it.","September 17, 2015","false","8.7"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","13","28","0","2"

But I am pretty intuative when it comes to controls and clearly know the difference between "tactical" and clunky. The controls are not complicated, they need improvement and work. In concept they work pretty decent in arena mode because there is nothing to hinder the movent of your character and you're not fighting the camera as much. That is a key point to the problems of the controls, you are figthing the camera the entire time. Basically your character targets where your cursor is and wasd translates to your orientation to that point. So imagine dark souls if you had to constantly target with one joystick, control the character with another, then you need a third joystick to control the camera. The gameplay does not translate to the narrow corridors of the story mode because your trying to avoid objects (cause your character will stick to them) and maintain visibility of your character (where the third joystick comes into play). You get past that and the combat is actually pretty simple, imagine boxing. There is auto parry so you only need keep your character in the direction of the enemy. You can cancel their attacks by moving in close to impede on there ability to swing. Its just the camera and getting stuck in the tight enviroment. I believe the developers need to not kid themselves that the controls cleary need to be worked on rather than saying they are "tactical" and "complicated." I really wanted to enjoy this game because I enjoy combat that actually has wieghted physics to the character.\n\nSo as of 5/9, I cannot reccomend this game.","May 9, 2015","false","4.9"," 38 of 79 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","38","79","0","1"

Combat is a bit tighter.  Not in any revolutionary way, but there's somewhat less delay between player input and your character actually doing something on the screen.\n\n2.)  The camera is much friendlier in the Arena.\n\n3.)  Damage now seems more consistent with what you're seeing on the screen.  (Meaning: really nasty-looking cuts or blows now appear to actually cause nasty levels of damage.)\n\n\nCons:\n\n1.)  Blocking is still woefully broken.  Sometimes, blocking works as intended, sometimes the enemy's weapon just passes right through your own.  Blocking should work 100% of the time, like it does for the AI.\n\n2.)  Occasionally, you get spun around or knocked down for ridiculous reasons, like having your swing blocked.  Then, 99% of the time, you turn the wrong way to face the cursor, exposing your back, and there is nothing the player can do to prevent this.  This really needs to be fixed.\n\n3.)  Enemy "bosses" now get instant reaction times and swing their weapons twice as fast as you can while taking triple the damage!  How exciting, original, and balanced...\n\n4.)  Probably as a side effect of the physics being tightened up, weapons and ragdolls have much more "dead" weight.  You used to kill an enemy and send them sprawling.

Not only because the developers are very creative with their puzzles, but also because combat is... well, combat.\nIt's hard, you're not some elegant fencer, heck no. You're a jack of all trades, master of none.\n\nSure, you can use any weapon you want. It's not a guarantee that you'll be good at it. Players actually need to find the weapon combination that fits them specifically.\nThe map is like a maze as well, and instructions are still somewhat unclear. when it comes to the world itself, and the enemies will sometimes block the doors so you can't get back out, especially if they are hunting you.\n\nBut all that aside. Once you finally learn to fight in this game, it's actually pretty fun, but rest assured. the road to learning combat in this game, is a rather rough one... You'll get frustrated and angry multiple times.\n\nAlso, It seems that this game will have some pretty deep rpg elements, like levels. I'm looking forward to it.\n\nThough I have one thing to add;\n\nHP.\nIn this game, hp is probably the most treasured thing. You can take permanent damage... And it's really hard to regen it in the story mode. (as far as I know, it's only through one specific item)\n\nHoping we will see other means of regenerating permanent damage, not that such a method should come easily. I'm thinking through meditation (seems to be a skill tree that the devs are working on)\nMaybe the higher tiers would allow you to slowly regenerate permanent damage when out of combat, and not running.\n\nFor now, i'm recommending this game, even at full price, and it's a must play for gamers looking for a unique and hard combat system.\n\nBut don't tell me I didn't warn you. This game. is TOUGH!","May 2, 2015","true","33.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Firstly, a hardcore anorak developer who does not want players to be able to 'save early, save often' choosing instead for rage quitting perma-death (console style checkpoint system has been implented apparently, though I never got that far).\n\nSecondly, the combat is not really conducive to narrow passage ways, and if the game is worth buying, it's only worth it for the practice arenas, where you get to perfect the aforementioned excellent Combat Physics - this isn't animated combat, it's physics! Stumble, fall, swing wildly and collide with your opponent for victory. A victory which never felt this good before in any sword wielding game I've ever played.\n\nKeep an eye out for Sui Generis, by the same developer, which will provide more open area for fighting and alleviate at least one of my concerns. Either way, two thumbs up and yes, it's worth a buy, if only for the Practice Arena.\n\n9/10 (minus 1 point for the anorak)","November 27, 2015","true","15.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","3"

No. It's a perma-death, losing all your gear, your progress, your everything. And that makes the game nice in a way, but also VERY boring. It's boring to progress a game for like half an hour, and after a couple of failed swings you have to start all over again.

I really wanted to like this game.  However, after figuring out how the combat system works, all I can say is that I am very underwhelmed.\n\nMy main gripes are as follows.\n\nYour character swings every weapon like a drunk, blocking is NOT manual, and there is no way to attack other than swing wildly.  I'm not sure how having a character that automatically swings all his weapons into chairs and tables  or one that doesn't even attempt to block most attacks is realistic...\n\nEnemies stare at you for a few seconds, then attack you.  There is no chance for interaction.  When I read the description for the game this is one of the features I was excited about, yet not one I saw any evidence of.\n\nI might come back and try this game after it is more complete, however as it is right now, the combat is simply far to clunky, boring, and unrealistic.","June 14, 2015","false","0.3"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","11","25","0","0"

Controls are frustrating to say the least. Camera control makes it worse. Combat is near impossible especially with no tutorial to help explain how in the world to do anything, especially when you have to keep adjusting the camera mid-fight to face the right direction and you constantly sidestep in the wrong direction because that's just how the controls are setup. I get that it's 'physics based' combat and this game has props from me for trying something new, but for now, I think it's being executed poorly. Got frustrated at it and quit in less than an hour. I believe I said the words 'This is a terrible game' while playing. If you're looking for a new RPG/Dungeon Crawler/Hack n Slash: look elsewhere. At least until more work is done on this game and it gets improved. Overall it does look good and the devs are trying something new with physics based combat, but I think they need to work on the combat more to make it enjoyable. As for now, I cannot reccommend this game. If the controls get improved so you can actually see where youre going and defend yourself successfuly, then I might reccommend it. For now though, wait on buying this until it's out of EA.\n\nPlayed it some more after writing this review. I got further and enjoyed it a bit more, but the character controls and camera controls are still really annoying and wonky. It is a good game. The graphics look good, the lighting and shadows are really good, but I think the controls suffer and the physics system needs more work. This makes the game retain the 'not recommended' vote at least until the controls get updated.","September 16, 2015","false","2.0"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","2"

Would I recommend it to someone else short answer no.\n\nThe combat is interesting and different and the Arena mode is good fun, the AI is also very good and does a fine job of being challenging but not unfair.\n\nThe problems start in the single player campaign game. The lack of save points is a real issue, I have had a look around and I understand the arguments against them, however adding in different difficulty modes would change nothing for hard core players and would lower the barrier for entry for other people with less time.\n\nThe loot system is random so some times I get nice armour others nothing of much use, this can be irritating in a game where you are expected to replay levels over and over. I feel like the loot should be fixed. This is how every other element of the game work so why chests are random makes no sense.\n\nDue the the amount you will have to replay sections of the game while learning much of the immersion and atmosphere are lost, while permanent death dose make the game tense a lot of that tension is lost when you know the exact layout of the levels and the enemies in them. In many ways this seems a strange choice as the initial play troughs are great fun but quickly turn frustrating or just boring.\n\nAt the moment this is only a game for the hard core player, I don’t think its a bad game but I do think it has an extremely limited audience in its current form. I would say to anyone think very carefully about how much time you have lean to play. Also think about how much repetition in a game you are comfortable with.

But for a complex system it's too simple. Let me expand on that. In order to block you move the mouse in a way that will move your weapon to stop the force of the opponents blow, but in combat mode you always face the direction your mouse is, so you end up spinning around, unable to strike on your open opponent. You also have to manually track the target to keep facing towards them, again based on where your mouse is pointing.\n\nMovement with the WASD isn't so bad to get used to but it feels so unresponsive and your character will randomly stop moving then start again. Walking around with the torch in the dar kdungeons and exploring and using the physics engine is great. But the combat (which most of this game is) is just not fun. It's not fun to learn and it's not fun to do.\n\nHopefully it will be improved upon to make it more user friendly because if they don't, no-one except the hardcore fans are gonna want to play.","April 30, 2015","false","0.8"," 26 of 56 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","26","56","0","2"

Should take anywhere from a hour to a couple for almost anyone to complete the Arenas.\n\nIt is not that the combat or game is really hard, its simply different.  They reinvented the wheel for combat so its a learning process and not just learning what to do... but learning how to actually be competent with the controls.  Ever play Surgeon Simulator? Its like that, in that it has its own semi unique control scheme which forces players to learn something they have never done.  It also while fun for a bit is far from perfect...(explain more farther down)\n\nWhy did I buy the game? I was on the fence for a while and recently watched a stream play through the campaign (Its not really much of a campaign... its like a modern version of a reallly old dungeon game... none of the standard fair is there... No MAP, no inventory management, no dialogue, honestly not much of anything...) Its a giant maze that you just wonder around in fighting.  Hoping you dont trip over something, if your not paying attention you will forget there is even a sort of back story going on.  So with having previewed the campaign I just wanted to test my mettle against the "combat system" and see the hype and hate about it first hand and see if I could master it or not.\n\nBack to the Combat... For a game that hypes the combat so much, there are things that bother me... Weight seems not to have much a impact on movement.  I mean it feels the same in no armor or full plate, you would think you would feel faster or more agile in leathers/cloth? Nope... Fluidity&movement feels the same regardless.  Weapons do have a major impacts vs armor however and you feel that to some extent. My biggest issue is the blocking system... Its automatic... So we go through this entire re-learning how to play a game and one of the biggest aspects blocking is done by itself? The blocking mechanics just kind of bother me and after a while once you master the controls and understand combat, its what you spend half your time doing.  Easy fights you dont care just kill, the more difficult ones, its a game of patience and not skill, feint or block waiting for a opening then counter attacking. Once you have that down, its all just rinse and repeat regardless of the situation or fight.\n\nAny of the long reviews good or bad pretty much spot on about the game... Its a game for people who like Pain... those who choose the "HardCore" setting.  Those who feel good about playing a "hard game".  Personally I wont play it again other then to randomly play through the Arena every now and then, why? Because this game is not something you can put down and come back to later and be proficient at, the controls and playstyle means any length of time away from the game, and you will be back at square one and having to spend another hour or two honing your skills back in the Arena.\n\nAlso... Lets be honest this game is made simply to generate cash so the Developer can finish the kickstarter game they started on back in 2012.  This is not a bad thing... for the people who have been waiting I would be concerned but the backers are all playing Alpha of that game and got a copy of this for free.  For everyone else, its a way to support a Developer that is making a unique game with unique gameplay, and rather you end up liking the game or not, you donated a couple dollars to support something different. Do not expect this game to really develop much farther...  I dont expect it will, as the revenue from this will go into thier primary game.\n\nI can not recommend it as I guess I am just not that hardcore anymore... I want my maps... my options to save, combat that does not reinvent the wheel,  a reason /purpose to adventure.  While interesting I just did not see much depth here, awesome in theory and even a lil cool to see, but do I have a desire to come home after work tomorrow and play again? No.\n\nIf you do want to get it... if nothing else, playing through the Arenas until you beat them is worth the money, cant promise you will like it, but it will be a challenge.\n\n","December 7, 2015","false","5.3"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","5"

Exanima is difficult and tedious, and even when you play well, it feels unrewarding. The combat system was promising, but unreliable - for example, even when blocking in the direction of an incoming attack, you sometimes take huge damage. The level design is repetitive and unintuitive; its very difficult to find your way around because everything looks the same. I'd give a 2/5 - has some promise and interesting ideas, but not enough to make me want to keep playing.","January 29","false","2.9"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

I think it is good in its way. I like the setting and that developers decided to use general ideas of gameplay from Dark Souls (i guess), which is not that easy. But i don't like battle mechanincs so far, not in this way. I had to spend time and get killed like a hundred times to finally understand it. In general it is simple, you hold your sword by doing nothing and the player parries himself as long as you keep distance and in forward of the enemy. Once you've parried you hit him back. On at a time, or he will hit most likely hit you on your second click. And you do this until the enemy is dead. If you come across 2 enemies or more - you run away and try to kill them one by one. This is game's batle mechanics. Takes a lot of time to undestand and makes you feel stupid and bored once you did that.\nThe game has nice picture, but level design is too complicated. You can wander around for 2 hours to come across closed door, and than look for a little key for another 2 hours. I could make it futher than second level because i couldn't find one of those keys. Loot is boring as well, at least for now. You have to undress every item you have to compare it to the one you've found.\n\nPluses:\n- Nice graphics\n- Entourage Interaction\n- Interesting world design\n- Optimization\n\nMinuses:\n- Blank looking levels. I know that this is a setting, but orienting in these corridors is damn hard.\n- Very complicated level design\n- Every fight looks like a fight of drunk people\n- abolutely not intuative battle mechanics...\n\n... And the most important:\n- awfull awfull awfull controls!!! I hate them! Why can't you simply walk on wasd the direction you press? The importance of comfortable controls is undoubtedly very high! How can you expect this game to gain popularity among mass players with such awfull controls? Even Dark Souls knows that despite making gameplay hardcore you must give a player comfortable control scheme.

Seems i dont understand a purpose of it. In adventure mode you start in empty room and just go... That's pretty much the whole game. First levels same zombies, later same skeletons, at first it seems "wow so much interactions with objects", but in fact you dont need anything, just check "big chests" to get best items and move to "next level". For me this game seems the worst diablo without any purpose, but combat is kinda cool. Too bad zombies and skeletons extremely stupid, once you start to understand how to put weight in you slashes and overheads, and how to position yourself for different side atacks in enemies exposed weaknesses you will kill any encounter in 5 seconds. The arena is funnier in other hand. I think PvP would be cool in this game, for now it seems like "Test our combat, because game has nothing more to offer". Ill give it a credit of early access and recommend the game, the release has potential i guess.\n\nP.S. I also dont think this game a RPG, even classic crawlers at least have some background story, this is actually first game i see that doesnt have any foundament to your adventures.\n\nAnd for the purpose that this review doesnt feel completely "negative" ill add that combat in this game feels extremely satisfying the better you are at it. It's literally the game, where not your character gain expirience, but you. Starting as drunken hobo playstyle you can potentially grow into real tactican of this combat, where you can put down any emeny with one precised and well timed strong slash or overhead into exposed part, sending enemy off-balance and finish him on ground. It feels really good. Timing, weakness knowledge, master movement will for sure be entarteiment at least for some time and potentially at release.","February 3","true","22.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","1"

I really do. The physics engine, the realistic duels, the setting, graphics, tone. EVERYTHING! I want to like this game! The game reminds me of part Diablo, part Chivalry, and part Resident Evil. The fight engine, OMG I love the realistic physics based fight engine. It feels like a top down version of Chivalry realistic melee engine, constantly trying to block and parry to land a crippling blow BUT with the current controls and camera it is so hard to simply walk down a hallway without tripping much less have a coherent fight. It reminds me of controlling a string puppet the way it moves but the AI doesn't seem to have this handicap as it easily pursues you and counter attacks your character on every one of your uncoordinated swings. The controls are Resident Evil style Tank controls along with a rotating camera (If it was just a fixed camera or locked behind you it would be fine), W moves forward regardless the direction the camera is facing. As the camera rotates you feel as if you are fighting the camera as well as the enemy and it becomes so frustrating because when you die you feel like the game unjustly killed you, mixed with the lack of no saves or checkpoints it gets harder and harder to want to restart every time you die. I feel like they were trying to reinvent the wheel by replacing it with 4 concrete blocks.\n\nIn the end this is alpha, the controls flat suck and you only have two attacks swing and chop, no thrust yet even though its listed in stats. The game can still be great just not yet, maybe in the Beta.\n\nUpdate May 2016\n-----------------------\nI tried this game again so here are a few bullet points.\n*They added thrust, which is GREAT but always seems to miss to their left under their arm pit.\n*You still feel like your character is drunk as he stumbles into the enemy and sluggishly swings.\n*I feel no real "umph" when I land a blow, everything feels like a glancing blow.\n*According to the Devs the bad controls arn't a mistake, they are the point so get used to it or get out.\n\nThey say a sign of good game design is "easy to play hard to master", get ready to master just walking down hallways...\n\nI guess I'll see what happens in May 2017.","May 10, 2015","false","1.3"," 17 of 38 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","17","38","0","4"

Do not underestimate this aspect of the game.\n\n\nThis review is being edited now because when I first wrote it I was very frustrated by this game.  I say "very frustrated" because I'm lacking words to adequately describe how I was feeling.  I was frustrated because the game is so lovely to look at and to be in.  It was like opening presents at Christmas when you were a child.  I proper settled down to it and I was convinced I was going to enjoy this.  The setup was perfect and I couldn't believe my luck at finding this gem.  When my character woke up in the first room my expectations were met; I was set.  It is so obvious that the devs of this game have perfectly created their vision for the one thing that, just the very hope of, most immediately attracted me to their product:  Atmosphere.  This game oozes atmosphere.  And it isn't style over substance.  It's real atmosphere.  Measured, disciplined, detailed:  Atmosphere.   And it is gorgeous to behold.  The lighting engine, the minute attention to detail, the music, the props.  It is all fantastic.  You want to really immerse yourself in this.  Like a hot bath after being in the freezing cold all week.  But I couldn't.\n\nThe game is effectively impenetrable for myself.  A lot of people like this game, love it in fact.  The Devs have a very loyal fan base, and deservedly so.  Like I say:  The care and attention to detail in the very, very small part of this world that I've been able to see is very attractive.\n\nI should have stayed in that first room and not opened the door.\n\nThe combat in this game is not intuitive.  I know they state that on the product page, but you think to yourself you'll give it a whirl, "how bad can it be?".  But I mean this is really unintuitive, you may not be able to enjoy it, you may not be able to do it at all, and then you effectively can do nothing in the game.  This is a negative review because you could buy this and basically not be able to use the product.  Like me.  This game was a waste of money for myself.  Other people obviously love it.  I can't get down the first corridor.\n\nThe combat is physics based.  And I hate it.  Momentum, inverse kinematics, collision detection.  It's all in there.  A technological marvel really.  There is some very clever mathematics going on here.  But you'd expect that. . .  It's in keeping with the beautiful attention to detail in the rest of the game. . . I would expect to see a Game Programming Gems article from one of the Devs at some point in the future.  And it's very polished.  It's slick in fact.  It should be everything you ever wanted.\n\nWhat this physics manifests itself as though is a very unresponsive interface.  You want to swing your weapon, and time passes, and then you sort of swing half heartedly.  It's awkward.  You might swing your sword as your body turns into it and the blade sort of just doesn't swing.  It's unsatisfying to play as I know that in real life I can swing a bat.  When you walk there is no strafe, so you slide down the corridor walls then fall over something, or you correct this with A or D but turn too much and you walk like a drunk, over-correcting in an uncoordinated way, winding way.  Fighting exacerbates this.  Combat feels like you are exhausted and disorientated.  You can't just do what you want your avatar to do.\n\nNever have I thought I'd do better if me, myself, replaced my computer game avatar.  I found myself literally screaming at my monitor for my character to do. . . just something. . . To walk in a straight line. . to swing a weapon without falling over.  To hit just something, anything.  To do something when I pressed the button for that action to be carried out.  It wouldn't be so bad if the delay was predictable.\n\nIt was this combat that was the worst part for myself.  I was almost 6 hours in and I’d never won a fight at the point I wrote the review.  I did win one fight after I wrote the first review.  I'd stopped playing the dungeon part of the game and was doing the arena part.  It didn't feel satisfying to win, I was just surprised, I got lucky.  Not really sure what I did differently.\n\nIt's got character movement and impact physics, in combat, a bit like Die By the Sword.  That game was played for laughs and didn't offer much.  You don't exactly quite control the sword swings in this game.  It's got a lot of Mount and Blade in it too.  But whereas Mount and Blade's combat felt connected and solid and immediate - this is just detached feeling - like I saw it's just not responsive.  Mount and Blade’s game play was difficult to learn.  This game's game play is obviously difficult to learn too.  But I feel Mount and Blade benefited from being in the third person.\n\nAs I stagger and fall over all the time playing this game it starts to feel more like Sumotori Dreams crossed with gang beasts.  I felt my character was pathetically weak, and almost an unconscious drunk just staggering around a dungeon.  I would slowly waggle your weapon in front of myself, staggering two steps at a time away from, towards, around, maybe a bit more away from, then trip and fall over.  My feet were always uncoordinated for my attack.  And although you auto parry, so does the enemy, and sooner or later you'll get hit as you misjudge when you can try a strike.\n\nBecause of the physics, momentum, there is no immediacy to your actions and I guess you need to play the game a few milliseconds into the future, because you need to overcome inertia before you can start to do the thing you wanted to do, (but isn't a good idea anymore), a few moments ago.\n\nAlso.  I didn't find continuing to bang my head against a wall to be worthwhile because:  There is no save.  There never will be either based upon the community feedback on this feature.  It’d be like starting Dragon Age Origins or Dark Souls, and having to complete the entire game in one sitting.  You can't come back to it as every time you die you have to start from the very beginning and retread the same content as before.  Over and over again.  It isn't procedurally generated.\n\nAt this stage I'd love someone to tell me the cheat code - so I could at least just enjoy walking around the beautiful world in god mode.  Please will a Dev give me the console command?  I want to see what's at the end of the corridor - I gave you my ten quid - I just can't care about the combat anymore. . .\n\nThe community were helpful when I asked for help.  It made no difference.  The game is just fundamentally impenetrable.  For me at least.\n\nBut the community and the Devs might want to think about this.  As much as this is your game.  And it's how you want it. . . . . .  And you are very protective of it. . . .  What proportion of gamers are going to be prepared to spend hours before they kill their first enemy, do you think?  When that first kill doesn't even feel like an achievement?  When it felt like luck?  What proportion? .  Dark Souls is hard.  But most people can get some satisfaction and progress in that. . Enough to keep them going.  PvP in EVE online is hard, but you at least know what happened when you die.  You at least can relate your actions to the result. . . .  Is your learning curve too high?  Can everyone actually enjoy your game?  Or is this product essentially useless to some people, like myself, bearing in mind Steam doesn't do refunds?   Are you going to address this in anyway?","May 23, 2015","false","5.4"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","13","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/falloutgod13/recommended/362490/","falloutgod13","falloutgod13","http://steamcommunity.com/id/falloutgod13/","318 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'm writing this as I go.\n\n+ First look, it's impressive, the graphics are surprisingly good.\n\n- Lack of tutorial, but there is a lengthy quick guide. It just wasn't helpful in helping me learn the mechanics of combat or how to interact with objects. That came mostly from trial and error, mostly error and death.\n\n- NO ADJUSTABLE DIFFICULTY: This is a huge negative right now. I suppose they can always add it later because I'm not one to enjoy learning a quirky combat system the hard way, just to play an indy game with quirky combat no one really understands except for the dev team, and maybe people who've been following the game development.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, my patience went from full to zero fast. Instead of destroying my keyboard I downloaded a trainer from a trusted source and proceeded to explore. :/ I wish there was an easier difficulty for n00bs. So take note of that before buying. This game is hard and combat isn't easily mastered. Think of Dark Souls, but with you constantly tripping over crap in the environment and falling on your face while a zombie rapes your butt with a handsaw, true story.\n\n+ Very immersive and dark environment. I want the lead level designer to be my interior decorator, it's like being inside one of my nightmares, confusing, dank, dark, and all around creepy.\n\n+ Surprisingly large amount of layerable armor. Right now I have on Leather boots, leather pants, shirt, leather jerkin, leather cap, leather gloves, and leather vambraces. Bassically I'm ready to go to a BDSM convention. I'm just walking around carrying a barrel lid as a makeshift shield and a bloody wood axe as my weapon of choice. Considering I started with pants, shoes, and a shirt, this feels like a huge improvement.\n\n- Despite supposedly being a way to make friends and gain trust among the shambling corpse like beings I've encountered, I haven't seemed to manage it. Perhaps I'm just too tasty looking? I don't know, everything seems to walk up to me, stare, then take a swing at me. A tutorial would seriously help.\n\n- While the concept for the combat is great, I'm really struggling with the controls. They just aren't very intuitive. It's like trying to learn to ride a bike with the steering reversed. Yeah, it's pretty bad, and they don't seem to be contextually sensitive so the response isn't always what you'd expect, but rather in relation to either the pointer, or which way the character is facing. The controls get a 1 out 10 from me. Seriously, cool idea, terrible experience. Another reason why it is not n00b friendly, aside from lacking in adjustable difficulty.\n\n- No save file system. Why? I don't know, probably some lame tripe about it being more "hardcore" or some crap. If that's seriously the dev team idea of fun, then they need a reality check. If you want iron man mode you can add it as an option. The rest of us have crap to do. Like feed our 9 foot python our neighbor’s annoying yuppie chihuahua. Then wait behind the bushes on Monday morning to chase the mailman with a machete, because he didn't leave you a note about that package that was waiting for your at the post office for over a month before being shipped back to the dealer, well... and he could use the exercise. Point is, the game needs a damn save system.\n\n*While you can smack things, and trip over them, there is one thing you can’t seem to do. Destroy things, yup, you can’t smash stuff. Which for a game that’s supposed to be all about realistic physics and stuff it kinda breaks the immersion. I was really expecting that locked door to splinter apart. 50 axe hits later it sunk in that I was expecting too much. I had the same result with barrels and crates, and pretty much everything else.\n\n- No map!!! Aside from the cool atmosphere it’s pretty much a maze of very similar rooms. Writing a review has me lost. A compass would be nice too. Maybe I can find these things? I’ve yet to find some wine and cheese though so I’m not too optimistic about my prospects.\n\n+ A compass can be found! :D Except I’m still lost without a map. Maybe I can find a crayon set and some paper?\n\n- Items like keys aren’t marked, and easily blend into where ever they are located. I ran in circles for 20 minutes and eventually had to look up a guide to find the first two keys. Luckily they seem to be in static locations, unless on enemies. Can we get a highlight interactive items key? FFS That’s 20 minutes of my life I could have spent washing my crotch, trimming my nose hair, or cleaning my bathroom floor tile crevices with a toothbrush like a strung out tweaker!\n\n- Took me a minute to figure out how to use the keys. I thought I could just insert them into the doors, seemed reasonable as I was able to rotate them as I dragged the keys around. NOPE. Click key, get weird reticle, click door. *facepalm* Ever hear of tooltips? Because the dev team clearly hasn’t. -_- What are we in 1986?\n\nTO  CONCLUDE\n\nI wanted to like this game. It’s beautiful, very nice graphics and level design. However, that’s simply not enough to excuse the terrible experience it delivers. The entire control system needs an overhaul, so does the GUI, especially whatever passes for a HUD. There’s also the need for adjustable difficulty and save file management. I would say it needs more polish, but it’s one glossy turd at the moment. That being said, it’s still a turd. It was funny at first how I could trip over the corner of the wall(how? did my character decide to parkour?) or how my arm would get stuck behind a doorway or corner… but after the 100th time I was far from amused. As nice as it looks, it’s far from anything that could remotely be considered a finished product. I’m giving it a thumbs down, as I don’t recommend it at this point. I’m hoping the finished product will be as fun to play as it is to look at. At the moment it feels like having a hot bossy girlfriend, looks great, but how long can you put up with that?","July 21, 2015","false","8.5"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","18"
