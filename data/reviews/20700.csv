A classic indie game that deserves a whole lot more attention and love than it got.\n\nStarts off a bit slow with a bit too much dialog I'll admit, but give it time and be patient, and after a while it becomes a really addictive and fast paced action/strategy game. It's like, if Asteroids had an open-ish map where while you're fighting stuff and mining resources in one location, the enemies are doing the same in other locations and taking away your potential resources to build better ships and guns and stuff.\n\nAlso, the character art looks like something from deviantART. However, the ships and gameplay graphics look great! It has aged fairly well (but be warned that the max resolution is 800x600 with no widescreen modes!!)\n\nMore people need to know about this game. So... go play it or somethin'!","November 2, 2014","true","2.4"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

I bought it about five years ago from a non-Steam service and promptly lost the ability to play it.  I saw it up on a flash sale and promptly bought it.  It is a testament to the game that it's imagery stayed prominent for so long with me.  Either way, the game is SPAZ before SPAZ existed.  Do not buy it expecting the same polish from a game with a decade of tech advancement inbetween.  That said, it's a fun romp through space mining resoruces, builing tech and blasting aliens.\nStory is shaping up decent for the first hour of game too.

You can explore the Universe, fight through thousands of various enemy units, research new technologies, build a lot of stuff and experience the storyline, something that 4X games usually lack. The music is awesome, too.\nHowever, the storyline itself is somewhat shallow, character depth is nonexistent, and the game only runs at 640x480 and 800x600, forcing you to play in Windowed mode, if you have a 16:9 monitor.\nOverall, it's a great game, which I played for around 30 hours outside of Steam, and 13 more hours here. It's not worth the full price of 10 dollars/euros, because it's outdated, but you should definitely grab it during the sale.","October 11, 2014","true","13.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlmazD/recommended/20700/","AlmazD","Alm√°z","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlmazD/","180 products in account","This is actually a really fun game at first, when you are first upgrading and manipulating your ship.  You can make missile boats, blaster-based ships, you get option drones to fire when you shoot, and so on.  Mining is actually somewhat interesting to fool around with early on.\n\nIt, however, gets repetitive, starting with mining, and then upgrading, and finally the combat.  The final ship components cause all end-game ships to look the same, and the final boss has a stupid mechanic which requires you to either have a way more responsive ship than the game gives you, or to angle a shot in a way that gives you a generally unsatisfying win because you didn't do the high-agility maneuvers that it feels like you should do.  It caps the game off with not even allowing you to have a solid victory in the final "cutscene."\n\nOverall, a good 75% of a game marred by an overly repetitive final zone.  If you don't mind this, and the late 90s graphics, go ahead and get it!  It's actually pretty fun, reminiscent of Asteroids with an upgradeable ship and uh, better graphics, though still a far cry from anything you'd call "modern."","July 30, 2014","false","19.3"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

The arcade component is in total domination, but as long as it is not backed by strategic advancements, it tends to become overwhelmingly hard.\n\nThe main feature of the game is addictive gameplay. Despite the simple idea ("collect resources to become stronger, but watch your back and take offensive actions to collect intelligence") the gameplay is extremely immersive. The whole stroy takes ~12 hours (or less on low difficulty levels) to complete. The storyline is not bad, but not too bristling with events.\n\nFrom purely technical point of view, the game mechanics is trivial: the more resources you collect, the more powerful you get; and few things can prevent you from collecting resources. Whenever you save a game, it is always easy to load and avoid any serious danger you get into. It is possible to think of circumstances resulting in 100% death, but I have never encountered such a coincidence in practice. The only thing the enemies can do is substantially delay your advance.\n\nSUMMARY: plot is simple, but intriguing, graphics is nice, strategy is straightforward. But there is something in this game that makes it addictive and immersive. An insight into this game is highly recommended. Slightly overpriced (for a reason).","March 23, 2015","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Collect resources, upgrade your mothership and your fightercraft, research and build...but the mechanics don't come together, it feels shallow, the interface is a pain, and it doesn't do bigger than 800x600.  The concept isn't flawed, it's just too small: the mechanics would have been fine in a shorter game, a flash game, that kind of thing, but stretched out to full-game length it suffers.  This game doesn't need a strategic map, but you have to slog through it anyway.  Worst of all is that it caps what you're allowed to research pretty aggressively, so early in the game you're sitting on max levels of resources that you can't spend.  Way to identify the fun part of the game and then kick it like a puppy, guys.\n\nI still have fond memories of this game though, mainly from one night when I heard the starbase alarm going off, said "Hey wait my mothership is still at full health", and realized it was my next door neighbor playing at full volume.\n\nVerdict:  Go play Tyrian instead.

Nice.\n\nPhysics based handling? Not bad.\n\nUpgradable ship designs? Pretty good!\n\nLots of semi-interesting characters with a less than vomit-inducing plot? Not great, but it could be worse.\n\nSo... what's not to love? Why's this a thumbs down vote?\n\nWell... here's the rub: the handling on your ships is very realistic, but it's slow and clunky. I'm alright with that, normally. It requires some planning of momentum and some good piloting to be competent, and that's fine.\n\nThe problem is that the boss battles aren't designed for the controls nor the physics of the game. They assume perfect, pristine, pin-point keyboard turning in rapid order. I'm fine with that if the interface made such a realistic possibility. Unfortunately, starscape's boss battles are like waltzing into the olympics' figure skating event wearing cross country skiis.\n\nIt doesn't matter how good you are, the controls simply flat out SUCK for trying to fight the bosses, and player skill seriously only has a very small amount to do with it. Someone with godlike reflexes could theoretically get through in a few tries, but most of your boss battles involve being expected to start moving out of the way before a boss even begins to box you in, without knowing when or where that attack will come from. If your ship were even remotely possible to be set up to cope with that, great, but it's not.\n\nKeyboard turning and physics-based thrust maneuvering simply doesn't work for the style of bosses that Starscape throws at you.\n\nThe rest of the game is fun and fine, a few minor nitpicks here and there, but it's good overall... but the act-ending bosses are mandatory, and they suck HARD. I don't mean "it's difficult", I mean it in the sense of "this is one of the worst design decisions I've ever seen anyone ever make... did they even play test this to see if it was fun?".\n\nAny fun you get from the game will be sucked dry as soon as you're stuck in a boss battle, and since the controls and interface flat out aren't up to the task of fighting the bosses, it's going to make you pull your hair out over it. I highly advise staying the hell away from Starscape just in general. Unless you're a masochist, then go right ahead.\n\nAnyway, to stress it again, there's a difference between "difficult" and "bad design and poor UI/controls". Having a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• poor interface does not equate to "difficulty", it just equates to being BAD.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nNot worth it, even if it's on sale for $1. You'll probably break a keyboard that cost more than $1, even if you don't have a history of such, and are a pretty mellow person normally. While the game has lots of really good points to it, and does a lot of stuff very well, it's flaws are gamebreaking. When you put more effort into fighting the game's interface than you do fighting the boss, the game's a bust.\n\n\nScore: About 35%. It has some really good stuff, but the flaws are devastating and overpower any potential the game had.","January 29, 2012","false","6.8"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","1"

The game has nice mechanics, but it is repetitive. The story could be interesting, but somehow isn't really in the end.\n\nThere are only 2 things which really bother me about it.\n1: The resolution is limited to 800x600, which brings a lot of problems on newer hardware, and that resolution even bothered me way back then.\n\n2: There are achievements for finishing the game on Easy, Normal and Hard. As opposed to common sense, finishing hard does not give the other 2 achievements as well, so you'd need 3 playthroughs to get all achievements, which is ridiculous.\nIf someone has endgame saves for easy and normal, please take a look at the discussion section of this game, it'd be cool to have those 3 saves here so the achievements could be achieved properly.\n\nSo yeah, with those flaws and after all this time it's just not worth 10‚Ç¨ anymore.

You shoot asteroids to get resources (you need them to build parts or repair your fighter or base); all the while you're under attack by all sorts of enemy types.  You can research new parts -- fighter hulls, engines, shields, weapons, batteries -- which you then need resources to build.\n\nTime is paused while you are in your base station, so you can choose what manpower to allocate to research or building, and you can arrange parts onto fighter hulls to try new tactics.  However, stuff doesn't progress until you get back out into the action.  And don't take too much damage out there or you'll use up the resources you need for building new toys, and have to go get more.

To actually make stuff out of it, you have to do some R&D - research better stuff, then actually build it. Both actions take minerals, and there's only so many minerals per area. And they don't come back. Thankfully we have a dangerous zone with infinite resources. *gulp* Oh, and this will play on pretty much anything. Woo!","December 15, 2011","true","30.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Customize the weapons on the space station and have it back up your customized ship.  Only single player.  Tough learning curve on controls. You can see how the graphics are.  Well worth 5 bucks.  Ten? Maybe, if its your style.","October 7, 2011","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Enjoyable experience once through, not too sure about the replay value on it. Tutorial explains things reasonably well.\n\nHas so far proven to be somewhat unstable on winblows 7 though. Still works well enough, but it's prone to crashing more often than I'd like. Frequent saves rrecommended.","July 2, 2011","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This may be worth buying if you like flying a spaceship around, mining, and protecting the mothership. Though it is old and it should be a definet factor as to wanting to buy it or not.\nIt control well enough for its age, though the keyboard controls are odd.\nI personaly recomend the game but, it is not for everyone.","December 27, 2015","true","40.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't found anything like it since.\n\nI played more hours of it offline than shown on my Steam account.","July 25, 2011","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
