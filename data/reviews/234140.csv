"http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/recommended/234140/","el_kemosabe","El Kemosabe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/","1115 products in account","Introduction\nMad Max is a post-apocalyptic, open-world action game featuring Max, a man haunted by his past. Your goal is travel across the Sands of Silence but to do so you’re going to have to build a new car capable of the long journey, after your trusty Black on Black is stolen by the Immortal Scrotus. Much to Max’s dismay, he can’t build this car alone and must enlist the help of several characters from across the Great White, including the trusty blackfinger, Chumbucket.\n\nPresentation\nMad Max is an incredibly good looking game. The graphics are excellent even when not running the game on maxed out settings (I was playing on normal-high) but adding all the bells and whistles makes this game absolutely gorgeous. The character and vehicle models are all very detailed, particularly Max and The Magnum Opus (the car you’re building). MM’s User Interface is minimalistic and clean, only showing you information that you need when you need it and most of it stays out of the way during regular gameplay. The main menu, in my opinion, is where the presentation is let down slightly. For the most part the menu is easy to navigate but when choosing settings you have to select each setting before editing it and then save each setting individually, not only did this make changing settings significantly slower than usual, it also meant that I kept accidentally returning to the previous menu by trying to change values before selection the option.\n\nGameplay\nMM’s gameplay predominantly consists of combat, both on-foot and while in vehicles, both are fun but not without issues. Melee combat is effectively the same as in the Batman games apart from the fact that you don’t have to jump all over the room to keep your combo going, Max isn’t quite as agile as Batman. As well as your fists, sometimes you can find melee weapons, such as maces, though these break after a few hits. However, it’s not all good; you’ll never be attacked by two enemies at once (apart from charging enemies) which makes controlling a fight a little too easy, once you start building up a heavy attack you can’t interrupt it to counter an enemy and enemies always use the same tactics so they very quickly become predictable. Vehicular combat is easily one of the best parts of MM, there’s nothing quite as satisfying as taking on a convoy though taking on two or three cars can sometime feel tedious. To aid you in vehicular combat you can unlock and upgrade several weapons throughout the game such as a harpoon, rim grinders and anti-boarder spikes. MM also features several abilities to use during vehicular combat (most of which are unlocked alongside Opus upgrades) such as the ‘ricochet bash’ which smashes you from a car on one side to one on your other side, dealing increased damage.\n\nThese two types of combat are used across the game’s activities. What are these activities? There’s the obvious story missions and side missions, both of which I’ll return to later, but you also can liberate enemy bases, disarm minefields, take down enemy scarecrows and sniper towers, go up in hot air balloons to survey the area you’re in and of course, take down enemy convoys. Apart from the hot air balloons, all of these activities contribute to lowering the danger in a region which in turn unlocks upgrades for the Magnum Opus.\n\nStory\nIf you’re familiar with the films, you’ll know that they aren’t as popular as they are because they have stellar plots, it’s all about the action. This game very much follows the same rule. While the game does have a story-arc it doesn’t really get more complex than what I mentioned in my introduction, it mainly consists of going to certain places to get certain things in order to upgrade the Opus. Of course there are some missions which aren’t like this but those are pretty much just to get them to help you get more Opus parts. I won’t say too much about it, so that I don’t spoil the story for those who care, but I personally found the ending a little disappointing. The final boss fight was nowhere near as difficult as it should have been, I breezed through it in around five minutes, and the story sort of just ends after that fight with no implication as to what Max is going to do, they’re probably setting it up for a sequel or DLC. The main missions and side missions take around 20 hours to complete, the rest of my playtime comes from doing the other activities that I mentioned, not bad for the price.\n\nCustomisation\nMad Max features a great deal of customisation options for three different ‘things’. First and foremost, we have the upgrades for the Magnum Opus, with eighteen different categories and between three and twelve upgrades for each category there are a huge number of options for your car. It’s also not just a case of the more expensive thing is better, some upgrades have a negative impact on your car as well as positive ones so it’s important to find a good balance which suits your play-style. Up next, we have the upgrades for Max himself. With eight different categories there’s a lot you can do with Max; you can choose his jacket, his hair and beard style, what shotgun he uses as well as unlock skills which help you in melee combat. Unlike with the Opus, all of these upgrades (excluding the skills and tools categories where each upgrade is separate) provide and improvement over the one from the previous level. On top of all of these, you also get upgrades from a character called Griffa using Griffa tokens which you earn by levelling up. Griffa upgrades include improved maximum health, longer lasting melee weapons, and the ability to find more water. Lastly, you can upgrade the Strongholds which you find across the Great White, these upgrades directly benefit Max, for example building an Armoury at a Stronghold will refill all of your ammunition when you travel to said Stronghold and building a Water Tower will refill your canteen.\n\nAudio\nThe audio in this game is, apart from the occasional bug, absolutely spot on. The voice acting is excellent, particularly from the actors playing Max, Chumbucket and Stank Gum. The game’s soundtrack is fitting, there’s even a nice little Fury Road easter egg thrown in. The sound effects are also very good, particularly the bone crunching combat sounds and the engine and nitro sounds for the Opus. However, I did encounter an audio bug several times where certain sound effects would not play for minutes at a time such as no engine sound or no sounds during combat.\n\nMiscellaneous\nAs you will have heard, the game’s optimisation is incredibly good, I had a solid 30FPS running the game on normal-high on my pretty mediocre PC\nThe map is pretty damn big, taking a fair few minutes to drive from one end to the other. Of course most of it is empty but what do you expect from a post-apocalyptic wasteland?\nThe non-story/side mission activities get incredibly repetitive, not so much capturing War Boy bases or taking on convoys but driving around to pull down scarecrows or search for scrap gets pretty boring\nThere’s a first person camera for when you’re in a vehicle, not a major thing but it’s pretty cool to see the wasteland through Max’s eyes\nMad Max features the same incredibly good Capture mode as Shadow of Mordor which if you’re a fan of screenshots, is just great. MM’s Capture mode even allows you to record videos, though I didn’t try that out myself\nAs well as the Magnum Opus you can drive any vehicles which you take from enemies and the store in Strongholds\nVerdict\nEssential Purchase.\n\nMad Max is a fantastically good post-apocalyptic, open-world game with great graphics, tons of customisation and a lot of activities to keep you busy.\n\nJust Reviews.\n\nEl K.","September 13, 2015","true","30.5"," 476 of 528 people (90%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","90","476","528","23","35"

Not only did we receive a wonderfully frenetic rebooting of the Mad Max film franchise this year with Mad Mad: Fury Road - an insane post apocalyptic ride into madness that did incredible justice to its source material - here we have Warner Bros. game publishing unit pushing out a film tie-in (no reason to head for the hills just yet or set fire to your cat at the sound of film tie-in) with the expert help of those video game wizards at Avalanche Studios - creators of the explosively destructive Just Cause series whose main protagonist CIA agent Rico Rodriguez mirrors the Max from the film franchise with destructive ease simply replacing the desert with Tropicana. If it initially seemed like a fit made in heaven in the boardrooms of Warner Bros when deciding who to outsource the license to then that person who made the decision to hand the reigns over to Avalanche Studios should be given a nice pat on the back accompanied with a bonus cheque.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=545200255\nAs far as the game goes it's a familiar tale of revenge served with a side order of burly spunk which sees our main protagonist Max undertake a mission to retrieve everything taken from him (including his car) by a war mongering maniac known as Scrotus who is hell bent on post apocalyptic wasteland domination. Thankfully our hero has a sidekick that he tags along  from very early within the game - a grotesque little genius of a mechanic known as Chum Bucket - who convinces our hero to rebuild the Magnum Opus (a car of unparalleled destructive force) and race across the Plains of Silence to silence the demons of the wasteland once and forever. This grand mission will require lots of scrap metal collecting and bonding with various war factions scattered around the large map in order to complete. Completing missions for each of these outposts results in not only special parts being issued which then can be used to further assemble the Magnum Opus but threat levels being lowered in the area which also confers bonuses such as extra ammunition and health being dispensed when visiting each location which certainly does come in handy because the wasteland is filled with punks and maniacs who serve to protect Scrotus domination over the land and who are hellbent on clubbing you into oblivion whether that be on foot or in a vehicle.\n\nYour Magnum Opus won't be much to look at when you first assemble it but putting in some time to deal with Scrotus's threat levels around the map will slowly see you start earning parts that you can upgrade your vehicle with and that incrementally start to make you a force to be reckoned with. It's a slow drip feed reward system that will see you burning rubber from one end of the map to the other and while it does get rather tiresome at a certain point in the game it's still strangely hypnotically satisfying. Hand to hand combat will also feel immediately familiar to anyone who has previously played Assassin's Creed or Batman Arkam franchise as the combat is ripped directly from both those games where you will be surrounded by punks trying to pommel you into dust with the game giving you visual clues when to dodge or block. Vehicle combat on the other hand, which plays out like Need For Speed or The Crew on Crystal Meth, is incredibly satisfying especially when you start to earn various explosive appendages for your vehicle such as Thundersticks or the ability to leave a trail of fire behind you burning anyone or anything that comes into close contact with you. It's hugely entertaining and often results in spectacular non-scripted explosions around you as you take each threat down.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511280079\nWhere Mad Max falters somewhat is that for an open world game it sadly suffers from a strong case of Ubisoft-ituss. Taking a leaf from Ubisoft, who have mined a gold mint out of this particular formula, sadly means that a lot of the irritations that stem from those games have found their way into this release as well. Many of the quest you undertake will have you running from one end of the map to the next dealing with some faction that plays out exactly the same as the previous twenty before them. There is very little variety and soon each encounter starts to bleed into the next. The game also makes the mistake of thinking ramping up difficulty is solved by simply throwing more enemies at you - which as some of you will already know is a passionate gripe of mine when it comes to open world games. Also for a surprisingly large map their is very little variety in terms of what you can do which is a sad shame because it does get repetitive. I had to take weeks long breaks from the game because of this repetition which would sadly lead to boredom if unchecked.\n\nOn a whole though Mad Max is a real treat that runs like a hot knife through butter. Mad Max is optimized within an inch of its life and I never encountered a single issue bug wise with the game. Mad Max was one of the few games for me that simply just worked out of the box and for that I am incredibly grateful...so much so that I will be pre-purchasing Just Cause 3 based on my experiences with this game. Avalanche Studios needs to be commended for putting out a game that wasn't a complete train wreck at launch. Mad Max, while employing sparse environments, looks absolutely stunning and makes use of an excellent in game weather system that really cranks up the excitement levels when storms approach (which are often brutal experiences to ride out).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=524705382\nMad Max is officially my sleeper hit of 2015. Seriously, and in all honesty, I was not expecting much from it but I was pleasantly surprised by the game at most turns. Criticisms aside you could honestly do a lot worse with that hard earned cash of yours and for pure unadulterated fun - it doesn't get more insane or trippy than Mad Max. While it may not necessarily have the full mighty roar of a must have AAA title you would be silly to pass this one up.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","November 20, 2015","true","101.1"," 502 of 566 people (89%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","89","502","566","33","17"

And that's also very good so far. Voice acting is top and the whole scenery and atmosphere is great. It's Mad Max. And you can be Mad Max.\n\nSo let me make this clear. It's not a shooter. There are guns and you can shoot them but the focus is not at shooting. The driving and fist fighting takes the most of it. And what a pleasure that is!\n\nThey took a long look at some very good games out there and mold it together to make Mad Max look great. They succeeded. Great game, lots of fun.\n\nYep, after 5 hours of gameplay I can see where this is going. Another lots of sleepless nights.\n\nAfter 45 hours of gameplay: Yep, it's a very good and addictive game. I saw some reviews with a bit of complaining 'bout that it gets the same after a while. Taking a break now and then will help. After an 8 hours work shift everyone wants to go home and do something else. But after a view hours of 'doing something else' it's great to step in Mad Max's shoes again. They get comfortable the more you wear it.\n\nAfter 80 hours of gameplay: Woh, time is getting abstract playing this game. That's always a good sign when you're having fun. There are some very good missions here. Got the heart pounding and the adreneline rushing. Almost have completed the map but still not sure how much more I get and I realy don't wanna know. As far as I'm concerned this game can go on and on and on. I got 73% of the achievements so the end must be near. My advise is to don't rush the missions and first clear out the regions one by one and do the missions when they are in the regions you cleared out. And take your time and enjoy searching for all the goodies! It'll be over too soon.

(same production team)\n\nDo you enjoy a post apocalyptic setting?\n\nDo you enjoy an action game with RPG elements?\n\nDo you remember that playing games is supposed to be fun?\n\nCount up your "yes" answers and if they're 50% or more yes, then that's your answer on whether or not to get this game.\n\nTrust the gamers, the Steam reviewers who paid for the game to play it.  Do not trust the media sites, the ones who only give positive coverage when it suits their political agenda.  Or when a certain company *konami* flies them out to a private hotel for a week so they can play their game.","September 2, 2015","true","31.5"," 747 of 913 people (82%) found this review helpful 74 people found this review funny","82","747","913","74","45"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/234140/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Mad Max is an intriguing game to review, and a tough one to succinctly assess. It captures the atmosphere of its source material very well, presenting an open world of majestic dunes and industrial wreckage, replete with anarchy, chaos and quasi-spiritual linguistic quirks. Avalanche toss players right into this turbulent land, and the game thrives in the moments where Max is jostling with War Boy raiders on the open road or tossing ignited cans of gasoline into their scrappy fortresses. But it’s also a title which seems, at some point, to have gone through significant changes (perhaps related to its delay in 2014), and some of the hastier joins around the story pacing, resource systems and progression mechanics still remain.\n\nBefitting of a Mad Max game, the vast majority of the plot concerns Max’s tireless quest for a V8 engine. He’s forced to build a new car (with the help of the irrepressible sidekick/acolyte Chumbucket), after his famous Interceptor is stolen by a roid-abusing chap with the very Mad Max name of Scabrous Scrotus. Though this encounter leaves him bruised and bereft of car, clothes and equipment, Max does at least leave a chainsaw blade in Scrotus’ forehead for good measure. In order to piece together a vehicle worthy of Chumbucket’s ‘Magnum Opus’ moniker, Max needs to roam the dusty wastelands, scavenging scrap, trading favours with local warlords, and ramming or punching every War Boy, Buzzard or general road filth who tries to get in his way.\n\nPretty much everything in Mad Max is upgraded through the scrap resource (including, somewhat bizarrely, Max’s combat skills), so any of the open world activities that reward scrap are potentially worth doing. Luckily, that’s basically all of them; so unless you have a worrying compulsion to clear the entire map of icons it’s possible to almost exclusively stick to the things you enjoy. A few of the story missions will force you into owning certain upgrades or tackling specific side-areas, but this is kept in moderation.\n\nAvalanche’s art team have done just as tremendous a job as their technical division (the game runs incredibly well even on minimum-spec PCs), creating a dozen or so desert zones that actually look distinct from one another. Red, Mojave-like scrublands border rolling dunes, which in turn become rockier, mesa-filled landscapes, or areas pocketed by vents of near-luminous sulfur. For an area of land that’s ostensibly barren, it offers a palette of bold colours and striking, post-civilisation landmarks.\n\nRoaring through these realms in pursuit of a convoy, harpoon primed to pull wheels off escorts, War Boy boarders tumbling in your wake, and a well-aimed shotgun blast turning another wheeled foe into a spinning, combusting ball of debris, is one of Mad Max’s most exhilarating diversions. The versatile Shadow of Mordor-esque photo mode isn’t just in the game for moody shots of the desert, it’s also for snapping some of the magnificent explosions in full bloom.\n\nThe various camps, hide-aways, and ramshackle dwellings scattered across the wastes do eventually end up seeming over-familiar. For a decent while though, it’s a delight to roll up on a new location, comb it for scrap, engage in some un-gentlemanly BatMax fisticuffs with the locals, and explore whether there are any unique, handcrafted little dioramas contained with. Such encounters are only enhanced by the random events of Max’s world. You may end up having to deal with a honking patrol showing up while you’re on foot and vulnerable, or a powerful dust storm bellowing its way across the dry earth.\n\nOf such things are the finest of Mad Max’s moments made. There are some shonkier aspects though, which aren’t gigantic problems in themselves but are amplified by being repeated across hours upon hours of playing. Max has a bit of a case of ‘Geralt movement’, where the weight of his animation will often carry him beyond the ladder, box of scrap, or weapon you’re trying to line him up with. A great many things in this game demand that you stand somewhat perfectly in front of them and hold down E (or equivalent) for a bit, so that gets rather old.\n\nIt’s also extremely aggravating to have to watch an almost-cut-scene every single time Max tips gasoline into something or refills his water canteen (effectively your back-up health potion, and probably preferable to the other options of consuming maggots and dog food). This is borderline crazy, because I’m pretty sure it all still happens in-engine. Having the game cut to black after those actions makes very little sense. If modding is ever possible, the removal of these repeat irritations must be a priority.\n\nThough it doesn’t directly detract from a lot of the fun, Mad Max shows various signs of features being hastily changed or wrapped up before they were quite ready. The game’s opening tries to impress the importance of fuel and water for survival, when in fact those resources are now found in abundance across the wasteland (I never ran out of fuel, and having an empty canteen has no additional penalty).\n\nEvery ‘Top Dog’ mini-boss looks basically the same, attacks in the same manner (a couple do have assistance from underlings), and may even use the same voice actor. Encounters in the wasteland offer ‘intel’ on these fights, vaguely hinting at a sort of Mordor Nemesis system of particular weaknesses, but it’s obvious stuff like ‘he doesn’t like being shivved in the neck!’ The same tactics which work on all of them. Clearing minefields seems like a hold-over from a time where Max was intended to regularly use a wider selection of vehicles than the Magnum Opus. You can still collect a full set of cars, but outside of races or a sneaky plan to drop mines in front of a convoy, only the mine-clearing buggy (and attendant dog) has such a specific purpose.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the Magnum Opus upgrades are tied to the reduction of ‘threat’ in different regions, and that can mean having to take time off from your campaign of chaos to settle into some familiar busywork. Getting the top level harpoon (the only one which can reliably yank down the most hardy ‘scarecrow’ structures dotted around the land, and one of the most hilarious weapons overall), means sniffing out a whole lot of minefields.\n\nSome of the unlocking methodology may irritate, but the way upgrades for the Opus are handled is quite novel. Later armor and ramming options are not automatically the best way to go; they’re heavy, and become a trade-off with speed and handling. In this sense, you do actually have to design a workable car to some extent. It’s refreshing that the ‘last’ upgrade in a chain isn’t automatically superior by default, but is instead a new variable to consider.\n\nMad Max has its fair share of quirks and odd design decisions, but creates a sandbox of anarchic chaos that’s both wonderfully rendered and, on PC, a technical marvel. A word on the sound design too, which is just as responsible as the art design and animation for capturing the whump of explosions and jaw-breaking punches alike. There’s much to revel in. But although it’s appropriate that a game from this universe should feel like some aspects are misshapen or hastily bodged into shape to fit a grander vision, the annoyances really peel away at you over the course of a title as long as this one. Like the original 1979 film, Mad Max seems destined to be a cult classic; beloved by many, in spite of the components that appear to have been ripped out and reassembled, or otherwise abandoned to the desert basin.","October 16, 2015","true","132.0"," 227 of 259 people (88%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","88","227","259","19","5"

Also, good luck with racing in the game, if you even as much get hit and swerve into the rocks while driving, you might as well restart the race because it takes forever to catch up to your enemy drivers while avoiding hazards to make sure your vehicle does not spontaneously combust while skating through the crisco wasteland. That may not happen to others, I don't know but that is my opinion.\n\nThe other little minor issue I have is the weak ending. Throughout the game you will also have your share of boss battles which they all fight in the same pattern pretty much, either dodge out of the way to avoid their powerful attack or click the mouse to counter their attacks and lay into them with a series of punches and kicks as you will also go into fury mode which turns you into a ninja and you become a buffed up one man wrecking crew..but yeah the bosses were kind of weak, especially the ending boss, oh god the ending boss, which made the ending feel anti climatic..\nI mean here is the build up for the Lord of the wasteland called Scrotus, built up to make him look like a complete bad a**, and what do they do? Oh let's just put him into a car playing scaredy cat as we toss like 3-4 harpoons at him..and thats it..thats the last boss. Also the ending story just came out of nowhere as I felt like it was rushed, once again, maybe it was just me but they could have done something more to it.\n\nOther than that, graphics are great, I love traveling through the desolate wasteland to the creepy tunnels.\nMusic and everything else is pretty good.\n\nSo on this game it is kind of in the middle for me, but I do recommend it, just let the price go down a bit and then see what you guys will think. It is a good game with a decent length of 15-25 hours of gameplay depending on how many missions you go on.\nSo yeah, a little repetitive but still something worth checking out.","September 19, 2015","true","16.5"," 182 of 212 people (86%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","86","182","212","19","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/234140/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Mad Max is a third person, action game set in an open world environment, based on the Mad Max film series. It was released on September 1st 2015 on PC, PS4 and Xbox One. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic setting, much like Fallout New Vegas, we have plenty of deserts, canyons, wreckage and tunnels to explore.  You play the character, Max Rocktanksky on the story to regain your lost car, and along the way you will build your own car, The Magnum Opus.\n\nGame play within Mad Max is very heavily focused around vehicular style. Half the game is based inside of your car and you are having to deal with other enemies in their cars as well as on foot. You can use a series of different techniques, whether it be simply ramming the opponents, using your shotgun to blow tires out, or your harpoon weapon to take down the threats.  The other half of the game is done in a commonly seen third person action style - this is extremely similar to the style of combat on show in the Batman Arkham series of games. The hand to hand combat is simply brilliantly put together and you can pull of some amazing combos, blocks and parries, and it all looks so fluently done.\n\nI played this game on 4k resolution, so of course the game looks good, but seriously, this is the best looking game on PC I have seen. It just looks gorgeous, every single one of the textures is high resolution, the animations are perfect, some amazing screenshots can be taken. One would probably expect that when on 4k, but it still looks amazing when playing on the lower resolutions, I'm not even going to say 1080 is low, it looks gorgeous even on that.  It's easy to see why they pulled production on this game being released on the PS3 and Xbox360, I would think even the current gen consoles would struggle with this.\n\nThe story in Mad Max is a stand alone and is in no way related to any of the films. As someone who has only seen the recent Mad Max film, I didn't have much nostalgia going into this game, but I can honestly say that I was drawn into the plot from the get go. I got attached to the characters straight away, Chumbucket (your cars mechanic) becomes your friend as you progress through the game and quickly turns into a friendly companion. There are some scenes which really take your breathe away as they are very unpredictable and some of which had shouting out in sheer horror as to what was happening, that is just how invested I got into this game's plot.\n\nThis game is not exactly a difficult game to play. The Arkham style combat mechanism is very easy to pick up and pretty much master and the art of vehicle combat can very easily be learnt after a few trial runs. The boss fights in the game can be pretty challenging, as they should be, and you will probably have to redo a few of them until you nail down the perfect fight. You will more than likely die more from accidentally blowing your self up, driving down a cavern which has no bottom, or something silly which you weren't really meaning to happen. As with most open world games like this, you can really make your character way too overpowered for the stage in the story you are on with upgrades and stat increases, so if you too much, you can soon make the game have no challenging aspect at all.\n\nThe open world side of this game is truly awesome. I have never seen a map so full of things to do, areas to explore, items to find, hidden objects to locate, side quests, everything. There is literally never a minute in this game where I was bored. If you don't feel like doing a story mission, go for a drive into the dessert and kill some bad guys for more scrap to upgrade your car. Want to go do some exploration? Go digging in an under ground cave for that hidden object to tick off the list. There is literally something every 30 seconds of traveling in game to see or do. Some open world games feel like they are as vast as an ocean, but as deep as a puddle. Mad Max completely blows that theory out of the water. Not to mention the world is absolutely huge, there is so much depth to whats in it, you will never struggle to find something to do.\n\nOn the topic of side quests, another nice little mechanic which I really loved in this game, was the ability to upgrade towns and strongholds which you venture into, by completing "Projects", these are simply a style of fetch quest which in turns gives you a little buff in that area of the map you are in, such as whenever you come back to town, you'r ammo gets replenished or something. A key one to try work your way towards in every town, is to collect scrap even when offline, it's nice to login after a few hours to see you've collated a few hundred scrap and can now upgrade your car!\n\nThe full story, and I would say 80% of the side missions completed, took me just over twenty five hours to complete. That to me is a huge amount of content, purely from the story mode and the side missions alone, I still have plenty of hidden objects I want to seek out, strongholds to take over, cars to unlock and races to take part in, this is easily another ten hours worth of content to see. Not to mention the amount of achievements on offer too. I only reached 18 out of 49 on my run through, so there is plenty to do on that side of things too.\n\nEven though I was playing on 4k resolution, with all of the options at max graphical settings, I was still getting a constant 60 FPS. This game is perfectly optimized for any rig, and will run like a dream on almost anything if you set the options correctly. The only technical problems I ran into, was that sometimes the dialog on a few of the NPCs in the open world sometimes cut out half way through, but as long as you have subtitles on, that won't really make a difference - it only happened three or four times for me in the 25 hours I have played.\n\nIn my opinion, I think Mad Max is going to be a surprise contender for "Game of the Year 2015", it is simply amazing and I will go as far to say it is in my top 10 best games of all time. Hats off to Avalanche Studios, and Warner Brothers, who have redeemed them selves ever so slightly with this amazing PC release. Do not waste any more time and get this game now!\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

(This is a plus because it means at least 100+ hours of  game play.)\n\n+The driving feels solid, and the collisions are very satisfying.\n\n+ The combat is very similar to the Batman Arkham series, with powerful combos and counters, taking on 5 - 10 people at once.\n\n+ The game map is massive. I couldn't tell you how many miles it is, but at full speed in a car with nitro it takes about six minutes to go from Jeets (East) to Pinky's (West.) And it's a relatively short distance on the map.\n\n+ DOZENS of upgrades for Max himself, and the Magnum Opus (your car.)\n\n+ Your actions feel like they influence the world, and have weight on it's people and economy.\n\n+ The lack of guns has no impact on the game.

You can't climb just any ledge or rock. Due to there being so many of these areas, however, the game does not feel linear at all.\n\n- The Sniper Rifle Mod for the car is more of a tool than an actual weapon. Yes, it kills people, but you can only use it from the Magnum Opus. You'll end up just using it for reconnoiter and safely taking out key defenses.\n\n- With any massive open world game there is a bit of repetitiveness. Collecting scrap can become tedious in the beginning, but eventually people will help you when you build up the strongholds.\n\n- Chumbucket can get a little annoying. But that's not really a bad thing on the game's part. Just my preference for his character.\n\n- I've found a few bugs. But not many.\n\nSometimes the map won't open and you have to exit the game to reset it.\nStomping out rats and lizards for food can sometimes launch you into the air, which will result in you dying upon hitting the ground.\nThe pause menu can get stuck on a bio entry, even if you've read it. But it's easy to just click out to where you need to go.\nThe game doesn't like it when the car rolls........ .... ..... ..\nAll in all, the game is awesome. Pick it up if you can.

The setting works, the design of many missions is valid, the overall gameplay is rich and well structured and the stages of guidance are very entertaining. In contrast, the fighting is dignified but nothing more, the activities on the distance can tire out and if you don't structure your game there is the risk of encountering too many "walls" along the flow of the main quests.","November 8, 2015","true","239.5"," 120 of 137 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","120","137","7","2"

Now I am absolutely convinced this lack is a flaw.\n\nWhat if all that scrap scrap everywhere scrap would have been components instead,\nor the lack of water and oil was a bit more preminent, more crucial?\n\nWhat was good, remains good:\n\nThe relics (THIS is the best for me: to see pictures and words of the vanished world we still live in, for now). I look behind every stone in the desert for those.\n\nThe storms!\nTHAT is what I'd like the game to be: a struggle for survival more than a normal action movie that it is.\n\nA bit more of madness: that's what this (almost a) masterpiece lacks.\n\nMore Mad and less Max.\n\nOn the other hand, once you own the game USE the screenshot editor, because it adds a solid +50% of fun to the game.","September 15, 2015","true","110.3"," 115 of 142 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","115","142","6","7"

The pre-release gameplay videos didn't impress me. They didn't look like the movies. I wanted to play the movies!\n\nI'm proud to say that this game is a genuine Mad Max experience. I played Mad Max as if it was one of the movies, and it was ♥♥♥♥ing great.\n\nThe obvious highlight is the car combat. It's the greatest. There's a mini road war around every corner, and they make for the best screenshots. This game has a photo mode. It kicks ♥♥♥. Look at my screenshot library. Come on, do it.\n\nThe on-foot combat uses the Arkham system, but you can't win by closing your eyes and mashing left-click. I've tried it in Arkham and Mad Max. It didn't work this time. This pleases me. Somehow, large volumes of enemies actually can become overwhelming, at least until you've upgraded your melee skill.\n\nYou can make your own Magnum Opus! Your own car! You can deck it out with spikes, rams, hood ornaments, and pretty colors. There's also several sets of pre-made vehicles, called "Archangels." They suck. You'll hate them too. They ought to leave them out of the sequel (a sequel? Yea, I'd dig it).\n\nNow, this next bit split the critics from the average gamer-- the wasteland is loaded with an endless amount of activities to enjoy. I love this. Too often will I play a sandbox game and grow bored when I discover there's absolutely nothing to do but shoot at cops (Grand Theft something or other). Mad Max gave me enough distractions to have fun for at least 50 hours.\n\nOh, and there's parallax occlusion. If there's one thing I enjoy in life, it's parallax occlusion. Mmm....\n\nYea, it's gr--\nfine, I'll say it.\nWhat a lovely game.\nI said it. You can go now.

A wasteland-grifter hybrid of Tom Hardy and Mel Gibson who can be upgraded to look like a member of the Duck Dynasty cast. You are on a mission to do righteous work.\n\nAccompying you on your journey is a Igor-like wrench jockey with some sort of weird fetish problem. This man will follow you along on your missions by riding in the back of your car and assisting you with repairs.\n\nThis will come in handy because at every turn there are cars with floating health bars that will not go away and are determined to ruin the incredibly immersive [buzzword] environment. Speaking of the environment it at times is one of the best you've ever seen and at other times is something you'll think looks like it should have released 5 years ago.\n\nAs you progress in your Farcry/Shadow of Mordor inspired quest you will unlock new abilities for your car which drives like it's on rails and your character who fights like a bar brawling version of Batman. Press A to attack, press Y to dodge. Originality doesn't end with Max's combat however, oh no no, there are tons more original and immersive [buzzword] features. Such as; all ladders in the entire world being the same color, repeated NPC dialogue, button mashing, mini cutscenes for the most mundane of moments like getting water or pulling out pliers to disarm a mine. I could go on but I don't want to spoil to many of these innovative new concepts.\n\nThe desert is what really pulls all of this together. The game sports possibly the best looking sky and cloud effects ever and they can look stunning against the open desert with it's jutting rocks and the reddish-orange sun rising behind. They are so good that they are almost not totally ruined by the non-removable or resizable HUD and constant objective reminders.\n\nCar combat can be fun and some of the weaponry is cool. Dragging an enemy behind you while you drive away is awesome especially since the enemy stays highlighted with bright white the entire time completely removing any confusion that the model is supposed to maybe represent a human being.\n\nYou will level up by clearing enemy settlements and other lived in locations that are within walking distance of each other but seemingly unaware of each other. That type of overcrowded and oblivoious atmosphere really sells the authenticity.\n\n\nYou will go mad as you slowly realize the unfulfilled potential of this game. As another glorious moment is ruined by a bad camera angle or text blasting across your screen. As you go to take a screenshot with capture mode and realize the stupid health bars appear over the vehicles still. As you listen to another line of canned corn dialogue and watch another cinematic knock out that you've seen 1,000 times playing Batman. As you listen to the score which sounds like it may possibly be comprised of tracks that were cut from other games. As you drive around aimlessly while listening to your Igor Look-a-like companion creepily sexualize your vehicle as he begs you to work on it.\n\nAs you drive into the sand you see hope, a man with a bandana, a dog and a cyborg arm approaches. But alas he is only an apparition, an illusion of heatstroke..... you really spent your money on this instead.","September 2, 2015","true","13.8"," 204 of 278 people (73%) found this review helpful 139 people found this review funny","73","204","278","139","22"

His car gets stolen, and a lot of people want to kill him, his only friend being a crazy mechanic who is basically Smeagol high on Petrol fumes. Walking around a desert with sand in your boots all day would make anyone mad.\n\nThis sets Max on a quest to build the perfect car, the Magnum Opus, which draws a lot of comparisons with how the game plays. Like the Opus, the game itself is incredibly well optimised; it runs smoothly, at a very high frame rate, and has clearly been crafted with a lot of care and attention. The downside to this is that I feel like they could have used those spare resources to do more with the game engine, to make the game look better than it currently does - it's not ugly, but there is definitely room for an upgraded "Definitive Edition" later down the road. AA does a mediocre job of eliminating jaggies and it would be nice to have an MSAA option, with higher quality textures.\n\nUsing a third-party injector, I managed to improve the colour palette - a desert will never be bright and shiny and colourful, but there's definitely room to enhance and sharpen the existing palette. All in all, it's beautiful to behold, and the night sky is a sight to behold.\n\nI've never been a fan of the films, but I love this game's story. It's clearly explained, I know exactly what's going on at all times, and it's interesting. I also like the upgrade system, which is fairly comprehensive and gives you some great options to customise both Max and the Magnum Opus.\n\nA lot of folks complained that I hadn't spent much time with the game and therefore had no right to judge it, so I'm changing my review to reflect having spent more time with the game - I now give it an 8.5 out of 10. While it may not technically be the best game ever made, for me, it ticks all the right boxes and does a LOT of things right.

Max is still Max - the reluctant, passive-agressive antihero who can't even remember why he keeps going day after day.  He simply goes as he always has, because no matter how much he wants to stop he just doesn't know how even if the world would let him.\n\nIt will be more fun for fans of open-world scavenging and OCD completionists than those who want an amazing plot.  And that's why you should buy it on sale, because $60 is too much.  it's a good game that oozes atmosphere and has some interesting characters.  But the story is barely there.

Fun and has a lot of mission s in an open world.\nI'm not gonna dwell on the story cause it's just there to be there and to give you a purpose. Nothing special to it\n\nThe gameplay is where this game shines, you have a car with a massive list of parts that you can upgrade you have three main aspects to it: Speed, handling and strength. You can either have a car that is good at all of them or a car that is great at two and weak at the other. the customization is also complex and fun, it's not just you trying to max out every category, you also have to keep in mind the down side to every upgrade.\n\nUpgrading Max himself is also just as fun. Learning new combat moves never felt like I'm wasting scrap (the currency in the game). Each move felt unique and useful from reversals to wall slamming to limb breaking. The game is also VERY violent and gory which makes it even better for me. You'll face different types of enemies that will require you to use most of you moves along the game.\n\nThe open worlds of this game is one of the best I've ever seen in any video game. All the roads connect to each other and it's extremely nonrestrictive which is a huge plus. Each area has a big balloon where you can spot landmarks and "Threats" that you need to lower in order to unlock new upgrades for you and your car\n\nThe graphics in this are superb, especially when it comes to lights, shadows, tire and footstep trails. The game looks pretty colorful and well done. Can't ask for much more than this\n\nThe sound isn't up to the game's standard. I often found myself not being able to precisely pinpoint where the sound is coming from, but overall it's serviceable.\n\nFor the most part this game is bug free, though I did find myself getting stuck on minute objects but there isn't a persistent bug worth mentioning.","May 17","true","107.0"," 54 of 60 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","54","60","2","6"

When I first heard of this game I thought "oh a movie tie in that will follow the film plot and be pretty pointless". However, I was able to get this game on a good deal and was surprised to find this a great example of how to do a movie tie in.\n\nYou take the role of Mad Max and meet a character called Chum Bucket early on. You then spend the time together helping out allies by destroying enemy landmarks and capturing camps. As you progress you earn scrap that can be used to upgrade your car and Max himself.\n\nYou spend a lot of the game in your car, which you would expect, and the battles you have with other road users seem to work well with Harpoons and your Shotgun being essential gear.\n\nThe story itself is short and sweet, and It is in addition to the film and allows you to delve into Max's world even deeper. As you are in a fairly open world you can also compete in races, collect relics or farm scrap to your hearts desire. I plugged many hours into the game doing just that and although I have had my fill, did not manage to get all the achievements by the games end. I might be tempted to go back though at a later date.\n\nThe game isn't too difficult but adds a fair challenge at certain stages and is great fun to play. Definately in my top 5 games of 2015. Unfortunately I think it was over shadowed by Metal Gear being released at a similar time.\n\nNow I am just hoping for a Bullet Farm DLC.\n","September 23, 2015","true","57.3"," 62 of 73 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","62","73","0","0"

None.\nUnless you count looking less arze with each stage, but yeah..\n\n*So this is supposed to be related to Fury Road right?\nSupposedly, but there are no real ties between the movie and the game, in either direction.\nMax himself also acts wildly differently between the movie and the game, it doesn't even seem like they're the same person.\nCompared to the movie, in the game barely anybody has guns and Max can't fight anywhere near as good in the movie as he does in the game.\nBut now I'm stepping towards reviewing the movie instead of the game so let's drop it here shall we.\n\n\nAll in all, if you like Mad Max, you'll get a thrill or two out of this generally casual game, but it's certainly not worth full price, it's more along the lines of 15-20 euros.","October 2, 2015","false","37.0"," 338 of 502 people (67%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","67","338","502","28","25"

The storms you encounter in the wasteland are something to behold, especially as they come rolling towards you in the distance. The textures could stand to be a higher resolution, and occasionally glare out at you. But for the more part, Mad Max has done a great job crafting a desert that you're actually interested in exploring. Also of worthy note is the audio. Voice acting is well done, though Max himself can sound kind of strange at times. Sound Effects are fantastic and satisfying. Guns sound like they're actually powerful, explosions are wonderful to behold, and sandstorms are ridiculously intense. The combat animations in the game are also quite well done.    Gameplay  8  If you have played Shadow of Mordor, that's a great game to compare Mad Max to, gameplay wise. You spend the majority of your time exploring locations for scrap, destroying enemy camps, and competing in the occasional race. Combat is a simple combination of buttons to punch, execute, block, dodge, and shoot. Even after several hours of combat, I've found it still very enjoyable to smash some War Boy's faces in. There is no stealth in this game, and the variety of weapons is mediocre (shotgun, thunderpoon, harpoon, occasional melee weapons on the ground which all function the same way, and your fists). Driving your car is at the heart of this game, and Mad Max knows this. It can take a little bit to get used to driving your car, and sometimes you'll find yourself wondering why it spun out the way it did, but for the more part it is an entertaining ride through the wasteland. Car Combat is also very well done, with satisfying impacts as you smash into other vehicles, and a few options on how to take them down (shoot out the tires, pull the driver out with a harpoon, dismantle the car with a harpoon, etc). Of note is the upgrade system for your car. Max's upgrade system feels almost pointless, as it simply serves to make him stronger. However, your car is where the upgrades shine, with each upgrade offering different advantages/disadvantages. There is plenty of customization on the car to fit your style.     Story  6  I am not yet done with the storyline, but thus far it has been relatively engrossing. I won't say to much as to spoil anything, but Mad Max does do a decent job of keeping you curious what will happen next. The story does take many hours to complete, so there is plenty of content there.    Multiplayer  N/A  This game is single-player only.    Replayability  6  This is a toss up. While a very enjoyable game to hop into and beat folks up/destroy some cars, I don't see Mad Max as a game that one would come back to over and over. This is simply because of the fact that anything other than the main quest in the game can become somewhat repetitive. Mad Max's redeeming factor in this field is how satisfying the combat is, both on foot and in the car.    Overall  7.2/10  While a solid, mostly bug-free, wonderfully optimized game, Mad Max suffers from being a little to repetitive at times. That being said, I would recommend Mad Max to most any gamer, as the gameplay is very well done, and as a whole the game is fun experience. Take the chance to explore a well-crafted wasteland, and some of the best car combat I've seen in a game.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster","September 3, 2015","true","25.3"," 63 of 76 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","63","76","4","0"

Yes, the missions and tasks were repetitive and, yes, the combat was more of the same from Batman or Shadow of Mordor but the world was immersive enough, attractive enough (in its own wasteland way) and just plain fun enough to keep me returning.\n\nNearly every "repetitive" aspect managed to find a way to stay interesting.  Melee combat felt heavy and brutal and slamming a guy's head into a wall or suplexing him never got old for me.  There's a hundred or so locations where you can seek scrap metal or water but they varied from tents to old subway cars to cliffside villages to abandoned restaurants to deep caves.  You're tasked with tearing down giant metal "scarecrows" but, to the last, I enjoyed flying past (or through) them, launching a harpoon and collapsing them behind my racing vehicle.  You'll do a LOT of driving but the landscape is wonderfully created as you progress from dried ocean bottom to ravaged desert towns and upland desert to the mountains of waste and scrap surrounding Gastown.\n\nVehicular combat is a special joy and from early on you are armed with a harpoon that can tear off armor, tires or doors or pull a War Boy out of his car or a sniper out of his tower.  Further car enhancements allow you to attach grinders to your wheels Ben-Hur style or launch explosive spears to quickly end a fight.\n\nThe game certainly isn't perfect.  Boss fights are almost all copies of each other, clearing mine fields is tedious busy work and there is a major plot-required race that deviates from all the other driving you'll do in game.  The plot is nothing special and this game is definitely more about the journey than the destination.  But Mad Max and the Wastelands kept me coming back for more days on end managed to never feel "old".","September 22, 2015","true","92.6"," 57 of 67 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","57","67","3","2"

I've sampled every different type of open world activity and have unlocked all the core "equipment" under Max's glossary.\n\nLet's start with what Mad Max *isn't* for those who may be looking for something specific: Mad Max is not a survival game. It has gameplay elements that sound like they would belong in a survival game like water and food scrounging, but this is an open world sandbox action game. Because it's an open world game, it's not as focused on delivering a narrative and tightly scripted action scenes as the recent "Fury Road".\n\nNow let's get down to what Mad Max is. Mad Max is an excellent open world sandbox in the vein of Just Cause. I say "sandbox" specifically because this game gives you a vast number of things to do and unleashes you upon the world to do them. Besides a few main quest goals (the story is frontloaded in the first few hours, as far as I can tell), you are given leave to plunder the wasteland while reducing the threat level presented by the big bad warlord Max is seeking to topple.\n\nThe graphics in Max's wasteland are solid and I never felt like the world was merely one big desert. This really becomes apparent when you ascend in a scouting balloon and see just how many interesting land features there are to explore. In a way it reminds me of the Fallout series, barren but interesting. The sound design, though, is the real star. Engines revving, powerful explosions, and the crack of Max's shotgun and punches really sell the brutal experience.\n\nI can see the core gameplay loop of Max getting old if you don't particularly enjoy the activities of car combat, fighting, and exploring camps. However, I quite enjoyed the "Arkham" style combat and the great combat racing that allows you to slow down time to execute amazing attacks against foes that scream along the roads at breakneck speeds.I think it's safe to say that if you played tons of Just Cause (the other game these devs are famous for) then you'll love this game, but if you're looking for an open world game with an involved narrative like GTA or The Witcher, you may be less excited to take your twentieth bandit camp.\n\nI'd say Mad Max is a definitely worth a buy if you love the post apocalypse and want to spend hours tweaking a cool car, exploring camps and caves, and turning Max from a scrawny survivor into a Top Dog of the wastes (with an epic beard to match).","September 2, 2015","true","51.8"," 48 of 55 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","48","55","4","0"

I didn‘t expect much when i first saw the trailer. But the game came out and it‘s pretty good.

No one expected a good game so maybe that‘s why almost nobody got disappointed by it.\n\nThe game begins when you lose your car and you need to get your car back. That‘s the story. Yeah it‘s crap, same as the latest movie. But this game is not about story. It‘s about doing repetitive tasks and it‘s kinda fun no matter how ridiculous it sounds. You drive around gathering scrap which then can be used to upgrade your skills and car. The combat mechanics are simple but fun. It‘s very similar to Batman games, you mash one button and press another one to counter attack. There are guns in the game but you rarely use them. Shotgun can be used to shoot the gas tanks to blow up the cars and also shoot bad people in the face then eat some maggots from a dead person‘s rotten stomach to replenish your lost health.\nThere‘s also some racing which is quite fun but sometimes can be really frustrating.\nResource gathering is simplified to the maximum. The gas will never end, you rarely will be out of bullets or with no health. You can replenish everything just by going to the base. Or you just find every resource on every step.\nGraphics are beautiful in this game. The scenery is amazing. I have never thought that desert could look so beautiful. There‘s a screenshot feature similar to Shadow of Mordor, where you can stop the game and take the screenshot. This should be available in all the games. Some people love to take screenshots and it really helps and makes screenshots look so much better.\n\nIf you want a simple, maybe a bit relaxing game and you‘re not afraid of repetitiveness buy this game you will not be disappointed.\n\nPros\n\nDriving, smashing and blowing up things is fun\nCombat feels nice\nGraphics\nSound\n\nCons\n\nPoor story\nVery repetitive","December 16, 2015","true","37.7"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","41","46","3","4"

They often feel sterile, clunky, and have too much emphasis and effort (read: money which translates into final asking price) put into the high-end graphics.\n\nWhile Mad Max has its fair-share of some of these traits, its darn good and quite addicting. It is a pleasant surprise, honestly. I find myself returning to it again and again.\n\nEssentially, this is a sandbox game where you collect-and-conquer to have bigger and better stats. The upgraded stats are mainly focused on your car and your avatar. The game plays and feels like a movie - and is fairly well done in that regard. You have a companion through most of the game which reduces how lonely the world could feel. It works quite well. There is a lot to do and a lot to look at - and oh boy is it beautiful. It runs so butter, too.\n\nPros:\n+Amazing atmosphere and graphics - and it runs so great. Not a hickup in performance to be found.\n+Very addicting, especially in shorter play sessions. Collecting scrap and gaining upgrades that really make you more powerful is so awesome. I even recently built something that collects scrap when I'm not playing. Its going AdVenture Capitalist on me, and I'm loving it.\n+The storyline and characters are all well done. The voice acting is top-notch, and they all fit in the atmosphere.\n+The companion makes the game feel much more real and alive.\n+Lots of random events and gangs are roaming the world, which make it further believable.\n+The sandbox is huge. Over 10 hours in and I haven't even visited 60% of the map.\n+Tons of vehicles and they all feel different.\n+Metric tons of unlockables.\n+The difficulty level is fairly easy - which, at least for me, is a breath of fresh air from tough-as-nails indie games that I usually deal with.\n\nMeh:\n=Some people report camera problems when fighting - I didn't find this to be the case. I did find the camera is as equally annoying as it is in any 3D AAA game.\n\nCons:\n-Like many AAA games, the core mechanic is very simple. For the most part you only need like two buttons lol. Press 'A' to do most things. This is partly why most find this game best played in short play sessions.\n-Missions can get repetitive, which again, is why this game is best played in short play sessions. Its fine, and definately adds near infinite replayability (new missions spawn constantly), but they can start to feel meaningless over larger time.\n\nOverall, this is a great game, that is likely worth the high price tag.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/recommended/234140/","BavarianGod","[AReV]BavarianGod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/","3478 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEsg-ZUjzrs\n\nThe video game world is by no means short on post-apocalyptic wastelands to explore but unless a game comes out based on A Boy and His Dog comes out, none of them can claim to be based on one of the most influential pieces of Post-Apocalyptic media of the past 35 years. In this sense, Avalanche Studios’ Mad Max is an exciting licensed property in the game world and the prospect of playing another post-apocalyptic title, even amidst a market full of them, has only been sweetened by the most recent film in the Mad Max franchise: Fury Road. Given Avalanche’s mastery of creating exciting sandbox gameplay with ample opportunity for organic, play it your way hijinks, Mad Max seems poised to be this year’s Shadows of Mordor style sleeper hit.\n\nMuch like the films, Mad Max’s narrative is sparse but unlike the films, the supporting cast lacks the charisma to carry the events forward in a satisfying manner. Beginning with an overlong cutscene depicting Max’s clash with the game’s antagonist Scrotus. Their encounter ends with Scrotus suffering a major wound and Max stripped of his gear and left to wander in the desert. In typical video game fashion it’s up to Max to rebuild his car, re-acquire his gear and end Scrotus’ violent reign over the wasteland.\n\nWhile its narrative is certainly in the spirit of the films upon which it is based, the weak supporting cast and unfocused objective make for an underwhelming narrative experienced, especially when paired with 40 hours of gameplay. Early on, Max encounters a mechanic named Chumbucket who helps him rebuild his car and suggests the next wasteland leader to ask for assistance. Upon encountering each leader not much interaction occurs between them and Max. Their trust and tolerance is easily gained and there is very little narrative surrounding them. Each leader has a handful of side missions, referred to as wasteland missions in the game, but these amount to petty errands rather than building a plot around each character. The NPCs stand around like props exuding zero personality and failing to reflect the kind of society that each wasteland leader has built. In this sense, Mad Max takes the scenic route to its conclusion, introducing you to various people of interest but doing little to make your encounters with them seem essential to your fight against Scrotus. Amidst the endless diversions in each of the game’s regions, you soon forget why you are there and what your objective is. Aside from Chum’s crazed banter, there is little reason to pay attention.\n\nUpon receiving your bare bones vehicle and enlisting Chum’s assistance, Max’s journey begins proper and a routine is quickly established where players enter a territory, meet its leader, destroy Scrotus’ infrastructure in the area, obtain a vehicle upgrade that permits passage to a new territory and repeat. Mad Max relies on a series of mechanics familiar to those who have played open world games over the past five years. There are enemy strongholds to topple, weather balloons to utilize for reconnaissance and fast travel, loot caches to pillage for upgrade currency, races to partake in and convoys to smash. In addition to these activities there are special parts to be on the lookout for that allow max to upgrade the stronghold of each wasteland leader he encounters. Constructing these upgrades allow Max to replenish his supplies which would otherwise have to be scavenged. The problem is each stronghold requires the same upgrades and by the midway point, hunting down components for each stronghold feels like a chore. Likewise, once the allure of taking out the strongholds that dot each of the game’s regions grows tiresome after the novelty of their sometimes intricate designs ware off. These strongholds are in particular a point of frustration since in many ways they are some of the game’s most interesting set pieces but by being populated with the same handful of gimmicks and gameplay choices they grow dull long before the credits roll. Some of these strongholds are also home to bosses, none of which come close to living up to the eccentric antagonists of the films such as Toecutter, Humongus or Imortan Joe. Instead, expect to fight muscular men in gimp masks wielding polearms ad nauseam.\n\nFurther hampering the game’s mechanics is the mind numbingly dull combat lifted from the Arkham series which relies on counters and timed button presses. If you have better dexterity than a three toed sloth with rheumatoid arthritis, expect to yawn your way through the game’s uninspired enemies with barely a scratch. The combat system tries to spice things up with new abilities that Max can learn, melee weapons that break after a short period of time and finishing moves executed with shivs but due to the ubiquity of its design, combat simply doesn’t stand out.\n\nWhile it may seem that Mad Max is another throw away game based on a licensed property it does manage to redeem itself with engaging vehicular gameplay. Your car, The Magnum Opus, starts as nothing more than an engine on a chassis, but as you explore the wasteland you can locate new car bodies, and lower Scrotus’ influence over each region to unlock more upgrades. At first, taking control of your car is an irritation; it’s slow, handles poorly and tends to spin out easily but after a few upgrades the Magnum Opus becomes a speedy death machine allowing you to terrorize your foes. What’s more interesting is that the upgrades in each category can have a negative impact on other performance categories so having the heaviest bumper may allow you to deal major damage but it’s weight also makes the car slower. You can shove a massive engine in your ride but it’s going to negatively impact the vehicle’s handling. This makes it worthwhile to have all of the upgrades and swap between them when the situation calls for it. The visual and performance enhancing upgrades prove to be the perfect carrot on the stick to motivate players to complete some of the game’s more tedious activities. You can also unlock additional vehicles by driving captured enemy cars back to friendly strongholds or by winning races.\n\nUltimately, Mad Max’s gameplay falls short by not featuring any gameplay mechanics that give the game a unique identity. Most of the gameplay elements featured in Mad Max can be traced back to half a dozen other games that share the same mechanics—two of which are also published by Warner Brothers. It’s easy to run headlong into a convoy of eight cars, turn them into a scrap heap in less than a minute and reflect back on both Just Cause 2 and Fury Road… Where are the massive war rigs? Why can’t you hop aboard other cars? Shouldn’t taking out a convoy be something more than blowing up a few cars? Your interest in playing mad max will likely only last as long as your enthusiasm for driving around the wasteland in a four wheel drive rat rod leaving a trail of destruction. Mad Max is a case of competency over excellence and it doesn’t help that the open world action adventure game has usurped the third person cover based shooter as the go to game design template. This isn’t the sleeper hit it could have been but it isn’t exactly a game to ignore if you are a fan of Mad Max or open world action games.","October 28, 2015","true","38.5"," 58 of 76 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","58","76","0","2"

From the setting sun, to the raging sandstorm, to the colorful explosions, the visuals of the game is really well done. You might be expecting that everything is a bland hue of brown and you are mostly correct but they did splash some color in the game and I mean bright colors too. Blues, oranges, violets, are all there. Nothing is quite a giggling inducing as beating the crap out of a bright blue wasteland baddie.\n\nThe voice acting in the game is good. They actually got an authentic Australian to voice Max and not the movie type Australian like you're listening to Steve Erwin, you got a proper Australian accent going on.\n\nThe game has a huge map and there are tons to do. Destroying camps, scavening scraps, pulling down scarecrows, and more. There is the feeling of being a janitor as you sweep all the icons off the map. It can be tedious if you have been at it for a couple of hours.\n\nVehicular combat is were the game shines. It is violent, primal, and full of excitement. Your car is a veritable moving arsenal. The Magnum Opus (your car) is highly customizable. If you want a rolling fortress or a speeding bullet, you can configure it to your heart's content.\n\nThe game uses the same system as Batman and Shadow of Mordor. You can counter attacks with button prompts and mash the attack button to wade in a fight. If you are used to Avalanche's fighting system, you'll be right at home here. If you are looking for something else, you'll be disappointed. It's good but nothing innovative.\n\nThere were some (a lot) of people that were concerned about how well the game is optimized for PC users. Well, I'm glad to say that the game works wonderfully. Being that the game was developed in house rather than outsourcing the porting to another company ensured that the game is properly optimized though I feel that I should not have to talk about that because since when does proper optimization have to be a positive of a game? This should be the norm not an exemption.\n\nWith Metal Gear being released on the same day, is Mad Max worth it? I would say yes. I bought it for $30 USD so I think I'm getting my value's worth. If you are a fan of the Mad Max universe then I say play the game.\nIf you are new to the Australian wasteland, give it a try.\n\n","September 6, 2015","true","37.3"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","37","42","0","0"

You are left behind, half dead with nothing but your will of survival and your wish for revenge and the need to get your car, especially your V8 motor, back.\n\nThe world is divided into several territories, each with a dedicated person which owns it throughout their outpost. In the beginning, the presence of Scabrous Scrotus lackeys is very high and you can do several things to reduce their threat by demolition scarecrows, killing snipers which are guarding the territories, destroying car convoys and destroying or freeing strongholds of enemies.\n\nYour car is your best buddy here and feels like your own fortress which, after some time and upgrades, it actually becomes.\nBetter motorisation, better wheels, improved armor etc. Each of these does aso have an impact on your speed and handling. The better your protection, the slower you are and the harder your car is to handle.\n\nWhen on foot, it plays basically like every other third person brawler. Your fists are your weapon, punching your way through the enemies in combos, finishers and, if you need something stronger, your shotgun.\nYou can also upgrade your character, skill wise (getting more loot, better health etc.) and also item wise (a better jacket with more protection, an upgrade for your shotgun etc.).\n\nVisuals are pretty amazing (watch my screenshot, watch my screenshots! :D ), the lighting is pretty good, animations are fine, details are good, the textures could sometimes be better but the details and the particle effects, especially the explosions, are superb.\n\nOverall the game is oozing post-apocalypse out of every pore. You can nearly taste and feel the dust and the dirt, the desolation and despair in this world is felt in every corner, survival of the fittest is the motto.\n\nThe story itself is pretty much already told, Max is fighting his way through the wastelands, to get back his car/V8 Motor and is aided by Chumbucket, an Outcast, who will built you gladly his "Magnum Opus", a new car which will be better than everything else. He also thinks you are some godly/angelic entity from his dreams..or something. He is weird but fun and will sit on the back of your car, providing you with repair skills and he will also shoot explosives at other cars or use the harpoon to tear down structures in your way.\n\nI had a lot of fun with the game and would blindly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the setting or a good third person action game with a lot of driving.\nBut it also has it's downsides, sidemission etc. do get repetitive and the wastelands aren't filled with anything else than the same objectives over and over again, but if you can live with that, i think you will have a blast with the game :)","September 8, 2015","true","60.5"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","35","41","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/234140/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 5 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","In many ways 2015 was the year of Mad Max. We got the excellent film Mad Max Fury Road earlier in the year closer to May, and in September we recieved Mad Max 2015 by Avalanche studios. The devs behind the Just Cause series.\n\nWhen I first heard about this game I hated the idea of it. I didn't really think in the era of Fallout that we really needed another derivative post apocalyptic open world game. When I heard Mel Gibson wasn't involved at all that really made me less interested in it. Then after Fury Road I relaxed to the idea of more Mad Max. And I was surprised by how much I liked this game and what it set out to accomplish.\n\nIn many ways the Mad Max Film series is almost the perfect concept for an open world driving game. You have a post apocalyptic sandbox filled with hostile enemy raiders. You have a core driving experience with car combat and upgrade trees to customize your hot rod. What I was surprised by the most with this game in particular was how much detail was paid attention to. There are numerous little callbacks to the previous films, and the stylistic decisions they made with the game were spot on.\n\nThe wasteland of Mad Max was perfectly nailed. Unlike the Fallout games, the world feels very handcrafted. Nothing feels copy-pasted and throwaway locations like enemy outposts all look scenic enough to take a dozen screenshots of. The game also boasts an impressive draw distance and it runs extremely well on PC. The gameplay is solid enough. With car combat being a highlight in the game. There's a very noticeable focus on scavanging. Your car requires gasoline to keep going, you require water inorder to heal yourself. You only ever find individual shells for your gun and can only carry a handful at one time. I really do feel more like a vulture picking at a corpse of a dead world than a super soldier like in most modern sandbox games.\n\nBut with all that said, the game isn't for everyone. I feel alone when I say this but the things people dislike about this game, like the heavy focus on sidequests, the general minimalistic storyline and lack of gunplay are things that appealed to me about it. I actually think the laundry list Assassin's Creed formula benefits this game greatly. Your grand objective in this game isn't a pointless revenge story or a pointless revolutionary story. You spend the vast majority of this game looking for ways to upgrade your car. I like how the game focuses on that rather than a more generic storyline and mission structure.\n\nAs I said the game isn't for everyone. If you're not a fan of the Mad Max films and you get turned off by a heavy focus on sidequests with a game I'd suggest looking elsewhere. I'd wager less than 10% of Mad Max is actual story content and if that sounds like a bad thing, you will probably find a lot of this game very tedious.","January 4","true","12.3"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","26","27","0","0"

From that point, Max's begins a journey in which he helps different settlements to fight back and get revenge against Scrotum.\nThe story isn't all that complex, and the characters are mostly one dimensional, however they are all peculiar and wacky, with Chumbucket being one of the best video game sidekicks out there, always giving you advice on what to do.\nSimilarly to the movies, most of the Wasteland's backstory is told visually: you will see collapsed bridges, dry docks, buried cities. If you are looking for something more complex, you won't find it here.\n\nGRAPHICSFor almost every PC users, this game performs extremly well: Avalanche optimised the engine to make it work at rock solid 60fps, also thanks to the presence of the wasteland. If you are playing the game at the highest or lowest settings, the environment is beautiful. Every enemy camp you explore feels unique, every faction has different vehicles and enemies and there are enough landmarks to make you understand where you are going without always checking the mini-map.\nThe particle effects are also amazing: the explosions are pure poetry, and the sandstorms manage to make your jaw drop the first time you encounter them. Hardly have I ever played a game about a post-apocalyptic future that looks so good.\n\nGAMEPLAYThere are two types of combat: hand-to-hand and vehicular.\nHand-to-hand combat is pretty similar to the Arkham games, however it feels different: while Batman is more agile and can parry almost every attack, Max is heavier and stronger. While doing an heavy attack, you can't parry whose attacking you. You can also pick up enemy weapons, or use your shotgun for one-hit kills.\nVehicular combat is where the gameplay shines the most: since the game is set in a wasteland, you will hardly ever crush into a rock or a wall. You can use a grappling hook to pull parts of the car, from the wheels to the driver himself, as well as revealing the gas tank to blow it up with a well-aimed shot. Whenever you aim, the game enters slow-motion, making things easier and less frustrating.\nThe more you play, the more you can customize Max and the Mangum Ops: from new jackets, hairstyles, ammo belts and moves for the former, to new weapons, engines and armor for the latter. If you enjoy customization, there is a lot of it here. You can also use enemy cars to infiltrate camps without alerting anyone, adding a bit of strategy to the game.\nHowever, the open world missions can become repetitive pretty fast: you can destroy scarecrows, capture camps, explore locations for scrap, use air baloons to scout the areas and destory enemy convoys. Sometimes you will have the task to go somewhere and free some prisoners, but other than that there isn't much variety. However, the combat always keeps things interesting, especially when fighting bosses or destorying convoys.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game isn't particularly challenging: the camps feature many checkpoints and water stashes to recover health, and the car fights can be won by just pulling the driver out of the vehicle. Still, some missions are harder than others, and the bosses that you fight require more thinking than button mashing, so it all balances out.\n\nSOUNDYes, Mad Max is voiced by an Australian. And he acts very well. All the other characters are very cartoony, just like in the movies, and Chumbucket's voice actor does a great job at being funny and never annoying. However, the soundtrack is pretty mediocre, especially compared to the one in this year's Fury Road. But the sound effects make up for it: every punch you throw, every explosion you witness pack enough punch to satisfy the violent spirit inside every one of us.\n\nREPLAYABILITYAs with most open world games, you get quite a lot of content here: between completing all the missions and destorying the enemy outposts, there are many objectives that will keep you entertained for most of the game. You can also try your luck by exploring the Great Nothing, a infinitely big desert with ton of scrap to take.\n\nOverall, fans of the movie franchise and open world games will spend a lot of time playing this game thanks to its solid combat, beautiful wasteland and great performance. If you are on the fence, I recommend waiting for a sale.\n\nStory: 7.5\nGraphics: 9\nGameplay: 8.5\nChallenge: 7.5\nSound: 7.5\nReplayability: 8.5\n\nENJOYMENT: 8.5\nFRUSTRATION: 5\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","September 6, 2015","true","10.7"," 55 of 77 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","55","77","3","2"

Only a skilled and fearless warrior with a knack for driving can survive this ordeal. His name is Max, Mad Max!\n\nYou will be playing Mad Max (no kidding), a tough guy on a mission to rebuild a new and slightly modified motor vehicle called the “Magnum Opus!” You will be assisted by "Chumbucket", a brilliant but strange mechanic who wears an unusual jewellery piece, a spark plug necklace!\n\nThis game really reminds me of a mixture of a few games:  Shadow of Mordor for how the map is laid out, and instead of climbing towers to view an area, you take a trip on a small hot air balloon to pin point locations on the map; and the Batman series for the combat system. Great story line with well-designed missions but if you are like me you will go through the entire area to pick up collectibles, scrap metal and project parts, or you could even go racing - MARVELLOUS!!\n\nMake sure to collect all the scraps you can find so you will be able to add on features to your “Magnum Opus” but also equip your favourite warrior with well needed upgrades. Upon achieving missions and challenges, you will be rewarded with tokens which you can use by having a friendly one-on-one chat with Griffa. He will use his magic to put you to sleep and then you will be able to increase Mad Max abilities.\n\nIn some locations, you will find project parts. These parts can be used to upgrade strongholds so when you stop there, it will regenerate your health, fuel and ammunitions.\n\nLet’s be  honest, Mad Max is absolutely magic in regards to graphics and the game runs beautifully well. Great voice over, the controls are smooth and easy to master.

I expected a lot from the game after watching it's trailers, and I was not disappointed.\n\n\nPros:\nAbsolutely amazing vehicular combat, completely surpassing my expectations!\n\nReally fun ground combat! As a lot of you probably know the combat is very similar to the Arkham series of games, and that's definitely not a bad thing. You feel like the badass wanderer that Max has always been.\n\nNice graphics! On max graphics the game looks beautiful, though my computer can't run it at max quality without a significant drop in framerate.\n\nGood voice actors! While some of the characters feel pretty lackluster, the majority of the characters are really brought to life by the actors.\n\nPowerful Story! I know some people might disagree with me here, as this game definitely isn't "The Last of Us". However, the game does a fantastic job of capturing the old story of Max regaining his humanity in the wasteland.\n\nBig (and beautiful) World! The world is big with plenty to explore, as well as tons of enemies to take down.\n\nCons:\n\nThe game can become somewhat repetitive as you grind away at clearing minefields or carrying gas can around trying to blow up every last transfer tank. However the game keeps things interesting with plenty of combat during these events so this isn't that large of a complaint.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nReally this is just a great game, and I highly recommend buying it whether you're a fan of the series or are just looking for a good open-world game.","November 13, 2015","true","42.8"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","24","26","2","0"

Bitterness prevails above all of it. Still, this one is the helluva fun ride, all the way down the road.\n\nYou can finish it in 10-20 hours, going straight through quests, but that would be a waste of time, from my point of view.\nLike I said, the game has bitter taste, and the story line will not give you satisfaction after final screen. So I beg you: play it like open-world adventure. Don't mind major quests, until you really have to. Just get yourself a decent car, and go for exploring this land. Eroded, crumbled to dust, but still striving for survival.\n\nSome time ago, I was really fond to Far Cry 2, which was baptized as horrid and bleak by the majority of players. But I found in Far Cry 2 one thing, for it can be loved: the driving part. Here in Mad Max, the same feeling of driving through wasteland, where there are no actual roads, only directions, and it goes 10 times better than in Far Cry 2!\n\nLet's settle pro and contra:\n\n+ Graphics and optimization are very good parts. All is smooth and fine with that.\n\n+ Driving is the selling point. It is one of a kind experience, I suggest everyone to get at least some of it.\n\n+ Fighting part is very similar to Batman's games, or Sleeping Dogs - strike and strong strike, parry&reposte, combo... It goes fine, for the most time. Although some moves Max showing are certainly not fit the realistic setting the game's narrative assuming. But the same can be said about the whole game: the realism is here, but steps away to make some emotions brighter. Still, after about 200-300 broken jaws, it is finally not that fun, as with Bats or Wei Shen... The Shadow of Mordor gives much more contentment, than Mad Max, at this point.\n\n+ The gameplay main features certainly looks familiar. Fighting from Batman, scrap collecting and gear tuning from Tomb Raider... you can proceed with the list, but here's the main thing: it was blended alright. Unlike Watch Dogs, Mad Max gameplay is not seems like Frankenstein style. All things there at right places, so the final expression the game gives is pure. You're getting a fresh new game out of long-known features. A good deal.\n\n- The only strong point I have against this game is amusingly overall accolade to Death. All those skulls, achievement for eating maggots nesting in the rotting corpses... All that gore is an over-act, an over-kill and exaggeration of the Apocalypse theme. I felt disgust sometimes during playtime. So I'm certainly not recommending Mad Max to kids or to sensitive persons.\n\n- The game is open-world, but it contains almost none of any sandbox experience. After you clear the given territory from the enemy presence, there are absolutely nothing to do. So you can't play this game by hundreds of hours, like Skyrim. Unless you really like driving in wastelands over all other gaming experience, of course.\n\nIn sum: Mad Max is pure and solid action game. Very brutal, and quite entertaining for some time. You ride a death car, right in the middle with the real world and hell. And while your good deeds somehow fixing something around you, your hero goes deeper and deeper on the dark side. Very nice and very grim adventure in the post-apocalypse crack of world we used to know. Give it a go, but leave any hopes before entering.\n\nI mark it as 7.9/10. I like it very much, but it hurts something inside me. Let's just pray we'll never see this dream come true.","December 26, 2015","true","134.8"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","31","38","0","10"

Traffic is still murder though.\n\n\nBut seriously: highly recommended. I couldn't stop playing this game.\n\nIt's a sandbox game with a whole lot of sand, a great atmosphere, visual design taken straight of Fury Road and made by fans of the whole series or at least people who really documented themselves, with lots of details and easter eggs about the three first movies. As a fan of the Mad Max universe myself, I had a blast.\n\nHowever, just as in a real sandbox, it's mostly up to you to make your own fun. The story is a bit weak, and while there are a ton of locations (over 250 I think), all of them unique, all you do is drive and fight, either in a vehicle or on foot with a Batman Arkham clone system which is very brutal and satisfying and offers quite a bit of different possibilities once you've unlocked skills. You can upgrade your vehicle to make it tougher and meaner, get a few weapons for your car and unlock fighting skills for Max, but the core experience stays the same. If that appeals to you and you like to explore every nook and cranny in a game to find stuff (it's always scrap, but you need it for everything), go right in. If you need to be poked every five minutes by narrative to stay interested, it isn't the game for you.\n\nThere a over 16'000 reviews already, so there isn't much I could say that you can't find elsewhere. I'm just going to say "watch the trailer", for once it isn't just an empty cinematics showcase filled with buzzwords but it shows you most of the gameplay and really shows you the game and what to expect.\n\nDisclaimer: I am a fan of the Mad Max universe since The Road Warrior, back in the days where there was no videogames and where it was the only post-apocalyptic experience around, so I'm probably biaised.\n\n","May 6","true","156.9"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","86","24","28","20","4"

Fast travel in this game is like the less important thing to be use, drove for a miles just to pick up some goods, It more enjoyable than to use the fast travel.\n\nAlso detail are one of the thing that make this game to be great, you can actually lost in desert here and everywhere you go it really different to another place that you just visited, fire from expolsive add on this too, it look so real that I don't take Max to walk close to it, even the cave that only had the one way in and out, would take you around 3 minute to get you out from there.

Pick it up for $19.99 or less.\n\nMad Max is a game attempt by Avalanche to leverage the legendary narrative from Kennedy-Miller with the aim of creating an action-packed open-world style game with vehicular combat and Arkham-style fisticuffs.\n\nWhile the game is entertaining enough - at least for a while - it gradually becomes apparent that Avalanche really don't grasp the reasons behind the design choices of other games and the importance of building complete systems rather than facades.\n\nAnd this is the essential problem.  Most of the wasteland's life is a simulacrum of reality where the seams are very much showing.  Now some might not regard this as problematic, however I'd argue they're missing the point.\n\nTake, for example, the convoy system.  Now taking down convoys is one of the more thrilling aspects of the game and many consider this a high point.  However standing back and taking a look at it reveals the completely shallow nature of this experience.  The convoys - the narrative tells us over and over again - are an essential component of the primary antagonist's war machine.  They take crude oil to Gastown and return with fuel for the outposts.\n\nThe only problem with this is that every single convoy travels in a giant circle making no stops along the way.  The gameplay experience directly contradicts the narrative.  And worse still, the player's reward for taking out a convoy is a shiny hood ornament (which buffs the player's car in an indeterminate fashion) and the reduction of "threat" - a completely nebulous concept which supposedly determines the probability of your wasteland travels being disturbed by howling madmen screaming for your blood.  (Basically your convoy efforts affect a multiplier for Avalanche's random number generator.)\n\nThis - and this is my primary impression of many aspects of this game - is a lost opportunity.  Gameplay is about choices and in particular, it's about allowing the player to make smart, innovative and creative choices.\n\nThe convoy system COULD have been a network of convoys with real impacts upon the other systems of the game.  Convoy routes could be determined through observation and/or intelligence-gathering.  With that, the player would also need an understanding of the risks and rewards of attacking a given convoy.  Convoy A might impact fuel availability for roving war patrols in a specific area - thus reducing their ability to chase you - whereas convoy B might starve a fortress of the fuel necessary for defenses.\n\nAll of a sudden, you elevate the convoy system from being a purely repetitive experience to one with strategic implications.  You enable the player to plan at a higher level and - more importantly - you make the convoy experience start to matter more in the strategic and narrative context of the game.\n\nThe base system suffers from similar facile gameplay systems.  Perimeter base defenses consist of snipers, a wall of fire, thunderstick launchers and molotov launchers.  Each of these has problems.\n\nA) Snipers DO NOT EXIST until you get within a specific range at which point they pop into being and conveniently shine a blue light allowing you to pinpoint them with minimal effort.  The color of the light changes depending on how close they are to firing upon you.  Now while sniping is a fun activity, this particular system requires minimal skill.  In the entire game, not once did a sniper ever come close to killing me.  I got hit about 5 times.\n\nB) The wall of fire requires you to hunt for the attached tank and destroy it.  Not very challengine and adds little to the experience.\n\nC) Molotov launchers can be taken out with sniper fire.  Thunderstick launchers cannot.\n\nAll of these elements detect the player whenever he moves within a specific radius.  Irrespective of line of sight.  Thus, while bases often have secret entrances, these entrances often require you to disable the perimeter defenses anyway and all you end up doing is bypassing the main gate.  (There are exceptions but these are few and far between).\n\nOnce inside, the player has no option for stealth and pretty much has to plow through the place with his fists while simultaneously searching for completely optional and zero-impact-upon-the-world collectibles.  (One of which is scrap, one is historical oddities and the other is antagonist insignia).  Sure, Max can always use more scrap - it IS the currency of the world, after all - but is he really going to care about insignia or postcards?  Those last two are pointless busy work - and I became thoroughly sick of it.\n\nEssentially, the promise of an open-world environment is undermined by incredibly linear - not to mention repetitious - design.  And while I do have to give the level designers props for inventive use of 3D space - the levels are fairly well constructed - and kudos to whomever came up with the idea for the War Crier, the base clearing mechanic itself is a simplistic version of what it could have been.\n\nThe system for building projects inside strongholds initially seems cool - until you realise it's just a bunch of fetch quests which you repeat four times (once for each stronghold).  The idea is good but, once again, the implementation is facile and the repetition is lazy and unforgivable.\n\nThe minefields - oh dear God, the minefields.  This is absolutely the worst part of the game.  Not only must you hope to stumble across these (literally, there's no other way of finding them), but then you have to ditch your car for a buggy with zero offensive capability in order to defuse the mines.  Apparently the mine-detecting dog you've stumbled across is unable to detect mines unless he's in a buggy.  Or something.  The rationale for this was never made clear, but it - like all aspects of the minefield clearing - was intolerably stupid and inconceivably boring.\n\nThe scarecrows are more threat-reduction devices, present no challenge and require nothing more from the player than the ability to aim a harpoon in slow motion or crash effectively.  The balloons are good enough, but far too slow and the vague attempts to inject puzzle mechanics (by requiring the player to find fuel or navigate his way to a particular point) are trite and uninspired.\n\nThe wasteland encounters were largely a waste.  The intel encounters at least brought a little more depth to the base destruction system, but not much.  The others were optional and merely required the player to show up and say hello.  Boring, repetitious and unnecessary.\n\nThe long-term encounters (buzzard hole destruction, jumps, catapult destruction and gas valves) were standard open world fare but with a worthless payoff.  Ways to waste the player's time but with zero narrative payoff and an almost insulting player reward.\n\nThe voice-acting runs the gamut from good (Griffa and the stronghold leaders) to mediocre (Max himself) to the downright awful (every other Australian in the game).  In particular the female Australian voice-artist is dire.  She's not helped by the god-awful scripts she's been given, but she has no talent for voice-acting whatsoever and I cringed every time I heard her.  (I'm Australian, so more than familiar with our accent).\n\nSummed up, Mad Max is a game of disparate experiences with elements of fun, but which fails to come together into a coherent and enjoyable whole.  It is primarily a catalogue of lost opportunities with the main issue being a lack of depth.  It's this lack of depth which undermines the open world experience.\n\nGame played to completion, threat reduced to 0 in all areas.   Recommended buy for less than $20.  Ripper DLC has no impact on the game.\n\nScore: 6/10.","September 10, 2015","false","105.2"," 308 of 521 people (59%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","59","308","521","15","43"

About 12 hours in I got a solid feel of the overall game.\nThe important thing to know about Mad Max is that it's fun. And that's the whole point.\nIt is far from perfect, lacks in many departements but it also has a lot of positives which make it a good enjoyable game.\nThe over the top action makes you want to play a little bit more all the time.\nCompletists will have their hands full.\nThe game focuses a lot on driving and does it well, there are so many upgrades for your vehicles, and so many of them.\nThe on-foot action is also good, fighting is a little simple (like batman) but its fun nevertheless. I do wish there was more weapons and customizations for them. It is very thin in that department, and you barely find any ammo in the game so you practically never use your shotgun.\nThe acting is good but the story is week. You don't feel like you're switching gears between the main story and side missions, they both feel the same, so you don't get that change of pace that breaks the monotony of tasks.\nThe game feels a little sand boxy but that doesn't take away form the fun of playing it.\nThe worst issue of the game is the character animation and movement. It's horribly done. The jumping in particular is the worst I've seen in any game the last 10 years, super clumsy. And the falling animation feels like you're a floating leaf.\nThey really needed to work on that departement to make max feel heavier, with the ability to jump and grab etc. All of which aren't there and hurt the gameplay.\n\n\nThe Positives:\n\n-Great Atmosphere overall. Enviroments are spot on and so is music.\n-Fun gameplay, fighting, driving and effects are satisfying.\n-Tons of upgrades and mods.\n-Lots of things to do.\n-Pretty good acting.\n\nThe Negatives:\n\n-Weekish Story. Even main mission feels like a side mission.\n-A Little repetitive at times.\n-Abysmal character movement for a current gen game. Jumping in particular is terrible.\n\nStill, you will get a good 60-70hr atmospheric fun and thrilling gameplay out of this game.\nI'm enjoying it to the Max :)","September 17, 2015","true","69.0"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","0"

Beautiful and fun, but once you've played for a while the game gets repetitive. A good example are the "Top Dog" camps throughout the wasteland, where you'll end up in a boss fight with the "Top Dog", the leader of the camp, which unfortunately looks and acts the exact same way as the rest of the "Top Dogs" you'll encounter.\n\nMain story is OK, although nothing special and pretty predictable.\n\nMy suggestion? Do some side missions, explore as much as you want, finish the main story, and when you feel like you've seen all there is to see you can be happy with the game and stop playing it. I should've probably stopped after 20 or so hours just to not get tired of the repetitiveness, but here I am with +50 hours played.","September 5, 2015","true","55.6"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","0"

There aren't quest items that look brand new)\nSounds (from the wind to the guns to the engine its great)\nItem rarity (food and water, which replenish health faster, are very hard to find. Gas is also a moderately rare commodity\n\nCons:\n\nThe sand storm sound is like earrape and you can't choose to only lower that sound.\nNo difficulty levels (combat is easy most of the time)\nNitro feels almost useless when you first get it\nNo stealth (A stealth option would have been fun. I would rather not run head on into 10 guys in a camp)\nAccidental cutscene skipping (when a cutscene is triggered the game says press "E" to skip... That's a lie... if you click anything at all it skips the cutscene. Because of this I've missed a few cutscenes D:)\n\n\nOverall the Pros outweigh the cons quite a bit!

Mad Max is a third person, action game set in an open world enviroment, based on the Mad Max film series. It was released on September 1st 2015 on PC, PS4 and XBOX One. You can explore plenty of deserts, canyons, wreckage, tunnels, hills. In the story, Max's car was stolen in wasteland by Scrotus. Then Scrotus beaten and threw him into Chumbucket's region. After few minutes Max wakes up and found Chumbucket. Then Chumbucket helps Max to build a war machine for Wasteland War. After all this, journey begins.\n\nMad Max featured with massive open world map. We can do several things in Wasteland. Like terminating Snipers, Camps, Stop Dogs, Scarecrows. Even we can play Death Run races. Like Time Bomb and Finish The Line. We can earn cars by winning Death Run races as reward. There are many types of cars available for our collection.\n\nWe can make better and proper progress if we play this game accordingly. There are quiet numbers of Side missions. We can earn great numbers of scraps for upgrading Magnum Opus, Max, Chumbucket, Weapons.\n\nIf you wants to upgrade everything then you have to increase your legend rank.  Making progress of legend rank will unlock new upgrades for Max. Terminating Camps, Convoys, Minefields, Snipers, Scarecrows will reduce threat meter to 0 from 5. This will also unlock new upgrades for Magnum Opus.\n\nPros :::\n1. Realistic Graphics Quality.\n2. There are few things to do in Wasteland.\n3. Plenty of Side missions.\n4. The fuel system and filling my cane with water is really amazing way for better focus in this game.\n5. This game featured with massive open world map.\n6. Highly Optimized Game. I am really impressed with it's optimization.\n7. Story feels really epic and emotional.\n8. Really a great style of combat with Fury Killing Ability.\n9. Driving Magnum Opus feels really comfortable.\n10. We can upgrade Max, Magnum Opus, Chumbucket, Strongholds.\n\nYou can rebuild strongholds by Project Parts. You have to collect Project Parts after tracking them on your map. Like if you build Scrap Crew then this Crew will collect scraps from all over the Wasteland while your game is off. But you must need Internet Connection for collecting those scraps from Crew.\n\nYou can play this game better if you upgrade your harpoon to level 6 which is max level of harpoon weapon. Also try to upgrade Max's Knucles and Jacket for his better defence.There are many types of enemy out there with upgraded in highly power. So you need best defence for Max that he can fight longer and defeat them.\n\nThis game is highly optimized. You can play this game smoothly with low mode settings in your low config. If you got Intel Core i5 with 8GB RAM and 2GB GDDR5 then you can explore Wasteland in Ultra High Settings.\n\nLet me tell you that i am the 1st finisher of this game in Bangladesh. I got a best name for this game. Name's The Rising Legend. I found a best game after many years later. Like Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed Revelations, Life is Strange, Tomb Raider, Metro Last Light, Deus-Ex Human Revolution. Really it's a amazing game with epic and emotional ending. The ending of this game made me so much weak. The price of this game worth it highly. So that's what i want to say about this game.","September 14, 2015","true","126.3"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","29","38","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ramsden/recommended/234140/","ramsden","Insidia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ramsden/","309 products in account","I'll try and keep it as much straight to the point as possible. First off it's not tied directly to the films as such, you are not Tom Hardy's Max and you are not Mel Gibson's Max so think of the game maybe seperate from the films, it is it's own thing here.\n\nBest part so far, it works! It's not broken, there are no game breaking bugs. In 10 hours of game play I have had zero crashes or glitches. On top of that I'm about to do all this fully optimized with a 980 GTX. However do remember this will make your GPU work, so you may want something like msi afterburner to get those fans going faster to keep it cool. The first time around my card jump from 30c to 60c and that's without water cooling. I do have the water block for it I've just been too lazy to put it in.\n\nSo what's the game like? The best way to think about it is, take concepts from Far Cry , Assassins Creed, Borderlands Humour and a Batman Arkham style combat system then this is what you get. And I've gotta say so far it's a success.\n\nIs it perfect? Of course it isn't, some would argue any game is perfect. For one I personally feel my controls are restricted for an open world, I want to be able to walk and run. I also want to be able to jump over and around things like you can in Assasins Creed and the Witcher but at times you can't jump over simple obsticles because you wern't meant to. But still, it's pretty minor and by no means a reason to give it a negative review.\n\nI say Far Cry and Assasins Creed because in this open world instead of using radio watch towers and high pirches you have hot air balloons that go up and you use binoculars to scower the area yourself. If you rush it, you could miss unlocking something on the map. And Batman style combat, well because that's what it is. Fun, quick and easy to learn and really awesome to look at especially with finishers and other moves you can pick up as you upgrade Max along the way.\n\nAmmo is scarce as it should be, it's a post apocolyptic world and there isn't exactly gun factories about so you have to concerve your ammo and use it wisely. If you take your time in the game and go to all the scavaging areas on the map then you'll come across plenty of ammo, and as long as you're not a ♥♥♥♥ it won't be a serious issue. You can upgrade certain perks by finding this myterious traveller following you about (looks familiar to!) who gives you upgrades and you can increase the amount of ammo you find amongst other things.\n\nOne nice touch here is the levellng system. Think of Max as having a bunch of ranks. You start off at the bottom and you level lets say 10 times by completing various tasks and goals such as killing x amount of bad guys this way or that way, or running so many people over. As you rank up you get to unlock more and more powerful upgrades. Naturally the final rank is "Road Warrior".\n\nThe actual map is interesting, it's done in such a way where it would be really easy to knock out expansions and make additions, it could never end if they didn't want it to. Also it is quite large, after a few hours in the game you'll quickly realise there's a lot of things to do.\n\nYou get to upgrade your car, you can change Max's appearence a little. There's also sections with bios for all the charactors you mean and all the badguys and vehicles you can collect and use (there appears to be quite a few).\n\nAt the moment I'm finding the game fairly easy, I wasn't presented with a difficulty mode and considering I've completed the Far Cry, Assasin's Creed (well Black Flag, Rogue) and the Batman series i've found this pretty easy to get the hang of and quickly learnt what was what. Whether I'll unlock a harder mode when I complete it remains to be seen.\n\nAll in all, yes. Right now I'd say the game is worth the money (just). Let's hope we get some decent DLC for this to keep it alive for a number of years at least as it has potential to do so.","September 1, 2015","true","52.6"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","2"

Melee combat is very satisfying, on the same level as the Batman Arkham series. Also there is a Capture Mode that lets you use the camera as an independent entity - the photo mode can be operated by one person, while the video mode requires the camera to be operated by another controller (by extension, another person). Oh, and flawless graphics optimization. My i7 3770k with a Radeon HD 7970 can run this sucker at maximum graphics with absolutely zero hitches.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=513336706\nCons: No "New Game Plus" feature, can't carry over your earned upgrades to a new game (without story mode), any enemy content you clear is not repeatable. Basically, you can't keep repeating the stuff you love to do, and end up getting stuck with a dwindling pool of content to chew on as you build up the Magnum Opus.\n\nAs of this writing, I've cleared just about all strongholds, all scarecrows, and all convoys. All I have left to do now is... *shudder*...the minefields. Such annoying, worthless gameplay that serves little more than to drive you insane with Dinky Di's incessant baying.\n\nAvalanche, a few more months of work on this game - and maybe a little bit of prudent forethought - would have resulted in a much more solid product.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who has no problem with a one-and-done execution on game design philosophy, as opposed to the heavily replayable content seen in many other open-world games.\n\nUPDATE, EXTENDED REVIEW EDITION: Just completed all "hostile" content (convoys, minefields, etc) and all Wasteland missions, got all territories to Threat Level 0. After just 32 hours of game time.\n\nWhat follows is my final impression of the game.\n\nThe game is an excellent foundational game, but lacks the long term stamina to make this a game for people to keep coming back to even after they've beaten it. When you first step into the World of Mad Max, it feels very authentic, and the gameplay is top notch.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=513398991\nHowever, after you get through the majority of the content, it's as if the air has been let out of its tires. You don't encounter enemies as often, and you don't get to have a lot of fights unless you decide to go scavenging a lot (which is pointless after you've completed all the Stronghold Projects). Enemy encounters on the road, after all the convoys have been defeated, amount to just random roving war bands and the occasional parked WarBoy vehicle by the roadside.\n\nIf Avalanche had implemented a type of New Game Plus feature that would allow the game's world map to regularly repopulate captured bases and defeated convoys with respawned enemy encounters, then the game wouldn't feel as empty at the end.\n\nIn the current game design of Mad Max, as I've said before, Avalanche seems to have unintentionally turned the game into a "One-And-Done" game experience, rather than focusing their design philosophy on repeatable game content to ensure high replay value.\n\nWhy do you think games like Grand Theft Auto 5 is popular? Because it's got plenty of content for you to chew on, and it's repeatable. Mad Max lacks this entirely.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=513428415\nIn the end, Mad Max is a game with a great introduction for new players, and a fun amount of content, but it quickly becomes a very painfully average game that offers no reason for you to bother coming back once you've beaten the content.\n\nIt's also very short for a $60 game, considering that I've beaten the vast majority of its content in just 31 hours. This game in its current state is NOT worth $60. I would peg it at $30.\n\nEven after all its shortcomings, if you're out for an authentic Mad Max experience, this game is recommended. Just wait for a Steam Sale that slashes it by 50%.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for a game that will continue to entertain you long after you've beaten all the content in it, you are going to be sorely disappointed, and I would recommend that you look for a different game.\n\nP.S. For those wondering: The War Rigs from Fury Road only make an appearance in this game in the form of a junked ride inside a tunnel. There are no actual driveable War Rigs.\n\nP.P.S. Let's be honest, if you are on a monthly gaming budget, and plan on spending $60 on a game, spend it on Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. It did release at around the same time as Mad Max, the difference is that MGSV has much better entertainment value for your money.","September 5, 2015","true","75.5"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","20","24","0","0"

Although WB are getting a lot of hate for abandoning Batman: Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X on PC, this game is not the case! Avalanche Studios optimalised the game for PC perfectly!\n\nWhat surprises you for the first time immediately, is the game world. It's not as big as in Just Cause games, but that doesn't matter, it's still huge. You'll be able to explore through the wastelands, see all 50 shades of sand, kill many mad warriors meanwhile and collect tons of scrap.\n\nScrap is the resource (or the currency) that is used in Mad Max for everything - you upgrade your weapons, your car or even Max's clothes with scrap. And there's plenty of upgrades for everything, so if you don't plan to get 100% achievements, you won't even unlock every upgrade the game offers. But the scrap isn't the only thing you need for unlocking the upgrades, most of advanced ones also require completing a specific mission or a simple task, like: Lower the antagonist's (Scabrous Scrotus) influence in area by taking over his camps or destroying his scarecrows (pylons that should let people around know who rules in the wasteland).\n\nWhile you can have about 5 basic car constructions (upgradable in any way you want) there are many more vehicles in the game, and you can control all of those! You'll find use for them in racing (death runs) that offers few types of races.\n\nThe combat is similar to Batman Arkham series, with many similar animations (punching, kicking and jumping groups of enemies) and practically same controls. You mash the left button for attack and when anyone in the enemy group attacks you, you have to parry the attack with right button. With exception for knife attacks and finishing moves, that's all. Anyway, it's not any significantly hard and it's fun.\n\nWhat's also a great pro of the game is the attention for details that aren't mentioned much when people talk around the game. There's a specific weather (random) event that'll make you impressed, but I don't want to spoil the details. Through the world you'll explore, you'll be finding photos of the old world (before the sandpocalypse), usually with something written on the back side. Those lead you (and the Max) to thinking about what in the game world is already lost.\n\nThe story is not bad for a game based primarly around combat, racing and exploring, it even tries to play with your emotions. But it'll most probably fail, because Max is stonehearted, so you'll get over all bad events like it was nothing. There's few really interesting characters that have interesting backstory, but there's also characters that you meet without any proper explanation of sympathies.\n\nI think that every player will be really excited to explore everything in the beginning, every small camp with scrap. But that doesn't last forever and most players will later find the "breaking point" where they found exploring being too much repetitive, leading to sticking just with the main story missions (they'll require you to do some regular exploring few times anyway).\n\nThe content recycling in the game (repeating enemies, camps etc.) is made delicately, with exception for one thing that ended up pretty bad - the bossfight(s). There are many bossfights in the game (especially for the side exploring - beating the Top Dogs) but they all are the same, the bosses even still use the same weapon! Only thing that changes is the arena where they fight and number of other NPCs that spawn around to help the boss.\n\nThe world of Mad Max has a day/night cycle, which is great but feels half-baked with the fact that you can't rest until specific part of the day comes. As there are few missions that requires to do them at night, you might end up having to do something else for about 90 minutes, while waiting for night.\n\nIn the end, I was really entertained for more than 20 hours thanks to Mad Max. As a current AAA game I got enough satisfaction out of it and even though I have not found motivation to complete everything that's not mandatory in the game, I still think it's a great game and definitely deserves my recommendation.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 28","true","28.2"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

It does so much more than most games and is obviously lovingly crafted.\n\nFrom a story perspective it's there and it's in perfect quantity. You can rush through the story if you want and have a nice compact experience, or you could play for 15 hours after you get done with the intro not touching the story at all and just focus on clearing camps, taking out snipers, taking down scarecrows, clearing minefields, searching for scrap, taking out a convoy, or upgrading a fortress to its completion before you decide to take on another mission. The ending while I can imagine it being divisive is my favorite since Red Dead Redemption. I won't spoil it for you but I will advise you giving it some time to sit with you and reflect on how fitting it is.\n\nTouching a bit more on those optional objectives. I've heard complaints about the grindy aspect of it, and I will admit that if you don't enjoy a grind it may be a bit tedious for you. I am the kind of gamer though that enjoys a nice solid grind with a reward at the end. When I completely lowered the threat down in someone's territory I felt accomplished, I had a much faster and more dangerous vehicle, and my Max had gotten much better as well.\n\nVisually the game is gorgeous. To me the beauty of the Mad Max movies (particularly The Road Warrior and Fury Road) is the contrast between the deep blue sky and the browns/oranges of the desert wasteland and this game pulls it off perfectly. The visuals are also somewhat varied with white sea beds, tan dunes, orange earthy deserts, black tarry oil pumps, and black/gray dumps. Color isn't muted either and when you see a brighter color from a flare or an enemy covered in paint it's a very pretty sight.\n\nThe sound is very top notch. The bass of the shotgun or the roar of your engine (especially when you get a V8) is very deep and a pleasure to listen to. The higher sounds like the scraping of your vehicle against another or the screech of your tires also comes off as real and fantastic.\n\nYour gameplay is going to be split into driving and on foot brawling. The driving is a lot of fun and is quite the spectacle. Taking out a convoy is a blast as you grapple off tires, shoot explosive harpoons, or use your shotgun while driving to blow up an enemy's gas tank. Driving feels fast and fluid and is a lot of fun on its own, the combat is great and is the perfect icing on top. When you're on your feet brawling around a camp it's very gritty dirty and fun fighting that's a blast. You'll be body slamming, drop kicking, and gut punching enemies into submission, and you can even dirty it up with a shotgun to the stomach, taking an enemy melee weapon and quickly disposing of a group, or a shiv to the throat when an enemy lets their guard drop. Brawling mostly consists of parries, hits, and dodges with an indicator above enemy heads to signal what they are about to do, if you're familiar with the Arkham series or Shadow of Mordor you'll feel comfortable quickly.\n\nMad Max is a game that deserves a lot more recognition for the amount of fun fullfilling content it provides. It had a very unfortunate release date but if you ever get a chance it's definitely a fun game that dips its toes into a lot of genres whilst also making them fun and unique to fit its tone. If putting on some music and driving and fighting around a wasteland on a quest for a better car and better gear sounds like fun to you it's a definite must buy.","October 24, 2015","true","38.8"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/recommended/234140/","MrWoodenSheep","MrWoodenSheep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/","2273 products in account","Mad Max is a really fun open world experience.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhxGYWOyqBc\nI'll start off by talking about the world itself. It's beautifully designed. Sure the environment is just an open and empty desert for the most part, but they really crafted some interesting scenery. Cool canyon formations, rubbel from the old world like destroyed ships, or wrecked buildings. The game's graphics look beautiful, and can actually be cranked up quite a bit considering the game is fantastically optimized.\n\nThere are tons of different objectives to complete while out in the wasteland, all decently unique to keep the game from getting stale. Sometimes you can compete in a race, or scavenge some ruins for scrap metal, or infiltrate a base. Something quite interesting about the bases, is you occasionally have the option to get some intel from a nearby wastelander surveying the location. It's not necessary, but they might give you some useful tips such as a hidden entrance, or the Base leader's weakness.\n\nYou use scrap metal for upgrading Max and your vehicle, and you gain it by doing basically everything. You can find it scattered in buildings, or pick it from the wreckage of a destroyed vehicle, or dropped from a defeated enemy.\n\nSomething I love about the game is there's quite a bit of choice when it comes to a few things. Apart from allowing you to choose how to infiltrate a base. For example, gas cans can be used to refill cars, or lit on fire and thrown to blow up doors.\n\nThe world is very dynamic. There's a full day and night cycle, and occasionally tornadoes will form. They're not very dangerous, but still freaky. Sometimes gigantic dust storms will sweep the land. You have the choice of either getting to shelter to stay safe, or drive right into the storm and attempt to survive flying debris, lightning hitting the ground in order to grab some valuable scrap metal boxes flying through. I love that the game allows you to risk it for the biscuit like that.\n\nNow to get to the focus of the game, vehicles. You can upgrade yours a very large amount. You can choose between car body shapes, colours, decals, engine types, spikes to stop boarders, rams and so on. It's very satisfying to see your car turn into a badass killing machine. Apart from ramming into your enemies, you can also use your arsenal of weapons. Either shooting the tires, or exposed fuel barrels with your shotgun. You may harpoon doors off a car, and then pull the driver out, or shoot a stream of flames.\n\nThe combat when you're on foot is very similar to the Batman Arkham games. although it has a few stuff to keep it unique in its own ways. The better you time your counters, the more bone-breaking opportunities you have. In melee combat you can still use your shotgun or finite knives to quickly dispatch an enemy. As you fight you fill up your fury meter, which basically just makes you stronger and gives you more chances to instantly finish off an enemy with stronger attacks. It's some very satisfying fighting.\n\nOverall, I've had so much fun with the game, and even after the main story I've continued to 100% the game. My only real complaint would be the fact that in order to unlock some car upgrades, you need to lower the threat of certain regions. In doing so, less enemies are driving around that area, but that means you don't get to have fun killing those enemies with your newly upgraded car. A new game+ mode would be perfect for this. Apart from that though, incredibly fun experience, very well polished and generally awesomely fun carnage!","November 24, 2015","true","84.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

A pre-release review labelled the game as "exhilarating, fast, violent, and fun" and I'd have to agree to that. The game puts heavy emphasis on vehicular combat, in which around 60% of the game requires the player to drive their car to fight against enemies.\n\nAfter a global collapse of civilisation and society, followed by an intense nuclear skirmish, Max's journey to the Plains of Silence takes an unexpected turn when a group of War Boys (run by warlord Scabrous Scrotus, psychotic son of Immortan Joe) run him off the road and steal his clothes, his supplies, his weapons, and his car before leaving him to rot in the desert sun. Traversing the wasteland in search of his prized Interceptor, Max meets a hunchback mechanic named Chumbucket, an overzealous individual that's hell bent on crafting the perfect vehicle, the Magnum Opus. After giving Max hope of exacting vengeance on Scrotus, the two form an unlikely partnership and set out in the base of the Opus in search of food, water, allies, upgrades, and redemption in a world devoid of sanity.\n\nThe two downfalls to the game are the controls and the fighting capabilities. Controls make the game feel cheap, constant big HUD reminders for which key to press, and normally you have to hold the button down rather then just press it. It doesn't seem a huge issue, but gets incredibly frustrating the more you invest time into the game. Fighting capabilities are somewhat slim, with just a couple different buttons to use to fight and defend Max. I was really hoping for something along the lines of the Batman series in terms of combat mechanics, but was mildly disappointed. However, the violent nature of Max and his different styles of taking out opponents somewhat makes up for this.\n\nOn a huge plus, this game makes you feel like the wasteland is alive. Constant threats driving around and notorious weather changes can drastically alter your initial plans. Its also extremely refreshing to find a game that doesn't include regenerating health, which makes scavenging for food and water supplies a nice change. The camera mode is superb and instantly reminds me of the one found in Shadow of Mordor, easily allowing you to capture your best images the way you want - with different vignettes/filters to apply and tweak your shots with. You will probably find yourself continuously busy in Mad Max, and with that said you will more then likely be rewarded around every corner of doing so, normally in the form of scrap (the games currency used to upgrade Max, vehicles and strongholds).\n\nFinally, the car combat is absolutely fantastic and really shines over the negative points mentioned. Numerous occasions I found myself wandering off of missions in hunt of enemies & loot. You will find yourself ramming, shooting and harpooning every vehicle/structure you find, not forgetting to mention lone snipers trying to pick you off at range. The ability to customise your vehicle (& character) to your liking is a personal favourite of mine and therefore lets you explore the wasteland as the Mad Max that you want to be. It all makes for a forward moving and overall fun experience.\n\n","September 25, 2015","true","32.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/recommended/234140/","JiveSoulBro","Jive Soul Bro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/","85 products in account","Amongst a multitude of open world games with maps littered by icons for collectibles as a substitute for gaming content, Mad Max does something with the genre: it turns all of these collectibles into exploration pieces. This doesn't exactly solve the problem; exploring over a hundred of tiny settlements becomes as tedious as hunting down a hundred of other collectibles, but it does turn what would be a collectathon into a series of adventures and the resulting product is that much richer for it.\n\nMad Max is at its best whenever it turns into a dungeon crawler in post-apocalyptic Australia. Imagine Middle-Earth: Shadows of Mordor where instead of gaining intel on orc warlords you gain intel to take down enemy bases. Scout enemy camps from afar before taking out their perimeter defenses in your V6 engine car, then battle it out inside while seeking treasure troves of metal scraps.\n\nThe features are what sets Mad Max apart from other games. There are definite improvements to the traditional Batman-style melee while car combat has a range of over-the-top special attacks such as the harpoon slam, drive-by shootings, THUNDERPOONS and flaming jets of incineration. Meanwhile, the weakness in the main story actually made me wistful for the Assassin's Creed franchise! Say what you will about their game balance; you knew absurd action hero ♥♥♥♥ was gonna go down the minute you accepted that Story Mission! Here it's the opposite: Story Missions are quite tame and most of the value comes from investigating non-essential camps and hunting down enemy convoys.\n\nOne must enjoy the greater changes Mad Max brings to the genre if they are to appreciate their purchase. This could've just as easily been a negative review if I nitpicked every little thing that went wrong: Top Dog bosses follow identical patterns, the vehicles you collect from the enemy serve no purpose, ditto the archangel "alternative car builds", some cars are deliberately rendered hard to maneuver as artificial difficulty, the greatest threat to your lifebar is an impromptu event against which you are completely helpless (OH NO, A MIGHTY DUSTER!), same ol' chore list of tasks to do ("kill 20 enemies with wall finishers." No, stop adding those), not to mention the glaring elephant in the room: you are STILL searching for collectibles! They're just properly hidden as part of your (side-) adventure rather than showcased on a map, so you end up longing for those traditional map icons whenever you're stuck searching for that one final object and be done with a particular encampment!\n\nMost games have you seek out upgrades in side quests, Mad Max makes upgrading your V6 engine into a V8 the main plot of the game. It's true! You get your car stolen in the opening, you vow vengeance, you find a substitute which you'll upgrade with better wheels, armor and such but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if Max Rockastansky is gonna drive anything with less than 8 cylinders of pure power! This is literally "Upgrades: the Game". Assault the various strongholds of Scabrous Scrotous to unlock upgrades, collect piles of scrap to pay for upgrades, perform feats of daring-do (or kill 20 enemies with wall finishers) for character upgrades. This is... "pure extract of open world game". Mind you; the upgrades are indeed wonderful, but there should be more to games than just upgrades. I don't want to play the world's most skillful scrap collector.\n\nThere's just so much good in this game for it to warrant a Thumbs Down, despite my numerous gripes. However, I obviously cannot recommend this to anyone burnt out on open world games at the risk of seeing them puke map icons. Important: check your system requirements before purchasing as this game actually caused my computer to overheat when played at its highest graphical settings. If you're still on the fence, consider watching a few Let's Plays. I promise it won't spoil the story.\n\nREVIEW SLIGHTLY EDITED FOR LENGTH","January 23","true","68.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","8"

It HAD potential, but I think a lot of it was missed. For me, the Game had more Negative aspects to it. I'd only recommend this during a Sale, and only recommended for someone who wants a Game to mess around in.\n\nThe Story itself is extremely short with just 15 Missions which take no time at all to complete. Not only is the Story short, but it just bored me and not once did I really even care for it. It just felt like an empty shell. The only thing that made this Game have some length was the fact you have to complete tasks to unlock Story Missions. Complete so and so amount of Wasteland Missions, complete so and so amount of Stronghold Projects.\n\nNone of the Characters were interesting, and although the Voice acting was decent, the cut scenes were just short, and quick to the point with no context.\n\nSurely the Gameplay would make up for it though. Unfortunately the Gameplay is hindered with the horrible Auto Camera [slow Manual Camera], and slow response on the Controls which felt like it had a slight lag after pushing in a direction.\n\nThe Game has the usual Assassins Creed style combat, punch punch, counter when you see the Marker, but unfortunately, the Game doesn't allow you to turn the Counter Markers off, which just makes the combat so easy and boring after awhile. Infact, NOTHING in the Game was a challenge... Apart from fighting the Camera and Controls.\n\nThe Game has 9 Boss Fights in total, 3 with Scrotus [the Main boss] and 6 "Mini" Boss Fights. However 4 of these Bosses is someone wielding a large Mace, ALL with the same animations, and same method to defeat [wait for him to charge, roll, start punching]. The remaining 2 are duel wielding daggers, again, same animations, same method to defeat [roll, counter when you can]. It is just absolutely lazy development.\n\nCome across a door you need an explosion for? No worries, just look 5 meters away and there will be a well placed Fuel can for you... Speaking of Fuel cans, WHY does the Game even have Fuel for the Car? The first and ONLY time I Fueled my car was at the start in the Tutorial, after that you will never really need to. I only completed my Project for auto Refueling in Jeets Stronghold [the first one which I never went to afterwards], and none of the others.\n\nBeing an Open World Game though, there would be tons of things to do right? Here is what you can do;\n\n- Death Runs [Racing]\n- Scavenger Locations [You will encounter a max of around 3 enemies, and 2 pieces of Loot].\n- Minefield [Use your Dog to locate a few Mines].\n- Camps [Destroy either Transfer Pumps, or Oil Tanks to complete].\n- Scarecrows [Destroy them to lower Threat in the Region. Takes a max of 10 seconds to do].\n- Stronghold Projects [Complete Projects for Strongholds to give free Ammo ect. You will come across these in Camps and Scavenger Locations].\n\nThis is around 90% of the Game. For an Open World, it just isn't much variety. The only thing that was half decent to do were the Camps, but this was countered with the simplistic Combat, and horrible Camera.\n\nA couple things I enjoyed were Harpooning people from my Car. As fun as this was, after your Harpoon hits, your Camera will follow your Target, even after you correct it. This will usually end with you Driving into a Wall beacuse you can't see where your going.\n\nThe last 2 Missions were just great. It's the only time through the entire Game, that I felt something for the Story. The dialog, and the Gameplay were fantastic, and it really is a shame that the rest of Game was not at that level.\n\nGenre\n- Action\n\nGame Elements\n- Open World\n- Day Night cycle\n- Weather elements\n- Combat\n- Car Modification\n- Racing\n- Stronghold Upgrades\n\nAverage Playthrough\n- 15 Hours\n\nLiked\n- Great Engine Sounds\n- The last 2 Missions\n- Great Visuals for Screenshots\n\nDisliked\n- Offered no challenge\n- Uninteresting Characters\n- Short and bland Story\n- Lack of variety of Side Objectives\n- Each Stronghold were exactly the same\n- Re-used Boss Battles\n- Slow Controls\n- Horrible Auto Camera [Slow manual Camera]\n- No option to turn Counter Markers off","January 22","true","25.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","4"

The same guys that did Just Cause 2.\n\nWhile Mad Max shares the title name and protagonist of the Mad Max movies, the world and story is actually completely non canon to the film franchise. Max here is based on neither Mel Gibson or Tom Hardy's Max Max. Completely original, and leaving the player to their own interpretations on how to play as Mr. Rockatasnky.\n\nMax starts out the game having his trusty V8 stolen, and sets off on a grandiose apocalyptic adventure through the wasteland in an attempt to get back what is rightfully his. Early in the game you meet your sidekick and comic relief for the game in the form of a hunchback named Chumbucket. Chumbucket is also your trusted mechanic, who helps Max by creating a car for him called the Magnum Opus. A vehicle which Max can customize through Chumbucket a number of ways. It is also the vehicle Max will use for a large portion of the game.\n\nMad Max takes place in a massive and barren wasteland, that shares no settings with the movies, but has completely original areas. And though the game has a lot of what you'd expect in a wasteland setting, it still seems to have a diversity lacking in most open world games. The world is as depressingly dreadful as it is also artistically wonderful. Luckily, Avalanche included a built in screenshot tool with editing features to capture some magnificent shots of the world.\n\nThe gameplay is a mixed bag. On one hand you have a combat system that is reminiscent of games like the Arkham and Assassin's Creed games as well as Shadow of Mordor, with it's attack attack attack parry attack system, with little in terms of depth. This system has been found to be quite simple in other games, but Mad Max kicks it up a notch by requiring much better timing from the player. This might be a little frustrating for some players. And others might find it a bit boring. Luckily, the gameplay has you about 80% of the time in the vehicle, and this is where the game really shines. The vehicle combat is incredibly satisfying in this game. You will find yourself ramming into other vehicles, using a harpoon to tear vehicles apart, and even shooting a modified rocket launcher of sorts to cause even more chaos all across the wasteland. And it is all executed wonderfully. What's even cooler is that while the Magnum Opus is indeed your vehicle of choice, you can steal and even collect for later use any of the other vehicles found in the game.\n\nThe structure of progression is pretty simple, but the amount of content in it is still quite massive. You have your main story progression, which sends you off on various missions to do this, collect that, kill that person. Pretty standard stuff. But you can not progress through the story entirely until you start doing some stuff on the side, like clearing out the threat of major gans in different areas, by eliminating them, taking over special convoy routes, taking over bases, and more. And there are still plenty of even more side diversions, like tons of places to loot for supplies, races, and more. Though the world may seem barren, it still has quite an enormous amount of things to do.\n\nThere is a good deal of customization also to be found in the game ranging from your vehicle to Max himself. You can change the appearance of Max himself with unlockables you gain through a progressive ranking system, and also equip him with new moves for combat, new armor, and more. You can also do your usual upgrades to the Magnum Opus which involve different body types, armor, paint jobs, engines upgrades, tires, and more. The game also has a gas system, which means you can actually run out of gas while driving too much. Luckily gas is not hard to come by, and I have never actually had the displeasure of running out. Water is more scarce, but you never dehydrate. You only need water when you get injured in combat. you can also even feed on maggots from old corpses to regain health. Sick! There is not much realism in the gas and water system, but it's still kind of neat.\n\nanyone looking for a realistic game (I've heard the complaints), please look elsewhere.

Love the fact that it was paid for by Warner Bros. who also made Tomb Raider which gave it the perfect feeling. A lot of the mechanics are similar to Tomb Raider games. This game didn't disappoint once.\n\nPros:LOTS OF DRIVING (pro IMO, could be a con for you)\nGood graphics\nLong story\nGood plot\nGood selection of cars\nTon of upgrades for cars and Max\nSo many side missions and collectibles\nHuge map\nExtremely optimized\nMostly bug free\nGreat special effects (smoke, fire, sounds)\n\nCons:Only single player\nReally hard bosses with no difficulty setting\nA few times certain sound effects were mute\nSometimes the game isn't clear with your objective\nYou can drive any car you find but can't use it as a primary vehicle\n\nConclusion:I had a lot of fun playing game especially after reading the book and watching the movie. WBs did a very good job with this game. When I saw the movie this was exactly the game I imagined. There's nothing I thought was missing except the multiplayer aspect. Especially after the story is done there isn't much. It would be cool if they made a The Crew type online mode where you see others.

I highly recommend this game.  It has been a while since I picked up a game and played it exclusively until I finished it, and I'm glad this was once of them.

It feels like a game of missed opportunities.  There is this big, very well-crafted world set in a post-apocalypstic land with not all that much to offer an intrepid wanderer.  Yeah, you can drive around and see ruins of buildings and signs, but there is almost never a real point to doing so.  You can pick up tiny amounts of scrap (the game's currency), but after you've liberated some camps the scrap pickups become just another collectible.  Speaking of collectibles, the history relics started interesting enough - a photo, a postcard, a handwritten note of days gone by that Max wistfully comments on - but when I realized I'd collected dozens and wasn't even halfway through the list, I gave up.  They aren't THAT interesting.\n\nThe story is cliche at best, the anti-hero just looking out for himself until he meets someone who reminds him of better days and then has to systematically destroy the bad guys.  It's awkward.  At least when you fight, it has real impact.  Punching dudes never really gets old in this game, but the combat has its drawbacks as well.  There is "tap for light hit" and "hold for heavy hit", and a counter button.  You unlock various finishing moves throughout the game that can be useful in group fights, but sometimes the game doesn't respond quickly enough and allows Max to take a hit while setting up such a maneuver.  When in Fury mode, he hits real hard and does some incredibly satisfying suplexes, but there is no way to do it on purpose - you just get lucky.\n\nCar combat starts off similarly, forcing you to think a little bit about your approach before you have upgraded your car.  By the time you can hurl thunderpoons at other cars, it's just not that fun anymore because everything explodes pretty easily.  As stated many times, the mini-bosses scattered around are a joke.  They all attack the same way (unblockable charge) and in most cases, you defeat them the same way - hit them with a real big wrench or something else lying around.  Occasionally there are environmental hazards that can aid you - say, but letting a boss charge into a flame burst - but it's nowhere near the extremes of something like Sleeping Dogs.\n\nAfter a while, you realize that reducing threat across the various warlords' regions by tackling side actitivies (read: map vomit) has stopped being beneficial, as Max is decked out in crazy gear and the car is nigh invulnerable (car upgrades are often locked behind getting threat below a certain level).  It just stops being fun.  I mainlined the last several story missions to get it over with and wasn't left very satisified by the ending.\n\nIt's probably worth a play if you dig the universe and don't mind icons all over the place (complete with hot air balloons that let you identify all the actitives in an area!), but it's not really anything spectularly different.","October 28, 2015","false","42.0"," 66 of 111 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","66","111","0","0"

The combat's a bit repetitive by endgame, but your moves basically turn into a lot of shortcuts to victory and the shotgun is a huge boon in that it'll OHKO all but three classes of enemy*. Vehicle combat is cool and you can build the Magnum Opus (your ride for the game) into a variety of different styles: I went light armor, fast movement, and a lot of harpoon/tire-spikes to take out enemies, with a massive ram for a stylish finish. Someone else could just turn the car into a tank, or take careful shots at an opponent to blow them sky high, or spit flames from the car to consume anyone else nearby. It's a decent customization level, and that's one of my biggest issues with it:\n\nYou don't get a lot of toys until the very end of the game, doubly so if you're like me and do a lot of side-content before main events.\n\nWhich sucks! And while the story missions do put together some nice scenarios and events, I actually think some of the side stories are better designed or more interesting than the main game. The only really, really distinct thing the game did for me in its main story was the final gauntlet, which was actually kind of unpleasant to play through even though I can't fault it from a character standpoint. Meanwhile, the side missions and some of the camps took on a whole lot of environmental storytelling, from underground oil refineries, to the almost puzzle-like nature of some of the scrap hideaways, to scaling an old power structure to take down a warlord in his own home.\n\nThe thing that leaves me most disappointed in this game is that this is one of those games that would be perfect with one more revision, they take this finished engine, tweak it a little, and spend all the time of a sequel on design rather than coding, but it's pretty much guaranteed to never happen, and I don't see anyone mining this game for ideas when the next Big Thing comes around and vehicular open world debauchery is going to be forgotten. It was really fun.

You play as Max, a survivor in harsh and unforgiving Wasteland, controlled by bandit gangs.\n\nLaying almost dead, and bleeding on the burning sands of Wasteland. Beaten down by the bandit gang with all of your hard earned possessions stripped from you. Max must find strength to get up and take the Mad to the bandits.\n\nThis game is basically Tomb Raider + Uncharted 2 with Carmageddon vehicular madness in post apocalyptic Wasteland. Thus you get similar movement, platforming (to extent), survival, looting and equipment upgrades as in Tomb Raider / Uncharted 2, with more refined and brutal hand to hand combat. And all the crazy vehicle madness from Carmageddon, in addition to the upgradeable vehicle parts and body modifications.\n\nControls are responsive yet tad sluggish, but you get the hang of it fast so there's nothing wrong here. Voice acting is good, with great lip sync in cut-scenes, but not so much out of them. You drive your car mostly through sand so it's understandable it will feel a bit unresponsive, but you can modify so many aspects of your vehicle and fine tune it to the handling you need.\n\nEnvironment is mostly Wasteland, so rocks, sand, sandstorms, occasional dust devil, as well as some nice view distance on landscape. Once in a while you see some eye catching scenes at night or by day that make you stop the car and soak in the beauty, even though it's just barren Wasteland.\n\nMain currency in game is scrap, similar to Tomb Raider where you come across some crates with parts, here you pick up metal scrap that is hand placed through environment and also can be dropped by enemies and destroyed vehicles. You use scrap to upgrade your car, pay for Max's upgrades, modifications and gear.\n\nMain gameplay besides story is to capture, destroy different points on the map, to eliminate bandits and reduce gang presence in that area, so less bandit patrols, higher rewards from survival ally camps who take control of the camps you free.\n\nHand to hand combat is brutal and often pleasant to the eye. You fight more than one opponent at the time with counter indicators that let you plan your attacks, defenses. The higher combo you keep, the stronger attacks are, you can combo fast and strong attacks with ground and weapon takedowns, and also with body to surface detection. So you can sprint bash someone into the wall and then beat him silly holding against it.\n\nVehicular combat is all about ramming sensitive parts of enemy vehicle, ripping off car parts with harpoon to either get to the driver or just have fun and tear off tires from vehicle to continue the fight on foot. Enemies can jump on your car and get to you if you're not careful, so plan your car upgrades and invest in less defended areas.\n\nI already talked too much, even though I wanted to keep it short. It's very well made game, runs on Havok engine which is awesome. You can fine tune the settings to match your hardware, personally I didn't have any issues with it even being below recommended and playing on High. It looks like majority of players who bought this game are happy with it, and for the low price (not on steam) it's well worth the money spent.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=510204277\n\nP.S. Took me 75 hours to beat everything, with 48 out of 49 achievements. Didn't bother with last one because you have to do ALL in game challenges, and there are A LOT of those. In the end (with not trying to do them) I didn't have around 20, and I don't feel like wasting time completing those. Other than that I'm very happy with the game, I enjoyed it a lot, and it was money well spent.\n\nEnjoy.","September 1, 2015","true","74.7"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","18","24","2","0"

Game runs smoothly at 60 fps, no micro stuttering, no sudden unexplained FPS drops, it has plenty of different graphical options and is easy adjustable and reconfigurable.\n\nLet's start off with the map. It's apsolutely huge! One would think that stranded in a desert would be far from entertaing, but developers managed to pull this world off beautifully from occasional wanderers that ask for a sip of water in exchange for an information, to different camps, sniper's nests and so on. There is always something going on like convoys traveling on route, war boys attacking you and trying to steal your car and so on.\n\nGraphics wise, game is beautiful. Explosions, dust storms, all those tiny particles are visible and they really create unique immersion with not only the game but the main character - Mad Max.\n\nGameplay - I'd say this is the focal point of the game. From driving, to looting, destroying, killing warboys, this game has it all. AI in this game I feel is really on point, chasing the convoy, demolishing cars, everything feels super polished.\n\nDriving in the beginning feels somewhat stiff and weird, awkward and delayed, but as you progress and upgrade the handling, it gets only better, easier and the vehicle itself gets stronger and stronger along the way.\n\nIf you've played Batman Arkham games, the combat feels more or less the same, but with more brutality, suited to Mad Max's persona. It's very satisfying and rewarding.\n\nNot only you are able to fully customize your car as you wish with dozens of different body's, parts and such, you are also able to change Max's outfit, grow him a beard, make him stronger, faster, more resistable and so on. Game offers a lot without being too overwhelming on that part.\n\nWhen it comes to story, unfortunately I can't vouch for it and say that it's the better part of the game, but as you know, you're Mad Max, left alone to survive, find your peace and solace. Story is as good as Mad Max's story can go in my opinion.\n\nI'd say that the negative side of this game would probably be repetitiveness. Given that there are a lot of stuff do collect, smash, dismantle, loot and so on, I can see how it can feel for stale for someone who is looking for more vibrant kind of game.\n\nI'd rate this game a solid 8.5/10. Quality title and definitely worth the name Mad Max.","September 2, 2015","true","42.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","2"

I'm torn on this game, on one hand the Batman style combat is tried and true,(I have to add that after replaying Batman Arkham Asylum, the combat is a lot more responsive and fluid than batman) and the car combat is pleasant enough, on the other hand this is the majority of things to do in this game.The story what little of it there is left me wanting . There are certain choke points in the story where you are bottle necked into doing the highly repetitive "side missions" to reduce the threat level in each goofy dumb-asses territory you need to proceed through to the end of the story.\n\nThe main content consists of shooting snipers off perches,with a very poor shooting mechanic only available from the back of your car. Blowing enemy convoys up with your car, which is the one of the better realized components of the game but becomes trivial after some of the late game upgrades for your car thus removing replay-ability.  Pulling down towers with your cars harpoon, also trivial but required to progress, but I had some of my most enjoyable time in the game just driving around the games world. The vehicle handing is fun once accustomed to it.The game has very few fast travel points compared to most open world games. But it can be exciting driving your death machine around the wastes.\n\nThe most time consuming part of the game is going into enemy camps where section by section you use the before mentioned batman style combat to achieve a small set of simple and repeated goals. Although it is similar to other games combat it has its own unique touches that brought glee at times. The tools at hand in combat are gruesome and useful allowing the above mentioned fluidity to combat, making combat the most pleasant part of the game and consequentially the game play is what helped me push through to the end of the story. Although upgrading Max's abilities brings more tedium to the game, you are forced to drive to a roaming shaman-esque character in order to spend a skill point.Halfway through I found myself dreading the proceeding the bored cut scene pushed every time you visit this "shaman". So I took the route of letting five to ten points build up before i took the time to search out the shamans newly relocated position on the map. Which seems odd because my garage i.e the way to upgrade the car is simply in the game menu?....\n\nI found the game to be getting too tedious around the hour twenty mark, so hey I got twenty hours of funish game play out of it before i could take no more and just mainlined the story as fast as i was allowed. I decide to lean positive due to the fun I did have but fair warning, the game is VERY repetitive and i was disappointed when it was all said and done that the game gave me to compelling reason to play after completing the story.","May 5","true","35.1"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","3"

In a way, it's one of the first apocalyptic worlds I'd ever seen.  It has it's appeal.  Thunderdome and Tina Turner with the crazies and bloodlust.  These days it's all post-apocalyptic hell with zombies, so seeing a wasteland in a new but familiar universe of Mad Max wasn't hard to process and a nice change for all the end-of-the-world-ness in games I see.\n\nWell then, what's it all about?  Giant open world areas, some fun car caravan takedowns, the usual batman-eque fighting, using a  fast car to destroy stuff, and mostly enjoying the world of Mad Max in a video game.  A first I thought, "Ok, Batman-junior with a car. Not bad".  There is a fervor in the knuckle-fighting that is Max.  It's not a precise brawler, yet not a hack n slash either.  I couldn't really stop, though.  Insert coin, get video game fast food adrenaline rush.  My goal was to try and take them all down without firing a shot, that made the fights extra edgy.\n\nThe fun bit for *me*, though....the open world car takedowns.  And this varies from gamer to gamer because some folks dislike open world.  Personally, I just dive in and forget to actually play the missions.  After playing for a few hours I left the main campaign and drove around the open world leveling up for 20+ hrs.  Then I got back to the campaign all uber-leveled with a wonderfully growling car only to find I could not get to the next mission. I wasted about an hour or more trying to get it to work.  Finally, I gave up and looked online. I found I had to level *down* my car to get to the next mission.  What is up with that?  At least give me a hint, but to keep it completely out of the mission description?  Weird.  Why bother making an open world if you need a linear leveling playthrough?  So, *that* kinda stunk.\n\nNext up was learning to attack cars, gates, and snipers with my grapple hook.  Soon to be upgraded to a THUNDERPOON.  Yep, it's called a THUNDERPOON.  Basically having a lightweight RPG gunner in the back of your car.  Sweet.  But I preferred the grapple personally.  Maybe it's more batman-ish, but I enjoyed aiming it at tires and stopping bad guys with a hook to the chest.  Pooning was a bit too easy and I only used it for aiming at gas tanks at camps.  Some of those camps had several flame inducing gas tanks, snipers in tight areas, and defense towers made of shooting fireballs. These were a great joy to attack.  That was the best part really.  Once you got past the defenses, you crack some heads until you get to a mini-boss with minions and usually giant blazing stationary flamethowers.  I ran my bosses into those as a fast way to finish.  The problem?  ALL the mini-bosses were like that.  It got old after awhile.  Even down to the last side mission, it was all the same attack, evade, attack.  Not much to it.  Makes me scratch my head how come they didn't add some variety to the bosses.  It would have added so much more to the game if *any* of them had some special abilities.\n\nNow I loved the driving and chasing the bad guy on their supply routes.  It was sorta GTA style and even though the car was hard to maneuver I never got tired of it.  You can add more armor and stabilizers to get better handling, but I found the armor slowed me down.  Better to stay light to keep up.  Unless you skid out of control and end up in a ditch.  But, the car could take a good beating.  The death runs were okay and just required a bit of practice to remember where to slow down and speed up. Using nitro was also a good help on a straight path with it's fast speed boost, but in general made me lose total control if I made any sort of turn.  What NAILED me was the race against Stank Gum. It was there - after a bajillion attempts - that i realized i had too much armor and needed to lighten up the car to keep up. Once I did that, i was able to complete the mission with just a handful of tries.  That can be the hardest part of the game, or the easiest.  Depends how good you are at driving games and how heavy your car is when you start.\n\nRight around that part of the game, the story *finally* gets interesting.  Before, it was mostly summer-movie-story-action filler.  But towards the last 15% of the game the story makes some good progress. Which is great because after awhile I would just get bored and chat with my buddies on steam or watch twitch while I played 10 minutes every hr.\nSome nights I'd play maybe 20 minutes with the game running all night long.  I was losing my interest pretty bad.  Past the Stank Gum mission, though, you may finish the game a little faster because it's getting more varied as you go.  I will say the end mission is pretty decent and I felt like it was a good ending.  I'm not going to spoil it, but that ending was a lot better than say the ending to Shadow of Mordor.  I had to play the Bright Lord DLC to get a good ending to Mordor - which is a shame because I *loved* Mordor other than that ending.  Mad Max ends well and becomes a decent game towards the last 15%  of the campaign.\n\nStory isn't much, but it's voice acted well and frankly I liked the storyline more than the movie.  That isn't saying much because the movie was mostly an action packed sequence with little dialogue going on ( in my opinion ).  But the game has a lot more going on.  What it *is* missing is the connection to the people surviving out there in the vast dry death of a world Max lives in.  You get some connections here and there, but mostly you bounce from camp to camp and just do missions without really talking to anyone.  Where is the love?  Max is a loner, I get it.  But, wow, there wasn't anything even close to a personal experience until the end.\n\nArt direction is a gritty gorgeous wasteland.  A perfect Mad Max open world with quite a lot of detailed landscape and nicely working physics.  I got into it.  Maybe I'm a loner too, who knows, but it appealed to me.  At least until I finished and decided I need to move on to my backlog again.  Lemme drive all over and smash into bad guy cars.  I loved that.\n\nOne more thing towards the end - and here I will be critical - it gets more and more glitchy.   A few scenes had my car inside of another car, I drove all the way to the end of a mission only to get stuck on geometry for 15 minutes while i wiggled everything possible, and the occasional cutscene where the person's head disappeared.  But my biggest gripe was the last side quest.  Someone decided to make it only work *at night*.\nI could not fast forward time!  I tried upgrading the camps with scrap metal which seems to fast forward time a bit, but it would miss the nighttime somehow.  So, i drove around for over 2 hrs until I got to a night scene in order to finish the game sidequests. That was *so* annoying.  Somebody got cut a check for that idea.  Arrgh.  Please WB, it's *not* fun or challenging.  *Don't* do that again.\n\nOverall, a solid entry.  Nothing spectacular, but it has it's good points if you enjoy driving recklessly beating up brighly painted shirtless dudes in an open world.  Amazing? Nope.  Bad ♥♥♥?  Nope.  Worth the time? Um, yeah, as long as you like the above statement on driving and don't expect much variety in the bosses.  Plus, you get to be Mad Max!  7/10.","February 14","true","88.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","2"

Max’ ultimate quest is to reach the Plains of Silence, a fabled land where he might find solace from his madness. But instead, he finds himself getting his V8 Interceptor stolen by the War Boys of Scabrous Scrotus, Immortan Joe’s third psychotic son. With the help of Chumbucket, a blackfinger, Max embarks on a journey to get his vengeance and take back what is his.\n\nThe main plot and some scenes may be predictable to some, or maybe even a cliché to at least. But it doesn’t mean it’s bad. In fact, I personally enjoy the story all throughout and I’m pretty satisfied with how the story went.\n\nGameplay  – The game showcases two types of gameplay. First off is when a vehicle, the gameplay is somehow similar to Vigilante or the Twisted Metal series. Though you have the option to use other faction vehicles, nothing is compared to what the Magnum Opus, your own vehicle, can offer you. Other than the harpoon, sniper rifle, and the thunderpoon, you also have the freedom to customize your vehicle the way you want it to. And it is actually balance and just. Not because you have all the high-tier upgrades, it doesn’t mean it’ll be the best vehicle out there. No. And that is actually great in my opinion. And the upgrades can actually be seen in the vehicle, you can style the Magnum Opus any way you want it.\n\nSecond is when you’re on foot. If you have played any Batman Arkham games, you’ll most likely be familiar with how this game works out. And this is one of the most brutal games I may have played not just because of the blood, but because of what can Max do to his enemies. I’ve been hearing multiple cracked jaws and bones everytime I beat someone and it is very satisfying. I have mentioned that there are upgrades for your vehicle; well there are also multiple upgrades for Max to help him out in his fights.\n\nEnvironment and Design  –  The whole map is huge, at least for me. To be honest, I am more than surprised to see how amazing the world is. Sure, in a rough glance the world may seem too flat or bland. But wait until you start exploring side quests and maybe just roaming around. There are lot of stuff to see in this game.\n\nControls  – I’ve played this game with a controller, I feel like it would be easier beating up enemies and driving the vehicles with a controller instead. For problems, I’m glad that I didn’t run into any major ones to ruin the game for me. Though there is a thing that may become annoying to some as you progress through the game. Most of the time, the game will require you to hold the interact button or key for you to take action. It gets annoying because you will be doing it a lot of times.\n\nConclusion  – I may have finished the story of this game, but there are still numerous areas undiscovered, many camps aren’t looted yet, many towers not yet taken down, some snipers are still hunting. If you’re interested in games that still offer something even when the main story is done, then this one deserves to be in your wishlist. Even with the fps that I’m getting, I really had fun playing this game.\n\nA fair warning to those with OCD, when you’re in a camp, the game will show you the total scraps there is in a specific camp or area. And guess what, I used YouTube twice on two different areas just so that I can achieve a 100% on that specific camp and move on to the next one.","January 16","true","33.3"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","7"

I don't write reviews becuase I am rarely pleased, let alone excited like I am with Mad Max.\n\nI have gotta hand it to the developers.  They did a great job making this game.  I have been playing for 32 hours so far and there hasn't been a single crash.  There has been the occansional slight stutter and drop below 60fps (according to FRAPS).  I am running WIN7-64 with a 3.4Ghz i7 with 32GB ram, RAID 10 SSD array, and dual AMD 290x's in crossfire(stock-clocked).

I have been playing PC games as long as PCs have been around (Yes, I have some grey hair -- maybe more than *some*).  This is the first game in a long time (since DOOM 1.0 and early WOW) where I have been sucked in and immersed in the game.\n\nThe overall experience, strategy and the pace of the game keep me coming back for more.  I find myself looking forward to playing and letting other responsiblitles slip in order to keep playing...\n\nI wish all of the last 10+ games I have purchased were even 1/3 as enjoyable as Mad Max.

Collect metal scrap (the new currency) to update your car, a hideout or climb the skill tree that is available for Max. Fight your way through hordes of enemies, either with your shotgun or barehanded. The combat system is a little like the one from the Batman Arkham series. So a little simple, but works quite good for me. And it feels somehow a lot more realistic than in Batman. Infiltrate hangouts, race wild sand races against some quite tough opponents, do little side-missions, collect relicts of the past...and so on.\n\nGraphics     9 of 10\nI LOVE it! From the sandy dunes with the beautiful sunsets to the starry bluish nights. Absolutely amazing. My friend is playing it on a 4K tv screen and it's just amazing .The footprints in the sand, the incredible storms, the water. BIG thumbs up.

Very fitting for this post-apocalyptic world.\nThe part where it really shines is the sound of the car engines.

Sometimes the fighting is a little repetitive and the taking of the hideout as well and the story is not that breathtaking. Still I strongly recommend it.

The ridiculous pre-order deals (I got it for 36 dollars at GMG), and the publisher connection to the recent Arkham Knight debacle had me worried I'd wasted my money.  I've never been so wrong.  This game is:\n\n1.  Fully functional from the start.  No stuttering, no texture pop-in, no frame-rate cap or issues, no glitches or bugs.  The optimization is the best I've ever seen for a AAA launch title - I was able to play at reasonable FPS at 4k with one GTX 970.\n\n2.  Achingly beautiful.  I said I was able to play at 4k, but I didn't have to because the game is so perfectly crafted that it looks suitable photorealistic and jawdropping even at 1080p.   Special emphasis on the lighting, shadows and particle effects (the explosions are phenomenal).\n\n3.  Raging fun.  The melee combat is smoother, harder, and way more engaging than in Batman: Arkham.  It requires attention and quick reflexes and feels intense and deeply powerful.  The sandbox world is massive and filled with violent activities.  The general goal of these can get repetitve towards the end of the game, but the devs did a marvelous job of making each and every location look and feel different to keep the excitiement to the MAX.  One issue here is that the boss fights at some of the camps are more or less identical.  There are four main strongholds that can be upgraded and expanded through what are essentially fetch quests, but still just as fun and varied as the story missions.\n\nBy far the best part of the game is the vehicle combat, analogous to the recent cinematic masterpiece Mad Max: Fury Road.  Along with random open-world encounters, there are convoys around the game world and you take them on singlehandedly using not only your car as a weapon but shotguns, harpoons, thunderpoons (grenade harpoons), and flamethrowers.  These convoy battles  get progressively more intense as the game progresses, and are a highlight of the playthrough.\n\n4. All about the cars. They could've totally screwed it up and made a Mad Max game where the cars were a sideshow.  They did not.  Basically the entire plot centers on Max's desire to be reunited with his Interceptor, and in the meantime to build the most outrageous war machine possible with the help of his master mechanic hunchback companion Chumbucket.  Throughout the game you upgrade your car (The Magnum Opus) with body styles, engines, suspension, tires, exhausts, armor, weapons, custom paint and ornaments.  You can also collect any car you find in the wasteland for further use.\n\n5,  A sonic experience.  The car sounds are gloriously rabid, and each engine and exhaust mod makes your Magnum Opus all the more ferocious.  Play it in 7.1 surround and the vehicle combat comes alive, with earblasting explosions and roaring v6 and v8 thunder.  Voice acting for the main characters is sublimely realistic and emotional; wish there were more Australians in it though.\n\n6.  A surprisingly engaging story.  For me, the ongoing love story between Max and his Interceptor was enough, but the later portions of the story were unexpectedly strong and well-written.  No spoilers, but Max gets realllllllly mad.\n\n7. A true addition to the Mad Max canon. This is a faithful and yet inventive new venue for Max.  His character is portrayed just right, with minimal dialogue and just enough haunted memories to make us believe we're really Max Rockatansky.  Visually, he's a hybrid of Mel Gibson and Tom Hardy, and his upgradeable clothes and weapons are legit and very cool to use and look at.\n\nTo conclude, I finished the main story at about 25 hours of play, I've put another 10 in so far to complete the car upgrades and clear out enemies from the world.  The average player will probably get 20-30 hours out of this, but being a massive fan of Mad Max I'm not even close to leaving yet.  I recommend it to both newcomers and fans of the series -  its an action sandbox tour-de-force.

But Mad Max is nothing like that. Mad Max is an absolute gorgeous game, let alone it's optimazation is great aswell, the combat is extremly fun and the driving's fun and action packed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberghost/recommended/234140/","cyberghost","Cyberghost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberghost/","1190 products in account","Releasing a movie tie-in game usually goes one of two ways: either it’s a rush job thrown out with the movie to get some quick bucks, or the developer actually has the time it needs, regardless off the potential loss of income because of a later release date. Thankfully, Warner has allowed Avalanche the time to make a solid, vast open-world that is a lot more fun than the colour palette might suggest.\n\nAnd there is an enormous amount going on in Mad Max; just so many systems operating at once. You can upgrade Max, or his beloved car, The Magnum Opus, whenever you like from the pause menu with scavenged scrap (the currency that runs the world), but there are core abilities that you can only level up using tokens received from completing challenges. These are the important ones, really, as they increase things like Max’s strength, or health, or even how long a full tank of fuel might last. But you can only upgrade these at set locations. They’re not hidden and are on your map, but it’s a little odd to have a conceit like this in play when there are so many moments that flaunt how gamey it is.\n\nTake Max himself, for example. Once the car takes a certain amount of damage you’ll have to get out and wait while your companion, Chumbucket, fixes it up. But the enemies don’t care, and will keep coming at you. The AI here is quite smart (elsewhere they will expertly dodge you as you drive around engaging them), and will just try to drive right over you, but if you have a decent amount of health, you’ll stagger a bit but not die. After a few dodge rolls and a bit of running round in circles (get used to doing this, by the way), you can jump back into your ride and get moving, harpooning a Wastelander out of his car to certain death.\n\nThese moments are as stupid as they are cathartic. The way you can take damage is obscene, but all is forgiven when you enter slow-motion, harpoon a guy right in the chest and tap circle to quickly pull him from his vehicle, whereby he whips towards you, which lets you ram him head-on. The harpoon gun is a triumph, and the most Avalanche thing here. Driving around firing it into sniper towers and pulling them down never gets old, and the sniper rifle mechanic is interesting, too. Rather than giving you a sniper to run around with like the shotgun you have, it’s fired from the back of your car. Chumbucket can drive the car for you (though you control it) and you can creep up to enemy bases, slowly picking off their snipers. Again, it never gets old.\n\nThankfully the wasteland survival ideas are well implemented. Water is scarce, sure, but most of the time you’re in a situation where you’ll need to use it to heal, it’ll be some kind of stronghold (small or large) so there will be a tap, or pool to fill up your flask. Gas is needed to keep your vehicles running, but it takes a while to use it, and again, tanks can be found at populated areas. In a nice touch, you can put a spare canister in your boot just in case you run your tank dry, but you can also pick it up and throw it at enemies, exploding it with a shotgun burst.\n\nThe combat is the Batman Arkham melee method that, quite honestly, I’m nowhere near tired of. Mad Max’s world is a brutal one, and although you can happily pummel away at combos with the square button, and counter with triangle, things are mixed up with the addition of unlockable extra moves. A particular good one (early on) is simply to hold the attack button after two hits for a strong finisher. You can pick up weapons and integrate them into your move-set, too, and if you’ve collected any shivs you can finish people with them. Or, should you buy the skill, you could just get in close for a shotgun to the gut – it’s a one-hit kill, obviously. It makes for a violent, bloody system that feels damn good.\n\nCar combat is less successful at first, but not bad. Depending on how upgraded your vehicle is, you can use the harpoon to differing degrees of success, but you can also target the red barrels in the trunks to quickly blow them up. On top of that, another option is to simply ram into your enemy – which has varying degrees of success depending again on what you’ve spent your scrap on. There’s a lot of car combat, though, and the slow motion aiming is a Godsend that removes most of the frustration. But you’ll have to get used to it, as you’re a sitting duck if you leave the Magnum Opus for too long.\n\nIt’s a very a-typical open-world game, in many ways, but one that’s faithful to the source material, especially when it comes to the characters. Max is an utter ♥♥♥♥, but a badass with it. No matter what people do to help, he’s never nice to them. You could argue that this is because of the harsh, barren world he inhabits – everyone here wants to kill you, or use you for a deal. But the character you warm to the quickest is Chumbucket, so it’s hard to hear Max continually abuse him with his negativity. The voice acting is fine, for the most part, but the downtrodden, gruff Max is a little hard to like. It’s a very comic-book like universe, and the people are designed to match: burnt skin, tattoos, and even one guy who has razors cut into his skin – I’m not sure if that’s for effect or so he can keep his face beard-free.\n\nWhat Mad Max does best, however, is never, ever take itself seriously. The opening cut-scene (which I won’t spoil, obviously) is over the top, but also features a gruesome chainsaw scene. As you take control for the first time and realise the person in that scene isn’t dead, you realise exactly what kind of game this is. There’s no logical reason how he can be alive after what you saw, but there it is, and he’s the main antagonist you’re fighting back against.\n\nThe story is generally fine, but nothing special. Most main missions see you have to chase something down and take someone out, and although there’s an attempt to make you care now and then, it falls flat. The fun is to be had just exploring, maybe getting caught in a horrendous storm that nearly takes your life.\n\nTechnically, there are a few frame-rate hiccups that are seemingly par for the course with open world games, but otherwise the only way Mad Max suffers is because of the source material. Fire, sand, metal – the trifecta of the world. You can’t blame Avalanche for keeping to that, but it does sometimes make for a bland looking game. There are some excellent moments, though, like those storms, or when night is setting in and it gets cold. Particle effects and explosions are fantastic, and there’s a real sense of style despite the brown look, especially when it comes to the gorgeous sky.\n\nMad Max is a fun game. You’ll happily lose an hour or two here and there, and feel great about it Nobody quite does that open-world charm like Avalanche, and the harpoon never stops being a source of mirth. The combat is great, and if you’re after an open world third-person title, you could do a lot worse.\n\nPros:\nHarpoon gun is brilliant.\nVisually stunning at times.\nOn-foot combat is great.\nCons:\nStory is a bit dull.\nCar combat won't be for everyone.\nMy Rating: 7.5/10","January 30","true","11.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","1"

They story was short, not that thrilling and the hand-to-hand combat was a childs play without creativity just demanding alot of button mashing. I would really have liked to see more variation and tactics required in hand-to-hand combat. Throughout the wasteland I was dying for more interesting quests and events, but they are simply not there. The explosions and action though, are top notch. And the game runs solid as hell on PC. It's an easy buy for 20£, but not worth 50£. Maybie I'm just open-world spoiled after playing Witcher 3, but this game has little to discover between A and B once you scratch through the surface.\n\nEDIT: Worst part in my whole Mad Max time, was when I spent 3000 hard-earned for hours scrap on upgrading a Stronghold's stockpile to maximum level, just to find out its just a pure cosmetic upgrade and it didn't give me ♥♥♥♥ in return. Instead of buying nice car parts or upgrading Max I literally spent a hefty amount on not getting ♥♥♥♥, I mean seriously what the ♥♥♥♥ was that, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game developer design meets evil of its pure form? Maximum V8 upgrade became far to reach again and I was done with all missions, so it simply uninstalled the ♥♥♥♥ing game because I can't stand such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.","September 14, 2015","false","21.8"," 48 of 82 people (59%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","59","48","82","6","0"

Time vanishes. What you thought was maybe forty-five minutes, was four hours. I think part of the reasoning behind this is because it's repetitive in every way. I am surprised it doesn't get more criticism for this. Everywhere just about looks the same. The camps which you clear are all similar. Scavenging destinations are all similar.\n\nThe really only parts that are not all similar are the main missions. However there are not many of those.\n\nMad Max has other issues too. The engine-exhaust noise of the car is diabolical. I wear headphones and it screams albeit mid pitched (not high pitched) almost all the way through. I play on speakers too and it's as bad. Only later when you get the V8 engine is car noise acceptable.\n\nIt is unfortunately nothing more than a long grind, and is possibly the grinder of all grinders. Salvage scrap, unlock upgrades, use scrap as currency to upgrade. From start to finish that is all you do.\n\nIt has plus points. It often looks good. Bosses are all the same technique: wait for charge, dodge, attack for a bit; repeat. In other words there is no googling every boss encounter because you can't work out what to do. Gameplay is straight-forward. In fact all the gameplay is relatively easy. It's filled out by there simply being masses of it.\n\nAlthough I mark it 7/10 I could not in all honesty say to a friend, "You must buy Mad Max". Meaning no recommendation.

What about RAGE? And possibly Batman? If you like all of those three games then why are you even reading this...go get it NOW!!! This is a game with a likeness to all three IMO. It has the same look and feel to Tomb Raider with very similar game play experience. You have plenty of neat little underground worlds to explore and if you dont want to go underground then mix it up like the Wombles did and go overground too. Why not try driving up to some deserted places like a crashed plane or sunken boat or deserted train stations and trains in the hills or far out in the desert. The combat is very satisfying with excellent effects and even better noises and bone crunching sounds. Visuals are fantastic on a high end rig. It has the same satisfying RAGE effect when driving a car. As in, you can blow stuff up...a lot. There are some great little upgrades you can add to the Magnum Opus car. These include flames coming out the side, spikes on the body to prevent enemies jumping on and boarding, a powerful shotgun, harpoon and rocket launcher (in essence) and some normal body and engine upgrades. You can have so much fun with the harpoon pulling building structures down, ripping wheels off cars or ripping a man out of his car and dragging hi, around like a rag doll! Combat and sound is very similar to Batman and the way it feels. Overall this was such a surprise for me this year and is easily in my top 3 games only behind GTA V at the moment.

No egos.”\n\nMad Max is an imaginative action-packed open-world experience. It feeds on the mythology left behind by George Miller, and it successfully brings the Wasteland to gaming, both visually and spatially. Racing and race-battling has never been so dynamic and thrilling, and melee combat is as polished as a combo-oriented gameplay could deliver. The core of the quest design revolves around upgrading a "mystical" car named Magnum Opus, and delving into revenge against Scabrous Scrotus, the archenemy who initially assaults Max and his Interceptor, leaving the drifter for dead in the hot white desert. Thematically, pride and an apparent sense of dignity are still present in the narrative. Max refuses to eat “long pig” (basically, cooked human flesh), and instead feeds on maggots from human carcasses. Thirsty wanderers can be given precious water from the protagonist’s canteen, and a feeling of gratitude is promptly served. Stronghold upgrade projects raise the morale of the inhabitants, and their impression of Max. The Wasteland is represented as a place suited for brutality and survival, but also hope – albeit often romantically portrayed.\n\nAs regards story and plotline, there is not much to be said. Well, if you are interested in everything Mad Max, you probably know that a complex and foregrounded chain of narratives is not the franchise’s emphasis (especially if considering the latest film). The game follows that premise. What it does offer is a myriad of apocalyptic motifs, from the re-domestication of nature, to the emptiness of Earth’s post-nuclear shell, to the nostalgic grief over a long-dead world. Such motifs could inspire much more immersion were it not for Max’s always-melodramatic lines when collectable pictures from before the fall pop up. Additionally, the figure of Scabrous Scrotus is forgettable at best, and just a sootier and bossier version of Rictus Erectus.  The final battle against him and his petrol-powered retinue is underwhelming, a poor attempt at reproducing the famous Mad Max ending road skirmishes that ends too quickly thanks to the almost indestructible state of late Magnum Opus and the surprisingly reduced amount of hostile vehicles. Apart from that, a few tragic plot twists, unique writing and dialogues, and creative cutscenes might somehow redeem some of these negative aspects in writing.\n\nCharacters are often tragicomic representations of eschatological personalities: they are usually on the edge of their beliefs. A fume-induced sadist, a pyromaniacal prophet, a bloodthirsty tyrant, a delusional road rider. Hope and Glory show little promise from start, and never actually manage to entice any significance or emotional attachment from the player, even towards the end. Chumbucket’s permanent company may intimidate the player at first, but with some time, they will find that his persona is an inseparable part of the game, an inseparable part of Max’s quest. There were moments when I was driving along in an enemy car and caught myself missing his very personal remarks about the landscape, the Magnum Opus, the dangers around, about everything worth remarking about in the Wasteland. The rest of the characters are interesting and colourful individuals that show precisely how they have survived the wretched world for so long under those sorry conditions, exhibiting perfect doses of leadership, insanity, and sarcasm.\n\nThere were some other wee things that I could not avoid feeling annoyed by: no matter how you approach the open world configuration of the game, you will never complete a task only once. Be ready to scavenge repeatedly, fight repeatedly, rescue and explode repeatedly. Repetition is not necessarily a compulsory aspect in the exploration of the map, and it may not be a problem for completionists, but it is there to fatten playthrough time. Also, ignore what the first shots of the game tell you about the scarcity of Max’s basic resources: there will be plenty of them, more than enough to get you by until the end. You will most probably never run out of water or fuel if you look decently enough. Scrap can be an annoyance, but only if spent away carelessly or if the urge to scavenge seldom arises during your gaming sessions. The structure of quest design is much standardised, oftentimes a list of identical objectives to be ticked off one by one across the available map, until the quest is finally over. Although this works in perfect unison with the background story of these quests, it does not help much to have that layout, considering the game’s already repetitive nature of open-world tasks.\n\nAll these aforementioned things – good or bad – are not even close to expressing precisely how much fun I had playing Mad Max. Only when you hop in the Magnum Opus, build it up little by little, and scavenge the entirety of the massive game world, will you feel that the hours you spent were worth it. However, I have to warn those who are not fond of open-world "collectathons" to think twice and watch some vids before getting hold of this game.","November 23, 2015","true","67.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Turns out I was wrong, thankfully.\n\nLet's start off with the story; I've always thought that the Mad Max franchise would work best as a videogame, it just has that "weirdness" and exaggeration that you only find in popular game franchises. This game certainly proves--to me at least--that I was right in this belief.\nYou play as Max (obviously), a guy who has some mental issues (though not really hinted of much). In the first hour or so, your car gets stolen and you are left for dead. Thankfully, you come across a "Black Finger" (mechanic) called Chumbucket. He's a little weird, to the point of sounding like a religious nut towards Max and the car, he even makes one liners towards... urhh... 'romantically' loving the car!\nAnyway with Chum's help, you set out to seek revenge and take your car back. The whole storyline is pretty much "We need a V8 engine to proceed". While it's simplistic, it works fine. Let's just say that the ending is quite obvious though.\n\nThe fighting system is pretty much what you'd expect in this day and age from an "open world" action game. It's very much a Batman Arkham system, though not quite as refined (more realistic, for example you're not jumping around the screen to keep your combo going). I had some rare instances that it wouldn't even register my key presses (using a gamepad).\nThere's not much else to say about it, it's pretty much as you'd expect from such fighting systems now days.\n\nIt's the car that is the hook here.\nUsing the various upgrades available, you can customise both the functionality and cosmetics of your vehicle. Like to go at high speed straight into people? Focus on acceleration, top speed and your ram. Like to get close? Make sure to get spikes to help prevent boarders.\nWhile there isn't a massive amount of upgrades, it's still enough to keep most people interested. Vehiclar 'fights' are quite fun, much more so than the repetitive Batman Arkham fighing anyway.\n\nThe area you're in is a very, and I mean VERY, large section of desert.\nIt would take you anything up to 10-15 minutes to drive from the furthest points, depending on your vehicle's upgrades. Doesn't hurt that the game is somewhat nice looking too.\nIt has the 'Sync Points' that the Assassin's Creed franchise introduced, but with a twist. Enter a balloon and slowly assend. Now instead of just seeing a cutscene and that's it, you have to find everything with your binoculars. It's an interesting mini-game at first, but soon loses it's welcome.\n\nTo unlock upgrades for your car, you need to affect each territory's THREAT level. This is done in much the same way Just Cause 2 did; take over camps and destroy stuff. In this case, you're killing snipers, finding and defusing landmines and bringing down 'scarecrow towers'.\nThere's 3 territories, plus a no-man's land. Each territory has it's own set of the above things. A couple upgrades require to complete side missions too.\nIn each territory, you have a 'stronghold'. Do side missions and collect required 'parts' to unlock projects. I'd suggest to always build the Cleanup Crew projects as soon as you possibly can. It's a godsend! Projects include health, ammo and water (which is like your 'medipack') refills.\n\nYou upgrade Max in very much the same way as the car.\nInstead of territory THREAT levels, however, it's your 'rank' that unlocks items. Right off the bat, you should purchase the crowbar; it's required for a lot of looting. You can even get Max to grow a beard, if you're into that.\n\nScrap is everything in Mad Max, so make sure to loot destroyed vehicles (Cleanup Crew project is useful for this) and camps whenever you can.\nYou'll need scrap to level up Max, the car and fully upgrade your Strongholds.\n\nLastly, do not rush through the main story.\nYou likely will not enjoy your time playing if you do; instead try and work towards uprading Max and the car as much as possible before moving onto the next territory. Various story missions require you to grind anyway, so you may as well do so between missions!\n\nMad Max is a game I'd recommend to both fans and non-fans of the franchise alike.\nYou don't really need to know anything about the franchise due to this game being a standalone from both the original and recent reboot of the movies.\nHOWEVER, I'd suggest you wait until a sale of 30% off or more before purchasing due to it's repetitive nature.","September 12, 2015","true","40.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","3"

That being said, I have a hard time understanding why reviews have ranged from the 5 to 8.4 range. 96% positive reviews on Steam means gamers have spoken for themselves. With a cool combination of Fallout, Borderlands, Far Cry, and Just Cause, Mad Max has stunning visuals, engaging combat in-car and on foot, and a great variety of characters.\n\nWhile I haven't found the story particularly enthralling, it is still fun. The open-world environment, however, is where this game truly excels. As I head towards an objective, I frequently find myself distracted doing other things, such as disarming a minefield with my trusty dog Dinki-Di, clearing out a camp, or being ambushed by a group of enemy vehicles. It is these types of fun distractions that make Mad Max shine.\n\nEverything in this game is upgradeable. Fortresses can be upgraded to give Max refillls on Fuel, Ammo, Water, and Health. The Magnum Opus has millions of possible combinations, from colors and insignia to the body, to engines and other parts. These upgrades make a noticeable difference to the feeling of driving the car, as well as to the way it actually sounds. Max himself can be upgraded in two ways: by visiting Griffa to enhance health or a variety of other attributes, or by adding armor, etc. that gives Max a boost in combat.\n\nI have not found the bleak, postapocalyptic landscape to be repetetive or dull. The graphics are extremely high quality, espcially with Nvidia SLI and AMD Crossfire support right out of the box. The sky and weather visuals are fantastic, especially when a tornado or huge sandstorm occur. Additionally, these storms never seem to be the same, with some looking like the lightning/tornado from Fury Road while others look like a sever haboob in New Mexico.\n\nThere are some things I have not enjoyed about the game, and which I feel should have been included right out of the box. Despite his reputation as a road warrior, Max is not able to jump over simple obstacles. While he can jump, he will often need to find the predetermined route into a stronghold, generally marked by yellow paint. Something else that has bothered me is the low quality of graphics in Jeet's stronghold. Avalanche seems to be going for a rising heat effect, but the result is blurry textures. Despite these flaws, the game is still very satisfying.\n\nDriving is an absolute pleasure. As you upgrade your Magnum Opus, you won't want to fully upgrade everything. Putting a heavy ramming bar or armor on your car, for example, will lower your acceleration and handling, making the car less nimble. Upgrading your engine, tires, or suspension will have the opposite effect.\n\nHand-to-hand combat is both gritty and brutal, with Max using objects in the environment to beat his opponents to a pulp. Fans of the Arkham series will be familiar with the controls, but the combat still has a unique feel to it. Anyone can button mash their way through this game, but there are huge rewards for using the special combo moves available to max. Players who take the time to learn and practice these will find their satisfaction with the combat increases greatly. Additionally, Max can build up a fury meter to unleash Fury Mode, which greatly enhances his attacks and allows for special Fury finishes.\n\nMad Max doesn't break any new ground in the saturated open-world genre, but it is a rich, immersive game with fantastic graphics and satisfying combat. Reviews have been quite varied, but if you are looking for a new game to play, listen to the gamers themselves and pick up a copy of Mad Max for PC.\n\nVerdict: 8.9/10\nA few flaws diminish the experience somewhat, but this is still a AAA title worth investing many hours into.","September 1, 2015","true","44.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Not as fluid as either, and somehow less brutal than Sleeping Dogs's. It gets old. There are nice ways to avoid it, since  the shotgun is pretty much a "end this fight" button,  and while the ammo for it is plentiful, it is scarce enough that you are encouraged to save it for  big fights. It is always great to reenact the swordfightning scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but just like in that movie, you can run out of projectiles at the worst possible moment.\n\nThe driving is a VERY big part of the game, as it should be, since this is Mad Max we are talking about.\nThe environments are pretty distinct  from each other, which makes travelling a pleasure. The bad part comes that for the  optional races, you generally get to use a completely different car that handles unlike your custom rig, and it gets a bit hard due to not being used to the handling of  the race cars.\nVehicle variety also suffers, since it feels like the factions each have the same cars, but with cosmetic differences.\n\nThe convoys start as an interesting activity, trying to replicate the feel of the chase sequences on the films, but unfortunately they fall flat after a while, since the experience is repeated over and over, though it gets easier when you get more tools at your disposal.\nFunnily enough, the closest I had  to a chase sequence from the movies was in an optional "wasteland mission", where you have to drive a big, slow  truck with resources to a relatively far away point.\nThat felt a bit like the final chase from the Road Warrior, but not quite the same, obviously.\nApparently, if you reduce that area's danger level, there would be very few enemy encounters in that mission, which is an interesting detail, there were scripted pursuers  AND ones drawn dynamically from the regular area spawns.\n\nEnemy variety is kind of lacking.  The factions each have similar archetypes. And the "top dog" fights are unfortunately, not unique. All the top dogs  behave the same, which gets fairly old. They are optional, but it would be  neat if there were differences in them besides what comes in their arenas.\n\nThe strongholds and bases are quite fun to explore, often having far more going underground than what you can immediately see above ground, they  feel like puzzle platformers at times.\n\nThe game is by far the prettiest of the open world games I have played. Which makes the  use of the picture mode (shared with Shadow of Mordor) a  VERY welcome addition. Both are ridiculous eye candy and worth  absorbing.\n\nThe  main story itself feels fairly aimless at first, but the set of endgame missions are ramping in intensity greatly, they are honed to a point. It ends with both a bang and a whimper, but be warned,  this is Mad Max. This is not Road Warrior. This is not Beyond Thunderdome (even though it has a tacked-on thunderdome), and even though it looks a bit like Fury Road, this is not Fury Road at all.\nThe tone  and pacing is more like the original than anything else. And it manages to hit almost as hard as that one did.\nMaybe even more so, because of the interactive nature of  games.\n\nThere are many things that could have been better done, but for what it is, it is an amazing ride. If you have  a chance to play it,  do so. It might surprise you.","December 1, 2015","true","40.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Let me introduce you seven fundamental reasons why the game forces you to play it!\n\n1. Optimalization. What a perfect optimalization!\n... forget on Batman´s epic fail. On the highest settings the game runs like a Swiss watch. Many thanks to Avalanche studios for really good job.\n\n2. Wasteland. What a atmospheric wasteland!\n... really big, really large and variable.\n\n3. Details. What a impressive details!\n... fortresses, various locations, points of interests and more.\n\n4. Sandstorms. What a real sandstorms!\n... I can´t remember better processed video games sandstorms. Maybe in Spec Ops: The Line, but in Mad Max sandstorm appears randomly in two variants.\n\n5. Ride. What a rough ride!\n... feeling of riding is really enjoyable. Not only in Magnum Opus.\n\n6. Combat system. What a brutal combat system!\n... simple but effective. You know his older and better brother from Arkham series.\n\n7. Visualization. What a sexy visualization!\n... nice graphics, effects of explosions, mentioned locations.\n\nAfter 15 hours of gameplay, Mad Max caught a second wind, gets momentum and simply will not let you go. Despite the fact you´re doing the same thing all the time.\n\nI´d like to support devs by purchase upcoming Just Casuse 3. They deserved it in times of terrible console ports.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=517947684","September 30, 2015","true","51.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Add to the the graphical delight and DaVinci styled perfection to watch we have what is 500% better than the new movie was and takes us back to the wonder that was the original Mad Max movies within a modern timeframe.

The game's strengths comes in short play sessions of an hour as the car combat is great with the use of the Harpoon, and the strong characterization of Chumbucket as he comments about what's going around you will keep you interested. It's got a great variety of level design, and the PC performance is exactly what you'd want for a PC game in 2015: It runs smooth and can get the best out of the top-end systems. But on the flip side, ground combat doesn't play to its own strengths as the camera becomes a major problem in the counter based fighting, and frankly, the game has a lot of repetitive elements to it and can really feel like the gameplay has been extended to the point of breaking. You get your moneys worth, but in the end, Mad Max is the perfect game to get on a discount: there's nothing that forces your hand to get the game right now.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/wEkJnV8_XMo\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nThe car combat is reasonable, with the harpoon being fun to use on almost everything. In fact, just the Harpoon alone at times makes for some chaotic fun.\nChumbucket, the mechanic, shines as the most interesting character by far, with his religious devotion to automobiles and his excitement about all things combustion.\nBase Level Design keeps things fresh over the long haul. Reuse of elements are done in a way that it never is noticed.\nThe world is beautiful in particular with the sand locations.\nCharacter design takes advantage of the license in terms of visuals and voice acting.\nPower comes in the name of upgrades, and opens up combat and options to a considerable degree.\nThe amount of hours you can get out of the game is high and has a bang for buck.\n-:\nMissed story elements that really could have taken the game to another level, overall the narrative is poor and doesn't do well with the license.\nGround combat doesn't have enough variety to it, and doesn't understand the strengths of the system in place. The camera is a major problem.\nFocus on “realism” can hurt the game at times, with it hurting gameplay pacing in terms of naturally taking advantage of the open world.\nRepetitive nature of tasks really becomes more of a chore. While there's a lot to do, there's a lot of the same thing to do.\nEnding actually fell a little bit flat for me, despite others liking it.

The game itself plays mostly without any hitches,  I had a few minor issues and one random crash through-out the entire playthrough, whilst I wouldn't say this game is perfect by any means and does get repetitive after a while, but it is something worth playing if you enjoy post apocalyptic open world driving/fighting games.\n\nPersonally, I would have liked to have more varition of the activities and more bases to conquer, but for the the price I paid it was a really good deal for the amount of time I've spent playing and enjoying the game.    Now, there are some points to be made here, the game does have glitches and bugs, especially with defense which sometimes significantly bugs requiring you to reset equipment to get the stat 'working' again,  and the cars handling sometimes is strange - very easy to spin-out or lose control of the car and crash into one immoveable object in a large open world...the game loves to do that for some reason.\n\nBecause of the cars handling, I'd really recommend playing this on a gamepad, especially the driving portions of the game which make up a large part of the game.   Overall, I still recommend this game even though it has a few short-comings.","April 21","true","46.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

From what I can tell, I didn't have to. I didn't plan on focusing on the story anyway because I was purely looking for gameplay. Holy ♥♥♥♥, did it deliver. If you thought Rockstar put a lot of detail into GTA V....Avalanche put more thought and care into this game than Rockstar could ever dream of. (for example, when you're looting an area it will tell you when everything has been looted and if you're missing anything. As someone who plays games to find EVERYTHING, this made me very happy). First off, it's an amazing port (as long as you have updated drivers) aside from the menu controls on keyboard/mouse. They seem to have their querks, but it's nothing too bad. It performs great and I only encountered one crash and that's because my drivers weren't updated. The audio struggles a bit on Windows 10, but it's nothing major at all. The combat is very Arkham-ish but that's okay with me because it works and it feels good. I personally didn't even expect hand-to-hand combat, but there you go. The driving will take some getting used to; at least until you get your car upgraded and then the car handles beautifully. The vehicle combat can be a bit tricky early on, but here's a tip - level your harpoon as often as you can. You'll use that more than anything else (at least I do). There's plenty of map to explore, too. At the time of writing this review, I'm almost 9 hours into the game and I have only done roughly 4-5 story missions. To conclude, this game is beautiful and you should get it at all costs. My only problem is that Warner Bros. were involved with this game...but thank you, Avalanche, for another great title that IS NOT broken. I'm looking at you, Arkham Knight...","September 5, 2015","true","33.5"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

The gameplay looked a lot like the styles seen in games like Assassin's Creed (AC) and Batman Arkham, series that I absolutely adore. I was and continue to be thoroughly satisfied with my gameplay experience.\n\nIf you enjoy open-world action and adventure, RPG elements, intense car combat, post-apocalyptic themes, gritty visuals, and the Mad Max franchise (especially Fury Road), then you will love this game.\n\nFor full disclosure: my top game of 2014 was Middle: Earth-Shadow of Mordor (SoM), and while I will readily agree that there are much better quality and more in-depth alternatives available, I found SoM to be the most fun; it truly captured the essence of why I enjoy playing games and losing myself to immersion. Mad Max is very similar to SoM for me, in terms of fun factor and enjoyment. I completely understand that people may not like games like this - finding them too repetitive - however, I will do my best to provide an accurate and fair representation of the gameplay you can expect to encounter if you buy and play this title; but please keep in mind that I may still be biased in my review. I would also like to quickly point out that this game is NOT a simple copy-and-paste (or "reskin") of games that I have previously mentioned - such games are definitely formulaic, yes, but they are not direct copy-and-paste titles.\n\nThe aesthetics are fantastic - the amount of detail in the environment, character/car models, and special effects is extremely high. Optimization is amazing (so long as your drivers are up-to-date), ensuring that you are receiving the best possible performance while you play (admittedly, I was a bit worried about this PC port following the poor launch of Arkham Knight). The special effects are beautiful - car explosions are massive and bright with pretty fire (moving close to fires will cause the world color to take on a more orange hue), the lighting and shadow effects are realistic (the glare off of your car lights at night time is a sight to behold), and storms are majestic (I implore you to brave a journey into the heart of one once you have a stronger Magnum Opus). The music and sounds are great, however, do not expect to hear any of the tracks from Fury Road (sorry, no "Escape" or "Brothers in Arms" playing while you fight off enemies); the game's soundtrack is still very good. Following the lore established by Mad Max: Fury Road, the story is interesting and engaging - although nothing too special (much like Shadow of Mordor); I will admit that a few times I have skipped cutscenes and/or ignored dialogue.\n\nControls are not difficult to familiarize yourself with, especially if you use a gamepad and have played game series like Assassin's Creed or Batman Arkham. Unfortunately, you cannot rebind the controller keys, and you can only remap a limited amount of actions on the keyboard - this is definitely something that could have been improved for player convenience. As a result, you cannot easily call up the keyboard controls - in fact, I had to check the discussion boards to find out how to bring up the full map (on the keyboard, it is "Tab;" I thought it was "M"). There is a series of tutorial missions that will quickly get you accustomed to the gameplay. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with open-world adventure games in this vein. You will encounter difficulty with mid-to-late-game main missions if you are not exploring and completing side objectives - this is the "grinding" aspect of the game that helps you build experience and obtain upgrades. This element is seen in other games like the Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkham series (as well as Shadow of Mordor), so if you do not enjoy that style of gameplay, you will probably be dissatisfied with Mad Max. The "boss" fights are fairly easy, especially if you are keeping up with your character/car upgrades.\n\nGameplay consists of you roaming the wasteland, with your final destination requiring you to first stop by Gastown. The road to Gastown is a brutal, dangerous one, so you will have to first gain more experience and upgrades in neighbouring territories, which are each ruled by leaders that you will meet and help. Each territory is split into smaller pieces and littered with different landmarks like enemy outposts/camps, scavenging areas (for delicious loot), and race meets. Balloons in each territory can be taken into the air to mark important areas, as well as reveal the surrounding land in your map (this is similar to climbing the tall vantage points in SoM and AC). If you do activities that directly affect the enemy - like liberating camps or disarming minefields (the latter being extremely boring) - it will reduce the "threat" level of the entire territory. Reducing threat ratings will result in decreased enemy patrol frequency and presence, making your travel time through the area quicker and less painful.\n\nMain missions progress the story, usually unlocking more of the map and allowing you to obtain better upgrades for your Magnum Opus (your beloved car). In contrast, upgrades for Max are tied to your "Legend" rank, which is increased by doing mostly anything - like destroying enemy vehicles with your shotgun, achieving high combo chains, or killing x amount of enemies; there is no actual "experience points" system. Whenever you complete these "challenges," you will obtain a token that can be exchanged for an ability point, thus allowing you to level up. Each Legend rank (the top being "Road Warrior") is composed of multiple sub-levels, and obtaining a new one will grant you more upgrades for Max like appearance, ammo capacity, and physical damage (all accompanied by nice aesthetics).\n\nCombat is extremely fluid and responsive, albeit quite easy (as is the case in most of Warner Brothers' open-world action-adventure games) because of the counter prompt that appears over the heads of enemies about to attack. Something that balances the ease of countering/parrying is how the button input works - you cannot simply mash the attack button because each attack is a commitment, so if you are already doing an attack animation, countering will probably not work (encouraging you to be patient with your commands). Furthermore, countering right before an attack lands will execute a "perfect parry," which will help build your combos faster and even allow you to disarm an opponent's weapon (further enhanced by Max's ability upgrades).\n\nABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\nMy Website[theroguereviews.com]","September 1, 2015","true","22.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

The reviews online that complain about all the fun things you can do in game seems to punish you and make you NOT want to play the game are from people who havent unlocked any of the upgrades for the most part. Yes flying off high cliffs or even small jumps will heavily damage your car when you first start. Yes slamming into cars full speed or walls will make the Magnum Opus explode fairly quickly as well. When enemy cars hit you from the sides or the rear yes you get damaged very easily.\n\nSo what do you do? Play the game and start to unlock upgrades. There is alot to do in game from looting camps for scrap, car bodies, unique cars, and car upgrades. Alot of collectables that give history of the down fall of man and destruction of the world. The people you interact with are as they shouldbe all on the ragged edge no hope completly untrusting....at first. When you get to your first stronhold its little more that a hole in the ground with nothing to help you other than a place to store all your cars you start to collect. The first thing id recommed doing when you can start to upgrade your strongholds is seek out each of the parts required to make the, gas tank, water collector, ammo table (in some cases this will happen as you complete story or a wasteland mission), maggot farm, scrap pallet, and scrap gathering team.\n\nThe various things you can do include races for Crow, attacking camps (doing this will put wastelanders in them that give you free scrap at diffrent intervals in game), wastleland encounters that range from intel on camps, to free scrap, Legenday encounters giving you much longer missions to do. On this not alot of the encounters are avaliable at the start many others will unlock as you do story and wasteland missions.\n\nCombat in your Magnum Opus is pretty stale at the start. Harpoon doors, rip them off, then harpoon the drivers, you can shoot the fuel tanks for instant kill, blow out the tires and ramming the cars is also another way to take them out. After you get the thunderpoon upgrade to blow up cars, upgrade the harpoon to rip the wheels off, get the flamers for burning the cars on the sides of you, and of course upgrade the bumper to do more ramming damage its alot more fun. When you get access to the sniper rifle you can only use it from the car but you can thin enemy ranks and blow up camp defenses pretty easily with it. I reccomend killing warcriers ASAP they make melee combat a real pain if the get everyone amped up increasing there damage and attack speed.\n\nAs far as defense in the car goes adding body armor and boarding spikes is the way to go. No other upgrades in relation do defense.\n\nOk on to melee combat. At first it will feel alot like just block, attack, block, attack, over and over......and it is. After you start to upgrade max you can truly get to having fun with diffrent combos, finishers, takedowns, usings shivs and melee weapons. Shivs break after 1 use, you start being able to only carry shiv, your starter shotgun only has one shot before you need to reload so only use them both when you really need to. After a few upgrades you can carry more shivs have a shotgun with up to 4 barrels and can carry many more shivs and alot more ammo.\n\nSuviving in the wastes and finding water is not TOO hard to get after you get your first strong hold up and running with all the upgrades along with fuel and ammo. You can get a full reload of everything about every 15 mins. After you unlock multiple strong holds you can jump back and forth to stay replenished very easily.\n\nThe story is good and really starts to explain why max is so messed up mentally, hearing voices, and makes you really feel for Max. I wont go into what happens to ruin the story for you but it is well done.\n\nI would like to see some extra areas added to the game like Bullet Farm or the Citadel so mabey WB's will release some DLC's with them in it if we are lucky and this game does well. Thats my only real complaint about this game.\n\nThats about it I hope you got somthing useful out of this review and enjoy playing Mad Max.","September 5, 2015","true","53.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

The driving controls, at least on keyboard seem a tad bit off, I tended to just spin out on the most innocuous terrain. Also enemies tend to cheap shot you during execution moves which just feels cheap. There's a lot of collectibles to find and while I think they could have upped their value exploration is still worthwhile because they don't repeat layouts for camps and scavenger locations, Elder Scrolls this is not. The atmosphere is really good as well. Writing is pretty cliche and not good though, but Chumbucket, your hunchback mechanic is nicely written. It also lays the grimdark on a little bit thick, which is rather glaring considering that the movies aren't. Mad Max is one of those games that never truly achieves greatness though, it could have really been enhanced by stuff like Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis System. (I have no idea why they didn’t seeing is that WB published both.) Regardless if you’re looking for a good sandbox game, Mad Max will definitely deliver and while it’s not PERFECT IN EVERY WAY, it’s not MEDIOCRE as the reviewers are saying.","September 14, 2015","true","52.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

All that remains are memories.\n\nI remember a time of chaos... ruined dreams... this wasted land. But most of all, I remember The Road Warrior. The man we called "Max." To understand who he was, you have to go back to another time... when the world was powered by the black fuel... and the desert sprouted great cities of pipe and steel. Gone now... swept away.\n\nFor reasons long forgotten, two mighty warrior tribes went to war, and touched off a blaze which engulfed them all. Without fuel they were nothing. They'd built a house of straw. The thundering machines sputtered and stopped. Their leaders talked and talked and talked. But nothing could stem the avalanche. Their world crumbled. The cities exploded.\n\nA whirlwind of looting, a firestorm of fear. Men began to feed on men. On the roads it was a white line nightmare. Only those mobile enough to scavenge, brutal enough to pillage would survive. The gangs took over the highways, ready to wage war for a tank of juice. And in this maelstrom of decay, ordinary men were battered and smashed... men like Max... the warrior Max. In the roar of an engine, he lost everything... and became a shell of a man... a burnt-out, desolate man, a man haunted by the demons of his past, a man who wandered out into the wasteland.

The sound of motors fading in and out in the distance, a zealous hunchback rambling on in the back seat of my all important four-wheeled conveyance. I wait for the sun to go down over the course of minutes, pondering the vast wasteland before me. It’s a quiet and peaceful moment, which is striking in a game filled with screaming war boys and magnificent explosions. Sometimes the best parts of an open world game come between missions, when the mechanics and controls fade away and you are just in a new place beautifully rendered before you. Mad Max has its flaws, but its wastes are highly suited for wandering the roads in search of excitement, and the game does a great job of gradually making the player understand the titular road warrior.\n\nWant to know more?

The game blends popular elements from other games into a post-apocalyptic open world with a focus on driving.  Fans of Assassins Creed, Shadow of Mordor and the Batman Arkham games will feel instantly at home.\n\nYou have the Batman combat, but surprisingly more brutal and less "smooth", which I think works pretty well as you aren't a superhero!  You have an enormous map, which is probably the biggest I've seen in a game like this.  Finally, you have an abundance of collectibles and that satisfactory feeling when you completely clear an area  and have it marked as 100%.  The game certainly is repetitive, but fans of collectibles and upgrading will enjoy this game and that part of the game appealed to me more than the lacklustre story on offer.\n\nWhat makes Max Max stand out from the open world crowd is the use of the "Magnum Opus", a car that you will do battle in, upgrade and race over the entire course of the game.  There's plenty of choice when it comes to upgrading weapons, making the car faster, getting the armour upgraded and adjusting the parts for the task at hand.  I enjoyed this part of the game immensely and I don't even enjoy driving games.\n\nA slightly boring story and repetitive gameplay will turn a lot of people off, but the game does shine when it comes to its driving mechanics and how it gives you so much to collect and explore in its enormous map.  Graphics aren't the most important thing, but I have to say that the game is gorgeous and managed to make a game that is mostly sand look breathtaking at times.  I highly recommend this game to people who like the games I have mentioned and perhaps those who were intrigued by the driving sections in Rage.","May 10","true","72.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

This is one of the best-looking games ever made, and it performs flawlessly even on middling hardware.\n\nThe sound design matches the visual quality and enhances the wasteland's hostile atmosphere.\n\nMelee combat is heavily inspired by the likes of the Arkham series and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, which to me is a good thing, but some may find overly simplistic.\n\nBut obviously what sets this game apart from other open-world action titles is vehicular combat, and it's as fun and enjoyable as you'd expect from a game set in the Max Max universe. Your car - or should I say, the "Magnum Opus" - itself is a weapon (with which you can ram and grind enemy vehicles), but as you progress in the story you'll equip it with a grappling gun, a sniper rifle and a makeshift rocket launcher, making it the ultimate dispenser of death and destruction.\n\nThere is, however, a distinct lack of motorcycles and larger, truck-sized "war rigs", such as the ones seen in Road Warrior and the recent Fury Road.\n\nOpen-world games have been criticized lately for excessive reliance on inconsequential side-missions and collectibles, something that has been referred to as the "Ubisoft school of open-world games". Mad Max has side-missions, collectibles, strongholds, camps: the whole nine yards. But none of them feel like fodder. Every little place you visit has its own unique design and backstory, giving a sense of immersion that is sadly quite rare these days.\n\nThroughout your adventures you'll be assisted by Chumbucket, the horribly disfigured hunchback mechanic. I won't call him a sidekick because he's every bit as important as Max himself, and is really the heart of the game.\n\nAnd he's just one of many interesting characters you'll meet. Friends and foes are all equally well designed and voice-acted. It helps that the dialogue is great, too.\n\nAnyway, there's so much else I could say, so let me be perfectly clear and be done with it: this is not just a recommendation.

Humbley and happily Mad Max will avoid being classified as another movie licensed failure but instead of one of the more successful and sound examples of not onyl a good movie licensed game but a good game in general.\n\nMad Max seemed humble and a little slow at first, until i came across the major plot sequence and central focus of the game. Customising and building your very own wasteland beast. Not only do you get to customise a pre-existing frame of a vehicle, but have the option of many different vehicles, and on top of that many vehicle body, engine and wheel modifications, that combined in different arrangements make deadly combinations to tear other vehicles apart. This is without a doubt Mad Max's strongest feature, alongside its gritty and earthy combat system in both hand to hand and vehicular. The hand to hand combat feels viseral and real, hitting someone in the face with a wrench makes a satisfying sound, and a believable reaction. The vehicular combat, can be tough but damn is it satisfying, running a car off a road into a rocky out crop and see it break into pieces and blow into a flaming heap of spoilt chrome.\n\nMad Max is a solid game, with a great level of optimization across the board, and great gameplay. Its only setback in my Lore loving eyes of the mad max world is its realtively weak Storyline and weak central protagonist, in both voice acting and overall appearance. All in all, this game is truly exceptional and i give it a high recommendation.\n\n","September 2, 2015","true","43.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skorch82/recommended/234140/","skorch82","Bl0rch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skorch82/","365 products in account","I will admittedly say that because this game was inspired by a movie, I was half expecting it to be a flop... I was pleasantly proven wrong.\n\nThis game provides a nice open-world experience with plenty to do and a fun combat system that makes running around doing things that seem tedious actually quite fun.\n\nThe story is relatively minimal, and the way the game lays out your "objectives" leaves a lot of interpretation up to the player as to how you go about completing your missions. Many missions will have criteria that must be met for you to start (such as previous objectives, certain upgrades, etc.) that will force you to go out and complete tasks in order to earn those upgrades and progress further into the story.\n\nThe game is based very heavily on driving, specifically, your very own car that you upgrade with you like a man and his dog. The car will become your primary source of combat, means of travel, as well as the ability to reach new areas. One aspect that I thought was pretty intuitive was the introduction of the fuel gauge-- that's right, your car has to run on actual fuel. At first, it seems like the fuel supply is low, restricting your ability to go anywhere and do anything, but there are numerous ways to increase the efficiency as well as find spare fuel all over the place (you can also get special projects in each stronghold that will give you an instant full tank), so I never actually had an issue keeping the tank full.\n\nThe gameplay and the controls are pretty well implemented, following gameplay style like the Arkham series and Shadow of Mordor (both WB productions), and with the detail of Just Cause 3 (same dev). The only complaint that I'd have about the gameplay, is the jumping... your character can jump, but not more than a foot of the ground. You rarely have to use it, that it just seems like it's there to keep some semblance of realism. It's more of a gripe in that it somewhat restricts your ability to go "anywhere".\n\nThe music is also very well set to the game, it provides an ambience that puts you right in to a savage wasteland with some creepy inhabitants, and never feels like it gets in the way.\n\nThe menu system is pretty comprehensive but I will give a summary of my pros/cons that will address a few quirks I noticed.\n\ntl;dr\n\nPros:\n+ Fluid gameplay mechanics\n+ Interesting combat system (both on foot and in car)\n+ There's lots of content that can be accessed before completing major missions\n+ Upgrading your car and customizing the builds are satisfying to your type of play (speed, attack, weaponry, etc.)\n+ Fuel is plentiful (you just have to be observant)\n+ Map and fast-travel system is very useful\n+ Engaging story and fun missions\n+ You can cheat in death runs (races)\n\nCons:\n- The main side content is just different takes on the same few concepts (which can get repetitive quickly)\n- Finding large quantities of scrap is annoying\n- The game can "hold your hand" in places (look for yellow everywhere to indicate where you can go)\n- The menu interface can be annoying when you find a new part and you have to switch back and forth to effectively compare two parts (hood ornaments mostly)\n- The jumping mechanic is just filler\n\nOverall, I had a good time with this game. Give it a chance if you like open world, combat focused entertainment.","March 6","true","38.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I liked all of these games, but the combat and cars reminds me the most of the excellent Sleeping Dogs. Gameplay is solid. On the ground you can hold your own but you're no superhero. Even the weakest enemies can overpower you if they are too numerous or your reactions are too slow. The best part is the cars. Three of the initial 5 car bodies are reminiscent of the classic Interceptor, so you can play the campaign in a heavily customized ride that "feels" right. Max's legendary set of wheels are automatically unlocked after completion of the campaign. Depending on your level of devotion to this world you can take your time with the story or just putter around exploring the barren landscape to hunt for treasure and fight bandits. If you are a completionist Mad Max could be a grind, particularly the vehicle combat. To accomplish all challenges, it is recommmended to avoid clearing areas totally to keep enemies spawning. Movie adaptation games are usually in the "miss" category of hit or miss, so I'm very happy how Mad Max turned out. Being fond of the original film & the excellent Fury Road made this experience all the more enjoyable.\nedit: 100% after 80 hours roughly.","February 26","true","80.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

How do I explain? Quick thoughts below:\n\nJust a line on the graphics and the performance of the game, both are excellent, it is a lovely ,looking game and it runs flawlessly (bodes well for Just Cause 3), now onto the game itself.\n\nMad Max about 3 things, Driving, Fighting and Upgrading your car, everything else in the game is merely a vehicle (no pun intended) to allow you to do one of those 3 things. Tasks in Mad Max are repetitive with copy and paste quests and objectives as you explore the map, which some people, including myself would describe as busy work, or padding, or even grinding if I were to be harsh.\n\nThing is though, they are all tasks which let you do three things;  Almost always you’ll first be driving around meaning you’ll be blowing up, ramming and dismantling other cars with your harpoon gun whilst hurtling through an apocalyptic Australian outback complete with dried up seabed’s and places to explore and scavenge.\n\nYou'll then get to where you're going and you'll be Fighting, usually against multiple opponents in an Arkham style fighting system with brutal animations and sound effects, Max isn't a well-trained ninja but a brawler, handy in a fight and able to look after himself and that really comes across.\n\nAfter that you'll have earned some scrap to upgrade your car, as well as Max, buying new engines, tyres, armour, weapons, special moves etc etc.\n\nAnd... rinse then repeat. It is this pattern over and over with some slight variance here and there for story missions. Whether you like this game or not comes down to how much you enjoy those 3 things, and for me, I really did. That's why I played it for 41 hours and finished a lot of the game before doing the story.\n\nOf course it isn’t totally as simple as that, there are other things for you to do and even the above 3 activities are wrapped up in narrative driven reasoning or have a tagged on objective, but trust me when I say you’ll always be driving, fighting and upgrading. That is the meat and potatoes of Mad Max.\n\nThose 3 mechanics might not work for some and therefore they would bounce right off it and think it is an average or even a poor game. Not in my eyes, one of the most enjoyable games in 2015 for me and I hope you think the same should you give it a go.\n","November 8, 2015","true","40.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

On the contrary - if you do like open world game, or if you like Mad Max universe - you might easily find yourself enjoying this game (just as I did).\n\nIt's true - there's nothing new in it. But all existing things are executed so well, you can almost see the competence of Avalanche Studios oozing from every polygon.\nThe combat is very similar to batman/shadow of mordor combat, but has a little less variety (again, probably because of that "play safe" approach).\nThe towers from Ubisoft games were replaced with balloons that you don't have to climb, just fly up (they are pretty awesome vistas though).\nCamps are camps - you either have to kill anyone inside or blow stuff up to "capture" them. Sadly, that's all you can do with them, no additional bonuses are given from them.\nAnd that actually goes for most of the side activities - all of them feel kinda useless (unless you are grinding for that next car part).\nI wish Avalanche Studios had more time (or freedom?) to try and go crazy with this game - there's so much potential and possibilities of fun things in there.\n\nAnd then there are those little details everywhere - like burning send left from fuel flying out of your old car's exhaust. Or like storms (that are very rare), but damn terrifying to be in.\nOr like the explosions that looks absolutely gorgeous. And capture mode that makes exploding things and making screenshots very fun (I wish there was a way to get into it using a hotkey, not through pause menu though).\nVoice acting's pretty good too. Oh, and don't forget the optimization - game runs perfectly well on just about any config that's close to recommended one.\n\nSo, to sum it up - if you are OK with your typical (I just can't force myself to say "classic") open world game in Mad Max universe - go for it. It's pretty good, just more of the same good open world stuff in another universe.\n\nWatch the video for more detailed look here:\nhttps://youtu.be/L_Uo3h3nnyE","September 6, 2015","true","20.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Also, the reward for beating story mode is an unlock for the pristine V8 interceptor completely canon from the films.\n\nI'M NOT A MAD MAX FANBOY, WHY SHOULD I GIVE A ♥♥♥♥?\n\nEven if you're not a Max fanboy this game is just fun as ♥♥♥♥. It should be called NEED FOR SPEED: PSYCHOPATHS. It's an Australian murder car simulator. There are hotrod driving skinheads all over the desert and your job is to run them over with flamethrowers, harpoon guns, and spiked wheels. You can rip the doors off of cars and harpoon guys out of the driver seat and pull them through the windshield. You can ram the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything until it explodes. When guys jump on your car, you can just blow them into meat confetti with your shotgun. The people who made this game are truly sick. It's WONDERFUL.\n\nYou will chase down and murder a dozen human beings and blow up their cars just for the sake of grabbing a can of dog food, some shotgun shells, and a hood ornament.\n\nWHAT THE ♥♥♥♥, NO MULTIPLAYER?\n\nThis game should never have multiplayer. The amount of death and destruction one person in one car already causes in this game is beautifully horrendous. If they let us all into the world in our murder cars we'd all be harpooning each other and exploding. The devs at Avalanche would be arrested and put on trial for war crimes.\n","September 6, 2015","true","47.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","6","7","3","2"

Well, the door swings both ways. After Shadow of Mordor and now Mad Max, I will make it my business to buy as many Warner Brothers products as I can. Seriously, they show respect to the industry and this game is yet another living testimony to that fact. Avalanche studios (the developer) has outdone themselves and Warner Brothers (the publisher) had the respect of the industry to publish it in this fashion. Excellent work.\n\nSo why pay money for this title?\n1)	The design is conducive to the player having a lot of varied and dynamic fun. Driving, exploring, running, fist fighting, knife fighting, car rallying, hot-air balloon riding, sliding, talking, car upgrading, character progression…you name it, this game has got it. The best thing is, it all comes together seamlessly.\n2)	The detail in the world is amazing and the attention and respect of the lore is equally worthy of praise. You fight someone, there’s a complete description of how that character or enemy fits into the world. You see a base, landmark or resources centre, there’s a complete description of the site’s function and strategic significance. You pick up so-much-as a flash-light, and there is a complete run down of the object. Brilliant detail.\n3)	The dialogue and voice acting is top-notch. I have enjoyed the characters and cut-scenes in this game more than the film on which the game is based (and I loved Fury Road). The genius incorporation of Mad Max discourse and specific idiomatic terms makes you feel part of the world.\n4)	The graphics are great. Not perfect but amazing non-the-less. The fire, explosions, and smoke effects are nothing short of brilliant. It runs on my system at 80 frames per second with no lag while running fraps and Xsplit in the background. Amazing optimisation.\n5)	The driving is extremely cinematic as the combination of graphics, sound design and game-flow produce extremely stimulating encounters.\n6)	It’s a big game. You really do feel like you are embarking on an epic adventure and you are getting plenty of content for your money.\n\nBravo to the folks at Warner Brothers. Bravo you amazing game designers at Avalanche Studios. The only criticism I can possibly muster involves the voice actor for Max. He does a truly great job but his voice is a little too deep. Seriously, that is as negative as I can get and I append the qualifier that the voice actor still does an amazing job within his scope of ability – not his fault he has a deep voice.\n\nKeep it up WB!\n","September 3, 2015","true","42.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/femboyancy/recommended/234140/","femboyancy","♥Princess Vaxi♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/femboyancy/","510 products in account","Mad Max is a game set in a world where careless waste, political terrorism, and general public unhappiness was permitted to boil over into full out rage, leaving the world a scarred, barren wasteland.\nThe world of Mad Max, is completely different, from the world you and I know. The world you delve into in this game, is ruled by violence, governed by strife, fueled by crude oil, gasoline, and rig job cars built for war, and the only living one does here, is a filthy, misserable, dry-mouthed and perpually starving one, but in this world, simply being alive is a luxury few can claim to own. In this world, a car is required to be anyone or anything, including alive, and nothing but death, and dry bones await those with no car to carry them over the seemingly endless dunes of sand, which have long since covered the unfortunate would-be's who tried to survive before them. Money is worthless here, little more than tinder. The only thing people care about here, the only thing one could safely call 'money'. Is scrap metal. Piles of it, things used to create more cars, and therefore, more survival.\n\nThe game is set in an obscure area in future America, seemingly in an old refinery town long since lost to the sands of sorrow. The only thing still standing, and furiously customized to grow to a sorry, pathetic excuse for a community, is Gastown, a large refinery that still stands and pumps gasoline, natural gas, and oil from the ground below at reckless speeds to fuel the governing group of lunatics, psychopaths, and bestial, carnage worshipping madmen: The War Boys of Scrotus. Much of the game happens in the southern outskirts of this town, a small 'oasis' that, upon arrival in it, seems more like a cruel joke, this area is a small space in the middle of what seems to be an endless expense of send dunes, extending for as long and as far and as unforgivingly constant as the eye can see no matter how high into the sky you go(with airballoon included). Wastelanders and Madmen alike refer to this ocean of endless death and barren dryness that surrounds their homeland as "The Big Nothing", and is routinely referred to as the place desperate people go, not to seek a better life, no matter what they themselves think, but to die. Some rumors say that the oceans which used to fill the entire area, which receeded many many many years ago, still recide far far beyond the Big Nothing, and if one survives the trek across it, they'll be rewarded with a sight of an endless ocean, stretching as far, if not further, than the big nothing, a never ending blanket of pure blue. Many have tried to seek this, and have never been heard from again, which only spurs the rumors on.\n\nGameplay:\nFirst of all, yes, this game is an open world action RPG game with a garnish of crash car derby style gameplay.\nYou play between driving and on-foot exploring most of the time. Long-range weaponry like handguns or rifles are a thing of the past, and extremely rare. Few rifles exist, and even few small arms. The only shotgun seemingly in existence for hundreds or thousands of miles around is Max's own.\nDriving is by far the most entertaining, but also the most difficult, requiring some driving skill depending on what surface you drive on, what tire type your car has on, and how much armor you wear(Cause armor is heavy and might make you stuck in the sand!). Car combat is a fine-tuned dance between excellence, and complete failure, it is almost impossible to be 'sort of successful' or 'sort of failure'.\nOn foot is more straight forward. Mad Max is not just the name of the game, but also the protagonist whom you play. He is indeed mad, and is prone to bouts of uncontrolable rage towards those who attack him, sending him into a state the war-like factions call 'Kamicrazy'. He is, despite his lunacy, extremely skilled at hand to hand combat, and is capable of downing dozens of manic enemies with little effort(Assuming you're good at the game).\n\nThe game has lots of content, many side missions, and countless things to do and see in the world. From lowering the presense of the incredibly powerful and horrificly aggressive faction called 'The Warboys of Scrotus', to progressing the main story of helping Max rebuild his lost 'Black on Black' car, which he loses in the prelude to the game's beginning. A new car, which he begins to build with the help of his newly found friend and ally, Chumbucket, the hunchbacked 'black finger' super mechanic, who knows little more than twisted, gas-combustion based religion, and making engines go vroom and wheels to spin. This car is named by Chumbucket, and is named 'The Magnum Opus'. Foretold by Chum to become 'faster, stronger, and better in every way, than the black on black, filled with holy purpose.'\n\n\nGraphics:\nNote that these graphics are based on a powerful 4k gaming rig with a GTX 980ti graphics card\nThe graphics are appropriate for the game, requiring not much in the way of fauna or foliage since no plants seemingly exist in the world, anywhere. There is just dust, rock, and crude oil oceans made up of saturated sand. The graphics can be good, without being crazy, and still look amazingly detailed and more than adequate for giving a very realistic, very high caliber experience. Based on what I can tell, it appears that a lower grade rig could play this game at lower settings than highest/max, but it's always a good idea to google 'can I run it' and see what that says about your chances.\n\nSound:\nIt supports 7.1 surround sound, which is pretty flipping wonderful. I wish more games did. It gives an extremely realistic settings that makes you feel like you're standing in the middle of it. Of course you'd need 7.1 capable headphones, which mine are. Other than that, there's no desyncing between the voices and the animation of the mouthes, and the sound quality is very high, from both voice actors' skill, to the sounds taken for engines, and metal grinding against metal.\n\nFinal word:\nI'm sure all of you want me to answer this question: "Do you recommend it or not!?" And yes, I absolutely do. I have little to nothing bad to say about this game. Extremely well executed, extremely well put together, an overall victory of considerable magnitude for the developpers responsible for this fine-polished diamond of a video game. If you like steampunky, violent, bitter and gorey messy games that takes unbearable living conditions, and makes them the norm for human survival and living style? Then this game will surely scratch that itch for guzzoline guzzling, oil burning, oil slicked finger licking car games that many of us have.\nI, for one, have been absolutely addicted to this game for the past 4 days, and I see no end to the game yet.","February 14","true","49.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","1"

In fact , its the best movie-tie-in game  I've ever played which you really do feel like Max on a post-apocalyptic wasteland . My opinion about this game is like a tug of war and it really does have its highs and lows .\n\nHighs\nBeautiful setting - Although it really is a wasteland , it doesn't feel that repettive . The game developers try there best to make the experience of driving around the wasteland actually more entertaining with each region have a unique character to it . Alogn with change of weather and nighttime.\nGritty Combat - Akrham-y combat mechanic without the cool gadgets and kungfu moves  . When your playing Max , the only combat experience is your two fists and boy it really does feel good suckerpunch a godamn war boy in face .\nWorld - If you like the crazyness of the franchise, then this game gives that same lust of insanity and madness that we all crave with specific tribes with there own culture and beliefs . Typical Mad Max trope to survive by scavenging scraps , food and water is also the main theme for this game.\nCar mechanics and Combat - The soul of this whole franchise and this game is the car combat . Its basically Pimp-My-Ride with your sidekick Chumbucket as xzibbit . Car Combat is as entertaining as it gets especially when you high tail a convoy all by yourself , rampaging through dozens of cars jsut to get that head ornament as the cherry on top of your sweet Magnum Opus .\nStory - This is probably in the middle but like any Mad MAx movie . It is kept pretty simple with a clear objective\n\nLows\nThe Grind - This is the bad apart about customizing your car , to upgrade the best parts for it you have to start doing small missions by destorying camps and clearing the region which is a chore especially if majority are almost the same . This is what BREAKS ME for this game , its tiring &repetitive and I had to take a long rest from playing this game before going at it again .\nTHE DOG IS USELESS - At first when I saw the dog at the first part of the game you'll be like " hell yeah , Dog partner in wasteland just like Road Warrior " NOOOOOOPPPEEEE . The only thing that dog does in this game is to sniff out mines and there is no reward other then clearing the region out of doing this . It is menial and boring as heck .\nMini-Boss are the SAME- THroughout parts of each region theres a mini-boss camps for you to beat to get that sweet paintjob on your crib but my god is it boring . Each Mini-boss has the same moves , body and mask and it is repetitive and lazy which makes the game almost a cakewalk .\nVerdict\nOverall , its really not a bad game but for those who enjoy a collectathon with a same-y sandbox gameplay with added car combat and collecting while experiencing post-apocalyptic franchise then you would love this game but for me it felt like chore .","February 25","false","38.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

The animation is smooth, such as when Max swaps positions with Chumbucket, his entering and leaving a vehicle as well as the flow of his attacks just feels genuine. There are a lot of video settings combined with the fact that the visuals itself looks pretty good and the presence of rebindable keys is even better. However, there is no toggle aim for those who like it, though this game does not feature very much shooting in general which does not really impact the gameplay for me, despite my personal preference.\n\nNow for the bad points.\n\nThe gameplay in general is quite stale and at times quite pointless. The ground combat is its weakest point, and I give it a 1/10. It largely resembles the Batman fighting style where you spam left click while waiting for counter attack indicators or non-counterable indicators at which you then just dodge. With the attacks, you have light and heavy, but most of the time you end up just spamming light attacks as you cannot dodge while in the middle of charging up a heavy swing, which means heavy swings are reduced to largely finishing off opponents or when there are no undefendable attackers. And in the end, regardless of whether there are defendable or undefendable opponents, it's still a left click spam fest with very little thought input. With an added note that boss fights are exactly the same, just one big guy instead of many smaller guys. One word: Tedium.\n\nThe car combat was also quite uninspiring. It had potential, but the biggest problem was that it ended up being a Harpoon Simulator 2015... on land. Instead of harpooning fish or sharks, you just harpoon buildings and people (in cars and out of them). Ramming into other cars while driving is pretty difficult, while also taking substantially longer to kill opponents as opposed to just harpooning them; though damage greatly increases if you were to run directly into them while boosting. So the easiest way is to just harpoon the people out of the vehicles which leaves you to freely destroy/ram stationary vehicles which explode into meagre amounts of scrap.\n\nNow some general problems.\n\nFuel is something that's used to run your car (obviously), and you'd think in a post-apocalyptic world it would be a very valuable resource... except it isn't when you can basically find an unlimited supply of jerry cans at every balloon fast travel point. Added to that fact that your car also does not even use up that much fuel when it travels, means that the extra jerry can in the back ends up being more of a door opener than anything else.\n\nCapturing camps generally has three objectives, blow up x things, disable y or kill z boss. And there's only two approach to all of these objectives, force your way through via the front gate with your car, or find a side hole to just walk through. Then basically the gameplay becomes all the same because you're forced into ground combat which becomes a tedium (as described above).\n\nThere are also some pointless mechanics such as: spam x to break open door/crate, or, 'this door requires explosives' when there's a jerry can basically right next to you.\n\nOverall.\n\nThere's no stealth mechanic nor grabbing attacks which forces a very linear gamestyle, your guns are more or less just there to do objectives rather than supplement combat flow, car combat becomes a harpoon simulation, while the concept of fuel as a resource becomes moot. If you like the Batman series fighting styled gameplay, then this might be for you.","September 3, 2015","false","9.6"," 263 of 501 people (52%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","52","263","501","16","25"

This is your typical sandbox as well as a literal one - you drive in a box across miles on miles of sand. And that is the game's problem. Sandbox games require lots of interensting or funny content. And it requires motivation. This game does have quite some content scattered around and if you count by numbers it's not bad, but the thing is, the map is way bigger. It is true to the series, lore, which is good, but not good for the game, especially, when existing content is not really that interesting. Besides, gameplay revolves too much around the car. Again - good for the lore, not so good for the game. Even though you have a goal, like to reach a certain place, yada-yada, in reality you still are doiong all this in order to pimp your ride.

Its open world is sprawling, its driving fantastic, and its melee action is simple, but effective. The problem with Mad Max, if you can call it that, is that it's filled with "filler" content. Tasks that seem there just to give you something to extend your playtime. Some of it is fun, others (like mine fields) are pretty uninspired.\n\nIn the end though, Mad Max is still a good game. I just hope it's the beginning of a franchise, one that can grow and become something even better.","September 3, 2015","true","21.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Mad Max. Id never seen the movies until I bought this game and playing it made me watch Mad Max 1 and 2 tonight. I didn't even know about this game until a friend mentioned he was quite hyped close to release. I waited until after release to buy it actually due to the "wonderful" launch of Arkham Knight (sarcasm). But in all seriousness this game has slapped me in the face and proven me wrong.\n\nI have enjoyed 37 hours of Mad Max so far and I have not enjoyed a game this much since one of the Assassins Creed games which im not going to go in detail about as I am not here to promote AC. Every new title that comes out nowadays gets me worrying about optimization and whether the game will actually be in any way playable at launch. Mad Max is 100% playable and 99.9% bug free. A 2MB update could fix the only issues the game currently has and the best part is that the bugs aren't game breaking! The gameplay is extremely fun all the way through and even though im a guy im not afraid to admit that the main story has some emotion in it. There were moments that I actually gasped in shock lol. The driving is very smooth and I would compare it alot to GTA's style of driving but it feels like driving the Batmobile from Arkham Knight quite a bit when it comes to vehicle control and drifting etc. The vehicle customisation is great. You can change every little piece of your car to your liking but it comes at a price of course. Combat. Once again very like Warner Bros Batman Arkham combat although you do notice the difference in moves and overall let's say "gore"? Yeah gore. So ive actually completed the main story now and I was worried that when it is done will I still play Mad Max? Yes is the answer. The main story may be complete but still I had only 43% completed the game. It was beautfiul in it's own way. When it comes to character customization I would choose the word endless. You can change Max's facial hair, his head gear, wrist armor, jacket, gun and unlock new fighting moves. So after watching the first 2 Mad Max movies I would compare the game to Mad Max 2 the most. I was watching the very long car battle near the end and right away I was getting flashbacks of vehicle combat in the video game! Even the map/scenery makes me feel like im a part of the 2nd movie.\n\nMost interesting feature of the game:\n\nChumbucket. This is a character you meet in the game. After meeting him he leeches onto you and never goes away. After 45 minutes of playing you are very thankful to have him there. 3000 pieces of scrap later you are extremely happy to have him with you because your car will begin to look beautful because of him. He is very helpful throughout the game and got me through some situations. Ive usually found that having a character like this who constantly is with you in a game gets annoying. It's like Roman from GTA IV. "Hey Nico! Want to bowling?". I know Roman wasn't physically there but he still got me trying to find subways so I could escape the world of phone signal. Although Chumbucket knows what he is doing. He knows when to speak and when to shut the hell up. That's always a great thing. Right?\n\nSooooo graphics! Beautiful! Some may shoot me virtually for this but im gonna compare this game to the Arkham Knight graphics. I know ive compared it to Batman enough but seriously it is the best and most accurate example and it's by Warner Bros for god sake! Honestly the graphics are great. The game is very well optimized and im extremely shocked that it is due to more recent games and their examples. Warner Bros have done a great job at recreating the Mad Max world for us to free roam around in with our rumbling V8 engines. Good job. And yeah here is the gretaest part of all for people worrying if they can run this game. Im using an AMD Radeon HD 7870 with an AMD FX 6350 on high 1920x1080. No stutters no lag and 30fps+.\n\nAlso on the main menu I see a DLC tab. The excitement is real and the wallet is open!\n\n9/10","September 6, 2015","true","51.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

But was bit confused after i saw the movie Mad Max Fury Road. But I decided to pick it up and give it a go. And I wasn't disappointed.  What a game. Although I didn't have much time to play, but here are my thoughts after playing . And Wil include more in depth analysis\n\nPros:\n-Good Optimization. Runs perfectly on my laptop with GTX 860M GPU\n- Brutal Yet Addicte combat System. Batman arkham series would find it more interesting\n- Vast Vast Wasteland to cover .\n- Love The Cusomization.\n-Fun to do quests and finding scraps.\n-Fuel system and water system is damn good.  Really liked it. It forces me to focus on the game\n- Survival at its best\n\nCons:\n- Sometimes the gamplay can be a bit repetitive.\n- There should be an speedometer :3 . It's good to see the how fast ur car can go.\n- Story Is a bit disooriented .\n\n\n\nOne thing just popped up in my mind. There could be a multiplayer system of mad max. There could be Online races, car combats among the players like carmeggadon.  There could have been some crews formed among players and fighting among  the crews over the territory control .It would gave the game a big edge and could have make it a bit more interesting and different from many games. I hope devs will listen to us.\n\n\nThe fact is, it will push you to the limits. U can take risk but it has to calculative. Any wrong move and your car is done for sure.  And It's even risky to stay out open in the wasteland. Either Snipers or the cars will kill u for sure :3. Need to keep u r canteen filled up or eat a dead body for food"all these things just made me fall in love of this game.  Let's see how it ends up!","September 2, 2015","true","6.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","4"

Mad Max is wonderfully optimised I get an average of 80fps at 1440p on a single 970 which is quite an achievement in this day and age considering the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ports we are getting in the past few years. Story is interesting but I will update the review after I complete it. Apart from main missions there are quite a few activities in the wasteland ranging from capturing bases(far cry style but better) to taking down sniper nests and so on but I like the random encounters quite a lot.

This is your typical sandbox as well as a literal one - you drive in a box across miles on miles of sand. And that is the game's problem. Sandbox games require lots of interensting or funny content. And it requires motivation. This game does have quite some content scattered around and if you count by numbers it's not bad, but the thing is, the map is way bigger. It is true to the series, lore, which is good, but not good for the game, especially, when existing content is not really that interesting. Besides, gameplay revolves too much around the car. Again - good for the lore, not so good for the game. Even though you have a goal, like to reach a certain place, yada-yada, in reality you still are doiong all this in order to pimp your ride. For me - it's not a motivation. This should be a side show and not the main dish.\nTechnically, the game is not that bad. It looks good. Controls, even though a bit weird are fine. Although I am having issues with counter-attacks - it seems to be reacting with delay. ANd overall the quality of the game in general is good. If it was a linear game, a smaller one I think I would have been able to enjoy it, even though dialouges are like from the b-movies. Still, in sense, true to the origin.\nI am marking this as recomended, since Steam does not give us much choice, but I would recomend it to fans only. It does have a proper atmosphere.

So I'm opting to talk about what I don't like here instead.\nThis is, of course, personal opinion, just because I don't like something doesn't make it bad.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nThe on-foot combat mechanics... I believe someone said they are "reminiscent of the Batman: Arkham series". If by 'reminiscent' you mean 'practically torn straight out', then I'm inclined to agree. The mechanics aren't bad or anything, it's just kind of disappointing that they more or less copy/pasted the brawling instead of trying to make something a little more unique.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nCertainly a more personal gripe, but I find the open-world collectible-hunting to be very tiresome. People compare it to Just Cause 2, and I see what they mean. Problem is, I gave up on JC2's collectibles less than 15% of the way through finding them all because I got bored of basically looking for the same few things over and over and over again in a colossal playable area where it was kind of difficult to distinguish one section of the world from any other save a few landmarks here and there. I'm not even quite finished with finding all the things in the first main area of Mad Max, and it's wearing thin.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nThe bosses. Good god do I hate the bosses so far.\n\nSee, I always imagined that if a Mad Max game was going to have bosses, they would be awesome. Like, each boss would actually have tangible importance, each would have a unique look, voice, personality, specialization. Most importantly though, they would have an awesome mobile death fortress of some kind, and the showdown with them would include a huge running battle where you have to use all the tools at your disposal to pick apart their defenses one piece at a time while dodging smaller support and assault vehicles before finally delivering the killing blow.\n\nThe vehicle for each boss would be unique and require different strategies, and the baddies themselves would have enough backstory that you'd know why they need to die outside of the usual "me good, they bad, they need go boom" deal. Finally, when you killed them, it would matter. Enemies that once served under that boss would be more likely to either run from you in terror or go kamikaze in hopes of a glorious death against a worthy foe. NPCs would tell (probably exaggerated) stories around campfires of how you took down some of the scariest dudes in the wastes like it was nothing.\n\nMaybe even have a sort of Crackdown-esque kinda deal where each boss provided some important service that strengthened the final villain you'd have to face, and each one you took down would make the final challenge just that much easier.\n\nSo, what are the two bosses I've faced so far? Well...\nThe first boss was a huge dude with a gimp mask and an oversized mace that attacked by charging at me and swinging said mace.\nThe second boss was a huge dude with a gimp mask and an oversized mace that attacked by charging at me and swinging said mace... and he had a bit of paint splattered on him and there were some random goons and jets of fire.\n\nI honestly could not tell you what the name of either boss was or what they had to do with anything. For all I know, they had nothing to do with Scrotus and were just upset because I walked into their favorite BDSM club and started murdering everyone. Considering I seem to be at least 20% through the game, and the only bosses so far seem pointless and practically identical, I get the feeling I'm going to be fighting Mr. Gimp's several other identical twins in more-or-less matching uniforms before the end of the game.\n\nPerhaps I'll be pleasantly surprised by a unique and interesting boss at some point, but even so... it's a really terrible first impression, and it makes me wonder whether fighting the bosses is really going to be worth it.\n\nI'm not looking forward to fighting Mr. Gimp VI with his fedora, and his gimmick weakness that sounds like the devs just wrote up slips of paper listing every way an enemy can die, put them in a hat, picked one at random and said "Okay, so you have to kill this boss by performing shiv executions on him over and over again. Otherwise you'll have spend 3 hours whittling his health down with those shriveled mouse testicles you call knuckles".\n\n-----------------------------\n\nOn the topic of things that are terrible, what I thought was a glitch during a boss fight, I now believe be be the result of a very poor design choice (though I might be wrong). Whatever it is, I hope it gets patched out.\n\nSee, the first time I fought the first boss, I died after running out of shotgun shells and dodging at the wrong moment one too many times. I respawned right outside the boss arena, and was ready to go in and give it another shot... when I realized I had no shotgun shells, despite having had a full load of four when hitting the checkpoint before the boss. The boss, of course, had full health (I expected that would be the case). I thought this was just an awful glitch. Later, I was driving around and boosted at the wrong second in the wrong place, and died as a result. Before the screen confirming that I had, in fact, not survived falling several dozen meters popped up, I noticed that the game autosaved as my corpse burned in the wreckage.\n\nNow, I know nothing about the fine details of programming a game, or how save systems work. But I am thinking that what happened during that boss fight earlier is that I used up all of my ammo and died, and the game decided to autosave the state of my resources at the time of my death, then punt me back to the last checkpoint with the same amount of resources I had upon dying. Which would be expected if this was made by FromSoftware, but it's not. Having your head splattered with a mace only to resurrect a short distance away might fit the Dark Souls lore, but it doesn't really mesh with the Mad Max universe, I think. If you die, you're dead. Ergo, when you load the last checkpoint/autosave, it ought to be as if everything after that point in time never happened.\n\n(tl;dr plz fix autosaving on death so I can find something else to whine about)\n\n-----------------------------\n\nTo wrap things up, I'm going to change gears and relay the most awesome moment I've experienced with the game so far:\n\nDriving to a minefield with the turdbuggy, dog in tow and only two shotgun shells on me.\nA wild Scrotemobile appears!\n"♥♥♥♥. Just what I need right now."\nGet in front of him, try to line up a shot through the windsheild, but the shotgun decides it wants to try targetting his rear left tire for some reason.\nRealizing that I'm going offroad, I look forward to avoid driving off a cliff or smashing into something.\nBarely swerve left to avoid ramming into a pillar.\nWeird physics stuff happens, resulting in the buggy spinning around a couple dozen times at mach 10 before landing in a perfect stop on all four wheels facing the exact opposite direction I had been driving.\nI instantly start aiming with the shotgun in hopes of killing the enemy driver, causing the game to go into bullet time.\nApparantly, the baddie hit a bump and went flying through the air.\nThe exact instant the game slowed down for aiming purposes, the Little Scrotemobile That Could torpedo'd the pillar with all the force of a great typhoon, resulting in what I can only refer to as 'what would happen if Michael Bay was directing a car chase scene for a Mission Impossible film after having gone three months without beating it to explosions'.\nThere was much rejoicing.\n\nAhh, if only the entire game could bring me that level of amusement...","September 3, 2015","true","13.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borba/recommended/234140/","Borba","Borba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borba/","1717 products in account","TL:DR at the end, scored 8 / 10 as of 31st October 2015\nBorba likes:Genre - Third person action adventure in an open world environment. Sporting on foot and vehicular combat, progression through upgrades and exploration,with repetitive side missions and objectives.\n\nNarrative - Being a fan of the Mad Max universe, the story was spot on and the characters were distinctive and interesting. The overall plot was somewhat unpredictable, although a bit short, and the ending felt rushed and unimaginative.\n\nGameplay - The on foot combat has similarities to Batman series' combat. You chain attacks with possible finishers and executions, parry when a visual cue appears, dodge roll and may use your firearm or enemies' weapons. Vehicular combat is more interesting, with targeted damage and several ways of destroying or disabling vehicles. Overall, its easy to learn and satisfying to perform.\n\nInterface - Obviously designed for consoles and gamepads, it performs solidly for keyboard and mouse users, despite being a bit buggish when accessing the garage to upgrade and swaping to the archangels section.\n\nGraphics - Taking into account Mad Max's apocalyptic world consists mostly of sand, rock and some metal, there are plenty details and landmarks to take in, and some interesting biomes to discover. The game is well optimized and looks great, in a grim and depressing way.\n\nMusic - Both eerie and discrete during exploration, it quickly shifts into an energetic and tribal tone during combat. Borba considers it perfect in setting the mood for this universe.\n\nSound - From simple sounds such as footsteps, to the crunchy combat and spectacular ambient effects, it adds much to the whole game experience and immersion.\n\nPolish - Going against the trend of ill-optimized triple A titles and the "release now, patch later" attitude, the game released with very few issues, and none that prevented Borba to perform a full playthrough within the first week of release. Despite a couple of graphics driver crashes that occurred, no save data was lost and the game's performance is consistent on high settings.\nBorba dislikes:Replayability - After finishing the story, Max gets back on the map so he can find all collectibles, get all upgrades and finish all challenges. Despite that, Borba doesn't feel compelled to do another playthrough, and feels this end game should provide more enemies to fight on foot and on vehicle, perhaps in the form of several arenas or more varied challenges.\n\nDesign - This, is what separates a mediocre game from something truly special. Overall, Mad Max is pretty mediocre as an open world action adventure game due to the fact it has such repetitive side quests that provide an obligatory grind to get the upgrades needed for the main quest line. Solid and fun game mechanics ( combat ) mitigate this situation, but one can only wish there was more love put into the enemy strongholds ( fighting the same bosses in different environments doesn't cut it for Borba ) and more interesting dialogue into the encounters with friendly characters. Maybe with some DLC, introducing new things to do ( arenas and on foot / vehicle combat challenges! ) other than finding collectibles, completing the map and racing challenges.\nBorba feels like despite Mad Max being a solid game with fun combat and many upgrades to unlock, it could have been so much more than a wasteland grind for completionists such as himself. If unsure, consider the game when it gets a good discount, for it is still a solid game that looks as well as it runs, great!\n\n8/10","September 23, 2015","true","55.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's like Far Cry 3 in that you have to take camps so allies can occupy them, and it's like Rage with the way enemies come at you on the road. There are also strongholds that serve as home bases, and there are various ways of building them up so they serve Max better. I've seen some reviews claiming it's too survival heavy because ammo, water, etc, is scarce, but if you build up the strongholds, you really don't have to worry about all that and just have fun wreaking havoc.\n\nScrap metal is a necessity if you're to upgrade your car and even yourself so you can handle the increasing difficulty of the game.\n\nI feel this game nails what it set out to do, which was put the player in a Mad Max world, and I especially love the car battles! I keep wanting to gather more scrap so I can turn my car into more of a beast, and this need is also the driving force to do favors for others, which moves the story along and keeps the action pumped.\n\nThe characters are fun and well-acted, and the Batman-type combat is fluid.

Eventually all the side activities do feel like just some extra padding and get quite dull unless you're a completionist, but to be honest that's a problem with many open world games nowadays.\n\nThe car handling is perhaps the biggest problem, I honestly thought that my car generally felt slippery and sluggish...slippery as in easily entering a spin whenever I hit an object as if my car was an empty eggshell rather than a fully armoured beast and sluggish due to its generally bad turning radius and bad acceleration (upgrades that add weight makes it worse ofc). But driving around and car combat, while suffering a bit from the aforementioned issues, do manage to stay fun and that's what matters: the only exception is a badly designed and unskippable car race where the handling problems come up pretty badly, thankfully some pointers on the forums'll help you making it more manageable.\n\nAll things considered Mad Max is a pretty good game and one that'll last you for quite some time before the repetitiveness sets in and you decide to just finish the story: you can already find it for way less than its full price and I can easily recommend it if you're looking for more third-person action but want something different than Assassin's Creed.","September 9, 2015","true","33.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Usually, I tend to avoid games based on movies, because more than often they are rushed titles whose only purpose is to sell using the name of the movie. So, what happened that made me change my mind about buying such a potentially bad game? Mainly, Steam reviews. With a solid 90% positive reviews I thought to give the game a chance, besides I'm also a big fan of Mad Max movies, a post apocalyptic genre lover and the game was 66% discounted during Christmas. I bought it and it was a real, amazing surprise.\n\nTECHNICAL ASPECTS\n***GAMEPLAY 8/10\nMad Max gameplay is amazing, but unfortunately it is flawed by some aspects that may bore the gamers. As I said, the game is open-world, Max can travel by foot (not a very good nor smart idea), by car (best idea) or by fast travel (anti-boredom idea). Why is fast travel anti boredom? Simply because the world is HUGE, it's like Skyrim but in a desert with almost no life, so even with a car, but nothing to do it gets boring. The environment is really well made, don't get me wrong, I tried to avoid using fast travel (I'm not a big fan of it), but if you want to 100% complete the game, traveling, even with your fastest car, becomes a nuisance.\nNow, let's talk about fighting. Take the Batman Arkham franchise, strip the Bat of it's costume, grow Wayne a big bushy beard, give him some ragged clothes, a double barrel shotgun and throw him in a desert, done ? Good, you now have Max, a man that fights (kinda) like the Gotham vigilante. What is great about this in Mad Max is that you can perform some finisher moves depending on the environment. Is your enemy with his back against a wall ? Grab his head and smash it on said wall. Is your enemy the sniper in that tall tower that just blow up one of your car tires? Find a way to sneak up on him and push him over the ledge of his tower, no more sniping for you ... Baiatch ! Do you like the sound of your shotgun? Grab an enemy and gut shot him... again, and again, and again, and ... damn I ran out of ammo.\nOnce your enemies are all dead you can go back to your car and chill out... wait no ... a war party approaching !!! Fighting in Mad Max doesn't end when you enter your car, it really begins there. If you have seen the 2015 movie you know what I'm talking about, if not go buy the DVD and then buy the game (I'm not joking). Car fights are almost exactly like the ones you see in the movie: ramming, grinding, burning, harpooning, blowing up tires, fuel tanks or drivers. The only problem about cars is that the game doesn't like to see cars upside down, so whenever you flip your car and start sliding on your hood, some mystical force flips your car back on its wheels.\nAll of this you'll be able to do by buying the right upgrade for Max or the car, there are a lot of them. For Max there are the classic upgrades : better armour, more HPs, special combos, etc. For the car there are car bodies, tires, ramming grills, engines, hood ornaments, harpoons, spikes (to impale enemies that try to jump on your car) pipes that shoot flames and much more. Each upgrade will cost you scrap (the currency of the game), you get scrap by completing missions, looting enemies or locations and by destroying enemy vehicles. It is hard to have enough at the beginning, but doing side missions helps you a lot and eventually you end up having more than you need.\nLast thing I'll explain about gameplay is what made the Steam reviews drop from 97% positive to 90% : the lack of diversity for what concerns side missions. In Mad Max you have the possibility of roam free around the map doing things like destroying enemy convoys or liberating outposts. Although these things are fun and give you the opportunity of doing something other than the main quest, they are basically all the same, they just get a bit harder the more you go on. These enemy outposts for example, are different only in their appearance, one is inside a chasm, while another was built on an abandoned oil rig. The problem is that you always have to do the same thing, fight your way among enemies and blow things up or kill the boss. Here, the bosses, or I should say "big guys who look all the same except for the colour of their clothes", this is the worst thing of the game, these guys are supposed to be generals, not cannon fodder, so I expect them to be unique, to fight in different ways, to die in different ways, well... no, they are all the same, they fight all in the same way, and you kill them in the same way.\n\n***STORY and LORE 9/10\nIt's not the main thing of the game obviously, but I guess it's noticeable by the fact that I wrote a poem about the gameplay and almost nothing about the story. However, it is good, not excellent but good enough, it follows up the event of the movie but doesn't cross them, so the game and the movie remain separated but in the same context. It also seems that George Miller, the director and inventor of Mad Max, supervised some aspects of the game, the lore in particular, I've read that he likes the idea of being allowed to explain things (in a game for example) that you cannot explain in a movie (for obvious reason of time). So, when going around doing quests you come across some "relics" that give you hints on what happened to the world. When you start the game you may think you're in a desert in Australia, but it's not just a desert it's  the bottom of the ocean, now dry due to some mysterious event, (probably global warming) .\nIf you want a short summary of the story keep reading (I won't spoil anything important)\nThe game starts with Max driving his beloved Interceptor, you get attacked by Scrotus (one of Immortan Joe sons) you manage to kill Scrotus but your car gets stolen and scrapped. Then, you encounter a hunchback named Chumbucket, a blackfinger (title given to those who are skilled mechanics), who wants to help you because he says to have seen you in a vision and thinks you're the "Saint" (an envoy of the goddess called Angel Combustion). He builds a new car, the Magnum Opus and comes with you to help you get a V8 engine that is supposed to allow you to continue your journey through the desert.\nDuring the game you come across other characters, some crazier than others, who help you if, of course, you help them first and you do that until you reach Gastown. What happens then, I let you discover by yourself.\n\n***GRAPHICS 10/10\nAmazing, nothing less. Even though it's not perfect I give the game a 10 because it runs at a steady 60fps on (Mad)Max settings 99% of the time, I dropped under 50 only twice, but there was really a lot going on on screen. The game is so well optimized that makes other AAA games look bad. Everything about the environment is unique, each region has its unique features and look. You don't have the impression of being in the same place, even though you're in a desert with only rocks, sand and some scattered ruins, but what really shines here are the storms.\nStorms are random events that can occur when you are out in the open, your companion Chumbucket will scream "Storm approaching !" and will point in that direction, you move the camera and you see it : a front of black clouds of dust moving towards you at incredible speed. You may try to outrun it and find somewhere to hide, but you'll miss all the fun, so pedal to the metal and run inside the storm. Everything turns black for a second, the wind howling covers even the sound of the engine, lightning starts falling from the sky and you have to steer to avoid being hit... it is so damn fun, if you manage to find some crazy enemy inside a storm is even better.\n\n***SOUND 9/10\nI'm running out of space to write so I'll just say that sound is great: engines, explosions, bone breaking or dislocating, car grinding to each other. Best part of it is voice acting.\n\nOVERALL SCORE 9/10","January 31","true","65.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Driving over sand dunes while the sun sets, exploring desolate locations,races, liberating camps, story and side missions etc. The first time you experience a massive sand/thunder storm is pretty amazing, you can either seek shelter and wait for it to pass to try to survive it and collect massive rewards. Things like that only re-enforce the perception that the wasteland is tough to survive in. The wasteland is a great example of how good art direction and design can take a seemingly boring environment and turn it into something special.\n\n+ Scavenging locations and liberating camps throughout the wasteland allows you to collect scrap which can then be used to upgrade your character or your vehicle the magnum opus\n\n+ Lots of different challenges to complete, completing challenges grants you special tokens which can then be used to further upgrade your character.\n\n+ Car combat is a big component of the game and destroying vehicles feels very satisfying. You can destroy enemy vehicles in a variety of ways.\n\n+ Chumbucket, your loveable yet strange hunchback sidekick. The most interesting and fun character in the game.\n\n+ Incredibly well optimized, plenty of graphical options\n\n+ Lots of side quests, collectables, missions, races etc that are varied and provide a nice distraction from the main quest.\n\n+ Great soundtrack and sound effects.\n\nThe Average:\n\nThe combat is a shallow version of Rocksteady's Batman games. There isn't enough gameplay mechanics or depth tied to the combat so the majority of the time you are only punching or parrying attacks with the occasional dodge. Even when you upgrade your combat skills, it doesn't feel like much has changed. Parrying an attack isn't instant so many times you will be in the middle of an attack only to be punched/charged from behind. This is further aggravated by the camera angle which is zoomed in to close to the character making it hard to see where all the enemies are.\n\nThe story is decent but nothing really special either, it doesn't stand out but it gets the job done.\n\nThe game is fairly easy especially if you are accustomed to the combat system. I never found the game to be challenging.\n\nSome annoying  glitches, nothing game breaking but every once in a while an enemy will disappear through the floor, characters getting stuck etc.\n\nIf you want to do many of the optional quests, it can start to feel repetitive....like most open world games.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nBoss battles are all the same which is a shame because there is so much potential here.\n\nConclusion:\n\nA fun game that is great if played in short sessions. If you love a collect-a-thon, then you will truly love this game. The good news is you can skip many of the optional stuff and stick to the main story and still have a good time.\n","May 12","true","53.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

I put the game aside due to the general consensus that the game was ‘okay’, however when I did get round to booting up the game - I didn’t play anything else until I finished it! And I don’t get to finish many games…\n\nStory/BackgroundThe main story is a bit meh. The narrative has clearly been written to fit in with the game mechanics (you need to upgrade your car a bunch and you need a buddy riding along with you), though it does get a bit better towards the end.\n\nThe side quests are nice because they have a level of narrative, don’t take too long and there aren’t so many of them that they detract from the main story.\n\nPost-apocalypse themes are always cool. The Mad Max setting is no Fallout. It is very brutal. There is death, violation, drugs and not to mention insane amounts of violence. I’m almost afraid to say I prefer this level of seriousness that almost everyone in this world wants to kill you purely for the fun of it.\n\nMechanicsCombat is truly where the game shines. There are two types; on foot and in car.\n\nGround combat is just like the Batman games but super bloody and delightfully violent. It follows the action mechanic formula of punching and parrying, with weapons and unlockable skills thrown into the mix. Max has a gun, but true to the world, ammo is scarce so I found myself very rarely using it (much more fun to save for use in car combat).\n\nThe car combat mechanics are awesome. The nature of it, though unscripted, comes across as highly cinematic, detailed skirmishes. Intercepting convoys is extremely fun, there’s nothing like scouting out a dust trail from atop a plateau with your ‘long lookers’, getting into your vehicle and T-boning the target car, shooting raiders off your bonnet in the process. Very fun.\n\nProgressionMax and his car are the player’s main focus. Levelling up Max unlocks Max upgrades such as armor and skills. This system is very well done; rather than gathering experience points, you level up by completing challenges (blow up 50 barrels, do a 10-hit combo, etc.). Completing quests and eliminating threats unlocks car upgrades. There are many different combinations, the most expensive upgrades aren’t always the best to use. Sometimes the weaker upgrades are a better choice - they may have less mass, which allows for faster acceleration, for example.\n\nVisualsThe game is beautiful. From far away landmarks, right the way down to sand trails and dust clouds, the level of detail is impressive. There’s even a feature to freeze time and capture screenshots and videos. No loading screens interrupt traversing the huge open world.\n\nSummaryI’ve touched on the parts of this game that spoke out to me the most. If you are a fan of open-world action games, post-apocalyptic themes or good o’ violence ‘n explosions, then I highly suggest buying this. Some patience with the first introductory part is required until the game opens up and becomes much more fun. The game is NOT a survival game, Max is a very capable individual, though a bit simple and predictable - he fights like a total badass.","May 23","true","33.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/boyraceruk/recommended/234140/","boyraceruk","Boy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/boyraceruk/","399 products in account","Much like the cars in it Mad Max looks good but is a bit creaky underneath. This review will probably contain SPOILERS, but only for like the first five minutes because the games a bit repetitive.\n\nFirst, the good:\n\nThis game feels so much like the Batman games I originally thought it was the same developer. Which means the combat is pretty fluid and visceral, you feel like a total badass and it never feels far-fetched that Max is more than capable of taking down ten guys at once.\nThe driving is nice, takes a little getting used to and the cars feel doughy sometimes but flying down the dusty tracks in your hand-built monster is a fun experience.\nThe customisation is spot-on, I was eagerly anticipating having enough scrap for some of the personal or vehicle add-ons and they all make a noticeable difference.\n\nNow for the bad:\n\nMad Max _feels_ like the Batman games but it doesn't look like the Batman games, mainly because the camera is so poor in close quarters that you can't see anything at all. This can lead to getting hit in fights you should be walking simply because the camera decided showing Max and the dude he's fighting is too much work so it points somewhere above their heads. Considering half the combat is in close confines this can get very annoying.\nAlso the enemy design is lacking inspiration. For general mobs there's weak dude, melee weapon dude, fast dude with a knife and shield dude. OK, so there's the occasional suicide bomber and some weird "ferals" who come at you like dogs but mainly you will have a mix of the first four. Bosses are even worse, there is only one type: big, muscley dudes with melee weapons. Oh, one is weak to knives, one is weak to fire, the usual, but you end up beating them all the same way.\nThe vehicle combat is ridiculous. Either you will get ganked super-fast by some dude rubbing up on you or you will be wasting the enemy in seconds. There is no in-between, no long, ongoing games of cat and mouse. If you are in front, no matter how fast your car is, you will be caught. But if your car catches on fire you can bail out and be as dangerous on foot as you were in your vehicle. It makes you wonder why Max needs a car in the first place.\nThe in-game races are very strange, the other racers show little amibition to reach the finish line first, they would rather pick a fight with you. Just you, not each other and certainly not with the other cars you might meet on the road which will be drawn to you like you have a magnet as a hood ornament.\n\nThere are a few more quibbles like Max using his shotgun to bust stuff when he has a crowbar right next to the holster but that's more of a logic flaw then an actual problem with the game itself. In short, the game is fun 80% of the time but the other 20% will have you throwing your gamepad at the wall.","September 12, 2015","true","65.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

Mad Max is a solid and immersive experience, though it does have some significant flaws that prevent it from being amazing. The story is fitting for a Mad Max tale, though like the films, it's the action that makes the game fun. There is some interesting mysticism sprinkled here and there as well.  Max himself fits the reluctant hero archetype very well. His sidekick, Chumbucket, acts great as Max's foil and comic relief to the harshness of the wasteland, which itself is beautifully rendered. There are other characters scattered here and there, though not enough for the player to care for them. Ground combat follows the Batman formula; various finisher unlocks help keep it fresh. Vehicle combat is where the game shines as you can upgrade your car to have some killer weapons and defensive items.\n\n\nPROS:\n-Performance (Best PC port in a long time, looks beautiful, runs smooth)\n-Vehicle Combat (You can harpoon stuff!)\n-Environments (Lots of detail for an open world; the wasteland is filled with all kinds of scenes that tell a story of the apocalypse without having to spell it out for you. Lots of cool and disturbing imagery all around.

Very easy to get lost in this wasteland, much more interesting to me than the other post apocalyptic game right now)\n\nCONS:\n-Side quests too repetitive / too much grinding\n-Lack of End Game content (This is what keeps this game from being amazing; you spent a long time upgrading Max and your car, only for the game to be virtually empty by the time you are ready to be a true Road Warrior. The best vehicular combat scenarios, the convoys, for instance, never respawn. The game is desperately in need of a way to reset enemy camps and convoys, or a New Game+ mode.. not sure this will happen as Avalanche is busy with Just Cause 3)\n-Difficulty (It's pretty easy, and you can make Max pretty overpowered pretty fast - could use a Survival mode of some sort)\n\nOTHER THOUGHTS:\nI'm not a completionist usually, but for this game I didn't want it to end so I did a lot of grinding that I don't like doing.  Note: If you want to 100%, look at the challenges first and plan your attack; if you get rid of all Threat Level in the game too early, it will be very difficult/annoying to complete some of the challenges required. See End Game comments above.\n\nWhere are the War Rigs? Would be awesome if the convoys had big trucks that you had to board. Imagine fighting War Boys on a moving behemoth, before finally taking out the driver and hijacking the truck. Generally this game needs more convoys and maybe even convoy escort missions.","December 9, 2015","true","79.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

You're awesome!\nMovie-based games used to be bad. Well, you could say, its comic-based, but nevertheless, its amazing! For a change upgrades are vitally important. The upgrades you apply to the car are essential and you won't stop collecting and upgrading, believe me. Such a good idea, to be able to upgrade not only Max, but the car also. Upgrades are the best, if the progress tree is designed well. You'll buy the right thing at the right time and feel smart and accomplishing. That's good game design - the perfect illusion of choice. Now the looks:\nEverything you'd expect nowadays is here: depth of field, motion blur, volumetric lighting, ambient occlusion. But the sky steals the show. Its the most beautiful sky in a video game. A great achievement by the designers. Also the landscape, a huge, authentic wasteland without any loading screens. Wow!\n\nSo, how is this game in "relationship-terms"?\n\n-She looks amazing, performs well, if you know what i mean, she cooks, she irons and you'd gladly introduce her to your dad.\n\nInsta-favorite.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menphues/recommended/234140/","Menphues","ℳєηρнυєs ☯ (Kyle)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menphues/","1698 products in account","So my constructive review on Mad Max Game!\n\nAs many of you know about my reviews, I go into more detail than needed but it works out in the end.\n\nSo lets start with the basics:\n\nGraphics: This game is extremely well made on the optimize section. Maxed out graphics is super smooth on my crossfire 7950s and the game does look really nice. I played maxed out at 2560x1440p and the game was smooth as butter, even streaming game it ran smooth without a single problem. The most optimized game to date, better that GTA\nThe graphics in total are decent, really they are nice to look at and has some really cool effects with the glass effect on the cars, dents and scratches. Really well done!\n\nAudio: There is not much to really comment on this, you have car sounds bombing around, but the car sounds do sound pretty nice, with the grumble from the different engines. The main character looks and sounds like the guy from "The Last Of Us" Literally and the music I find annoying, so I turned it off, the overal bumps, sand poof and what not is nothing special.\n\nControls: This is what I do not like at all! The car handles horrible, really... If you ever played APB: Reloaded then you know what I am on about here because it handles about the same! When driving and turning, it's like you are trying to ride an ice cube, down a wet iced path and hit a pin at the end. It's really horrible to drive I think, and takes some time getting used too. The way the character moves aswell is also annoying. You have to be RIGHT infront of the ladder to actually climb it, no matter if you are looking at it and beside it, up against it.. You MUST be directly played infront and sometimes you can just tap the key and the character will dart off an edge or something. The way he moves it annoying!\n\nGameplay: So this is an open world game, kinda sandbox if you will but limited. You have a car, a man and a chum to go on your quest. Lots of missions in the game really are stupid, go here, talk to this man, go back and talk to chum, now chum wants an item, go and get it and come back, but sometimes the items are less than a few feet away, but he STILL wants you to get it, then you get it and it's done, like "THE HELL!!!"\n\nAlso jumping, the character barely jumps over a book and you often find yourself running around things because he cannot get up the size of a paper back book.... I was able to jump around things and yet he could not step over something and it forced me on one path ONLY. The game is kinda linear in that aspect.\n\nShooting.... When you press right click, your character will stop dead in his tracks and you CANNOT, I repeat you CANNOT move at all... You cannot move and shoot, you must stay still.. What the hell is with that I do not know!\n\nYou spend most of the time doing the same missions back and for, talking just to build the car. This game is all about the car parts it seems. Not much about anything else from what I can tell.  So far the missions I have seen has been the same as every other one... Bored me!\n\nThe combat is simple button smash, right click and back to smashing.... Literally batman fight system and it's okay for the first fight, maybe the second but then it's boring!\nThere are no grabbing attacks, holding to counter to attack someone else, using proper fighting... It's simple button smash fighting.\n\nTaking a strong hold... (Take it sniper, take out flame thrower barrel) enter and beat more people up... Every single base is the same to take out. Nothing new in any!\n\nYou can only carry ONE jerry can (Fuel can) in the car at one time, no matter if you find more, they are wasted. You can only carry one supply of water on you at a time, you cannot even store any in the vehicle!\nWhich is a very stupid thing to do when the game is meant to be a post apocalyptic world.\n(These are things that annoyed me and made me bored)\nThere is also a lot of this fuel around, even though your car barely uses that many... You can find near enough every point a Jerry can to fill up the car, but barely using that much fuel you do not need it, you cannot store it so you just waste it. Pointless!\n\nThere is also no coop or no multiplayer.. LITERALLY!!! So people may say, "Yeah but it's a wasteland and you are the last man alive" and too which I reply "So who are the other people you meet and greet in the game?" There ARE normal people in the game that are not physco and this game would benefit so much more having a team behind you, making a stronghold together, increasing the odds of forming your own alliance, but no!\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes, but only just and I really mean only just... 51% so 49% no, because it does offer some good gameplay for a few hours but then it becomes the same thing around, scavange, talk, fix, scavenge, talk, fix and that too me is the reason plus above no coop I stopped playing the game. So it only, and I mean ONLY just gets a recommend from me!","September 5, 2015","true","2.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

The enemies dont increase in difficulty at all while max just becomes unstoppable within the first few hours, you can max out all maxs skills before even completing 30% of the game making the griffa tokens a pointless edition espically when they just hand them out for no reason half the time. The storyline is weak but still followable. The side quests and loot locations are repetitive and become boring after the first large territorial state is cleared fully. Minefields are just a waste of time offering no real loot value while taking the longest time to get to since you cant quick travel with the dog. Cars are quite cool as is the combat with the vehicles while the "Races" are more just you trying to reach a certain location while a bunch of slow weak cars try to ram you off the road to stop you reaching your destination, all you need to do is use one nitrus boost and you can outrun them for the entire race. Combat is basically just punching someone and pressing block button when it notifys you someone is about to hit you, you also have a shot gun with limited ammo. The fighting is redicoulously easy and i would be suprised if you ever die in combat during the entire game.\n\nPros:\nGood graphics\nFun cars/ car combat\n40+ hours gameplay with all content included in one price\n\nCons:\nRepetitve\nNo Challenge\nNo skill or tatic required\nWeak Storyline\nLots of cutscenes\nLots of pressing activation buttons during battles\nLots of waiting and holding E to open things and interact with objects\nBoring race tracks\nBoring Bland Map\nRepetive Locations\nUniteresting Spoon Fed Collectibles\nRepetitive\nRepetitive\nRepetitive\nRepetitive\nRepetitive\n\nbut i did spend over 40 hours playing it so it wasnt the worst game just not as good as other games avaiable at the moment for cheaper.","May 9","false","43.7"," 26 of 47 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","26","47","0","0"

I play a lot of Counterstrike and I think that this is the perfect game to break up sessions of annoying ♥♥♥ matchmaking. The game overall is pretty good, although it feels grindy here and there when you're out trailing for scrap out in the wastelands it still has a lot to bring to the table.

The environments, the post-apocalyptic settings are amazing. The gameplay is solid and keeps you on your toes cause it can go very bad quickly if you're not fast enough.  I never had such a blast to just ride my car in a sandbox game. The amount of destruction I left behind me makes me smile all the time. The story could be better, that's true, but for me, the atmosphere makes up for it and I DO want to stay in the game for hours.\n\nI'm really not a completionist in games, far from it, but Mad Max makes me want to do everything and it's a sign of an exceptionnal game. I had less fun to complete GTA 5 and I thought it was really good. The game is not more repetitive than other sandbox games but it sure is a lot more interesting to do the side stuff, than let's say, Assassin's Creed XYZ. The car is amazing to use for destruction.\n\nAnd for those interested in the hardware side of MM. I'm running it flawlessly on a i5 4670k and a Radeon 7970 ROG Matrix Platinum.

The bosses are laughably repetetive and easy and because car combat is always the same you are more likely to just be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off than actually feel beaten\n-Story did not really seem interesting(I have to point out that I don't care about story in any game but this one seemed very generic)\n-There was no story mission that took longer than ~15 min. which makes them seem unimportant\n\nNow let me get to a point:\nIt is a good open world game\nIt is a mediocre car combat game but one of a kind\n\nIt has a lot of weaknesses mostly that it's repetetive. You can easiely compare this to Metal Gear Solid V. MGSV has almost always the same objective but offers many different approaches. Mad Max offers to slaughter everyone and everything either by blowing them up or beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of them which makes somewhat boring.\n\nAs I have stated I played 20.8h . If my playtime in this game grows by more than 5 hours I probably changed my mind but if not than I tell you this: After 20 hours I am done with the game. I unlocked pretty much everything and don't see a point in upgrading anything else since there is no challenge whatsoever in it anymore. Other than with Shadow of Mordor for example where it took me 24 hours to get to ~90% completion I am not really satisfied with the time I spent.\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes!\nIs it worth 50€/$ ? Not at all.\nI got it for 19€ and I think it is worth it but I would not recommend you buying it at 50€ for such a simple and repetetive game.\n\nFinal Rating: Reluctant 7/10\n\nFeel free to ask questions in the comment section if you have any and feel free to discuss certain points with my if your opionion differs.\n\nFinal Note: What mostly pisses me off is that it was said that ammo would be rare but since it is not fights get even easier and you mostly use ammo because you just want to get over with fights faster. I suppose they did it because fighting would end up in constantly bashing the same buttons and while driving you would have to constantly ram the opponent which is annoying and boring.","September 24, 2015","true","21.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Max himself is supposed to be this broken man who has given up on trust and others, which ties into his character. I found out that this made him more of a mundane character over an interesting one. He only begins to show interesting desire at the end of the game. The story kept me mildly interested most of the time.\n\nThe gameplay is very fun. I was hesitant to get this game after hearing that it is repetitive, but I found that I experienced none of that. The combat is extremely satisfying in the Arkham style that so many games are copying these days, and the open world aspects are done well. The customizing of the Magnum Opus is fantastic, and I was always excited to get it upgraded further. The bosses were very dissapointing, with really only a few types of bosses reskinned over and over.\n\nThis game is definitely worth the buy, but I found the main story was a bit shorter than I would have liked. If you don't only do story missions and actually take the time to complete the open world aspects, it works.","September 24, 2015","true","41.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The gameplay is, basically, Assassin's Creed / Batman Arkham Asylum: parry, hit hit hit, evade; go to a very high place (balloons in Mad Max) to reveal maps and unlock fast travel; collectibles everywhere and so on. As you play the story missions or unlock... unlockables you get to upgrade and customize your car, your gear and your skills.\n\nThe game is, to me, a lot like the new movie: something that you lean back and enjoy for the action, the "Mad Maxy" vehicles, the road fights and the craziness of the post-apocalyptic world. There's something special about impaling a guy with a harpoon fired from the back of your car, pulling him through his windshield and then dragging him across the desert. The game is as violent as the movie, perhaps even more. It's all about VROOM VROOM VROOM! BARK! BARK! CRASH! BOOM! POW! PEW! PEW! VROOM VROOM VROOM! Does it get repetitive? Absolutely, but if you're enjoying it, who cares? Bugs, I haven't encountered any after 9 hours of gameplay. The game's physics are a bit crazy, little things will sometimes send your car flying. The environment, character and vehicle graphics are all pretty good.","September 2, 2015","true","31.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Its been a long time since i have seen a so perfectly fine optimized game. I run an i7 4770k @ 4,5 Ghz CPU and a Nvidia Gforce 670 GTX and the game runs on ultra settings like a charm on a very very stable 60 fps. I only had minor camera bugs, like the camera trying as hard as it can to focus on something your pulling after you with the harpoon, but thats more a programming thing than a grapical bug.\n\n9,5/10\n\nStory:\n\nthe story needs some time to get going and as im at like 20% of the game ( yes i like exploring) i havent seen much of it- however the game takes its time to introduce you into the characters, story and wasteland as much as it rushes you into the customisation and missionobjectives- overall that makes a good balance to me as the objectives are fast paced and short, rough fun but the story promises to take a deeper breath and contrasts well with the overall pace.\nHowever the story builds up more with the questions that are not asked rather than with those asked- the game gives plenty of hints if you are willing to observe characters and the world as to what happened, why people are the way they are and how everything went to ♥♥♥♥- the brainchild you are producing while driving through endless dunes, seeing oiltankers and airplanes alike inbetween dried salty coral reefs and giant chasms is a sight to ponder and behold.\n\n8/10\n\nGameplay:\n\nAs most people already delved into the way the game plays ill just quickly summarize it:\nbatman like hand to hand combat with powerful combos and finishers , but not as deep as one would like to wish... well what do you expect of a wastelander- meaty fistfights and crude mean weapons. The game doesnt do much in that regard but it does everything right that it attempts. the animations are fluid and dont evoke a repetitive sense as the enemies are plenty.\n\nStronghold invasions can be done the mad max style or the mad max style- one way or the other you will make stuff explode, fall down and die- here and there are some sneaky bits if you dont want to bother trying to rip down a fortresses defenses but eventiually things will explode.\n\nExploration is immensely fun, one would think a wasteland is hard to make feel alive but every time i started to get bored with the environment i got something new to look at and behold thrown at me. The game strikes a perfect balance of wasteland and living world to me and you can always spot a lovingly handcrafted wreckage or sightseeing spot around the next corner. (dont look too close tough- sometimes the graphics designers got a little bit lazy with the textures)\n\nThe survival aspect does get a mention but is rather something that adds a little athmospere than anything truly survival-esque -- youll never have to really bother about water, food and gas but its just a nice immersive aspect to take care of these things- i rather eat maggots and the occasional lizard that eating one medpack after the other and never actually drinking ( lookign at you tombrider) It just fits into the game and the developer noticed its a smart move to just immerse you a little bit more\n\nscavenging is a good balance between exploring and reward- sometimes it gets a slight bit frustrating given the low rewards , but youll find story sniplets and nice vantage points ever so often- and overall the game isnt so littered with collectibles that you lose interest in picking them up  at some point *cough far cry cough*\n\nCars:\n\nnow here lies the fun- the customization options are fun and plenty, you actually have noticeable impact on the behaviour and playstyle of your car when you modify it- its an actual second character- Drawing a line to assassins creed black flag here- in Assassins creed the ship felt like a static thing to me that i would just upgrade- the magnum opus however has its characterchange for every addition or substraction you make and that brings a lot of diversity and fun- if you get bored with your heavily armored boulder of a car- how about ripping all those armor plates and bumpers off to create a fast and furious but very squishy dune racer?\nYou can even do this on the fly so you never have to enter a situation unprepared ( even tough i would rather have the garage only accessible in the safe havens- yet i understand that would hinder gameplay a lot, given the constantly changing world and objectives- so i understand the descision to make the garage acceccible at all times)\n\ncar combat is everything michael bay has to offer and it feels like the movies. Its fast, unfogiving and lots of metal will fly through the air.\n\nShiny and Chrome factor 9/10\n\nVerdict:\n\nyou like desert wastelands, survival, cars ,explosions and mutated people ? get the game, its definitely one of the best releases 2015\n\n9/10","September 3, 2015","true","35.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Dinkie Dye ( yes, pronounced Die, not DEE as done in the game ) means 'The Real Thing'  'The Genuine Article'  'Not fake or artificial'  'The Real McCoy'  'The Real Deal'.  You get my drift.  I'm assuming that Chumbucket pronounces it "Dinkie DEE" because he never went to finishing school, and not because Americans have no clue on how to pronounce 'Australian'.

The game is optimized to the max, pun fully intended.  I was a bit concerned about buying the game with the suggested minimum specs.  Witcher 3, Dragon Age 3 and Shadow of Mordor really pushed my Laptop to the limit.  I am running an aging i7-4800MQ 2.7Ghz 16GB RAM, SSD with 3GB Geforce 770M GTX video card.  I am very happy to say that I am running at near everything turned up on high with no noticble framerate drop that I can tell so far with nearly 4 hours logged without any tweaking done.  I am running Windows 10 and I have stuck with the Nvidia Driver version 355.60  and havent updated .82 yet as I haven't had any problems with .60 and don't want to rock the boat.\n\nAs far as the game play goes the fighting is a pretty fair mix of Shadow of Mordor and Rocksteady's Arkham combat styles.  If you have played either game you will be right at home with the ground combat.  Vehicle combat is very fun and you will spend the large portion of your time in the cars.   Chum your sidekick gets annoying as I pretty much figured he would but you eventually tune him out.  The biggest annoyance to me is I keep thinking of him as a big version of Gollum.  Storywise the game isn't anything amazing so far but it has enough Mad Max feel to it to live up to the title.  All in all the game is one of the best games I have played all year.\n\nWith so many games releasing these days with subpar preformance I think if nothing else Avalanche has proven themselves by releasing a game that is very, very well optimized and stable even on a machine well below the specs they have listed.  I for one am very happy with my purchase so far and high recommend.","September 7, 2015","true","7.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'm really enjoying everything about this game so far. If you're a fan of The Road Warrior series and enjoyed any of the recent WB 3rd person action games then this is worth your time. Especially if you can snag one of the 40% off deals floating around as I did. The key to really making this feel like a proper movie tie in is to first watch Fury Road then turn off the in game music and crank up Fury Road's soundtrack.

RUN AWAY!........\n\nAn Aussie Cult Classic remade, amended and updated by...... AMERICANS!  Gaaaaaah.\n\nThere's two strikes, but guess what.... it works!\n\nMad Max the game captures the spirit of the traditional Mad Max movies, and blends them well with the current Fury Road movie as well.\n\nAn easy game to get into, a little 'console' in nature, it's just a fun way to spend an hour or two.  No overt brain power required, just a good bit of escapism.\n\nPros:\nRuns well on moderate systems.\nAccessible and simple to learn.\nAtmospheric.   I feel parched everytime I play!\nGraphics ( esp burning cars ) is VERY well done.   Scenery is excellent on PC.\n\nCons:\nA little repetitive ( but you can streamline and concentrate on the story line )\nGasTown not as imposing as was elluded to in the movies and lore.  Feels underpopulated, protected and generally underwhelming.\n\nKnit Picking Side Notes:\nFor those who do not know or even remember such a thing as Aussie Slang....   Dinkie Dye ( yes, pronounced Die, not DEE as done in the game ) means 'The Real Thing'  'The Genuine Article'  'Not fake or artificial'  'The Real McCoy'  'The Real Deal'.  You get my drift.  I'm assuming that Chumbucket pronounces it "Dinkie DEE" because he never went to finishing school, and not because Americans have no clue on how to pronounce 'Australian'.  I tell myself this because to miss pronounce it otherwise through ignorance would make this a 2/10 game for me, instead of a 7/10.\n\nEnjoy.","September 9, 2015","true","50.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is a solid action game that maybe follows the WB formula a little to cloesly. Anyone whose played one of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment's 'Batman' games or 'Shadows of Mordor' pretty much knows what to expect from the ground combat more or less. While this is in no way a bad thing 'Mad Max' was also developed by Avalanche Studios , whose biggest claim to fame is the 'Just Cause' series, and I would've liked to see a little less WB and a little more Avelanche in the game play. The biggest complaint I see on negative user reviews is the driving, which is a little funky and takes some getting used to; but it's servicable and far from a deal breaker. The 2 cars I've driven so far, Chumbuckets Buggy and the very early Magnum Opus, both handle pretty much the same but aren't quite as good as most games where driving is a big part of the experience. I'm hoping that as I unlock improvements for the Magnum Opus the car will start to become a little more pesponsive because right now the driving is a little sluggish. If not I'd hope that a patch comes out to address this. I will give an extra "thumbs up" to the vehicle combat; it's pretty spot on and so far I have no complaints. I'm barely a few hours into the game and so far I have to say that this game delivers and is about what I was expecting, maybe a little more, but definitely not what I was hoping for.","September 1, 2015","true","60.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I hardly notice any frame drop, it runs at constat 60 fps on maxed settings @ 1080p.\n\nYou wouldn't exepct much from a wasteland in terms of versatality but this game is unbelieveably dynamic. I mean going from town to town, you'd see the environment changing big time. Every town is different than the other in many ways. While playing this game, you'd never feel like you're stuck in same cliched location.\n\nWhat makes this beautiful game even more beautiful is the awesomely implemented, better version of Batman style hand to hand combat with lots of upgrades to keep the game fresh till the very end.\n\nChumbucket's engineered Mangum Opus (Oh saint, the angel cumbustion wants you to drive it) So probably ya'll  know that this game offers great deal of cars combat but on top of that you have this one main car, called The Magnum Opus, It offers soo many different upgrades that even when you finish the game, you still wouldn't be able to have unlocked all the upgrades. You can modify the car in many different ways, whether it be in terms of its appearance or its performance.\n\nStory - I still haven't finished the game, I've been doing side quests mainly because I don't wanna finish it fast but thus far, the story has been progressing nicely and it's quite engaging.\n\nI'd totally recommend this game to everyone.","September 11, 2015","true","22.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

When I first started to see footage from the game it fell off my radar because to be quite honest looked really bad and early previews started coming out backing up these thoughts.  Once the game had arrived though it couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nThis game is such a sight to be hold.  The open world is beautiful to see and drive through, especially when lard sand storms blow in.  Avalanche did an amazing job bringing the world of Mad Max to life and making this world one that I love jumping back into to revisit.\n\nAs Max you are trying to bring to life Chumbuckets Magnum Opus, the best and baddest car ever built.  To do this you need to scavange scrap, find parts, find a body for the car.   With Chumbucket, your trusty mechanic you setout in the post apocalyptic world in search of siad things, trying to bring peace and safety into a world gone bleak.   Throughout your travels you will make allies and friends and also come across deadly enemies to take out and destroy.\n\nCombat takes place in car vs car action as well as hand to hand combat.  The hand to hand combat is so much fun and makes for a great distraction from the massive car wars that take place all over your world.  I think one of the main things I love about the game is that it isn't based off any movie storyline.  Yes his wife and child are gone and he loses his sacred car, but other than that the villians and story going forward is fresh and new.\n\nAfter the fiasco that WB had with Arkham Knight I was a little worried that this would go down the same path but it definietly did not.  It plays beautifully on the PC, even when things are maxed out.  They did a great job with the port and the optimization of the game.\n\nIf you are a Mad Max fan this is a definite buy and ev en if you are not, this game has a lot to offer and never feels like a chore to play or get boring.  There is a lot to do and will take you a fair amount of time to do it.","September 2, 2015","true","13.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you had to just press the hotkey to collect instead of holding it, it might have not been such an annoyance.\nCamera control can be annoying at times, especially when using vehicle weapons.\nCombat on foot is batman style, does not require much skill, just press the parry button in time when someone attacks.\nConclusion / SummaryDo you like free roaming? Like to do a lot of sidequesting, collecting? Like to drive vehicles? Do you like the Mad Max franchise/movies? Then this game is for you. People who are not that much into the previous mentioned topics can still enjoy the game and get enough satisfaction out of it. The story isn't that great, comes down to go to person x to achieve vehicle unlock x etc. I think I'm halfway through the story but I don't think it will change any time soon. That's not to say that it is boring, the prerequisites that you need to complete can be simple or challenging depending on where you are in the game.\n\nExploration is also done very well. You have these Ubisoft-ish points you have to go to, to scout the area around it but even if you don't you can still explore the various sites by driving around. If you do want to use the balloon sites (to scout the area) you have to secure the site, then go in the air with the balloon and manually detect everything in your vicinity with your binoculars. So it's not something passive as just climbing up somewhere and then 'syncronishing' the area. Don't forget to enjoy the view when you're up there! ;)\n\nCombat system could be better but doesn't really offer any real challenge. The only challenge you'll experience is when you face a large group of enemies where you'll have to press the block/parry button a lot of times on the correct moment. That's not to say the combat system on foot is bad, but it's not my favourite.\n\nAll in all this game doesn't offer anything new, but that doesn't mean it ain't good. I'm really enjoying it and can only recommend this. If you like the previous mentioned topics, buy it straight away, if not then wait till the price drops. This game is definately something you're going to be enjoying if you make the purchase for what you deem the right price!","September 22, 2015","true","41.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you had to just press the hotkey to collect instead of holding it, it might have not been such an annoyance.\nCamera control can be annoying at times, especially when using vehicle weapons.\nCombat on foot is batman style, does not require much skill, just press the parry button in time when someone attacks.\nConclusion / SummaryDo you like free roaming? Like to do a lot of sidequesting, collecting? Like to drive vehicles? Do you like the Mad Max franchise/movies? Then this game is for you. People who are not that much into the previous mentioned topics can still enjoy the game and get enough satisfaction out of it. The story isn't that great, comes down to go to person x to achieve vehicle unlock x etc. I think I'm halfway through the story but I don't think it will change any time soon. That's not to say that it is boring, the prerequisites that you need to complete can be simple or challenging depending on where you are in the game.\n\nExploration is also done very well. You have these Ubisoft-ish points you have to go to, to scout the area around it but even if you don't you can still explore the various sites by driving around. If you do want to use the balloon sites (to scout the area) you have to secure the site, then go in the air with the balloon and manually detect everything in your vicinity with your binoculars. So it's not something passive as just climbing up somewhere and then 'syncronishing' the area. Don't forget to enjoy the view when you're up there! ;)\n\nCombat system could be better but doesn't really offer any real challenge. The only challenge you'll experience is when you face a large group of enemies where you'll have to press the block/parry button a lot of times on the correct moment. That's not to say the combat system on foot is bad, but it's not my favourite.\n\nAll in all this game doesn't offer anything new, but that doesn't mean it ain't good. I'm really enjoying it and can only recommend this. If you like the previous mentioned topics, buy it straight away, if not then wait till the price drops. This game is definately something you're going to be enjoying if you make the purchase for what you deem the right price!","September 22, 2015","true","41.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have been watching this game for a long time and of course I pre-ordered it as soon as it was available but I have to admit I was a little worried after Batman: Arkam Knight.  I can honestly say that so far in I am really liking this game.\n\nPort StatusMad Max plays great. The controls work well with the exception in the menu where I was forced to use my controller to log into WB.  Now this may only be an issue because I have a controller plugged in, but it was still an issue all the same and I should not have to unplug a controller to play a game with a keyboard and mouse.\n\nGraphicsThey have done an awesome job optimizing this game.  I did have some lighting issues with flickering but after downloading the new Nvidia driver 355.82 it was flicker free.  With Vsync off I am getting well over 200 fps with every setting maxed out.  The graphics are Next Gen and look great.\n\nStoryI really like the story, but then who doesn't like Mad Max. It is the familiar post appopolyptic story where Max has lost everything and revenge.  The open world game with side quests are great.  The environment is easy to immerse yourself in.  I just wish you had choices and consequences.\n\nFurious BugsThe game is bug free for the most part although some people have experienced issues with the map, I have found an entirely different issue.  My bug relates to an earlier quest I completed in the first zone unlocking ammo stations in the last two zones.  Unfortunately my ammo stations are not unlocked and of course there is no way to replay the quest without replaying the game so I am unable to collect an achievement I earned unless I replay the game to do so.  The game has been patched several times but my issue remains.

I already played the game for a good while albeit I still have not\nfinished the main questline. Without further ado then here we go:\n\nStory        This is of course extremely subjective but overall I have enjoyed so far. Although the story and the dialog is not Oscar-worth by any stretch of the imagination, this post apocalyptic mad world is presented in a very direct and simple manner.\n\nWhile some could argue however that this is not a positive aspect to it (which wouldn't exactly be wrong since again, this is very subjective), I do find it a little problematic when story writers try to make some that is, or at least should be, simple into something complex in a attempt do add, or make it look like, it has "depth" to it. Most often than not to me such action ends up just making the narrative confusing and in some cases, nonsensical.\n\nYet, despite its simple presentation there is some good and funny creativity here (most noticiably on how this world works and how people make by and live on it). Your faithful ally Chumbucket and his crazy religious beliefs and lines is an (funny) example of it.\n\nThe things only start to frail a little when we enter the voice acting department, some are good and others.. eh. While I certainly don't expect every single line on every single occasion to be delivered as if Laurence Olivier was behind it, there were some moments (and not exactly few) that were bellow the average of what you would expect from it. Most noticeably it happens when you talk to random NPC's around the map that give you intel/scrap/whatever.\n\nPort/Graphics        Not much to say really - it is a very good one on almost all aspects. For more detailed info; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79EL0QDoJrs&ab_channel=TotalBiscuit,TheCynicalBrit.\n\nHowever I did noticed a very small/rare problem. Despite the game running at 60 FPS pretty much always there are times every hour or so where the game freezes for a second and then goes back to 60. The pattern looks to be completely random and I've seen it happen on some people videos/streams a few times and there were others talking about it. If I were to take a very wild guess here, the blame lies on the (already cracked) Denuvo DRM (for more info on why it would be the DRM, google on how this thing works).\n\nI guess they will never learn.\n\nGameplay        This will be a tricky part. But if you want my personal opinion, there is a not so small problem(s) with it.\n\nAnd the problem is that if we remove travel times and focus solely on the action parts THAT ACTUALLY MATTER, be it on a minor or major way inside the game (i.e outpost capture, random quests, main quest, etc), we have 60% on foot combat and 40% car combat. Now, when you also consider that the melee combat is 100% based on the already overused Batman-like system of 2 button presses with the occasional 3rd one.. Well, I guess your experience will depend on how you personally view said combat system.\n\nThe thing is, when we compare to other games that use the very same style like say for example, Shadow of Mordor, we can still conclude that what we have here is a fairly inferior one. While playing SoM there was at least some sort of "variety" to it, be it on the superior character skill customization and combat combos, more weapons with each allowing for different approaches during gameplay, much better weapon customization (runes) where you can build your arsenal in such way that it complements/enhances the way you have built/play with your main character skills, and lets not forget of course all the effin amazing fatality animations we do during combat (If by the way you have a personal problem with Orcs, that game will be your perfect stress reliever).\n\nAlso as a final note here.. Sometimes you will have to face mini-bosses, the so called "Top Dogs". And the interesting thing here is that they all LOOK THE SAME AND FIGHT THE SAME WAY - that is just lazy.\n\nAs for the car part of the game.. There is definitely a certain charm in building the Magnum Opus to your liking, seeing it evolve from the pile of junk you start with it and later on becoming your Symphony No. 9.\n\nI won't say that there's little variety in this department but when you really get down to it, there's also not that much. You get a set amount of parts where some are straight upgrades from the others so you won't find much reason to go back and grab a "lower" one - if we were then to forget the body of the car (which there is a selection for you to choose from) and focus on a max performance-only build, most player cars will pretty much use the very same parts all around and end-up being the "same".\n\nIf you ask me, we definitely need more customization options here, both when it comes to looks and when it comes to performance/gadgets. Also as a side note, you can collect cars on the wasteland and use them, although I never ever felt the desire to do so.\n\nBut what about the big booms? The dirty in-your-face car combat? When you get to the thick of the action it is fun. You have a selection of weapons you can use and most of the time you can target specific parts of your enemies. The explosions and the sound are well made and the debris fly around almost in a poetic manner. There is also a variety of enemies here with each having their own strategies to try to take you down (not that many though mind you, this also should really be expanded).\n\nI feel however that the game really drops the ball in the convoy system and that a great opportunity was lost here, both on the action department and in the metagame aspect.\n\nWhat should be (to me) an intense RACE against the clock to try to stop a cargo from reaching its destination, ends up becoming a very simple hit-n-run-wait-for-repair-and-repeat mission. Convoys drive in circle, on the very same route, 24/7 non-stop despite being under attack or not. What do you do then? Start your run, kill 2-3 cars, fallback (if you leave the leader alone, they wont chase you), repair and catch up or just stand still and wait for them to come back in the very same route.\n\nThis is a Fail on several levels. Convoys should carry a very important cargo (what they carry barely matters), they should go from point A to B as fast as possible (adding to the tension, action and making SKILL play a bigger role) and it would be on your best interest to stop them not only for the loot but because if they do end up completing their run point B would become stronger making then your life on the world more difficult (this is what we call metagame). I really, REALLY wish they upgrade this system down the line.\n\nBugs - Sound parts sometimes cuts or becomes almost muted (mostly the car engine).\n- Sometimes you can hear the sound of other cars that are far away as if they were right by your side.\n- Don't ask me how I did this but once while trying to take off a can of gas guzz from the back of the car I ended up getting stuck on a loop in the animation.\n- On a few occasions ramming that should've cause damage did nothing whatsoever.\n- I heard of a save breaking bug that happens if you do something on a specific mission. Yes I am aware this doesnt help much but you might wanna search the forums for more detail info about it (I did not have problems).\n\nTL:DR        No TL:DR, these things take time to write so go back and read it :D\nOverall though I am having fun with it and I will keep playing, if it is worth picking now or waiting for a sale it is up to you and your income. Thank you for taking the time to read.","September 18, 2015","true","34.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

Unless you're a twitch-monkey who just wants targets, you also may be interested in the plotline, and (so far) explain the point of each phase of the missions you perform.\n\n**The E key is your primary form of interaction; controls are not difficult, and can be remapped easily.\n\n1.) Linear progression as opposed to open world/WoW, where you can literally go anywhere you want, if you can live/get there.  This is in regard to advancing the plot.\n\n2.) You can explore the zone you're in to your heart's content, provided you have the fuel or want to run (and run and run...)\n\n3.) Combat is formulaic, rather than spontaneous, and at early stages you get key-hints to tell you "block" or use other skills.  Blocking nub enemies is only practice; you can just beat the snot out of them without defending.\n\n4.) Weapon use is not yet part of the game, despite possession of a shiv and a shotgun, except for shooting nub vehicles to 1-shot blow them up.  This is on the quest to get your new car.\n\nI'm having fun so far, but tbh, not $60 worth of fun.  I considered refunding the game on the basis of cost alone, but after 4-5 hours of download time, and the realization that I will want to play the game more, I'm gonna stick it out.\n\nAt this very early view of the game, I give a 7/10 review, and expect that evaluation to go UP as I play more.  Review will be updated later on.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n21 hours in; I've owned this game for ~4 days.\n\nMadness.  Great game so far.  So good, in fact, that I've temporarily abandoned the storyline because mugging convoys for scrap is more fun than driving past them (i.e., letting them get away).  There's so many locations in the world, they seem almost endless in this stage of the game, and all of them are either NPC strongholds, lootables, destroyables, or some combination of the three.\n\nThe game remains linear in terms of plotline, but in order to advance it (and enter new terrirtory) you'll want to have some side missions done/locations explored.  Scrap is how you buy up your gear, both personal and vehicular - thus, you need to loot, and kill stuff to loot.\n\nThis brings me to the single down point I find in the game so far, unless I'm just not yet to the point where it changes: you can collect cars you defeat (unless they are destroyed) and bring them back to a stronghold for later use... but if you want to salvage parts from them, you have to destroy them on the road.  Funny how a whole car isn't worth much but the collector value, and a destroyed car is worth ~1/10 (if that) of the value of buying an improvement to your own car.\n\nThe obvioius up side to this hitch is that you have ("GET") to destroy more stuff on the road.\n\nOne thing that stopped me up at first was the enemy insignia in the camps; you destroy the Scabrous Scrotus insignia at these locations to 100% clear them.  Some are hard to find, and of those, some are too high to reach.  Thus, you need a shotgun shell (rare items, at first) or some other tool to destroy them when they're out of reach.  Have a shell on-hand unless you want to come back, but always look for the alternative - a thrown gas can, or an exploding spear, conveniently placed at various places throughout the enemy camps.\n\nCurrent evaluation of the game is now 8.5/10.  Good ambiance, great cutscenes (except the one for putting a gas can into your car... that one is getting annoying), good character actors and rederning, easy controls, well planned plot progression, and fun combat and adventuring, both on foot and in vehicle.\n\nXD ~~Great job, Avalanche!~~ XD","September 1, 2015","true","131.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The car combat is very satisfying and even the somewhat simplistic arkham style ground combat is fun, especially because the game switches the two around constantly. Like other reviewers have noted the game has a lot of "busy" work but I never found it to be any more "grindy" then what you generally see in pretty much every open world game these days.\n\nAlso it needs to be said that the game is absolutely gorgeous. They actually managed to make a mostly desert area look beautiful and interesting. The day and night cycles are also noteworthy. The whole game just looks like a benchmark game, but it's extremely well optimised and fortunately never feels like one.\n\nIt's one of the few games I actually 100%'ed this year and that says a lot about it. I could never put myself to do so in games like say: assassin's creed, and it's mostly just because the combat and the upgrading mechanics for the car are so much fun.\n\nHighly recommended!","October 1, 2015","true","66.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Post-apocalyptic game 8/10 ********\n\nA wasteland game that is heavily influenced by the movie of the year (2015), Mad Max: Fury Road. Though the main story doesnt exceed even the least of my expectations before the game's release but it delivers a vast open world with so many unique places to discover and pillage. Which happens to be the best part of the game.\n\nThe main attraction of this game is the vehicular combat and the car customizing functionality. Learn to drive like a mad man to best your opponents in the desert wasteland and you will be visually rewarded with beautiful explosions and chaos. The combat style flows closely with the Batman: Arkham games ( made by the same developers ) but IMO: they made it much better and more violent like it should be. Experiment with all kinds of weapons you can find during a battle because they will never fail to amuse you. ( My favorite was the Thunderstick ). Setting aside the main quests, this game heavily relies on exploration and side quests. It may seem that the developers spent more time in designing the entire world than focusing on its story that reminds me of some other post-apocalyptic themed games I played before ( Fallout ).\n\nBottom line is, this was an amazing hotseat video game that I could just turn my mind off to and relax.","October 15, 2015","true","92.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

This is the absolutely most gorgeous game I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Not just wonderfully rendered and optimized, but the level of detail is staggering. I sincerely hope the content directors of this game were paid a hefty sum, because they certainly deserve all credit due. From random debris drifting along the dunes, to the licks of burning fuel dripping out of the exhaust, and sandstorms from the depths of Hades. Sand, grime, blood, oil, unholy amounts of rust befitting the utter collapse of civilization.\n\nGameplay itself is quite straightforward and rewarding, yet punishing enough for an enjoyable challenge. Max's personal equipment and fighting skills are easy to level up. The somewhat grind comes in finding parts for your various vehicle outfittings. Though tearing through structures, war boys, and cars with the "Magnum Opus" will sate your urge for downtown road rage to be sure!\n\nYou'll notice Max has an odd gait and brace on his leg. Combine that with the armor and equipment he has straped to him at all time, and the naysayers who complain about the platforming are just silly. Even if not permanent I really appreciate the effort taken to show persistent wounds and bruises as well.\n\nThe storyline is great. Combine dehydration, malnutrition, lack of medicine, constant fear of being raided, with some good old exposure to the elements, and you can understand why most of the people you interact with don't have all their cylinders firing... if you catch my drift there.\n\nThis is a faithful companion to the new Fury Road. The reboot seems to have a vastly more aloof and gritty personality for Max. As well as perhaps giving a nod to the realities of everything going to absolute hell: PTSD, survival of the fittest, empaty not having much signifigance because it's a luxury. This felt less like a game and more as an experience. You have to keep in mind George Miller created this story as a way of sharing what he lived through when treating victims of vehicular carnage while he was an emergency room doctor.\n\nA few points of minor complaint I had:\n-The dog and associated uses for it were nearly useless. Not sure if an afterthought or someone's "pet" project that never got the attention it deserved. Could have really made things interesting like a helpful attack dog, and/or sniffing out supplies. Not even once did mines ever pose a problem for me.\n-No deadly desert critters, or tasty lizards to roast? Missing out on the best parts of Australian outback there mates.\n-No ability to make my own war-boy possee complete with flamethrowing guitars of the metal gods? What gives Avalanche... what gives?\n\n9.8/10\n\nPeople think dog food is the lowest point of survival? I would have loved to see Max suffer through a can of Vegimite instead.

They have few apparent flaws, but they don't really excel in any department either. Those games make it apparent that one important feature is missing from Steam reviews: the thumb pointing to the side.\n\nThe Mad Max movies popularized the post-apocalypse as a setting and left a stylistic imprint along the way. Many of the things you saw in the movies became a staple of post-apocalyptic fiction in general: vast and empty landscapes, moral decay, lack of resources and violence in all shapes or forms. Mad Max also gave the characters populating such an environment a distinctive look: Wasteland dwellers didn't just dress in torn up jeans or ripped shirts, they rather wore something between football gear, hardware store and BDSM fetish - something many fictional works borrowed from. In a way, games like Fallout, Rage or Borderlands are Mad Max games in spirit. Finally, the OG gets his own (current-gen) game and the result can be described as a big and resounding "eh".\n\nEven if you never laid hands on Mad Max before, chances are you already played it. The game incorporates two of the most overused popular features of this generation: open world and Arkham Asylum style two-button combat. Since this is Mad Max, vehicular combat also plays a big role in this game. In fact, your ultimate goal is to acquire enough currency to turn Max's car into a spike-ridden monstrosity capable of defeating the local warlord. To do so, Max can engage in a multitude of activities, be it racing, attacking enemy convoys or taking down bandit camps. Plus, there are possibly hundreds of locations Max can loot for small rewards.\n\nMad Max is not just any sandbox game - it's THE sandbox game. With all of the genre's pros and cons amplified. To the max.\n\nThe big drawback of those games is that the large quantity of activities goes at the cost of their quality, leaving you with a large selection of missions that get repetitive fast and simply aren't that interesting in the long run. It doesn't help that you need to do them dozens of times.\n\nHere's the thing: The game's mechanics are competent and don't have any apparent flaws apart from the lack of depth. After a while, you will develop a nice and steady flow, taking out one bandit camp after another, even though you don't enjoy yourself as much as you think you should. At some point, you will develop that MMO tunnel vision, eyes set on the next upgrade, which will be enough to keep you going. The mechanics are simple, but don't require any finesse, strategy or skill. As you play, your mind will wander off frequently. Maybe I should go swimming, you will think. You will catch yourself pondering life and its existential tribulations to the sound of exploding cars and cracking bones. Eventually, you will awaken from your trance.\n\nThe only times I stumbled over some honest fun was during the car chases, but even they got tiresome after common enemies received multiple layers of armor and started attacking in groups of three - often when I was in a hurry to get somewhere. Meanwhile, the missions in which you are supposed to attack a convoy are possibly the closest you will get to a breathless chase depicted in Fury Road.\n\nMad Max is by no means a bad game and more of an example of somebody trying excessively hard to play it safe. It's vanilla ice cream. It's Coldplay. It's jeans and t-shirt. Only the visuals manage to impress since the game is nice to look at and runs without any hiccups.\n\nThis may sound like a thoroughly negative review, but it comes down to what you want from the game. If you expect a strong movie tie-in, you will be severely disappointed. However, if you often find yourself with a couple of hours to kill, Mad Max is the game for you. It will keep you busy for hours upon hours.\n\nBusy. Not necessarily entertained.","January 19","true","30.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

I cannot remember the last time I was so violently enthralled with a game from the very get go.  I was not expecting this to fully capture the FEEL of the mad max movies as incredibly well as it has done!  Though I am not very far into it at this point, it has been pure pleasure since the very beginning!\n\nThe visuals are absolutely amazing, and optimization... holy sh*t!  I don't think I have ever seen a game that looks so good and runs so flawlessly!  This is probably one of, if not THE best looking games in my library and it runs on my 3440x1440 ultrawide smooth as silk on ultra settings!\n\nThey did an amazing job giving you a huge wasteland to roam and explore, yet while the area is so vast, so far it has definitely not suffered from the traditional "open world sandbox travel through miles of nothing to get to the patches of content" syndrome.  Or at least it hasn't felt like it.  Maybe that's because the gameplay itself is just so d*mn much fun!  (did I mention how well it captures the feel of the films? :D)\n\nThe "on foot" combat is very very much, the tried and true assassins creed, batman, shadows of mordor formula as many have stated, with the very refreshing alteration of being more brute strength and rage based then graceful cat like ninja.  You're not leaping all over hell and back, doing fancy spin kicks and back flips, it's more the "walk up to someone, grab em by the neck and smash their face into a table" type.  Absolutely LOVE it!\n\nVehicular combat... this is the crème de la crème feature of this game, the grand masterpiece!  OMFG it is so much fun!  It's... well... it's something you really just have to experience for yourself, but... ya... wow!  I have seen a few reviewers complaining about the driving controls, personally I don't see it.  To me the driving has been better than most I have played.  The car has been easier to handle and control for me than most other games of this type.  Granted, I do not play racing games, where the entire effort of the game has gone into the driving / vehicle handling, but I do play most all of the sandbox games that involve guns and cars, and imho this one is better than most as far as vehicle control and driving is concerned.  (or again, maybe it's just because driving in THIS game is so much more fun than the others... I mean... when was the last time you were racing through a debris filled desert mashing it up with other cars and shot the driver with a harpoon and yanked him out of the other vehicle through the window?  Come on... so brutal... I LOVE it!)\n\nThere is so much to go on and on about with this title in the way of comparison with other open world sandbox rpgs, but really... at least for me... there's no need, while all of those things do mashup to equate to the overall completeness and  complexity of the game (and they do so very well so far, and I have not yet found anything lacking in the way of systems or things to do), what it really boils down to for me... is fun factor... this game is SO much fun to play!  Based on what I have seen so far, I could wander aimlessly through the desert for hours just engaging in random encounters and still feel like I was getting my moneys worth on this game.  All technical, feature, and systems talk aside, it is just plain and simple, good old fashion fun!\n\nDef recommend this title to anyone who even remotely likes the Mad Max movies!","December 23, 2015","true","25.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/balaamsass/recommended/234140/","balaamsass","Balaam's ass","http://steamcommunity.com/id/balaamsass/","452 products in account","1+ hours in and I can say the following based on progression through zone 1 - that's the disclaimer for peeps who want to know what $60 will buy at release.\n\n*Watch the cinematics; they're decently rendered and entertaining, at least the first time through.  Unless you're a twitch-monkey who just wants targets, you also may be interested in the plotline, and (so far) explain the point of each phase of the missions you perform.\n\n**The E key is your primary form of interaction; controls are not difficult, and can be remapped easily.\n\n1.) Linear progression as opposed to open world/WoW, where you can literally go anywhere you want, if you can live/get there.  This is in regard to advancing the plot.\n\n2.) You can explore the zone you're in to your heart's content, provided you have the fuel or want to run (and run and run...)\n\n3.) Combat is formulaic, rather than spontaneous, and at early stages you get key-hints to tell you "block" or use other skills.  Blocking nub enemies is only practice; you can just beat the snot out of them without defending.\n\n4.) Weapon use is not yet part of the game, despite possession of a shiv and a shotgun, except for shooting nub vehicles to 1-shot blow them up.  This is on the quest to get your new car.\n\nI'm having fun so far, but tbh, not $60 worth of fun.  I considered refunding the game on the basis of cost alone, but after 4-5 hours of download time, and the realization that I will want to play the game more, I'm gonna stick it out.\n\nAt this very early view of the game, I give a 7/10 review, and expect that evaluation to go UP as I play more.  Review will be updated later on.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n21 hours in; I've owned this game for ~4 days.\n\nMadness.  Great game so far.  So good, in fact, that I've temporarily abandoned the storyline because mugging convoys for scrap is more fun than driving past them (i.e., letting them get away).  There's so many locations in the world, they seem almost endless in this stage of the game, and all of them are either NPC strongholds, lootables, destroyables, or some combination of the three.\n\nThe game remains linear in terms of plotline, but in order to advance it (and enter new terrirtory) you'll want to have some side missions done/locations explored.  Scrap is how you buy up your gear, both personal and vehicular - thus, you need to loot, and kill stuff to loot.\n\nThis brings me to the single down point I find in the game so far, unless I'm just not yet to the point where it changes: you can collect cars you defeat (unless they are destroyed) and bring them back to a stronghold for later use... but if you want to salvage parts from them, you have to destroy them on the road.  Funny how a whole car isn't worth much but the collector value, and a destroyed car is worth ~1/10 (if that) of the value of buying an improvement to your own car.\n\nThe obvioius up side to this hitch is that you have ("GET") to destroy more stuff on the road.\n\nOne thing that stopped me up at first was the enemy insignia in the camps; you destroy the Scabrous Scrotus insignia at these locations to 100% clear them.  Some are hard to find, and of those, some are too high to reach.  Thus, you need a shotgun shell (rare items, at first) or some other tool to destroy them when they're out of reach.  Have a shell on-hand unless you want to come back, but always look for the alternative - a thrown gas can, or an exploding spear, conveniently placed at various places throughout the enemy camps.\n\nCurrent evaluation of the game is now 8.5/10.  Good ambiance, great cutscenes (except the one for putting a gas can into your car... that one is getting annoying), good character actors and rederning, easy controls, well planned plot progression, and fun combat and adventuring, both on foot and in vehicle.\n\nXD ~~Great job, Avalanche!~~ XD","September 1, 2015","true","131.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Absolutely beautiful.\n\nSo when I first opened the game, I had never heard of the movies. I admit, I might have been living inside the barrel for a while, but I played the game 20 hours until I watched "Mad Max: Fury Road". And guess what? I definitely enjoyed it.\n\nMad Max is a game about a man who has lost everything, in the beginning his car, and then starts his hunt to get the car back only to meet Chumbucket, a hunchback who will build him a new car called "The Opus Magnum". So in a nutshell, Mad Max is a game about a man who looses his car, meets a hunchback that builds him a new car and now is searching for a V8 motor for the "Magnum Opus" in a desert wasteland.\n\nAs I said, the game itself is open-world, post-apocalyptic and on times challenging: not too hard, it's repeating a lot of tasks. There's no hard ending due to repeating tasks. Surely, it's not like some other games, but it's still great. It's filled with places to loot to with enemy camps and easter eggs which are easy to miss if you haven't watched the movies or played other games from this studio. I mean, there's a lot of references are straight to the movies, like eating the "Dinki Di" food to restore health. So I'd recommend watching the movie(s) and then play the game.\n\nI currently play with a EVGA GTX 980 Superclocked (4GB) and I minor problems with the game. Some minor crashes in certain locations, but overall the FPS was solid 60. Definitely a huge plus. Even in the most intensive sandstorms the FPS stayed as a solid 60 with no drops at all. The game is amazingly good optimized, looks pretty, even runs pretty.\n\nIf you don't like to drive from one location to another or hates driving, the game isn't for you.\n\nOtherwise, I truly recommend the game. Great game and it even has replay potential, 10/10.","March 3","true","55.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Loving every minute of it.\n\nMy belated game of the year for 2015. Gameplay's simple but extremely satisfying, combined with amazing post-apocalyptic atmosphere. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!\n\nOne of the only games I've ever played that makes me want to 100% it. Despite the fact that this game has the "Ubisoftian" style of open world design, it's not like Assassin's Creed or Batman, where the world is filled with absolutely mind-numbingly boring activities. You drive around and visit decrepit locations, loot and collect scraps while sightseeing, beat up people with a satisfying Batman-like combat, maintain and upgrade your vehicle, run errands for Warlords and learn more and more about both Max and how the world turned into a wasteland. Everything is fluid, you go from one simple and satisfying activity to another. Not like AC or Batman where half the activities are clunky, time consuming and boring. Need scrap to upgrade car, drive around, find a camp, beat people up, reduce enemy presence in the region, take their scrap, upgrade car, need more scrap to upgrade further, rinse, repeat. Perfect and simple.\n\nOne single unsatisfying thing exists in the game, which is disarming minefields. Gigantic speed-bump. Very annoying. But not at all mandatory, it just triggers my OCD if I leave them undone.\n\nNobody hates the Ubisoftian design more than me. Seriously, I didn't even like Assassin's Creed 4. But Mad Max shown me that it can be done well.\nAnd I have to re-state how amazingly well done the atmosphere is. I will keep the studio behind this game on my radar, because it takes true talent to take the idea of a "desert" and flesh it out into such a complete, detailed world. It's actually way better than the movie (Fury Road) in that aspect. Fury Road was just a desert. In this game, you go through dried out seabeds, an uncovered volcano, abandoned highways, decrepit buildings, an airport buried in sand... It's beautiful.\n\nThere's a host of cons, which would absolutely destroy a lesser game, but the fact that I don't care about them here is a testament to how good this game's core gameplay is.\n\n\nPros:\n-A simplistic, Ubisoftian game design actually being executed well for once.\n-Near-perfect PC port. The only thing I can nitpick is that Anti-Aliasing is just a simple "Yes" or "No", despite there being many other highly customizable graphical settings.\n-Long, if you want to do everything.\n-Photo Mode allows you to pause the game and take pictures while noclipping. There's also a selection of post-processing you can apply before taking the picture.\n-Highly detailed atmosphere and game world.\n-Good voice acting.\n-Very satisfying action. Vehicular combat is powerful and explosive. Melee combat feel powerful and requires you to pay just enough attention to make it interesting. It plays just like Batman, but the amount of handholding is taken down by a strong notch, making you have to pay attention to your positioning and timing. The sound design also makes your hits feel much more satisfying than in the Batman games.\n-Style. Not sure what else to call it. There's a bunch of little things that make me feel good. Like the way Max behaves while interacting with the environment, being able to use the Harpoon for more things than you'd expect, the chest-mounted flashlight actually having it's uses, etc. etc.\n\nCons:\n-The cars cannot be flipped. I can think of several good reasons why they made this decision, that go beyond the simple idea of "handholding", but overall it really takes away from the game. There's no risk to making bad jumps or driving through uneven terrain. In the end they should have found a way to make it work. It looks goofy, too.\n-There's no enemy variety, which holds a really big threat to the game's replay value, but not a fatal issue. Not to me, anyways. Even the bosses are all the same.\n-The game is overall on the easy side, so long as you pay attention.\n-The gotdamned minefields are so stupid, I swear to god. Play the game to see what I mean. It can't be put into words. A huge break in the action.\n-Max has a shotgun and there's enemy Snipers littered all over the world, yet gunplay is not actually a part of the game. Nobody else carries any fire arms. It would have been hard to implement firefights into the game, but I hope they consider it, if there's a sequel.\n-The soundscaping could have used some more work. The NPC that rides along with you constantly calls out events that aren't actually happening. "THERE IT IS! THE MIGHTY DUSTER!" he tells us, warning us of a mini-tornado that is nowhere to be seen. "YONDER! A WAR PARTY!" but not a single enemy unit anywhere.\n-The races are really dumb. Might have been an unfinished aspect of the gameplay that they didn't have time to flesh out. Or maybe it's an unwritten law of the Ubisoftian game design that your open world game needs some side-activities that nobody in their right mind would ever consider entertaining. Still, they're somewhat engaging at least and fast paced enough to not be a huge negative. Not to mention optional.","March 31","true","56.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Some people have mentioned their map disappears, but it should be fixed after Patch 4.

BUT I was really looking forward to this game and didn't really want to buy it on a console so I figured "if it looks like garbage I'll just return it."\n\nSo I installed it and ran it for the first time, saw the opening cinimatic and it looked amazing. I figured "must just be the cinimatics being prerendered or something." So it ended and the game started and it looked amazing, I checked my settings and everything was preset at Ultra!!! I am blown away with the optimization of this port. I am consistantly at 60FPS and running at 1440P with Ultra settings on a card this old is just awesome!\n\nI only have a little bit of time in the game so I don't want to say much else about it yet other than so far the game is very fun and that the hand to hand sounds absolutely brutal (as it should). In fact, the sound in general is very nice so far.\n\nI will update this review after I am further along and can speak more on the gameplay aspects.","September 1, 2015","true","17.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Granted, I bought a Steam key from a friend pretty cheap, so I am judging the game based on spending $25 for it, not $60.\n\nPros:\n*Open world filled with things to do and some really cool locations to explore.\n*Cool storyline.\n*Awesome driving with upgrades that really change the feel of your cars.\n*Optimized for PC - my PC is decent but not great and it runs it perfectly on ultra-high settings.\n*Combat is very Batman: Arkham City, especially once you unlock the cool maneuvers.\n*Length: I have 40 hours in, and I am still only at 50% completion.\n*The world conversations react to things you have done, so you see your legend grow.\n*Never felt like it was a grind for scrap, unlike some negative reviews. Decent pace for upgrading both Max, the strongholds, and vehicles.\n*YOU GET TO BE SHINY AND CHROME! WITNESS ME!\n\nCons:\n*Only being able to climb/jump in specific areas means that you will get stuck sometimes. Like, if you fall off a walkway, you may find yourself stuck and unable to climb the ONE FOOT rocks hemming you in.\n*Easy. Like, the game is rather  too easy, especially if you are  like me and ignore storyline to do all the side quests and scavenging. By the time you do the storyline, you're walking through boss fights. I usually only die from stupid mistakes, like falling off cliffs or blowing myself up.\n*The bosses that rule the strongholds are all the same, just with different amounts of health. I feel like this was a cop-out. "AAAAAAAH.... MEDIOCRE!"\n\nAll in all, I am having a BLAST playing this game and recommend it heartily. 9/10 at this price, 7/10 at full price.\n","September 12, 2015","true","90.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Although it has 96% on steam so you probably will anyway...\n\nLooks great, and runs amazingly well, I usually stay above 70fps on my laptop with ultra settings\n\nI feel inclined to leave this review 'cause I've seen a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reviews from 'game critics' on those sites giving it a 6/10 and whatnot, which is a load of rubbish, I feel like they either don't 'get' mad max, or have been payed by Konami to give mediocre reviews to try and get people to buy MGS5 instead... I would not be surprised\n\nI wouldn't call it a perfect 10, there a bunch of things that could be better, for instance pretty much the only few things you can loot is scrap metal and ammo (so far). You'd think in a wasteland survival game, finding new items/weapons/clothing would be a pretty big deal, but not in this game (so far anyway, I have only played a few hours and I could be totally wrong..). Which is a shame.\n\nEverything else is pretty good in my opinion, nice combat system, driving mechanics are alright, and the setting is amazing, they captured the mad max environment perfectly. Plus the story has been good so far.\n\nAll I want you to take from this review is not to trust 'professional' game critics, 'cause they're usually full of ♥♥♥♥.","September 3, 2015","true","16.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aricvomit/recommended/234140/","aricvomit","aricvomit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aricvomit/","785 products in account","Well where to start. There are a lot of really great things about Mad Max and thing's that reveal themselves over time to the displeasure of the gamer.\nI'll detail some pro's and con's seeing that there isnt alot of usefull information out there\nabout this game and a lack of any official forum that ive seen. *I've looked, nothing but links to twitter and facebook on the main site*\n\nCon's\n\n1. Complete lack of any moral decision making outside of killing random wastelanders that want water or are trying to share scrap with you and no effect on the overall story whatsoever, there arent any repercussions to killing the random wasteland either. This means you wont have the choice to do the right thing or the wrong thing, just whatever the designers wanted you to do for the story they wrote.\n\n2. Lack of multiplayer in a game that would have benefitted it greatly.\n\n3. Minimal HUD options can take you out of the world fairly easily.\n\n4. Wonky camera control while first person driving, its especially irritating in combat.\n\n5. Nothing to do after completion of game besides minor random car battles that are overly easy, I never felt like I was fighting for my life and they tend to run away most of the time near the end of the game.\n\n6. Every "Top Dog" boss is essentially the same boss battle over and over and most of the times with a palette swap, very lazy considering the universe mad max is set in is very diverse with their wastelanders generally.\n\n7. Car customization isnt so much car customization as it is just upgrading stuff, your stuck with the same batch of weapons even though you see other cars with neat stuff and can use them allthough they are never as effective as the magnum opus since you can only use your shotgun do to the lack of Chum not being available on any ride except for the opus. There's no way for you to truly make the car your own either, your limited to about 6 paint jobs that are used on all the cars in game pretty much, no personal decal deisnger so your stuck with the base in game decals which are passable if you find one you like and about 6 or so car bodies most of which look like crappy sports cars with the exception of the death rattle which resemble's nux's car from Fury Road.\n\n8.Wasteland base upgrades are a neat concept but ultimately outside of refilling your ammo ,gas,health, and water *making the survival aspect of the game nil and void* they don't do anything aside from maybe open a back area where you can't do anything or perhaps add some cloth drapes to an overhang. That and I dont see myself co-operating with people that willing participate in a slave trade.\n\n9. Max's movement at times since clunky and underdeveloped especially when you realize there is a jump button and its ♥♥♥♥ poor and is mostly there so you can hopefully hop out of whatever broken mess of ♥♥♥♥ you landed in. I've had to restart the game due to being stuck at least 10 times.\n\n10. No contextual cover and movement meaning that there is no cover button in a world filled with cover. No ducking behind your car or crocuhing or sneaking. Max is more or less a wrecking ball, The opus can handle almost entire camps without having to actually do much other than torch people as you lead them to your car.\n\n11. Severe lack of character development and meaningfull interaction. In a game where the main character is known for being a man of few words you'd think the extraneous characters would recieve mass amounts of attention but after realizing the game was being made with an american voice actor before fans flipped out and they did the right thing hiring an australian I realized they didnt have a good grasp of the source material and what drives these characters.\n\n12. Lack of ranged weapon's, Okay this is something I kind of understand, in an apocalypse theres not going to be a ton of weapons floating around with normal people being ditched due to the lack of ammo. Well in the setting they used the bullet farm exists and not only that but you help a guy find sulfur and saltpeter to make black powder. So why is there a complete lack of any actual firearm outside of max's shotgun and car usuable only sniper rifle, not even a pistol is to be seen anywhere.\n\n13. The Max menu for character customization is also just an upgrade menu with minimal choices for max's look and gear. The facial options you can take for max are things like max with beard, max with beard and bandanna, No clean shaven max's of yesteryear for the fans.  Your relegated to ending up looking lika a commando if you want to use the better gear. The knuckle dusters you make and the armor doesnt feel like anything max would have ever used. your shotgun upgrades read as such * max add's a barrel to the shotgun* add's a barrel? how? with what? where? just scrap metal? This game would have benefitted from an actual equipment system instead of just assuming you have these things like plyers and for some mystery reason the only thing you ever have to buy is a crowbar which is a completely pointless mechanic to open some doors and box's considering how cheap it is it can be bought at the beginning of the game making the doors and chests just irritating.\n\n14. Car combat is ultra repetitive and barely entertaining after awhile, using the harpoon gun to destroy pretty much everything gets boring.\n\nPros.\n\n1. The game is beatiful if you have the power to run it maxed\n\n2. Hand to hand combat feels brutal.\n\n3. Fun till completion of the main storyline.\n\n4. A good first try at a Mad Max game in over 20 years. Hopefully one they expand on and get right next time.\n\n5. Cruising around in crazy storms is fun but ultimately you end up sitting in the same spot for 5 mins if your on a mission or doing something where you cant be destroyed.","September 6, 2015","true","51.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Its a wasteland), car chasing, scavenging (yep, maggots are back on the menu boys), car upgrading and brutal fighting (batman fighting gameplay) this game is for you. Honestly, the way car reacts on the sand, the sound of the engines, everything is wonderful. The way the scenery changes inside a sandstorm, is something that you have never encountered before. In general what do you do in the game now (in case you wonder)\n\n1) you scavenge small camps and abandoned vehicles like ships (i guess there was a sea over there) and you also find relics of another time that reminds you how it was once, and they really add to the feeling\n2)Destroy larger camps with enemies.\n3)Destroy big camps where you have to beat the local boss of the area\n4)participate in death races (while in open world, you can steal other cars in order to use them in these races)\n5)Help helpless people by giving them water, in exchange for information\n6) as you cross the wasteland, random gangs will attack you, or an enemy convoy will pass, that you could attack and destroy in order to gain materials and  parts.\n7) Game has soft borders. Means that there isn't any invinsible wall that will tell you "its over". Want to drive into nothingness? Go ahead. More wasteland for you. You might find something useful, or you can die there. And yes, you can find something useful outside of the map. Well done Avalanche!\n8)I almost forgot. Enemies in cars are not stupid. If they see they loose, they will run away. Its surviving afterl all is it not?\n\nWant to know the best part? I play this game for 7 hours and i haven't even unlock the half of the map. I am just inside a tiny part of it.\n\nDo you like the concept of Mad Max? Buy it.","September 3, 2015","true","34.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's very well optimized, it looks gorgeous and the gameplay feels good and works well. The story is not bad but it's not great either. It's pretty generic and is made up of the most common themes of RPGs.\n\nThe combat feels satisfying but is most of the time not a big challenge as your enemies will almost always attack one at a time which can easily be dealt with by parrying. If there are multiple types of enemies performing different types of attacks in can get quite tough at times.\nThe driving in this game is very good. The sound of the different types of engines are great, the handling feels realistic while still being arcadey enough to be fun and challanging at the same time and the vehicular combat works well.\nMad Max looks really good. Not particularly in terms of texture quality but some of the effects are really stunning especially the explosions. The atmosphere of the whole post-apocalyptic wasteland is also very believable and authentic. There are lots of incredibly detailed areas to be explored.","September 5, 2015","true","44.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/preteenmeme/recommended/234140/","preteenmeme","bambles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/preteenmeme/","452 products in account","This game blew me away. The story, the characters, the environments, the customisation all on point. For a movie-game adaptation this is the best I've experienced so far. I haven't seen any Mad Max films but I picked this game up from {LINK REMOVED}♥♥♥.com for $17 AUD(roughly $12 USD) and blasted through it. I pretty much played it non-stop for 60+ hours over the past 4 or 5 days and I've never enjoyed wasting my spare time on a video game more than this beside MGS V: TTP(Which I no-life'd for 120 hours over 3 weeks).\n\nPoints of reference:\nMagnum Opus - Car\nWar Boys - Enemies\nScrotus - Main antagonist\nChumbucket(Chum) - Companion\n\n\nOverview\n\nYou are left for dead by Scrotus and he's has taken your Interceptor. Max is on a quest to rebuild a car capable of crossing The Plains of Silence.\n\nAt the beginning of the game you are buddied with a dog which I'll go over more later, and hunchback called Chumbucket which I'll also go over later. Max is on a quest to rebuild a car capable of crossing The Plains of Silence. Throughout the game Max and Chum build a new car; The Magnum Opus and upgrade it for attack, defense and speed. The game is set in 5 regions, 4 of which have strongholds which can be upgraded and used as fast travel points. The 4 regions with strongholds have a threat level and by doing an assortment of activities like taking over enemy strongholds, destroying territory markers and clearing minefields you will lower the threat level thus lowering the War Boy presence (The dog is used to find the land mines in the minefields). The strongholds each have a leader who gives you side missions. You'll also be able to upgrade Max with new combat abilities, attire and even hairstyles. The Magnum Opus can be upgraded with 5 different body types and various armaments and defenses like flame throwers, seeking rockets and a harpoon launcher. Of course with this game heavily revolving around Max's car, there are racing activities to do across the map called Death Runs. The Death Runs have a variety of different types of races such as normal races, timebomb races Chumbucket is with you throughout the entire game and stays in the car. His main purpose is to repair the car and initiate conversation with Max so driving around doesn't seem empty. He's a great character and fits well into the story.\n\nCombat System\n\nTo be honest I didn't know what to expect from this game. Warner Bros. has reused the combat systems from the Batman Arkham games and Shadow of Mordor, games which I both enjoyed heavily(besides SoM which I haven't started yet). I think the combat system works really well for a game like Mad Max but at times it just felt like a big chore having to constantly press X(LMB) to attatck and Y(RMB) to counter all the time. Around camps and loot locations where you'll fight War Boys, there are often temporary weapon pick ups that break after a few hits or will drop when you enter a vehicle. I find using a game pad more comfortable for a games like this, especially since the majority of gameplay is made up of CQC and driving.\n\nConclusion\n\nNow I'm not a long-time Mad Max film guy but I have been meaning to go watch Mad Max: Fury Road but I hadn't had time when the movie was in cinemas. I think the narrative is well written and kept me interested throughout the game. I became distracted from the main story for a while, grinding loot locations and collecting scrap metal  as scrap metal which is the games currency. The customisation of Max and the Magnum Opus was very diverse, as well as the enemies and enemy vehicles. Characters were well voiced and unique as well a balanced level of Australian and American accents. Overall I'd rate this game a 9.5 out of 10 and woould definitely recommend it to anyone, Mad Max fan or no.","January 14","true","66.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is really well done and resembles the same atmosphere felt in the film.\n\nThe characters are all fantastic and the voice acting is really one of the best I've ever seen in a video game.\n\nPros:\n1. Probably the most well optimised game I've played ever.\n2. Excellent setting, there's lots of post-apocalyptic games but none that focus on cars and car modifcations to the extent that Mad Max does.\n3. Upgrade system is truly wide an deep. Not only do you have different tiers of unlocks for everything on your car but also for Max himself. There are also some hidden unlocks provided after completion of the story that were a very nice touch.\n4. Combat system is basic but very satisfying with the upgrades you can give Max to give him more of an edge while fighting.\n5. Open world do as you like. You can in theory do a bunch of challenges that gets Max to highest rank before completing the majority of the story and stronghold missions. This leaves you with a very easy path to finishing the game though.\n\nCons:\n1. The game can get a little repetitive with scavenging from camps, finishing top dogs, oil camps and stank gum but these things are ofset by the long term rewards you get for completing the areas.\n2. Stronghold missions tended to be a lot less fun and interesting than the story missions. Sometimes story missions unlock upgrades where you already have the next tier of upgrade.\n3. Once you finish the game if you're still trying to finish up the upgrades to your V8 (final cost for all the V8s is well into > 10000 scrap) scrap tends to be harder to comeby in larger amounts. I also found that mobile scrap transports are very rare in the same limiting your ability to find them on the roads.\n\nAll in all I loved Mad Max from start to finish. It doesn't have any annoying second launcher or DRM, you have the option to get WBPlay (ie its not forced down your throat) and overall is a well rounded game.","January 16","true","56.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When I checked the in-game settings, I was happy to see that the default High setting was in use, but - even more astoundingly - it was also running at 2560 x 1600!\n\nI've noticed a couple of bugs in the sound; Sometimes you get back into your car and race away, but the car noises are muted. They're there, but only at 10% volume. They come back eventually; Comments on missions play randomly even after the mission is complete; but overall, the sound is pretty great. The music moves with the action, without dominating. The car sounds are nicely done, with lots of variance for the different machinery. The voice acting for the main characters is well done, with ability seeming to coincide with the level of the characters' importance.\n\nThe playability is slightly marred by two things: The camera, and the vehicle controls. The camera is controlled with the right thumb stick, but you also need to use your thumb for fighting moves. I've had a couple of bad experiences where I've been backed into a wall and the viewpoint hasn't allowed me to see what is going on. It's cost me a few crucial hits at times. The car controls share a bit of the camera grief too at times, although only at low speeds, but my main frustration is with the steering. It takes forever to re-center, let alone swinging to opposite lock to catch a slide. If you let go of a steering wheel irl, it will (read: should) automatically rotate to the direction of the car's travel, and quickly - it may, in fact, over-rotate, which is where over-correction and spins happen, but that is for another type of game engine. Max seems to work the steering at the same geologic time-scale whether moving at 10 or 210kph. Maybe that's something to do with the car's 'handling' stat, I don't know yet. I'm still rolling around in The Jack, so maybe time will tell.\n\nThe rest of the game mechanics work very well, especially the fighting - both on foot and vehicular. I'm really enjoying wading into groups of warboys with the parrying and combo system used in the fist-fights, whilst regularly unlocking new moves and finishing combos as I progress. The vehicular mayhem presents just as many ways to convert cars to scrap, whether you go with the classic ram-them-until-they-become-a-screaming-fiery-mess approach, or a surgical mindset where the use of tools such as the shotgun and harpoon can quickly remove a threat, but leave the car intact if required. Or both. There are a lot of different enemies, and each needs a different approach, so your tactics will need to evolve constantly. It doesn't get boring or repetitive very quickly at all.\n\nAnd the storms - wait until you see the storms. The environment varies just as much as the enemies, and can be just as deadly. Even when you're in a semi-safe area, you still need to watch out for everything from twisters and tornadoes, to full-blown force-5 hurricanes - and even they come in all sorts of different forms too.\n\nI was a little bit disappointed that cars weren't more lootable - I mean, you've done away with the warboys and now you have their car at your disposal, but your only option is to drive it back to the stronghold to add it to your collection if you haven't already done so. It really needs the option to scrap the car, either on the spot for some quick scrap, or back at home for increased returns. You can't even syphon the guzzolene... fortunately, or oddly, there is quite a lot of it about, so not a big deal.\n\nThere is a lot to get through in this game, and even with the small frustrations, I think I'll be playing it for a good while yet.","September 4, 2015","true","52.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There wasn't a whole lot of screwing around with the settings to be done, as it was already optimized for my PC. The controls are very easy to learn and use (as they are similar to most games). The combat so far has been fun and you feel so powerful when fighting. It's a whole lot of button mashing though and there isn't a whole ton of skill involved in the melee combat.\n\nThe story line is quite linear, but I like it! It's easy to follow along with and stay on track- but at the same time you're in an open world. I don't like games where you get lost on what to do, or where to go, and this is definitely not one of those games.\n\nI feel like the post-apocalyptic look could use some more scenery rather than just boulders and desert (yes, I know this is how the movie is), because it feels bare and somewhat static at times. Although, this is the complete opposite at some points when it comes to the intense scenes with the storms and what not.\n\nMy first two hours of the game have been pretty great. If it wasn't 4:30am already, I would play this game for hours.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game. It's a great way to pass the time in a single player environment.","September 5, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/utilizator404/recommended/234140/","utilizator404","420 NoScope","http://steamcommunity.com/id/utilizator404/","167 products in account","My initial impression was really good. It was everything i expected it to be and so much more, but as i continued playing, i started feeling a bit disappointed, there were no bikes, no big rigs, no epic huge car chases, and while the car stuff is really fun on its own, it just doesn't really capture that epic mad max car chase spirit.\n\nFurthermore, the whole game feels like it was made out of a demo of a much bigger game. This is either some really small team that was working on it or they had a very limited budget or only worked on this game part time. Like for example, every single boss fight you fight the same exact boss, the same moves and tactics and even the same 3D model (although later on it gets 2 other 3D models to mix things up a bit but its still the same moves and everything), later on they introduce another boss that is different, but it also gets reused multiple times with a different 3D model, i think it gets used 3 times in total, the rest of the boss encounters are the same guy you had to fight from your very first boss encounter.\n\nSo all in all you got like, 5 enemy types that are reskinned for every faction, 1 playable vehicle type, 2 boss types, 5 or 6 types of activities littered all over the map. While those things are awesome the first few times you do them, after some time it becomes repetitive, joyless grind, especially sh*it like finding/disarming minefields, and you have to do them all in order to unlock the car part you need.\n\nWhile at its core the gameplay is solid and mostly fun, there's a lot of things that are a not completely thought through by developer.For example, the game has a jump feature, but nothing to jump on or over, there is no platforming and the jump isn't high enough for it to be of any use. Often times you end up not being able to jump over objects that are at your knee height, and there's no climbing feature that could be combined with the jump to get on top of high objects, you can only climb things marked for climbing.There's also a knife, that you can only use once.... yeah like you stab someone and the knife disappears, having you scavenge for a new knife every time you kill a guy. There are upgrades that extend your ammo belt capacity and that also lets you have more knifes, so you end up walking around with a collection of knifes, why not just have one knife that never disappears after a kill instead of carrying 9437583 knifes with you, this is the most bizarre game design choice i have seen in a while.No matter how much you max out your car, its still week and slow as sh*it. You can have your engine maxed out but you will still have a hard time catching up to enemy cars and you will never be able to outrun them. You can add all the armor and spikes and turn your car into a barely moving tank, but they will still be able to knock your car's health by more than half in just one side ram, it feels like everything you do to make your car formidable is futile, you might just steal one of their cars and drive that instead.By default, the game has this really nice survival element to it, you have to scavenge for food, water, gasoline and ammo to survive in the wasteland, but than you get to upgrade your stronghold and this is where all this neat survival stuff gets thrown out the window. Once you get to one of your strongholds, it automatically refills your health, water, car, ammo belt. you no longer have to scavenge for anything when you are running low and finding stuff like water or gas cans no longer has that joy to it because you already have an unlimited amount of it, this is essentially like using a cheat code.\nSpeaking of stronghold upgrades, there's this one upgrade called stockpile, it costs a lot and it literally does nothing, you waste all your money that could have been used to pimp out your ride, on a thing that has no function in the game.And if we are speaking of wasting money, you cant just buy whatever upgrades you want for max and his car even if you already did the missions to unlock them, gotta waste money on all the crap ones before them first to be able to buy the ones you need.You gotta grind a lot to get it, random scrap(money is called scrap in this game) that enemies drop or you find in looting locations only give you like +2 +5 scrap, and you need 4100 of it to get that fancy V8 carburetor for your car. You waste countless hours and hours chasing after cars and looting random villages, that you could have used to actually play and enjoy the game. It's like one of those sh*itty "free" to play mobile games where you have to pay micro transactions to get game coins to be able to progress faster, only this game has no micro transactions and you are stuck with the free to play part of it.Than there's also this thing where for whatever reason, to perform an action you have to hold down E (or whatever button you assign) instead of just pressing it once. I would understand it for actions that take time like breaking doors open, but why the f*ck did they think its a good idea to make you hold E for every single action such as picking up an a weapon in the middle of combat, its so frustrating. and than there's the ridiculously tiny distances you have to be from a thing to perform an action, you can be standing right on top of a weapon but nope you cant pick it up till you move one pixel closer, its also very frustrating in combat.\n\nThe combat is good and very fun for the most part, i never got bored of it but even that has its problems.The camera will often times position itself in ways that leave you blind to whats going on around you, getting lots of cheep shots from the enemies offscreen, attacks that you never see coming.The game has sort of an element of sneaking up on the enemies, but it doesn't really work because they always somehow get alerted before you are close enough to silently execute them, its like as if they have some 360 vision or something, i only managed to sneak attack once in my entire playthrough. And also things like you turning on your flashlight in the middle of a dark room when you are standing behind enemies, does not alert them, just goes to show how much thought they put in this too.\n\nThe car combat is pretty fun too, although the game has a problem with input delay that prevents me from fully enjoying the car part, and that is a real shame because mad max is all about the car chases and stuff.The game has racing in it but it too had little to no thought given to it, the enemy drivers will fail to keep up with you and you will always end up driving alone with no one to rival you, but somehow you will still barely have time to make it to the finish line.\n\nThere are some serious technical problems with the game as well, such as a strange and very noticeable input delay on everything, while its not really a big deal and wont hinder your gameplay experience on foot, driving is another story and this is where it feels the most. It ruins the driving experience and makes some of the missions and cars borderline unplayable and undrivable.Bugged missions, events that fail to trigger making you stuck and sometimes even having redo the whole thing.\n\nThe story was terrible for the most part, the writing was bad and if you don't do the optional missions, the characters will still act like you did, leaving you clueless on what is going on. The story itself is really short and it artificially lengthens the game by forcing you to do all these repetitive "go here, do that" things, until it lets you progress further with the story.\n\nSo all in all, at first i was mind blown but than the game slowly turned into a joyless repetitive grind. The game is fun and its solid enough in general even with all the bugs and weird game design choices, but if you wanna get the most enjoyment out of this game, only do the main story missions and only do all the side quests if the main story missions forces you to do them.","September 6, 2015","true","65.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's pretty fun and mildly entertaining for few hours. Although it has some minor imperfections it proves itself to be a quite good game.\n\nPersonally I didn't get much out of the story, it was a little bit clingy and it had was just a typical video-game plot #192.\n\nThe combat system of the game appears to be somewhat similiar to Batman and Shadow of Mordor. Very well animated intense combat with multiple enemies is fun and you can actually feel the power of Max's punches. Basic combat moves are easy to learn and easy to execute when the keys that you have to press are X and Y.\n\nOne of the most important part of this game is driving. Building your own "Magnum Opus" so to speak. You can choose what body type you want to use and customize your car whilst you roam your way through the territories and cause havoc. Car handling is hard to learn and to master in the beginning of your journey but it'll get better when you actually evolve your car.\n\nThe game has some minor imperfections as I mentioned earlier. The NPC behavior for example. The NPC cars may just drive at you out of nowhere, ram you twice when you are parked and looting and try to kill you by driving over you. Well, at that point you should rush to your car and battle with them, but, sometimes this occurs: The NPC's actually dissmiss you at the exact moment you step in to your car. Then they'll drive away and try to get as far as you as possible without even noticing your existence.\n\n\nSumma summarum\n\n+ Great graphics with magnificent framerate (60 stable @ Max settings)\n+ Enjoyable combat\n+ Size of the continent\n+ A lot to do (loot, scavenge, discover)\n+ Magnum Opus\n+ Strongholds\n\n\n- NPC behaviour from time to time\n- Enemies with big weapons might hit you when the animation isn't clearly even close to you\n- Car driving can get a little bit irritating when you have to do something carefully (watch out for bombs i.e.)\n- You can't really jump\n\n\nIt's a nice game to lose twentysomething hours with, but I wouldn't pay the full price.\n\n7.5/10","September 8, 2015","true","33.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Coming from a studio that have proven themselves so capable of open-world games before, it's no surprise that the game does a great job of turning Max's world into a massive vehicular playground.\n\nThe game does an amazing job of bringing the Mad Max world to life, right down to details you don't think about in the films, such as the sheer scarcity of resources. Unfortunately that attention to detail is also the game's biggest flaw: once you've spent upwards of ten minutes just scrounging for something to restore your HP and only find enough medical supplies to heal yourself by half, you begin to realize that outside of the car chases, the Mad Max world ... really isn't all that interesting. It's just a flat desert with few settlements, all of which are cobbled together from ugly junk, and populated by scattered bands of savages whose most intelligent battle strategies are to ram you with their car or punch you in the head. The movies cut the experience down to just the cool parts - in a video game, you also have all the dull stuff in between.\n\nThat's not to say this game isn't fun - because it is, especially if you love the movies - but if you're looking for the next awesome open-world game to top Just Cause 2 or GTA V, this probably isn't it.\n\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n- Even for a game in which 90% of the world is brown sand, this game looks BEAUTIFUL. There is so much fine detail, right down to Max's tracks in the sand. If Just Cause 3 looks half this good, we have a lot to look forward to.\n- Even though the world is very empty, it makes up for this by making most objects smaller than a building destructible or otherwise interactive. Run over a rocky hillside and knock the rocks down. Ram a rusted-out car body and watch it shatter. Blow stuff up with gas cans, because nobody in Mad Max Land has ever heard of conserving fuel. It's fun just to see which environmental objects will react when you mess with them.\n- Your car, the Magnum Opus, is (somewhat) customizable, and it comes with a Jockey from Left 4 Dead 2 who performs repairs for free any time you hop out. Minor spoilers: the iconic Interceptor is stolen in the opening cutscene, but one of the Magnum Opus' body styles is nearly identical, so it's almost like you still have it. I'm 100% sure they added that just to make fans of the main car happy (like me!).\n- Lots of NPC vehicles, which are a collect-a-thon in and of themselves (can you steal them all and gather them at your strongholds?). They all look like the kind of crazy machines you'd expect to see in the movies.\n- The game and its world feel very authentically Mad-Max-esque. It feels more like Road Warrior than Fury Road, perhaps just because the action tends to be less in-your-face. The story has loads of references to Fury Road though, and the main plotline has you trying to reach Gas Town from the movie.\n- Some people hate the weird quantities in which you find Scrap (the game's currency), but I like it because it provides a touch of realism. You wouldn't find stacks of neatly-sorted and counted-out metal in a real wasteland, would you?\n- The explosions are awesome and sometimes in slow-mo!\n- The villain in the intro movie rides a ridiculous motorized throne in true Mad Max villain fashion.\n- There's a dog!\n\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n- This game reveals the disappointing truth that life in a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland isn't all high-adrenaline pedal-to-the-metal car chases. Sometimes you have to search for food. Sometimes you have to scour an abandoned camp for car parts. Sometimes you have to kill a dozen guys with your bare hands just for a sip of water. Most of the time you just have to drive in a straight line through the blank desert, hoping to stumble across something worthwhile.\n- With Chumbucket the seemingly-invincible mechanic riding the storyline's Magnum Opus vehicle and providing free repairs, there's no real reason to use any other car in the game. The MO is basically indestructible (if it gets to low HP, you just have to get out and let Chum repair it), and oftentimes you'll need Chumbucket's advice in order to complete a mission, which you won't have if you take another vehicle.\n- The Magnum Opus' customizability is fairly limited, and chances are you'll end up with all the parts by the end anyway. None of the ones I've gotten yet required me to swap out anything except the body shell, so I don't know if I'll have to choose mutually-exclusive parts down the line or not.\n- Goals aren't always clear - I have to keep talking to the same NPCs to remember what I'm supposed to do. One guy keeps telling me he's getting impatient, but I forgot what his mission actually is.\n- Combat is awkward at best and wonky at worst. Basically all you do in melee combat is spam M1 except when an enemy is about to knock you down, in which case you press M2. Car combat is limited to ramming your opponent full-force (the quickest/best option), sideswiping them repeatedly (difficult and doesn't do much damage), or impaling the other driver with the Magnum Opus's harpoon gun (fun, but not that fulfilling).\n- The keyboard controls are a bit weird, requiring you to hold down keys to perform simple actions (e.g. hold E for ~1/2 second to pick something up) rather than just tapping the key like other games. Stranger still is that it isn't even done to make up for key-taps being bound to other actions - tapping E does nothing, for instance. I'm still scratching my head as to why this is done this way.\n\n\nDefinitely recommended for fans of the Mad Max films. If you want an amazing action game and haven't played Just Cause 2 yet, go play that instead, then come back to this on a sale.","September 8, 2015","true","12.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its a wasteland), car chasing, scavenging (yep, maggots are back on the menu boys), car upgrading and brutal fighting (batman fighting gameplay) this game is for you. Honestly, the way car reacts on the sand, the sound of the engines, everything is wonderful. The way the scenery changes inside a sandstorm, is something that you have never encountered before. In general what do you do in the game now (in case you wonder)\n\n1) you scavenge small camps and abandoned vehicles like ships (i guess there was a sea over there) and you also find relics of another time that reminds you how it was once, and they really add to the feeling\n2)Destroy larger camps with enemies.\n3)Destroy big camps where you have to beat the local boss of the area\n4)participate in death races (while in open world, you can steal other cars in order to use them in these races)\n5)Help helpless people by giving them water, in exchange for information\n6) as you cross the wasteland, random gangs will attack you, or an enemy convoy will pass, that you could attack and destroy in order to gain materials and  parts.\n7) Game has soft borders. Means that there isn't any invinsible wall that will tell you "its over". Want to drive into nothingness? Go ahead. More wasteland for you. You might find something useful, or you can die there. And yes, you can find something useful outside of the map. Well done Avalanche!\n8)I almost forgot. Enemies in cars are not stupid. If they see they loose, they will run away. Its surviving afterl all is it not?\n\nWant to know the best part? I play this game for 7 hours and i haven't even unlock the half of the map.

It fits within the universe and doesn't ruin the character.\n\n+ Graphics: Impressive weather effects (especially the sand storms, which are epic), detailed and high quality textures and models (for an open world), the physics are the most impressive (how cars explode and how debris gets knocked around or breaks into pieces). No visual disturbances to speak of, a very good looking game.\n\n+ Sound: The engines, the punches, the shotgun and sniper, explosions, storms and hurricane-like winds are all fantastic.\n\n+ Gameplay: Batman combat system (melee) meets twisted metal and burnout (vehicles) meets a standard open world Ubisoft game (collect loot and hidden items at locations around the map). It's nice to have a game where collecting loot actually matters, in the sense that you can upgrade Max's vehicles and abilities, and history artifacts give the universe some depth.\n\n- There isn't that much gameplay variety here; collecting loot, ransacking and liberating strongholds and bases, races, driving around, BUT at least the driving and vehicular combat is fun as hell, otherwise I wouldn't recommend this game.\n\n- This has been said on every review, and it's true, the story and characters are lacking. You won't find memorable or compelling characters here, even Max kind of falls short, but the experience of driving through the wasteland and blowing ♥♥♥♥ up like in the movies is like none other. Still a fun game to play even if you aren't totally invested in it's plot.\n\nI usually wait for sales for games and I hardly ever preorder or buy day one release, but this game was worth every penny.

PC support is great, a lot of graphics options, including being able to change audio output device ingame (from speaker to headphones, for example). Haven't seen that in a game in a long time.\n\nControls:\n\nSeamless transition from controller to keyboard/mouse - if you want to use your 360 controller for driving and kb/m for shooting (of honestly, there is little of), you can.\nAlmost all combat is either car or melee arkham-style punchin'. The very few times where aim is required, there are 'quickshots' available, so playing this all on a controller is perfectly doable.\nKeyboard/mouse controls work fine. They're not bad by default, they're all remappable, and the melee combat controls are almost all centered on LMB/RMB. Remapping basic functions to a thumb or extra mouse button works, and the ingame prompts updated as expected.\n\nGame:\n\nAtmosphere is very much in line with Mad Max and/or Fury Road, melee combat is similar to the Arkham games. Car combat is (so far) fairly simple, but really fun.\n\nThere are upgrades. A LOT of upgrades. There's over a dozen categories of car upgrades - each with varying levels, at least a dozen 'passive' upgrads (fuel use, water consumption, scrap collection, ....) and then a bunch more Max-only upgrades for melee combat or cosmetics.\n\nIt being an openworld game, there is going to be some busywork to unlock them - but so far it doesn't feel like it because most of the encounters will have scrap, water, or fuel as a bonus - all of which you need.\n\nClosest comparison with regard to the openworld game? Just Cause 2 and Far Cry 4 - Open world with unlockables, upgrades based on exploration, and camps to be liberated.\n\nIf you like the Mad Max setting, or want an openworld game similar to the Arkham series while also driving a spiky, flamethrowing, harpoon-shooting car across the desert wasteland; this is for you.\n\nMinor beef: Playing on an AZERTY board, the controls (ingame and when remapping) will say, for example, 'W' for forward as per qwerty, but when remapping it will show no change. However it functions fine on azerty. It just makes some of the tutorials/ingame tips weird when starting out if you play on azerty.","September 1, 2015","true","48.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gadzooks/recommended/234140/","gadzooks","Gadzooks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gadzooks/","707 products in account","Very under rated game.\n\nMost open world games lose my interest fast as they involve a lot of repeat content. All those side activities and missions end up feeling indentical after you have done a few.  I figured madmax would be the same. I was pleasantly surprised when I started noticing how each little side area and objective were not only hand crafted/designed to be different, but many had different mechanics from each other. No two warcamps are the same. Hell, even the balloon quick travel points are different and require a unique mechanic to complete (ie: one might require you to refuel the balloon, another has you driving your car around to remove the cables that are tieing it down).\n\nThe game feels very mad max. The world is closer to feeling like the newer film than the older (which is fine, I love all of them). Driving is a lot of fun, and the batman like combat is also fun. I enjoy the combat in this better than in batman for a few reasons. 1. The rage system - It makes combat that much more interesting than in batman. 2. Unlike batman, there are times when you realistically just cant counter an attack, even if you see it coming. If you are in the middle of grabbing some guy and breaking his neck, its just not realistic to think that you can suddenly counter another attack. Dont worry though, you can still counter 9 out of 10 attacks if your timing is good, but there is a bit more realism with the system than there is in Batman (where you will go flying accorss the screen no matter what you were doing, to counter an attack).\n\nThe amount of customization and upgrades in the game is pretty insane too. You have TONS of car options and upgrades, character upgrades, a skill/train system with upgrades, and a "hideout" upgrade system that lets you build things in your base of operations. The car upgrades are by far the most impressive. The sheer number of things you can add and customize is great.\n\nThe voice acting is also top notch and very accurate with a Max film. The characters all have that no longer part of the reality we know behavior, much like the films.\n\nThe visuals in the game look very appealing too. Sure, its not super 4k ultra mega Alpha X resolution textures and special FX, but it still looks darn good. Not only that, it runs VERY well. Smooth framerates 99.9% of the time, plenty of video options to adjust. No complaints here, and im VERY picky about graphics and graphical options.\n\nMy ONLY 2 gripes about the game:\n\n1. Getting enemies OFF your car is just a pain. Even after you put spikes all over your car, people will still jump on it. If you are low on shotgun ammo (which you are most of the game), you dont have an easy way to remove them. Smashing into another car sometimes does the trick, but if you dont have another car to smash into, then the best option, believe it or not... is to stop your car... AND GET OUT. WTF?? Really? It really breaks the whole "high speed action car chase" if the best option is to stop and get out.\n\nId like them to add some more ways to remove enemies. Especially if they are on the driver side. Let Max reach out and punch or pull them off the car. Maybe your hunchback can push them off? Maybe once you have spikes, it drains their life the longer they are on the car, until they die and fall off? Something more needs to be added. Its a minor gripe, but one that pops up every so often during car combat.\n\n2. Climbing up on things. Imagine this situation. 2 cargo storage containers. Both the same size. One has a yellow marked metal bar on top, signifying that you can jump up, grab it, and pull yourself up. The other doesnt. Er... why cant I climb the other one? Worse yet, there are things that are only 3-4 feet high that you cant grab and pull yourself up to.\n\nThankfully, most of the game doesnt revovle around needing to get up on these things, but from an open world exploration, or even "which path should i take" aspect, it can be kinda annoying.\n\n\nBoth of these things however dont take away from the games fun, or keep me from recommending it. The game is a blast to play and a visual feast for mad max fans.\n\nThe one thing id like to see from a DLC, would be a co-op play via the net. Would be super fun to do all the racing and car combat with another person by your side.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Will-T/recommended/234140/","Will-T","Will T.TVR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Will-T/","202 products in account","Made by the same studio that made the legendary Just Cause 2 (best $5 you can spend on Steam, by the way - nab it in the next sale!), Mad Max is an open-world game in the Just Cause vein, but set (as you can guess) in the world of the Mad Max films. Coming from a studio that have proven themselves so capable of open-world games before, it's no surprise that the game does a great job of turning Max's world into a massive vehicular playground.\n\nThe game does an amazing job of bringing the Mad Max world to life, right down to details you don't think about in the films, such as the sheer scarcity of resources. Unfortunately that attention to detail is also the game's biggest flaw: once you've spent upwards of ten minutes just scrounging for something to restore your HP and only find enough medical supplies to heal yourself by half, you begin to realize that outside of the car chases, the Mad Max world ... really isn't all that interesting. It's just a flat desert with few settlements, all of which are cobbled together from ugly junk, and populated by scattered bands of savages whose most intelligent battle strategies are to ram you with their car or punch you in the head. The movies cut the experience down to just the cool parts - in a video game, you also have all the dull stuff in between.\n\nThat's not to say this game isn't fun - because it is, especially if you love the movies - but if you're looking for the next awesome open-world game to top Just Cause 2 or GTA V, this probably isn't it.\n\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n- Even for a game in which 90% of the world is brown sand, this game looks BEAUTIFUL. There is so much fine detail, right down to Max's tracks in the sand. If Just Cause 3 looks half this good, we have a lot to look forward to.\n- Even though the world is very empty, it makes up for this by making most objects smaller than a building destructible or otherwise interactive. Run over a rocky hillside and knock the rocks down. Ram a rusted-out car body and watch it shatter. Blow stuff up with gas cans, because nobody in Mad Max Land has ever heard of conserving fuel. It's fun just to see which environmental objects will react when you mess with them.\n- Your car, the Magnum Opus, is (somewhat) customizable, and it comes with a Jockey from Left 4 Dead 2 who performs repairs for free any time you hop out. Minor spoilers: the iconic Interceptor is stolen in the opening cutscene, but one of the Magnum Opus' body styles is nearly identical, so it's almost like you still have it. I'm 100% sure they added that just to make fans of the main car happy (like me!).\n- Lots of NPC vehicles, which are a collect-a-thon in and of themselves (can you steal them all and gather them at your strongholds?). They all look like the kind of crazy machines you'd expect to see in the movies.\n- The game and its world feel very authentically Mad-Max-esque. It feels more like Road Warrior than Fury Road, perhaps just because the action tends to be less in-your-face. The story has loads of references to Fury Road though, and the main plotline has you trying to reach Gas Town from the movie.\n- Some people hate the weird quantities in which you find Scrap (the game's currency), but I like it because it provides a touch of realism. You wouldn't find stacks of neatly-sorted and counted-out metal in a real wasteland, would you?\n- The explosions are awesome and sometimes in slow-mo!\n- The villain in the intro movie rides a ridiculous motorized throne in true Mad Max villain fashion.\n- There's a dog!\n\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n- This game reveals the disappointing truth that life in a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland isn't all high-adrenaline pedal-to-the-metal car chases. Sometimes you have to search for food. Sometimes you have to scour an abandoned camp for car parts. Sometimes you have to kill a dozen guys with your bare hands just for a sip of water. Most of the time you just have to drive in a straight line through the blank desert, hoping to stumble across something worthwhile.\n- With Chumbucket the seemingly-invincible mechanic riding the storyline's Magnum Opus vehicle and providing free repairs, there's no real reason to use any other car in the game. The MO is basically indestructible (if it gets to low HP, you just have to get out and let Chum repair it), and oftentimes you'll need Chumbucket's advice in order to complete a mission, which you won't have if you take another vehicle.\n- The Magnum Opus' customizability is fairly limited, and chances are you'll end up with all the parts by the end anyway. None of the ones I've gotten yet required me to swap out anything except the body shell, so I don't know if I'll have to choose mutually-exclusive parts down the line or not.\n- Goals aren't always clear - I have to keep talking to the same NPCs to remember what I'm supposed to do. One guy keeps telling me he's getting impatient, but I forgot what his mission actually is.\n- Combat is awkward at best and wonky at worst. Basically all you do in melee combat is spam M1 except when an enemy is about to knock you down, in which case you press M2. Car combat is limited to ramming your opponent full-force (the quickest/best option), sideswiping them repeatedly (difficult and doesn't do much damage), or impaling the other driver with the Magnum Opus's harpoon gun (fun, but not that fulfilling).\n- The keyboard controls are a bit weird, requiring you to hold down keys to perform simple actions (e.g. hold E for ~1/2 second to pick something up) rather than just tapping the key like other games. Stranger still is that it isn't even done to make up for key-taps being bound to other actions - tapping E does nothing, for instance. I'm still scratching my head as to why this is done this way.\n\n\nDefinitely recommended for fans of the Mad Max films. If you want an amazing action game and haven't played Just Cause 2 yet, go play that instead, then come back to this on a sale.","September 8, 2015","true","12.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's pretty fun and mildly entertaining for few hours. Although it has some minor imperfections it proves itself to be a quite good game.\n\nPersonally I didn't get much out of the story, it was a little bit clingy and it had was just a typical video-game plot #192.\n\nThe combat system of the game appears to be somewhat similiar to Batman and Shadow of Mordor. Very well animated intense combat with multiple enemies is fun and you can actually feel the power of Max's punches. Basic combat moves are easy to learn and easy to execute when the keys that you have to press are X and Y.\n\nOne of the most important part of this game is driving. Building your own "Magnum Opus" so to speak. You can choose what body type you want to use and customize your car whilst you roam your way through the territories and cause havoc. Car handling is hard to learn and to master in the beginning of your journey but it'll get better when you actually evolve your car.\n\nThe game has some minor imperfections as I mentioned earlier. The NPC behavior for example. The NPC cars may just drive at you out of nowhere, ram you twice when you are parked and looting and try to kill you by driving over you. Well, at that point you should rush to your car and battle with them, but, sometimes this occurs: The NPC's actually dissmiss you at the exact moment you step in to your car. Then they'll drive away and try to get as far as you as possible without even noticing your existence.\n\n\nSumma summarum\n\n+ Great graphics with magnificent framerate (60 stable @ Max settings)\n+ Enjoyable combat\n+ Size of the continent\n+ A lot to do (loot, scavenge, discover)\n+ Magnum Opus\n+ Strongholds\n\n\n- NPC behaviour from time to time\n- Enemies with big weapons might hit you when the animation isn't clearly even close to you\n- Car driving can get a little bit irritating when you have to do something carefully (watch out for bombs i.e.)\n- You can't really jump\n\n\nIt's a nice game to lose twentysomething hours with, but I wouldn't pay the full price.\n\n7.5/10","September 8, 2015","true","33.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Regrettably, no.\n\nMad Max has a monotonous grind to it. But if you can see the details that make it stand out.  The story is good albeit short and the actors are great. The final showdown was simple and quick. The bosses weaknesses and methods are identical except for Stank Gum and Scrotus (who has only a slight variation to the regular bosses). Which was refreshing but still not too difficult. The map is rich in areas to explore. The airport terminal was expecially cool but quick.\n\nAll in all it is designed as a console arcade game and the learning curve is very easy. There were times that I wished some fights would drag on. Early on convoy takedowns required time and strategy but as soon as you got the exploding harpoons they became easy and boring.\n\nI played 20 hours trying to clear each area then got bored and rushed through the story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gadzooks/recommended/234140/","gadzooks","Gadzooks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gadzooks/","707 products in account","Very under rated game.\n\nMost open world games lose my interest fast as they involve a lot of repeat content. All those side activities and missions end up feeling indentical after you have done a few.  I figured madmax would be the same. I was pleasantly surprised when I started noticing how each little side area and objective were not only hand crafted/designed to be different, but many had different mechanics from each other. No two warcamps are the same. Hell, even the balloon quick travel points are different and require a unique mechanic to complete (ie: one might require you to refuel the balloon, another has you driving your car around to remove the cables that are tieing it down).\n\nThe game feels very mad max. The world is closer to feeling like the newer film than the older (which is fine, I love all of them). Driving is a lot of fun, and the batman like combat is also fun. I enjoy the combat in this better than in batman for a few reasons. 1. The rage system - It makes combat that much more interesting than in batman. 2. Unlike batman, there are times when you realistically just cant counter an attack, even if you see it coming. If you are in the middle of grabbing some guy and breaking his neck, its just not realistic to think that you can suddenly counter another attack. Dont worry though, you can still counter 9 out of 10 attacks if your timing is good, but there is a bit more realism with the system than there is in Batman (where you will go flying accorss the screen no matter what you were doing, to counter an attack).\n\nThe amount of customization and upgrades in the game is pretty insane too. You have TONS of car options and upgrades, character upgrades, a skill/train system with upgrades, and a "hideout" upgrade system that lets you build things in your base of operations. The car upgrades are by far the most impressive. The sheer number of things you can add and customize is great.\n\nThe voice acting is also top notch and very accurate with a Max film. The characters all have that no longer part of the reality we know behavior, much like the films.\n\nThe visuals in the game look very appealing too. Sure, its not super 4k ultra mega Alpha X resolution textures and special FX, but it still looks darn good. Not only that, it runs VERY well. Smooth framerates 99.9% of the time, plenty of video options to adjust. No complaints here, and im VERY picky about graphics and graphical options.\n\nMy ONLY 2 gripes about the game:\n\n1. Getting enemies OFF your car is just a pain. Even after you put spikes all over your car, people will still jump on it. If you are low on shotgun ammo (which you are most of the game), you dont have an easy way to remove them. Smashing into another car sometimes does the trick, but if you dont have another car to smash into, then the best option, believe it or not... is to stop your car... AND GET OUT. WTF?? Really? It really breaks the whole "high speed action car chase" if the best option is to stop and get out.\n\nId like them to add some more ways to remove enemies. Especially if they are on the driver side. Let Max reach out and punch or pull them off the car. Maybe your hunchback can push them off? Maybe once you have spikes, it drains their life the longer they are on the car, until they die and fall off? Something more needs to be added. Its a minor gripe, but one that pops up every so often during car combat.\n\n2. Climbing up on things. Imagine this situation. 2 cargo storage containers. Both the same size. One has a yellow marked metal bar on top, signifying that you can jump up, grab it, and pull yourself up. The other doesnt. Er... why cant I climb the other one? Worse yet, there are things that are only 3-4 feet high that you cant grab and pull yourself up to.\n\nThankfully, most of the game doesnt revovle around needing to get up on these things, but from an open world exploration, or even "which path should i take" aspect, it can be kinda annoying.\n\n\nBoth of these things however dont take away from the games fun, or keep me from recommending it. The game is a blast to play and a visual feast for mad max fans.\n\nThe one thing id like to see from a DLC, would be a co-op play via the net. Would be super fun to do all the racing and car combat with another person by your side.

Overall it was a little repetitive, but you can always go through the story faster then doing all the side missions/ objectives like I did.  Customizing your car to suit how you like to play was cool as well.  Scrap is a little hard to find at times.

Just listen to how the engine note of the Magnum Opus changes slightly with every upgrade or take Chumbucket's buggy rockclimbing and note the detailed suspension movement. This is a solid game.\n\nThis game plays great with a keyboard, but doesn't support controllers other than a 360 pad. Steering wheel support should have been a consideration with a game so heavily focused on driving.\n\nOccasional UI glitches appear; Most of the time your mouse cursor will appear over gameplay, which can be solved by pausing and unpausing. Other times, the pause menu's back button will continue to be drawn over gameplay, which can be fixed by clicking it. Other than that, the game runs flawlessly.\n\nThe game looks somewhat difficult to mod, with all data files being stored in proprietary archives. As a singleplayer-only game, mods and user-generated content are key to its survival.","September 2, 2015","true","35.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The guy has taken mechanics to a whole new level.. a religion for him.  His finest creation, the Magnum Opus, is your ticket out of the Wasteland.

You never know what you might find over the next dune, a convoy?  A fuel depot?  A gang of vicious killers bent on taking your life and car?\nA blast to play, with tons of optimizations for optimal performance on PC.  8/10\n\n*EDIT*  Just finished the game at 51 hours playtime.  I have not completed all the acheviements or 100% complete the game.  I have done all the story missions and all the sidemissions.

Not too strong of a story but it's Mad Max. Lots of violence and things blowing up. Badass cars and a well crafted post-apocalyptic wasteland.\n\nCouple of complaints I have is that the game gets repetetive, going from territory to territory scavenging scraps and collectibles, clearing out camps of baddies yet I couldn't stop playing. I also ran into bugs once in a while like clipping through objects or character body parts dissapearing and mines in the minefield not showing up properly. Coincidentally this game was made by Avalanche, same developer that made Just Cause 3 and somehow this game didn't turn out to be a buggy mess like that one but I digress.\n\nThe things I liked were the cars, specifically the Magnum Opus, the pinnacle of badassery. The wasteland itself could be quite beautiful and pretty to look at too during certain hours of the in-game day. The flow of combat is pretty simple and looks great when chaining combos and counters together. You get a sidekick named Chumbucket who's just the best lil hunchback sidekick ever.\n\nI had a lot of fun with it and would definately recommend it to strangers and my friends if they like driving and action games.","January 1","true","72.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You get in line, see how "awesome" it's going to be and get pumped up! As soon as the ride starts you begin to climb the first hill, and then WOOSH! Down you go screaming in a blaze of glory! Now you hear the click of the track as you begin another climb up a hill. You think "Okay, this is gonna be cooler!" and WOOSH! Down the same blaze of glory. Then another click and climb... 300 hills later you're thinking to yourself "This isn't bad but geez, I'm getting nausous from these hills."\n\nThat's Mad Max: The Video Game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/234140/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nReleased only a few months after the movie franchise reboot "Mad Max: Fury Road", Mad Max isn't just another one of those movie-adaptation video games to follow the same background and story, but instead it takes inspiration from the entire movie franchise to create a unique experience, as the game is more like prequel to Fury Road, introducing you to the world of Max Mad without the need for any prior knowledge about the series. Mad Max aims for a story about a pointless existence of murder and regret, which does have its moments in situations where your actions will end up messing up other people's lives as well as your own, but just like many other games of its kind the stories that will stay with you afterwards are the ones you make yourself on the road to the finale. The story follows Max, who is once again left with nothing after Scabrous Scrotus took his car, on his journey for revenge accompanied by Chumbucket, a lonely blackfinger whose only goal is to build to ultimate ride. Along this journey you will meet all different kinds of insane people, starting with the Stronghold leaders, which will give you different side quests to complete across the wasteland and ending with all the stranger encounters that will sometimes give you scrap as a token of their gratitude for your fight against Lord Scrotus or useful information to help you take over a camp, such as the location of a secret entrance or different weaknesses in the structure that you can take advantage of. The story missions are only a small part of what Mad Max has to offer, as there are plenty of things to distract you along the way and on that side of things, the game gives you plenty of things to do to spice up your adventures, with camps to take over, scavenging locations to complete and many more; the order in which you complete those is totally up to you and completing different activities along the way is what makes Mad Max an enjoyable experience, even when it does come with its flaws.\nRating: 9\n\nGameplay\nIf you have played some of the major open world games released in the past year such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, you will most likely find similarities in Mad Max's gameplay mechanics. On foot, the main combat element is brawling, as you will use simple attack and counter attack movements to defeat various types of enemies along the way, as the only weapon in your arsenal while on foot is your loyal shotgun, which does have limited ammo, so using it carefully between punches to defeat a more dangerous enemy approaching you is key. Driving your Magnum Opus things change, as the ultimate goal is upgrading your car to make it the best ride across the wastelands, as you will unlock new car bodies, engines, suspensions and many more customizable elements; with that being said, your Magnum Opus is equipped with a Harpoon that can be used to drag and pull different objects or structures, as well as a Thunderpoon and Side Burners. In addition to the weapons that can be attached to the Magnum Opus, the car itself can be used as a weapon, as different upgrades such as Boarder Spikes, Armour or Boost will come in handy if you want to be more aggressive and slam into other vehicles. While the main missions will give you an idea of how harsh the world of Mad Max is and introduce you to different elements of the game, the best way to experience what Mad Max has to offer is by going out to explore the different events and locations on your own, as there are numerous races to complete, camps to take over and scavenging locations filled with scrap and upgrade parts for your projects in the Strongholds. As large in scale as it is, Mad Max feels really limited when it comes to movement freedom, as you will often head for a cliff that looks easy to reach only to find out that there is no way for you to get there, as the movement mechanic only allows you to climb marked locations. On top of that, the game does come with the occasional bugs and glitches, but those are minor enough not to influence your experience too much.\nRating; 8\n\nGraphics\nFor a deserted wasteland, the world of Mad Max is quite beautiful in its own gloomy way, with detailed locations and memorable places; contributing to that world are the insane characters you will meet along the way, each with its unique personality and level of madness. The weather effects have a significant impact on the world, as nights will make the desert look even more lonely and storms will reduce the visibility to a point where looking ahead of you will become your main objective. Animations can be a bit clunky at times and there are some texture popping issues, the number of them varying from one platform to another, but those are only minor issues that barely distract you from the massive world that lies ahead of you.\nRating: 8\n\nAudio\nBren Foster is the voice of Max and does a great job narrating every dramatic moment of Max's adventures, accompanied by other noted actors such as Travis Willingham voicing Lord Scrotus and Jason Spisak providing the voice of Chumbucket. The sound effects are okay and even though they can feel a bit repetitive at times, there is enough variety in action to make sounds feel distinct and take you on an emotional ride from one dramatic moment to the next one and straight back into the chaotic action afterwards.\nRating: 8.5\n\nExtras\nYou can probably finish the story within 15 hours if you go straight forward from one mission to the next one and complete only what is necessary, but with so many things around you that will probably not be the case, so with all the races, camps and locations to explore you can easily spend 50 hours with Mad Max, add even more if you're willing to complete every challenge.\nRating: 9.5\n\nVerdict\nMad Max is an excellent open world adventure no matter if you're a fan of the movies or not, as the game does a great job introducing you to the world of the franchise and tell you an interesting story without sacrificing too much on the fun, chaotic gameplay that will keep you hooked for hours. If you want a game to keep you preoccupied for a long period of time, Mad Max is definitely a must try as it provides more than enough content and variety to entertaining you for a couple of days.\nRating Overall: 8.6\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Mad Max at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=371","December 24, 2015","true","57.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Considering that includes Super Metroid, Mass Effect 2 and Witcher 3, that has to mean something!\n\nI must preface this review: it's been years since I have personally had a game like Mad Max land on my doorstep. A game that is just pure fun, that is almost completely stress-free, yet at the same time is not stupid and mindless with mediocre gameplay. Oh no. This is a great game.\n\nSo, let's begin (no spoilers).\n\n--\n\nMad Max shares a lot of similarities to Far Cry 3 and 4. It's just a huge open world with a bunch of objectives to complete and places to explore. There's the story, but you kind of do it inbetween your open world rampage. That's definitely not the primary reason to get the game, but it's not a bad part of the package. You play this game to have a blast.\n\nSome of the objectives feel repetitive, a common point of recent critic reviews, but the gameplay more than makes up for it. There's nothing like ripping around a huge open world slaying man-scum. More on that later.\n\nUpgrading your vehicle feels good. The scrap system is simple, yet at the same time demands that you make choices about what equipment you really want to purchase. Speed? Buy that. Armor? Buy that! There's some complexity involved in some gear having weight, where you have to decide on whether a piece is worth its trade-off. It's a great upgrade mechanic that remains minimalistic without hurting the complexity involved.\n\nRelated to upgrades: there is something called the "Archangels" system, which is somewhat like gear loadouts. Neutral towards it, as I didn't, personally, find it very useful after the first mission that required it.\n\nWhat you will find is that the game throws a lot of tools at you, and you are free to embrace or disregard a lot of them (such as the Archangel system). The game lets you play how you really want to play, without punishing you.\n\nSpeaking of gameplay: it feels raw and powerful. In fact, stuff happens in this game - quite often - that makes you pause for a moment, regain footing in reality, and ask: did that just happen?\n\nFor example, I engaged a convoy during a dust storm, and it was one of the most epic moments in recent memory for gaming. Cars got picked up and blown to pieces in a giant dust devil - while lighting was striking the ground rampantly all over the place - and, immediately after, the final cars were picked off by ramming them over a cliff, in which they exploded in a fiery blossom of pure carnage as I landed with a cool half-donut slide across the sand. This is something that occurs several times throughout your Mad Max experience.\n\nWhat further enhances the gameplay are the small details. The fact, for example, that you can pick up a gas can and place it in the back of your vehicle as a spare only enhances the immersive grip of the game. And there are small details like that everywhere. I'll hold back on spilling them here. They are much more enjoyable and respectable when witnessing them firsthand, for the first time.\n\nThe graphics are superb. Some of the effects are jaw-dropping. There are some very neat smoke, particle and dust tricks that I just have to appreciate as a Unity hobbyist. The backdrops are some of the best I've ever seen. It can be very immersive if you let yourself get absorbed by the endlessness of the great sandy plains.\n\nThe level design is out of this world. It was painstakingly handcrafted, and it's obvious that was the case. It's my personal favorite part of Mad Max, and I would argue it's some of the best level design for this generation of games (if not overall, at least in the category of open world). Dead ocean is the primary setting, and it's incredibly imaginative. The rolling dunes, cascading sheets of dead-ocean rock, mountainous crags and canyons, sulfur-spewing flats, rusty car graveyards and half-buried ruinous bandit strongholds--when you step back, pause a moment, and stare, you will find yourself silent. The world is amazing, engrossing; the world is truely barren and apocalyptic, yet beautiful in its own, twisted way.\n\nJust as the game world feels endless, the amount of stuff to do is also up there. Racing and collectibles are on that checklist of stuff to do once the main story and territory control begins to near completion. The collection system actually has gameplay-focused elements: you can drive captured bandit vehicles and the special, collectible hood ornaments actually have statistical value as car equipment. They are not big parts of the game, but it definitely beats the seemingly infinite amount of worthless collectible garbage that other companies forcefully shove into their products.\n\nThe only negative tick on my list of Mad Max items is the repetitive missions. There are a few variants of outposts to capture, but the game would have been even better if there were more creative mechanics put into these, especially considering they take away from the (superior, I'd argue) car-based gameplay. That said, the level design is a spectacular solution on this front. The objectives feel the same, but the outposts definitely do not, and they boast some of the coolest realizations of beat-down apocalyptic shanty-fortresses that I've had the pleasure of visiting.\n\nA bandit fortress propped atop a decaying oil rig platform in the middle of a salt-covered, dune-laden, dead ocean floor? Count me in.\n\nLast but not least: the game runs AWESOME on PC! I'll refrain from any Batman references, heh. Look at the top reviews for those, they are pretty funny. I'm getting a solid 120 FPS at basically "Max" (hah!) everything on a GTX980/FX8350.

Metal Gear Solid 5 is really something special but it does not outshine the diamond in the rough that is Mad Max.\n\nMad Max is a game drive by two game play style first the weaker of the two is the hand to hand combat which is very similar to the Batman Arkham games, but lacking all the recent upgrades those games have gotten and resembling more of the first game. I find it simple fun and easy to play especially using the mouse and keyboard. Where this game shines more is the driving combat which start with the feel of driving. Driving in this game is very solid and has a vibe of "Driver" from the original PlayStation. The games driving has this heavy feeling to it, and you really feel the weight behind all the impact. The road rage combat is great and very creative in how many different ways you can take out your enemies while on 4 wheels.\n\nA lot of Mad Max roots seem to stem from other games from the past from its combat to exploration. This game has a very late 90's feeling from the sense of the collecta thon lists. This game is riddled with check boxes and areas to complete and collect 100% to clear these areas, so the OCD in any of us will be very happy. However, this does more than just feed the hunger of ones OCD, but encourages progression within the game. You are always rewarded and progress is constantly made.\n\nPerformance is a big deal now of days with gaming, and I am happy to report that this games runs very very well on my gaming laptop and PC. While both my stations are on the high end spectrum I did notice that everything ran smooth and no bugs to report. The game launches with out any issues, updated, and performance was rock solid. The visual fidelity is great and reminded me again of another game which was RAGE by it. Rage was a very similar game sadly it focused more on the technology than the gameplay where this game does the opposite luckily. Sound is great the music and ambient noise suites the game just right, and the voice overs while disturbing were all a pleasure to listen to and hear more about this world.\n\nOverall this is very much a must play game; needless to say I am sure most of us have other things on the burner right now. However, see to make some time to visit the world of Mad Max and you will be rewarded for yoru time and patience with it. The game is a fun, simple, and can be picked up when ever you feel like it.\n","January 7","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has all the aspects of an Avalance game: great optimization, fun gameplay, nonexistent laughable storyline, great graphics, intoxicated physics and LOOOOAAAADS of grind.\n\nJust like all their games, it does outstay it's welcome by constantly pushing you to be a competionist, whether it be to unlock upgrades that make certain missions less than insufferable, by constant reminders of everyone around you that you have to do these activities or just plain old UI pestering and game currency collection.\n\nWhile the brawling is good and has some amazing bone cracking sounds, the car combat is far from perfect. Your car - the Magnum Opus is incredibly squishy, regardless of whether you put armour on it or not (and armour makes the car nearly impossible to control well, so there is no reason to ever use it in my opinion) and while that would be fine under different circumstances, they decided it would be a great idea to add 2 more lifebars to enemy vehicles that block your harpoon attacks until you deplete them. Thing is: by the time you do deplete them 2 things happen:\nFirst their basic health is basically nothing, they will likely die in one hit or you can pull a wheel/driver off them.\nSecond you will be dead bored by the time that happens (or just dead, if you ran out of rockets or physics sent you in a spin for no reason). In short: the best way to deal with enemies in vehciles is to stop the car and force them out into melee combat. That's not what you want for your car combat part.\n\nOtherwise it's a fun game and if you are a completionist who can endure the same tasks for many many hours to unlock everything, you will love this game, because it really REALLY wants you to do it and rewards you a lot for it. The question is: once you complete everything and there's nothing to do, what do you do with all these unlocked upgrades? I guess the devs didn't think about that.\n\nI recommend it based on production quality and mellee combat. The game does outstay it's welcome and I did rush the last 2 story missions without doing anything in-between because I couldn't be bothered (and not because of the story, please don't expect any good storyline from this game), but for the most part I enjoyed it's explosive ride across the prettiest of lifeless colourless, empty and monotonous deserts I have ever seen in a game to date.\n\nI also ate maggots from a corpse to replenish health. Just so you know: corpse fly maggots eat rotting flesh with bacteria happily festering inside. If you were to eat them, you'd most likely die within the next hour.","September 8, 2015","true","30.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Regrettably, no.\n\nMad Max has a monotonous grind to it. But if you can see the details that make it stand out.  The story is good albeit short and the actors are great. The final showdown was simple and quick. The bosses weaknesses and methods are identical except for Stank Gum and Scrotus (who has only a slight variation to the regular bosses). Which was refreshing but still not too difficult. The map is rich in areas to explore. The airport terminal was expecially cool but quick.\n\nAll in all it is designed as a console arcade game and the learning curve is very easy. There were times that I wished some fights would drag on. Early on convoy takedowns required time and strategy but as soon as you got the exploding harpoons they became easy and boring.\n\nI played 20 hours trying to clear each area then got bored and rushed through the story. I just got tired of collecting loot.  So if you would like to support the devs then pay full retail but if your on a budget then I suggest you wait for the sale.

It's shallow gameplay is outstnding fun when taken in small doses.  Just don't plan on powering your way through this game in a few sittings; if you do, the lack of polish, disjointed story, and repetition (oh lord, the repetition!)  will kill your buzz all too soon.\n\nMad Max has been compared and found wanting to Assassin's Creed and Batman: Arhkam games (and rightly so while on foot), but the best part of Mad Max takes place behind the wheel.  The car chases (enemies chasing you and vice versa) and convoy battles will stick with you and drive you to play even more  ...at least while they last.  Unfortunately, there are only a limited number of convoy missions (and no free-roam convoys), which is a shame since this seems to be every player's favorite activity.  There are still randomly spawning enemy vehicles roaming the wastes, but they seem fewer and fewer as the game progresses, and enemies flat out run away once your vehicle becomes moderately equipped.\n\nIf you're looking for a good gap filler - a game to play when the latest MMO has become stale, but before another massive time-sync game - this is a great place to start.

It's very well optimized, it looks gorgeous and the gameplay feels good and works well. The story is not bad but it's not great either. It's pretty generic and is made up of the most common themes of RPGs.\n\nThe combat feels satisfying but is most of the time not a big challenge as your enemies will almost always attack one at a time which can easily be dealt with by parrying. If there are multiple types of enemies performing different types of attacks in can get quite tough at times.\nThe driving in this game is very good. The sound of the different types of engines are great, the handling feels realistic while still being arcadey enough to be fun and challanging at the same time and the vehicular combat works well.\nMad Max looks really good. Not particularly in terms of texture quality but some of the effects are really stunning especially the explosions. The atmosphere of the whole post-apocalyptic wasteland is also very believable and authentic.

As such, I wasn’t really excited for it, and only picked it up on sale because I have been a huge fan of the films for many years and couldn’t get over how awesome Fury Road was.  However, I was really glad to find out that the critics got this one wrong.\n\nFirst off, if this is boring, repetitive and derivative, its no more so than Shadows of More Door or any of the Arkham or recent Asscreed games.  Also, unlike Arkham Knight, this actually runs at more than 5fps.\n\nMad Max the game is a bit of a contrast to Mad Max the movies.  Game Max is a sort of wastleand Captain America who goes around helping people, giving water to thirsty drifters and brawling like a part-time UFC fighter, nothing like the tormented and twisted survivor of the films.  You also spend alot of time DESTROYING oil pumps, the most valuable thing in the wastleland.  But put that aside, and you'll find a brilliant, open worldy game that is most fun when you make you're own fun.\n\nStory missions are just glorified excuses to obtain upgrades for your car.  Mad Max is at its best and most immersive when you go off rails and just explore.  Avalanche have given us one of the most beautiful game worlds (perfectly optimized for pc) i can think of in their stunning rendition of the wastleland, from the burnt-out buildings and sweeping dunes to the ramshackle monstrosities of the settlements.  You spend most of the game in your customizeable car, and its a real joy to both drive around and see whats cookin' or to engage in the exhilirating car combat, which does actually nail the feel of the movies dead on and gives you a lot of fun toys to play with.  Taking on convoys is the highlight of the game for me, without doubt.  There's also some interesting underground sections too, which are a nice change of pace.\n\nWhen not in the car, you raid settlements, sabotage oil pumps, and generally have a jolly time biffing people in the face.  While many said the combat was awful, I loved ever minute I was ramming fists into mouths.  Mad Max's fisticuffs is heavily based on the very familiar Arkham system, but it work by giving you so much more control over what you are doing, with light and heavy attacks, combo finishers, weapons (THUNDERSTICKS!!!) and ability to get Max's shotgun into the mix.  Even sometimes Max loses his rag and starts drop kicking and suplexing mofos.  Seriously, once you've unlocked enough moves combat is just as good as the Batman games and definitely better than Asscreed.  Like I mentioned before, the fighting doesn't fit in well with the Max of the movies, but when you're ramming a thunderstick (grenade on a spear) into someones gut amd kicking him into a mob of bald gimps just before he explodes, do you really care that much?\n\nWhat I enjopy most about Mad Max is just how immersive it is.  The world is so graphically captivating that it was just a real pleasure to exist there.  Sometimes I'm on the hunt for convoys, sometimes I'm lookin for a spot of fisticuffs, sometimes i'm doing insane jumps off ramps, sometimes i'm taking part in death races,  sometimes I'm just driving around to see what there is.  And with some many things to do and most of the gameworld unlocked after the tutorials section. you're free to explore at you're leisure and jus do whatever the hell you want.  If only this had multiplayer...\n\nIt’s not a perfect game by any means. The controls mess you up occasionally, you can only climb objects painted yellow, and there's a fair bit of grinding to do to upgrade your car.  The thing that really got my goat was when the game sends random enemies/storms at you at the worst moments.  Maybe I'm waiting to ambush a convoy and a lightning storm comes along and zaps me to cinders, or maybe I've just wrecked that convoy, no armour left, and a random bunch of war boys appear right behind me and smah me into oblivion.  Or how about the fact that all the bosses look and fight EXACTLY the same?\n\nBut all its faults are negligible in my opinion, as the experience of Mad Max as a whole was very enjoyable and immersing. Don’t like these big AAA console games?  Max ain’t gonna change your mind, sweetheart, but if you do like the Arkham/Mordor/Asscreed thing and fancy a wee bit of insane car combat in the mix, Mad Max is worth a try.","December 20, 2015","true","42.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not too strong of a story but it's Mad Max. Lots of violence and things blowing up. Badass cars and a well crafted post-apocalyptic wasteland.\n\nCouple of complaints I have is that the game gets repetetive, going from territory to territory scavenging scraps and collectibles, clearing out camps of baddies yet I couldn't stop playing. I also ran into bugs once in a while like clipping through objects or character body parts dissapearing and mines in the minefield not showing up properly. Coincidentally this game was made by Avalanche, same developer that made Just Cause 3 and somehow this game didn't turn out to be a buggy mess like that one but I digress.\n\nThe things I liked were the cars, specifically the Magnum Opus, the pinnacle of badassery. The wasteland itself could be quite beautiful and pretty to look at too during certain hours of the in-game day. The flow of combat is pretty simple and looks great when chaining combos and counters together. You get a sidekick named Chumbucket who's just the best lil hunchback sidekick ever.\n\nI had a lot of fun with it and would definately recommend it to strangers and my friends if they like driving and action games.","January 1","true","72.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

No idea why gamespot gave it 6/10 and polygon gave it 5.5 . The only site ive seen to do justice to this game is IGN with a solid 8.4 rating which i totally agree with.

Even though, you may sometimes get bord of collecting scrap at various scavanging locations,if you stop for 10 minutes, you will definately feel the need to start back playing this game. Its addicting!\n\nCons:\n- it just glitched on me twice and i ending up spawning somewhere else when i died, it fixed itself after i completed the mission and probably will be updated very soon.\n-nothing else\n\nTLDR: BUY IT, you wont be dissapointed\n\n","January 2","true","53.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/234140/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nReleased only a few months after the movie franchise reboot "Mad Max: Fury Road", Mad Max isn't just another one of those movie-adaptation video games to follow the same background and story, but instead it takes inspiration from the entire movie franchise to create a unique experience, as the game is more like prequel to Fury Road, introducing you to the world of Max Mad without the need for any prior knowledge about the series. Mad Max aims for a story about a pointless existence of murder and regret, which does have its moments in situations where your actions will end up messing up other people's lives as well as your own, but just like many other games of its kind the stories that will stay with you afterwards are the ones you make yourself on the road to the finale. The story follows Max, who is once again left with nothing after Scabrous Scrotus took his car, on his journey for revenge accompanied by Chumbucket, a lonely blackfinger whose only goal is to build to ultimate ride. Along this journey you will meet all different kinds of insane people, starting with the Stronghold leaders, which will give you different side quests to complete across the wasteland and ending with all the stranger encounters that will sometimes give you scrap as a token of their gratitude for your fight against Lord Scrotus or useful information to help you take over a camp, such as the location of a secret entrance or different weaknesses in the structure that you can take advantage of. The story missions are only a small part of what Mad Max has to offer, as there are plenty of things to distract you along the way and on that side of things, the game gives you plenty of things to do to spice up your adventures, with camps to take over, scavenging locations to complete and many more; the order in which you complete those is totally up to you and completing different activities along the way is what makes Mad Max an enjoyable experience, even when it does come with its flaws.\nRating: 9\n\nGameplay\nIf you have played some of the major open world games released in the past year such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, you will most likely find similarities in Mad Max's gameplay mechanics. On foot, the main combat element is brawling, as you will use simple attack and counter attack movements to defeat various types of enemies along the way, as the only weapon in your arsenal while on foot is your loyal shotgun, which does have limited ammo, so using it carefully between punches to defeat a more dangerous enemy approaching you is key. Driving your Magnum Opus things change, as the ultimate goal is upgrading your car to make it the best ride across the wastelands, as you will unlock new car bodies, engines, suspensions and many more customizable elements; with that being said, your Magnum Opus is equipped with a Harpoon that can be used to drag and pull different objects or structures, as well as a Thunderpoon and Side Burners. In addition to the weapons that can be attached to the Magnum Opus, the car itself can be used as a weapon, as different upgrades such as Boarder Spikes, Armour or Boost will come in handy if you want to be more aggressive and slam into other vehicles. While the main missions will give you an idea of how harsh the world of Mad Max is and introduce you to different elements of the game, the best way to experience what Mad Max has to offer is by going out to explore the different events and locations on your own, as there are numerous races to complete, camps to take over and scavenging locations filled with scrap and upgrade parts for your projects in the Strongholds. As large in scale as it is, Mad Max feels really limited when it comes to movement freedom, as you will often head for a cliff that looks easy to reach only to find out that there is no way for you to get there, as the movement mechanic only allows you to climb marked locations. On top of that, the game does come with the occasional bugs and glitches, but those are minor enough not to influence your experience too much.\nRating; 8\n\nGraphics\nFor a deserted wasteland, the world of Mad Max is quite beautiful in its own gloomy way, with detailed locations and memorable places; contributing to that world are the insane characters you will meet along the way, each with its unique personality and level of madness. The weather effects have a significant impact on the world, as nights will make the desert look even more lonely and storms will reduce the visibility to a point where looking ahead of you will become your main objective. Animations can be a bit clunky at times and there are some texture popping issues, the number of them varying from one platform to another, but those are only minor issues that barely distract you from the massive world that lies ahead of you.\nRating: 8\n\nAudio\nBren Foster is the voice of Max and does a great job narrating every dramatic moment of Max's adventures, accompanied by other noted actors such as Travis Willingham voicing Lord Scrotus and Jason Spisak providing the voice of Chumbucket. The sound effects are okay and even though they can feel a bit repetitive at times, there is enough variety in action to make sounds feel distinct and take you on an emotional ride from one dramatic moment to the next one and straight back into the chaotic action afterwards.\nRating: 8.5\n\nExtras\nYou can probably finish the story within 15 hours if you go straight forward from one mission to the next one and complete only what is necessary, but with so many things around you that will probably not be the case, so with all the races, camps and locations to explore you can easily spend 50 hours with Mad Max, add even more if you're willing to complete every challenge.\nRating: 9.5\n\nVerdict\nMad Max is an excellent open world adventure no matter if you're a fan of the movies or not, as the game does a great job introducing you to the world of the franchise and tell you an interesting story without sacrificing too much on the fun, chaotic gameplay that will keep you hooked for hours. If you want a game to keep you preoccupied for a long period of time, Mad Max is definitely a must try as it provides more than enough content and variety to entertaining you for a couple of days.\nRating Overall: 8.6\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Mad Max at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=371","December 24, 2015","true","57.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Maybe I'm waiting to ambush a convoy and a lightning storm comes along and zaps me to cinders, or maybe I've just wrecked that convoy, no armour left, and a random bunch of war boys appear right behind me and smah me into oblivion.  Or how about the fact that all the bosses look and fight EXACTLY the same?\n\nBut all its faults are negligible in my opinion, as the experience of Mad Max as a whole was very enjoyable and immersing. Don’t like these big AAA console games?  Max ain’t gonna change your mind, sweetheart, but if you do like the Arkham/Mordor/Asscreed thing and fancy a wee bit of insane car combat in the mix, Mad Max is worth a try.","December 20, 2015","true","42.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/warblingdeltoid/recommended/234140/","warblingdeltoid","Tom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/warblingdeltoid/","374 products in account","Mad Max\nMad Max is loosely based on the world built up in the Mad Max: Fury Road movie. There is Scrotus (Immortan Joe's son) and his hordes. There are Buzzards and there is also the Roadkill faction. Each faction is uniquely identifiable by their garb and veichles of choice. This is one of the places the game falls flat though. Each faction whilst looking and sounding different are basically the same sorts of people you'll fight but reskins of each other. No faction has a unique fighting style.\n\nThis lazy design choice also filters into the bosses, where every Top Dog mini boss has exactly the same fighting style despite "intel" saying they each have specific weaknesses and such. This is a let down because the mini bosses having their own unique fighting styles and designs would've improved immersion in the game. The game is also very easy, you can block your way through most fights and there's hardly any times you'll find yourself in trouble.\n\nWhere the game excels though is exploring the land presented to you in the game. Despite it mostly being nothing but sand each area has its own style and helps makes the drives throughout this post apocolyptic wasteland less of a bore. Whether it's driving through sulfur pits, garbage mountains, decrepit motorways or canyons each location is fresh and encourages you to dive around.\n\nEach location typically has the same amount to do in it. So 2 minefields to clear, a few scarerows to rip down, snipers to remove and camps to raid. This sounds dull and can get tedious at time I do admit, but I was having a blast 90% of the time. Especially when sieging the camps, most of them are pretty different from each other in terms of aesthetics so it doesn't get boring to explore and it gives you incentive to fully scout out every crevice of the camps for scrap and insignia signs to destory.\n\nEach major non enemy leader who hands out missions will own a stronghold. Each stronghold will have projects for you to do (basically mini fetch quests). The projects at each stronghold give bonuses and change the aesthetic of the stronghold too. At first the stronghold will be run down but with each project you do, it'll not only give you a bonus such as refueling your car or rearming you with fresh ammo but it'll transform the look of the stronghold from rundown slum to a place which is relatively nice to live in. It's nice to see your actions having a profound effect on the people living there.\n\nThe sound design for this game is excellent, with thumping engines, ear shattering explosions and cool australian accents. It almost never lets you down, they've really excelled here. My only complaint is the NPCs dotted around the map you can talk to, they sound as if they got someone off the street to do a fake accent and babble some rubbish. Only part of the audio that's a let down. These NPCs are visually a letdown too because they all look very similar so the developers obviously didn't put too much effort into them.\n\nThe story isn't very compelling, but then again Mad Max isn't famous for excellent story telling. It's mediocre, except my main problem with it is that it ends too early. Just as the story missions start to get interesting the game ends abruptly. It took me 20-30 minutes to finish Act 5.\n\nMax can have his items and car upgraded and his skills unlocked via Scrap. You can find Scrap all over the world, on dead bodies, in forts and in scavenging locations. The upgrading system is very satisfying and you can definitely see yourself and your car progress in strength and capability. You can do up your car however you want, so you can have a fast but fragile car or a slow but tooled to the nines car and all inbetween. The choice is yours!\n\n\nIn conclusion:\n+ Lots to do\n+ Lots of places to explore\n+ Art / Sound design is fantastic\n+ Car combat is fun\n+ Upgrading your car is very satisfying\n\n- Very easy foot combat\n- Car combat can get tedious\n- Story ends abruptly\n- Mini bosses all have the same fighting patterns\n- Factions don't have unique combat moves\n\nIn conclusion Mad Max is a fun open world game with nice enviroments to explore. It will get repetitive at times, which can be dull for a lot of people. It's easy but don't let that put you off. This is a great game to buy.","October 25, 2015","true","43.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Mad Max has a lot of entertaining and fun aspects, but also contains a lot of boring and repetitive actions.  The story is decent, the controls are good, the graphics are very beautiful, and the environment is very well done.  The gameplay is rather simple, and even without upgrading your character's abilities or gear you can do very well in a fight with minimal experience, but the true enjoyment of this game does not occur on foot, but in your car.  With your trusty mechanic and harpoon shooter in the back, you take the wheel and fight head to head against other drivers, often with tricks up their sleeves.  The car combat is very fun, and it's worth upgrading your ride to handle some of the difficult challenges that await you in the wasteland.  Overall I would recommend it if you can find it for less than $25, but I would not say that it is worth much more than that unless you enjoy exploring a vast and open wasteland picking up scrap metal for hours on end.  A scavenging location can yield anywhere from 2 pieces of scrap to 50, but you need thousands of scrap to get a few of the upgrades for your car, and that takes a lot of time to grind out.\n\nTLDR: Overall, a good game, but be prepared for a lot of grinding if you want 100% completion on it.\n7.5/10","September 23, 2015","true","43.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I keep seeing all the reviews that rant and rave but I just can't say that this game is worth it. Its basically a copy and paste of shadows of mordor which I really liked so I assumed I would like this, but its god aweful. The beginning of the game makes you think you have all these options to pick but you start off only unlocking things because you need them in the story so it doesnt really feel like you are in control of getting upgrades and modifying your car for a bit. This happens later though and makes the game more fun. However, EVERYTHING you do feels super grindy. Go here fight the same guys, pick stuff up, go here and talk to this person, rinse and repeat. Again, shadows of mordor was basically the same thing but for some reason I liked it much better compared to this game. Also, everything you do feels super drawn out and takes forever to do. Maybe its supposed to be that way but every thing from loading screens, to even the movement of max in how if you accidentally aimed wrong while walking toward something like a ladder and or pressed the action button too soon, you had to re-adjust and try again. Fighting in the car gets old quick as sometimes you can feel helpless in your attempts to outrun or fight off even 2 or 3 cars. Next is the upgrades; if youre like me, you try and collect things and get upgrades before doing all of the main quests. What bugs me is that you dont even get the big v8 engine until  theres only like 2 main quests left, which leaves me sad because once I get the engine, I have nothing left to do.\n\nLastly, and for whatever reason I think Im one of the few people this has happened to; this game is buggy as ♥♥♥♥. My sound cuts out A LOT for different things. Whether its the engine or dialogue, or even general sound effects. And when this happens, my game stops loading the landscape so im left with weird piles of sand and ground that I can drive into and through. And sometimes the ground gives out and my car falls through the map. In addition, whenever this happens, I can't even fix it by going to the main menu or fast traveling because the game freezes when I try either of those options. So then I basically have to restart the game and watch the intro videos which arent that long but start to take forever once I have restarted the game like 4 times in 45 minutes of play.\n\nSo like I said, I really tried to like this game. I REALLY did; but sadly, I ♥♥♥♥in hate it. However, I don't neccesarily think the game doesnt deserve praise. People should still play it as it is pretty fun.","September 24, 2015","true","18.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You'll like it or hate it. The game is loosely based on the recent Fury Road movie though the story and characters arent. (The Max in the game isnt modelled or voiced by Tom Hardy either). The game starts with Max being attacked by the warlord of Gastown, Scrotus, who steals Maxs Inteceptor and leaves him for dead. Max finds a hunchback mechanic called Chumbucket who helps Max to build a new car to get back at Scrotus. The Magnum Opus.\n\nGood points:\n-The Wasteland of the game and all the bizarre characters who inhabit it really capture the look and feel of the recent movie. The map is huge and your let loose to try and attack Scrotus' camps and structures to weaken his influence over the Wasteland.\n- The Magnum Opus can be customized with different weapons like flamethrowers or a ramming grill for example as well as improving things like wheels and engine. Which is great because the Magnum Opus feels more like your own vehicle than some generic vehicle. The vehicle combat in game is a lot of fun too.\n-The graphics in this game are great though you'll need a powerful rig to get them at their max. (No pun intended)\n\nBad points:\n- This game has a lot of collectibles and you'll spend a lot of time gathering scrap to improve the Magnum Opus and Max.   This gets very repetitive and while i didnt mind it so much at first i was sick of it towards the end. Unfortunately since you need certain upgrades for some of the story missions it'sunavoidable to some extant.\n- The combat is similar to that of other WB games like the Arkham series and Shadow of Mordor. It does feel a bit too easy at times as it's just one button to attack and another to counter. There isnt much enemy variety either.The one thing i liked about the combat was how visceral and real it looks. Rather than fancy acrobatics or martial arts the fights look more like a pub brawl and just as brutal.\n\nWhile some might see the freedom to explore as you will with occasional story mission as a plus, i felt the game could have done with more structure as it would have helped it avoid becoming a repetitive experience. I have decided to recommend it because i did really enjoy the game for the first 15-20 hours and it still is a decent game overall. However if you cant stand loads of collectables and repetitive gameplay this might not be for you.","September 26, 2015","true","44.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Other times, the pause menu's back button will continue to be drawn over gameplay, which can be fixed by clicking it. Other than that, the game runs flawlessly.\n\nThe game looks somewhat difficult to mod, with all data files being stored in proprietary archives.

Its a wasteland), car chasing, scavenging (yep, maggots are back on the menu boys), car upgrading and brutal fighting (batman fighting gameplay) this game is for you. Honestly, the way car reacts on the sand, the sound of the engines, everything is wonderful. The way the scenery changes inside a sandstorm, is something that you have never encountered before. In general what do you do in the game now (in case you wonder)\n\n1) you scavenge small camps and abandoned vehicles like ships (i guess there was a sea over there) and you also find relics of another time that reminds you how it was once, and they really add to the feeling\n2)Destroy larger camps with enemies.\n3)Destroy big camps where you have to beat the local boss of the area\n4)participate in death races (while in open world, you can steal other cars in order to use them in these races)\n5)Help helpless people by giving them water, in exchange for information\n6) as you cross the wasteland, random gangs will attack you, or an enemy convoy will pass, that you could attack and destroy in order to gain materials and  parts.\n7) Game has soft borders. Means that there isn't any invinsible wall that will tell you "its over". Want to drive into nothingness? Go ahead. More wasteland for you. You might find something useful, or you can die there. And yes, you can find something useful outside of the map. Well done Avalanche!\n8)I almost forgot. Enemies in cars are not stupid. If they see they loose, they will run away.

The story, the characters, the environments, the customisation all on point. For a movie-game adaptation this is the best I've experienced so far. I haven't seen any Mad Max films but I picked this game up from {LINK REMOVED}♥♥♥.com for $17 AUD(roughly $12 USD) and blasted through it. I pretty much played it non-stop for 60+ hours over the past 4 or 5 days and I've never enjoyed wasting my spare time on a video game more than this beside MGS V: TTP(Which I no-life'd for 120 hours over 3 weeks).\n\nPoints of reference:\nMagnum Opus - Car\nWar Boys - Enemies\nScrotus - Main antagonist\nChumbucket(Chum) - Companion\n\n\nOverview\n\nYou are left for dead by Scrotus and he's has taken your Interceptor. Max is on a quest to rebuild a car capable of crossing The Plains of Silence.\n\nAt the beginning of the game you are buddied with a dog which I'll go over more later, and hunchback called Chumbucket which I'll also go over later. Max is on a quest to rebuild a car capable of crossing The Plains of Silence. Throughout the game Max and Chum build a new car; The Magnum Opus and upgrade it for attack, defense and speed. The game is set in 5 regions, 4 of which have strongholds which can be upgraded and used as fast travel points. The 4 regions with strongholds have a threat level and by doing an assortment of activities like taking over enemy strongholds, destroying territory markers and clearing minefields you will lower the threat level thus lowering the War Boy presence (The dog is used to find the land mines in the minefields). The strongholds each have a leader who gives you side missions. You'll also be able to upgrade Max with new combat abilities, attire and even hairstyles. The Magnum Opus can be upgraded with 5 different body types and various armaments and defenses like flame throwers, seeking rockets and a harpoon launcher. Of course with this game heavily revolving around Max's car, there are racing activities to do across the map called Death Runs. The Death Runs have a variety of different types of races such as normal races, timebomb races Chumbucket is with you throughout the entire game and stays in the car. His main purpose is to repair the car and initiate conversation with Max so driving around doesn't seem empty. He's a great character and fits well into the story.\n\nCombat System\n\nTo be honest I didn't know what to expect from this game. Warner Bros. has reused the combat systems from the Batman Arkham games and Shadow of Mordor, games which I both enjoyed heavily(besides SoM which I haven't started yet). I think the combat system works really well for a game like Mad Max but at times it just felt like a big chore having to constantly press X(LMB) to attatck and Y(RMB) to counter all the time. Around camps and loot locations where you'll fight War Boys, there are often temporary weapon pick ups that break after a few hits or will drop when you enter a vehicle. I find using a game pad more comfortable for a games like this, especially since the majority of gameplay is made up of CQC and driving.\n\nConclusion\n\nNow I'm not a long-time Mad Max film guy but I have been meaning to go watch Mad Max: Fury Road but I hadn't had time when the movie was in cinemas. I think the narrative is well written and kept me interested throughout the game. I became distracted from the main story for a while, grinding loot locations and collecting scrap metal  as scrap metal which is the games currency. The customisation of Max and the Magnum Opus was very diverse, as well as the enemies and enemy vehicles. Characters were well voiced and unique as well a balanced level of Australian and American accents. Overall I'd rate this game a 9.5 out of 10 and woould definitely recommend it to anyone, Mad Max fan or no.","January 14","true","66.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Graphics are great, and the game is ♥♥♥♥ easy to run.   I got this game during the winter sale in order to hold me off form playing Just Casue 3 until I upgraded my PC more to run it, and I absolutely love it.  Highly reccomend this game to fans of the Mad Max series or someone just looking for a great open world game.\n\nPros:\n-Great Story mode, decently long\n-Weapon mechanics on cars\n-Wide variety of enemies\n-Driving is a breeze\n-Large map with different terrains suited for different vehicles\n-Beautiful graphics and surprisingly easy to run\n-Extremely large variety of customization for cars and Max\n-Camps require strategy to infiltrate and defeat\n-This game is heaven for those who like to hoard items\n\nCons-\n-"Top Dogs" and other bosses insanely easy to defeat\n-Random encounters with enemy drivers can get annoying if you're trying to traverse long distances\n-Fighting is a bit too mindless since you mainly use two buttons to attack and parry\n-F*CKING SANDSTORMS\n\nTHE VERDICT:\nI loved this game.  It runs flawlessly and there is no feeling of being drowned in DLC to get the most out of Mad Max.. very surprising seeing that this was made by the same company that made Arkham Knight for PC.  Overall I am very impressed.  This game has made me want to get into the Mad Max movies, considering I only watched Fury Road.  I rate this game a 95/100.","January 12","true","149.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/preteenmeme/recommended/234140/","preteenmeme","bambles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/preteenmeme/","452 products in account","This game blew me away. The story, the characters, the environments, the customisation all on point. For a movie-game adaptation this is the best I've experienced so far. I haven't seen any Mad Max films but I picked this game up from {LINK REMOVED}♥♥♥.com for $17 AUD(roughly $12 USD) and blasted through it. I pretty much played it non-stop for 60+ hours over the past 4 or 5 days and I've never enjoyed wasting my spare time on a video game more than this beside MGS V: TTP(Which I no-life'd for 120 hours over 3 weeks).\n\nPoints of reference:\nMagnum Opus - Car\nWar Boys - Enemies\nScrotus - Main antagonist\nChumbucket(Chum) - Companion\n\n\nOverview\n\nYou are left for dead by Scrotus and he's has taken your Interceptor. Max is on a quest to rebuild a car capable of crossing The Plains of Silence.\n\nAt the beginning of the game you are buddied with a dog which I'll go over more later, and hunchback called Chumbucket which I'll also go over later. Max is on a quest to rebuild a car capable of crossing The Plains of Silence. Throughout the game Max and Chum build a new car; The Magnum Opus and upgrade it for attack, defense and speed. The game is set in 5 regions, 4 of which have strongholds which can be upgraded and used as fast travel points. The 4 regions with strongholds have a threat level and by doing an assortment of activities like taking over enemy strongholds, destroying territory markers and clearing minefields you will lower the threat level thus lowering the War Boy presence (The dog is used to find the land mines in the minefields). The strongholds each have a leader who gives you side missions. You'll also be able to upgrade Max with new combat abilities, attire and even hairstyles. The Magnum Opus can be upgraded with 5 different body types and various armaments and defenses like flame throwers, seeking rockets and a harpoon launcher. Of course with this game heavily revolving around Max's car, there are racing activities to do across the map called Death Runs. The Death Runs have a variety of different types of races such as normal races, timebomb races Chumbucket is with you throughout the entire game and stays in the car. His main purpose is to repair the car and initiate conversation with Max so driving around doesn't seem empty. He's a great character and fits well into the story.\n\nCombat System\n\nTo be honest I didn't know what to expect from this game. Warner Bros. has reused the combat systems from the Batman Arkham games and Shadow of Mordor, games which I both enjoyed heavily(besides SoM which I haven't started yet). I think the combat system works really well for a game like Mad Max but at times it just felt like a big chore having to constantly press X(LMB) to attatck and Y(RMB) to counter all the time. Around camps and loot locations where you'll fight War Boys, there are often temporary weapon pick ups that break after a few hits or will drop when you enter a vehicle. I find using a game pad more comfortable for a games like this, especially since the majority of gameplay is made up of CQC and driving.\n\nConclusion\n\nNow I'm not a long-time Mad Max film guy but I have been meaning to go watch Mad Max: Fury Road but I hadn't had time when the movie was in cinemas. I think the narrative is well written and kept me interested throughout the game. I became distracted from the main story for a while, grinding loot locations and collecting scrap metal  as scrap metal which is the games currency. The customisation of Max and the Magnum Opus was very diverse, as well as the enemies and enemy vehicles. Characters were well voiced and unique as well a balanced level of Australian and American accents. Overall I'd rate this game a 9.5 out of 10 and woould definitely recommend it to anyone, Mad Max fan or no.","January 14","true","66.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is really well done and resembles the same atmosphere felt in the film.\n\nThe characters are all fantastic and the voice acting is really one of the best I've ever seen in a video game.\n\nPros:\n1. Probably the most well optimised game I've played ever.\n2. Excellent setting, there's lots of post-apocalyptic games but none that focus on cars and car modifcations to the extent that Mad Max does.\n3. Upgrade system is truly wide an deep. Not only do you have different tiers of unlocks for everything on your car but also for Max himself. There are also some hidden unlocks provided after completion of the story that were a very nice touch.\n4. Combat system is basic but very satisfying with the upgrades you can give Max to give him more of an edge while fighting.\n5. Open world do as you like. You can in theory do a bunch of challenges that gets Max to highest rank before completing the majority of the story and stronghold missions. This leaves you with a very easy path to finishing the game though.\n\nCons:\n1. The game can get a little repetitive with scavenging from camps, finishing top dogs, oil camps and stank gum but these things are ofset by the long term rewards you get for completing the areas.\n2. Stronghold missions tended to be a lot less fun and interesting than the story missions. Sometimes story missions unlock upgrades where you already have the next tier of upgrade.\n3. Once you finish the game if you're still trying to finish up the upgrades to your V8 (final cost for all the V8s is well into > 10000 scrap) scrap tends to be harder to comeby in larger amounts. I also found that mobile scrap transports are very rare in the same limiting your ability to find them on the roads.\n\nAll in all I loved Mad Max from start to finish. It doesn't have any annoying second launcher or DRM, you have the option to get WBPlay (ie its not forced down your throat) and overall is a well rounded game.","January 16","true","56.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WickedMouse/recommended/234140/","WickedMouse","Wicked Mouse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WickedMouse/","110 products in account","My name's Max...Fans of the old and new movies alike will instantly recognise the setting and (art)style, largely copied from the third movie (Fury Road). You play the protagonist Mad Rockatansky, or "Mad Max", in a post-apocalyptic wasteland at some former coast of Australia, looking for his homeland which he mysteriously calls "the Plains of Silence". Already at the start of the game, in the intro, he gets robbed of his V8 car "Interceptor" and posessions and over the coarse of the game he tries to get back his car (or build a new one as he soon discovers), avenge the man responsible (Scabrous Scrotus) to then continue his journey. On his way he encounters the many War Boys of Scabrous Scrotus, and a fellow war lord Stank Gum with his War Boys, and also some allies whos help he can use all too well.\n\nA beautiful desertThe graphics in this game are pretty well done and optimised. Although of course this game is not full of lush bushes, animals and other stuff that can burden your graphics card a lot, it still feels like a beautiful vast outstretching desert full of artifacts of a past history that runs really well and smooth. Scattered around the landscape you find, next to rock formations and tire tracks, the remnants of a lost world: rusty shipwrecks, former oil drill platforms, crumbled bridges, ruins of factory buildings, docksides, harbour cranes, so on and so forth, reminding of a life long gone where there was still plenty of water and food to go around. Collectibles scattered throughout the world will hint you to it and what might have happened.\n\nIt's a fun driveSo how does it play? After meeting your first few characters you find yourself quickly driving around a LOT in your newly acquired ride looking for scrap, the main currency in the game. Scrap is used to upgrade your car, lovingly called the 'Magnum Opus' by Chumbucket whom you meet at the start of the game and likes to express everything in a religious but car related fashion, and scrap is used to unlock some abilities and gear on Max. By completing activities like achievements, do x times this or x times that, or races you will earn Griffa tokens. These can be spent when you visit Griffa to upgrade some perks. These perks will add extra scrap ontop of what you pick up, or makes you consume less fuel, et cetera.\n\nOf combat in this game are two kinds: on foot and in the car. That's right, car combat! Early in the game Chumbucket will fabricate a harpoon for you on the car that enables you to rip off doors, tires, bumpers or snatch the driver right from his seat! Despite the limited tools you get for the car to use, car combat in this game is the most fun. Chasing down Scrotus' convoys going high speed, picking off cars left and right watching them tumble and turn into big balls of fire (Michael Bay would approve!) feels exhilarating!\n\nOn foot the combat is much the same like the Batman games, for those familiar with it. Max can pick up a few weapons but they always have a (very) limited lifespan. This can be elongated by the perks at Griffa, but you'll generally be fighting with your fists. Even the little shivs Max carries can only be used once for a finisher and not always be looted back from the corpses. Max also carries a shotgun, but the ammo is rather limited, even with all upgrades unlocked. All-in-all the combat in the beginning feels powerful, it feels as if more could have been done to make it more interesting and less repetitive in the long run. Every boss fight of the Top Dogs in the world is almost completely the same and requires no imagination. Once you figured out one, you know how to beat them all. Such a pity!\n\nStory wise this game is as dry as the world it plays in and as shallow as the water collectors. There is very little character development, of either Max or anyone he encounters. Then again, Max is a rather selfish man with little empathy for others. At least that's what he wants to make himself believe. Griffa, the fella Max visits to upgrade his perks every now and then, sometimes puts question marks at his deeds to make him rethink, but that's about all the hints Max (and the player) gets.\n\nTL;DRThe game is a good looker, runs very well, and fun to play if you like to drive an aweful lot through miles and miles of desert land in a world fueled by the atmosphere from Mad Max: Fury Road. Car combat is most fun, combat on foot is a little too familiar and not much depth. Story is very short and paper thin I'd say, compared to games like Witcher 3. If you like the car bit, it can be worth your money. If you seek something full of story and rich hand-to-hand combat, you will be disappointed.","February 3","true","66.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A gazillion graphical settings and in has rock solid frame times no stuttering and great performance at 4k. It's a shame this game came out on the same day of MGS V. It deserves much more attention that it will get.\n\nWill update once I am several hours into the game.\n\nEDITED: After 30 h of gameplay I can safely say that I am still really enjoying the game. Upgrading the cars is fun. The gameplay mechanics, while simple, do their job. The atmosphere is pure Mad Max.

Before you take these camps, it is ideal to scout out their defensive features, such as snipers or flame thrower traps. You do this by standing nearby, somewhere out of sight, with your binoculars which will mark these defensive features for you (much like in far cry 3, except it does not mark individual enemies). Each of these camps also has a myriad of minor objectives to complete, such as finding all the scrap, historical relics, or whatever other random things are scattered around the camp, or destroying insignias. Once you do this, you get a nice shiny 100% on that camp.\n\nThe melee combat is fairly fun, though a bit more weighty than some might like. However, it is the same system as assasins creed, or the batman games. You will spam (light attacks) or hold (heavy attacks) the x button, and press the y button to parry (ideally at the right time, so you have a better counter). Some attacks can't be parried, so you will have to roll out of the way.\n\nThe driving itself (aside from boosts, weapons, and other such things, of course) is fairly similar to GTA V's as far as weight goes. The vehicle combat is also pretty fun, with a fairly large variety of enemies and tools at your disposal.\n\nThere are also a few survival aspects, such as a canteen you want to keep filled with water so that you can heal (you don't regenerate health), or cars burning gasoline (which can be scavenged at many places on the map).\n\n\nOverall, I found it to be very fun for the first few hours. However, if you have played a lot of Assasin's Creed, or any of the Batman games, the melee system may be a bit more dull for you. If you have played either, I'd suggest picking it up on a sale, as the world of Mad Max is still very fun to drive around in and experience. If you like vehicle combat in games, or generally just driving around and exploring the map, this is definitely worth considering.","September 10, 2015","true","29.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Many people have compared to the batman games and after playing them would agree the fist fights are very similar, however max has much more. So…\n\nPros; Great cinematic graphics loved the lens flair and some of the scenery shots you can take. A bit of base building and stranger. Massive open world with plenty to do and enough diversity that you don’t feel like to you have to do a section of the game you hate. Nice story although very Mad Max with very little deep concept it had nice array of characters to meet.\n\nCons; Game can be a grind at some points especially when trying to progress the story as not grinding can make some missions very hard (could be a pro if you like that kind of thing). Some of the experience elements I thought were wasted especially if you can bypass them in other ways (ammo, water, fuel).\n\nOverall though I would say a good game and was a bargain in the last winter sale.\n","January 18","true","39.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I don't really think that at 8 hours in, I should write a comprehensive review of the game and so consider that before you read.\n\nBut I have a few things to say and so here they are.\n\nThe intro to the game is wonderful, very well done. A lot better than Witcher 3 and most games that have been released in the last year. Very artsy, very well done.\n\nThe game itself, the story, I like it. I'm not a big fan of the Mad Max series. I saw the first film, that is it. But I like the characters, the narrative, the story.\n\nThe thing I like best about the game is that for me, this is the first game that actually really looks great in 4K. I mean the difference between 1080 and 4K in this game is very dramatic and I am playing it in 4K with a single  GTX970 and getting 60-70 FPS solid. The game is very well optimized. I get 144 FPS solid in the game with 970 SLI.\n\nOnly a couple of negatives to report. My Logitech conroller won't work in the game, and this seems to not be an isolated problem. The other issue is that there is no walk/run toggle in the game. You pretty much cannot walk.\n\n4 out of 5, will keep playing and come back and update the review.","September 5, 2015","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Maybe you've read other reviews that say it's the most open world open world action adventure action adventure trope game. Yes, it's open world, yes, it's an action adventure game, but let me ask those reviewers one thing? How else would you have preferred a Mad Max game? The primary focus in Mad Max is vehicular combat across the vast open terrain of the wasteland. Yes, Max has free flow combat similar to other WB published games in the past few years, but he isn't Batman or the guy from Shadow of Mordor. Max is, to an extent, a regular ol' dude with some emotional issues pertaining to his past and the fact that he is a shell of his former self. Point is, Avalanche made the Mad Max game that Mad Max fans had always wanted; so f * * k the reviewers that say the game is repetitive or lacking. Have they even seen a Mad Max film? The stories aren't exactly as complex as Metal Gear Solid, which I think is another reason why Mad Max is being overlooked, the fact that MGSV came out the same day. The Mad Max stories are rather simple with an even simpler context, global economic crisises and nuclear warfare.\n\nNow that I got my little rant out of the way, I can actually talk about the game. Max is driving his beloved Interceptor through the Wasteland, trying to reach the Plains of Silence in hopes of finding a more civilized society. Unfortunately, Scaborous Scrotus, son of Immortan Joe, succeeds in vehicular combat with his mighty Land Mower and Max is forced to jump out, ending up fighting Scrotus himself. After apparently killing Scrotus, Max finds himself somewhere unknown and befriends Scrotus' dog. Together, they find Chumbucket, a hunchback mechanic. This is where the story really takes off as Chum and Max plot to build a Magnum Opus, a car better, stronger, and superior in each way to the Interceptor. Chum and Max travel throughout the Wasteland, assisting faction leaders and progressing throughout the story to upgrade car parts and Max's own gear. The story is actually more interesting than just that, but I don't wanna spoil it.\n\nGameplay, as noted in my rant earlier, is similar to recent action adventure games. Besides comparing it to recent WB games, I could also compare it to Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, as you invade camps (Forts) and complete a primary objective in order to take control of it where your allies will then be there. Also the strongholds where you meet various "community" leaders. You do favors for these leaders (i.e. side missions that actually have plot) and are then able to upgrade these strongholds by collecting project parts at various scavenging locations or camps scattered throughout the wasteland. These locations could be massive forts or hidden caves, or underground passages below a hatch. There is so much to do in this game, it can actually be overwhelming. Anyway, I wanna focus on the vehicular combat gameplay, I shouldn't have to explain what action adventure is. Vehicular combat is pretty rare in modern games, so having vehicle combat in Mad Max was astounding. You can use side burners, t-bone or rail cars head on, use a harpoon to rip off doors and tires and bumpers, or the thunderpoon to blow stuff up. And then the beloved shotgun, which can be used for a variety of things while driving. Not to mention that much of this will be occurring at high speeds. Basically, Avalanced did a splendid job with the vehicular combat.\n\nGraphics; jeez. I could tell you about how great and stunning the graphics are, because they are. But I won't bore you with that, instead, I just want to mention that this game is clearly set sometime after Thunderdome as there is sand practically everywhere. In the first two films, we got to see a side of Australia comparable to Arizona where there was a lot of small cacti life and dry ground. But man, Thunderdome really struck home field with the sand. And so does this game. The sand is awesome. Your tires leave imprints, as do your feet, whether driving or running along, on top of it. The vibrant skies are perfect. Graphics.\n\nLet me also just add that there are side quests in this game that are not just fetch quests. They might seem menial and menial side quests have become a modern thing to complain about since I guess The Witcher 3 perfected the side quest formula. But here, in Mad Max, the side quests actually lead to upgrades and are integral to the character's leveling system. You'll get more griffa points which can be used to upgrade Max's stats. Plus several of the side quests actually have stories to them, as you'll learn with Hope and Glory who later become a main point to the main story.\n\nEnding on that, Mad Max turned out to be a great great game that will be overlooked at the end of the year due to being shadowed by the release of MGSV and not being Mad Max: Furty Road The Game. It's just Mad Max, a game. It's its own thing, and works well as its own thing (although it does lead well into Fury Road except for a few minor details).\n\n9.1/10","November 3, 2015","true","57.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It really doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table in terms of game-play and mechanics. It has a lot of grind to it for completionists.

The game runs incredibly smooth, and though it almost feels like a console game meant for being played with a controller, I found I preferred playing it with keyboard and mouse (I feel the same way about the Arkham games).\n\n8/10.

The best action post-apo game since "Rage".The game is great on so many levels. First of all it works great (nice optimalization) ! 60 FPS as a starting point gives smoothness especially needed in car chases (btw car mechanics are cool). Incredible vistas! They are rather minimalistic in details but this is a good thing. The feeling of isolation is palpable here. Also the different color moods are fantastic! Another good thing is hand to hand combat. It's got batman's formula and It's enjoyable. The story is ok with many cool looking characters but don't expect to much. The downside is too busy map. The core of the game is grinding for scrap but with two good mechanics like driving/combat you don't mind doing so.

OK looking graphics but runs very smoothly at 60fps with everything maxed. Xbox controller working well but I have not tried it with kb and mouse.\n\nThe map is huge, with lots to do but this may get a bit repetative as far as I can tell. It feels a bit like Shadow of Mordor and Assassin Creed with similar combat to the Arkham series of games, but with slightly different controls. Combat and driving flows well using controller and is easy to pick up and master.\n\nStory is interesting so far with plenty of upgrades and stuff to earn through gameplay. It looks quite like Rage but it has more emphasis on hand to hand and car combat. I imagine it will be a game that is easy to 100% but rather time consuming. As I said I think the side missions and collectibles could be tedious but I am enjoying it all so far.\n\nI paid £20 and I am very happy with my purchase.

I'm a big fan of post-apocalyptic games.\n\nPROS:\n+ Graphics.\n+ Optimization(seriously, it's sick. 60 FPS with everything on max, 1440p. GTX 970).\n+ Voice acting.\n+ Story(haven't got far at all yet, but I like what I've seen so far).\n+ Ground combat(I like this kind of combat system--aka Batman Arkham X combat style--, so if you don't this might be a con).\n+ Car combat\n\nCONS:\n- No real innovation(capturing/razing strongholds ala Ubisoft isn't anything new and is quite frankly rather boring. Same goes for flying up in the balloon to scout, although this gives quite the view which is great).\n- Car handlig(might be just me, but I don't like the slight delay between the pressing of the steering button and the actual steering of the car).\n- So far, no sniper rifle outside of the car(to use the sniper rifle, you gotta be in the back of the car. As I haven't finished the game yet, I might get a portable sniper rifle further in - although I suspect I won't).\n- Some potentially game breaking bugs(like having looted a place you need to loot later on in a quest, thus making looting that place again during questing impossible).\n\nIf you enjoy the Mad Max franchise, post-apocalyptic games or open-world games, you might find this fun. Thus far, I'm going to give this game 7/10.

The only thing that I can literally say bad about this game's performance is a couple glitches here and there (fell through the map once, car span wildly into the sky another time) that don't even happen that often, once every 8+ hours. As for the length of the game, it took me 24 hours of play time (23 hours, 53 minutes to be exact) to complete all of the story missions & lower the threat level for Jeet's territory to null. The game counts that to be around 40% of the game completed, I'm sure the rest being all of the scavenging locations and whatnot. This game will without a doubt last you more than 48 hours of playtime to 100% it. I picked this game up for $23, and to give a general summary of the purchase, was well god damn worth every penny. Never got bored of it through my three or four binge sessions, either, a nice touch. Only complaint really though is that the combat is basically mash X (or square, for PS controllers), press Y if you see an indicator to counter an attack, and for unavoidable attacks, lunge out of the way. A slight complaint, too, is that the controls are actually smoothed, an effect similar to mouse acceleration, unfortunately, I didn't find a setting to turn this behavior off. Fortunately, after the first hour or two, you will get used to it and you won't feel it thereafter.\n\nAs for the optimization (because it needs it's own paragraph): you can probably run this on a toaster at lowest settings, which really speaks something. My mediocre cards (2x R9 270x, 4GB VRAM, OC edition) can run this game at 60FPS+ with every single setting maxed out with vsync on. In comparison, I get ~60FPS in BF4 on low-medium settings. To summarize, this game is an absolutely optimized beast.\n\nCompletely would recommend this game, seen the movies or not.","September 9, 2015","true","38.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

Anything yellow can be interacted with - ladders, cramped entrances, climbable areas, etc.\nYou can fall a fair bit before you take any damage, but walk slowly if you jump from high up.\nYou can insta-die if you fall too far, but it's pretty forgiving.\nHealth can be regained by eating old dog food, or eating maggots from certain corpses. The main way you regain health is by drinking from your water canteen. The water canteen does not carry that much water but can be refilled from water-stills that refill regularly.\nUnlock the map by going up on a balloon where you must use your binoculars to mark stuff individually. I like this as it's more interactive than alternatives. If you missed something then putting away your bino's lets you look for stuff with a much wider field of vision. Once used, these ballon sites become fast travel points.\nAll locations have a visible checklist of stuff to collect - scrap, historic relics, ammo.\nMost locations on the map are simply for looting -scrap, ammo, fuel, water, collectable historical relics- but are still very varied, and mostly unique.\nEnemy camps can be liberated, but require you to clear perimeter defenses, kill defenders, and completing an objective (either killing enemies, or blowing up oil derricks/tanks).\nOnce liberated camps give you scrap ever few minutes.\nBeware of minefields - they can be cleared by using a special vehicle, and your dog.\nThere are storms in this game! These are terrifying -but sound and look wonderful!\nThey come in two types; Sandstorms that kill you by hitting you with debris, and Lightning-storms that kill you with scary lightning.\nStaying out in them is dangerous but let you find boxes of scrap. Outrunning them is impossible (but you can try!) but if you reach a liberated camp it ends immediately.\n\nProgression, and Upgrades\nScrap is the main currency of the game. Get it by looting dead enemies, destroying vehicles, and looting locations.\nScrap is used to upgrade your car and gear -including combat skills\nAllied Strongholds can be thought of as your bases. By completing side missions and finding certain project parts you can build things in them that do important things when completed - such as fully refuel your car, restore health, fill your canteen.

I'm a big fan of post-apocalyptic games.\n\nPROS:\n+ Graphics.\n+ Optimization(seriously, it's sick. 60 FPS with everything on max, 1440p. GTX 970).\n+ Voice acting.\n+ Story(haven't got far at all yet, but I like what I've seen so far).\n+ Ground combat(I like this kind of combat system--aka Batman Arkham X combat style--, so if you don't this might be a con).\n+ Car combat\n\nCONS:\n- No real innovation(capturing/razing strongholds ala Ubisoft isn't anything new and is quite frankly rather boring. Same goes for flying up in the balloon to scout, although this gives quite the view which is great).\n- Car handlig(might be just me, but I don't like the slight delay between the pressing of the steering button and the actual steering of the car).\n- So far, no sniper rifle outside of the car(to use the sniper rifle, you gotta be in the back of the car. As I haven't finished the game yet, I might get a portable sniper rifle further in - although I suspect I won't).\n- Some potentially game breaking bugs(like having looted a place you need to loot later on in a quest, thus making looting that place again during questing impossible).\n\nIf you enjoy the Mad Max franchise, post-apocalyptic games or open-world games, you might find this fun. Thus far, I'm going to give this game 7/10. I will probably update the review later on as I get further into the game, might add or remove some points or pros/cons.\n\nThanks for reading.","September 3, 2015","true","8.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Mad Max is a combination of driving and 3D beat-em up.  The action is over the top.  The story is not quite as involved as the aforementioned title but then again this is post-apocalyptic wasteland.  Such a place in reality would be large, dangerous, and empty.  Drama would be a luxury that no one trying to survive could afford.  In that sense, a sparse story fits the locale.  The place may be a large sandbox but the scenery is absolutely gorgeous.  In over 60 hrs of play I've only had two CTD's so the game is well coded.

Anything yellow can be interacted with - ladders, cramped entrances, climbable areas, etc.\nYou can fall a fair bit before you take any damage, but walk slowly if you jump from high up.\nYou can insta-die if you fall too far, but it's pretty forgiving.\nHealth can be regained by eating old dog food, or eating maggots from certain corpses. The main way you regain health is by drinking from your water canteen. The water canteen does not carry that much water but can be refilled from water-stills that refill regularly.\nUnlock the map by going up on a balloon where you must use your binoculars to mark stuff individually. I like this as it's more interactive than alternatives. If you missed something then putting away your bino's lets you look for stuff with a much wider field of vision. Once used, these ballon sites become fast travel points.\nAll locations have a visible checklist of stuff to collect - scrap, historic relics, ammo.\nMost locations on the map are simply for looting -scrap, ammo, fuel, water, collectable historical relics- but are still very varied, and mostly unique.\nEnemy camps can be liberated, but require you to clear perimeter defenses, kill defenders, and completing an objective (either killing enemies, or blowing up oil derricks/tanks).\nOnce liberated camps give you scrap ever few minutes.\nBeware of minefields - they can be cleared by using a special vehicle, and your dog.\nThere are storms in this game! These are terrifying -but sound and look wonderful!\nThey come in two types; Sandstorms that kill you by hitting you with debris, and Lightning-storms that kill you with scary lightning.\nStaying out in them is dangerous but let you find boxes of scrap. Outrunning them is impossible (but you can try!) but if you reach a liberated camp it ends immediately.\n\nProgression, and Upgrades\nScrap is the main currency of the game. Get it by looting dead enemies, destroying vehicles, and looting locations.\nScrap is used to upgrade your car and gear -including combat skills\nAllied Strongholds can be thought of as your bases. By completing side missions and finding certain project parts you can build things in them that do important things when completed - such as fully refuel your car, restore health, fill your canteen. The best project is the one that auto-collects scrap from destroyed vehicles - prioritize this!\nIf you capture a certain enemy vehicle you can return it to Strongholds for a huge scrap bonus.\nCompleting challanges (which are easy, eg, killing 100 enemies, destroying 30 vehicles, etc.) gives you Griffa Tokens which you can spend by visiting a mystic named Griffa to increase passive stuff like health, or scrap collection.\nIn order to unlock upgrades you must also decrease the threat levels in areas of the maps. This is done by killing snipers, toppling 'scarecrow' towers, liberating camps, clearing minefields, and by attacking and destroying moving conveys of enemies (which is particularly fun, and lets you loot powerful stat-boosting hood ornaments)\nOn-Foot Combat\nPretty basic (which I hold as a positive) at the start - Arkham-Style.\nOne button to attack -hold it down for a heavy attack).\nParry, or dodge attacks.\nYou can pick up weapons, but they break really quickly.\nYou can pick up shivs to quickly execute dazed enemies.\nPurchasable skills allow you to use shivs in more situations, and other cool things.\nYou have a shotgun with very limited ammo for emergencies!\nCar Combat\nVery good  car combat mechanics!\nPrimary means of dealing damage is to hit cars with your car-either side-bashes or frontal impacts (boost is important!)\nYou get a -unlimited, but requires recharging- harpoon to pull off car parts, drivers, structures (towers, doors/walls), enemy troops, and drivers!\nUse your shotgun to explode exposed fuel tanks, and boarders.\nYou also get a Thunderpoon, a rocket launcher.\nDifferent classes of enemy vehicles with different dangers - boarders, flamethrowers, ramming.\nIf your car looses all health you must exit within 5 seconds, then survive on-foot until repairs are done.\nCan repair when not in motion.\nYou can use a sniper rifle to pick of snipers or damage camp defenses at range. You can drive slowly while using it.Audio\nExcellent overall audio quality.\nThe cars sound very good, from the whiny V6 to the throaty V8.\nExplosions sound very good.\nFlamethrowers roar!\nThe storms sound absolutely terrifying!\nThe voice-acting is good, with a smal variety of accents - with Max having an australian voice-actor.\nVisual\nThe framerate was stable - for me, on my mid level gaming PC on High graphics settings, it was +/- 48 FPS\nThe game is beautifull!\nFlames, and explosions look really good.\nThe ruins of the world look like actual ruins - rusty and broken.\nEach area of the map is visually different, and each is thematic!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/recommended/234140/","murderbits","murderbits","http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/","2796 products in account","Mad Max is a completely competent open-world action game with a story that is  short and shallow, but very Mad Max.\n\nMad Max ticks all the open-world action check boxes. You destroy towers (scarecrows) and take over forts to gain influence in each region. You fight against other factions in a Batman-light-style hand to hand combat and an excellent vehicle-combat that includes harpoons, thunderpoons, flame-throwers, depth-charges, ramming bars, boarding spikes, and wheel-shredders.\n\nIn addition to playing through main missions (of which there are only a handful - really, by the time you realize there is a narrative, the story is in its last few missions), there are a lot of side missions that you will run for various demented characters throughout the wastelands.\n\nThe game is beautiful. It also performs very well, showing what you can accomplish when you put effort into your platform optimization. On an i7-4790k with 16GB RAM and NVIDIA GTX 970 SLI system, we see consistent framerates in excess of 140fps at 1920x1080. Even with almost every setting maxed-out and while doing a live streaming session (usually disastrous for framerate on an SLI system due to the way streaming applications capture frames), we hit well-above 100fps.\n\nOther than a shallow and fairly short story, Mad Max doesn't suffer any great failures on any one aspect. Yet, it does not quite seem to be greater than the sum of its parts. It is very entertaining. It has a lot of thoroughly enjoyable aspects, of which vehicle combat is probably the best. But it is also wears out its welcome, by the end. You've eventually had enough sand, screaming crazies running at you, and flame-shooting cars side-ramming you. You've had enough scrap collecting and busy-work -- which this game is riddled with.\n\nIt is competent; not groundbreaking.\n\nBut this should not be a bad thing. And it also does help us to understand why the reviews have been all over the place for this title. It isn't mind-blowing, but it isn't bad. I bought this game for just over half price, just before launch. Due to the discounts we saw everywhere, I was certain they were trying to dump the game while they could and had low expectations. Instead, I found a thoroughly good game for which I have no quarrel having paid half price. At full AAA launch price? Well, I'm not sure it would quite have lived up to that . . . but I wouldn't be disgruntled over it. I would be interested in a sequel to this title, if they make one. They have a solid foundation, here.\n\nIt is difficult for me to say that I do or do not recommend this game. I enjoyed it and feel it was worth what I paid for it. I would not be upset, but perhaps a little disappointed, if I'd paid full price. So, ultimately, I'd have to suggest that if you are a huge Mad Max fan and you can't stop playing open-world games, it may be worth full price. If you just love Mad Max or just love open-world games, then pick it up for half price and you'll probably be very satisfied and surprised.\n\nBelow is the first of a nine part 31hr live-stream playthrough of Mad Max:\nhttps://youtu.be/36oo8PD0REY","September 16, 2015","true","34.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You spend most of your time grinding for scrap for the numerous upgrades for your car as well as Max himself,  these come in the form of demolishing enemy camps, searching old wrecks and buildings, clearing minefields, etc.  The story is good but short and it forces you to complete a lot of these scrap grinds in order to upgrade enough to advance.\n\nThe melee combat feels a lot like the Batman games, and the whole game plays a lot like Shadow of Mordor.  The game is really repetitive with it's tasks but it is very satisfying driving around in your overloaded car getting into road battles and fist fights.\n\nI would highly recommend it for fans of Mad Max but I could see how some people would get bored with it easily.","September 17, 2015","true","39.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Mad Max is a combination of driving and 3D beat-em up.  The action is over the top.  The story is not quite as involved as the aforementioned title but then again this is post-apocalyptic wasteland.  Such a place in reality would be large, dangerous, and empty.  Drama would be a luxury that no one trying to survive could afford.  In that sense, a sparse story fits the locale.  The place may be a large sandbox but the scenery is absolutely gorgeous.  In over 60 hrs of play I've only had two CTD's so the game is well coded.

Anything yellow can be interacted with - ladders, cramped entrances, climbable areas, etc.\nYou can fall a fair bit before you take any damage, but walk slowly if you jump from high up.\nYou can insta-die if you fall too far, but it's pretty forgiving.\nHealth can be regained by eating old dog food, or eating maggots from certain corpses. The main way you regain health is by drinking from your water canteen. The water canteen does not carry that much water but can be refilled from water-stills that refill regularly.\nUnlock the map by going up on a balloon where you must use your binoculars to mark stuff individually. I like this as it's more interactive than alternatives. If you missed something then putting away your bino's lets you look for stuff with a much wider field of vision. Once used, these ballon sites become fast travel points.\nAll locations have a visible checklist of stuff to collect - scrap, historic relics, ammo.\nMost locations on the map are simply for looting -scrap, ammo, fuel, water, collectable historical relics- but are still very varied, and mostly unique.\nEnemy camps can be liberated, but require you to clear perimeter defenses, kill defenders, and completing an objective (either killing enemies, or blowing up oil derricks/tanks).\nOnce liberated camps give you scrap ever few minutes.\nBeware of minefields - they can be cleared by using a special vehicle, and your dog.\nThere are storms in this game! These are terrifying -but sound and look wonderful!\nThey come in two types; Sandstorms that kill you by hitting you with debris, and Lightning-storms that kill you with scary lightning.\nStaying out in them is dangerous but let you find boxes of scrap. Outrunning them is impossible (but you can try!) but if you reach a liberated camp it ends immediately.\n\nProgression, and Upgrades\nScrap is the main currency of the game. Get it by looting dead enemies, destroying vehicles, and looting locations.\nScrap is used to upgrade your car and gear -including combat skills\nAllied Strongholds can be thought of as your bases. By completing side missions and finding certain project parts you can build things in them that do important things when completed - such as fully refuel your car, restore health, fill your canteen. The best project is the one that auto-collects scrap from destroyed vehicles - prioritize this!\nIf you capture a certain enemy vehicle you can return it to Strongholds for a huge scrap bonus.\nCompleting challanges (which are easy, eg, killing 100 enemies, destroying 30 vehicles, etc.) gives you Griffa Tokens which you can spend by visiting a mystic named Griffa to increase passive stuff like health, or scrap collection.\nIn order to unlock upgrades you must also decrease the threat levels in areas of the maps. This is done by killing snipers, toppling 'scarecrow' towers, liberating camps, clearing minefields, and by attacking and destroying moving conveys of enemies (which is particularly fun, and lets you loot powerful stat-boosting hood ornaments)\nOn-Foot Combat\nPretty basic (which I hold as a positive) at the start - Arkham-Style.\nOne button to attack -hold it down for a heavy attack).\nParry, or dodge attacks.\nYou can pick up weapons, but they break really quickly.\nYou can pick up shivs to quickly execute dazed enemies.\nPurchasable skills allow you to use shivs in more situations, and other cool things.\nYou have a shotgun with very limited ammo for emergencies!\nCar Combat\nVery good  car combat mechanics!\nPrimary means of dealing damage is to hit cars with your car-either side-bashes or frontal impacts (boost is important!)\nYou get a -unlimited, but requires recharging- harpoon to pull off car parts, drivers, structures (towers, doors/walls), enemy troops, and drivers!\nUse your shotgun to explode exposed fuel tanks, and boarders.\nYou also get a Thunderpoon, a rocket launcher.\nDifferent classes of enemy vehicles with different dangers - boarders, flamethrowers, ramming.\nIf your car looses all health you must exit within 5 seconds, then survive on-foot until repairs are done.\nCan repair when not in motion.\nYou can use a sniper rifle to pick of snipers or damage camp defenses at range. You can drive slowly while using it.Audio\nExcellent overall audio quality.\nThe cars sound very good, from the whiny V6 to the throaty V8.\nExplosions sound very good.\nFlamethrowers roar!\nThe storms sound absolutely terrifying!\nThe voice-acting is good, with a smal variety of accents - with Max having an australian voice-actor.\nVisual\nThe framerate was stable - for me, on my mid level gaming PC on High graphics settings, it was +/- 48 FPS\nThe game is beautifull!\nFlames, and explosions look really good.\nThe ruins of the world look like actual ruins - rusty and broken.\nEach area of the map is visually different, and each is thematic! (eg, Ex-Ocean floor, a polluted junkyard, etc.)\nStory\nIn the opening cinematic you kill the "Big-Bad-Guy", but lose your car in the process. You meet, and begin to work with a hunchbacked mechanic named Chumbucket. The story then revolves around the two of you building the perfect car, the Magnum Opus. Everything you do is to aimed at fulfilling the goal of getting your car in a good enough condition to cross something Max calls the Plains of SIlence. Along the way you meet plenty of characters that you'll either kill, or work with so that they provide you with goods, services, and better loot. What's very interesting is that although you killed the Big-Bad early on, people talk of him as though he isn't dead, and later in the game they say he has beaten death itself, and has arisen again. Has he ?\n\nMost story and side missions are not particularly exciting or engrossing, but at a specific point the story punches you (and Max) in the face and things pick up in away that makes you MAD - in a very good way. The somewhat disinterested Max becomes Mad Max at last.\n\nThe ending is brilliant, and heart-wrenching. What happens in the finale also explains why Max, who is relatively talkative in this game, is not in Fury Road.\n\nAfter you finish the story you can then keep on playing to 100% the game if you wish.\nIt took me 30 hours to finish the story, but I did not focus on the story and spent a long time playing around in the world.\n\nSource Material\nMad Max: Fury Road is my favourite movie of all time, and I saw it four times in theatres. Other than Fury Road I have watched the three original films but did so long ago that I can barely remember them so I can't really answer this question.\n\nWhat I can say is that the ending of this game is very important for Fury Road lore.\nIf you want to know specifics, and don't mind "kind-of"-spoilers, check below.\n\nIn Fury Road, Max gets hallucinations of a young girl, who calls him her father. This was a tad confusing as Max lost a son in the first movie, not a daughter. This game's ending solves that riddle.","September 12, 2015","true","66.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It's dark. It's brutal. And it's all about survival.\n* Graphics are just superb and well optimized. Avalanche Studios has outdone itself.\n* Unique style of game. It's fresh, creative, and fun.\n* Melee combat\n* Upgrades for Max and his Magnum Opus are addictive to go after.\n* Car combat is really well done and fun. Hijacking convoys is very satisfying.\n\n\nCons:\n* Story is not very appealing.\n* No attachment or affinity to any character in the game. Almost dull.\n* Glitches in the game at random times make it sometimes frustrating.\n* Strongholds, camps, and side missions can get very repetitive, if not boring.\n* Jumping in the game is so silly and useless. The interact button can leap over major obstacles, whereas the jump button can barely jump a foot high. Just straight silly.\n* While fun, melee combat is OP. In fact considering low ammo you often don't have a choice, which leads to repetition.\n* You only have a shotgun as personal weapon. Most weaponry is in your car, with limited ammo.\n* Smashing button for interactions in a game is so year 2000...\n\n\nOverall : 70/100. Worth a buy on huge Steam sale.\n\n","September 12, 2015","true","45.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

The only thing that I can literally say bad about this game's performance is a couple glitches here and there (fell through the map once, car span wildly into the sky another time) that don't even happen that often, once every 8+ hours. As for the length of the game, it took me 24 hours of play time (23 hours, 53 minutes to be exact) to complete all of the story missions & lower the threat level for Jeet's territory to null. The game counts that to be around 40% of the game completed, I'm sure the rest being all of the scavenging locations and whatnot. This game will without a doubt last you more than 48 hours of playtime to 100% it. I picked this game up for $23, and to give a general summary of the purchase, was well god damn worth every penny. Never got bored of it through my three or four binge sessions, either, a nice touch. Only complaint really though is that the combat is basically mash X (or square, for PS controllers), press Y if you see an indicator to counter an attack, and for unavoidable attacks, lunge out of the way. A slight complaint, too, is that the controls are actually smoothed, an effect similar to mouse acceleration, unfortunately, I didn't find a setting to turn this behavior off. Fortunately, after the first hour or two, you will get used to it and you won't feel it thereafter.\n\nAs for the optimization (because it needs it's own paragraph): you can probably run this on a toaster at lowest settings, which really speaks something. My mediocre cards (2x R9 270x, 4GB VRAM, OC edition) can run this game at 60FPS+ with every single setting maxed out with vsync on. In comparison, I get ~60FPS in BF4 on low-medium settings. To summarize, this game is an absolutely optimized beast.\n\nCompletely would recommend this game, seen the movies or not.","September 9, 2015","true","38.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

OK looking graphics but runs very smoothly at 60fps with everything maxed. Xbox controller working well but I have not tried it with kb and mouse.\n\nThe map is huge, with lots to do but this may get a bit repetative as far as I can tell. It feels a bit like Shadow of Mordor and Assassin Creed with similar combat to the Arkham series of games, but with slightly different controls. Combat and driving flows well using controller and is easy to pick up and master.\n\nStory is interesting so far with plenty of upgrades and stuff to earn through gameplay. It looks quite like Rage but it has more emphasis on hand to hand and car combat. I imagine it will be a game that is easy to 100% but rather time consuming. As I said I think the side missions and collectibles could be tedious but I am enjoying it all so far.\n\nI paid £20 and I am very happy with my purchase.

Including Story Missions, Wasteland Missions, Death Run (Races), Scavenging (Looting), camps to build, camps to take down, mines to detect, objects to destroy and much more.\n- Combat, yes it follows the mould of the Arkham games and Shadow of Mordor but its even more satisfying in my eyes. Theres no gadgets, just your fists, a shiv or other enemy weapons. Its brutal, you feel every blow and it makes for many satisfying moments as you activate fury mode or improvise with your environment.\n- Magnum Opus, by far the best part of this game is the desire to grind look in the way of scrap to build up the ultimate battle machine. Ive never felt this in any racer or simulation I've ever played but here your car counts for everything and customisation is very detailed.\n- Racing, most of the games moments result in you trying to survive in your car as you pass patrols or take on the story/side missions. This is fast and frantic. At first its hard but once you build up your car you feel like a total badass.\n- The game is very clever at making the most of all its options as you must meet requirements to continue the story. Some people might not like this but it helped immersion for me as i can lose interest in these open world games.\n- Chumbucket, he's a delightful character who accompanies you, fixing your car and giving tips.\n- Optimisation, like many I put off this game due to WB recent messes but Avalanche have done a fine job and runs smooth as butter.\n- Beautiful environment, the wasteland is ugly but its vast and ultimately stunning as a result. An odd beauty.\n- Storms, these raid you game and unpredictable moments. They are intense.\n- Camera mode, this mode is  really detailed. It brings out the games beauty and the photographer in you.\n- Max himself has a pretty decent levelling system in two ways also.\n\nCONS:\n- So the story is okay, its pacing is strange. Its sudden and didn't feel very long, I preferred the wasteland missions to be honest.\n- Characters, another minor moan that the characters were pretty dense. They're bold but other than Max and Chumbucket they failed to provide any real solid moments.\n- My only major gripe is that some of the meetings with friendly wastelanders are totally pointless. They are meant to serve a few purposes, give you loot, give you intel on camps and to ask a favour in order to gain secret loot. Now the interactions are all very samey and feel like a total after thought. The characters all look the same and are poorly detailed. The voice actors are pretty much the same for each and there reasoning is daft. I would have preferred if they were left out!\n\nVERDICT?\nMad Max is my game of 2015. Caught me by surprise. Its immensely satisfying and very immersive but above all its value for money. Im nearly 50 hours in at this point and still have side missions and camps I want to finish completing.","October 2, 2015","true","50.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game literally popped up on my main screen and I thought to myself "Why the hell not".\n\nSix days later I can only say that this is one of, if not - the best game purchases I've ever made!\n\nThe game mechanics and progression are really well made. It felt very natural to me - seamless and flowing. It might not be as charming for some people due to the kind of repetitive game style (doing the same things over and over) but for me this is the first game in a while that just made me sit down, let go off everything else and just finish it. Even more so, I felt compelled to complete as much of it as possible. After the first couple hours I liked it so much that I knew I had to go on the good ol' 'completionist' spree (still getting there though).\n\nI don't want to spoil the story, but I have to say that for the past few days I was able to build such a personal connection with the main character that the events in the last several missions made me shiver and tremble with hate and anger as I was driving through the wasteland with tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat.\n\nYou just don't see that in games nowadays or at least I haven't for quite some time.\n\nMAJOR PROPS to all the people involved in the creation of this game!\n\n\n**** EDIT ****\n\nI was so overwhelmed that I forgot to mention few other qualities. The game is mighty-well optimized. It runs smoothly and consistently. It is also beautifully made. Even though the majority of the environment is commonly reffered to as a 'wasteland', you will not get bored while wandering around. Each location has a very distinctive styling in my opinion and it helps a great deal to add up to its 'character'.  I was blown away by the areas which were primarily dark. They really do require the use of the flashlight in order to be able to see somewhat decently.\n\nThe only 'con' I'd mention about this game is that I cannot magically forget the story and re-live the whole experience all over :)","December 29, 2015","true","67.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

Of all the WB games that were released on the PC this year, only Mad Max didn't crash and burn in terms of performance. The game's well-optimized state is a huge contrast to the Arkham Knight disaster.\n\nAs a game, Mad Max succeeds in doing what the devs (Avalanche) and distributor (WB) set out to do, which is to recreate the Mad Max experience in a video game. And boy they did. The car combat in Mad Max is fantastic and the foot combat, while it looks like a cheap copy of the combat you see in the Batman: Arkham series manages to hold it's own well enough. Every time you see Max break someone's arm or German Suplex him into the sand, you can almost feel it. While there isn't much variety in terms of enemies and the gameplay does get rather repetitive after a while, you're still guarateed to have one hell of a time.\n\nSurprisingly, Mad Max The Game does have a decent story. While it's pretty straightforward, you do find yourself caring for a few characters including the ever-spouting nonsense Chumbucket. Which makes the ending even worse. Most players aren't happy with Mad Max's ending and when you finally played till there, you'll know why. But I won't spoil it, it's something players have to experience for themselves but I can say it's very very typical of a Mad Max story.\n\nIf there's anything I dislike about the game, it's that the open-world is way too bland. You'd be expecting something like the Fallout series, considering the post-apocalyptic setting but the world design is just vast and empty. You'll find a few tiny camps here and there, then there's the bigger camps where you carry out objectives and get more scrap, upgrades and blueprints to upgrade the strongholds of the allies you'll meet on Max's story. But, that's all. There's nothing really exciting to find in this world.\n\nMad Max is a game to pick up if you're one for intense car combat and plenty of driving. If you're the type that complains about driving too much in a game like GTA for example, then this is not the game for you. If it's up your alley, try playing it in first-person mode. It's difficult but it makes for a very interesting experience as well. Mad Max is no GOTY contender but it's a solid game through and through.","November 7, 2015","true","55.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

In my experience, movie games tend to be poorly made cash grabs, but I had heard good things about this one.\n\nThe leveling system is rather unique. Rather than being based on experience, quests or the like, you raise your legend rank by completing specific tasks, some of them repeatable. This in turn gives you "tokens" which you can redeem with the enigmatic Griffa, who I am not entirely convinced isn't just one of Max's hallucinations. Now, how many tokens you can spend on any one aspect of Max's abilities is gated- a gate which increases as your olegend rank increases. While this does prevent you from just maxing out health right away, it also encourages you to spend tokens in other attributes- and you have to spend them all. Reaching the (heh) Max level is not that hard- by the end of the game, I was 84 levels over the "max" level after I ground to around level 90 at the first stronghold. Not that you have to, but it does make the game significantly easier.\n\nThe Magnum Opus, well, she's a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, once you get fully upgraded thunderpoons there is nothing in the game that can stand in your way. On the other hand, in order to have anything resembling decent handling you have to keep her relatively lightly armored. God forbid you want to do ramming attacks as well, although with thunderpoons, the stock harpoon, and a fully upgraded shotgun you won't really have need of those.\n\nStrongholds... now there's a fun mechanic. Strongholds are safe havens which you can upgrade to give you various benefits, such as free ammo refills, water, a full tank of gas.... basically, everything you need. And the more you improve a stronghold, the more it improves visually as well- you can see the difference you are making as it gets more built-up. Getting all the pieces required to do so can be a bit of a pain, but the payoff is well worth it, and thankfully you can mark their locations on your map while you are in the stronghold.\n\nThe threat mechanic is two things: first, it determines how dangerous an area is by determining how many patrols there are, and second it acts to gate Magnum Opus upgrades. This is a bit of a mixed bag; on one hand, scarecrows and snipers are easy to find, and you can find a number of them just by using the omnipresent balloons which are in every region. On the other hand, clearing camps can become frustrating if you cannot find the last objective to destroy, as these are not in any way marked on your map. Minefields are actually not that bad, though- their is a mechanic for finding them, and it has a good bit of range to it. And generally, clearing out the camps is fun. Convoys are generally meant for when you are highly upgraded- the early ones can be taken out by Max with a fully upgraded shotgun, but the later ones almost certainly need high-powered thunderpoons to do readily.\n\nNow, the story... the wstory actually made me not like Max that much, but it fits; he's trying to survive, and trying to avoid becomming close to anyone. He is very single-mindely focused on his quest to cross the plains of silence, and to build a car that will let him do so. And he does not let anything or anyone get in the way. Could the story have been deeper? Almost certainly. But I do think the story was decent.\n\n\n\nMy conclusion? The game is fun, but as with any game, there are cons. But in my opinion, they do not outweigh the pros.","December 23, 2015","true","50.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So Thank you whoever made this for not leaving us pc gamers out of the equation.\n\nThe Story in Mad max is pretty bland as you might expect, if you are interested in what little one it is then here is a brief explanation for you\n- Max gets his Precious Car stolen by a Bad guy named Scrotus\n- You meet a guy called Chumbucket who makes cars and parts with scrap\n-You team up and over time build yourself up to get Revenge on Scrotus.\n\nOkay thats enough of the story... Go play it for yourself if you want to find out more :D\n\nThe graphics are outstanding on this game and it is easily one of the best looking games I have ever seen especially when the sandstorms come into play.\n\nThe campaign will take on average around 15-20 hours to complete excluding the side missions and it was also very fun to play but others may say that it gets a bit repettive with all of the driving and fighting you have to do.\n\nThe world like I said at the start of this review is full of things to see and do. The attention to detail on this game is unlike no other I have seen this year.\n\nMy downsides would be that all of the boss battles are pretty much identical with the mehods you need to kill them which is pretty sad because I like a bit more variation with these things. When playing them it reminded me a hell of a lot like the Wolf boss battles in the Order 1886 which is not a good thing in my book.\n\nAnother downside is the extremely bland fighting controls, All you have is punch, block and a couple other "special moves".\n\nMy final downside would be to do with the extremely bland ending which I will not spoil here.\n\nOverall, Since this game is on sale it is a must buy!\n\nMy rating is a 8/10\n\nUPDATE 1- Have a look at my Profile for some screenshots :D\n\nUPDATE 2- I recommend installing Windows 10 as it gave the game a 3fps boost for me :D","January 1","true","28.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerax7/recommended/234140/","zerax7","Z Has Come To!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerax7/","487 products in account","tl;dr version in the end\n-----------\nI usually don't make long reviews, unless it's a game that got overlooked and worth giving a chance.\n\nMad Max Is an Action RPG Open-World game developed by the same studio that brought you Just Cause games.\n\nAt first you would say "Another game based on a movie? Nah, it will be crap"\nBut this isn't the case. This is really probably the best movie tie-in Video Game in long, long time.\n\nThis Game feels like a 3rd person version of RAGE (remember RAGE? another post-apocalyptic game).\nYou get a car, you upgrade it and your arsenal, gets to several areas/strongholds/camps, meets new people, gets missions and so on.\n\nStory: 6/10The Story, however isn't really that outstanding.\nMad Max gets picked on by War Boys, stole his car and he want to get it back to continue his journey, instead he found a guy that offered him a "Car with potential". But Max found out that car can't withstand the harsh environment, so he need to work hard to upgrade it so he can get out of the place to somewhere else.\n\nGameplay: 8.5/10Mad Max is a 3rd Person Action RPG. That means you navigate through the world. Loot scraps, fight random enemies and loot them, destroy threats, help strangers, take down strongholds and upgrade your companions' ones for services.\n\nThe combat is a kin to that of Batman Arkham Games, you use you arms to strike down enemies and break their bones and necks and you can carry weapons to crush skulls (the game is so violent btw) while countering incoming attacks.\nIn addition of that, you have a shotgun for quick kills but ammo is so scarce and hard to find.\n\nIn Vehicles. Your Magnum Opus equipped with a Harpoon to pull enemies and objects with and a Rocket-Launcher-like weapon to destroy other cars and metallic gates and a Sniper Rifle to take down long range enemies. With further upgrading, you could make your car a moving flame thrower.\n\nDuring your navigation in the world, enemies will ambush you, chase you and annoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.\nYou can shoot down their cars' tires, blow up their engines and take their loot for bigger scraps.\n\nThe World is that big, so many activities to do.\n\nAs for collectibles. There are historic relics that give you some other people's thoughts and concerns from the world before the Nuclear weapons fell. They are really interesting to read.\n\nGraphics & Design: 9/10The game is surprisingly very detailed. The environment, the locations and in-doors places are very well-designed.\nlike the sand hills which looks beautiful and realistic in the desert areas, and the mountainous and valleys areas looks damn gorgeous giving the perfect post-apocalyptic sight.\nThe Character models and animations are detailed, high quality stuff.\n\n\nBosses: 5/10\nThe worst thing about this game is probably the Boss Fights. There are several Bosses (named TopDogs here)\nin each Stronghold and at the end of several missions. But the problem is.... They Are ALL the SAME.\n\nThey are all the same design, same pattern, same animations, and the same way you have to do to take them down.\nIt feels like it's just 1 boss that spawn in different locations. No variety at all. Good thing they don't appear all the time so it's just a matter of choice to encounter them all.\n\nUpgrade System: 7.5/10\nAnother unique, but annoying feature of the game.\nThe upgrade system doesn't rely on the player experience points gained from battles or missions.\nInstead, it rely on Challenges made throughout your actions. Like defeating enemies with specific ways or take them down within a specific time.\nIn addition to character upgrade point which you can spend on Health Points, Loot/Ammo/Water/Food bonus,etc...\nThat's for Max's character abilities.\nFor Car's upgrades, they get unlocked for more reduction of threats you made in the world.\n\nOther upgrades are only unlocked for completing specific missions.\n\nConclusion: 8.5/10 Don't really know if i can recommend it for a full price or on sale. I got it $20 and enjoyed it.\nSo, it's depends in your budget.\n\nQuick Summarized Review:\nThe Good:\n+ Too many things to do\n+ Combat System is well-made\n+ Taking over Strongholds and Camps is fun\n+ Collecting relics is a fun read\n+ Upgrading Max and the Magnum Opus is super rewarding\n+ Beautiful and detailed world environment\n+ Missions and side missions are varied\n\nThe Bad:\n| Upgrading things you want can takes too long time to unlock\n| Lowering threats for car upgrades can be repetitive and annoying\n\nThe Ugly:\n- Absolutely no variety for Bosses. It's just 1 Boss with different skins.\n- Max has an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character.","October 23, 2015","true","28.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","5"

It kinda suffers from that problem that a lot of open world games these days suffer from (mosdtly from Ubisoft) where it basically just gives you a laundry list of things to do. In concept, it doesn't sound fun, but in actual gameplay it is pulled off surprisingly well, considering how wonderful the mechanics of the game flow with oneanother. This game has a lot of really good design choices that are so discrete most people wouldn't notice them. Things such as when you're taking down an encampment, when you get to the end and finish it, they always make an easy way to get back to your Magnum Opus rather than making you backtrack through the entire area, I love that. Little details like that go a LONG way towards enjoyment. There are also a few very bad design choices, such as the boss fights which are very tedious and generally annoying. Luckily they're fairly far enough between that it doesn't get in the way often. The driving is perfect, not much to say there. The weapons feel powerful and have a very satisfying animation when they are used. Also not much to say about the on-foot combat, it's been done before, and better, but it's solid and I relish any opportunity I get to beat the heck out of some War Boys. Customization of your Magnum Opus and Max I also feel are a stroug point, because of how tangible the benefits of upgrading each are. With each upgrade there is a noticeable change in how the game plays. For example, changing out the tires od the Magnum Opus dramatically changes the way you approach driving. Some specialize in dricing on sand, off road, or on asphalt. The feeling of progression is wonderful. The story isn't all that great, but that's alright in my book considering the newest entry to the Mad Max thatrical series (Fury Road) was also lacking in story, but that seems like a strong point. There really isn't such a need for story in games like this because I would rather be ramming cars with my beautiful Magnum Opus or beating bad guys into the ground. And considering how solid the gameplay mechanics are, the lack of story is welcomed. PC performance was absolutely wonderful and I feel that this game should be a role model for other games releasing to follow as far as optimization. I tested the game with multiple setups, even one with an integrated GPU. The game ran beautifully on every setup (with the settings tweaked accordingly of course). I did notice a bit of stutter where the game would freeze for about 1/3 of a second every 15-20 minutes or so. Nothing game breaking, on fact, it was hardly noticeable, but something to keep in mind. It happened on every setup including my 980 with a 4790K. There's also a few performance issues in Gastown later in the game where the frame rate will drop to about 40fps even with my settings turned down on the high end system. Also not too noticeable,but can get annoying, especially considering that area is literally the worst. There's a whole lot more to talk about, but even after 70 hours of play time I still am itching to get back into the game.","November 5, 2015","true","144.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

What I mean by that is that it aint great but it aint bad either.\nstill confused? Well let me explain to you why I said this.\nIm basing my review on how well it plays, how the story is, the driving  and fighting mechanics and ofcourse how the game handles in general ( performance, glitches and bugs)\n\nPROS\nShooting other people out of their cars with a harpoon has never been so satisfying\nEating dogfood once in a while is apparently good for your health\nBatman arkham series inspired hand to hand combat which aint bad\nRamming cars, harpooning cars, blowing cars up.\nLots of explosions ( like a M.Bay movie)\nBig sandy world to explore\nsome intresting side objectives called wasteland missions\nDecent voiceacting\nA lot of customization on max and the Magnum opus\nProgression system (griffa tokens)\nRagdoll glitches are hilarious\ngame is optimized aswell which is rare these days\nTHE CONS:\nThe short average story\nNone of the characters were really that intresting\nCollecting relics and such is a pain in the ♥♥♥ because there are around 200 locations to loot.\nClearing camps, vantage outposts etc takes a while and you can say its pretty repetitive.\nThe game gets a bit dull and repetitive at times\nDont get me wrong. I do recommend this game. But there are some points on which Mad Max falls short.\nSo we have to talk about that. I was really excited when they announced the game after seeing the movies. I got ready to have myself a great time.\nDid I have a great time? at times.. yes but..\n\n1: the wasteland you drive trough doesnt have a lot to offer in terms of eyecandy. Now I know that thats what they were probably going for but it made me personally fast travel to everything as much as I could.\n\n2: What I didnt  enjoy in this game is the fact that you have to clear all the vantage points, convoy routes, minefields and camps to unlock upgrades for certain items. As I said earlier. the Map is kinda big. there are a bunch of areas. but after clearing 2-3 areas the taking over of camps and clearling minefields becomes repetitive and boring at some points.\n\nConclusion & Final verdict\n\nTo sum it all up and keep it short(ish). The core of the game is great. the ramming the shooting and the fighting is very well executed. the voiceacting is good enough and the wasteland does have enough things to keep you busy. While some of them bore me you might enjoy yourself clearling camps and minefields all day but thats completely up to you ofcourse. Overall I did enjoy the game and the story was decent enough to make me go trough it entirely. The customization is well done and did I mention that the game is  DAMN WELL OPTIMIZED?!\n\nI salute the developers for bringing out a game that works from day one, Has great graphics and just the occasional bug to make you laugh (ragdoll glitches). It is rare these days that games actually work from day one.

It nails the wasteland feel perfectly and manages to pull you in the world of Mad Max and all it's craziness without falling flat. And I must say this game has been optimized beautifuly\n\nStory\nYou play as Mad Max(as if that wasn't obvious) and take on your fellow companion, Sméagol Chumbucket who has devoted his life to serve you as his blackfinger, and your car, the Magnum Opus as your angel. You will be doing wasteland missions for a ton of interesting characters mostly crazy people and help them thrive as the new leaders in their own regional territory. But Max mostly wants to get his car rebuild after it being wrecked by Scrotus at the beginning of the game, needing to build a car faster, stronger and more badass than his original car, the Black on Black.\n\nGameplay\nIt follows the simple Batman Arkham games combat, and makes it more brutal, every punch feels powerful and painful to look at, and if you can get behind the combat on foot, you'll be very happy with this game. You'll be equipped with a shotgun for long range, shivs for combat finishers and the brutal yet satisfying Fury Mode which your punches are harder and looks like Max is putting his whole body in them. Now we have the car combat which is very hit or miss, as the car controls are heavy and delayed, almost like a real car. You can add on extra stuff on your car such as grinders, rams and armors which will affect your cars performance. Your car will be equipped with a harpoon, sniper and thuderpoons and other stuff I never used such as burners(side flamethrowers). Max can gain upgrades as well but they are very direct and are just direct upgrades from what you already have, such as shotgun, knuckles, armor, ammo capacity etc.\n\nReplayability\nI will be adding replayability because the whole game is your replaying missions all over again, in order to unlock story missions you need to attack strongholds, that have the same objective(Find oil rig and blow it up) or anything that will lower threat in a territory. Some story missions include doing these same repetitive tasks in 5 regions of the map, if you are ok with this then the game won't be a problem for you, but the game requires you can tollerate the combat and everything else the game offers you, otherwise the game will fall flat near the end.\n\nPROS    Great on-foot combat\nPerfect optimization\nAmazing graphics for how well it runs\nBig and immersive worldCONS    Repetitive gameplay\nMeh car controls(subjective)\nMax is a complete bully in this game\nAll in all, great game, immersive and great atmosphere. A bit repetitive and meh car controls.\n\nI'd give this game a 8/10","February 23","true","38.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/234140/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","If devs could mix assassins creed combat with GTA racing, Mad Max would be born. The game starts with a roar and ends with the gamer wondering if doing it again is worth it.\n\nThe story (which is a pretty interesting one to say the least) revolves around the gamer playing as Max, a man scavenging the desert wastelands. As you progress through the game, you unlock upgrades for your car and perform different missions for various warlords. Max does this in hope of getting to gastown, a town filled with all the guzzoline (not gasoline) one could wish for. Unfortunately, the whole wasteland is overrun by Scrotus's War Boys. Max has to clear out their camps to get rid of the threat in different areas.\n\nThe gameplay is simple but has it's moments of fun. There are only two buttons required for combat : parry and strike. While it is simple, clearing out 10 to 15 guys in a in a camp is satisfying until it starts becoming redundant.  Additionally while engaging in combat, cans of gas can be lit on fire to blow up enemies and shotguns can be used to get enemies at a distance. The driving part is fun due to it's simplicity but isn't as action packed as clearing a camp The driving controls are your basic right trigger to accelerate and joystick to control the wheels. The car has the ability to ram into others with a simple tap of the button. The car, the Magnum Opus is very customizable. The areas that of the car such as engine (transmission), body armor and thunder poons, which is the coolest weapon. Additionally,  players can acquire cool hood ornaments that give the car upgrades. To take down enemies in towers, sniper rifles and harpoons can be used for extreme distances. There are many ways to keep entertained when roaming around, you may clear out scarecrows, scavenge war boy locations, and (of course) clear out gas camps.\n\nGraphics and sounds are also well done in this game. If your car takes damage, it's very apparent. Max will be bruised up and walk with a limp if he falls a certain distance. Your car can also go up in flames if you damage it too much. There is a neat visual feature in which Max's hair becomes longer over the course of the game. Max himself is also customizable. The sand looks very clean as do all the enemies. (When you bump into rocks or drive through a large pool of sand, the environment will react to you. There is a huge variation in the Scrotus War Boys compared to the many enemies that appear very different. The camps also look amazing. Many details are put into secret entrances into the camps so it is difficult to find the small opening you need to get in. The progression through camps is also what makes them special. Many small details go into making the huge world look clear to the human eyes. The water and sand look like they should but they vary in their appearance depending on which region Max is in. The enemies make noises when they fall off ledges and get hit. The sound is clear and grunts are well heard. Max seems to be in an active environment at all times.\n\nThe story line/campaign could have been better but seems to be the high light of the game. As I've said, it becomes repetitive : go collect or defeat this warlord can lose its grace after a while. Clearing out minefields and scarecrows can easily become tedious (and booooring). Also, when you have to drive across the map for sulphur, that's enough to drive anyone crazy. The game is good but has the potential to be a lot better. Following missions and clearing out camps can keep only keep you busy and entertained to a certain extent. All in all, this is a decent game. If you enjoy driving around in a free world like GTA and a bit of action raiding camps, this will appeal to you. It seems everyone I talk to either quit this game after 2 hours or kept playing it. It truly is a game in which I feel anyone can pick up and learn to play easily within an hour (which isn't always necessarily bad)!\n\n\nI will recommend this game but with extreme caution. If one of your friends has this and their sharing this game with you, better to play it that way!\n\n\nRATING : Regular average 7.0/10\n\n\n\nScreenShots :\n\n////to come\n","May 13","true","12.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Play time isnt accurate to my steam account as a friend plays when I'm not. The above save (mine) sits at 99.3 hours total for anyone curious and the final achievement is... one that could take an hour or another ten heh.\n\nFun game, open world. Vehicle use feels like RAGE or Far Cry 4 with a masterpiece combat system. Grappeling hooks, thunderpoon(rocket launcher), nitrous, fully upgradeable vehicles, over fifty vehicles ingame btw.\n\nOn foot combat is melee focused, your only ranged weapon is your shotgun but ammunition limits plus overall use steers you towards melee combat which feels like any of the batman titles.\n\nThe story itself feels set aside all the way until the last 15% of the story play at which point it goes knee deep and becomes more engaging. Sadly though it dosent answer some popular questions amongst this franchises fanbase such as a, where is fury road timeline wise with the original trilogy and b, is this the original mad max or someone else and c, is he married before the game or during the game only.\n\nThankfully the story isnt the main focus of enjoyment. There are hundreds of places to explore/loot, vehicles to collect and upgrade, talent points, races, convoys to chase everywhere, strongholds to build, relics to collect, it rocks!\n\nI walk away from this game now (until some sort of dlc of course) satisfied that I got my money's worth out of it. I'd like dlc, I'd like more lore depth explored, more non hostile groups out there in the wastes to encounter, more exploration in to ruins of the old world, there's lots of potential here. I have no hope that this game will match fallout 4 when it arrives but there is ALOT that can be done to this game to put it on a level near F4 when it hits in november :)","September 1, 2015","true","126.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The location is the bottom of a dried up ocean, it wasn't so much the ships giving me the clue but the coral and dried up sea weed as well. You have your rivle bandit gangs. You have your mission story lines, one of the things I did was wounder off on my own in the game, And yes, you can do that.\n\nBeing a Stalker in the Zone from the stalker series, I am use to exploring and looking for salvege anyway. So this game comes home to that for me. The most outstanding thing in the game is the ability to asign key bindings. I use a speacle combat key layout compatable for many of my games that work in STALKER series, COD series, Elder scroll series, and the fall out series.\n\nAnd it is so refreshing to see I can also use that here. And the binding are split between the car and ground(foot) controls which is a sweet deal to prevent control conflicts. Driving can be a bit tricky, but I have discovered you do not have to fly at high speed all the time, speed can work against you. For example one of the cars chasing me from the grave yard was on me, but I turn right and left and it cause him to shake loose giving me enough room to lock up the brakes, he passed me, and I blew up him up by shooting his tank. They realy put serious thought to actuly plauseability car control. The positive I have been coming across so far in this game, I have no choice but to recomend it!\n\nEDITED 4/18/2016\nI had finished the game, I didn't care much for the death races, they really were not my thing. So really the only way I will do it, I have to be forced into it. SO... I was. The Stank Gum race I hated the most. You really have to configure that car. All the speed is not that answare, nor is all the armor. I used the wild hunt through the whole game, and I had it almost stripped down to a compleat stock car. You may get a bif time gap before boom, but that was all redundant. The key was how fast you can take out stank gum in the race. I had to finsh him off inside of a lap. So going into the second lap after passing the start line I defeated him. Then its like the game gets crazy.\n\nIn the end the game is open for free roaming. Once I got my rewards of free roaming, I actully for got the fustaration of all that from stank gum to scrotuis. And was happy. I Kind of wish now I didn't do all them side missions I could have dodged, or find all them scrap locations. Its been very quiet. I have car jacked a few vehicles to add to my colection. Still do not bother with the death races. But you know what, I am good with that. Maybe I just pay it again and do some things different.\n\nMy recommendation still STANDS...","December 23, 2015","true","38.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Some negative reviews didn't get it that you have to move Max in order to block properly. Also unlike other games, enemies will attack and not wait till it's their "turn".\n- Nice feeling of progression.\n- Upgrades that are at least as meaningful as in any other game.\n- Unlike Shadow of Mordor: Items and NPCs won't re-spawn directly in front of you each time you move 2m away and you don't have to kill the exact same enemies you did one minute ago.\n- Much to do (of the same type). But you don't have to.\n- Runs great on a PC and that at release date (should be normal, but isn't).\n- No DLC grinder at release.\n- Ingame screenshot editor for creative players.\n- Only a few female characters. :)\n\nCons:\n- No motorbikes. :(\n- Boss fights in camps could be more interesting.\n- Side-missions lack variety. As in many other games.\n- Car controls are horrible, if you don't have upgrades. So at start you get frustrated easily.\n- Only a few female characters. ;)\n\nOverall:\nGreat game, but not without flaws. Apart from the car combat, nothing really new that stands out. But that isn't a bad thing, when the package is done right. Had a lot of fun with the game. I don't give much about paid reviews or reviews that make judgements on debug code.\n\nWorth a buy? - For me: Yes, but not for the price on Steam. You can get it much cheaper from third party sites.","September 20, 2015","true","86.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","2"

I love this game and what it has to offer, the fist fighting is great, but I also love the car action. Another cool thing about Mad Max is that you can upgrade you and your car a lot! Mad max has outstanding amount of fun.\n\nIt may have some bugs and optimization issues, but Mad Max is one of the best games I have ever played before. It offers so much fun and adventure, it is kinda hard to say you don't like it.

It's definitely a surprise hit of 2015. I wasn't expecting too much from this game until I did more digging to find out that Avalanche Studios is behind it... the people who brought us Just Cause 2 and the decently fun original Just Cause. I decided to get it and I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely among the best Movie to Video Game adaptations.\n\nThe open world is everything that should be a Mad Max game. It's violent, lots of scavenging (even for gross food types to refill your health) and lots to do. The areas aren't super unique minus changes in enemy vehicle appearances and combat characteristics which is plenty fine by me as you constantly evolve the Magnum Opus, the vehicle that Mad Max uses for most of the game sections.\n\nThe vehicles are the best part of the game which is good since what kind of game would Mad Max be if the car combat sucked right? lol... but they definitely focused a lot on getting the vehicle handling and physics right combined with the combat and it makes it so enjoyable to wreck enemies... the only gripe I'd have? Late in the game? You get barely any scrap (tbh I think it's the same amount of scrap as the beginning of the game lol) for destroying enemy cars that I found it a little tedious instead of a good way to get more scrap to keep upgrading.\n\nOn-foot combat is quite smooth and it varies between basic attack, weapon attacks, countering, dodging and fury mode which makes Max really strong and can make swarms of enemies a little more bearable without making it too easy which is good… my only gripe? Mini-bosses… they’re all just reskins. Some have their own Biography in the “Bio” menu… but the exact same attacks and all that…. Wish there was more variety other than just textures. Even the Buzzards have the same thing but a different NPC model.\n\nThe Avalanche Engine used in this game btw? VERY well optimized. The game looks great at max settings and can do 60fps without issues and I don’t get any dropped frames. It might also be due to less things to render since it’s a barren wasteland, but no matter where I was it ran smooth with the game making good use of my i7 CPU and two-way SLI GTX 680 2GB setup. Oddly enough? There isn’t a graphical preset for maximum graphical settings so you’ll want to manually go through the settings to max the graphics out.\n\nThere isn’t much for story much like the movies but what is here is still decent and it did want me to see how the game ended. Same goes for characters. There isn’t a large cast, but the cast that is here are all quite different from each other and the voice acting for all of them was pretty darn good overall.\n\nSo for fans of open world action games? Definitely play Mad Max. It’s worth it. I had about 47 hours of playtime with doing the majority of side quests and beating the game so it's got good length to it too.","October 25, 2015","true","47.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's great... BUT...\n\nThis has been one of the most enjoyable games I've played in some time.  No bugs to speak of, fluid ground combat, good car mechanics (in the open, anyway), good atmospherics.  I had nothing bad to say about this game... until the Gastwon Race.  This is a story mission that basically locks off the V8 engine and all further story advancement if you cannot complete it.\n\nAnd I cannot.\n\nIt's not a matter of trying again or trying with a different configuration of car components.  I've tried and tried, and I've read online guides (such as they are) and the bottom line is that this beautiful, fun game ~ruined~ its reputation with me because of this one, required, mission for which there is precious little precedent.  The death races, the most similar mission, are wide open.  Racing in the confines of the Gastown track is an entirely different experience.\n\nI would have liked to have seen the ~rest~ of the game, but this one mission that I cannot beat has pretty much bricked the game for me.   I got the game on sale, which is the only way I can advocate getting it, now.  And at that, I would urge people to enjoy the game ~while you can~ because that Gastown Race would infuriate a pope.","March 5","true","43.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is Fallout 4 in, like a month or two. Was it really a good idea to release this game today? Everyone is thrilling for Wasteland, but not for Mad Max. And when Fallout 4 came out, this game became completely forgotten.\nI bought them both together at the same time, start to play them at the same time and have a high expectation from both of them. And guess what, Mad Max win with his flags far more higher.\nThis game gave me everything I hoped for. Perfect battles, either on ground or in vehicles (I know, that ground battles are taken from Batman, but who cares? If something work well, why change it?), very open world with a ton of things to do (yes, they start to be kind of repetitive after some time, but give me one game of this type, where it is not), perfect customization of either Max and his car Magnum Opus (that name is a joke on its own) and most of all, feeling similar to all films (not just last one), that Max is not a main hero, but more of an observer, who is used by the warband leaders, few other story NPC´s  and mostly by his "sidekick" Chumbucket.\nBecause I´m perfectionist and I like to clean wasteland as much as possible, after 51.6 hours, I´m still in the middle of the story (or maybe more like in 2/3), but from the feeling I have until now, I expect gameplay time for casual player around twenty or thirty hours, which is not bad.\nThe only thing, that I fear off is, that when I will finish this game, I will do not want to play it again.\n\nEDIT: After finishing the game I need to add few more thoughts.\nStory: There is a break point in the game, where Max stop to be just an observer and really became a main character of the game. Of course it is because of someone else and you can even feel a glimpse of hope for some time, but this is Mad Max and of course everything turn to ♥♥♥♥.\nAlso, at the end of the game, I started to believe, that this is really a prequel to film Fury Road (I think, that it was never officially said)\nGame mechanics: One good thing at the end of the game. I enjoy busywork and side quests and for that I regret, that I did few story missions to soon and it close me access to some of them. After you finish the game, all those dead NPC´s and quests are available again, which is very nice, because it allow you to finish the game up to 100 percent (if you want to), without repeating it again.\n\nLast one thing I´d like to say. This game never crash on me. 60 hours of play and no CTD! This is one of the best port of console game to PC. Please, do more conversions like this. I thank you for this a lot.","February 29","true","75.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recently saw the new film and was very impressed by its return, most notably in the production design of the vehicles, war boys and the world in which they lived.\n\nThis game is a fantastic expansion on that universe, setting its own story, mood and pace within that Mad Max universe. It's like a post apocalyptic GTA and all that matters is making sure your motor keeps getting better. I was able to run around for hours enjoying the added side jobs and trying to improve on my Magnus Opus (the car) before I even really tackled the story, but once I did, I was fully entertained.\n\nGood car upgrading and customisation\nGood fight mechanics and upgradable skills\nFreaking awesome road fights\nBig camps to bust in and fight through\n\nBut there certainly are some issues like;\nThe bosses were not very challenging,\nIt does get very samey after 20 hours, but still adictive.\nNo multiplayer other than time trials on some races,\nOnce you upgrade to a mid point in the game (both car and character), it's way too easy.\nA few really neat ideas, like collecting gas and water, become redundant way too quickly.\n\nI bought this game on sale and have thoroughly enjoyed my purchase. I recommend this title if you fancy a good solo romp through desolate waste lands, beating every shabby driver to a pulp while you fasten as much spare metal to your car in the effort to be the king of the road.

The areas aren't super unique minus changes in enemy vehicle appearances and combat characteristics which is plenty fine by me as you constantly evolve the Magnum Opus, the vehicle that Mad Max uses for most of the game sections.\n\nThe vehicles are the best part of the game which is good since what kind of game would Mad Max be if the car combat sucked right? lol... but they definitely focused a lot on getting the vehicle handling and physics right combined with the combat and it makes it so enjoyable to wreck enemies... the only gripe I'd have? Late in the game? You get barely any scrap (tbh I think it's the same amount of scrap as the beginning of the game lol) for destroying enemy cars that I found it a little tedious instead of a good way to get more scrap to keep upgrading.\n\nOn-foot combat is quite smooth and it varies between basic attack, weapon attacks, countering, dodging and fury mode which makes Max really strong and can make swarms of enemies a little more bearable without making it too easy which is good… my only gripe? Mini-bosses… they’re all just reskins. Some have their own Biography in the “Bio” menu… but the exact same attacks and all that…. Wish there was more variety other than just textures. Even the Buzzards have the same thing but a different NPC model.\n\nThe Avalanche Engine used in this game btw? VERY well optimized. The game looks great at max settings and can do 60fps without issues and I don’t get any dropped frames. It might also be due to less things to render since it’s a barren wasteland, but no matter where I was it ran smooth with the game making good use of my i7 CPU and two-way SLI GTX 680 2GB setup. Oddly enough? There isn’t a graphical preset for maximum graphical settings so you’ll want to manually go through the settings to max the graphics out.\n\nThere isn’t much for story much like the movies but what is here is still decent and it did want me to see how the game ended. Same goes for characters. There isn’t a large cast, but the cast that is here are all quite different from each other and the voice acting for all of them was pretty darn good overall.\n\nSo for fans of open world action games? Definitely play Mad Max. It’s worth it. I had about 47 hours of playtime with doing the majority of side quests and beating the game so it's got good length to it too.","October 25, 2015","true","47.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Car handling is touchy.\nI've switched back and forth between Keyboard/Mouse and Gamepad...and gotten frustrated with both.\nThe FOV is console-level and unadjustable, so you feel like you're breathing down your character's neck  on a widescreen monitor.\nI can see some of this getting tedious after a while.\n\n\nAfter the Arkham Knight fiasco, it's refreshing to see a PC game come out so polished and beautiful (if a wasteland can be considered beautiful...and it is, actually.)","September 1, 2015","true","67.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A lot of people will hate on this because it does nothing especially new with the open world genre, or close combat fighting systems, given that the fighting is basically completley cribbed off Batman: Arkham Location's fighting system pretty much.\n\nPersonally I don't think these people are wrong, but they are focusing far too much on that. When it gets down to it, Mad Max is a very capable, very good open world game. There's lots of sidequests and things to do, taking out camps is a lot of fun, clearing out convoys, upgrading strongholds, upgrading the car and Max's equipment and max himself are great fun, the scavenger hunt for history relics is actually really interesting and really does enrich the world and setting...\n\nThere's a good deal of great characters used remarkably well too, though the scant female presence in the game is relegated to 'current necessary "move the plot forward" key', 'damsel in distress who could have been way more badass but in the end is merely a mcguffin for the story' and  'cute kid you see almost nothing of'. This is a little bit of a shame, but ultimately doesn't detract too much from the game's story.\n\nSpeaking of, I personally feel that the game's story is exceptionally well done. It's really well shot and acted, the graphics are fantastic and even when you aren't playing on full graphics with everything turned on it still looks great (apart from shadows feeling a little shonky at times). The cars drive well, the missions are great fun, and the story plays out wonderfully.\n\nHhhoooweeeverr... I do have one pressing issue. I am a big fan of all four Mad Max films. I actually have gained a new appreciation for even Beyond Thunderdome, despite how cheesy it is at times and how it devolves into Peter Pan: Wasteland Edition at the end. In all but the first one, Max isn't really the main character. He's not the character the story is really about. He is an observer to, a reluctant participant in, and essentially the mcguffin OF the storyline. The Road Warrior is more about a group of escaping survivors and their plan to be free of their pursuers. Thunderdome is about the rise and fall of Auntie Entity. Fury Road is about the rebellion of and eventual rise to power of Imperator Furiosa through brutal conquest. In all three of those, Max is simply (to steal a line from HL2), "the right man in the wrong place".\n\nI suppose when it comes down to it, the game is more of a call back to the first film, where the story is rather squarely centralised around him, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It does feel a little like it's lacking somehow as a result, but honestly if you see it as a prequel to Fury Road, it does work rather surprisingly well, and the way it's all executed really grants a lot of depth to Max and his madness. There's lots of subtle details here and there, lots of tidbits of details that let you fill in the gaps on your own without you being left scratching your head in confusion.\n\nGameplay of course is pretty much rock solid, driving works great, fighting is visceral and brutal and very kinetic, and there's a lot to keep you busy. However I did find myself at certain points going through sidequests just so I could fully upgrade the car and wishing, wishing I didn't have to deal wth certain things. I imagine if you just went for the main plotline, the game would be over fairly quickly. I'd guess I spent the majority of my hours doing sidequests, exploring scavenging locations, building projects in strongholds and just bumming around doing stupid crap in the wastes, but I still had fun for the most part.\n\nIt does everything right for an Open World game, but it excels at very little. Nevertheless its story is definately worth experiencing and the game is really well done. Very, very, VERY few faults, and an exceptional port for PC.\n\nWorth picking up, definately.","November 8, 2015","true","67.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You will die while counter an enemy if another one is hitting you, which is absurd, and sometimes you right click to parry and you still get hit cause it doesn't register. Seems like Max can't parry when he's not directly facing an enemy, which is a turn down for me.\nYes you have the dodge option but what good is the parry if you have to dodge to not get hit?\nI have been dying a couple of times in fights with 4 or 5 + enemies because of this.

I haven't gotten to it yet.\nThere is NO MULTIPLAYER.  This game would have done great with MP.  Even a COOP mode.  Car battles or Convoy missions could easily have been made.  Disregarding server costs :P\nNo Motorcycles either.  Motorcycles are a big part of the Mad Max universe, but there aren't even NPC motorcycles.\n\n\nThe Story isn't that immersive or great.

"oh damn here we go again, I have to commit the next 2 hours to destroying camps so I can buy those new tires I just unlocked." Seriously though, if I didn't have this crazy drive inside myself to see that car reach it's full potential (by that I mean unlock every upgrade) I'd probably have stopped playing a while ago.

It's a great port in terms of options, it looks great and it runs fabulously. Not only that, but the game is fun to boot. The car combat is satisfying, the fist combat is meaty and far more varied than reviews like Gamespot's would lead you to believe and the RPG elements are satisfying in that they offer meaningful choices. Do I want my car to hit hard and move fast, or do I want to be a lumbering tank? Those choices, as well as anything in between, offer different styles of gameplay that are suitable for anyone who enjoys open world action games.\n\nNo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, just a good game and an even better PC port.\n\nP.S.

Very weird, but great. Love all the practical effects\nand the small use of CGI. Own it on bluray.\n\nGame is pretty good too! Amazingly well optimized, runs smooth even my old video\ncard. Well worth the ~11 euros I spent on it! If you can get it cheap, then dont hesitate.\n","December 14, 2015","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Feels unfinished, as though they had all the elements in, but could only fine tune so many before release.  Despite that, it's surprisingly solid.\n\nAfter being disappointed with the overall feel of Fallout 4, this satisfied my post-apocalyptic hunger.","March 21","true","50.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Beware of a bug in A Piece Tougher. If you destroy the convoy in the southeast corner of Gutgash's territory before starting that story mission, it will glitch and you will be stuck. I just lost 3 hours to that bug.\n\nOther than that, so far, it is a great game. A more thorough review will come once I get past that bug.","September 6, 2015","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It perfectly expresses the depressing and cruel world of Mad Max. The vehicle combat is entertaining and filled with explosions, and the ground combat is bloody and brutal.","March 30","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I quite honestly don't know what they disliked so much about it.  It's an open world, take over camps, type of game.  Think Farcry 3 and 4.  I, however, think this is more fun than Farcry 4.  The combat system is almost exactly like the Arkham games, that is to say, great.  The Mad Max universe is rich with blood, explosions, and fuel.  If you've seen Fury Road, it's like that, but more gory.  Also, it runs fantastic.  If you've got a mid-range PC, you can run it without compromising graphical quality.\n\nPros:\n-Huge world\n-Great combat\n-Fun upgrades\n-Runs great\n-Good character design\n-Good voice acting\n-Great atmosphere and mood\n\nCons:\n-Jumping and climbing can be a little clunky\n-Can be repetitive\n","February 10","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
