Issue 1 was blatantly the origin story of The Purple Patriot, while the second issue centres around his struggles against bureaucracy to establish himself as a legitimate superhero. Another one of the bizarre aspects of the game is on how it does this. The previous episode goes out of its way to set up a small collection of tropes that the second issue gleefully expels and then acts really smug about it. It knows what it’s doing in its self-referencing with open jabs thrown at its genre and sly nods aimed towards the fourth wall. It feels like Patriots has got all the set-up out of the way and is now free to set its sights on anything it feels the need to lampoon.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12463/pc/supreme-league-of-patriots-issue-2-patriot-frames/review.html","January 29, 2015","true","3.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

His quest to become a true super hero begins: between framing people, buying a car and finding a patriot cave, his day will be filled! Always with his sidekick Melvin, will our dear hero be the hero the town needs? Who is the Bleeding Heart? And what will happen to the Flamboyant Hero? And Nurse Julie? And the Cold War Warrior? And Consuela?\n\nIf you don't mind, I'll copy/paste parts of my review for the first episode, because some remarks for it is valid for Patriot Frames\n\nThe core mechanics is a point-and-click. But I wish that the inventory/utility belt was easier to use. I mean, why should I open the inventory for combining items and use the utility belt to... use them in the scene? Being original is good. But being practical is also a good option. I was really confused at that. I would have prefer the combine option in the utility belt. Why? Because I can easily the utility belt by placing my cursor at the bottom of the screen instead of opening the top of my screen and make a click on the box to open the inventory.\n\nAnother gameplay problem is that you can easily obtain items... but can't use them before speaking to a character. I don't have an exact example in the head - though I know that for episode 3, I had to ask help to Melvin (as he's also the one giving hints) and it was the only way to go forward.\n\nThe dialogues are still in the comedy mood: with the Purple Patriot being "mean" (Kyle is a sweet guy, when he's Kyle and you'll see it only once in episode 2). Thank god, Melvin is the wise guy and his job got harder with the personality change. But now, I understand that the new Purple Patriot is a parody of all the people that could be racist, sexist, homophobic but at an extreme. Besides, while I had a little hard time sometimes to solve the puzzles, I must say that I warmed up to the game.\n\nYet, achievements unlocking every five minutes is really boring after a while. And some are missable, as they're kinda all "hidden".\n\nAnyway, the graphics or the soundtrack are still the same: in a comedy mood, cartoonish and with new locations.\n\nBuy it when it's discounted or in a bundle but I suggest you strongly to play the first episode if you want to follow the story and understand all the references.","October 17, 2015","true","3.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The game let's you take the role of both Kyle and Mel as they venture through the world of superheroes and supervillains. The story is a bit slow on the build up but the actual plot is very unique and original. Each issue comprises about 3-4 hours of gameplay depending on how you solve the puzzles in the game. The puzzles are easy and you won't get off track much since Melvin is there to guide you when you don't know/forgot what you should be doing. The dialgoues and voices are great especially Melvin's british accent.\n\nPros:\n+ A great funny story plot\n+ Great voice acting\n+ Great Music (especially each character's BGM)\n+ Good Graphics\n+ Narrative guide (Mel gives you a hint when you get lost)\n\nCons:\n+ There's a bit of bugs whenever you make Kyle go to an obtacle-full area\n+ There are times that the voices become out of sync with the balloons/text that appear\n\nIf you're looking for a point and click adventure game full of humor, comedy, patriotism, superheroes and supervillains, then Supreme League of Patriots is a must try for you.\n\nI already finished all 3 issues and I just can't wait for season 2! :D","February 15, 2015","true","4.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

I liked the different places and scenarios in this one, but again, there were a couple of places where I had to resort to clicking everything on everything else and travelling backwards n forwards to see if I'd missed anything (I had, but that would be a spoiler, so I say nothing!). Apart from that, my only real gripe was that not enough was made of Kyle's superpowers - they were mentioned, but very underused.\n\nStill, as with part one, an excellent 'filler' type game to give yourself a chill break.","August 5, 2015","true","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Δε θυμάμαι άλλο adventure game που να χαρακτηρίζεται από τόσο διάχυτη και καυστική σάτιρα επί θεμάτων που αφορούν την εποχή κατά την οποία κυκλοφορεί. Κυριολεκτικά καταπιάνεται μ’ ένα σωρό –ευαίσθητα- θέματα, προσπαθώντας να περάσει ανθρώπινα μηνύματα και ν’ αποτελέσει ευθεία και δυνατή φωνή ενάντια στην εκδήλωση κάθε μορφής βίας και ρατσισμού.\n\nCan't remember another adventure game that features such caustic satire on real life phenomena of the era it's getting released. It tries to send various messages in all directions and become a strong voice against violence and racism events.\n\nhttp://www.ragequit.gr/reviews/item/supreme-league-of-patriots-pc-review","February 7, 2015","true","5.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"
