Even pony-mad kids are liable to find this unbearably dull if played for longer than five minutes.\n\nGraphics: Awful. Straight out of the mid-1990s.\n\nGameplay: Now I'm a reasonably intelligent adult but the lack of guidance as to how to play this god-forsaken excuse of a game is insane. There is no information on how to improve the horses skills, health, cleanliness, etc. There are a handful of tasks to complete, but nothing useful in the way of a tutorial. Is there even a help guide? If so, I couldn't find one.\n\nEntertainment Value: Okay, so the show element is vaguely entertaining, but for every 60 seconds of competition I can guarantee you another 10 minutes of walking. Yes. WALKING: endless leading of your horse back and forth from the paddock and stables will sap your will to live. Oh, and then there's the grooming. Horse cleanliness seems to plummet regardless of how long one spends on the utterly tedious process of waggling a brush around. No indication is given of how long is long enough, or if progress is being made. Literally hours of your game day will be spent on this task... and largely in vain.\n\nIn Summary: Run. Run away as fast as you can and take your money with you.","April 23, 2014","false","14.3"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","28","36","2","1"

I played this as a child, as many others disagree with the quality of the game, I am very happy with it. The game is way too dope to be hated on as such.\n\nGraphics: If you didn't like the graphics, then why buy it? You can tell it has lower graphics and is an old game. Honestly you're incredibly stupid if you wrote a bad review over the graphics.","February 23","true","1.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

What put me off was the animations of the horse and rider, when riding. To me, they were horrid to watch, and put me off playing the game. It did not help that the controls felt a bit clunky, and it felt really bland, and lifeless when playing the game. As a player of Equestrian games, I have to say that I cannot recommend this game to others who enjoy playing horse games. I know I have only played ten minutes of it, but I cannot stress this enough... I simply could not get over the bad rider/horse animations, and the clunky gameplay that came with it.","May 26","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
