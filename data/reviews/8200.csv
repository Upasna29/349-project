It broke my mind. The point where you have to discredit the renaimated statue of Abraham Lincoln by making him read "cue cards" and setting him up with a girlfriend... It killed my sanity.

The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. If you like point-and-click adventure games that are light-hearted and fairly well-polished with your typical point-and-click puzzle elements, then it is hard to go wrong with any Sam & Max game. These are really terrific to throw on a low-powered laptop and play while you're watching television or waiting at the airport or otherwise needing some simple distraction.","August 22, 2014","true","2.0"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","30","36","7","0"

I have played the other Telltale Games and even the original Sam & Max, and I adore this series. This first season is the weakest entry in the series, (with Devil's Playhouse contrastly being one of the best adventure games out there), but the series gets better and better with each episode. However, this does have a hard time running on Windows 10, and there is no patch for it from Telltale. If you don't feel like fixing the first two seasons yourself, at least go buy Season 3.\n\nFrom the excellent writing to the likable characters to the award-winning music to the excellent voice acting - including Roger Jackson of Powderpuff Girls and Scream fame - you can't miss this series. I love it, and a potential Season 4 is my most wanted sequel in gaming, (since Psychonauts 2 just got funded).\n\nEDIT: There IS a way to easily fix this on your Windows 10 computers! What you need to do is this...\n\n(credit to Kong)\n\nThe following is working for me with Season 2 on Windows 10:\n\nOpen the files folder for the game on your harddrive.\nBackup prefs.prop and all .save files.\nDelete those files from game folder.\n\nRun REGEDIT\nGo to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Telltale Games\Sam & Max Season 2\nModify Windowed from 0 to 1\n\nRun game. It should now be running windowed!\nI had to play through one episode in a very compressed Windows mode, but by the next I was playing at full screen again!\n\nIf you want full screen, follow this guide...\n\nStep 1 : You need to download and install Notepad++ from the following link:\nhttps://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/\n\n(NOTE - Didn't need to download Notepad, I had it already).\n\nStep 2 : Open up your Steam folder, by default it's in 'C:\program files (x86)\steam'. in the Steam folder you must go to '\steamapps\common' and there you must look for the 'sam and max' folders with the season and episode number behind it. Here you must open up the folder of one of the episodes that won't work for you.\n\nStep 3 : You might want to copy the 'prefs.prop' to a save place in case you break something in the next steps, but this is not required if you know what you are doing.\n\nStep 4 : Open the 'prefs.prop' for the Sam&Max episode that doesn't work for you by right clicking the file and selecting 'Edit with Notepad++' (or edit normally)\n\nStep 5 : The file opened will look unreadable at first and you must scroll the bar to the right to find the word 'Windowed' followed by the number 0. You could also use the Search option inside Notepad++ to locate this word. Now you only have to change the 0 to 1 and save the file. (In case there is no 'Windowed' in the file, rightclick the game in the library within Steam go to 'Properties', and then click on 'SET LAUNCH OPTIONS...' and enter -sw. Launch the game once, it will crash but the 'prefs.prop' should be altered and have 'Windowed0' in it again after opening it with Notepad++. after this remove the -sw from the launch options)\n\nStep 6 : Start the game, this is to check if the game runs in Windowed mode like it should. You can change the resolution to what you like, but never ever click the fullscreen option again or you will have to edit the 'prefs.prop' file once again.\n\nNow we can make the game run in Fullscreen using Borderless Gaming\n\nStep 7 : Install Borderless Gaming and start it (after you bought it offcourse). After that go to 'Options' and make sure it starts every time you start Windows by checking 'Run On Windows Startup'. You could also go to 'Tools' and click 'Disable Steam Hook' to make sure Steam won't tell you are in-App Bordelless Gaming all the time each time Borderless Gaming is launched.\n\nStep 8 : Start Sam&Max in Windowed mode and in under the Applications window in Borderless Gaming you will see 'Telltale Games' appear. Click on that and then followed by the arrow pointing to the right so 'Telltale Games' will be visible under 'Favourites (automatic)'. Rightclick 'Telltale Games' in here and make sure that 'Fullscreen' and 'Auto-Maximize' are checked.","October 8, 2015","true","4.4"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","5"

Fragmented episodes means each story can get plenty of attention without audio and voices being overly recycled. Laugh-out-loud musical numbers. The world changes as you progress through the episodes, so there are always new details to find. I appreciate the episodic approach in this so there were no temptations to recycle dialogue.\n\nCONS: The game does not like widescreen monitors. I had to restart my computer from the crashing twice before finding a way to get the episodes to boot in an undestructive fashion. This season was also extremely easy and offered very little challenge to neither a new point and click player nor a seasoned one.\n\nOVERALL: Despite being absolutely no challenge, there's something to be said about a game that can make you laugh this much with such hokey humor. For some reason, the Sam & Max hasn't been dated as I expected. This duo is a lovable spin on the Good Cop, Bad Cop shtick, with both character being surprisingly complex for what seems to be a one-dimensional comedy series. I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good laugh or is new to the genre.\n\nSCORE: 9/10","June 9, 2015","true","5.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","1"

And unlike many others, it used them with success, making TellTale produce more adventure games in similiar fashion. It also seems to be one of few games to be on Steam before it was cool.\nOh, and it doesn't support widescreen. Sorry folks, 2007 year and all.\n\nEpisodic model is also used in good and bad way, in a sense that you have common location and few common characters (outside of those that are unique to single episode) that keep reappearing in each episode. Sybil is most amusing, as she changes job every single episode. Such familiarity works nicely. But then, there are some negativity about it too, like, in the last episode you can suddenly pick up object that main hero refused to keep in all previous episodes.\n\nGraphics and music have style to them, even though they are a bit weak. Both of them. Well, or not so weak.\nFine, music is nice, but more of staying in the background. And graphics are fine for cartoonish style. Lacks some good shadows though. But hey, was designed for low-end machines back then.\n\nIt's quite usual old-schoolish point'n'click by gameplay and plot, following same mindset of "puzzles are the main point". Which isn't bad thing. Combined with expected humorous approach. Mature one even. You do get few hard puzzles that I am sure you would want to use at least some hints from the almighty Google. But at least you feel clever when solving some of harder ones, at least I did, when figured out Checksum puzzle.\n\nDid I mentioned humour?\nActually, characters interaction and humour is one of the best in when it comes to "old-school by being linear and humor-based", outdoing most of older titles.\n\nIt's a pretty nine series. Some may like it, some may not. Others will choke on rainbow bliss. From smiling too much.","June 11, 2015","true","3.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

At first I thought a point and click game would be boring, but as I started playing this game I found that it was actually very fun. Sam and Max is a great game to play when you want to play a casual, fun, humourous game. It has clearly defined characters and diaolgue that made me chuckle more than a few times. One of my favourite character's is Bosco of Bosco Inconvenients, his overprotectiveness and the funny conversations he had with Sam and Max made me laugh!

The puzzles are simplistic, the humor is simplistic. If you are looking for profound dialogue and/or puzzles, you will not be finding it in season one.\n\nI was not too surprised to find out that Sam and Max, like most other click adventures, have no re-playability. However, I was surprised to find how dull episode 1,2,3 is in this series. The three episodes are chock full of simple fedex delivery puzzles with esoteric solutions. Good luck solving them without a walk-through. Luckily the game does pick up it’s pace by episode 4, and the game took a turn for the best. Puzzles solutions remain esoteric, but the results of solving the puzzles can create quite amusing consequences. You also will not remain stuck at your boring ♥♥♥ apartment block which is a plus!\n\nTelltale nailed the voice acting in this series. Intentionally annoying characters have intentionally annoying voices; you will feel like punching the screen every single time the soda poppers talk. Humor is not universal, so the jokes in this game can either strike you as “ROFL” quality or downright immature. Luckily none of the jokes are nearly as stupid or overused as the ones you find in Duke Nukem Forever.\n\nI recommend this game solely on the basis that’s a very well polished click adventure with a unique brand of humor. It’s not immersive or challenging, but it does make for a fantastic change of pace in between long sessions of Elder Scrolls, Counter Strike, DOTA 2, etc.","March 7, 2013","true","1.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","3"

What we got from one of Taletale's earlier games is a bunch of moments that feel like Sam & Max after a long day of freelance crime-solving, and it's in 3D instead of Steve Purcell's lovely hand-drawn art style.\n\nThe writing is fairly funny, but most of the experience just feels flat or shallow - probably better off buying the complete series on DVD rather than playing a game based off of it. Plus, Sam's new voice is annoying to listen to compared to the original voice actor Harvey Atkin - shame they couldn't get him for these games.\n\nStill, even if the game, the acting, the puzzles, and the story doesn't always seem appealing, it's an enjoyable, quirky Point & Click adventure to blaze through.\n\nThe good news is that the writing improves slightly each season as well as the graphics. It's also amusing to see the same location altered due to the events of past game episodes as well as deviate to some new ones connected to the game's Main st.\n\n7/10: worth one playthrough, not much else.","December 17, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

What I love most about these games is they keep the humor, bring in new characters and they even have the origonal creator on standby to help with the development which I loved! Not to mention, the final villain is always a difficult one to discover.\n\nI believe that this was the series that put TellTale on the map and the fact that they even had the creator on board to help them with the game (much like how they had Michael J.

If you've ever read the comics, watched the cartoon or played Hit The Road back in the nineties, you've probably already hit the buy button.

Unsurprisingly, this is a fantastic means to adapt the comic, as nothing suits the series inane and black comedy humor so well.  The first season has plenty to do and see.  While there's nonexistent consequences for making a wrong choice, it's still pretty great to see all of the seperate choices and the dialogue as a result.\n\nPROS:\n\nFantastic adaption of the comic series.\nLots of well written dialogue and jokes with some references to the original series\nOriginal story line\n6 Episodes, all about 2-3 hours apiece, so about at least 12 hours total, depending on how fast you solve the puzzles.\nCONS:\n\nEach episode requires seperate settings, so you'll have to change them upon starting up.\nSam walks everywhere, which can be annoying at times (this is fixed in the second season)\nLike with any starting series, the first episode is perhaps the most flat, with the voice acting for the title characters being weirdly flat and unlike the characters. Things thankfully get under way following the next episode and from there things go off the rails as a good Sam and Max series should.\nLike most adventure games, the logic can be weird at times, with some solutions requiring things you didn't know you can use.  (So i suggest keeping EVERYTHING that you can comment on in mind).  This is of course debatable since most people can probably solve it faster than others.\nEach episode is technically a standalone game, so you're gonna have a lot of titles in your library if you install them all.\nI got the entire three seasons for 10 bucks, so i can't say whether or not it's worth it for regular price.  I can say it's worth getting if you enjoy black comedy or are a fan of the series.

Not even when the community has addressed the problem to developers and Valve (many cases can be found by googling). And these are not even that old games!\n\nLuckily the solution to get these Sam & Max games to work is simple this time: just set your screen resolution to 1028x960 or lower and the game launches fine to full screen. You can also try to be fast with Alt+Enter (to put the game in windowed mode) when you launch the game, but I found out that some of the objects and backgrounds weren't showing up properly this way.\n\nTelltale's Sam & Max games themselves are simplified classic point-n-click adventure games and I do recommended them for their humour and easy-going gameflow.","August 22, 2015","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

They've ALWAYS been great.  Since the BEFORE TIME (pre-interwebs.)\n\nThere's a very old definition of "(graphic) adventure game", also from the BEFORE TIME, that revolved around millions of items and dozens of commands and long hours of trying everything on everything.\n\nTHIS GAME IS NOT THAT.\n\nThis whole Telltale thing, Sam & Max Save the World (Season One) is a phenomenally produced game whose play isn't so brain bending annoying, and the humor and story is absolutely stupendous.  It's more like experiencing an animated comic book.  The set story and path to completion obviously hurts replay value, but this is a game that does not need it; same as the words in your favorite book not changing or the scenes in your favorite movie, one playthrough justifies all time and money spent.","July 23, 2011","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RobTon/recommended/8200/","RobTon","Röbton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RobTon/","122 products in account","This was a nice change to play from what Telltale puts out these days. Their old games focus more on a linear story, point and click adventure. Rather than having choices that changes the outcome of the game. The challenge here is to gather things and use logic(most of the time…) to find out what items and dialogue triggers what. and you have to do a lot or going back and forth between locations in the game.\n\nI had to resort to guides online multiple times, at first I thought I was getting stupid, but then I realized I’ve gotten spoiled by newer games. In the end it kinda took me back, and I rather enjoyed playing through it.\n\nI had NO knowledge or prior experience with Sam & Max apart from the Poker games from Telltale, so the terrible jokes(which I like…), references and the way they solve crime blew me away. Not recommended if you are after a “immersive and realistic” type of game.\n\nAs for the technical aspect, this is an old game. The engine is outdated and only supports 3 resolutions(at least it did for me, 1024x768 was the highest it would go), this game also ran at 40-50fps max. But it was nothing I really didn’t expect from a game this old, it still played nicely. But if you are running Windows 10 however, it seems like you aren’t gonna be able to play. The support section is filled with those complaints.\n\nSo all in all, a fun game series which takes me back, is packed with terrible jokes and references. And doesn’t cost much compared to what you get out of it.(If you aren’t on Win10 that is, then don’t bother…) So I recommend it a lot.","February 17","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xandrumbledore/recommended/8200/","xandrumbledore","Drumbledore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xandrumbledore/","59 products in account","I bought this game (starting with season 1) because i remember playing S&M first on floppy disks, then eventually on CD-ROM with Sam & Max: Hit the Road. I loved those games, and they are some of my favorites from that era of gaming. These games completely live up to that sense of adventure and whimsey. Never have i played a reboot of a series that so accurately captured the look and feel of the original, while adding new content to the series. If you were a fan of the games, or at least the point&click genre, from that time.. do yourself and favor and pick up this game. Also, i am a Windows 10 Pro x64 user, and have had no troubles running the game. Not sure what others' issues are, but i put the game's executable in compatibility mode with Vista and everything runs as smooth as hot butter running down Max's supple, yet firm, back.","December 18, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They've ALWAYS been great.  Since the BEFORE TIME (pre-interwebs.)\n\nThere's a very old definition of "(graphic) adventure game", also from the BEFORE TIME, that revolved around millions of items and dozens of commands and long hours of trying everything on everything.\n\nTHIS GAME IS NOT THAT.\n\nThis whole Telltale thing, Sam & Max Save the World (Season One) is a phenomenally produced game whose play isn't so brain bending annoying, and the humor and story is absolutely stupendous.  It's more like experiencing an animated comic book.  The set story and path to completion obviously hurts replay value, but this is a game that does not need it; same as the words in your favorite book not changing or the scenes in your favorite movie, one playthrough justifies all time and money spent.","July 23, 2011","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RobTon/recommended/8200/","RobTon","Röbton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RobTon/","122 products in account","This was a nice change to play from what Telltale puts out these days. Their old games focus more on a linear story, point and click adventure. Rather than having choices that changes the outcome of the game. The challenge here is to gather things and use logic(most of the time…) to find out what items and dialogue triggers what. and you have to do a lot or going back and forth between locations in the game.\n\nI had to resort to guides online multiple times, at first I thought I was getting stupid, but then I realized I’ve gotten spoiled by newer games. In the end it kinda took me back, and I rather enjoyed playing through it.\n\nI had NO knowledge or prior experience with Sam & Max apart from the Poker games from Telltale, so the terrible jokes(which I like…), references and the way they solve crime blew me away. Not recommended if you are after a “immersive and realistic” type of game.\n\nAs for the technical aspect, this is an old game. The engine is outdated and only supports 3 resolutions(at least it did for me, 1024x768 was the highest it would go), this game also ran at 40-50fps max. But it was nothing I really didn’t expect from a game this old, it still played nicely. But if you are running Windows 10 however, it seems like you aren’t gonna be able to play. The support section is filled with those complaints.\n\nSo all in all, a fun game series which takes me back, is packed with terrible jokes and references. And doesn’t cost much compared to what you get out of it.(If you aren’t on Win10 that is, then don’t bother…) So I recommend it a lot.","February 17","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
