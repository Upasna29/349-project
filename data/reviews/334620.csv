There simply isn't anything to keep you entertained in the long run.\nThe bots (on the highest difficulty) may seem like tough opponents untill you figure them out.\nThe 5 gamemodes are fun for a while but get boring pretty quick.\nThere's no online multiplayer.\nYou could ofcourse try to beat every achievement, which are very easy (Lose 200 times for example) but simply take a hell of a lot of time.\n\nOverall 'Soccertron' is a fun game IF you can find some friends to play locally otherwise I doubt you find this one interesting enough to keep playing.","February 5","false","10.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","1"

The game is so much better with a controller, it feels way more natural and less awkward to control. Instead of being a game of skitterish squirrels skating on slippery ice, it became a tight and easy to manuever elite soccer game. I really love this game now and so do my friends. This game requires skills and lots of luck, but it is really fun!\n\nWould definitely recommend :D","September 4, 2015","true","1.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

Yet is difficult enough that it does require a bit of skill.\nThe game does boast quite a bit of extra goodies. Steam Achievements/Cards, Full controller support. Decent AI Opponents.\nThe only thing that is missing from the game is multiplayer. Which the developer has already stated is planned and coming in the future. When and if that does arrive. It will take Soccertron to the next level!\nIn the meantime, enjoy this couch party game that is bound to be full of chaotic cheers and jeers.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/1Z9OkH4WJS4\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","March 12, 2015","true","1.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","12","16","3","0"

If you remember DOS times you might recall the game 'Arcade Volleyball' (1987) which was very popular as a casual time killer. 'Soccertron' is obviously a creative developement of that idea - several 'sports' added along with modern physics engine and neon graphics. Bots are smart and persistent, tricky situations arise every second and after you get used to character motion (much more sophistiicated than predecessor's) and controls the emotions flow like a river!\n\nЭто на первый взгляд примитивное многопользовательское развлечение удивило меня, оказавшись также прикольной одиночной забавой! Если помните времена ДОС, то, вероятно, вспомните игру "Волейбол для автоматов" (1987), которая была весьма популярна в качестве случайного убийцы времени. "Соккертрон" однозначно является творческим развитием той идеи - добавлены новые "виды спорта", а также современная физика и неоновая графика. Боты хитры и настырны, сложные ситуации возникают каждую секунду, и после того, как привыкнешь к движениям героя (гораздо более навороченным, чем у предшественника) и управлению, эмоции текут рекой!","November 4, 2015","true","11.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

It sort of reminded me of the oldschool game Slime Volleyball, and it seems like it's heart is in the right place, but it just isn't that good.\n\nI wish I had some constructive criticism for what could be done to make it better. I'd start with the physics- it's just too frustrating to try to hit the ball. On top of that it's way too hard to aim and get it into the goal. I thought volleyball was alright, but after trying it again I've decided that I don't think that's a redeeming quality either- once you lose one point, you're almost guaranteed to lose 2 or 3.\n\nIf I had to say something good about Soccertron it's that the menu system is easy to navigate. However, the game mode selection interface is too in-your-face big.\n\nI'm sorry, but I would have to say to avoid this game.\n\nOn a sidenote, I tried letting the computer play against an idle player and thought it was funny that the idle player won one of the games.","June 20, 2015","false","0.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krylo22/recommended/334620/","krylo22","Krylo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krylo22/","379 products in account","Simple and fun. It works either with friends or solo, as you can summon up to three AI members. Unfortunately however, the AI is set to a standard difficulty and struggles with certain game types, one of which it can barely play at all. AI also becomes a bit of a breeze as you gain some experience, making the "You lost 250 matches" achievement a painful grind for solo players (prepare to intentionally lose a LOT of games).\nAside from those issues it's a delight to play either alone or with friends. It controls and performs well, is easy to learn so you can jump into action, and has a pretty interesting neon-esque art style.\n\nI highly recommend using a controller for this title, and note you can use the left analog stick to direct the ball's trajectory before you kick it (I didn't figure that out initially).\n\nIf you're looking for bursts of fun for maybe 5-15 minutes at a time I suggest you give Soccertron a go. Just take note that for the price you might only manage 1-3 hours of gameplay as that seems to be the medium, but if you or your friends enjoy it, I anticipate roughly 8-10 hours of game time in getting all achievements.","December 11, 2015","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love couch co-op and versus, which is why I picked up this cheap title. Its fairly simple, there are several sports to play a la two or four-player style (1v1 or 2v2 volleyball, soccer, basketball, etc.). The problem is that it is very difficult to control the ball and actually be *good* at it.\n\nWe did not play all that long, but it was clear this was the case. There is more button-mashing than anything, really.\n\nPros:\n+Its cheap and has some cool ideas\n\nCons:\n-Physics is wonky enought that makes it really difficult to have control and not button-mash\n-Side-view sports are not really that fun, IMO\n-While there are several game modes - they all play out the same\n-No character customization or anything, just lots of neon colors\n\nI got it for half price, and still have buyer's remorse.","September 24, 2015","false","0.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","4","8","3","4"
