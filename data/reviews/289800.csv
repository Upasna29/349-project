This version has lots of things missing, and the puzzles autosolve when you click them. The trailer and screenshots on the store are NOT reperentative of this version.\n\n\n\nDracula: The Resurrection was, when it was first released on CDs, a great and creepy game for adventure fans. It was short and easy, but had a very good story and great graphics for the time. I was very excited when I've seen the Steam version, since the my original CDs are a bit old.\n\nBut something's wrong with this Steam version... For starters, the introduction prologue is gone! Yes, one of the best scenes in the game is nowhere to be found! Not only that, but the ending seems to be censored: a part of the ending has a scene missing...\n\nOther than that, this version has too many issues that SHOULDN'T be here: the videos are a LOT more grainy than the original ones, and they don't scale to widescreen monitors (however, in gameplay, the game DOES scale, making the transition from a cutscene to the gameplay very unnatural).\n\nOh, and all the puzzles in this version where simplified, and some of them actually auto solve when you click it.\n\nThe game itself isn't great. Like I said before, its VERY short and easy, it has a horrible voice acting, and a weird zoom-in effect when you transition from one screen to another. On the other hand its not a BAD game either. The storyline, while short, its VERY well told, the creepyness factor is very high (a must for a game based on the Dracula's lore). But this new version is VERY disappointing. It looks worse than the original version, has scenes missing, and don't have any new adition.\n\nReally not worth it. Better to try to find the old CD version (or even the GOG one).\n\n\nBTW, both the trailer and the screenshots on the store page are misleading. The trailer shows scenes that where removed from the game, and both the trailer and the screenshots shows the cutscenes in a widescreen format, something that this version doesn't support.","April 23, 2014","false","1.0"," 137 of 152 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","137","152","0","0"

It is the reason i like horror-adventure games and i would suggest you to buy with my eyes closed.... But unfortunately Steam version is AWFUL!!!  First of all, the great intro where you shoot Dracula is missing!!! Secondly, the dialogues and cinematics isn't on full screen as the original but windowed.... The graphics, the atmosphere and the sounds aren't that creepy as the old scary and full of emotions game... Also, the parts with the magnifying glass where you see some less important things of the game are missing too... But these aren't the worse! On steam version you can see exactly where there are items to grap, where you need to use items, so you have only to move your mouse and find where to use the right item, something that makes the game very very easy.... On the original game i spent many hours to find all items or where you need to use them something that here is obvious... Finally, you can see where to use an item only if the item is available to grap right now... On the original you could see that somewhere you should use an item you don't have either if you hadn't found it cause you were careless (something that can't happen now cause you see exactly where the items are!) either if you will find it later.... As you can see then you were confused if you should return back to find a lost item behind or if you will find it later so you should focus your attetion somewhere else (something that made the game more difficult)!  For all these reasons i would suggest you to buy the original game on PS or PC, otherwise buy this on sale!  My rate for the original game is surely 8,5-9 cause it's great but for this one will be lower....\n\nMy rate for this game is:  6,5/10","July 30, 2014","false","2.2"," 43 of 50 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","43","50","0","1"

There was a version for the Mac and the price seemed very reasonable. Once the game downloaded I eagerly clicked "Play" and waited to see the game start.\nThe intro was a lot shorter then I was expecting, seems the opening cutscene is from the remade touch compatible version but I didn't mind as it only got the action starting a little quicker.\nThe graphics were very nice, the controls took a little getting used to and I spent a few moments spinning like a top before I worked out how sensitive the controls were.\nStill on with the game. I spotted an inn and went inside, a lovely cutscene of the Barkeep starts up and then I'm left in the inn to explore. Except there wasn't anything to explore.\n\nNo flashing icons to move, talk to anyone, pick anything up. I figured I must have entered too early and I need to go somewhere outside to trigger more chat. I turned around and there was no hotspot. I spent several minutes moving the pointer over every inch of every part of the Inn looking for anything, something that I could interact with. Nothing.\n\nI restarted the game and went exploring, I could go to other places but they were all either locked or blocked by a character who just told me to move along. Back I went to the Inn and again no hotspots.\n\nI got a little annoyed with the game at this point and went to look for a full walkthrough to see exactly what I had to to do move the story along. They all said the same things, talk to this character and pick up this item. I tried 5 or 6 walkthroughs and didn't get a step further along in the game.\n\nI turned to the support forum for steam and it seems the mac version is broken. It does surprise me that Steam would release a game that is known to be unplayable on a particular OS. Why not just not have a Mac version if it doesn't work. It would certainly make the userbase happier not being sold something that doesn't work.\n\nIn short if you have a Mac don't even dream of buying this or the rest of the trilogy, they aren't Mac compatible in any way.\nWhich seems odd given that this version is ported from the iPad.\n","April 30, 2014","false","0.3"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","41","49","0","0"

And one inparticular for me was game breaking and prevented me for finishing the game as I clicked on something before I should have. Then when I went to 'load game' to restart the section I was unable scroll through the chapters. The game is simply poorly coded / not tested thoroughly. Particuarly noticable as the bugs get worse towards the end.\n\nIn summary this is a great point and click game worth playing but definately not this version until it is patched. As far as I know GOG has the classic trillogy, so if you cant wait I would advise going with their version.","October 29, 2014","false","2.7"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

The graphics are very dated but what do you expect from a game that was released 15 years ago..\n\nThe game play is your run of the mill point and click game, it's not the most difficult point and click game around, nor are the puzzles terribly difficult....  The story is fairly straight forward and appears to be a loosely based sequal of the Dracula books.   Jonathon Harker makes his way to Translyvania to rescue his wife, who is under Dracula's spell...\n\nI remember playing and beating this game back on my original playstation, the game is nearly identical except for some missing bits and pieces.. (see below).  If you are a fan of classic games and can get around some of it's shortcomings this wouldn't be the worst game you could pick up...  although\n\nHere goes why I gave this game a thumbs down.  I personally can't recall the missing scenes or cut content as I played the game 15 years ago, but many other users claim content was cut from this game (the introduction and a sequence near the end).. Content which is present in other releases including the copy you can buy from another website for less money.  Selling incomplete version of a game at a more expensive price point is just flat out ludacris..\n\nI'd recommend holding off on buying this particular version of the game, atleast until the missing content is reattached to the game, or you find it at a price point which is too good to pass up.","August 26, 2015","false","4.2"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","24","29","2","0"

It's a fun, if short, Myst like adventure game with beautiful graphics and a intresting storyline that follows up on Bram Stoker's novel.\n\nHowever, these postives are for the CD version of the game. The steam version seems to be a bad port of the IOS version with over simplistc controls that are still somehow confusing, lots of cut videos (inculding, most unforgivably the intro video, witch is still in the trailer...) and what videos that still in the game are in a small frame rather than in full screen like the CD version.\n\nAnd worse of all the game is broken. At one point a door that you need to go through to continue is locked and there is nothing you can do to unlock it thus making the game uncompletable.\n\nAs I say D:TR is a good game but you would need to track down the CD version to experince it as this version is a broken mess.","August 10, 2014","false","1.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

Theoretically it falls under the Myst umbrella of games aka heavy focus on puzzles and first person perspective as opposed to more classical P&C adventures, but everything else aside from oppressive and well done atmosphere is just very bare bones. From a scant handful of characters you'll barely interact with to a flimsy excuse of a plot you'll just be going through the motions, which hasn't exactly helped my initial confusion. They've done something to this version of the game on a level I don't fully comprehend. Puzzles appear to be cut and cinematic outcomes of your brainstorming, most of which are just really really simple, are simply strung together to facilitate this change.\n\nGiven this state of the game I cannot really recommend it. Play the original or PS1 version if you really want the proper experience instead of this one.","March 9, 2015","false","2.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I'm not much of a gamer but I remember playing this game on the PS1 and enjoyed it.  So having seen it on Stream I thought it'd be nice to be nostalgic and thought this Steam game would be optimised and run better for Windows 8.1.\n\nMy advice is this, don't waste your money on the Steam version.  Purchase it from GOG.com because the Steam version is a very, very poor port and the interface is appalling.  The GOG.com version is much truer to the original.\n\nNot only that, but I got stuck on the library locked door bug, which appears to be common with this version.  I did manage to get past this bug the next day but that was only because I loaded it from a previous save, spoke to an NPC character and solved some other puzzles in a different order to what the guide had prompted.  Whilst the arrows indicating where to go on screen were helpful (as I recall the original navigation being a bit more confusing) the inventory menu is bland.  In fact all the menus look pretty shoddy.  This version doesn't do the original any justice at all!  I also read afterwards that this version has been heavily censored and I noticed that there were a lot of cut scenes missing, which confused me greatly when I was following a guide for the parts I was stuck on.  However other versions don't appear to suffer from the extreme censorship.\n\nI will recommend that you give this game series a go if you like point and click puzzle games because it's quite enjoyable.  Just don't buy this version.","February 10, 2015","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
