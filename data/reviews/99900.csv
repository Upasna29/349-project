"http://steamcommunity.com/id/O_m_C/recommended/99900/","O_m_C","(OmC(","http://steamcommunity.com/id/O_m_C/","618 products in account","This little onlinegame was once a really good one. It had a really nice developer team with friendly gamemasters, a community which was always fun to have a chat with. Regular content updates with bug fixes, where the developers often listened to feedback. New game modes, new levels... but: these times are all over, and I must WARN you about this game.\n\nIt started with the acquisition by Sega at the end of 2011. The guys at Three Rings said, there won't be any changes because of this. It was the first lie, because of Sega, there were suddenly EU servers. Although this was positive, everything went VERY slowly downhill since this. I'm not going to cover much gameplay elements, because these are available in other reviews.\n\nA few weeks later in November 2011, they have released a content update with recycled boss levels, which are very same, but only harder. What's the catch? Per level, you needed a "shadow key", and it was findable as a 1% drop in lockboxes, something where you had to spend 2$/€/whatever to open one (if you wanted to of course). For a 1% chance. The community responded by a massive protest, saying that everyone should boycott this. Especially because the developers never did such a rip-off before. One week later, the shadow keys were available for "a limited time", for an energy price of 1800, something around more than 6$. The following weeks they were permanently added for purchase. This was not to be the first money try controlled by Sega.\n\nThe next "big" thing was in 2012 a new boss level added as a DLC, for purchase with a 7$ fee. Once again many community members were upset about this, since they had released in 2011 three whole boss and many other levels for free. Although you may say, "but they need to earn money too!", you may be right, but this was abused by an increasing money greed by Sega, slowly completely ruining the future and meaning of the game. I will shorten the next events in 2012: After several other cash grab attempts, the most hilarious attempt happened at the end of 2012. It was the guild hall update, and seriously EVERYTHING was overexpensive. Only people with 24 hour free time, farming the same repetitive levels 100 times per day, or 3 - 4 digit number wallets had the pleasure to burn their cash, or better said, to customize your own guild hall.\n\nMeanwhile, Sega had found out that people don't like DLCs. They like costumes! Which means, the development for all other stuff like from their view pointless things like content updates are completely throttled, and costumes were released and updated regulary, sometimes several times in a month. Usually one costume box was available for "free" if you purchased energy for more than 20$. Later these boxes were available for energy as well, but on the same real-money level.\n\nIn December 2012, Three Rings had announced the Battle Sprites, little pets which are a nice help in a battle, but not really necessary. The community was hyped. 7 months later, in July 2013, they had finally released the Battle Sprites. What happened in the meantime? Nothing at all, only tons of cash promos with even more costumes. Please note, most costumes aren't something new. They were simple reskins, a cheap color change. Even a 12 year old could achieve this in programs like Paint.net or Gimp with a few clicks. More about these Battle Sprites: If you get your first one for free, the Sprite is level 1, and completely useless. You can level it up until level 100, but this will take a develish amount of time, if you aren't planing to level it up the rest of your life. Here grins the cash grab again: There were plently of purchaseable items to speed up the progress. Veteran players which had a lot of minerals and materials by previous level missions had the best chances to avoid the cash grab as good as possible on their way to level the poor Sprite up to level 100. And there are the next things to facepalm about:\n\nThe Battle Sprites are completely unbalanced. The Dragon, which was meant to be an offensive Sprite, is ridiculously weak. The half-offensive-defensive Ghost Sprite has more offensive powers and damage.\n\nEven the defensive Cat Sprite is better than the Dragon, because the skill "Heart Attack" makes it much easier for you to spam your own attacks, if there are heart pickups everywhere. Major balance problems like this aren't fixed; it's still the same today! And there are no signs that they care about this, or the developers are not allowed to care about it. Gameplay bugs, glitches or balance problems have a pathetic high chance to be completely ignored at all, which wasn't the case in 2011. Today they will only issue an emergency patch when one of their cash "promos" stuff has a little texture bug, glitch, or whatever. It became very obvious that it's all about new cash stuff and costumes now, and many veteran members have left the game because of this situation. This online game has too little content to live without content updates, these were an important reason for many people to stay. And since these people have left the game, there are now only these left which think the current situation is perfectly okay and everything is great. Which is another problem:\n\nWhile you had in 2011 a lot of people free for an adventure or a chat, this is today only partially the case anymore. Many people have developed their own closed-circle-connections in their guilds, like to talk or blaspheme about other people, because of boredom or whatever reasons (I can confirm this with the German community, English could be different). Since there are no new content updates anymore, except one or two simple short missions in ONE year, some people stay there for Social Engineering. The game supports Steam trading, where you could trade energy for games, items from other online games items or more. Which is very attractive for some people. But I have kept the best to the last:\n\nIn early months of 2014, someone has hacked the game, and has duplicated items in auctionhouse or had gifted them to other people (as far as I could see it on the forums before it got censored away). They have banned almost everyone who has purchased or accepted such duplicated items in the auctionhouse or via trade, and how are we and other people supposed to see if a virtual item is actually "real" or not (since when are virtual items real anyway?). A friend of mine got such items via a trade, and he gave me some to me and a few guildmates too, because free things are always good, isn't it? From their view obviously not. Many others, including me, got banned in a massive ban wave, with hundreds of other people, and they absolutely don't care about it, nor my massive amount of playtime or invested money. I had contacted their support, which said, "We require a healthy mind from every player", refusing to take off the ban, and indirectly saying I'm a liar. But they´re the liars they already knew about that bug for weeks and didn´t fix it.\n\nTheir gamemaster staff became like "brainwashed", handling situations for their profit. In 2011 they have never thought about crazy things like a massive ban wave, just because one bad guy set a fire in the game (metaphorical). It was a time where they have cared about their people very intensively, if people were actually happy about the game progress. And it's all over. No active content development, no mature and friendly community anymore, no new things, no hope at all. This game is for every interested gamer a hopeless case now if you want to play it for a long time. Because Sega treats Spiral Knights like a cashcow, milking it's milk til it's blood and bones. No wonder why one of their lead designers called Nick left Three Rings this year. It was once a very promising and great game, until Sega came in. I could extend this long text even more, but I will stop now.\n\nThanks for reading!","October 11, 2014","false","347.5"," 1,728 of 1,891 people (91%) found this review helpful 70 people found this review funny","91","728","1","70","101"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sw0rdcyclon3/recommended/99900/","sw0rdcyclon3","Speedkillerr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sw0rdcyclon3/","33 products in account","I'VE PLAYED THIS GAME FOR 5000 HOURS SO I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT\n\nAnd by the way, if it's too long to read there is no point to play it: The Game's servers are going to close. So recommending or not, there is no reason to start it whatsoever (it has not been confirmed, but its on forums).\n\nI would definetely give this game a thumbs up, but for its current state, it's a no from me. I don't wanna hate on the game, but what bugs me the most are the developpers that gave up on this game that it had the potential to be something bigger and something everyone would enjoy playing. I would give this review a thumbs up, but I'm giving a thumbs down because of the devs. And before you trynna defend in the comments before reading this, I suggest you do. I've spent 5000 hours on this game,more than any other I've spent and you cn definetely say I enjoyed it A LOT. But I feel like I got betrayed. It would be a 10/10 if the game was active and constantly had new things to offer.\n\nYou might definetely know me if you played this game as Speedkillerr, technically still a Guild Master in Unity(an old powerfull guild). I've also made yearly Christmas Giveaways to the ENTIRE GAME! YES, I used to advertise in haven for free stuff, and over 40 people would line up to give free items to friends and strangers. So before concidering me as an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, make some research or stop assuming. To introduce you to this game, you are a knight and you must find a core, where a really old artifact was stolen by the Gremlins(a destructive enemy faction), and you must bring it back to Haven. Your Mission is also to help Spiral HQ to find the missing Alpha team that got sucked into the core. Unfortunately, the game never had the core open until few months ago and boy...the lore was disappointing. So if you are looking for story, you will not find it interesting as the gameplay progresses. Only As a 1-star player or a recruit, the story will be enjoyable.\n\n\nHere is the positive part: I loooooove the costumes and the design of characters. It gives so much inspiration to designers and drawers out there. The designing part of the game is friendly. Spiral Knights on DeviantArt is a really common place for players to go. I've changed my profile picture in the past A LOT when I would find a badass or cool spiral knights pic. I even make em myself using Spiral Spy, Three Ring's software. I've made profile pictures for many friends and other peeps. I love the design and costumization of the game a lot.\n\nWhat's really nice about this game is also Haven. It looks such an ideal and peaceful place for players to interact, trade, participate in events, practise, generally become better players. The design of the Town Square looks amazing and delightful! If you are going to start the game, I recommend to look around and explore the place. No wonder why most of people stay there most of their time!\n\nThe mobs-monsters are inspiring as well. Dividing them into different families and each faction-family has its own unique story and species. Personally, "the nightmare" mobs are my favourite (shadow zombies, gremlins, trojans, etc).\n\nThe game isn't challenging for you? Try out Shadow Lair! It's epic and has a lotta action!\n\nI am also glad to see new accessories lately in early 2016. I can definetely say the design has improved A LOT. Variety expanded. But if I rant about it bellow, it's for not just that reason. The lack of new items is still a debate.\n\nSadly,the game is dead. I'm repeating, the game is dead. Only 500 users playing on steam. Now you're going to tell me that steam users only populate 30% of the game, but still...it is not enough. The developpers don't care about this game anymore. Some devs were playing the game and doing nothing all day. Just showing off their expensive ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items that no one can afford. The Head-Dev of the game(Nick) quit. The are almost no updates in the game.\n\nLet's break this into two pieces now. 1-for PvE and 2-for PvP\n\n1) Missions get repetitive, there are only 5-10 daily missions that are randomely generated. Arcade depths are empty since there is a "Mission" option where you get straight into the lore. There is no variety into the missions, that's just how I felt through out the years. Since most of the game is filled with players who finished the lore and are 5-star, the Lord Vanaduke mission is the primary selection for grinding, which is the only one that gives the most crowns(currency of the game). And yes,it's just THAT mission that you get the most money from. And it definetely gets repetitive since it's the only one that shows progress. And it takes about 30-40 minutes to complete. Either way, PvE is boring, that's all I'm gonna say,especially when you're alone.\n\n2) The worst part of this game. Basically 99% of the game is PvP. Classic. It's called Lockdown. You just get in 2 teams and kill each other andcapturing points. OP people always playing, you see no noobs anymore. And basically the people who play PvP excessivly are the ones who live at their mom's basement and don't have anything else to play. It can be fun at some parts, but it's repetitive and BORING. More boring that Call of Duty nowadays. And everyone is using the same TWO weapons.  That's basically PvP. No variation in this game. There is also Blast Network but it has 0 players for 3 YEARS STRAIGHT. I've never seen anyone playing it. Whenever there is a match, it's surprising. It's like the most useless PvP part of the game. You just bomb others.\n\nThe prices of the items are broken. The Auction House is empty. Nothing is sold anymore, I only see 2-3 traders a day, while back in the days, there were trades everywhere. There are rarely new items anymore. Just some promo ♥♥♥♥♥♥ costumes that only difference they have is their color. NOTHING ELSE. That's what we get twice a year only.\n\nBIG problem in the game nowadays is the wealth gap. Now it's just rich vs poor. No in between. It's like the players have been divided in two species. The rich people monopolize everything. The bad thing also is that only 2-3 guilds are active. And the really big ones are literally ruining the game. Guild vs Guild PvP only has ONE guild which you can play against. ONE! And this one is the most hated to VS since they don't even let you play with others..and they are incredibly tryhards lol. My guild tried to vs with a friendly guild. And we didn't manage to play because that annoying guild gets in the way.\n\nNo joke, the game was full and joyfull back in 2012. It reached its climax in 2013. The servers were full. There was action going on, and the community was humble. Now it's all about competition and who is the best on LD(Lockdown). Servers are empty. There is only 1 server active and sometimes it is empty as well.\n\nThe game had full potential to become something new and different. I liked the lore and the setting at one point, but the devs don't care anymore and half of the quit. Three Rings is falling and there is nothing we can do about it. The 2 biggest guilds in the game broke and went to other games.\n\nIt used to be my favourite game for a loooong time, but it got boring. You only enjoy it for a small tangent of time. Then you will hate that you got consummed by it.\n\nThis ain't just a rant, it's the players' voice. It's not just my voice, it's everyone's complaints,pros and cons in just a compressed and really brief review of the game. I don't like hating on things, because I'm not able to make a game like that myself, but knowing that the developers aren't in a good shape and kinda gave up on the game, made me feel betrayed.\n\nWant a simpler one?: DO NOT touch this game if you don't like repetitiveness. Good thing it's free, so you can just try it out yourself. I play it sometimes because I wanna hang out with friends, there are some personal parts that keep me going,\n\nPeace out, here is a smiley face if you managed to read this vicious text  :)","December 17, 2015","false","257.9"," 741 of 851 people (87%) found this review helpful 125 people found this review funny","87","741","851","125","142"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cid_incognitus/recommended/99900/","cid_incognitus","cid_incognitus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cid_incognitus/","138 products in account","I suppose it might be time for me to write this review, considering I've played since shortly after it became available on Steam. Granted, I've taken some pretty lengthy breaks, but I've logged quite a few hours into this game.\n\nTL;DR: A personally nostalgiac MMO that isn't quite what it used to be.\n\nWhen I started playing this game, I pretty much played solo. There were no missions, nor was the story something you had to experience along the way - back then, all it took was learning the mechanics and diving into it. It was pretty grindy back then, but definitely manageable. As a new player, and with content being released a little more regularly then, grinding consistently paid off. If that were still the case, I'd probably recommend this game.\n\nI got about halfway through levelling up my first set of gear when I realized how quickly things would go if I were in a guild. My first guild experience lasted a day, and I hopped through a few smaller ones until I found my first home. I'm glad to say that a few people from that guild I'm still friends with in real life - and honestly, there are only a handful of MMOs that have actually brought people into my life for an extended period of time outside of game. I suppose that adds to the nostalgia. I got a little more levelled up in that guild, but my interest started to fade and I stopped playing.\n\nWhen I started again, I hopped around a few more times, settling in for a month or two with some relatively active guilds, but didn't find another in-game group that I clicked with until I joined my current guild. Again, I still keep in contact with several guild mates to this day, not as often lately but it's nice knowing they're there and that they helped me through a time in my life that was a bit troubled. I reached end game with them, and started to feel the interest fade, as well. The mission system took some of the mystery out of the game, but that wasn't too bad. Then energy was replaced with crystals, and the game essentially became pay-to-win. A lot of people stopped playing.\n\nThe community in this game has always been one of its strong suits, something that would be a definitive selling point so long as it thrived. However, I don't really see it thriving like it used to. Sure, I have friends that play still, and there are many other great people online pretty regularly. I could go on and on with examples about how changes have impacted the community, though - when I started playing, random clusters of players just chatting away was a regular sight in the more common areas. I don't see that as much now. A lot of community talk has gone from focusing on lore or gameplay elements to constant wondering when something new will happen with the game.\n\nOverall, I concur with what many other reviews say. The Zelda-esque gameplay is really appealing, and the art, both audio and visual, is unforgettable. Yet it has lost its charm. For new players, getting to end-game would take a lot of time or money, or both, and even then, what good does it do? While the journey to the end itself is quite fun, and there is an opportunity to meet some great people along the way, there isn't much to expect after. Even as a completionist, I've pretty much given up on levelling all of my gear - it just doesn't seem worth it, and at this point, things are too repetitive.\n\nDo I recommend this game? A few years ago, sure, but now, I sadly cannot. If that changes, I'll be sure to update my review, but I'm not counting on it.\n\n\nEDIT: In response to comments questioning how I can dislike a game that I put 1100+ hours into, the answer is this. I actually was quite fond of the game for several years, and during that time, yes, I played it a lot. The game has had many updates (and I do agree that some of them were for the better, especially allowing people to play more without waiting. The energy revamps were much needed), yet the missions system and energy change was, in my opinion, the last "great" update to the game. Considering the grindiness that the game currently has, I don't consider it welcoming to new players in the sense that the game is fun for quite a while, and then becomes rather repetitive and frustrating.\n\nTo be fair, the game was *always* repetitive and frustrating - the difference, at least for me, is that at one point it was fun enough that I didn't mind, and now, with a lack of additional content (we've been at the core for a while now and only recently got a glimmer of hope that we'd move deeper into the world), it's less fun and more "I'm playing this game because I used to play this game."\n\nIs this review biased? Of course it is, I logged over a thousand hours into the game. Needless to say it had an impact on my life. I'm definitely grateful for those hours, but I won't simply recommend it to everyone based on the fun I had a couple years ago - especially since the game has become less fun for me. The game will always have a special place in my memory - I just can't say with certainty that it would be anywhere near the same for someone just starting out now. Take from that what you will.\n\n---\n\nAnd to clear things up for anyone looking for a concise list of pros/cons, here you are:\n\nPROS:\n\nCaptivating gameplay\nGear is upgraded, not the character, so there is replay value\nContent is interesting\n\nCONS:\n\nGrindy / Repetitive\nLatest additions are mostly cosmetic, occasional fleeting hope for more content\nPVP is difficult to get into without a lot of great gear\nGame has become, in essence, P2W.*\n\n*Totally possible to win without paying, but takes a considerable amount of grinding.","June 16, 2015","false","136.3"," 390 of 500 people (78%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","78","390","500","40","24"

I played back when the game had a much more appealing idea behind it and wasn't 100% reliant on Promos to keep it alive.\n\n\nNow honestly what can be said about this game that hasn't already. From its core it was a very promising game. Frequent updates, fun gameplay, and interesting lore are what made this game so great from the very start. The majority of that changed for the worse when accessories were implemented as it gave the developers a false ideal that accessories are what should keep the game a float instead of pure content that most other games thrive off of to survive. For the most part the game in itself was a great one from the start, but with every level, every floor, every depth you went down further it started to lose the magic that it once had. It became less of a challenge for the player and just ended up turning into a limitless grind to see who could have the best looking set overall. Cosmetics can be nice and mix things up in games, but when that game survives off of that simple factor alone then it is truly not going to last forever. This game could have been something special if it truly didn't rely on cosmetics and reskins to keep it going.\n\nI may have a great deal of a time in this game, but it took me much longer than it should have to truly realize how the devs were handling it after countless promo that managed to root itself in with every event. On its own the gameplay stands out, it's fun whether you enjoy solo play (only for so long), and can be even better when you have a party of friends to play with, but you will quickly lose all enjoyment that you originally had once you reach the end-game content as it doesn't have much to offer other than reskinned bosses with extra challenge added to them. Other than the never-ending grind that presents itself for end-game there truly is no goal afterwards as it gives you nothing to strive for.\n\nFor what it is the soundtrack is great, and can easily be memorable if you happen to enjoy calm tunes when relaxing in Haven or enjoy dramatic music when engaging in battle. The graphics are also quite nice with how everything seems to be made to appear cute, but at the same time present some sort of danger. The community (although much smaller now) also happens to be a pretty good part of what makes the game what it is (except the PvP part of it. You know who you are). Other than that the only true flaw that makes me not want to recommend this game is that the devs have basically given up on putting out any true content updates, and mostly focus on reskins and cosmetics like most F2P models fall victim too.\n\nI can’t say I’d ever go back to this game either since it lost all of its charm as soon as I started playing other games and noticed the only real reason I originally played it was due to a nostalgic feeling that it gave. For the most part it reminded me of Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, and when I had first started this seemed like a wonderful experience since this was what I thought I was missing out on especially since it had co-op functionality.\n\nAll - in - All great idea, and interesting mechanics, but the devs have basically become greedy, and have chosen to take the lazy route only to release cosmetics that add no value to the game other than making it another bland dress-up game to see who has the most valuable and shiniest sets.\n\nTL:DR This game is decent, but like most F2P games it has its flaws, and won’t last you too long for enjoyment if you want a truly memorable experience.","January 29, 2015","false","804.6"," 203 of 259 people (78%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","78","203","259","22","16"

Wearing armor and items while you complete levels allows you to gain EXP (Known as Heat) to further level the items to a maximum of level 10. From there you can transmute and pick different branches that you want to evolve your weapon for a cost of in-game currency.\n\nThe game used to employ a revive system where you would share your HP to revive them, and uses now items known as Spark of Life.  The game used to be much more limited in terms of how much you could play per day, your Knight would store "Mist Energy" in their armor as time passes, and you could use this energy to power the Elevators (which help you advance to lower dungeons in the specific dungeon series).\n\nThe dungeons in general are randomly generated based on user contributions to that specific elevator, by adding different crystals (which you can find in almost every level), you may influence how the next dungeon will be generated.  EDIT: I have been told that such is not the case anymore.\nI believe it is a nice addition to the randomness of the stages, and it forces you to be prepared for the dungeons you go into.\n\nThe netcode is rather solid, I have not had many problems with my connection and playing the game, aside from the occasional lag spike between other players.\n\nThe themes and atmosphere are well designed, and the music compliments said environments.\n\nAll in all I would very much recommend this game to my friends and family, even though my opinion may be unpopular.","June 20, 2014","true","46.3"," 129 of 162 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","129","162","0","8"

It has a nice Zelda style gameplay, good design and art, plus a good crafting system and auction house and all that kind of stuff. The problem is the game just gets outright redundant before too long. The variety of the missions and the maps in the depths leaves a ton to be desired. After awhile it also becomes clear that there isn't as much weapon variety as you may have thought, and there are some weapon and armor combos that simply overpower others making many of them pointless.\n\nThe biggest problem is that while many MMO's deal with content issues early, they continue to develop and expand the game as time goes on. The issue here is that Three Rings has hardly developed a thing in the many years since the game came out. A few maps and missions have come in, but overall the story and main questing route all stalls exactly where it has since the very beginning. They're really good at developing new prize boxes to get people to pay real money for the chance of getting some rare cosmetic item, but development of the actual game has seemingly outright stalled. This last big update they hyped for quite awhile took over a year to come out and really just consisted of a few new guns and a couple new pieces of armor.\n\nSpiral Knights is just a great example of a good game and a good concept losing its steam due to mismanagement and greed. If they cared as much about making progress on their game as they did about finding new ways to get people to spend cash on prize boxes then their game might have a larger playerbase and they wouldn't need to stoop so low to milk the cash cow. I'd love to see this game get back on its feet as I enjoyed the content it did have, but I just don't see that happening until the developer starts to care again. When all is said and done the game is dead now.","December 25, 2014","false","526.0"," 197 of 262 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","197","262","6","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dasspooky/recommended/99900/","Dasspooky","Das Spooky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dasspooky/","129 products in account","What used to be a flourishing indie game inspired from some of gaming's best retro is now a shell of it's former self. Spiral Knights was fun when it was under indie ownership and it was still great when Nick was leading the development team. He left with a somber note and now I see why; the developer is clearly more interested in adding grind walls to get money out of it's players than it is providing a fun and balanced gameplay. RIP Spiral Knights, SEGA ruins yet another good thing.\n\nGood night sweet prince.\n\nEDIT: READ ON FOR AN ACTUAL REVIEW, STILL DON'T PLAY THIS GAME.\n\nSpiral Knights started out as an indie game developed and funded by Three Rings (simply called OOO from here on). It got many rewards and was lauded by critics cause of it's fun and unique playstyle for an MMO and easy to learn, hard to master approach. Like many games it has dual economy; in game money being >crowns< and the real world alternative >crystal energy<.\n\nFor a short while, one could easy get energy crystals from simply playing the game to earn crowns which they could then trade for EC. This worked for a while and it was very fair way for players to get the premium gear and goodies the game had to offer without ever needing to spending actual cash. The game did, however, limit how much you could play in a single day with MIST ENERGY, which you used to progress down floors into game's dungeons. You could get about an hour or so of play time of your 100 daily mist energy, so it was good incentive to buy an elevator pass so you could play the game as much as you wanted. For small price of $5.95, you could play the game for as much as you wanted for as long as you wanted (see how I racked up 2000+ hours?).\n\nThe game always had balance issues but with enough practice, you could overcome them. Swordsmen had the best selection of armor and weapons, dished out the most damage and had the most of the game's content dedicated to it. Gunners were gimped by poor damage output, a 3 bullet clip, and reduced movement speed when firing. Bomber probably had the worst of it all. Bombs take what feels like an eternity to charge, and you can only place down one bomb at a time. The blast radius was embracing unless you had a 4* or 5* weapon and even then, you were at large risk of dying because of how bombs functioned.\n\nDid I mention they teased opening the Core for years?\n\nThings started to turn sour, though, once SEGA purchased the developer. Content started to slow to a halt, and a steady increase in cosmetic promotions were now the common flavor of the month. SEGA, of course was more interested in milking the game's acclaim for cash rather than developing upon it's success as a wonderful, retro gaming-inspired masterpiece. It took almost a year for the guild hall update to finally release and it took even longer for Gunner Update to hit the players. In between that, there was dozens of promotional boxes featuring nothing but armor and weapon recolors and underwhelming chances of getting said items. It was a skinner box idea to start with that only got worse, as at this point in the game, the promo boxes didn't even provide the player with EC.\n\nThere were two nails in the coffin for this game: the first being the addition of the Furnace and the departure of head developer/game creative director Nick Popovich. This game was a love letter of gaming for Nick and it really showed. Sadly, he left on a subtly sad note and moved on with his life.\n\nIt was clear at that point that SEGA was simply using the game was means of collecting easy cash off of young people with no knowledge of how their gambling--erm--lockboxes work. rather than make an evolving game. OOO is now a money machine for SEGA and nothing else. The Furnace turned the game into an nigh painful grindfest and it's god awful at it too. "Heat" up your gear now and spend rare fire crystals at a chance at leveling up your gear.\n\nDo yourself a favor, if you see this game in your recommended feed by Steam, click "Not Interested" and said yourself the wasted harddrive space.\n\n.... oh, the core finally opened up. Big whoop.","February 3, 2015","false","243.6"," 153 of 198 people (77%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","77","153","198","11","7"

Over the course of the two years I've played this game, I've gone from having a lot of hope for it and being really excited to see how it develops, to being sorely disappointed with the quality of the updates and actually feeling sad for all the squandered potential the game had.\n\nLet's get into details now shall we?\n\nPositives:\n- Gameplay\nPretty unique in its gameplay. Haven't seen any other MMO that plays quite like it. A good take on translating the top-down Legend of Zelda style play and turning it into an MMO. It's easy to understand and play, with some advanced techniques to pick up along the way.\nThe randomly generated levels also add a bit of replayability to the game.\n- Sound\nThe music for the game is pretty good. Though generally upbeat and calm, it can get hectic or atmospheric when it needs to.\nThe sound effects are also pretty decent and add a lot of character to the colorful cast of enemies you'll find yourself beating down.\n- Art\nThe absolute biggest positive of the game in my opinion. Virtually every art asset is well designed and rendered in a very unique and eyecatching style. They're also very well animated to boot!\nGranted, there are some exceptions where lazy design or lackluster work sticks out (an example being a certain line of upgradeable helmets only has 2 textures between all 6 of them), but overall the art is what stands out the most to me.\n- Community\nHonestly one of the nicest MMO communities I've seen. There's hardly any hostilities towards other players and most players are genuinely helpful towards one another. The glaring exception being the PvP minigame, Lockdown.\n\nNegatives:\n- Updates\nOne of the most disappointing things about the game is the general lack of content brought by updates. It is understandable that updates aren't frequent when you realize how small the OOO dev team is, but the amount of content released over the course of the two years I've played is pitifully small. A lot of the "new" content is just rehashed older content to pad out the game or one-time bosses, enemies, and set pieces put into single Missions while the rest of the gameworld (which is played VASTLY more than most single Missions) is in sore need of more variety.\nAnd that's not even getting into the annoying cash-grab updates dedicated solely to costumes.\n- Performance\nBeing an MMO built on Java, there's definitely going to be performance issues unless the game is perfectly optimized (which it isn't). An abundance of entities on the screen can slow the game to a crawl no matter the quality, which wouldn't be a problem if there weren't also an insane abundance of levels that use huge hordes of enemies and particle effects. The game lags a lot and that's not even getting into the extremely small number of servers causing problems for those that can't get a decent connection.\nThen there's also an inherent problem with the game running on Macs which further harms performance. Not as pronounced a problem, but definitely noticeable.\n- Balance\nOne of the biggest breaking points for me. The balance of the arsenal of weapons and armor is abyssmal. Some weapons are inexplicably far more powerful and useful than others. Others are so painfully useless or weak that it's a wonder if they get used at all.\nExample: Any armor that "emphasizes" defense doesn't offer much more defense than other armors that also offer major attack bonuses. Even then, most of the defensive sets only allow you to take a single extra hit or maybe two incomparison to the offensive sets. Essentially, any armor set that doesn't boost your attack power in some way is obsolete to those that do.\nIt's been this way for YEARS, with the community clamoring for balance and suggesting ways to balance things out. Some balance changes were even promised for underpowered or broken weapons, but after more than a year on some of them, no changes have been made.\nIt completely baffles me why the devs can't simply change numbers around on the equipment, but it apparently is too tough for them to do so.\nSpeaking of broken balance...\n- Lockdown\nThe broken balance certainly doesn't help things in Spiral Knight's PvP mini-game. Aside from equipment making it hard to take seriously, it's a PvP game and generates all the toxicity that a PvP crowd can. Unless you're really into PvP, it's best to steer clear from this unbalanced mess.\n- Grinding\nBeing a Free-to-Play MMO, grinding is to be expected. However, with the limited number of randomly generated areas and how little moneyand experience some areas offer in comparison to the boss levels, it gets incredibly dull, incredibly fast.\nAnd then there's the issue of the Forge, a mechanic that slows down a player from levelling their equipment. Aside from needing the game's equivalent to experience, you also need a rather big number of rare items for a CHANCE to bring your euipment to the next level unless you use a LARGE number of said rare items to get that chance to 100%. Then there's the fact that you can't access the Forge from everywhere in the game, which creates a disconnect between gaining a level and that rewarding feeling of leveling up.\n- Difficulty\nI don't quite agree with OOO's idea of difficulty being to add more health and damage onto monsters or to throw so many monsters at the players that damage is nigh unavoidable. It just reinforces the superiority of the offensive sets of equipment since they can deal with both sitautions faster and more efficiently. More diverse groupings of enemies or improving the AI along with the general power given to the players is the more fulfilling and strategic route to go, in my opinion. Giving the mosters more health and damage just makes battles long, grindy, and extremely frustrating should they touch you.\n- Revive system\nThis used to be a big plus for the game until the mechanic was completely overhauled earler this year.\nBefore, players could pick up any allies that got incapacitated at the cost of half of their health. It encouraged teamplay and helping each other out, while also making most players cautious with their health since it could save a teammate as well.\nNow, you can't offer your health to revive your team. It instead relies on a rare item that you can either get from treasure drops or purchase with your own money. If you want to revive a teammate it's going to cost you one of your own revive items and to even do so you have to open a menu and select to revive said teammate. It takes a lot more time and is never even mentioned as an option in the game as opposed to the old method where all you had to do was stand near your teammate, see the revive icon, and click.\nThis change really broke the teamplay aspect of the game for me. Instead of your team making daring rescues to revive one another, now you have your team lying on the floor begging for a revive because they don't want to use their own.\n- End game\nThe end game has been stagnant for more than a year now. Once you have your 5 Star equipment set and reach the end of the Missions there honestly isn't much to do unless you have money to pay for the Shadow Lairs. Even then, the Shadow Lairs are seriously just rehashed boss levels with hordes more enemies to make it more "difficult." What's worse is that you have to pay an exorbitant amount of Energy/real money to even enter one of them ONCE. All for useless, gimmicky pieces of armor.\n\n-----\n\nAnd that's my review for the game. Feel free to give it a look (it is free afterall), but be warned that there are a LOT of problems with the game.\nPersonally, I'd recommend trying out another free MMO like Warframe or maybe Vindictus.","December 9, 2013","false","343.9"," 514 of 728 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","514","728","0","19"

I still do. Love its' artstyle, the design, the unique atmosphere, and all my friends who have supported me through these 4 years in the game. and the 5035 hours oh my ****ing god!\nOne thing that hasn't changed during the years is the artstyle and all the crazy cool new (and cute) stuff that has been added into the game. The community is mostly nice, apart from a few rotten apples. The artwork that has been made based on this game is enthralling at least. The epic moments when battling a boss with a bunch of friends via a voice chat system is a thing to remember even after many years.\n\nEven though all these fun times, I am obliged to quit this game.\n"But why, Dreff? You said that you'll never quit this game ever!\nForge Okay so in the old times, your gear would gain heat which levels them up after the heat bar is filled to the max. You only had to get in the clockworks and play, and after the level was completed, you'd get heat and if the bar got filled, the weapon leveled up. Now you need to upgrade with Fire Crystals. Reason why it is so annoying is because it is really going to limit your weapon upgrading to the ones that you really want to have level 10. The game also urges you to spend your pennies on fire crystals to level your gear up faster.\n\nPay 2 win?\nI've spent a horrendous amount of money on this game. Most of my purchases I made for this game to show my support and maybe get some cool items along the way. A fair time ago you obtained prize boxes via a normal energy purchase. I really liked that, you'd only get a couple of boxes along with a purchase but you'd get that energy along. Then the system was changed so that you couldn't get boxes along for free via an energy purchase. This is the one reason why the energy prices in game are so high.\n\nEnergy Price in-game\nYou can pay in game via a direct change of X crowns into 100 energy, or sell 100 energy for X crowns. The prices used to be static 5000cr which was pretty cheap. The current prices are double as much. One of the reasons for this is that people don't buy any Energy with real money anymore. During an event, you could get boxes along energy purchases. Most of the people sold their energy via the Energy Trade system in the game (Post offers to sell/buy energy for x amount of crowns) Nowadays it's a pretty static 9k-10k crowns to get 100 energy.\n\n\nFurthermore\nAnother thing which causes players not to buy ce directly is because you can get way more energy with other virtual currencies, such as tf2 keys. The least amount of energy you can buy in SK with real money is 750e. It costs about 2,40€, basically slightly more than a tf2 key would cost me, (currently 2,20€ per tf2 key) If you sell those keys to a player you found in-game or via the forums, you'd get 2000e/key. More than 2x energy than buying it in-game. Awesome, right?\n\nLess challenging & other\nIn the older times, there weren't many of the new additions, such as the Battle Sprites, Dash & Shield Bash, etc. I think these along with some other things have made the game a lot more easier than before. I personally enjoyed the difficulty, perhaps the ridiculous stacking revive costs with energy were a bit too much though. But, when you ran with a party, you could run next to a fallen party member, revive them for the cost of half of your own health. It made the game interesting to play with a party, since there was no way you could pay energy prices every time you died. You could also drop health pills if your team had none and desperately in need of some delicious pills, which made co-working together important and it stiched people together.\n\nThe Core\nAight, the big one. Cherry on top of the cake. You delved every time down to the clockworks, fighting monsters and grabbing that loot. Once you ventured all the way to the bottom, there was this mysterious thing called... The Core. First time I made it into the core I was just thinking that what on earth could be inside that thing? Valuables? Maybe a whole new series of levels, insanely difficult but rewarding at the same time? None of those I am afraid... Just... White space. Me and so many others were so excited about it! This could have been such a potential for new, intriguing missions to do, new content that would last for a fair amount of time. Sigh.\n\nInactivity\nSigh. I've had a ton of cool friends in-game that I played actively with, got to know better and who helped me during my tough times. No, I wasn't just seeking acceptance from randoms online, some of my closest of friends helped me during my darkest of hours It's a shame that people are quitting the game, I've lost 100 or so people from my friends list, some of which I didn't really even get to say goodbye to. Now, some of my friends will go through the same, as I leave without saying farewell or anything.\nFarewell,\n-Dreff\n\nGG no re","February 16","false","146.4"," 95 of 113 people (84%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","84","95","113","8","12"

Overall this game has been quite a lot of fun for me through the years of play and I think it will continue to be so for me. Some people however do a lot of complaining (even me sometimes) about how the game needs to expand in many different ways of functioning content of the players instead of cosmetic, but I think this game has actually stayed fairly true to the origin of being an "arcade game" type and has kept that in mind when add-in’s have happened. This is not a game to run around in open and endless fields, fighting monsters at random locations, but actual arcade play where we have different levels or "depths" as they're called with mostly set setups, though still with a very large variety of monsters and types of depths through the game to experience many new things and keep the game entertaining.

I enjoyed most of my time playing with friends, and the large quantity of weapons and armors seemed very enjoyable.  However, the game has numerous difficulty spikes, along with areas that (thanks to newer updates) almost force you to pay to get the best type of armor you want.  However, thanks to the varying damages and damage resistances, as well as status effects, newer players are basically punished for not paying.  Although they have made quite a few changes to the game since it began, some of which making it much easier for newer players (such as doing away with elevator costs, and removing "Mist energy", they replace those things with more difficulty spikes.\n\nAlso, while the game is nice when you begin, and harder later on (forcing you to play with others, and hopefully good players at that), the other portions of the game (PvP, and the DLC's) are extremely lacking.  PvP is a mashup of horrible pings, buttmad children, and people using the game's auto-aim feature.  The DLC's offer you two things: A useless couple costumes, along with extra lives and such, or an extremely annoying (and difficulty spike filled) raid on a Gremlin base.  However, at the end you get an overpowered weapon, decent bomb, and the ability to make a decent gunner mask.\n\nThe story of the game is also lacking.  It seems almost like they aren't sure what to do with the game.  They have plenty of lore, whether it be about the Spiral Knight Order, or any of their enemies, however they seem to have nowhere to take the game's story from here.  The "end" of the game was supposed to be getting to the core to find an energy source and leave.  Instead, you get to the core, find out its locked, and have an option (if you save up a lot of in-game money, or pay roughly $7.50) to re-play any of the four boss levels, only more satanic, leading you to believe that you're in that world's version of hell, perhaps.  However, the game stops there.  It leaves so many questions that I'm sure everyone wants answered.  What happened to the recon unit, what happened to the Shadow Lairs, what happens to Warmaster Seerus, what is in the core, or even if you will escape?\n\nSadly, i've been playing this game for around two years, and in my time they havn't added much in story progression since then.  I'll reccomend the game now, but I feel they're losing players, and if they don't finish the story in a good way, or at least expand more, the game will kinda get empty, and eventually die.","January 11, 2014","true","647.7"," 84 of 104 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","84","104","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrMunkey/recommended/99900/","MrMunkey","Mr.Munkey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrMunkey/","148 products in account","If I was writing this review 2 years ago I would say, "HELL YEAH! PLAY DIS ♥♥♥♥♥!" but as time moved on there was a new update which gave the game a new overhaul of mechanics. For those who are unfamiliar you might not notice any difference, but back then there was an energy system that stopped players from playing or reviving in the dungeons when they ran out; this was known as the mist energy system. You were allowed up to have up to 100 mist each day which would be used for crafting, elevator fees to get to missions, and revives. As much as I complained about the old system to my friends, it still had a nice balance to the f2p model, since if you went into the dungeons others can help pay the fees and other players can revive teamates by giving them part of their health. This idea allowed for more cooperative play with others and made the community more nice. Even though some may argue the idea that restrcting time played was a bad thing, I think it was a good idea, especially considering that those who play games for hours on end eventually get bored of playing them. Think of how the horrible android and ios games keep others playing, because they don't tire out the game the whole day through charging towards beating it. Besides if you liked the game and wated to continue playing for as much as one wants you could support the devs and pay real life money for energy (ingame currency) for as low as 2 bucks!\n\nNow to fast forward to today, the overhual update ripped the energy system which means no more elevator fees, good right? Well for that reason alone, yes, but as for what happens to the balancing I didn't think it was worth it. Now that you can play as much as you desire, the devs needed to add more artificial time which creates the lovely mmo sin of grinding. Grinding is a standard for many f2p mmo's but this game takes it to a new extreme. If you weren't a vanguard (the highest level in the game) before the update then you would most likely never reach that feat without sacrificing your time away for social life, friends, family, every other game, or even talking on the phone before you can possibly think to reach the next rank. (Yes most of that was exaggerated, but it is the slowest leveling process I have ever experienced to date.) For players who aren't badass vanguards with their awesome guild will most likely be spending their time grinding for months, the game looses its playability and gets boring and stale. Another major complaint is that revives can no happen by someone sacrificing health for others, nope! Instead they decided to go with another approach to balance the game for making profits, which is the sparks of life system. You NEED sparks of life in order to revives or wait as you team goes to the next floor. If you run out well too bad for you now go buys some more. I know someone will argue that you can buys some from the auction house, while yes that is true it also gives another reason to grind even more beside leveling and gear which you need in order to progress to the next rank.\n\nNow to talk about pvp! Oh boy what to say...well if you aren't a vanguard with high level gear and an awesome team full of vanguards also with high quality gear, then you will always die in an unfair fight. The reason why this happens is because the matching system has the same algorithm system as christianmingle.com (no offense to christians of any sorts) and will pair you up against a team that out guns you the whole way, so no pvp unless you are high level with good gear and a good team of friends or a guild. This system was broken before and after the overhual update so that aspect would be a complaint either way.\n\nNow we get to talk about content and updates, "oh goody, tehehehehe!" *Ahem* I don't exactly know who to point my finger at but I'm going to direct the blame towards Sega since publishers usually have more control over monotization and content updates than the actual developers. Sega I'm sorry to have to inform that, costumes and outfits don't count as extra content as those are asthetics that you only buy, thus the word monotise comes in. Content should be more updates to add to the game that will give it more play time and replayability not a cheap ploy and tactic to make more money besides the ludicrous sparks of life system. Now content in this game is just an expansion to the new minigame called "auction house madness" (yes I made that up) which means that if you want to get access to the new "content" well then go grind for three months to buy them from the auction house or just use your real life money to exchange it for ingame currency. I am not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you I once put $20 into this game when I returned to play with my friends and guess where most of the want to... yep you are most likely correct, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ costume! I am ashamed of myself for not realizing what I fell for, and then I bought 20 sparks of life that I shared with my friends and our guild, to which we then ran out within the first week in order to not start over on the rediculous boss fights that we were not prepared for. I now hate Sega and I will never trust them with ANY game, period! Do NOT put any money into this game, I swear, I hate everything that the corrupt publishers in this industry stand for and ruining our favorite games. If you do spend money after reading this review then shame on you, you don't derserve to be viewed as a gamer as they would not stand for the ♥♥♥♥.\n\nNow for a little story: Spiral Knights was once a love for me, she would give me happiness and give my friends and I something to do when we were seeking a game to play. I mean sure she would sometimes just sit there after a certain amount of time but I would usually repay her kindness in full to which she then spent more time with us before the day was over. Unfortunately, she now has suffers from a mental dissorder that her step father induced to fullfill his greedy needs. As much as I hated to, we left her and never looked back.\n\nNow ending off after the cheesy story telling, I give this game a thumbs down with the side note of thanks Sega, you truely opened my eyes, now I know who lies behind the real ideas of what a gamer want and it defenitely wasn't you.","August 3, 2014","false","79.6"," 84 of 104 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","84","104","6","0"

I was instantly hooked on this simple game primarily due to the community of friends that played this game with me.  To understand the perspective of this review, I believe it would help to understand the type of player I was.  I reached the end-game completing every dungeon available.  I played at the top tier player-vs-player (PVP) level with - at the time - a vast variety of superior gear.\n\nPROS: You do not need to invest a a single penny into SK to beat the game, or to enjoy it.  The majority of its paid content is cosmetic and to speed up the farming process.  The game can be played solo, but has its benefits for being played in a co-op party up to four players (random or friends).  These benefits include more loot drops, a teammate revival system, and the normal benefits with playing with a party of friends.  There is no character leveling system, and your advancement comes from upgrading your armor and weapons.\n\nCONS: For an MMORPG, however, SK has many flaws.  The game does not offer a spell casting system (aside from the addition of pets in late 2013), only the choice of swords, guns, bombs, and a shield.  By and large, swords are the superior weapon of choice, though balances over the course of 4 years have attempted to narrowed this superiorty gap.  In addition, the game is extremely limited in its end-game content, with the storyline still not being completed for over 3 years.  SK is constantly riddled with latency issues, and simple balances suggested by the community are largely ignored despite the community's desire to be involved with the direction that SK will take.\n\nVerdict: SK is honestly a cute, fun, and simple game.  The game has undergone a variety of changes over the several years it has been out; these changes are largely aesthetic, however.  SK suffers from the lack of new content and a completed storyline.  It is plagued with latency issues and the lack of balancing.  While I would recommend more avid gamers to look into other free MMORPG game such as Warframe, Vindictus, or Neverwinter.  SK does draw from its strengths - being cute, free, and simple - and it can truly offer many hours of fun memories with the right group of players.","February 22, 2014","true","682.7"," 60 of 80 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","60","80","0","0"

Players can influence the areas they enter by depositing different minerals into the gates before they open. As players level up, they can upgrade their equipment or craft new items.\nEvery Spiral Knight has two attacks: one primary attack with a melee weapon and one special attack. You start with a gun but can later gain access to bombs, and your arsenal is constantly changing as you defeat new enemies and learn to manufacture new weapons.\nOne of Spiral Knights' greatest strengths is its art direction.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/enshadu/recommended/99900/","enshadu","ESD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/enshadu/","317 products in account","Let me get the first issue out of the way: everything is server-side. Positioning, projectile paths, health, and loot -- the entire game-state is determined there.\nThis may not seem like such a bad thing, since many online games are like that. But in this game especially, an action game that demands precision and timing, even a small amount of latency can mess up an otherwise perfectly executed run, and it places an inherent limit on level design.\n\nImagine you've got a lame ISP, or you live somewhere many miles away from the servers, like Australia. See that wheel rolling down the field towards you? Yeah, it's already hit you. Since your connection isn't that great, the server won't realize you've moved your character out of the way until it's too late, and by then it'll already have decided that you've been hit.\nSee that energy bolt the gun puppy just fired? No, you didn't dodge it, sorry. What, you moved away, changing direction at the last second? Oh, but the way the system works, it continuously executes the last command your client sends to the server (which is why you sometimes see people running into the wall when they disconnect). It sure would be horrible if it was just a little bit too slow to send your desire to move away, huh?\n\nThis is why I find the combat in something like Phantasy Star Online 2 to be more satisfying. It wouldn't really be suitable for this game, but in PSO2, your interactions with enemies are client-side. You are always positioned at where you appear, and you will never be hit by something that shouldn't have hit you due to latency delay. This has a side-effect of making partying with others slightly confusing, but at least there it is impossible to blame the system for your death. Making these actions client-side has other effects on the game, like the risk of opening the game up to hacking, and occasional difficulty working in sync with your party, but that's all beyond the scope of this review.\n\nBy contrast, in Spiral Knights, you will never see a timing challenge any more stressful than slowly walking across some trap panels as they alternate their active states. You will never see any truly fast enemy or anything that represents an actual danger as evidenced by updates that have neutered enemy AI and behaviors within the last few years. To be fair, OOO has made several valiant attempts to remedy this, through shadow lairs and various danger missions(the dailies, Grinchlin, Tortodrone). But new, truly challenging missions have been few and far in between, and everybody's already figured out the lairs and the dailies.\n\n...And don't be fooled by the apparently low sys reqs on steam. If your graphics card and processor aren't up to snuff, MARVEL AT YOUR REVOLUTIONARY 10 AND SOMETIMES 5 FRAMES PER SECOND\n\nSo what does this game have going for it?\nCharm.\nIt is sort of perversely like Blizzard art direction, in which it is well made, with strong detail and proper form. And, also like Blizzard art direction, it hides a somewhat simple, perhaps even degenerate, game behind its pretty veneer.\nAnyway, the style here is very simple, yet engaging. It draws you in, entices you. It is kind of like Maplestory in this regard, and that game had a TON of charm. Yet, rather also like Maplestory, it doesn't really have a lot of depth to it. And again they're both pretty much full of absurdly rich, absurdly bored people playing dress-up these days.\n\nSo why do I still play it? Nostalgia for what used to be. And a desire for a game like this that does everything better.\n\n\nADDENDUM\nIn response to a particular comment I wrote the following text. It merits inclusion in the review:\n\nMy internet connection is great. But so much of this game seem to have been tailored to suit a sub-par connection. A few years ago, enemy AI used to be more difficult. Now, wolvers and zombies are motor-impaired. Retrode lasers are a joke. The only monster families that pose any real challenge now are the fiends and gremlins, and even then, fiends were slightly nerfed a few months ago. It is no accident that the most challenging missions (notably, Grinchlin Assault and Tortodrone) feature them prominently.\n\nAnd some of my friends HATE it. A good connection -- and a good computer! -- seems to be the only reason I can appreciate these missions because without both they are almost unplayable.\n\nAlmost, because, well, a few years back I used to play this on a crappy laptop. It gave me 24fps AT BEST, and I was still able to perform FSC runs quite handily(but anything beyond a shadow lair level of difficulty was impossible, because the integrated graphics chip just couldn't handle it).","January 4, 2015","false","623.8"," 88 of 132 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","88","132","4","4"

Not mentioning how much the community in pvp complains like no tomorrow or how the developers only updates the game with actual content once every 2 years. Nope, none of that, no where in this guide shall I write about any of that.\n\nSpiral knights is developed by three rings design ( also the developers of the popular online puzzle game, puzzle pirates ) and published by sega. Spiral knights ( SK ) is a Hack 'n slash MMORPG zelda type game.\nSK is a 2D imensional game in a 3D environment. It has a birdseye view, slightly tilted so that you can see a lot more going on at the top than in the bottom-- I don't need to go over this stuff, right?\n\nGameplay :\n\nSK is a dungeon crawler based game, it's not sandbox/open world.\n\nWeapons\nThere are a crap load of weapons. There are three main weapon types\nGuns,\nSwords,\nBombs.\n\nAnd then for each of these, there are 4 types of damage, normal, elemental, shadow and piercing. And then some of them have status effects, Stun, fire, freeze, etc.\n\nYou basically hit stuff until they die. There's a shield button too, but it's better to kill things before they get a chance to even touch you.\nSwords are easier to use than guns. I can't speak for bombs as I have not used them much before.\nFor swords, all you really need to do in PvE is the same thing as cookie clicker except that you click untill they die. You need to learn a few more 'advanced' gameplay mechanics for gunning in order to avoid the reload so that a lot more guns become viable to use. The mechanics don't take more than a day to learn and that's about as hard as the game gets. PvE wise, at least.\n\nThere is a mission mode for PvE which help you get from one tier to the next. You do set levels and get the one-time rewards. However, they are repeatable and you can still get the dropped loot from monsters and treasure boxes.\n\nThe (not so) main mode now for PvE is the arcade. Randomly generated levels that you can play through, getting progressively harder every 4 levels or depths, with a mini-town in between which we call strata's e.g. 'Strata 4' would be levels 13 ~ 17.\n\nThere are 4 bosses in total, with 1 additional DLC boss.\nAnd many different variants / types of monsters to beat up.\n\nThis game's gear is gained through crafting. ( which reminded me of dark cloud 2 / dark chronicle which I loved very much when I was younger )\nThey are split into stars. 1*, 2*, 3*, 4* and 5 stars.\nGetting stronger as you go up, Duh.\nYou purchase recipes from NPC's or other players and find the materials required for making the gear. And then you've got to get alchemy orbs. They are a fairly rare drop from treasure boxes and you need 3 of the same orb, that is the same star as the gear you want to make or upgrade to. Though these orbs can be found anywhere in PvE treasure boxes, you can also spend real money to get 'Energy' in order to buy these orbs. Though, unlike many other MMO's, you can buy energy from other players with in-game currency dropped by monsters. It acts like a stock market.\n\nFrom start to end ( 1* ~> 5* ) I'd say it would take about a good 100 ~ 150 hours if you're new to the game ( from personal experience ). 50 if you're buying your way through it although the game's a lot more fun when you take your time. SK is a lot of fun with friends too, up to a 4 man co-op party in PvE.\n\nSprites:\nThere are currently 3 sprites in-game. They give passive bonuses as well as 3 different skills for each pet.\nThey're not much but they're there.\n\nPvP - The end-game stuff that's a lot harder than PvE. ( There's also a pvp mode called bomber ma-- I mean blast network )\n\nIn SK, PvP ( Player vs Player ) is called Lockdown ( LD ). LD may look easy and cool at first and it's easy to pick up and get kil-- play* though You need to know ( a poop load ) more game mechanics to be good at PvP in SK. The learning curve is what kept me in the game after all these hours. In PvP, there is a huge skill leap from PvE and because of this, many players get discouraged and don't play it at all. But PvP is a wonderful thing in SK, you can kill people and win.\n\nThere are 3 different classes for PvP\nGuardian, Striker and Recon.\n\nGuardian has a huge shield that protects team mates within a certain radius from enemy attacks\nRecon can cloak / go invisible and juke people to death\nStriker(S) with two capital s' coz most people play strikers. Can walk prettay fast and dodge and run.\n\nThey all give different stat boosts and debuffs ( unboosts? Disboost? Inboost? ) and play differently.\n\nAnd though a lot of people say there isn't much content, ( probably after playing for at least 200 hours, yes, if you don't pvp after or try new weapons/armour, there probably is a lack of content after 200, 200. Two hundred hours ) there is at least 100 hours of content with great gameplay mechanics and this is free. FREE . The game is still being updated and has events every few months.\n\nThank-you for reading this painstakingly long review.\nSpiral knights is a good game with easy to grasp, hard to be good at, mechanics and I have enjoyed my time with it very, very much.","January 10, 2015","true","337.0"," 35 of 44 people (80%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","80","35","44","19","4"

The cooperative play is great and even has voice communication. This game has changed a lot since it came out and most of the changes were positive. They have added a ton of content that repeatedly pulled me back in from other games that I moved to.\n\nThe game no longer sees these huge updates. The caring support and community inclusion is no longer there. With the departure of senior developers and the management of Sega has left the game as a cash-grab at best. It has become a money sink with no real reason to put money into it.

Well It's for a reason;\n\nFor starters i got into it and i was hyped, It was so cool so many different things tons of stuff, but i realised this isn't a good game. Here's why:\n\n1: The game has low content. Three rings doesn't focus on it the way they should, Instead they focus on another game with less players and less activity.\n\n2: The community is ♥♥♥♥. Litterally the whole community is horrible. I mean there is some exceptions and I've met some good friends on there, but the majority is crap. They all have a GIANT ego and if you insult it your automatically put into hated and you really have a horrible time. Also they all brag about how much "Ingame money" they have and it gets annoying, I will say why in a minute.\n\n3: Three rings made a good game but they ruined it: Okay I know you guys are like "No they didn't!" Well yes they kinda did. For starters it is SO hard to get ingame money legit. They have it to where everything is high priced you would want, but if you pay for it you can get rich with about $100. That means that the majority of the community is pay to win and they brag about the money that came out of their mom's wallet. Another thing is they post little to no content i said it before, but im saying it again this game is so low content.\n\n4: What they do with the money: So we all know sonic is dead, Yes I know i have a tails' picture as my profile pic, but Sonic was kinda over done, it also didn't survive the leap to 3D. So what 3 Rings is doing with the money you spend on the game is handing it over to sega, giving them money to make more sonic games.\n\n5: The gameplay is ♥♥♥♥: Now I said that grinding in the earlier here's a close up on that. For 1 you have to put in 100+ man hours to get to the max level with good gear. For 2 The money grind on the max level is hard, you have to do a last boss mission that takes 30 minutes to do for a small sum of 8,000 crowns. That means on a saturday a regular person would go from 12:00 Pm- 10:00 Pm is only making about 20 runs a day and 160,000 crowns, which is a small amount.\n\nThats my complaints it really could be a good game if they fixed them but their not gonna do that anytime soon.

A nice 4Co-Op game with a good amount of levels and some Bosses.\nBut okay, I admit something after playing this for some good time. IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO EVOLVE AND UPGRADING. Seriously, you have to upgrade your armor, weapons and shields. But that will only make you farm like hell! Because ♥♥♥♥♥ are EXPENSIVE! Play like 3 hours until your energy runs out, get some money, buy stuff, upgrade, play another 3 hours the next day, get money, get Crystal Energy, play ANOTHER 3 HOURS IN THE NEXT DAY (until the energy runs out AGAIN!), spare money and Crystal Energy for later, and so on.\nConclusion? This game loses its fun with time. Too much farming, too much time lost.\nThe only way to upgrade quickly is to actually BUY CRYSTAL ENERGY WITH REAL MONEY, so you can sell it to others, and keep Energy for you can earn some cash (in-game) to upgrade and buy stuff.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brawlbarian/recommended/99900/","Brawlbarian","PorkOnRye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brawlbarian/","143 products in account","Spiral Knights seems great, but lacks in plenty of places\n\nSpiral Knights is an alright MMO, alright for free at least. It's definitely worth a try, seeing as how the initial pricetag is agreeable. For me, however, it's more of a social platform than a real kind of game. Allow me to explain as to why I see it as I do.\n\nPart 1: The Gear\n\nSpiral Knight's selection of equippable gear is quite wide at first glance, there are plenty of different resistances and weaknesses to all kinds of armor, all of which can be interchanged at a moment's notice, but the variety is wasted upon especially superior gear that provides a kind of range that none other can provide. For example, if you were to choose between say, a Seraphic set or a Wolver set, the seraphic would give a damage buff equal to that of the wolver. However, the Wolver set gives a universal buff to swords, meaning that it does what the seraphic does, but can go beyond that, as well. It's armors like those that begin to break down the options available through common sense and unfair stats. Why anyone would go with an armor so selective versus an armor completely open-ended is beyond me, and most likely anyone else.\nAn even better case is when it comes to early-game bombers and bombers overall. Bombs themselves are fairly underpowered items when working up, so it's more likely people go Gunner or Swordsman, for better attack and whatnot. Bombers overall that strictly follow the bomber line can choose the Mad Bomber Gear, giving them amazing stats for bombs, but horrible defense. There's another armor that does this, surprisingly, but, get this, it does it for EVERY WEAPON. Whoever decided that was a good idea must've thought pretty lowly of bombers, as it completely voids the Mad Bomber gear, allowing for sidearms and whatnot to be used in conjunction with bombs. All in all, the gear doesn't stop there, and most likely won't as the game progresses.\n\nPart 2: Updates\n\nYou'd think with the previously mentioned, they'd begin working on balancing armors and fixing things up, right? Hah, no. You want some costumes? Here's a few hundred. You want some reskins? Here's a box of 'em, have fun. Balancing the game is about as much of a lie as Santa. As while it's not real content, some people still love ripping open the new boxes and slapping whatever colorful paper that was inside right onto their character. I can understand dishing out some cash for a thing to make you look snazzy, but why feed a company more money when their game's pretty darn broken? I understand wanting to make the most out of the overpowered gear, but seeing one team of adventurers run into a dungeon all brandishing the same kind of gear is boring, stale, and just sad. There is no unique quality among players, no matter what little accessory they slap onto their armor, it's still the same cookie-cutter formula. I had more fun running into a dungeon with some close friends of whom we all chose oddjob gear, it was complex, it was different, it was confusing, and most of all, it was fun. Don't even begin on promised "updates" that hold new gear, as they delay for as long as they can. I'd get more in-depth with it, but I'll have to get back to you on that one. (Pun intended.)\n\nPart 3: The Monotony\n\nSo say you've finished the endgame, you've beat Vanaduke, heated your gear as far as you please, and have successfully reached the coveted rank of Vanguard. What's left? Apparently not much, if you don't have a guild, some good Spiral Knights friends, or anything immediately tying to it. The endgame leaves very little left, sure you have PvP, sure you have Blast Network, sure you might have guildruns, but why bother? PvP offers gear that has an alternative spin on some of your favorite (not-by-choice) weapons, with some stats made exceptionally worse, or some still a bit broken. But what's that to you? You've spent all this time grinding through repetitive missions for the things necessary to create your god-tier gear, so why bother struggling through all of that again? And don't try to play the card that PvP is interesting, it's usually the people with the broken gear using the broken swords. More often than not it's always Skolver wearing Strikers with the occasional Gunner or Snarbolax wearing Striker. Blast Network's just a bomberman port, playable by all skill levels no matter what, and to be fair, it's fairly fun. However, the lack of discrimination between skill levels can make it harsh on those who try it out, and more experienced players could potentially offset newcomers who'd like to begin playing as well.\n\nPart 3-2: The Monotony\n\nDon't think it's just endgame, either, as the monotony can set in as immediately as when you first begin to start. The missions assigned to you to gain rank feel incredibly scripted and not as free as they could be. It feels more like a chore than anything else, and nowhere near as fun as the random generation of the Clockworks (Which seems to be, for the most part, swept under the rug.). The Clockworks now takes discovering on your own to find, which the game already doesn't reward, making it harder to want to do so. Missions are also more likely to have the boxes you need to find to use for the drop system to give you the main crafting materials that you need for better gear, so that's another hit against the Clockworks. If you find that grinding much to your distaste, don't worry, the online store will be happy to help, for the right price, of course. Online store not your cup of tea either? The Auction House sells them at prices only a "few" monotonous boss runs can pay for!\nI'm sure I could go on, but the review's already long enough as is.\n\nOverall\n\nSpiral Knights is an okay MMO, not great under any means, but it's not horrible. The only shining light that keeps this game from a true dark abyss would have to be it's community. The community has it's fair share of mean customers and nice folk. You can find some pretty good friends, and some truly cool people on this game. All it takes is a little bit of chatting, and you've found one heck of a pal. The missions and so are more tolerable with a fun group, as the dulling world can take on a new sense of rejuvenation with good talks, funny dialogue, and crazy moments. This game is saved by it's community, whether it be a good or bad thing. I only ever come back to Spiral Knights more for the people than the actual game, truth be told.\n\nAll in all, Spiral Knights receives a 6/10 from me, for what it's worth. The game has alot to fix, and sadly, they haven't done much fixing. The experience can only really be fulfilled with friends, as going alone can dull the sense of wonderment you'll receive initially. I say you take some time out and find a little clique of sorts that you do things with, and you'll make it one great of an experience.","August 12, 2014","false","729.0"," 36 of 56 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","36","56","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Revy_C/recommended/99900/","Revy_C","✪ ReveN3wt™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Revy_C/","28 products in account","Having played this game for around 8,000 Hours (3,800 on this account, and 4,200 on another account) from Late 2011- Mid 2014, I must say it's been a great 3.5 years in the game. So great for me that I wouldn't say it's exaggerating that it has changed my life in many ways. (< Extremely irrevelant to the review though)\n\nAbout the game:\nSpiral Knights is a fun MMORPG game to be playing with a group of friends, completing the missions from the Storyline, collecting all sorts of unique Gear, Costumes and Accessories to customize your character's looks, or even merchanting in the game. (Merchanting is completely optional, but it was something that I've done for over 2 years in the game at least, and it was a good experience, getting to know more players, etc.)\n\nPros:\n-A Wide Selection of Accessories to choose from, making your own unique costume\n-Grinding (If you're into that sort of thing)\n-Chatting inside and outside of the game\n-Merchanting (If you want to include this from your perspective)\n-Challenges for beginners\n-It's Free!\n\nCons:\n-Drops for specific items in-game is pretty rare, and players would sometimes just buy it directly from the Store, the Auction House or Players because they're not getting the drop.\n-Once you've cleared everything, incluiding the DLC, you have pretty much nothing left to do, asides from collecting new gear and so on.\n\nSpiral Knights from my Point of View:\nBack when Nick was still in OOO, Spiral Knights was updated with a lot of new events, challenges, costumes, etc.\nFor PvE, My friends and I had a lot of fun clearing these challenges and grinding for the gears we so desperately want. Spiral Knights got a whole lot better when the Storyline was introduced, and the plot was interesting enough for us to keep playing, and we wouldn't get bored even though we're killing the same boss over and over again. (Well, that's what grinding in a MMO is about anyway...)\nAs for PvP, being in a different region from the Game Server will affect your gameplay for this game mode. But there are  people who're in the same state as me, but can dominate others. (Kudos to them, and no offence intended to anyone in this comment)\n\nHowever, once Nick left, the amount of content for this game started to drop drastically, and I've only seen 1 or 2 major updates ever since he left. There are still updates to the game, but with just Accessories and Costumes, not much of content. This was the point where my friends and I had pretty much nothing left to do, after having almost everything we wanted. We came up with new ideas to entertain ourselves, such as time attacks for a certain lair, costume contests, etc. (I personally got so bored that I decided to design and make a whole ton of unique Costumes for my Character)\n\nBut after a while, all these ideas started to die down slowly, and I see a lot of Veterans and my friends leaving the game, and I've followed suit, and cashed out from the game, with almost no intention of coming back to play again unless I see an update which can convince me to play again. (I still love the game though..) I do visit the game occasionally, just to see how the game is doing, and everyone who're still playing the game.\n\nThe SK Community is one of the best Communities I've ever seen, and it probably would be. Players helping one another with problems, debates with just about anything related to the game, etc. As mentioned before, I'd hate to leave the game, but with almost no content, I see no reason of staying on.\n\nFor any beginner(s) reading this Review, I welcome you to have a go at this game, but don't be expecting too much unless you're into a lot of grinding for your desired items. :)\n\nTL:DR\n-A lot of grinding required, and pray RNG is with you when it comes to obtaining something you want from Boxes, etc.\n-Intersting Storyline\n-Fun with friends\n-End Game is boring\n\nHave fun, and may the Energy be with you!\n\n-Revolutional","March 11","true","886.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

Right now the game is basically dead, there are like not many people online.

Sadly, this game is completely and utterly dead, and I am certain it will never become active again. The developers pretty much abandoned it, the only thing that it ever updated is adding new cosmetic items available as micro-transactions in-game, which is very sad. This games activity boomed during late 2012 and 2013, and I was lucky enough to play it at the time. It was such a good game, I always came back to playing it. Early 2014 was the last time I properly played it, departing as it was becoming less and less active, and my guild Aurora was in the decline (we were one of the 'big' guilds back then). When I came on SK for the first time in 2 years, I was so sad to see the state it was in. Haven used to be completely bustling with players, all shouting for trades. The marketplace used to be so full, and was constantly being updated by players with more gear available to buy, now Haven and the marketplace are pretty empty. Its also really hard to find any PvE games with other people unless you go out of your way to organise something with the few people that are still playing SK, so you really have to do any PvE solo, which for the most part sucks, because its very hard in the later levels and it takes a long time to do. The only thing that you will be able to play is Lockdown, which is just PvP. The only people who really play SK now are just 'hardcore' PvP players all using the same loadouts. Of course with only 450-500 people in game via Steam each day there are almost never new players, so the game is just steadily dying. Of course I still hav to recommend this game, because if people ever started to play it even twice the amount of people playing now, then that would just be awesome.  This is so very enjoyable to play, and of course, I have so many expensive and rare old items, so if people ever start playing this again I can show off :3 being serious, pleasse give this game another chance, it would be awesome asf if the devs ever started to do anything with this again..

A simple yet rewarding game. Go down the clockworks, level up your weapons, hope Basil has something awesome, kill some bosses, get deeper, trade at the auction house, buy energy through the market at the right time, and so on. The game was so fun yet simple that it lured me back over a year later without even being reminded of it.\n\nSo what is this game now? A grindfest. The main reason for this is because you can no longer level up your equipment more than once in a single Clockworks run, you need to grind for (sometimes ridiculous amounts of) Fire Crystals, waste Heat (experience) and "forge" them even then with a chance of failure.\n\nAdding to this, the mission system feels completely detached from the game itself, in fact a lot of the modes are. Everything just doesn't meld together, it feels like a mix of gameplay ideas all accessed from a mess of a menu system. Zero immersion unlike before.\n\nI can overlook the poor performance because it's a game written in Java. Which in itself is huge feet. Optimising games in Java is hard, especially to look like Spiral Knights does.\n\nThe music is relaxing and exilerating at the right times. The enemies, though lacking in variety, are well designed much like the rest of the characters and stages.\n\nIt's just sad that Three Rings decided to take the game in this direction. Though, with the servers still being somewhat dodgy,  it's probably a choice of what we have now or nothing at all.","August 9, 2014","false","97.5"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","3"

The quality of their work dramatically dropped as they started passing off costumes as already existing armor and reskinned. The mechanics of the game are awesome as in for combat wise and stuff. The economy however is highly unstable and changes depending on the patch. The game really grabs you when you start off considering there are loads to do. After you complete your missions and stuff, it's mostly a vanity game like who has the coolest costume or best equips. The PVP system is a joke, there is no standard arena you can just hop into. It's team dependent besides for blast network. It's very hard to level your equipment now ever since the "heat drought". So it's much harder for low level players to get into the higher tiers. The events are pretty cool but most items released during events are just cheap reskinned knockoffs compared to the beginning.

I will not be absoulutely negative in this review, frankly because I've played more than enough time on this game (200+ Hours) and I enjoyed a majority of said time spent. It was fun. But now, I honestly can never go back to this game, now that I've taken a long hard look at it after some experience playing it and taking a few years of a break away from it. I realized that this game is great sounding on paper, and the execution was probably spot on at the beginning, but as Sega bought the license and copyright to Spiral Knights, you could say it sort of went a little downhill. It became pay to win rather than a good experience for gamers, and to be honest, I fell into the trap and put a lot of money into the game, not an insane amount but still a lot.\nWhen I was playing the game, if you didn't have money to speed up the process, you we're endlessly grinding for materials you needed to upgrade. Depending on your luck, it would last from 30 minutes to several hours just to get that ONE item you need for crafting. It's tedious and repetitive and overall, negative. Another negative is no real FUN minigames to play. The only side things you could do we're play PvP or play a rehashed version of Bomberman, which doesn't really handle all that well. Two important negatives are the gameplay and the soundtrack. I barely remember any tracks from this game, and some just sound like generic music, give or take. Also, the gameplay feels sluggish, and at it's worst, laggy. Also, there are some really annoying difficulty spikes in this game, such as the second boss where you are forced to use shadow weapons or else you lose ultimately.\nThere isn't that much you can do in terms of defense and dodging. For example, there isn't a stand-alone dodge that you can use on a basis. This makes bullet-hell bosses and levels incredibly frustrating to push through, especially in a group. You have a shield, sure, but that won't last long, especially since for me, it was always easy to bust through for enemies, even upgraded. Sometimes you even got shield-locked by enemies who constantly attack you. Enviornments are a little dull to an extent, and even sometimes there's too much stuff happening on screen, causing way too much lag which might get you booted from the game, like I did several times. Not like there really was much to do in this game anyway. In fact, as the months went on, I found myself at the end bored because there wasn't really that much content to keep me entertained for as long as I thought, roughly around a few maps and the occasional boss here and then. They have tried to supply us with updates with new content and the such, but even then, it just isn't enough to keep me around longer. Especially that ludicrous dlc or "packs" that they're giving out now, costing far too much than it's actual value. Basically, Capcom level dlc. Would you pay $40 for one armor set and a few items in the game? If you said yes, you really don't value your money as much as you should be.\nLast but not least, the servers. How do the servers of Spiral Knights hold up? To be honest, they're kinda bad, especially when they are over-populated. If I wanted a lagless experience, I had to go on some of the barren servers. If you decide to join a populated server, prepare for everyone to lag walk, especially in the central district. This game cannot handle so many players at once if the servers are bad. If they manage to fix the servers and give us plenty of more content, I might look back for some revelations. But for now, that's all the negatives. Let's move on to the positives!\nI had a lot of fun with this game with my friends. It was indeed fun to team up on missions together and leveling up your armor and weapons feels good. You can feel a difference in power between weapons and armor and their levels respectibly, regarding the shield. Once you have the materials and money for a new weapon, it feels rewarding to make it and use it. Busting up a monster is fun, especially a boss. The enemies have some variety to them and some are pretty challenging to beat, which is cool. The combat, although sluggish, is pretty solid, if it doesn't lag, ugh. Those are pretty much all the positive I can really think of. I'm not even going to mention the story, because let's be honest: Do any players of Spiral Knights really care for the story at all? Nope, because it's too boring for me to care about and so generic that if this story was in a bad triple AAA game these days, it would fit right in.\n\n----Final Verdict----\n\n5/10 [Average]\n\nThere are far too many flaws and issues for me to consider this a great or good game. However, like I said before, I did have a lot of fun with it, so it's not that bad. If more thought and imagination was put into this game, as well as massive improvements to multiple things, this game woud score highly with me, honest. But as it stands now, this is a game I wouldn't necessarily recommend playing. If there are other people playing this game, why are you still playing this? What drives you to keep playing this game, knowing it's flaws?

It's great for those who enjoy peacocking in a digital world among mostly tweens, but otherwise it's rather unfortunate.\n\nIn the years I've played it, the game has simply lacked in progression.  Then, sadly, when new holiday or special event "limited-time" levels are introduced, the developers focus on making the level as difficult and un-fun as possible. These short-lived levels force you to grind for new collectables in order to attain the object of your desire, all the while getting killed over and over again, forcing you to, essentially, pay-to-play (and/or waste lots of hours grinding... but time is money, no?).\n\nI wish I had more positive things to say about SK... I really wish I could tell you that the story and levels keep getting better and better... that the gameplay is a ton of fun and that the majority of the people you meet won't beg you for your currency or items... that new bosses are being introduced and new strategies keep things interesting... that being in and/or owning a guild has any sort of point whatsoever... that the best update was better than 30-second speed boosts so you don't waste so much time running down long empty halls in each depth...\n\n... but I can't... nope... not at this time at least... maybe in a few years... if it doesn't go the way of OOO's Dr. Who: World's in Time (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who:_Worlds_in_Time)...","February 28, 2014","false","009.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","3"

Most of them are event-only items.\nIf you like collecting rare stuff, this game has it all.\n\nThe intro for the game is great and levels are really detailed. After that the game loses dynamizm and level are procedurally generated, so there are instances that you'll end up in the same corridor. That's the main thing about the levels. Most of them are made from patterns, so there are a lot of combinations, but in-game you feel that's the same level. The music is really memorable and atmospheric. I can't forget the Jigsaw Valley and the menu music.\n\nBecause it's a F2P game, there are instances where packing money is useful, but the only gameplay changing\nelements are weapon slots. You can also buy weapons and armor, but that's only for quicker progress. And here is my issue with the game:\n\nAround Tier 3, you HAVE TO upgrade your equipment in order to continue the game. And the orbs required to craft them are really rare and can go for thousands of crowns. If you are lucky, you'll get there eventually. I had no luck and after two months of grinding, I finally got my FIRST 5-star weapon. Now I have to get my armor and a shield. That's another 8 months to spend, but I didn't had the patience to do this all. Soon, the game got boring.\n\nI played this game for around 2 years and I think it wasn't wasted in any bit.\nMy most proud one is when I attempted the most difficult boss raid designed for 5-star sets. I only got 4 star equipment and I carried my whole 4 member team on my back. They called me the Gordon Freeman of Spiral Knights. That was epic. I died at the final boss, but it was worth it. Tier 3 is pretty challenging. The game gets relatively harder as you play and you can choose harder difficulty for more loot, which is fair.\n\nGet the game, play it for some time. If you like rogue-like games, you'll probably like it.","May 11","true","235.8"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

After 500 hours of gameplay I love practically everything about this game, its easy to learn, fun to play with friends, and making new and better things for your user.\n\nSpiral Knights holds a special place in my heart as it kept making me want to come back and play again and again! Being able to play with other online players in case you are stuck or need help or want to trade to get something that you want. Even the online Auction House is great as its almost (if not) run entirely by the players.\n\nAlong with the fun and challenging arcade mode, there is the main mission mode that helps up your rank withing the game. Each mission consists of a goal while the arcade is made up of random courses that are picked by players and swap between other courses within to keep changing, nothing is ever the same.\n\nLastly is most likely the least favorite thing to do is the crafting as it is a big hassle to collect tons of items and then forge your weapon to the specific level and then having the money to pay costs. Besides forging and crafting this games has to be one of the best ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes out there and its FREE! (Unless you want perks or DLC)\n\nMy Score for Spiral Knights is 95/100\nI Highly recommend giving this game a try and inviting your friends to play through the game with you!","January 6, 2015","true","581.1"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beyboh/recommended/99900/","beyboh","poosh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beyboh/","46 products in account","The main reason I dislike this game is because it follows the very commonly done formula of many FTP/MMOs, that is to say, players who do not want to dish out cash will be forced to grind and grind until they meet the necessary requirements to go onto the next level (in which they must do the same thing again).\n\nAt first, I thought Spiral Knights had a lot of promise. The art style is simply gorgeous, the playable characters, hell, EVERYTHING is adorable, the soundtrack was delightful and to top it all off it all had a huge Zelda influence. I thought this was going to be "Zelda: Four Swords The MMO", an aspect which got me very excited. Mostly because Nintendo didn't add online to the 3DS version of Four Swords.\n\nThis is not Four Swords the MMO. It is not fun. Combat is dreadful, especially by yourself on higher difficulties. In a nutshell, combat can be described as "hit and run" and repeat. There is no strategy involved, it's just a matter of paying attention and hoping the lag doesn't screw you over (this game lags a lot, at least for me and always at the worst possible times. I can't count how many times I've died because of it.) What makes matters worse is that if you die, you will need a material called "Spark of Life" to revive yourself so you don't lose all your things and can continue the mission. However, this material is very hard to find, but of course the only reliable way to obtain it is buying it with money. The only times I can tell you I legitamentally had fun are when I played with friends but then again, anything is fun with friends. You're probably saying, "since you suck at the game why don't you lower the difficulty bro?", well that's where the FTP structure comes in. Spiral Knights prevents you from progressing until your armor meets the minimum rank. In order to accomplish this, the game has a crafting system and you must collect the necessary materials and crowns (game's currency) in order to build the armor you need.\n\nThe problem is that the materials are extremely rare. These materials have a better chance of spawning on higher difficulties, but the drop rate is still low enough that you'll be forced to play the same mission again and again and again and again and again until you finally get what you need. This seems to get worse and worse as the more you progress, the better the armor the rarer the materials are. I assume this is how the FTP structure of this game works, to frustrate people enough to make them spend real money on these materials in order to progress. I can't really blame this, though, since a lot of free-to-play games do this sort of thing. Frankly, it's disgusting and makes for a bad videogame. I'd rather pay upfront for a game that won't give me BS than waste time doing something that's not fun and that I realize won't get me anywhere because the whole game will just be this.\n\nI love the idea of Spiral Knights. I like the lore and the universe and it's characters and it's graphics. But this is a videogame, not a movie or a show so gameplay is the most important thing these sorts of things have to offer. And Spiral Knights offers bad gameplay. Maybe it'd be better off as a retail game or something, but this is just basic MMO design.\n\nBut, you can play this game without paying a single cent. Probably, I haven't finished it and I probably never will. You're just going to need to put up with repetitive, boring grinding to either find the materials or gather enough crowns to buy them off the market.\n\nUnless you have a bunch of friends wanting to play this with you, don't waste your time on this.","August 4, 2014","false","79.7"," 29 of 48 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","29","48","0","0"

Wonderful little time. You had to wait for energy to recharge, and you didnt simply soak 24/7 of your time into it. A few runs a day, chores, other things, then other games. Grinding was bearable and you could revive teammates by giving them half of your life.  Then came the Forge. Grinding stones wasnt an absolute pain for the first 3 tiers, but then came the fact that T1 Gear can only be upgraded by heat & T1 Heat Stones. Another thing is that Gear takes to long to grind! And they made a new item and took away the life saving old revive system! Sparks of Life were the new reviving system, and they were SO RARE, that you only got them in dedicated grinding. VERY DEDICATED GRINDING. There are 5 Tiers of equipment, but you barely even get to own T4 items. I had 2-3 and then i quit. The Developer of this game left 000 (Three Rings) and SEGA took over. SEGA turned this into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ grindfest, which nobody likes. Fast progression to those who paid.

If you don't live anywhere near the game servers, you're going to have a bad time in the later parts of the game. You literally have to press your block key before your enemy even makes its "charge-n-attack" animation, you have to literally make your actions one to two seconds earlier. So you see some dog looking thing, and you're like "oh yeah, let me just hold my block key just as it begins to charge its attack and attempt to hit me and... oh, I got hit? what?" ...\n\nAustralian fans (and I assume many other countires) have been complaining a lot over on the Spiral Knight forums for more than two years, and nothing has happened. Good game, ♥♥♥♥ servers.\n\nEdit: Latency, nothing to do with the strength of your connection, but your location from the server.

Playing with kids are quite enjoyable. It's a nice break from all the salty attitude in FPS games.\n+Abundance of good players who could carry you through harder dungeons (or, in the context of the game; Clockworks)\n+Friendly UI\n+You may conduct in-game trading for weapons and cosmetics. Steam supports it too.\n+Straight forward levels with challenges, puzzles, hidden secrets, etc.\n+Game offers annual events and daily extra missions for optimal varity in gaming experience\n+Free to play\n+Game admins will sometimes respond to player issues by hopping in-game with you. Very nice people.\n\nCONS:\n-The community may be friendly, but it is often hard to communicate with the occasional players who speaks a different language, due to the lack of region lock.\n-Although the game encourages variety in gameplay, the same events pop up every year with very minimal changes. This means that cosmetics are not as collectible as you think.\n-The game will try to steal money out of your pocket at every possible corner of the street: money to revive, money for fees for selling weapons at the Auction House, money to level up your gear, and etc. Not exactly Free to Play, is it?\n-The game allows trading, but never encouraged. You cannot trade away cosmetics which are worn, and you cannot trade away weapons you used without a ridiculous amount of "Unbinding" fee.\n-Game has variety in levels, but only a select few can earn you good profit without spending too much time. This forces some players to have a very narrow style of gameplay. These specific levels established the fundamental procedures to farm for money, and the lack of content overall bores the player easily.\n-Sometimes expected events are overhyped, which causes a general discontent amongst the players.\n\n\nSo, is Sprial Knights a good game? Yes, but only borderline so. There may be a great deal of friendliness to the game, but the lack of player volume and the lack of new content only bores the player.\n\n\nAfter putting some extra time into this game, I can't help but feel that there's so much more that could be done to the game that may contribute to its possible success. It's been about 3-4 years since I've started playing this game, so please, don't get me wrong. I really enjoyed it while it was good to me. I felt alive. I felt energetic. I had friends and folks I could and want to play with. The community is quite friendly, the risk/reward system of levels are well balanced, and overall, I had fun. It was one of the most enjoyable and impactful games of my adolescence. The guild system was fantastic. You could always meet new people and play with them. There was a demand for companionship and sportsmanship everywhere. The User interface is fantastic. Things takes a while to get used to, but things are always there when you need then. The life I've lived in this game is the lovliest, and the love was the liveliest.\n\nBut what happened? I don't know. I can't say for sure that this is a bad game, because it really isn't. I had loved it. Were my observations also my bigotry and prejudice? Did I grow up and move away from this game genre as a whole?\n\n\n\nWhy don't you play it for a bit and tell me?

It's heavily pay-to-win, but, that bit's rather negligible (so long as you never encounter any other players) As you get further in the game, it gets rather ridiculous. Rank-based missions start off simple. One unique/generic level, then advance two one generic and one unique level (if not two generic), and then two generic and one unique (or just three basic, unoriginal stages that you could find elsewhere). The tutorials are fine and dandy, but the lack of continuity in it is a little irritating. The game decides to explain certain monsters on certain difficulties *after* you've already encountered them, which is pretty hecked up in its own right, when they could've easily optimized the mission's levels to not contain something you haven't been taught to understand. Alas, it's straightforward genericstages.\nI haven't invested in it very much, but PvP seems to heavily rely less on survivability, and more on how much damage you can dish out in one life.

And if you dream to be that knight, this game for you. Game narrates about history of knights who were wrecked on a hostile planet. You play for one of these knights and with colleagues you travel on vaults, winning on the way of monsters and solving puzzles to reach a kernel of this hostile planet. Certainly, in original state of Spiral Knights of very few people it will be necessary. It is game without plot, with incidentally generated levels, with crowds of enemies. Only I aim, games tamping of pockets by game currency and continuous search of the best equipment that it was possible to move to more difficult level is. Game on pilaf will hold on or not, everything depends on developers. Certainly, Three Rings Design everything provided it and constantly try to diversify game. First, players lay a hand to creation of levels. Secondly, regular large updatings in which are added new equipment, monsters, bosses, levels and it is a lot of that else. In the third, fascinating puzzles over which it is necessary to think. In four, players can influence game economy. If developers continue in the same spirit game the bigger success waits still, differently players will quickly lose to it interest. The first impression of game as from a usual unpretentious arcade, but after some hours of game you understand that tightens you this fascinating world. In this game everything depends on you and your equipment, after all strength of the real knight depends on ability of possession of the weapon and its jokes. It is game for those who loves browsers with monsters and puzzles. In this game it isn't necessary to turn gray in the days that to achieve something. Probably, the majority represent the knight with a sword in the right hand and a board in left or with a spear on a horse. But these knights except boards and swords can arm with the gun or a bomb and to carry amulets and bracelets, and the number of the most this weapon pleases with a variety. Possibilities of the weapon too strike from a freezing to a damnation. When you use bombs sometimes, apparently, that you play Bomberman, especially it is shown when you battle among boxes. The attention is drawn by game in team, here it isn't necessary to compete because of game currency or resources as everything is distributed equally. Therefore players try to play is put, after all not to pass some moments without harmonious team work and mutual assistance. Game process looks quite attractively, you crumble packs of monsters, you fight with bosses, you plunder treasuries, you solve puzzles. Puzzles in this game deserve attention, they are very interesting, though aren't too difficult. But nevertheless, on pro-procession of two hours, game after all becomes boring.

At first I thought we had been trapped in an ISIS warehouse, but our operatives briefed us that instead he had been deployed to infiltrate one of America's top secret missile bases.\n\nOur team elimated eliminated those wretched American pigs without fail and we proceeded to the R&D centre of the base.

It contains PvE features together with a VERY competitive PvP feature called "Lockdown." As a pro-league Dota 2 player, I felt that Lockdown was really enjoyable to play competitively.\n\nGameplay:\nFor short, it's a dungeon crawler. Nothing too shabby, with the birds-eye-view, you're pretty much aware of a decent radius around your character. The game consists of two default controls which focus on keyboard or mouse although fully customizable to your fitting especially if you have a gaming mouse or a gamepad. The game is full of innovative monsters which you're likely to enjoy and many levels which "rotate."\nGraphics:\nI have to say, I'm rather impressed with the vibrant atmosphere this game has. If you enjoy bright games, you'll love this. The chibi-style avatars are adorable enough to make you have to punch a wall to feel like a man again and the environment is surprisingly detailed. In terms of network-graphics, I'd say they did well enough to avoid graphical-lag - this, I can't explain through words so you'd have to play the game in order to get a feel of fluidity.\nSocial:\nThe player-base is small enough for you to socialize and gain deeper friends and wide enough to feel the game's population. Also, being recently implemented to Steam and Steam trading, it's a lot more convenient if you're a Steam gamer due to trade offers whilst offline and such convenient features - only way to get the feel for it is to actually play it and realize.\nSupport:\nTheir Spiral Knights Support is mainly based on actually mailing them. Their in-game support lacks and doesn't prioritize the most important aspects of so-called "support." So you can't really expect to get a hold of any "support" whilst in-game because it's not that convenient - only way is to contact them through email, which isn't so bad but could improve.\n\nOverall I give the game an 8/10 - which would've been better if it weren't for their bad tech "support" and I emphasize "SUPPORT," not "filter" team.","September 5, 2014","true","344.2"," 48 of 87 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","48","87","2","2"

However the sprite update ruined the game for me and I do not like the direction the game is heading.\n\nPre Sprite Update 9/10\nIt's very fun to explore and level up your weapons. The whole market and trading system was pretty good, especially if you're too lazy to get crafting materials yourself. To sum it up the whole thing was a fun experience for me. The only thing was the elevator costs. So if you run out of mist energy, you have to wait awhile for it to refill, but I guess that is the cost of it being "Free-to-Play" right?\n\nAfter Sprite Update 4/10\nThe big problem of this update was the heat nerf. So now it's a pain in the a$$ to level up your weapons and armour. The actual sprites aren't so bad themselves, you get a little extra power against enemies. Before the update I bought a elevator pass, so when the update came they removed elevator costs so they traded in my pass for a bunch of crystal energy and other helpful things. But that does not make up for the fact that it will take a lot longer for a new player to level up higher. They added "The Forge", the new way of leveling up items, it is complete fụcking bụllshỉt. So now if you want to be strong and have high level armour, your going to have to pay money for fire crystals, otherwise it will take you a long fụcking time.\n\nFinishing comments:\nI've played this game for a few years and it was mostly worth it. But the devs fụcked up the game and my money I put towards it was a waste. So if you are a new player and/or if you are starting the game, it will take quite a while to get to a high level.\n\n(Note that the last time I played this game was about a year ago so things may have changed.)","June 6, 2014","false","91.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","3"

The amount of "game money" you can aquire at low level is not enough to feed the "Energy required to play" mechanic. This forces you to pay real money for the energy at an online store, or wait 24 hours to "recharge". As a result, players are forced to logout, and play something else. No MMO should limit the amount of time and effort a player can invest in a game per 24-hour period.\n\nThis game is for the very casual player that only occasionally logs in.

SK has a funny gameplay and also good style in gaming.\n\nBut the big and really very MAIN bad thing about this game are the "lacks of usefull updates". The sample can you see by myself, let me explain:\n\n-Im a Gunslinger and use my stuff i own now over 2 years coz i still wait that new gear i COULD use comes in...and 2 years are a very very VERY long time where you get boring about this game...\n\nIt gives updates but this ones are not very use full, mostly an "recolor update from the whatthehellknows-version of an gear it already gives" - and that only in a cosmetic way. Other updates are pretty much useless if you saw them for one day...\n\nSo at the end: you -CAN- play SK, its a pretty GOOD game BUT if you finished ALL, its DONE - and there is no hope a good update will come fix this.\n\nSo if you play MMOs like Guild Wars 2 or like, you should give up SK after you finished SKs "Last Mission" coz unlike other MMOs, there is nothing more to play for...\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEDIT (12.04.14 - Day of the Gunner Update):\nAnd they finally bought out the gunner update after over a year of waiting. But what is it? Its sadly to say but...even the Gunner update are just reskined WEAPONS with other kind of dmg output. Like the normal Blaster now with shadow/ele/pec dmg and other weapons like a shadow dmg-Autogun.\n\nThey also brought out now new armors/helmets but you must get down in the dungeon to get the recieps for them (the guns too).\n\nFor NEW players i say maybe nice thing, for the real OLD players its a pain in the ♥♥♥.

After about a year of off and on playing, I got into the game more and more for the merchanting aspect. Here's where the problem lies, though. Three Rings (OOO) Is more focused on providing small bits of insignificant content raher than providing a substantial story to the game or anything larger than a few model remakes for events that dish out "Prize Boxes" if you buy the premium currency.\n\nLater on, people find out about unique variants, which is the main money sink for the game. So in order to get the best gear, you need to grind for hours just to get the 20 thousand Crowns (F2P Currency) just to get one.\n\nIn the end, it's a fun game but there are much better games out there for a free to play fanatic.","November 27, 2013","false","466.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

It can be somewhat of an acquired taste, but overall the soundtrack is gud.\n+Really neat skyboxes. Though said skyboxes will turn your computer into a toaster if you have a crap-tier AMD graphics card.\n+Chibi artstyle. I've never been really scared by any of the enemies due to this, though a few have their creepy side, such as the spectral felines you'll find in haunted zones.\n+The community (ingame and on the official Spiral Knights Forums) is generally welcoming and helpful, though there are a few loud complaints about various things at times. Can hold decent, respectable conversations with other players.\n+Smooth character control using the mouse.\n+Makes you not want to kill the rare enemies that can occasionally drop special loot. This is something I don't see often, as it turns the killing-things cash-grab into a "this thing doesn't hurt you; are you really gonna kill it?" scenario.\n+Wide variety of armor and weaponry to create, although you have to work for it.\n+Every single obtainable item save for armor accessories has its own peculiar flavor text. These can be fun for trivia enthusiasts.\n+The developers will occasionally take ideas from the official forums pages and incorporate them into the game, though this can be a rare occurrence.\n+Lots of alliteration and a few puns here and there. Mostly in the names of different dungeons and the flavor texts of certain items.\n+The storyline is fragmented, but the shards of its canon are dynamic. Spaceflight from a genocidal war, a mysterious crash-landing on a celestial body of machinery and nature, an oligarchal dictatorship bent to its rulers' own twisted design, a tortured, fiery Duke of a smoldering kingdom, forever believing his realm is under siege...all of this is part of the world the player characters live in.\n+Sentient jelly cubes with mustaches\n+helicopter birds\n+tree physics have yet to make any sense, as the leaves aren't attached to the trunk. good stuff.\n+demons throw office supplies at you. Only the disgruntled overtime-workers use pitchforks.\n+I'm pretty sure that putting a rocket engine on a war-hammer is the greatest achievement weaponry has to offer.\n\nNow for the cons.\n-Development of the game has slowed to a crawl. Although the major updates are impressive, they come few and far between, and as such there hasn't been much to accomplish once endgame is reached. This is a major contention with players who lack a certain amount of patience.\n-Promotional "costume" items are produced more often than game updates. This, too, leads to negative feelings toward the developers, as the costume items can only be acquired using real-world funds. Though it does lead to a huge variety of player costumes and personalized outfits. I haven't seen a single other player that dresses their character the same as mine.\n-Many of the weapons have a certain niche in the game, but there is a significant quality fluctuation when it comes to how well the small group of most-effective weapons function as opposed to the great variety of others.\n-Few money-making stages. There is one particular endgame dungeon that is the most effective way to earn ingame currency sans trading, but as there are no other stages to rival its payout, playing the dungeon can become increasingly repetitive.\n-The comment sections on Steam for most of the promotional costume updates are a veritable maelstrom of angry players. Being a repeatedly-returning player requires extraordinary patience.\n-PvP can be difficult unless you're extremely good at it.\n\nOverall, if you play the game without expecting much new content to be released in a set period of time, it's a good 8/10. For those of you with less patience with the dev team, probably not the game for you.\n\n\n\n\n","January 17","true","217.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You are a small knight who has crash landed on a strange planet and must get to safety. Once that is done you go through certain missions and delve into the clockworks, a massive underground mix of levels that are ever-changing. I have almost 700 hours into Spiral Knights because it was extremely intriguing and I would play 12 hours without even realizing it. However, the lack of content being added is saddening, especially when we get constant "prize boxes" for every 10 dollars we spend with our hard-earned money. Besides that point it can be extremely hard to level up your gear.  Going from Tier 1 gear to Tier 5 took almost 400 hours alone. However, this was before the missions gave you a free set of recipes and crafting orbs. The crafting orbs were what replaced Energy in crafting. Energy was about 500x harder to get.\nThis game is VERY good with a group of friends (4 preferably) since the drops chances are higher and everyone gets their own loot. I do recommend this game because besides all the weak points, it is still very fun to slash, shoot, and spam bombs all around the battlefield.\n\n8/10","March 10, 2014","true","710.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Starts with a single player tutorial and then sends you to a city with all the other people playing online. The game itself consists of three tiers, each unlocked by crafting better gear to your knight. If you decide to buy energy with real money, you'll be getting better gear and unlocking tiers much faster, but it's still completely possible to unlock all tiers in reasonable amount of time by not using money. A part of the game reminds me of Team Fortress 2. It features crafting and trading which add to the variety of the game. You can craft gear that is strong against certain types of enemies to make beating certain boss stages easier.

There's also ways to hang around with friends and socializing with new ones as you play through the game.

The world and setting has potential, but the dungeon system gets repetative after a bit. It would be much better if it was like other MMORPGs, where there's a vast world to explore.\n-There's a microtrasaction item (usually a box and key) that comes out every so often. It unlocks an item that customizes your character. It's similar to gambling in CSGO and TF2. I've never bought it before. The only problem is that not much development is put into the game and seeing that that's the only thing that gets updated month after month is disappointing.\n-There's no way to move the camera and jump.\n\nFINAL NOTES\n-It's not for everyone though. I wanted to play it with multiple friends over the years and many of them immediately refused to play based off the pictures.\n-I hope this game gets remade because I'd love to see a better version of it. It has potential. Add in jumping, a moveable camera that's also not so far out, a vast world rather than dungeons, skills, classes, races, more towns, jetpacks, things to do other than fighting, etc., and I think a lot of people would enjoy it.","December 7, 2015","true","51.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","1"

It's like a combination between Legend of Zelda and Chibi.\n- Great, atmospheric music.\n- Solid gameplay.\n- Friendly community.\n- Shadow Lairs.\n- Intriguing story. (Can't wait for the other rank missions!)\n- Can be really fun when playing with friends.\n- It is indeed a F2P. You can obtain most of the weapons and the equipment and even cosmetics by paying no money. But it'll get harder. Trust me, it will.\n\nCONS:\n\n- After you become a Vanguard, things can get pretty dull.\n- Game encourages you to grind. And by that, I mean a LOT of grinding.\n- Connection problems. (Note: if you're from Australia or somewhere in Asia, expect a lot of trouble playing this game.)\n- Can sometimes get boring.\n- Not much activity when it comes to content.\n- Price boxes. A CRAP-TON of Costume price boxes.\n- SEGA. Crap.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\n\nI'll give this game a 8.5/10.\nIt's not a flawless gem, but it's a solid game that can bring you lots of joy.\nAnd while I don't really play SK that much nowadays like I once did before (problably it has to do with the lack of content and school, of course), I can say that Spiral Knights has a special place in my heart.\nMet lots of great people, had tons of fun, joined a great guild (League of Gunners) and so on.\n\nSo yeah, that's pretty much my opinion about it.\nI know it's not really detailed, but whatever.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nYours truly,\nMordekai the Summoner (Siliuser in SK)\n\nP.S: To all of my friends I've met in SK and are reading this,\nThank you and love you all, fellas :3\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nUPDATE: 13th of April, 2016 (I know, a bit late announcing this news.)\n\nSpiral Knights has now been bought by Gray Havens (a company formed by former employers of OOO).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwenyvier/recommended/99900/","gwenyvier","Gwenyvier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwenyvier/","160 products in account","I would really like to be able to promote this game, but I can't. If it was about 2+ years ago I could, but that is not the case.\n\nFirst thing, do not be mislead by my amount of hours played. I started SK before it was brought to Steam, and refused to link my main account to my Steam account due to perpetual connectivity issues between the two. I have more hours logged on SK than I have on Terraria and Mincraft combined.\n\nThey have changed the tutorial area from when I started, it is admittedly much better now. Has a minor storyline and teaches you how to use your various abilities. The game is much more approachable for newbies. Which is a definite plus. The removal of the energy system to do levels also means that newbies aren't restricted to 10 floors at max before they have to quit for about 24 hours (or pay money). That is all definite pluses.\n\nThe issues start about mid-tier, or 3-star gear. 3-star fire crystals and alchemy orbs are incredibly hard to find. Too early and you get 2-star stuff, if you do the boss areas odds are you will get 4-star stuff... and you don't get the recipe to downgrade the 4-star fire crystals to 3-star until AFTER a mision that requires you to level up 3-star gear enough to be in full 4-star gear. This is a minor setback, the big setback is high tier equipment. You need 5-star alchemy orbs and fire crystals for that, and unlike earlier tiers you can not downgrade higher crystals to make them. To fully level a single piece of 5-star equipment is going to cost you 453 fire crystals... or about 50 runs of the boss mission. You have at minimum a shield, 2 weapons, armor, and helmet, at maximum 2 more weapons. So that is a minimum of 250 boss mission runs, or 350 at maximum. And that is just for your starting set of gear.\n\nBut they don't want you to grind all that... they want you to buy the crystals. 50 5-star fire crystals costs 700 energy (cash shop currency), which is about 10-12 runs of the boss mission I mentioned, converting in game currency to cash shop currency (via a player run market). AKA NOT CHEAP!\n\nThey introduced pets at one point, reworking the mineral system (which originally were used to help influence the dungeons and get you some easy currency as well) into a way to feed and level the pets. There are 3 color pets: red, purple, and yellow. There are 5 colored minerals... 2 of which, blue and green, have absolutely zero use.\n\nThere are floors that are just horribly annoying to do, too high difficulty for too little payout. They're nice to experience, but a lot of groups will actively avoid them, to the point of waiting at the elevator at the end of a floor for 10 minutes to avoid such bad floors. Some floors, are amazingly fun. A lot of people hate Candlestick Keep, where an immortal ghost chases you, but I find them fun. Arenas are a blast, along with various other areas. But in comparison you can get Treasure Vaults... which are junk ironically, Compounds that are full of minis and are incredibly annoying, or Fiend floors... which a lot of people despise.\n\nThe last constantly available boss was introduced well over 2 years ago. There are minor bosses you can fight once for daily missions, but actual bosses you can just decide to go fight there has not been a new one in ages. There has been more gear added, but it is mostly reskins of other weapons with stat changes. And its hard to level due to the incredibly annoying fire crystal system.\n\nPVP is even worse, it is dominated by people that have quite literally dropped $100s into the game by now. They have the best gear possible, my gear is high end (and I can do fairly well against them) but their stuff puts mine to shame, for the casual player you are just going to get beaten into the ground repeatedly. In addition to that if you don't have accessory slots (cash shop only!) than you are going to be at an even bigger disadvantage as everybody runs with health booster accessories.\n\nOn a sadder note, the game is dying. It started when the chief developer left, and now various other devs have as well. At one point it was not uncommon to see a dozen instances of the town going. For one event my guild saw over 70 instances running. Now you are lucky to get 3, and none of them are showing as full.\n\nI really, REALLY want to be able to recommend this game... but I can't, not anymore. I love the art style, it is unique and cute and colorful. I love the music, Candlestick Keep has incredibly creepy but whimsical sounding music, the Wildwoods has beautifully fitting music for how its designed. I greatly like the atmosphere of the game, especially some of the areas created during the game's prime. The Wildwoods look amazing, as much as I dislike Compounds they look fantastic, and the Void is nicely threatening. The combat is fairly balanced in PVE until you hit high end. But I still can't recommend the game. Too many things have changed that just make it not player friendly anymore, and it shows.\n\nEdit: And the game just got bought from Sega by a company called Grey Havens. Hopefully it will be good for the game, but it might be too little too late, only time will tell on that one.","June 4","false","5.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

I've gone through hard times, and good times. This game is a bit harder on Veterans now, and rewards new players with many free things, which I don't find fair, but that's not my decision to make. If you don't have this game, you need it. If you love MMO's, get it, RPG's, get it. This game is a must have for a fan of either of those. There are many different armors to use, from using swords, to guns, to bombs, and even some event weapons. The costumes are amazingly designed, and playing with the right people can lead to domination.\nThe DLC, Operation Crimson Hammer, is also amazing. It provides a new boss, new missions, and exclusive weapons. I've played since 2011 and still haven't gotten all of the exclusive items from this. Because everything in the DLC is a challenge, or a cake walk.\nEverything in this game depends on your gear, play your cards right, and you can win almost anything.","April 16, 2014","true","144.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

I got it near when it just released, and I was very impressed and excited about it. However, since I can't give numeral or decimal ratings, I have to choose what I think of the game now: I just can't recommend it. I'll tell you why my love has been watered down as we go.\n\nYou and many other robotic knights crashed on a mysterious planet. This is no ordinary planet; the massive underground is filled with massive machines and gears that are constantly shifting levels. It's sometimes gloomy, sometimes cheery. It is inhabited with many monsters and gremlins who don't want you to explore. This place is called the Clockworks. In its center is your only hope of escape: the energy from the core.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nNewbies get to customize their character with various cosmetic armors and ascessories. You can change your knight's color, which affects your eye color and any parts of armors that allow change. You can also change their height.\n\nBy default you start with Proto gear, which includes an armor (this covers your body), a helmet, a shield, and two weapons: the Proto Sword and Proto Gun. You are taken through a tutorial that teaches you how to kill meanies and the beginning of your story. Following the tutorial are beginner missions with AI companions to give you a taste of the game and its story before you go on your own. These missions are pretty easy to do and reward you with more weapons to help you on your journey. At the end, you are taken to Haven and you get the Proto Bomb, which is the last type of weapon (swords, guns, and bombs). Haven is located at the surface and is where the knights research and train.\n\nMore missions can be done later when you are ready. These too will give you rewards. Complete a set of missions to be ranked up and move on to the next set. Ranks allow you to use better gear. Gear is ranked in stars like a movie would be rated. Most weapons can be upgraded to higher levels. Some ranks require you to have a full set of gear of a certain rank for you to continue to the next and to allow you to go down more tiers. Tiers are chunks of depths with sharp difficulty turns. There are 3 tiers in all. Missions can be replayed again and again as much as you want. You can also independantly delve down the clockworks.\n\nThere's two currencies in this game (I know what you're thinking): Crowns and energy. Crowns is earned in the Clockworks or by selling things. You use them to buy equipment from shops or you can trade them for energy. Energy is used mainly for reviving yourself if you die or for buying things in the Supply Depot. The Supply Depot is where you get to look at all the things you cannot get because you got no $$$ in your wallet. Energy can be traded for crowns and bought with real money (mhm, you see the picture now).\n\nYou can delve the clockworks solo or with 4 player co-op. To beat each level, you have to reach the elevator at the end of each level, which you can use to either continue going down or go back up. There's many areas to explore each level, and you can find materials to "alchemize" new weapons or upgrade weapons. You only have one emergency revive, so be careful! You can buy sparks of life to revive you again if you need to with energy, which are available in the Supply Depot to buy. Sometimes you will run into a set of levels with a boss at the end. You will seldom run into the same level twice, as the levels change constantly at set times. The elevators give you a hint on the type of level it will be by the picture and color of the picture displayed on the screen on it. For example, a haunted fortress themed level would be a castle tower with either purple or red. Purple would be a little generic, and red will usually mean the Scarlet Fortress levels. Further information on the level ahead is given to you when you go down, such as the name of the "series" (I call more specific themed places like the Scarlet Fortress [a haunted, castle-like level] a series) and an area name (Firestorm Citadel: Smouldering Steps).\n\nNear the end of the game comes the Shadow Lairs. The Shadow Lairs require a Shadow Key to enter. One key grants access for everyone in the party. These are boss levels with massive difficulty changes that make even the beginner's boss a challenge for a full party of 5 star players. On top of that are more powerful monsters and enhanced bosses. There's one for each boss. Each Shadow Lair opens the core little by little.\n\nPvP is also a thing here. In the coliseum, you can pay 200 crowns (which is extremely cheap for most players) to play Lockdown or Blast Network. In Lockdown, you can be one of three classes with their own unique abilities that replace your shield (Guardian has a massive shield that protects allies) on two randomly colored teams. All your gear can be used they aside from your shield, but their level goes down to level 1 until you're done playing. You win by capturing and controlling control points. Blast Network is Bomberman. Nuff said.\n\nThe game was really fun and the boss runs were wonderfully done, but there's two evil beasts: GRINDING FOR ALL ETERNITY AND DLC. Beginners will have a blast with the game until later in the game, where upgrades are harder and take longer to do. Your gear can level up and become stronger with "heat" which acts like experience points. However, you can't just breeze through and max out your gear because they can only actually go up a level when they're at full heat and you have enough fire crystals. This is magnificent part is called "forging". There's special fire crystals for each star gear, the better ones being harder to find. 4 and 5 star fire crystals are extremely hard to find, and you need frikkin tens of them depending on the level. Even then, you have the option to use less fire crystals for a lower chance of forging or using a crapton at once to confidently move up a level. Unless you have a massive horde of crystals, you'll probably want to go with the 100% chance option all the time. Even worse, 3 to 5 star gear *require* that you level up your gear to a certain level. 5 star gear requires you to max them out (level 10 is the max), and 5 star gear is *always* slightly less strong than their 4 star counterparts until you can level them up enough for them to actually be better aside from a good charge attack, which almost never changes. It takes me about ONE MONTH or more of collecting materials, leveling up gear, and grinding the same boss levels over and over for money and loot just for ONE 5 star piece of equipment. Guess what the Supply Depot has? 5 star weapons for sale for energy. Remember what I said about occasional gear requirements in missions? R.I.P. your wallet.\n\nGuess what else? Shadow Keys cost a lot of energy. That means you better find an efficient way to earn money or pull out your wallet just to beat the game with a couple of friends. When you have nothing else to do but the Shadow Lairs, you can enjoy grinding for 600 years or lose the roof over your head. Another thing: events. Events and prize boxes. I don't need to say anything else about these. It's a tiny bit like the vicious IAP that ruins almost every mobile game you love.\n\nGRAPHICS, UI, AND PERFORMANCE\n\nGraphically, the game looks great. The gear, environment, and overall art style is really neat. The UI has no problems. As for performance, the game runs perfectly on my 5 year old Dell laptop with no upgrades on low settings. It appears to be well optimized. If I had a newer computer, it would be perfect. No strikes off here.\n\nThere you have it. A great game with painful grinding. I give this game a 6.8/10, and I don't recommend it because I don't like being enslaved in grinding for years or PC games + mobile IAP. I'd also like it if I could actually do some cool stuff aside from the Shadow Lairs and getting gear as a Tier 3 player.","June 21, 2015","false","429.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

I tried this game a few year ago (2011 maybe?) and decided to give it another go recently.  This game still hit me in a weird way with pros that could be seen as cons, and in my opinion the cons that maybe could be seen as pros.  For instance, it uses a slow replenishing energy system which is depleted with almost EVERY action you take from using items in the world to crafting to runining dungeons (con) but hey, maybe people won't spend their entire day inside playing games (pro)? Let us do the list thing.\nPROS-\n-I love the zelda games, almost to the point of fighting for human/machine marriage equality, and this game's style reminds me a lot of earlier games.  This made me all warm and tingly inside.\n-There aren't any set roles in the game, the holy trio does not exist.  Everyone can do the dps thing, tank if needed and by the gods hopefully grab the insane amounts of health that drops to keep themself alive.\n-The graphics are bright and cartoony, which I'm not usually all for, but it seems too many games now are trying to see how dark and bleak they can make the environment, this seemed kinda refreshing.\n-The combat is fast paced and fun.  Being able to switch between a gun and a sword when ever I felt like gave me the ability to strategize. (Not that strategy is needed, the game is laughably easy)\nCONS- (some can be seen as pros depending on how you look at it)\n-Ingame voice chat.  My god i hate ingame voice chat. If i wanted to hear your whiney, prepubescent voice I would join a real  voice chat program and listen to you there.  I have a feeling it was implemented to help players organize and easily communicate a strategy (again haha strategy), not to bewail that every person in the randomly genterated group doesn't have the map memorized. (which was me sometimes... What? I like exploring damnit!)\n----actually had a kid during a dungeon yelling at this player to hurry up and run to the portal so we could continue. You could feel the anxiety of the lost player and the pure hatred of the player rushing other along, i mean his mom was going to be home from work in 8 minutes, he HAS to finish this dungeon before that!  The best part was his squeeling COOOME ON as the other player and I decided to go retrieve our lost dungeon brother.----\n-The energy system. the free to play version gives you a small pool of energy that is used for every single thing you do in the game, so it depletes pretty quickly and has a slloowww regen rate.  Of course, you can use real currency to pay for more energy or pay insane amounts of in-game currency for it.\n-Grinding. Once you get past the T2 dungeons, you will be grinding your way from there on out.  Which is a painful experience with the energy system inplace.

However, I found this simplicity to give it a lack of depth which made it boring after a while, but I always tend to get bored with mmo's after a while. The later introduction of Battle Sprites somewhat emulates the class systems of traditional mmo's. This is a good thing, I think. Mmo veterans expect at least something resembling a class system. Newbies should be introduced to this as soon as possible, as mmo's that don't have it are the exceptions. And it was good for the game itself to add much-needed depth. The amount of grinding required to fully level your Sprite, unfortunately, is ridiculous. Feels like a Korean mmo in that respect. The problem of a free-to-play game economy was handled well by making the cash shop currency purchasable with ingame currency, and shop currency required for crafting and adventuring. Overall, however, I find the most attractive part of this game to be its visual style.","July 5, 2014","false","404.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'm not saying it's in all of them, but it usually is. Sure, Spiral Knights has a ton of grinding: but the pay out of finally being able to upgrade your equipment is oh-so satisfying.\n\nOverall, I would totally recommend this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/99900/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nSpiral knights is an MMO-dungeon crawler, unlike most MMO's that I play, This game suggests you play public games (but I just found the option that lets me solo! Thank you for letting me play my own way Spiral Knights). Additionally it automatically activates your microphone (I found out to my dismay on my second run, after I had been idly chatting with a friend on skype… and hearing an echo of my voice.)\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  From the state of the game, you get to customize your Spiral Knight, change his/her helmet make adjustments to the color, and then maybe throw on a few accessories. Once you’re finished you perform various tasks around camp to get things running again.\n\nGame Play: You play the game like a dungeon crawler, you can also choose between three different control configurations. I chose to use the keyboard and mouse; the controls seem very straightforward and natural to me. You can switch between different weapons once you buy them later in the game; you start the game out with a pistol and a sword. No complaint I see no need for any other weapons.\nHopefully I don’t need to spell it out more about how the combat works, you shoot from far away with the pistol, you hit them with your sword in melee range, you block stuff with your shield, and you also have bombs that you can drop. You can also unlock, buy, and make new weapons and armor.\nAt rank 3 you start to be informed about the different types of gear you can wear. Since it’s an MMO, I assume this will play a larger role in the game further on. At the time that I am writing this review, I reached Shadow gear (which the game so kindly provided for me as I continued down the main story line. As long as the game doesn’t force me to spend real money, I’m okay with the gear based structure for this game.\n\nAchievements: A majority of the achievements require collection of X amount of gear. There are a lot of hidden achievements that I will need to research once I get to be a higher level. Although I suspect that the game will eventually force me to team up with other players… and then let the ugly pugging commence. (Sorry, for those who don’t know: I really hate playing with people I don’t know.)\nBasically, my impression is that the achievements reflect the amount of time you’ve spent playing the game. I was about a third of my way through the story, and I had about a third of the achievements in the game.\n\nPrice: Ah ha! This game is a Free to play! You have no real excuse for not trying it at least once. Since the game can be soloed (at least to where I’m at, one third complete) I think you can get a decent amount of entertainment out of the game, if you like dungeon crawlers, and a really simple easy game to pick up.\n\nConclusion: There really isn’t much reason to say “don’t get this game” especially since it’s free. I keep waiting for the point in the game where it says “HA! To be continued! Now pay us money just like you did the Arcade machine when you were little!” Nothing like that yet, so regardless, I feel I’ve gotten a fair amount of entertainment out of a game I didn’t buy.\nNo complaints, I’m enjoying the game still. (but I will always grind before I ever spend real money inside a game of any kind.)","June 7, 2014","true","51.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Spiral Knights is a top-down, 2.5D (Can you call it 2.5D? Maybe it's more 3D than anything...) P2P Er I mean *Cough* F2P MMORPG where you run around and kick some monster butt like you did back in the days of the SNES with Legend of Zelda...but with a much better combat system (you would think). Lets start with the basics.\n(Read farther if you please. Basic Synopsis- Casual gamer=SK is a good choice. Want more polish? Keep looking.\n1; Graphics 7.5/10\nNot exactly the greatest but not the worst either. What really makes this game so inviting is it's art style which is btw AMAZING! Everything looks awesome even though textures, models, and shading aren't top notch.\n2; Community ?/?\nI never really had anything to do with the community...maybe played every once 'n a while with strangers but I never really traded with anyone and that crap. Maybe someone else could answer that for you Mr/Ms viewer of my review (Really? I had to break the 4th wall?)\n3; Soundtrack/SoundEffects 8/10\nThe sound track is really good. It has this feel of going on an adventure and discovering things like what a game like this should be. Every level has a nice theme that plays well with it, from volcanic forests to frozen devilite business offices to a ruin full of slimes. The sound effects are good too. Not much else to say for the sounds.\n4;Leveling system.... Doesn't even need a rating....\nFirst off, WHY DOES TAKE ME A YEAR JUST SO I CAN GO UP ONE GOD DARN RANK!?!?!? Before that I was zipping through the ranks like it was nothing! Then I got stuck trying to get to 4*, and I had to play for what like ages just so i could get my 5* armor.  I'm not saying that having to work to get to your rank is bad, but they way it has been implemented in this present edition of SK is ridiculous. Before (I'm sure most of you already know this who have been reading the reviews for hours now) the game had you collect heat (exp) that leveled up you're gear. What happened when it capped? IT LEVELED UP! WOW! IT CAN LEVEL UP! What happens now? You cap...and have to play for another 3 months just so you can get some stupid fire cyrstals to level up your gear BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE! NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO GRIND FOREVER, YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO FAIL IN THE FORGE AND HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN! Isn't that just the sweetest thing ever.....NO! And the only thing you can do to make it work is have so much fire crystals for a 100% chance rate of working. I hate it so much. Oh and if you think I'm lying about spending months leveling up you just wait until you're Knight Elite...you just wait.\n5; Gameplay 8/10\nThe gameplay is pretty solid. Basic 123 slash with pistol and a choice of using an explosive (which are overpowered if used with the right loadout). You can dogde and shield bash and defend and is relativley solid. Now, don't get GAMEPLAY confused with "Difficulty." In reality, the game isn't that hard, and it functions well. Now...for the really negative stuff.\n6; "Difficulty" 2/10\n.....Where do I start...Hm...I know. You know those things called defenses on your armor, like elemental defense, pierce defense, shadow defense, those things? Yeah um...those don't matter at all. If you play the game on normal you "should" be fine, advanced you might need some help, and expert you're going to need a really good loadout with lightning reflexes and friends who have a ton of sparks (I'll get to sparks soon enough). Now, why did I say "should" for normal....well here's the thing.....All difficulties, have the same amount of enemies....and there are ALOT of enemies...and they do the SAME amount of damage no matter what difficulty...the difficulty just decides how much health they have. They do the same amount of damage because of the game's elevator and depths. The elevator is your level transition, and you're depths are you're "difficulty." That little slide bar does nothing except make a tier 1 gremlin take 3 hits instead of 2 and alter the spawn rate of certain drops. So you will constantly be having to fight what looks like 15 zombies at all times that do the same amount of damage at that specific depth. Forgot to mention why you're defenses don't matter...they don't matter because of what has just been stated and, you don't just face the enemies specified in the level, you fight ALTERED enemies as well. So instead of fighting a Elemental only Gremlin, you'll fight an Elemental Shadow Gremlin. O_o What? But...I have the armor? Nope. Doesn't matter. The only difference is instead of taking half a health bar they take like a quarter. The only thing I have to say is awesome is being able to live with 1% health. If you are MLG enough to play this game with 1% health I salute you! You can't get 1 shotted by enemies because of this, all you need is above 1% to land in that "Crisis mode."\n7; Enemyvariaty/Enemies  8/10-1/10\nLets just get this straight, there are alot of creative enemies with alot uniqueness to them. They are pretty darn cool. You fight little devils, zombies, ghost cats, horse statues, bats, slimes, wolfs, etc. This game has a cool list of enemies! Right? Right? RIGHT?!?! Yeah....the'yre cool till rank Knight Elite. Then they get kind of challenging....next rank...Forget about it. These enemies are so freaking annoying. And it wouldn't be a problem IF YOU COULD CONNECT YOUR 3RD STRIKE WITHOUT HAVING TO BACK THEM INTO A CORNER! BTW YOU CAN'T, CAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE IN THE CORNER! Devilites suck royally, I hate them, Gremlins suck aswell cause they can dodge and crap have sheilds on their back and stun you with every hit they can hit you, zombies just have really powerful strikes, ghost cats are annoying cause they fly all over the place, wolvers are the only one's free of scrutiny, good dogs, slimes are bull, bats are cheap shotting little jerks, robots are broken, and turrets will kill you more than any other enemy if you go farther than Knight Elite. Let me go in depth for you all... Zombies can do a pounce attack, that will literally ♥♥♥♥ you're health bar to 1% if you do not have the right armor (which you probably don't and they are all over the place), Ghost cats fly here there every where and can't hit for the life of you, and if you hit 4* area not only do they fly around and bite, but they shoot really slow pellets of death, and fake you out like you're playing some strange version of Street Fighter 4 Ultra Whose Gives A Crap 2.5D Top Down Edition! It's ridiculous! Oh wait, that title actually belongs to the robots! The robots, are you're bane. Everyone's bane. Why? They are the PVE equivilant to you'reself. Lockdown is PVP, this is PVE. And knowing what most people know is that the computer can READ YOU'RE VERY THOUGHTS THROUGH YOUR KEYBOARD/GAMEPAD/MOUSE! It's either the robots play smart, or they decide to go #YOLOSWAG (<----- is gay btw ;) ) and beat you to death. Another thing, Hit...Stun????? REALLY???!?!? Every time you get hit, you take hit stun. In the middle of an attack? Don't worry! We'll completley interupt you mid swing and take half your health! Seriously? I thought this was going to be like zelda where you open chests and go DUH DUH DDUUUUUHHH!!! I had no idea that this game would take things from fighting games!?!?! Granted hit stun is in games and they work. But why does it not work here? No invincibilty frames. None. Nodda. Zilch. Correction, you have what seems to be .5 seconds of Invulnerability before you can get whacked again. So in a sense....You have none! What's really funny is the standard enemies ARE HARDER THAN THE BOSSES THEMSELVES! The enemies are unpredictable, while the bosses have set patterns and can be memorized. I personally think this game should have been a game where you go on a boss run all the time.\nBasic synopsis- If you're a casual gamer, then this game is great for you. If you're a gamer who likes a little more polish, keep looking.\n\n","July 12, 2014","false","299.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

Spiral Knights is a top-down, 2.5D (Can you call it 2.5D? Maybe it's more 3D than anything...) P2P Er I mean *Cough* F2P MMORPG where you run around and kick some monster butt like you did back in the days of the SNES with Legend of Zelda...but with a much better combat system (you would think). Lets start with the basics.\n(Read farther if you please. Basic Synopsis- Casual gamer=SK is a good choice. Want more polish? Keep looking.\n1; Graphics 7.5/10\nNot exactly the greatest but not the worst either. What really makes this game so inviting is it's art style which is btw AMAZING! Everything looks awesome even though textures, models, and shading aren't top notch.\n2; Community ?/?\nI never really had anything to do with the community...maybe played every once 'n a while with strangers but I never really traded with anyone and that crap. Maybe someone else could answer that for you Mr/Ms viewer of my review (Really? I had to break the 4th wall?)\n3; Soundtrack/SoundEffects 8/10\nThe sound track is really good. It has this feel of going on an adventure and discovering things like what a game like this should be. Every level has a nice theme that plays well with it, from volcanic forests to frozen devilite business offices to a ruin full of slimes. The sound effects are good too. Not much else to say for the sounds.\n4;Leveling system.... Doesn't even need a rating....\nFirst off, WHY DOES TAKE ME A YEAR JUST SO I CAN GO UP ONE GOD DARN RANK!?!?!? Before that I was zipping through the ranks like it was nothing! Then I got stuck trying to get to 4*, and I had to play for what like ages just so i could get my 5* armor.  I'm not saying that having to work to get to your rank is bad, but they way it has been implemented in this present edition of SK is ridiculous. Before (I'm sure most of you already know this who have been reading the reviews for hours now) the game had you collect heat (exp) that leveled up you're gear. What happened when it capped? IT LEVELED UP! WOW! IT CAN LEVEL UP! What happens now? You cap...and have to play for another 3 months just so you can get some stupid fire cyrstals to level up your gear BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE! NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO GRIND FOREVER, YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO FAIL IN THE FORGE AND HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN! Isn't that just the sweetest thing ever.....NO! And the only thing you can do to make it work is have so much fire crystals for a 100% chance rate of working. I hate it so much. Oh and if you think I'm lying about spending months leveling up you just wait until you're Knight Elite...you just wait.\n5; Gameplay 8/10\nThe gameplay is pretty solid. Basic 123 slash with pistol and a choice of using an explosive (which are overpowered if used with the right loadout). You can dogde and shield bash and defend and is relativley solid. Now, don't get GAMEPLAY confused with "Difficulty." In reality, the game isn't that hard, and it functions well. Now...for the really negative stuff.\n6; "Difficulty" 2/10\n.....Where do I start...Hm...I know. You know those things called defenses on your armor, like elemental defense, pierce defense, shadow defense, those things? Yeah um...those don't matter at all. If you play the game on normal you "should" be fine, advanced you might need some help, and expert you're going to need a really good loadout with lightning reflexes and friends who have a ton of sparks (I'll get to sparks soon enough). Now, why did I say "should" for normal....well here's the thing.....All difficulties, have the same amount of enemies....and there are ALOT of enemies...and they do the SAME amount of damage no matter what difficulty...the difficulty just decides how much health they have. They do the same amount of damage because of the game's elevator and depths. The elevator is your level transition, and you're depths are you're "difficulty." That little slide bar does nothing except make a tier 1 gremlin take 3 hits instead of 2 and alter the spawn rate of certain drops. So you will constantly be having to fight what looks like 15 zombies at all times that do the same amount of damage at that specific depth. Forgot to mention why you're defenses don't matter...they don't matter because of what has just been stated and, you don't just face the enemies specified in the level, you fight ALTERED enemies as well. So instead of fighting a Elemental only Gremlin, you'll fight an Elemental Shadow Gremlin. O_o What? But...I have the armor? Nope. Doesn't matter. The only difference is instead of taking half a health bar they take like a quarter. The only thing I have to say is awesome is being able to live with 1% health. If you are MLG enough to play this game with 1% health I salute you! You can't get 1 shotted by enemies because of this, all you need is above 1% to land in that "Crisis mode."\n7; Enemyvariaty/Enemies  8/10-1/10\nLets just get this straight, there are alot of creative enemies with alot uniqueness to them. They are pretty darn cool. You fight little devils, zombies, ghost cats, horse statues, bats, slimes, wolfs, etc. This game has a cool list of enemies! Right? Right? RIGHT?!?! Yeah....the'yre cool till rank Knight Elite. Then they get kind of challenging....next rank...Forget about it. These enemies are so freaking annoying. And it wouldn't be a problem IF YOU COULD CONNECT YOUR 3RD STRIKE WITHOUT HAVING TO BACK THEM INTO A CORNER! BTW YOU CAN'T, CAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE IN THE CORNER! Devilites suck royally, I hate them, Gremlins suck aswell cause they can dodge and crap have sheilds on their back and stun you with every hit they can hit you, zombies just have really powerful strikes, ghost cats are annoying cause they fly all over the place, wolvers are the only one's free of scrutiny, good dogs, slimes are bull, bats are cheap shotting little jerks, robots are broken, and turrets will kill you more than any other enemy if you go farther than Knight Elite. Let me go in depth for you all... Zombies can do a pounce attack, that will literally ♥♥♥♥ you're health bar to 1% if you do not have the right armor (which you probably don't and they are all over the place), Ghost cats fly here there every where and can't hit for the life of you, and if you hit 4* area not only do they fly around and bite, but they shoot really slow pellets of death, and fake you out like you're playing some strange version of Street Fighter 4 Ultra Whose Gives A Crap 2.5D Top Down Edition!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tyrothefox/recommended/99900/","tyrothefox","[EPN] Tyro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tyrothefox/","236 products in account","Hmm...Well, umm...\n\nI like Spiral Knights, To keep this as short as I can because I'm sure your busy, this is the one MMO that clicked. Mabinogi is nice and WoW is fine while DC Universe Online gives you too much too soon, Spiral Knights keeps be coming back.\n\nFirstly, I love the art style. It looks wonderful. Every weapon might seem a little 'fisher price' for others tastes but there's the extra details on them to give them a battle-worn feel. Plus, there's a clear progression in how each equipment changes as it upgrades. It's like Pokemon and it's satisfying.\n\nThe world seems vast and enjoyable that I think Three Rings have barely scratched the surface of. The idea of a world that is an ever changing dungeon is a pleasing idea to me. Especially the idea of you being some combination of fighter and miner. Digdug would crap himself trying to get through some of the monsters in this game.\n\nThe combat is a sort of top-down dungeon crawler. If you've ever played Alien Swam, it should be familiar. The interesting thing is the weapon choices. While you have to have a shield, you can choose to fill your two weapon slots with swords, pistols and bombs. Swords are the middle ground, offering a decent amount of damage but you need to be right up close to the baddies. Bombs take the longest to get up but offer the ability to drop and then run, keeping you out of the way of damage. Pistols are weaker but they allow for far more range with your attacks, keeping distance between you and your target. On top of that, each weapon has a special damage type that could either cause more or less damage depending on enemy weakenesses and resistances.\n\nWhile I don't consider myu self that great at it, the combat is pretty simple but fun in this random weirdos opinion.\nAnd then there's the Battle Sprites. These are virtual pets that offer extra attacks and abilities as they grow up like an omnipresent Pokemon. They don't break the game but they are useful with currently three types: damage, poison and healing. They don't get in the way and can actually be ignored if you want, which is fine by me but I like that the Battle Sprites give you boons to attacks or defence as they grow on top of boosting their own attacks.\n\nNow, it sounds great right?\n\nThe issue is how Three Rings pays for all this...The Energy system demands money from you or you will go insane. Energy is an extra currency that works over the top of Crowns (Spiral Knight's money). Energy buys extra lives when you die, upgrades, various special weapons and more. Also, it's never really given to you for free. You either pay for it in Crowns, which is found within the game by simply playing, or with hard cash.\n\nOther free to play games are happy for you to just chip in a few coins their way occationally if you feel like it.\n\nSpiral Knights demands that you throw them cash in order to get the best equipment possible without grinding for half an eon to get enough Crowns. At lower levels of the game, this is harsh grinding if you don't have the cash to pay for Energy. To add to the issue, the levels are not that varied. They're not bad, they just repeat a lot. So, in order to get that cash, you have to run through the game over and over and over and over. If your gear isn't good enough, you'll die over and over, losing any heat (Experience, used for upgrading weapons) you've earned. You'll keep your Crowns but it's still no fun to be crushed into the dirt over and over just for some game essencials.\n\nTo add to this, the game demands that you have a certain level in all of your equipment before going forwards. Yes, this shows that the game's difficulty is about to spike upwards and you'll need the ugrade across the board but the issues with grinding come to slap you right across the face. If you don't grind though the same 10 or 20 levels, you cannot continue.\n\nI cannot recomend this for casual or general players. It's enjoyable but I can imagine a lot of players just giving up at the first equipment check point. I would recomend giving it a go to see how else to make an MMO but I can't say that the Business Model for this game is the best compared to it's competitors. If your not afraid of some awful grinding, you can find some enjoyable gameplay here.\n\nOh! Three Rings? Make a Single Player game based on this! It would be awesome! I want to see more of this world.","May 20, 2014","false","135.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","4"

For maybe 3 or 4 hours. Back when it started it was much simpler, though had a lot of pay to play in it. only doing 10 levels a day for free wasn't enough to accomplish anything substantial. But when you start you think it's all good and fun. But after you get to say 3 star gear, you start to notice the game has nothing else. You basically did everything that is in the game. After that its just rinse and repeats, and an endless grind fest of doing the exact same thing over and over again. The only thing different after that is the boss battles. And even those add an amount of new content to the game that only lasts about 5 seconds. Once you beat Vanaduke all thats left is collecting costumes and accessories and playing a dress up game. And as a final note, the Dev team is absolutely god awful. By far one of the all time worst support teams I have ever seen in my entire life. They basically arent even a support team, they're just there to make you think you will get support only to tell you days or even weeks later that what you did is something they wont help you with, and basically give you the finger and say live with the mistake you made.\n-A once former player, who saw the horror of how terribly flawed this game is far too late.","May 23, 2014","false","844.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

For maybe 3 or 4 hours. Back when it started it was much simpler, though had a lot of pay to play in it. only doing 10 levels a day for free wasn't enough to accomplish anything substantial. But when you start you think it's all good and fun. But after you get to say 3 star gear, you start to notice the game has nothing else. You basically did everything that is in the game. After that its just rinse and repeats, and an endless grind fest of doing the exact same thing over and over again. The only thing different after that is the boss battles. And even those add an amount of new content to the game that only lasts about 5 seconds. Once you beat Vanaduke all thats left is collecting costumes and accessories and playing a dress up game. And as a final note, the Dev team is absolutely god awful. By far one of the all time worst support teams I have ever seen in my entire life. They basically arent even a support team, they're just there to make you think you will get support only to tell you days or even weeks later that what you did is something they wont help you with, and basically give you the finger and say live with the mistake you made.\n-A once former player, who saw the horror of how terribly flawed this game is far too late.","May 23, 2014","false","844.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asyphyx/recommended/99900/","Asyphyx","Bast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asyphyx/","114 products in account","Spiral Knights is a MMO that plays like Diablo on fast forward. But this hack-and-slash RPG action is tempered by a spiteful pricing system that seems determined to stop you playing just as you’re starting to have fun.\nThe story of this game is that members of the Spiral Knights stranded on an alien planet, it’s our mission to hunt for the materials needed to get the Order’s spacecraft up and running so we can return home. That means fighting through The Clockworks: a series of layered dungeons leading to the core of the planet.\nThe Clockworks are vast, and full of monsters that vary according to the theme of each level. Forest areas contain wolvers and other wild creatures, while electric zones will have more robotic foes. Of course levels can have combined family mosters and statuses. Each level is full of spike traps, turrets and "danger rooms"\nEach Knight can carry two weapons at a time (you can buy extra weapon slots at the NPC market in exchange for energy), melee or ranged, and switch between them at will. Controlling your knight couldn’t be easier. A quick click will swipe or fire your weapon, you can hold down the button for a charged attack or press X to trow up a shield who will protect you for any damage on any side, but the shield can break and it has to recharge and you have to wait some time. From the safe city of Haven, you can form a party of up to four knights, dive into a clockworks and immediately start your hunt for items. Every reward feeds back into the complex levelling system.\nProgression in Spiral Knights is all about crafting. The level of your armour determines the depth you are allowed to reach. Higher tier weapons can be bought at massive prices, but it’s much more sensible to make them. If you don't have the materials you need you have to go the to NPC who trades tokens for materials.\nIn the past In Spiral Knights, everyday actions such as pressing a button on an elevator, crafting new items and reviving your knight all cost you energy but this has changed and now every player doesn't need to wait 24 hours for energy to regenerate or buy more of it.\nSpiral Knights is fast, accessible and fun until the spiteful pricing system pops up to punch you in the face.","November 2, 2013","true","661.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/carbonjinxmesa/recommended/99900/","carbonjinxmesa","CarbonMonoxide","http://steamcommunity.com/id/carbonjinxmesa/","7 products in account","Overall, I love this game.  I have been playing since March 2012, with more than 2k hours, but I did not start off on Steam, so you can't see that.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are amazing, that's all I really have to say.  They are very smooth and refined, unless you have low graphics or graphics glitches, which I don't.  Both on the knights and on the monsters, there is detail, but not so much to make them realistic, which I think would ruin the game.\n\nAdvancing:\nIt's an MMO, be prepared to grind.  I have completed the game (mostly) so I don't have to worry about grinding, but there is a massive grindwall.  For the most part, I got over this grindwall F2P, which is possible, but it is hard.  If you want to get over this grindwall, I suggest grinding with friends.  If you don't have any friends, go make some!  This game has an awesome community!  As long as you're not a beggar...\n\nWeaponry:\nI will be rather blunt here.  Some of the weaponry is extremely unrealistic, and some of it is waaay too OP.  The Dark Retribution (the DLC bomb) is rediculously powerful.  It can cause massive damage in a matter of seconds, redering everything else obsolete, depending on what you are fighting.\n\nThe rapiers in the game (flourishes and Snarby swords) are the only swords of their damage type, leaving you no other options, unfortunately.  Personally, I love them, but if you don't, you're out of luck.\n\nThe guns in the game are fairly well balanced, but, as with everything, some are better than others.  Recently, the Magnus/Tundrus line has become OP, but before they were useless.  Pulsar lines are not as powerful as before, but they are still a good choice of weaponry.  The Antigua lines are situational: you don't want to use them against just anything.\n\nLastly, some of the weaponry is just terrible for everything, even though they look powerful.\n\nPvP:\nP2W. P2W. P2W.  PvP is based on unique variants that you have to spend a lot of money to get.  You also have to have the right armor, some of which is hard to acquire.  The weapons are NOT balanced.  Rocket Hammers, rapiers, Pulsars, Sealed Sword lines, and Brandishes are all OP, but some other things that are great on monsters, such as the Blitz Needle, are terrible.\n\nCommunity:\nThe community is very small, which is an advantage.  A lot of the players are older, mature people.  If anyone acts like a ♥♥♥♥, EVERYONE soon knows it, and they can be shunned.  The P2W Lockdown players (PvP) can be those ♥♥♥♥♥, but, knowing some of them myself, not all of them are that bad.  One problem with the general community is the noobs that don't know how to grind.  They sit there begging for money in Haven (the safe zone).  Personally, I hate it.\n\nGuilds are an amazing part of the game, which boost the community.  Guilds are groups of players, and your guild is sort of like an entension of your friends list.  You can do guild versus guild Lockdown, which can be very enjoyable, unless you are a small guild person like me.  Unfortunately, the guilds with the richer players have more members.  Wealth attracts people.\n\nConclusion:\nAlthough I have found many faults in this game, it is my favorite game.  This game has ruined my life.  If you are a player of MMOs, you would enjoy this game greatly.  I think I'll give this game a 9.5/10.","February 21, 2015","true","426.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

And while I frequently reminice of my days of old when the game was still fresh and new to me, I today am only disilusioned and disenfranchized to it all. I'll start by getting the good out of the way.\n\nAs I said the gameplay is reminicent of earlier zeldas. There are a variety of damage and armor types as well as different enemy factions with strengths and weaknesses in acordance to these types. The enemy types are nicely varied and require different tactics to them. There are swords, guns, and bombs to use and equip. The arcade is essentially a sandbox element where you trek through different randomized levels. And there is good fun to be had when you take your first steps into Cradle.\n\nThen you hit it, the massive brick wall called "end game". A herculian task of overcoming frustrating RNG and tedium to get the 2nd highest level armor, then tripled that for the highest quality. Now that might not sound so bad, I mean reallly good gear should be worked for right? Well the thing is that its required to progress through the game. It's not fancy gear you can choose to get, you must get a full set of certian quality gear in order to progress through the story as there are missions that quite literally only serve as a gear check. And then you see the energy bar in the bottom corner taunting you to spend some cash to make the pain stop.\n\nAfter smashing your head against said brick wall for hours on end, or simply paying to make the pain stop, you are introduced into an end game world of freakishly overpriced fashion items and RNG prize boxes. This is a game where the endgame is cosmetic items, but due to the abhorent RNG and rarity of these items, they cost upwards of 20$-100$+ of real money. You can spend in game currency to buy premium currency (energy) which is whats often used for trading of these accessories, good luck getting anywhere if you dont plan to grind one single level and one single boss for all eternity. So unless you have enough money to smash your way into this impenetrable market, the accessory trade is strictly for veterans and no one else.\n\nBy the time you have the end game gear, you have already done most of everything this game has to offer. That deceptive climb to the top was just padding. All but the shadow lairs which are the games only end game content that a regular player would probably enjoy. But those have an up front cost of 1800 (~20$) energy just to get a key to play one. And these lairs are just altered versions of already existing boss levels.\n\nThe plot of the game is "intrigue" and thats it. You crash land on a random planet made of clockwork and machinery. Your goal is to get to the center of the planet, open up its core, and use its energy to get your space ship up and running again. Except years later, nothing has happened. Presumably all the knights were content opening prize boxes and killing giant jelly cubes to give any ♥♥♥♥♥ towards finding a way home. The plot doesnt move. At all. The core is just one giant carrot on a stick maguffin used to justify you even playing the game. The planet itself barely gets any expanded lore and when it does, its just there to justify new grindy content.\n\nSpeaking of which, most if not all the content that gets added is a massive ♥♥♥♥ing chore after the first couple of playthroughs. But if you want the new weapon or armor that gets added with it, you will be redoing it nearly hundereds of times. When you dont get blessed with grind feasts, you get prize boxes attached to microtransactions so if you want the new fancy accesories, you gota pay up one way or another.\n\nPvP? Unless you plan on spending millions of crowns (in game currency) just for stat buffs on each of your weapons, then  you will be at a huge disadvantage.\n\nWhat I loved about this game is still very much there. The gameplay, the art style, the aesthetic, just the general feel. It's all there. But it could have been so, so much more. It could have progressed in really unique and interesting ways, it could have added meaningful content to the game to keep it fresh. But for now at least, OOO seem content to slapdashing prize boxes every so often to cash in while holding grindy content updates hostage despite being ready months ago.\n\nThere is enjoyment to be had in the first moments of the game, but once you hit that wall, its pretty much that from there on.

It starts out fun but soon becomes sadistic. The developers seem to have attempted to create an A-RPG that sticks out from others. Upon doing so though, they left out some important qaulities, whilst also ruining the ones they kept. The game is very unrewarding and requires more grinding than even the most hardcore of MMO's. I suspect they thought by doing so, it would encourage more microtransactions. Clearly that's not the case judging by the low player base. The game had a lot of potential but ultimately becomes a repetative chore early on. 55/100","September 27, 2014","false","40.7"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

You go through dungeons, level up your gear and rank up into harder areas, allowing for better gear. But it soon becomes apparent that there is a massive paywall to advance. Although it can be avoided, this leads to IMMEASUREABLE amounts of grinding the same either bosses or Arcade levels constantly to either get enough of the currency, find any orbs required to ccraft new gear to advance to the higher ranks and finding the ridiculous amount of crystals needed to level up your current gear 10 times so you can buy new gear... and the droprates of all of these things is so low you can go through 10s of hours without actually having found a single one.\nAnother turnoff is that unless you already have them, there are 5 now impossible to get achiements, meaning you can't begin this game and aim to get 100%.\nThe final downfall of this game though... is there is pretty much no endgame content at all, which hasn't changed for years, and very likely won't change any time soon, or possibly even at all, so once finished it may just seem really pointless trying to continue.\nIn all seriousness, this game... if you like this sort of genre and you are going in with some friends, or you are great at making online friends, this game can be a lot of fun regardless of the insane grinding as the community is actually very nice for the most part.\nAlthough it has a  redeeming feature of its friendly casual atmosphere;  it can get insanely boring and painful to even bother,\n...so I can't recommend this game.\nShould you play Spiral Knights...? It's up to you... either try it out for yourself, or just leave it, If it doesn't look very good to you, you will not like it.","September 26, 2014","false","172.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Enemies are pretty cute too, Wolvers and Gremlins being personal favorites of mine.\n9/10\n\nSoundtrack:\nBubbly and very new age meets soft electronic, giving this game its signature sci-fi meets cute feel.\n9/10\n\nReplay rate:\nDue to the fact that its an ever changing world, has a fun & complex crafting system, many cosmetic & weaponry options, expansive mission based modes & great a for farming arcade mode. Yeah...High Replay rate.\n10/10\n\nNeed for cash (Pay to play?/Pay to win?):\nNow I won't sit here and tell you that you don't HAVE to have money to play this game to it's fullest potential, but its always a cool thing to spend a little bit extra to have that one thing you've been NEEDING to finish a cool high powered set. And sometimes, an open wallet helps.\n7/10\n\nOVERALL!\n9/10\n\nYou can play this damn game for free or not!

Guns can pack devastating status effects, fire several shots at once, and take enemies out at a distance (though with the way rooms are designed, pure gunning can be hard, but satisfying).\n\nSwords are just that, swords, they are the melee weapon of the game, some are your basic BFS (big fat sword), others are speed slicers, and others are status weapons for specific areas. The only downside to using a sword is that you have to usually be in the thick of the enemies to do the damage needed, and can put you at a disadvantage at times when needing to flip a switch, though the game itself provides jars to throw at the switches usually in case you pure-sword.\n\nBombs are my personal favorite, while pure bombers are rare, they can be devastating when they are fully upgraded. Bombs come in a few different types, combat controlling, status inflicting, damage dealing, and shard. Combat controlling usually are the gravity bombs, which pull all enemies into the same spot for a bit before exploding, great for rooms with large amounts of monsters. Status inflicting bombs don't do a lot of damage, but the effect they do can greatly ease a fight, especially the frost bomb that freezes ALL enemies in their tracks. Damage bombs are just that, they focus on pure damage, they usually have quite a bit of knockback and are great for packed rooms. Shard bombs are multiple explosion bombs that come in a few different types that I won't go super in depth for. The downside of the bomb is that while other weapons have a basic attack and a charge, bombs only charge, so bombs can take an incredibly long time to charge without any perks, and you are vulnerable while charging.\n\nA great game overall, and its randomized floor system means you hardly ever do the same run twice.","March 20, 2014","true","240.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've played this game for 4 years now, I've never put this kind of committment into a game until Spiral Knights.  I was in 8th grade and found this gem when browsing Steam.  Let's start here.\n\nMy download speeds were horrid (and still are), every game I downloaded was a committment.  I was immediately graced with this bright, cheerful music.  The title page loaded in, and I signed in through Steam (can't forget my first login), and I began my trek.  I designed this cute little knight, or so I thought.  I gave him a nice dark blue color, and unknowingly selected the fancy color pallet, which sort of disgusts me now.  I had three options; Helment(3), Armor(3), and Color(not counting).  He was my little hero, and I fell in love with the aesthetics of the crash site.  I again was immursed with the soundtrack, and loved the bright and colorful environment.  It felt open, I was free.  Free to do what?  Hell if I knew, but this felt so good.\n\nThat was 2011.\n\nI can't help but wonder what went so wrong with this little gem.  All I see now are costumes and reasons to invest realworld money in the game.  I want those days back.  That's our society, isn't it?  The constant wanting of our innocence, but nobody can grant these things.\n\nI was around 400 hours in and it was 2012.  I miss these days, Crimsonhammer was just released.  People complained of how OP the new weapons were.  Me?  Oh, I couldn't have cared less of which weapon was the best, I had my jolly little brigade, and we would delve into T2 of the clockworks, using the last of our Mist Energy on a single revive, as the living would desperately sprint from body to body, awakening our corpses to fight again.\n\nThis is not to say I didn't care of Crimsonhammer, but I had my little brigade, and I was content.  The grind was beautiful, and I could play this game forever, fighting my favorite boss, Roarmulus.  I never understood why nobody seemed to like these two.  In my messed up head, they were so beautiful.  I couldn't help but grind them, not because I had built solid Elemental Damage, but because my Fireburst Brandish had an itching for cogs that I was too eager to fulfill.\n\nI specifically remember a conversation at the end of the T2 clockworks with some knight who had been a tremendous joy to delve with.  We would go back and forth for what must have been half an hour, discussing our experiences and dissapointments with Spiral Knight's blatant abandonment of F2P players (Crimsonhammer) (I was still F2P).\n\nI really don't want to continue, the more I type, the more I remember.  My point is that this game holds tremendous sentimental value, but nothing I can say will ever change its longevity.\n\nThat little brigade and I went our seperate ways.  I only have contact with one, and he and I have become more distant with each passing week; I guess it really hurts that I never said goodbye to any of them.  I just dissapeared and my young mind was attracted to newer and better? games.\n\nThis has been something looming over my head for around 2 years now, and I couldn't imagine a better time to look back and remember the past.  This is the season to be thankful.\n\n\nYou know, with  Black Friday    ...err Turkey Day on the horizon.","November 23, 2015","true","105.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The community is incredibly nice and supportive (hello, Dota 2?) and the possibilities to play with others are endless.\n\nOne of the best things about this game is that even if you replay a mission over and over again, the scenario and map you are put into is never the same. There's an infinite number of possible map layouts for every mission, and the missions always have something different that makes that certain mission special and unique.\n\nAnother major plus is that it requires no grinding/farming to achieve the highest level, and even once you have the best gear and have completed all of the regular missions, there's still so much you can do. There's room to have up to three games on one account so you can always start anew, and if you really think you've accomplished everything there is to accomplish on one game, you can always delete it and start again, opening up another new world of possibilities and game-changing decisions to experiment with.\n\nBeing a Youtuber (PeaceOfMined), the guild and party options are incredibly useful and fun to record on, especially with the voice-sync (although it is kind of slow). The armor and sword combinations are endless, and with the battle sprites and all the different skills and compositions in one party comes a feeling that you're playing the perfect blend of Spiral Knights and League of Legends, where you have all the abilities and attack possibilities of League, and along with it have the intuitive control system, open-world feeling, and extra attacking options of Spiral Knights, as well as the manual team composition and chatting system.\n\nOne last thing is the addictiveness of the game itself. I'm a full time student as well as a musician, Youtuber and athlete. What you may notice is I seem to have more hours on record than would seem possible with a schedule like that. I agree. Spiral Knights is a very addicting game. If you have a steady job, be prepared to leave Spiral Knights for a week, as you won't like it one bit.\n\nMe: Mom can I take a short break from my homework\nMom: Sure you've been at it for three hours\nMe: *opens Spiral Knights*\nMom: (seven hours later) Are you done your homework yet?

I can't stress enough how filled with charm the visuals are.\nI love the inflection to the sound design too, but that's a weird thing to say. The majestic music and the way sound effects sound when navigating the UI / attacking / picking up items or whatever. It is just, satisfying and comfy??\nThe art and sound team did such a stellar job, I hope they're doing big things somewhere nowadays.\nGive her a listen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8exyC9_EnP4\n\nNow, the game itself?

And that is a bitter pill to swallow. There's nothing worse in my mind than wasted potential, and this game had its A-game set up for everything besides longevity.\n\nThis is a free to play MMO first and foremost, focussed on teamwork and equipment progression.

I couldn't help but grind them, not because I had built solid Elemental Damage, but because my Fireburst Brandish had an itching for cogs that I was too eager to fulfill.\n\nI specifically remember a conversation at the end of the T2 clockworks with some knight who had been a tremendous joy to delve with.  We would go back and forth for what must have been half an hour, discussing our experiences and dissapointments with Spiral Knight's blatant abandonment of F2P players (Crimsonhammer) (I was still F2P).\n\nI really don't want to continue, the more I type, the more I remember.  My point is that this game holds tremendous sentimental value, but nothing I can say will ever change its longevity.\n\nThat little brigade and I went our seperate ways.  I only have contact with one, and he and I have become more distant with each passing week; I guess it really hurts that I never said goodbye to any of them.  I just dissapeared and my young mind was attracted to newer and better? games.\n\nThis has been something looming over my head for around 2 years now, and I couldn't imagine a better time to look back and remember the past.  This is the season to be thankful.\n\n\nYou know, with  Black Friday    ...err Turkey Day on the horizon.","November 23, 2015","true","105.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The community is incredibly nice and supportive (hello, Dota 2?) and the possibilities to play with others are endless.\n\nOne of the best things about this game is that even if you replay a mission over and over again, the scenario and map you are put into is never the same. There's an infinite number of possible map layouts for every mission, and the missions always have something different that makes that certain mission special and unique.\n\nAnother major plus is that it requires no grinding/farming to achieve the highest level, and even once you have the best gear and have completed all of the regular missions, there's still so much you can do. There's room to have up to three games on one account so you can always start anew, and if you really think you've accomplished everything there is to accomplish on one game, you can always delete it and start again, opening up another new world of possibilities and game-changing decisions to experiment with.\n\nBeing a Youtuber (PeaceOfMined), the guild and party options are incredibly useful and fun to record on, especially with the voice-sync (although it is kind of slow). The armor and sword combinations are endless, and with the battle sprites and all the different skills and compositions in one party comes a feeling that you're playing the perfect blend of Spiral Knights and League of Legends, where you have all the abilities and attack possibilities of League, and along with it have the intuitive control system, open-world feeling, and extra attacking options of Spiral Knights, as well as the manual team composition and chatting system.\n\nOne last thing is the addictiveness of the game itself. I'm a full time student as well as a musician, Youtuber and athlete. What you may notice is I seem to have more hours on record than would seem possible with a schedule like that. I agree. Spiral Knights is a very addicting game. If you have a steady job, be prepared to leave Spiral Knights for a week, as you won't like it one bit.\n\nMe: Mom can I take a short break from my homework\nMom: Sure you've been at it for three hours\nMe: *opens Spiral Knights*\nMom: (seven hours later) Are you done your homework yet? It's past midnight\nMe: Yeah just a second\nMe: *the next morning* Hey mr. teacher I couldn't finish my homework last night\nTeacher: Why\nMe: I was training\nTeacher: You were playing Spiral Knights\nMe: How can you tell\nTeacher: Im secretly your friend on steam and i was in your party for five hours straight\nMe: subscribe to my channel\nTeacher: Already done\nMe: Jesus christ what have you been doing with your life\nTeacher: Spiral Knights ;D\n\nI challenge you to find a better PC open-world dungeon crawler, paid or not.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BeachEpisode/recommended/99900/","BeachEpisode","Beach Episode","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BeachEpisode/","439 products in account","This game has in my mind one of the best artstyles out of any game on Steam\nI adore it, just so gorgeous. That beautiful mix of low-poly models and crisp, contrasting colours that you only ever see when you emulate a DS game in HD or something. The environments, equipment, robots and creatures feel varied and incentivised my exploration with the intent of finding yet more for my eyes to gorge on. I can't stress enough how filled with charm the visuals are.\nI love the inflection to the sound design too, but that's a weird thing to say. The majestic music and the way sound effects sound when navigating the UI / attacking / picking up items or whatever. It is just, satisfying and comfy??\nThe art and sound team did such a stellar job, I hope they're doing big things somewhere nowadays.\nGive her a listen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8exyC9_EnP4\n\nNow, the game itself? It hasn't been updated with any real content in a long, long time. The cash store has the game by a chokehold and there is almost no way to play the game without spending money to alleviate crazy grind. The servers are becoming barren and the game is becoming less and less well optimised as time goes on. (Not to mention some really naff gameplay changes here and there for the worse)\n\nIt isn't necessarily that the gameplay is bad, it's just that the game is absolutely dead. And that is a bitter pill to swallow. There's nothing worse in my mind than wasted potential, and this game had its A-game set up for everything besides longevity.\n\nThis is a free to play MMO first and foremost, focussed on teamwork and equipment progression. By that nature, you'll need to grab some friends to help you power through the content, because you're not getting through it on your own or cheaply.\n\nCute robots are my weakness and for that reason I'm giving the game a 10/10","January 2","true","20.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/podeistaken/recommended/99900/","podeistaken","ポッド","http://steamcommunity.com/id/podeistaken/","146 products in account","I'm still surprised I'm on the verge of sinking 200 hours into what must be nothing more than "the game that places the spiral sallet helmet into your TF2 backpack." Spiral Knights is one of the most enjoyable "MMO" experiences I've ever had. I have a list of complaints about this game- the biggest being that Three Rings has been alienating the guild feature for so long with a small roster of recolored furniture and not even a ♥♥♥♥ing bulletin board to communicate a single message outside of the guild announcement. Also the fact that the game, despite appearing in our Steam inventories, somehow does not boast the ability to place a ♥♥♥♥ing single item in our Steam showcase (for a game that relies heavily on cosmetics, this is unacceptable).\nBut I'm going to give you the most unbiased, quickest review I can give this game. I can absolutely see why people don't enjoy it, but the idea of a top-down "Zelda" (although it would help to have more puzzles and hazards) MMO is so appealing to me, I can't resist. The crafting system is fair and allows for a lot of replay value in the fact that you are pretty much never done "needing" equipment (or costumes, for pea♥♥♥♥♥). Not sure how I feel about the fact that an alternate currency, "crystal energy," can be bought for such a significant amount of crowns and a low amount of cash. I love having a guild, decorating it, and inviting users to enjoy the game alongside us- even though the guild feature is seriously lacking in some departments and the people at Three Rings need to take a ♥♥♥♥ing clue but I'm willing to forego this for the sake of bringing you what you need to know. The game updates once a month (sometimes twice), and these are actually pretty significant updates by the way (they tend to bring back "events" here and there for the users to enjoy). The music is alright, not a huge hangup of mine. Gameplay might seem redundant to some people, but there are lots of ways to keep it fresh (I recommend playing with your friends or randoms at all times in order to do this), but a little detour by yourself doesn't hurt.\nI haven't dabbled in the arena or anything like that very much it all (it really doesn't interest me at the moment). From what I can tell, a lot of the lategame is spent doing old missions or playing the arcade mode in order to secure crowns and crafting "orbs" which appear randomly in the dungeon chests- and allow you to upgrade your equipment. If you're going to play this game, you need to look at the wiki at some point and decide your armor early. Despite the fact that the game draws a lot of attention to the wiki, I believe there should be some kind of projection ingame that tells you what you need to expect pursuing each armor path (but the hall of heroes does help (they don't neglect this idea as much as I spin my yarn)).\nI see a lot of enjoyment in this game and I believe there is a lot of potential as well. If you're on my friend's list or see me booting it up at any point, I encourage you to do the same. Three Rings manages to still pay attention to their fans- despite what you may think for a game of this background-prestige, and, from what I've seen, create polls to decide on what changes should be made in the longterm. A big reason I play this game is because of the aesthetic of it- it's a very cute game. Reminds me of circa 80s RPGs like Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest in the fact that you play as tiny armored creatures of some kind. Give the game a chance, though. If you see this, hit me up: my username is Pode (same as here), and I'm the guild master of "The Trojan Express."","May 29, 2014","true","174.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

This game might have a cute and coloful look but what makes it a true gem is that it requires skill to master and plenty to keep the challange going while the COOP aspect adds infinite replayability.\n\nThis is a true action game with one of the best combat systems I've come across. It feels balanced with enough variety to keep it interesting and engaging, but with enough simplicity to keep it from being unnecessarly bloated like many other games with weapon/armor upgrades end up feeling. Every enemy is fought differently and certain weapons work best against them. With all the different specialization routes like buffing up on armor, gunning, bombing, slow swords, fast swords, knockback techniques, precise shielding and dozens of different enemies on screen, it is truly rewarding to master.\n\nAlthough this game can be played exclusivly solo, the thing that really makes this game never-ending is the COOP. Technically it is a MMO but parties are limited to 4 players that must work together with different strategies to complete levels.\n\nLike any other game, it does have shortcomings, most notably the steep learning curve pertaning to making and using the variety of gear that is available, However, if you enjoy challanging action games with plenty of upgrading and COOP, you should absolutely must give this a try.","January 10, 2014","true","549.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's casual so everyone can enjoy it, but offers a sense of progression. It's an absolute blast if you have friends to play with. If you like the idea of a 4-player Legend of Zelda, give this game a shot. It's truly free-to-play now, and you don't need to spend money to progress. PvP can be insanely fun but does require a big time investment. The game mechanics are very simple but offer a lot of room for skill growth (reactions, etc.)\n\nThat said, I've played this game since it came out on beta in early 2010 and there have been zero progression updates to the game ever since SEGA acquired them in late 2011. The same final boss that appeared in 2010 is still the same final boss in 2014. The "final gate" that was locked to players in 2010 is still locked. The "hardcore" content is simply recycled dungeons and locked behind a bad paywall, but luckily you never have to touch it. The game has basically devolved into a cycle of minor updates with no progression content, and a bunch of cosmetic items. Hats. And more hats.\n\nThe fact that it's coded in Java is also a huge problem, as there are some fundamental issues with the code that make the game poorly optimized. The biggest problem is Java having to dump its memory every time it reaches the memory cap, causing the game to occasionally stutter as Java does this, even on beast computers. See these threads:\n\n1. http://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/12849\n2. http://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/2188\n\nI recommend this game especially if you have friends to play with. It'll offer a solid hundred hours of enjoyable, challenging fun. But if/when you get to the end, don't expect them to add any more progression content... because they won't, and haven't since 2010.","December 10, 2014","true","44.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Everything is cute, so in contrast to other hack-n-slash games this is great if you're a squeamish person. I, personally am not and I prefer to have my enemies twitching with blood gushing out is a reward by itself. Combat is a bit slow, but incredibly fun, especially with a party because the game attempts to swarm you with enemies, and it's cool to personally smack each and every one of them with your sword, bomb or gun.\n\nThe thing that got on my nerves the most in this game are overspecialization of weapons. Each enemy does different types of damage, Elemental, Piercing, and shadow, and you can find yourself screwed if you show up to a level full of shadow damage dealing enemies with elemental Armour, and you're much more vulnerable. The weapon damage system is similar, enemies can either be very good at resisting a damage type or very weak to it; making weapons tremendously more situational and will cause you to grind more just so you can be the jack of all trades. The game as it is now has basically turned into Team Fortess 2 in the dress-up aspect except the game's content and enjoyment comes to a stop in a certain point because the development team doesn't feel like making actual new content and resorts to making Spiral Knights endgame a big dress up.\n\nA good multiplayer hack-n-slash that's being held back by major flaws.","January 20, 2014","false","623.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

This game might have a cute and coloful look but what makes it a true gem is that it requires skill to master and plenty to keep the challange going while the COOP aspect adds infinite replayability.\n\nThis is a true action game with one of the best combat systems I've come across. It feels balanced with enough variety to keep it interesting and engaging, but with enough simplicity to keep it from being unnecessarly bloated like many other games with weapon/armor upgrades end up feeling. Every enemy is fought differently and certain weapons work best against them. With all the different specialization routes like buffing up on armor, gunning, bombing, slow swords, fast swords, knockback techniques, precise shielding and dozens of different enemies on screen, it is truly rewarding to master.\n\nAlthough this game can be played exclusivly solo, the thing that really makes this game never-ending is the COOP. Technically it is a MMO but parties are limited to 4 players that must work together with different strategies to complete levels.\n\nLike any other game, it does have shortcomings, most notably the steep learning curve pertaning to making and using the variety of gear that is available, However, if you enjoy challanging action games with plenty of upgrading and COOP, you should absolutely must give this a try.","January 10, 2014","true","549.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Spiral Knights is one of the most enjoyable "MMO" experiences I've ever had. I have a list of complaints about this game- the biggest being that Three Rings has been alienating the guild feature for so long with a small roster of recolored furniture and not even a ♥♥♥♥ing bulletin board to communicate a single message outside of the guild announcement. Also the fact that the game, despite appearing in our Steam inventories, somehow does not boast the ability to place a ♥♥♥♥ing single item in our Steam showcase (for a game that relies heavily on cosmetics, this is unacceptable).\nBut I'm going to give you the most unbiased, quickest review I can give this game. I can absolutely see why people don't enjoy it, but the idea of a top-down "Zelda" (although it would help to have more puzzles and hazards) MMO is so appealing to me, I can't resist. The crafting system is fair and allows for a lot of replay value in the fact that you are pretty much never done "needing" equipment (or costumes, for pea♥♥♥♥♥). Not sure how I feel about the fact that an alternate currency, "crystal energy," can be bought for such a significant amount of crowns and a low amount of cash. I love having a guild, decorating it, and inviting users to enjoy the game alongside us- even though the guild feature is seriously lacking in some departments and the people at Three Rings need to take a ♥♥♥♥ing clue but I'm willing to forego this for the sake of bringing you what you need to know. The game updates once a month (sometimes twice), and these are actually pretty significant updates by the way (they tend to bring back "events" here and there for the users to enjoy). The music is alright, not a huge hangup of mine. Gameplay might seem redundant to some people, but there are lots of ways to keep it fresh (I recommend playing with your friends or randoms at all times in order to do this), but a little detour by yourself doesn't hurt.\nI haven't dabbled in the arena or anything like that very much it all (it really doesn't interest me at the moment). From what I can tell, a lot of the lategame is spent doing old missions or playing the arcade mode in order to secure crowns and crafting "orbs" which appear randomly in the dungeon chests- and allow you to upgrade your equipment. If you're going to play this game, you need to look at the wiki at some point and decide your armor early. Despite the fact that the game draws a lot of attention to the wiki, I believe there should be some kind of projection ingame that tells you what you need to expect pursuing each armor path (but the hall of heroes does help (they don't neglect this idea as much as I spin my yarn)).\nI see a lot of enjoyment in this game and I believe there is a lot of potential as well. If you're on my friend's list or see me booting it up at any point, I encourage you to do the same. Three Rings manages to still pay attention to their fans- despite what you may think for a game of this background-prestige, and, from what I've seen, create polls to decide on what changes should be made in the longterm. A big reason I play this game is because of the aesthetic of it- it's a very cute game. Reminds me of circa 80s RPGs like Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest in the fact that you play as tiny armored creatures of some kind. Give the game a chance, though. If you see this, hit me up: my username is Pode (same as here), and I'm the guild master of "The Trojan Express."","May 29, 2014","true","174.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It's casual so everyone can enjoy it, but offers a sense of progression. It's an absolute blast if you have friends to play with. If you like the idea of a 4-player Legend of Zelda, give this game a shot. It's truly free-to-play now, and you don't need to spend money to progress. PvP can be insanely fun but does require a big time investment. The game mechanics are very simple but offer a lot of room for skill growth (reactions, etc.)\n\nThat said, I've played this game since it came out on beta in early 2010 and there have been zero progression updates to the game ever since SEGA acquired them in late 2011. The same final boss that appeared in 2010 is still the same final boss in 2014. The "final gate" that was locked to players in 2010 is still locked. The "hardcore" content is simply recycled dungeons and locked behind a bad paywall, but luckily you never have to touch it. The game has basically devolved into a cycle of minor updates with no progression content, and a bunch of cosmetic items. Hats. And more hats.\n\nThe fact that it's coded in Java is also a huge problem, as there are some fundamental issues with the code that make the game poorly optimized. The biggest problem is Java having to dump its memory every time it reaches the memory cap, causing the game to occasionally stutter as Java does this, even on beast computers. See these threads:\n\n1. http://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/12849\n2. http://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/2188\n\nI recommend this game especially if you have friends to play with. It'll offer a solid hundred hours of enjoyable, challenging fun. But if/when you get to the end, don't expect them to add any more progression content... because they won't, and haven't since 2010.","December 10, 2014","true","44.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

That's pretty much where the game went down hill.\n\nEvery where you go now, it's almost empty. And as I have said before "I've made so many friends." I can no longer even talk to them since they quit the game. Each and every day, I would be excited to wake up, excited to log on and hang out with my friends I've made on here. Now, it's just me and one or two friends online (that are in the same guild that is).\n\nI hate to see the game that I've spent so many hours... So many years on just die.\n(Sorry if I didn't make sense up there. I kinda jumped around. ._.)\nBut, I will still continue to play it...","January 10, 2015","true","119.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It was even updated recently to be more playable for everyone, getting out of the game some problems that ruined most of the gameplay and more additions to what was already good. Graphics are neat, community is nice and events are often present over the seasons.\nThen why i am not recommending it?\n\nStill some issues and bugs that seems to be hard to fix are present and ruin much of the gameplay, like often very bad sync with game server-computer, the need for a good and stable internet connection to play properly, even if you want to play alone.\nSome little graphical glitches were fixed, other are still in game, but this don't really ruin the game; rather, sometimes these glitches could steal a smile.\nAnd if you can bear these problems, there is still one big trouble.\n\nPay money = you advance better in the game = you win.\n\nSome unique materials that are needed to create better weapons and gears can't be traded in any way, means you can't even buy/sell/give some of these pretty scarce materials to other players or friends. Instead, you can buy these from the shop in-game with a second currency, different than the standard one you can obtain playing the game, that requires you to pay a very big amount of the standard currency to buy this one, or you can easily get it by paying real money and getting bunches of this.\n\nEven some little kind of upgrades that randomly appears while crafting your equipment are more expensive even than the cost of the strongest weapon themselves. This considering the mostly-real money currency.\n\nAlso some unbalance between the weapons is present, since some that have the same level than others that are less popular, are infact fairly better than these: even if there is an attack type system, some weapons that haven't the standard attack type are good just for EVERY kind of monster. And let's not speak when there is the weak type of monster against these weapons.\n\nOverall the game is pretty nice, but even with my amount of hours spent i can't just recommend this game to everyone, mostly for the annoying sync system and the pay-to-win system, even if it's one of the lowest i ever seen in free to play games.","March 8, 2014","false","272.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SnowySylvia/recommended/99900/","SnowySylvia","Snowy the Glaceon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SnowySylvia/","132 products in account","To this day, Spiral Knights remains one of my favourite "go-to" casual play games in terms of adventure-style games. I think it's time I re-reviewed it.\n\nGameplay at it's core\n\nThe core aspect of any game. The gameplay type involved is a dungeon crawler, top-down view, adventure-style game. Think Legend of Zelda, in a mix of Four Swords coupled with Phantasy Star (Albeit very loosely)\n\nIt has an interesting perspective, being not overly puzzling, but challenging at places and very atmospheric when it wants to be. Every battle tends to feel slightly different from your last one in some aspect.\n\nUnfortunately, there's one flaw with all this; The game's optimization is rather subpar. As a result, lag spikes do tend to occur at a semifrequent basis. It's unfortunate, considering the game is quite stellar otherwise.\n\nGameplay-wise, the score is a 8/10.\n\nArtistic design\n\nThis game has a rather unique art style. It doesn't seem to stick to one general area, rather being more spaced out in several different directions at once.\n\nThe players themselves, the Knights, are a good example of this. You begin as a knight who can look serious or cheerful, in a dark or vivid colour, that's either blacklight or neon, accented by vibrant pastel colours or murky, metallic styles. They look like those little figurines you can get, and can come in either plush, clay, or metal materials.\n\nThe Clockworks themselves do a nice little background job, themselves. Each level seems sculpted to fit the design of the level and the family that lives within them. One family, known as Fiends, lives in an office-type scenario, with glyphs sometimes strewn about. Lighting wherever appropriate.\n\n9.5/10 with this one, only because on rare occasions, you get odd-looking pieces that don't seem to belong.\n\nMusic Composition\n\nWhoever came up with the music scores did an excellent job setting the mood for the area players are in. This is most noticible in boss levels, and tends to come to one of the most engaging boss themes I've ever heard. And this game's been released for quite a few years now.\n\n10/10 because I really don't see - well hear - any flaws with this one.\n\nStart to finish Gameplay Experience\n\nUnlike the core gameplay experience, this is how it can be, from start to finish, at a reasonable experience.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the only category where I feel it tanks at. It's nice and smooth at the start, as you typically get everything you need easily enough and can progress. When you hit about Knight or Defender level, however, that's when you start to see the reason as to why the game isn't as popular as it was or could have been.\n\nThe main issue is the energy costs associated with acquiring the gear you need to progress. When I first began playing (This was one of my first Steam games), the energy system was Mist and Crystal energy. It took 10 energy to go down a floor. This is where my gears started to grind just a tad. That basically meant that, unless you had a bottomless wallet, you couldn't really play...unless you had an elevator pass.\n\nHowever, while the new system is better, it's not by much. Yes, there's no more elevator costs, at all, but there's now Orbs of Alchemy, which is the main reason why people stopped playing.\n\nI say it's better, however, because of how easy it can be to simply get a bunch of energy, especially now. You need 3 orbs of alchemy of a certain type to progress in the game. The one minor thing with that is the people don't seem to realize it's the same costs as before, it just takes an extra step, sometimes mitigated entirely if your luck is good enough to get all 3 orbs of alchemy while you get the 200 or so Energy you need for your weapons.\n\nFurther, you need only ONE of your weapons at the star requirement (In the example above, 3 stars) to proceed, not the other one, two, or three. Overall, to get all 5-star gear, you either need to get very lucky, or cough up 3200 energy for 12 Eternal Orbs of Alchemy. Which, thanks to the drop system, is very unlikely you'll need to cough up all 3200, if even half that. Besides, some of the orbs appear as mission rewards.\n\nThat being said, it's still a grind, thanks to the heat system rework and needed Fire Crystals to get the weapons up to the levels needed to progress. That's where I say not by much in terms of how better it is, but it's still not as bad as people think. One word of warning: Go full-out or you may find yourself experiencing Final Fantasy Luck Syndrome.\n\n6.75/10. As a side note, you can get 100 energy for a set number of crowns, which you'll likely get in 1 or 2 runs of the number of floors, anyway. It's honestly easier to get crowns than you might think.\n\nOverall Enjoyment\n\nIt's a real shame this game gets the hate it doesn't deserve. In fact, I think it's fair to say this is an underrated gem. Of course, every game has it's flaws, and I pointed out perhaps some of the major ones, the two big ones being optimization and the grind to get to Vangaurd rank.\n\nHowever, this game has some very fun moments, and at no point do you feel underwhelmed when someone brings in their 5-star gear to your party of 2-star equipment. That's the beauty of it; the game is balanced so no one weapon tends to feel super-souped up over the other, rather just gets the job done a tad faster.\n\nThe only other complaint I have is that missions tend to be slow for release. But if that just means they have tweaks to them, or want to make sure everything runs smooth (See the Gunner Update), then I don't care how long I have to wait, personally.\n\nOverall score: 8/10. A definite recommendation of mine. This might not be for everyone, of course, but if you like what you see, download it and give it a go. The grind isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be, though it is intimidating at first, and when it runs, it's mostly smooth sailing from start to finish.","September 27, 2015","true","572.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I have good experiences but also a few bad ones which eventually made me quit spiral knights.\n\nI started playing together with a friend just to try it out but as we progressed i eventually came to the conclusion that it was a fun game so i got into it. During my plays i kept hitting several walls though. My first problem was the repetitive level design which started to look the same the more i played it. I dismissed that problem eventually in favor of the story line but my biggest problem was levelling the armor and weapons, the higher tier i get the harder it becomes to get the crafting materials thus more tempting it gets to purchase what items you need from the store with real money. You can't progress the storyline unless you level up your armor at least 5 times at set points in the story line.\n\nThis means you either have to grind insane amounts of levels and trade a lot of it with others in order to get the amounts of ingame currency or do it the easy attractive way and convert real currency such as dollars pounds or euros at the ingame store to energy used to buy weapons and armor at prices which eventually equals the price of a full new retail price of a game if not more. The transaction options didn't sit very well with me either, You can either pay by credit card which is pretty normal here on steam for people aged 18 and over but here's the thing. You can pay by text message as well. Just give the ingame store your cellphone number and they send you a message, You agree and they make money from the message you send. What do all the kids walk around with these days? They all have cellphones that the parents gave them and that text message transaction option will make it very tempting for underage kids to make the mistake by going overboard with their cellhpone without the parent's consult.\n\nI'm not too fond of this kind of practises. I had much fun with this game and that won't be forgotten but the more i played the more downhill it went. I abandoned it when i reached the 4 star armor cap and i'm fine with it. The only thing i will miss is the helpful community that this game has. It saved my bacon more than once.\n\nStill, don't let all this discourage you from trying it out. This game is free to play and you can download this game for yourself whenever you like and form an opinion based on your own experiences. That is something i can recommend.\n\nI hope my info has been helpful to you.\n\n\nAll the best!\n\n(s.i.e)","January 25, 2015","false","76.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","5"

It draws heavily from the top down Zeldas but throws a lot of other things into the mix, such as Bomberman. With a good progression system, lots of unique weapons, interesting pets, and simple systems, it's a plain great game. Sadly, there's little balance to be found in the game and the developers aren't quite in touch with the community. The community is pretty friggin' great, however. The devs wouild gain a lot from listening a bit more to it.\n\nThe game used to be much more pay to play but since half a year ago (summer 2013), it's truly free to play. The great majority of pay to play content comes in the form of promotions that cost Energy. Energy can be bought for real life money or the in game currency, "crowns". Thus, there's no real life money barrier between any player and pay to play content, which mostly consists of purely cosmetic items directed to end game players.\n\nAnother thing I truly like about this game is the art style. The characters are space marine knights with colourful armours and really cool weapons. There's also no sex-appeal involved. Characters don't even have anything that tells you whether they are men or women and that is probably one of the things that contribute to a community with so very little sexism.\n\nSpiral Knights is truly a beautiful piece of art so stop reading this review and go play it.","January 6, 2013","true","516.7"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GamerFail/recommended/99900/","GamerFail","DetectiveFail","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GamerFail/","201 products in account","Long ago. 3 years ago, on Aug 27, 2011. I was but a young lad. young, naive, perhaps innocent. In the new world of Spiral Knights.\n\nSpiraling down a chasm of confusion and curiosity, I was finally brought up with a recommendation to Spiral Knights. Filled with swords, pistols, shields, parties, dungeons, and list of items\n\nThe game Spiral knights(SK) from recollection memories during my first journey through it's dungeons and game-play nearly three years ago. Was enjoyable to say the least.\n\n\nIf you for one second can imagine an down graphics to appeal to the ages of 7-13 then probably this game is for you. If your into friendship and co-op through dungeons facing monsters with your trusty pistol or sword and shield, then perhaps this game is for you.\n\nHowever, I digress. S.K. proved to be something that is beyond the average you normally see. Imagine yourself a kid, after the game boy era, the ps1 era, the xbox era, and you have an era of ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes. Granted, mmo's have existed since probably before the age of 2001 with WoW at its center.\n\nThe mmo S.K. is to be honest short lived game, pulling your slightest attention for the smallest of seconds through promotions with Team Fortress 2. Such was the case for me when I ashamedly downloaded this game for another TF2 hat promo from S.K.\n\nEnjoyable in the sense, that I alone played by myself seeking for riches and glory. I didn't expect much, and that is proven by my hours spent on this game. Later on, I played with my friends together in a typical fashion of dungeon crawling and killing bosses. I'd compare SK to Torchlight, however both games are entirely different and this review isn't about a comparison.\n\nIt's about telling you my experience. As long as you have friends that back you up in this free to play game. You can literally have a good time. There is a grinding system, but only if you devote many of your efforts to getting the best equipment or the best item for you as soon as possible.\n\nThough, in my case. I tried to go for higher quality items, but found it too troublesome to do so. Instead I focused on having fun delving into dungeons with friends in co-op. Laughing so hard when we die because of a stupid mistake like getting stuck in a trap. Or perhaps giving cheers for everyone when we all completed an item set or finished a boss.\n\nIf you like playing short-to-play games for free, and having fun with friends I would definetly reccomend this game for you.\n\nAfter-all it's not often a studio would go so far to diversify itself for Triple A-A-A games in a Free-2-Play manner. Or would they?\n\n\n(Original Post, Aug 27, 2011) Old score 7.29/10\n(Re-edited Post Feb. 6, 2014) New score 7.3/10\n(Score is based off how much I enjoyed playing the game)","February 6, 2014","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aggron521/recommended/99900/","Aggron521","Aggron521","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aggron521/","","I decided to review this game because I played extensivly and I have a feeling I can write a review based on my knowledge. Anyways this is my first review so if I make some sort of mistake let it slide.\n\nSo this game is Spiral Knights, a MMORPG that has a kinda in depth story, the story goes as follows apparently you are in a ship it's attacked, its about to blow up and you and all of your shipmates land on the Clockworks where monsters and creatures live in some hostile but some friendly. Spiral Knights also has a rank system which grants you the ability to make and weild/use better equipment. They are 10 ranks each with their own quests. But a big turn-down though is that sometimes there is a Hall of Heroes quest which requires you to have _ * Equipment...All of it. This leads to grinding for materials and Orbs of Alchemy, different types. Sometimes you can get stuck in this game because of this so the only choice you got is to save up those orbs. you are gonna need at least 15 orbs of whatever type to make the armor alongside other materials. However you eventually get this creature called a Battle Sprite which can help you fight but it wont attack by itself with default attacks, in fact it doesn't have a default attack which means you are responsible for any losses you have which can be a pain if you suck. Luckily it is pretty fun in general. Leveling up your Battle Sprite so it's stronger, getting new armor, weapons and sheilds, doing a quest for the first time, finding rare items. But it all boils down to do you like MMORPG's in general.\n\nMy ending note is this, Spiral Knights can be fun (and in some casses addicting) but it is much more fun with friends and when you are part of a guild. Either way making Armor and weapons aren't that fun and grinding can really be annoying but the amount of fun I have in each quest backs it up, if anything I think the best part for me is my Battle Sprite... Since this doesn't really have a rating system (Kinda but not really) I would give it a rating of 7/10. Its fun if you like RPGs and Doing quests and MMOs so. If you like these things I reccomend it, it is free so go for it if you wanna.","August 7, 2014","true","48.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I quit the game almost early, because there was a broad storyline I could almost not follow, and the layout of the screen almost confused me at times. When I did understand what I was supposed to do, and (rarely) why, I would enjoy the heck out of myself. The graphics are still amazing for the game, but for myself ( who doesn't like when my UI is cramped) the game got boring quick. It quickly reminded me of my first days of WoW, and how I quit after a week of trying to get used to the cramped screen. Would not reccomend for anyone who is not used to the RPG feel of a cramped screen, but if you like a cramped screen, but would enjoy a more smooth and sci-fi graphical scene, this game is for you.","August 3, 2014","true","23.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

IT has caused me an unbeleavable ammount of pain. STAY AWAY!!!!\n\nIt is very much pay2win oriented, since resurrecting in the dungeons uses up energy and you only get roughly 100 per day (and each time you revive, it's cost doubles, so first it's 10, then 20 then 40, etc.).\nIt is absolutely imperative that you live a maximum of 7 feet away from their servers, otherwise you'll have to predict enemy movement before they even telegraph it. Same goes for your own actions as you'll see your own sword pass through enemies unless you time it juuuuust right.\nIf you DO decide to play this, remember: your shield is TOOL to be used often. Use it's pushing ability to scatter surrounding enemies away before they strike (again, have to time it right or you'll get hit despite having your shield up).\n\nNot recommended.","December 19, 2011","false","340.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ali_Morrisane/recommended/99900/","Ali_Morrisane","Zerofyne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ali_Morrisane/","154 products in account","Play this game.\n\nIt's a dungeon crawler MMORPG with a dash of zelda inserted for good measure. The old 'free' mist energy may have been scrapped, but so have energy costs for elevators and alchemy. In short, buying energy with real money is now a shortcut, not a necessity. It's perfectly possible to play through the entire main game (i.e. the 'rank' missions) completely free.\n\nThere are no 'character levels', but your equipment gains 'heat' (basically exp), and after a certain amount is collected, you can level it up via the forge. Weapons 'evolve' through alchemy, and new weapons can be crafted via alchemy.\n\nThe main game has you play as a knight who completes various missions which revolve around exploring what is known as the clockworks and fighting various monsters there. Rank missions involve you exploring 2-3 levels of the clockworks each time, whereas using the arcade lets you explore more freely - once you've done enough rank missions, you can go from 'depth 0' to 'depth 29' in a single run.\n\nThe levels within the clockworks get progressively harder as you go deeper, and there are four main bosses to kill (as many times as you want) - and that's not including the difficult 'shadow lairs'. I feel that there's an emphasis on teamwork throughout the game (working as a team to complete missions makes it easier and you still get the same drops) and somewhat on player skill later on (even with excellent equipment, you'll still die if you're bad with a shield).\n\nIt should be said, however, that if you don't wish to fork out any cash for energy, then you may find that the grinding required to advance throughout the game may prove too repetitive and boring - experienced MMO players probably won't suffer from this issue, however.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a great game for those who enjoy MMOs, exploration and adventure. Me gusta.","December 7, 2013","true","180.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

This game has, for some reason, been taken off my library, but I can't be bothered to care or even take a peek back inside.

The combat system is very simple and easy to use for new players. PvP and Dungeons/Missions are included in the game so you'll be able to choose what type of path to choose in the game. PvP is probably most recommend when you're done with all Missions or if you at least have experience with combat. And the game has different weapons you can have such as swords, guns and bombs. You can either choose to have one each out of the three or just focus on one type of weapon. Very fun game overall.","January 20, 2015","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While hard to find at times, it is still possible to find the required item in Prize Boxes in through the dungeon.\n\nThe newer updates the game have put the focus back on exploration and spending time in the Clockworks and learning the game at your own pace, not buying everything with real world money and just spending time in pvp.\n\nI have sunk easily 1000+ hours over the course of my time playing Spiral Knights and it will always be one of my most favorite games ever because of all of the memories I have made through the 3 years I have been playing.","February 2, 2015","true","295.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I play this game direct from the website itself (www.spiralknights.com/play), that's why it looks like I haven't played much.  This game incorporates a number of themes smoothly into a fun adventure for gamers of all types.  This is a cooperative game that allows you to make friends and help them out, has a puzzle aspect in the levels, and the arcade portion of the clockworks is a genuine different adventure every day.  As new updates come out the game gets even better.  Updates aren't too far spaced and the new content is usually great.\nIn conclusion:  This is a great game that is really free to play if one puts in the effort.  Don't take for granted the cartoony/cute graphics, this is a genuine challenge that is worthy of even advanced gamers.  Try it.  See if you like it.

Plus the bloody game is based around farming vana for friggin CR.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linkalee/recommended/99900/","linkalee","Linkalee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linkalee/","126 products in account","Ah, Spiral Knights. How can I keep this recommendation within the character limit. Well, it's a free-to-play action-based MMO, but it remains free-to-play due to a mechanic that allows only so much playtime each day. And if you get addicted, which you will, you need to at least buy a monthly pass, that's basically required to enjoy the game anyway, unless you only have an hour or two to play each day anyway, in which case this is a perfect system for you. The game starts out easy, the controls are very simple, and they recently added an optional tutorial/questing system, which makes it even easier to start playing. However, things get insanely challenging later on. Bullet hells, spike hells, fiery helly hells. There are even special areas made just to be cruel hells. Admittedly it gets easier once you become experienced and know what to expect, but there are still areas that are basically impossible to progress through solo. This game will teach you how to use a shield, I'll say that.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI'm changing this recommendation from positive to negative. This game is dying. A year ago, this was an underappreciated gem of an MMO. There was new content being regularly released for free that drew you in, and then while you were here there were cosmetics and boosts that you could pay for if you wanted to. This is how the free-to-play model should work, content that draws you in and keeps you playing while simultaneously not being locked behind a paywall and being open to anyone, whether they pay or not. And for the most part, this model still applies to new players who haven't experienced all the content yet.\n\nBut the new content updates that comprise the backbone of this model have long since died off. Promises were made and never kept, the lead developer upped and left, and a noticeably large chunk of the playerbase has died off due to boredom. It feels like a lot of drive and inspiration has been lost and Three Rings thinks it can fill this void with shiny "new" reskins and repeating event content and hope that no one notices while they try to piece everything back together behind the scenes, IF they're trying to piece everything back together behind the scenes, maybe they aren't. It's been over a year now and there are STILL a bunch of unfixed problems and bugs related to the sprites update that was released just before everything fell apart.\n\nExamples: Some minerals have no purpose and get stuck in your inventory; sprites have a level numbering system that makes no sense, the "true" max level is some number over 100 that the game doesn't tell you; the only way of knowing that you've reached this "true" max level is that your sprite glitches out and stops accepting levelup food; and there are quite a few balance issues with pet abilties and ultimates, some are even outright bugs themselves.\n\n(Seraphynx's Violent Heart Attack ultimate causes targets enchanted with Heart Attack to explode. Sounds cool, right? It does until you realize that the explosion does almost zero damage even in tier three and is really only good for breaking blocks. And the alternative ultimate, Iron Heart Attack, has a chance to drop defense orbs that maybe cushion half a pip's worth of damage, also in tier three. Take your pick between useless and more useless. In fact, just stay away from Seraphynx in general, its first ability has a deceptively large hitbox combined with a maximum hit limit per enemy that makes no sense, its second ability is very unreliable and might not even have an effect at all, and its third ability has too small of a radius to be useful in the team setting that it's meant to be useful in and has only enough health for one, maaaaaaybe two hits for everyone and not per person, it's mostly just for running over traps that you're too impatient to wait for. Hell, the other non-defense-oriented sprites have BETTER individual defensive abilities than the defense-oriented sprite, because the defense sprite is meant for providing defense for the whole team, yet the balance just isn't there to actually provide reliable and worthwhile defensive abilities for multiple people simultaneously, it's better if everyone just brought their own Flame Barrier and Shadow Cloak buffs and went from there. Unless you just like shiny cosmetic kittens, of course.)\n\nPhew.\n\nMy point is, these things are acceptable for a month or two after a big update, not a year, and the fact that so little has changed to make the game better in that time tells me that they've probably stopped caring about Spiral Knights altogether. If you're new to the game you will have all sorts of fun in everything that's been established already, but don't invest too much into your future here, at the rate things are going you won't have much of one.","February 27, 2012","false","334.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can run around the game and waste your time collecting something that you think will move your character forwars, in stead of paying money for a quick route to finishing line, which keeps on moving on. This seems old too quickly and seems like a one trick pony did it's purpose. And then you want to remove it and a bit regret the time wasted, that's not easy after all.\n\nItems that the game gives to you cannot be removed or transferred by steam account so there they stay and seem to be impossible to remove and only after reinstall of the game and removal of all in game accounts can every trace of the game removed from your steam account.\nSo remember to do that or you end up downloading it back again one day just to remove it.","June 29, 2014","false","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Tried multi-box farming and other "non-normal" way to make money before the patch that removes energy requirement on elevator. So you know I am not those casual players with less than 20 hours game time who will be shouting "omg this game is so fun so cute, play it and you will never regret".\n\nThe gameplay was fun, but grind wall hits me hard after about 20 hours of gameplay--just like almost every other free-to-play game out there.\n\nFor example, in order to do higher level content, you can:\n1. play this game everyday for an hour for 2 weeks so that you accumulates enough mats which could upgrade your gears\n2. forget about life, forget about work, grind countinously and get those gears in a single day\n3. swipe your card and purchase gears directly from the in-game auction house\n\nI quited playing seriously simply because the game was not rewarding enough based on the time I invested in this game. But I still log back in once in awhile just to listen to the music and slash some enemies.\n\nRecent patches are always cash-oriented, which, for sure, increase the grind level of this game in general.\n\nIn conclusion, Spiral Knights is a medicore F2P game. Gameplay is interesting and unique, but it requires serious grinding to get anything you want. I would recommend playing it casually--explore the world, try out new things, and log off. If you want to play this game hardcore, it will be very repetitive, frustrating, and time-consuming.","October 23, 2014","false","112.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Why not saying "Hey you can ad so and so many things to your armor or take it of as you please. But if you want to wear more than x things than you have to pay for slots" which would also result in a far better customization Menu, and would bring allot more depth into the game and still would keep that buying or earning option, just in a not so rediclues way.\n\n#2 Difficulty!\nWhile this doesn't matter to everyone the most of you it does. It is rediclues easy. Up until this point I was walking allone! Allone! In a 4 Player Coop Game! Unlike Borderlands never be meant to play Alone! In the Hardest Difficulty! And I got easily trough!

It's plain bad. VERY bad. Think as bad as Runescape and you aren't far.\n(On a side note, are all ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes programmed in Java cursed to be bad?)\nSure, you may be thinking "This is an angry rant, not a review". Well, let's see...\n\nIn the past, there was a thing called Mist Energy (Mist = Free, Crystal = In-Game or Real Money),\nup to a max of 100 at a time. If you don't play the game and didn't come across the concept in the reviews, Energy is used for the main aspects in the game. While it restricted daily playtime for free players, it encouraged cooperative gameplay, which, in turn made the community overall a nice bunch.\nNowadays, you get to play as much as you want (there was a 10 Energy fee for entering levels),\nbut everything else is slow and tedious to do. Take crafting for instance; Previously, you crafted things with Energy. It took a chunk of time, but it was pretty doable until higher levels. Today, you have to get "Crystals" to craft items.\nThey are paid with energy or found, but are:\nIf playing levels, as rare as a cold glass of soda in a desert\nIf buying with in-game currency, a 3-weeks-average grindfest to craft an item\nIf buying with real money, an "I am rich" showcase of your many 5-star items\nAnd then comes the forge system. You see, you need heat (too!) to improve your weapons, and there are up to 10 levels of heat. Previously, heat level raised automatically (ala level up when you have enough exp).\nCurrently, heat levels are increased when you provide "Embers" to a forge. The main flaws of this system are:\nThey suffer from the same problems of Crystals\nForges are only found outside missions\nTherefore, you lose many potential heat levels while searching for Embers.\n\nAnd now, *drumroll*...\n\nUPDATES!\n\nThe updates are many, but few can be actually called updates. You may be wondering what do I mean by this. Well, most updates are cosmetics which have little to no effect on gameplay. 99.99% of those are silly recolors of 5 star items or costumes, which cost either a zillon coins or $100 of your local currency. The major updates are seldom released (the most recent having been released 4 months ago), with the majority of them being missions or equipment, with gameplay changes being perjudicial (well, only making elevators free helped players).\nNot to mention that none of them added to the main storyline. That's right, folks! When the main storyline is over, you have little or nothing left to do.\n\nLet's talk about the miscellania of content here: PvP and Shadow Lairs.\n\nPvP? Craft a 5 star weapon with attack speed and damage UVs (read: modifiers), suit yourself in an armor with similar modifiers (now you know why everyone runs around in wolf costumes) and you are ready to go. Enough said.\n\nShadow Lairs? I have to admit, now that looks like something fun to do. Problem is, you need Shadow Keys to enter and a lot of Sparks of Life (used to revive) for this, both being ridiculously expensive. And, except the Shadow Key, that goes for all your fellow party members (you'll definitely want to have a full party before entering). This is the ultimate challenge in the game, but as such, it is the ultimate money sink (aside from crafting, that is).\n\nNow, if you want to play the game anyways, I won't stop you. But remember this: There are many better games out there, don't waste your time on this one unless you like seeing knights in shiny armor and impressive weapons while having a crappy semi-automatic laser pistol and that armor you managed to craft after 2 months of grinding.","September 26, 2014","false","320.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azelyra/recommended/99900/","Azelyra","Kirishima Sakura desu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azelyra/","73 products in account","Spiral Knights! A "F2P" (Free To Play) Game released by Three Rings and SEGA back in April 2010.\n\nPlot: The mystery of the story unfolds as you follow your quests down into the depths of Cradle (The planet setting) to know why the Spiral Knights have crashed down onto this mysterious planet. To get out, they will have to harness the energy from "The Core" which lies in the deepest parts of the planet, but with the mysterious machine and world called the "Clockworks" that lies below, the dangers of delving into the planet and the knight's fate will remain unknown... In this ever-changing world. As the game's main storyline is still incomplete, the developers still keeps updating the game. We are surely all thrilled to see what will unfold when "The Core" patch finally releases in the upcoming future.\n\nGameplay and Multiplayer: Spiral Knights is a very interesting co-op dungeon crawler, as it is a face paced gameplay through many diverse environments in the clockworks. As the players will be able to play together to 4 player, it is also a drop-in/drop-out multiplayer which does not affect how you play but make the hostile enemies get a little tougher. It is a top-down third-person real-time action/adventure game which could be compared to some old games for example The Legend of Zelda and so. As for this style, some hardcore gamers that play games like Diablo and so might find this very boring and a little too "old school" for what they call "games" nowadays.\n\nVisuals: The game runs with the Java engine, which restricted them to do anything much with higher-level graphics, however the game again really does resent old games as mentioned which could also be a reason why they kept the graphics the way it is, but compared to modern games and what you can really do with visuals, this would be medium rated. There are a few cut scenes in the game which still used fully the game mechanics, however with switched over and close-up angle directed camera, although with this being the visuals it is suitable for any age group of audiences.\n\nAudio: The OST is made by Harry Mack, which did a truly amazing job of making the game sound really old-school, keeping the styles of 8-bit music from the time, but using newer technology and sound systems such as the strings, and so on. The soundtrack of this game is very diverse when comparing to any other RPG game, since this is a cartoon/fantasy type. With the game being free to play, Three Rings did not invest too much in putting 'voices' into the game, so therefore there was no voice acting, but even without it-- The game plays itself with all the dialogues coming up as comicified themed speech bubbles that do not disturb the player's gameplay. You probably wouldn't find any other game's soundtrack feeling "old school" style of the original 8-bit gaming music that sounds really modern as Spiral Knights'.\n\nReception: As the reception goes, there are many awards and positive comments on it from communities such as "Ars Technica", "Wired" and "PC Gamer". In 2011, the Game Developers Choice Online Awards has nominated Spiral Knights as "Best Visual Online Arts, Best Online Game Design, Best Audio for an Online Game, and Best New Online Game". It was awarded for the "Best" Online Game Design. Most of the reception and comments also really do find the game really addicting as far as the community goes, 2 year after its initial release-- Over 3 million accounts were registered and having near a million active per day.","January 3, 2013","true","041.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fangelic/recommended/99900/","Fangelic","Fangel+","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fangelic/","195 products in account","Spiral Knights is, as I like to call it, a "cutesy dungeon crawler". The game takes place in various depths of a mechanical planet that is always shifting and changing. With very easy to understand gameplay and lots of replayability, Spiral Knights is a wonderful game to sit down with for a few hours and slash, shoot, and bomb things with your friends.\n\nTHE GOOD Easy to learn, but many advanced fighting tactics.\nIt's free!\nEver-changing and randomized dungeons in the Arcade!\nEverything you need is achieveable in-game without paying up. Paying is purely for cosmetics, or to speed up the grind a bit.\nMarket and player trading. Trade items on the auction house, sell or buy premium currency with your in-game earned money, or trade for either between players. You can even trade items with other players on Steam!\nIn-depth story, along with various mini-stories throughout the game. Lot of lore to get invested in!\nWeakness and resistance systems.\nLots of weapons, armors, and shields for you to craft or purchase from others!\nA silly chat filter that can be disabled if you so please.\nA startlingly vast cosmetic system with costume appearances and accessories to let you customize yourself.\nTwo PvP gamemodes - control points and bomberman.\nRotating events with unique rewards!\nUnique Variants of gear that you can get as a bonus for crafting that allow for your gear to get super powerful!\nMany friendly and helpful players await in the game. Don't try to get them to play the game for you, but many of them are willing to help!\nTHE BAD Depending on your location, connection to the servers might be horrendous. There are only two servers, one located on the east coast of the US, the other one located in Ireland. While you may get a fair connection to these servers, anyone with a better connection will almost always outperform you, which can make PvP gamemodes stupid unfair.\nMoney = Power. You can purchase unique variants (they're randomized so you can't exactly choose) to make your gear very powerful, and there are no downsides to this the more money you have. In the PvE mode which is most of the game this is great, but in PvP it's an unfair advantage.\nSmall dev team. Spiral Knights used to have a much larger development team, but in the 4 years of its life it's lost a good amount of them. This slows updates drastically, but luckily doesn't pull out what the game already has going for it.\nMeta gear. There are only so many good pieces of gear, and sadly defense doesn't matter more often than not.\nTrap gear. Certain gear lines do not extend very far at all, and can act as a trap for new players who haven't done research into their gear beforehand. A good asset to use before crafting gear is the Spiral Knights wiki, which will lay out alchemy lines. The end goal is a five-star item, so make sure your gear ends there!\nVery minor communication. The development team and game masters don't communicate too openly with the players. They may be listening but it's hard to know.\nTHE UGLY Unobtainable gear. Certain items in the game were introduced in limited-time promotions, and are unique. The Overcharged Mixmaster being the only weapon to have its attack pattern, plus its desireable combat stats only adds salt to the wound. Luckily not too many items of this type exist, but it's still something to mention.\nOverly competitive players. Certain players will make a huge stink about anything - and luckily these are typically confined into the PvP games. Plenty of nice and friendly people in the PvP games as well, but you're more likely to run into the bad apples in there.\nProgress walls. The game is pretty terrible at pacing the main storyline, and so while new players are racing through the first half of the game, they'll occasionally bump into progress walls. The first two are not really noticable, but the final two will halt all progress until you upgrade a certain amount of gear. These progress walls are only really a huge issue because of pacing, so if you don't limit yourself to the story missions the progress walls will be much more tolerable.\nEnd-game. Yes, the end-game is pretty lackluster. You aren't really given much direction, so you just fine-tune your gear, create new gear and try it out, attempt to hone your skills, or quit for a while. Doesn't help that leveling up your end-game gear is a rather large time/money investment, and that the best places to get the items for leveling up your end-game gear is in the hardest levels the game has to offer, meaning if you're new to the end-game it's kind of hard to be competitive.\nOverall the game has a lot going on for it, but time has left it a bit behind. Over 4000 hours in this game on Steam and I can honestly say I don't regret a single minute. It's simple, it's fun, it's cute, and it has really fun people in it. The bad and ugly parts aren't uncommon in games at this point, and if you just want to hack and slash things and have a fair amount of time to kill, this is a lovely game. If you hate games with grinds, you probably aren't looking into MMOs anyways, but Spiral Knights has very grindy moments.\n\nTL;DR - Game is fun, has a bit of a grind, and issues with pacing players, but at the end of the day you're smashes faces in for free.

Let's just say that the game has passed from getting your so wished armour into trying to look cool because yes, now you don't grind for the 5* armour, you will grind for the ideal costume, believe me, It has become into that.\nNow looking into the Pay to win aspect, which is not totally wrong, you may pay and instantly skip to get that 5*armour and...\nyou know what I went and just said so much usless information, For the real point, if you hav someone to play with it is quite atractive and fun, but otherwise playing alone, nope that time has been long gone, solo playing was good before. Now I'd solely recomend to play with friends, beside a good part of the community are good persons. If you do decide to play solo simply find a good guild and I believe you might enjoy the game.\nOn the other hand there are some unobtainable achievments in the game, they should fix that cause those were old achievments from when the game had those capabilities.","April 13, 2015","true","365.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameply is in stages cartoony fun monsters while you play a cartoony fun character.\n\nThe game does get a bit grindy with 'orbs' if you dont want to pay money to get past having to try and get a bunch of rare rare orb drops so that you can get the higher teir armor. But in my opinion, the grinding is the best part because it makes you get better at the game.\n\nThe bosses are definetly challenging for the tiers. (except for the first one)\n\nThis game has very great gameplay up until you beat the game/get everything you want in the game. They havent really made anything to do afterwards, just a dress up RPG and look cool and maybe manage a guild\n\nOver all I give this game a ★★★★☆, I highly recommend this game.","August 23, 2015","true","269.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lleviathan/recommended/99900/","Lleviathan","Fairy Lleviathan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lleviathan/","169 products in account","This is one of my favorite games, but I'm gonna start out with countering some common complaints I hear before getting onto my own opinions.\n\nPeople complain that "there's not enough content", or that "there's too much content". I'm someone who usually believes that the more content, the better, and if someone believes something other than that, I respect that, because it's entirely valid. The arguement I'm not OK with? The arguement that it's impossible to advance in the game without paying!\n\nHere's the thing: people flip out about how this game is "pay-to-win" and how it's impossible to get past 4* gear without paying real world money.\n\nAlrighty, I'll admit, back in the day when Mist Energy was still a thing, the game was definatly leaning on pay-to-win. But even then, you could in theory do everything with enough grinding. Post-update, the only thing you'd really pay real world money to get is cosmetic items, which, again, in theory you could save up crowns for to trade for. No one's forcing you to buy them, and now one is forcing you to buy weapons either.\n\nAnyway, my main complaint with the game is that sadly, there's a ton of balancing issues, especially in PVP. PVP is usually just a bunch of dudes with the same old swords and armor tearing each other up with the occasional guy with the Polaris. Bombers can't do much other than spread status, which is dubiously helpful at best. In the clockworks, everything's for the most part good, except certain weapon lines are totally outclassed. I feel kinda bad for the people who went for the Cautery Sword, the Deconstructor, the Pepperbox, the Spur, and other abruptly ending or dubiously useful lines. My other problem is that players don't know what items are good unless they ask others. Perhaps there should be a feature that allows players to try out different weapons without buying them, or at least something that shows how far weapon lines extend, star wise.\n\nNow for my positive stuff: the game is an amazing hack-and-slash MMO that plays really well. It actually gives me vague memories of the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicals games, which were some of my old favorites. The enemies are creative: with things somewhat familiar, like Gremlins and Zombies, to things that are totally cool and never-before-seen, including most of the Fiend family. The Slime family deserves a special mention for putting a cool new twist on the concept of "gelatinous cube". The bosses are fun and engaging: the epic feeling I got as a new player when I fought the Snarbolax alone for the first time was something I'll remember for a long time. The seasonal events are great too - as rather bothersome as parts of it are, the Apocrea event is probably one of my favorites. The player base is for the most part friendly. Guild life is fun, and most players will help you out with missions if you need them to.\n\nIn conclusion, Spiral Knights is one of the few MMOs that I actually enjoy, and while it does have some issues, it's still fun, and those issues could be fixed. This is my first review pretty much, so hopefully I did everything right.","July 18, 2014","true","283.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Vast improvements to the crafting of items and forging encourage you to keep playing. And the graphics are still pretty good, even today.\n\nThis game has had a terrible past as oldies like me know. Having to wait for your energy to recharge and boring "NEW BOX!" patches being the only thing that was being added, as well as inflated crystal energy prices (anybody else remember them at 2000-3000 per 100?) used to make this a very "meh" experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ali_Morrisane/recommended/99900/","Ali_Morrisane","Zerofyne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ali_Morrisane/","154 products in account","Play this game.\n\nIt's a dungeon crawler MMORPG with a dash of zelda inserted for good measure. The old 'free' mist energy may have been scrapped, but so have energy costs for elevators and alchemy. In short, buying energy with real money is now a shortcut, not a necessity. It's perfectly possible to play through the entire main game (i.e. the 'rank' missions) completely free.\n\nThere are no 'character levels', but your equipment gains 'heat' (basically exp), and after a certain amount is collected, you can level it up via the forge. Weapons 'evolve' through alchemy, and new weapons can be crafted via alchemy.\n\nThe main game has you play as a knight who completes various missions which revolve around exploring what is known as the clockworks and fighting various monsters there. Rank missions involve you exploring 2-3 levels of the clockworks each time, whereas using the arcade lets you explore more freely - once you've done enough rank missions, you can go from 'depth 0' to 'depth 29' in a single run.\n\nThe levels within the clockworks get progressively harder as you go deeper, and there are four main bosses to kill (as many times as you want) - and that's not including the difficult 'shadow lairs'. I feel that there's an emphasis on teamwork throughout the game (working as a team to complete missions makes it easier and you still get the same drops) and somewhat on player skill later on (even with excellent equipment, you'll still die if you're bad with a shield).\n\nIt should be said, however, that if you don't wish to fork out any cash for energy, then you may find that the grinding required to advance throughout the game may prove too repetitive and boring - experienced MMO players probably won't suffer from this issue, however.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a great game for those who enjoy MMOs, exploration and adventure.

It's kept extremely simple, which makes it a great casual game that I can pick up and drop off without intense involvement. This is a good pizza-and-mouse game, meaning you can play one-handed due to the simplicity of the controls. It's a nice, calm, relaxing game, with stretches of tension and frustration. It's FtP, so there's limits on how much you can do in a 24 hour span, which kind of helps keeps me from seeing the limitations of the campaign missions. The skirmish missions are always different, but to clear a campaign, you must fight the same enemies on the same map. It has a difficulty spike in some areas. I love the visual design, and the music is an awesome combination of eight-bit and chill. Some of the collecting and trading aspects are difficult, as it isn't always easy to find someone who will buy what you want, even though it is extremely easy to buy items from others at the sub-ten tiers.  8.5/10.","April 23, 2012","true","54.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The loot you get from basic missions has no value. Like NO value. The Tutorial felt rushed and it took me about half 'n hour to figure them all out. The custimization in it didn't seem seem too good either. All the cosmetics looked the same to me. But in games like TF2 or Payday 1 and 2 the cosmetic items look very differnt and unique. So I justed stopped playing when I got to the part when I have to pay or else it's close to impossible. There were also a leveling system I think with xp. But there didn't seem like there was much of an award for leveling up. 2/10","March 24, 2014","false","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aggron521/recommended/99900/","Aggron521","Aggron521","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aggron521/","","I decided to review this game because I played extensivly and I have a feeling I can write a review based on my knowledge. Anyways this is my first review so if I make some sort of mistake let it slide.\n\nSo this game is Spiral Knights, a MMORPG that has a kinda in depth story, the story goes as follows apparently you are in a ship it's attacked, its about to blow up and you and all of your shipmates land on the Clockworks where monsters and creatures live in some hostile but some friendly. Spiral Knights also has a rank system which grants you the ability to make and weild/use better equipment. They are 10 ranks each with their own quests. But a big turn-down though is that sometimes there is a Hall of Heroes quest which requires you to have _ * Equipment...All of it. This leads to grinding for materials and Orbs of Alchemy, different types. Sometimes you can get stuck in this game because of this so the only choice you got is to save up those orbs. you are gonna need at least 15 orbs of whatever type to make the armor alongside other materials. However you eventually get this creature called a Battle Sprite which can help you fight but it wont attack by itself with default attacks, in fact it doesn't have a default attack which means you are responsible for any losses you have which can be a pain if you suck. Luckily it is pretty fun in general. Leveling up your Battle Sprite so it's stronger, getting new armor, weapons and sheilds, doing a quest for the first time, finding rare items. But it all boils down to do you like MMORPG's in general.\n\nMy ending note is this, Spiral Knights can be fun (and in some casses addicting) but it is much more fun with friends and when you are part of a guild. Either way making Armor and weapons aren't that fun and grinding can really be annoying but the amount of fun I have in each quest backs it up, if anything I think the best part for me is my Battle Sprite... Since this doesn't really have a rating system (Kinda but not really) I would give it a rating of 7/10. Its fun if you like RPGs and Doing quests and MMOs so. If you like these things I reccomend it, it is free so go for it if you wanna.","August 7, 2014","true","48.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The old 'free' mist energy may have been scrapped, but so have energy costs for elevators and alchemy. In short, buying energy with real money is now a shortcut, not a necessity. It's perfectly possible to play through the entire main game (i.e. the 'rank' missions) completely free.\n\nThere are no 'character levels', but your equipment gains 'heat' (basically exp), and after a certain amount is collected, you can level it up via the forge. Weapons 'evolve' through alchemy, and new weapons can be crafted via alchemy.\n\nThe main game has you play as a knight who completes various missions which revolve around exploring what is known as the clockworks and fighting various monsters there. Rank missions involve you exploring 2-3 levels of the clockworks each time, whereas using the arcade lets you explore more freely - once you've done enough rank missions, you can go from 'depth 0' to 'depth 29' in a single run.\n\nThe levels within the clockworks get progressively harder as you go deeper, and there are four main bosses to kill (as many times as you want) - and that's not including the difficult 'shadow lairs'. I feel that there's an emphasis on teamwork throughout the game (working as a team to complete missions makes it easier and you still get the same drops) and somewhat on player skill later on (even with excellent equipment, you'll still die if you're bad with a shield).\n\nIt should be said, however, that if you don't wish to fork out any cash for energy, then you may find that the grinding required to advance throughout the game may prove too repetitive and boring - experienced MMO players probably won't suffer from this issue, however.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a great game for those who enjoy MMOs, exploration and adventure.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linkalee/recommended/99900/","linkalee","Linkalee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linkalee/","126 products in account","Ah, Spiral Knights. How can I keep this recommendation within the character limit. Well, it's a free-to-play action-based MMO, but it remains free-to-play due to a mechanic that allows only so much playtime each day. And if you get addicted, which you will, you need to at least buy a monthly pass, that's basically required to enjoy the game anyway, unless you only have an hour or two to play each day anyway, in which case this is a perfect system for you. The game starts out easy, the controls are very simple, and they recently added an optional tutorial/questing system, which makes it even easier to start playing. However, things get insanely challenging later on. Bullet hells, spike hells, fiery helly hells. There are even special areas made just to be cruel hells. Admittedly it gets easier once you become experienced and know what to expect, but there are still areas that are basically impossible to progress through solo. This game will teach you how to use a shield, I'll say that.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI'm changing this recommendation from positive to negative. This game is dying. A year ago, this was an underappreciated gem of an MMO. There was new content being regularly released for free that drew you in, and then while you were here there were cosmetics and boosts that you could pay for if you wanted to. This is how the free-to-play model should work, content that draws you in and keeps you playing while simultaneously not being locked behind a paywall and being open to anyone, whether they pay or not. And for the most part, this model still applies to new players who haven't experienced all the content yet.\n\nBut the new content updates that comprise the backbone of this model have long since died off. Promises were made and never kept, the lead developer upped and left, and a noticeably large chunk of the playerbase has died off due to boredom. It feels like a lot of drive and inspiration has been lost and Three Rings thinks it can fill this void with shiny "new" reskins and repeating event content and hope that no one notices while they try to piece everything back together behind the scenes, IF they're trying to piece everything back together behind the scenes, maybe they aren't. It's been over a year now and there are STILL a bunch of unfixed problems and bugs related to the sprites update that was released just before everything fell apart.\n\nExamples: Some minerals have no purpose and get stuck in your inventory; sprites have a level numbering system that makes no sense, the "true" max level is some number over 100 that the game doesn't tell you; the only way of knowing that you've reached this "true" max level is that your sprite glitches out and stops accepting levelup food; and there are quite a few balance issues with pet abilties and ultimates, some are even outright bugs themselves.\n\n(Seraphynx's Violent Heart Attack ultimate causes targets enchanted with Heart Attack to explode. Sounds cool, right? It does until you realize that the explosion does almost zero damage even in tier three and is really only good for breaking blocks. And the alternative ultimate, Iron Heart Attack, has a chance to drop defense orbs that maybe cushion half a pip's worth of damage, also in tier three. Take your pick between useless and more useless. In fact, just stay away from Seraphynx in general, its first ability has a deceptively large hitbox combined with a maximum hit limit per enemy that makes no sense, its second ability is very unreliable and might not even have an effect at all, and its third ability has too small of a radius to be useful in the team setting that it's meant to be useful in and has only enough health for one, maaaaaaybe two hits for everyone and not per person, it's mostly just for running over traps that you're too impatient to wait for. Hell, the other non-defense-oriented sprites have BETTER individual defensive abilities than the defense-oriented sprite, because the defense sprite is meant for providing defense for the whole team, yet the balance just isn't there to actually provide reliable and worthwhile defensive abilities for multiple people simultaneously, it's better if everyone just brought their own Flame Barrier and Shadow Cloak buffs and went from there. Unless you just like shiny cosmetic kittens, of course.)\n\nPhew.\n\nMy point is, these things are acceptable for a month or two after a big update, not a year, and the fact that so little has changed to make the game better in that time tells me that they've probably stopped caring about Spiral Knights altogether. If you're new to the game you will have all sorts of fun in everything that's been established already, but don't invest too much into your future here, at the rate things are going you won't have much of one.","February 27, 2012","false","334.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kulnar/recommended/99900/","Kulnar","Kulnar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kulnar/","17 products in account","Good game, however, the energy system is the worst free to play system I've ever seen in a game, basically you can play for free, but you can't do anything without energy which you need to buy. 100 Mist energy is the maximum energy a free to play account has which equals to five quests. Mist energy regenerates 1 energy each 13 minutes. The worst part being that if you die in a quest(instance) you need energy to revive, if you don't spend that energy, you go back to town and that 20 mist energy you paid for the quest, is now gone and you made 0 progress within the game. And if you buy crystal energy (the one that doesn't regenerate) you have only what you've paid for. I'd rather pay 50 bucks and play forever (until a DLC/expansion comes out). And don't tell me that this game is worth more than 50 bucks because it isn't. If I want to play something worth my money I would rather choose something like Guild Wars 2.\nGood things about this game? The co-op is very enjoyable, the ranking system is fun, the arcade system is basically an (almost) endless mode of instances and crafting could be better, a little complexity here and there won't hurt.\nRating (from someone you don't know/care about) = 5/10.\nHell, not enough energy to rate higher.

Many ways to play yet simplistic.\n\n~Game community is very good and still better compared to other MMO's I have personally seen, and guilds and their halls are greatly refined to freshen up the experience for many players, and coax guilds to work together to build their halls to great lengths and maintaining upkeep, and working towards boss statues later on as they grow.\n\nCons:\n\n~Player controlled economy maintains the idea that more or less than half the player base will pay real money for the in game commodity, Crystal Energy, and will push it into the market for free to play players to buy with their earned crowns, now the problem in this is, that, the company, Three Rings entertainment, doesn't directly control the market and instead uses risky marketing methods, such as flash sales, promotions, prize boxes, and auction house featured flagship items and accessories and more, in hopes that players will buy more Crystal energy to obtain such things, which I think is not a bad marketing technique, but that would technically mean the game isn't entire Free for the whole player base, whether they spend or not, so in order to have energy, someone, somewhere in this game has to spent money and put it up on the market, so that the free player may obtain the same resource for free without real life money and instead in game goods. I call it a con because the economy is unstable and needs to be deflated at times, but as long as Three Rings can keep the market from inflating too much, I suppose this isn't such a big matter, but as I say with thus being said, this game isn't free for everyone.\n\n~Players who prefer to be solo in the game may not get such a refined experience and may not play this game much considering the game itself doesn't offer too much for single player features, and reasons to stay in the game, some MMO's can be done entirely single, but the level design is too simplistic just for one player to analyze and enjoy long term, as there are certain limitations in place.\n\n~Updates are quite slow due to the small development team, and there isn't really a whole lot of content for end gamers to enjoy, thus making the community solely keep some players from quitting because of the theoretical experience of playing with others making it more enjoyable.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\n~Play this game, see how you like it, it has a great lore that keeps theories coming almost like FnaF (though not as much lol) there are guilds, and still quite a bit of good mannered players and potential friends to make here, and the combat system while only having 3 types of technical weapon classes and sprite types, yet the large arsenal available allows anyone to create their own style of playing, silly or serious, or just something to do the job.\n\n7/10 Satisfactory\n\n","May 13, 2015","true","579.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You don't have to get it but it feels nicer to have it, especially in times where it's tough.\n\nHowever, do not expect to get through the game with owning one set of armor and weapons at a time. Certainplaces contain certain enemies and hazards that may make you weaker or stronger depending on your gear, and playing with friends is often a must.\n\nIt may seem at first that you don't have to put much effort into fighing, but you have to pay attention to your enemies and their projectiles. Glowing areas on the ground indicate where an enemy is going to attack, but you need to act quickly to dodge it. Projectiles need to be watched for, and may sometimes come to you a-la bullet hell games.\n\nMy only complaints are that you cannot equip many weapons at one time and to do that you have to rent, let me repeat myself, RENT, extra slots to equip more items. Often you have to resort to getting things from the community marketplace because getting them from stages can be a chore and often shops won't have what you need, thus having to deal with the sometimes ludicrous prices of greedy players.\n\nAnd on a final note you will have these things called Sparks of Life. You can use them when you die more than once or use them on fallen teammates who also died more than once. However as a word of caution, use them sparingly, as they're hard to come by through normal gameplay, but can be bought with energy, which in my opinion, sparks are the stuff you should buy the most, because, if you're struggling on a level and you don't have them, you're screwed.","October 22, 2015","true","73.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Three Rings puts heavy emphasis on co-op play, and it is certainly far more fun with more people.\n\nProblem is, Three Rings updates the game slower than molasses going uphill in January with crutches. The only thing that can keep you hooked to the game is a desire(and the money) to do the Shadow Lairs, or a desire to play PvP and the money to be able to do buttshit in it. The only thing that can diversify equipment is a random Unique Variant system, and if you don't have the luck or money to get the best UVs, you might as well not play PvP at all.\n\nStill, Spiral Knights is amazing for a F2P.

When I officially got Spiral Knights for steam, I had already like 4 star armor. Honestly, this game has gone to ♥♥♥♥. There are only THREE tiers! Tier 1 : A Boss Named Snarbolax Tier 2 : Jelly King / Queen and The Romolous Twins Tier 3 : Vanaduke . Now , if you want to buy gear in this game THATS A ♥♥♥♥ING PROBLEM!! Everything is SO overly priced! This game is F2P but the game ♥♥♥♥in BEGS you to use real money on it. I used to play this with my friend and it was fun, but it has gone to complete and utter ♥♥♥♥!! You need to keep grinding the same ♥♥♥♥ing levels for who the ♥♥♥♥ knows how many times in a day to get "rich". I will just go right out and say it, if you are not rich or you arent at least a gamer girl, You will find it SUPER hard to get ANY online friends. Sure if you are 5 star you can pickup a guy that is 1 star or a newbie as a friend, but here me out, HE/SHE WILL ♥♥♥♥ING BEG YOU FOR MONEY NON-STOP. Now if you actually get a "girlfriend / boyfriend" and they are lower star than you,  THEY WILL ♥♥♥♥ING BEG YOU TO DEATH FOR CROWNS.  Now I keep saying Stars and Crowns and let me explain. Crowns are the in-game money and Stars are like a ranking for gear in-game. SERIOUSLY I have been playing this game for 5 years min. And taken about 3 years of a break. Why? BECAUSE THE GAME IS SO ♥♥♥♥ING GRINDY ITS NOT FUNNY ANYMORE. I SWEAR, WHEN YOU GET TO TIER 3, ALL YOU WILL ♥♥♥♥ING DO, IS GRIND VANADUKE, CAUSE IT FIVES YOU ABOUT 8K + EVERY LEVEL BUT IT IS SO ♥♥♥♥ING BORING!! You try to change it up a bit a do Snarbolax or Jelly King / Queen but I promise you that you WILL go back to Vanaduke cause being rich in-game is SO important , you WILL regret it!! Basically, what I am trying to say here, you probably should not play this game if you are not willing to pay in-game money.","January 10, 2015","false","454.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Free-To-Play.\nMeaning, you CAN play for free.. but a lot of the beginning grind can be removed with a few small purchases of the ingame "Energy", which can help you develop your gear faster and start earning more of the ingame currency, "Crowns".\n\nSaying that, the game CAN be completely Free-to-Play if you choose. Be prepaired to run some of the lower levels quite a lot as you try and rank your gear up.\n\nI would recommend researching different types of weapons and armor in the game. At the beginning you are provided a large variety of weapons via Missions, which reflect the different weapon types, and different variations of each weapon (Swords, Guns and Bombs).\n\n-Pro's:\nEasy going, Fun, and the community is generally very friendly.\n\n-Con's:\ncan take a little while to get started, and at the beginning earning Crowns can seem very difficult. this is all part of the learning curve of the game, and any necessary purchases in the game will correlate to the mission rewards that you get. If you don't waste your crowns when you start, then you will be fine... But it's very important to not waste crowns on useless things you do not need at the beginning.\n\nOverall, I have played SK for around 2 months now. I started playing standalone, and then switched my account to the Steam version. I managed to reach the highest rank, Vanguard, and STILL enjoy playing the game. That's a hard thing for a game to achieve in my eyes, and I believe they have been successful with this.","July 16, 2014","true","239.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can run around the game and waste your time collecting something that you think will move your character forwars, in stead of paying money for a quick route to finishing line, which keeps on moving on. This seems old too quickly and seems like a one trick pony did it's purpose. And then you want to remove it and a bit regret the time wasted, that's not easy after all.\n\nItems that the game gives to you cannot be removed or transferred by steam account so there they stay and seem to be impossible to remove and only after reinstall of the game and removal of all in game accounts can every trace of the game removed from your steam account.\nSo remember to do that or you end up downloading it back again one day just to remove it.","June 29, 2014","false","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Tried multi-box farming and other "non-normal" way to make money before the patch that removes energy requirement on elevator. So you know I am not those casual players with less than 20 hours game time who will be shouting "omg this game is so fun so cute, play it and you will never regret".\n\nThe gameplay was fun, but grind wall hits me hard after about 20 hours of gameplay--just like almost every other free-to-play game out there.\n\nFor example, in order to do higher level content, you can:\n1. play this game everyday for an hour for 2 weeks so that you accumulates enough mats which could upgrade your gears\n2. forget about life, forget about work, grind countinously and get those gears in a single day\n3. swipe your card and purchase gears directly from the in-game auction house\n\nI quited playing seriously simply because the game was not rewarding enough based on the time I invested in this game. But I still log back in once in awhile just to listen to the music and slash some enemies.\n\nRecent patches are always cash-oriented, which, for sure, increase the grind level of this game in general.\n\nIn conclusion, Spiral Knights is a medicore F2P game. Gameplay is interesting and unique, but it requires serious grinding to get anything you want. I would recommend playing it casually--explore the world, try out new things, and log off. If you want to play this game hardcore, it will be very repetitive, frustrating, and time-consuming.","October 23, 2014","false","112.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is fun, vibrant and is both simple enough to pick up, and compelling enough to not put down. 2 years ago, I would say that once you get over the mist system, it's an excellent game I hope to see grow to be even better.\n2 years later, I cannot reccommend this game wholeheartily due to the missteps it has taken. There is no getting past the top-heavy 'first act' of the game, restricting leveling system, redundancy-by-proxy mission system, and lack of an endgame.\nThese decisions and the overall lack of content to explore being added in any fashion sour the game experience for me.

Why not saying "Hey you can ad so and so many things to your armor or take it of as you please. But if you want to wear more than x things than you have to pay for slots" which would also result in a far better customization Menu, and would bring allot more depth into the game and still would keep that buying or earning option, just in a not so rediclues way.\n\n#2 Difficulty!\nWhile this doesn't matter to everyone the most of you it does. It is rediclues easy. Up until this point I was walking allone! Allone! In a 4 Player Coop Game! Unlike Borderlands never be meant to play Alone! In the Hardest Difficulty! And I got easily trough! Only the boss figts where a bit tough so second hardest dificulty! What the frick? After 20 Hours? Nothing?\n\nSo much I would love this game, this kills it for me!.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/getdeceived/recommended/99900/","getdeceived","❤❤❤❤","http://steamcommunity.com/id/getdeceived/","12 products in account","This was a good game.\n\nAs most other reviews mention, yes, this used to be a fun game.\nNow? It's plain bad. VERY bad. Think as bad as Runescape and you aren't far.\n(On a side note, are all ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes programmed in Java cursed to be bad?)\nSure, you may be thinking "This is an angry rant, not a review". Well, let's see...\n\nIn the past, there was a thing called Mist Energy (Mist = Free, Crystal = In-Game or Real Money),\nup to a max of 100 at a time. If you don't play the game and didn't come across the concept in the reviews, Energy is used for the main aspects in the game. While it restricted daily playtime for free players, it encouraged cooperative gameplay, which, in turn made the community overall a nice bunch.\nNowadays, you get to play as much as you want (there was a 10 Energy fee for entering levels),\nbut everything else is slow and tedious to do. Take crafting for instance; Previously, you crafted things with Energy. It took a chunk of time, but it was pretty doable until higher levels. Today, you have to get "Crystals" to craft items.\nThey are paid with energy or found, but are:\nIf playing levels, as rare as a cold glass of soda in a desert\nIf buying with in-game currency, a 3-weeks-average grindfest to craft an item\nIf buying with real money, an "I am rich" showcase of your many 5-star items\nAnd then comes the forge system. You see, you need heat (too!) to improve your weapons, and there are up to 10 levels of heat. Previously, heat level raised automatically (ala level up when you have enough exp).\nCurrently, heat levels are increased when you provide "Embers" to a forge. The main flaws of this system are:\nThey suffer from the same problems of Crystals\nForges are only found outside missions\nTherefore, you lose many potential heat levels while searching for Embers.\n\nAnd now, *drumroll*...\n\nUPDATES!\n\nThe updates are many, but few can be actually called updates. You may be wondering what do I mean by this. Well, most updates are cosmetics which have little to no effect on gameplay. 99.99% of those are silly recolors of 5 star items or costumes, which cost either a zillon coins or $100 of your local currency. The major updates are seldom released (the most recent having been released 4 months ago), with the majority of them being missions or equipment, with gameplay changes being perjudicial (well, only making elevators free helped players).\nNot to mention that none of them added to the main storyline. That's right, folks! When the main storyline is over, you have little or nothing left to do.\n\nLet's talk about the miscellania of content here: PvP and Shadow Lairs.\n\nPvP? Craft a 5 star weapon with attack speed and damage UVs (read: modifiers), suit yourself in an armor with similar modifiers (now you know why everyone runs around in wolf costumes) and you are ready to go. Enough said.\n\nShadow Lairs? I have to admit, now that looks like something fun to do. Problem is, you need Shadow Keys to enter and a lot of Sparks of Life (used to revive) for this, both being ridiculously expensive. And, except the Shadow Key, that goes for all your fellow party members (you'll definitely want to have a full party before entering). This is the ultimate challenge in the game, but as such, it is the ultimate money sink (aside from crafting, that is).\n\nNow, if you want to play the game anyways, I won't stop you. But remember this: There are many better games out there, don't waste your time on this one unless you like seeing knights in shiny armor and impressive weapons while having a crappy semi-automatic laser pistol and that armor you managed to craft after 2 months of grinding.","September 26, 2014","false","320.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's kept extremely simple, which makes it a great casual game that I can pick up and drop off without intense involvement. This is a good pizza-and-mouse game, meaning you can play one-handed due to the simplicity of the controls. It's a nice, calm, relaxing game, with stretches of tension and frustration. It's FtP, so there's limits on how much you can do in a 24 hour span, which kind of helps keeps me from seeing the limitations of the campaign missions. The skirmish missions are always different, but to clear a campaign, you must fight the same enemies on the same map. It has a difficulty spike in some areas. I love the visual design, and the music is an awesome combination of eight-bit and chill. Some of the collecting and trading aspects are difficult, as it isn't always easy to find someone who will buy what you want, even though it is extremely easy to buy items from others at the sub-ten tiers.  8.5/10.","April 23, 2012","true","54.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is basicly a child-friendly dungeon crawler that is easy in the beginning but once you get to the arcade things get real! One of my friends and I almost BOTH died on the arcade levels.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fagggetsd/recommended/99900/","fagggetsd","Hulk/Hellboy/Flash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fagggetsd/","56 products in account","Spiral knights is a game that I never thought would be this good. It's set up in a very interesting artificial world whose characteristics blend perfectly with the game features. The spiral knights (players), are newcomers to this world and are so far limited to a small section of the surface. Because of this, they need to explore its depths in to improve the toehold they have on it.\n\nThere are two main resources in spiral knights: crowns, which are the game's form of currency, and energy which is needed to activate the elevators and doors which allow the player to explore the world, as well as crafting all kinds of gear. While crowns are dropped by defeated enemies, energy can only gained by the pass of time (called mist energy and limited to 100 per account), purchased from other players using crowns (in the form of energy crystals), or purchased using real money.\n\nAccess to energy is the main difference between paying and free customers, but thanks to the inclusion of an energy market in the game's currency, free players can enjoy all the features the game has to offer though more slowly than paying customers.\n\nSo far I have been playing the game for free, and I'm having a blast. I also appreciate that the game is so friendly towards free customers (specially those who are too busy and cannot spend more than a couple of hours playing every day). Most likely I will start spending real money as I go further down the game, but for the moment I'm perfectly fine with the free version. This is a game I would definitely recommend you give it a go.\n","June 2, 2014","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let's just say that the game has passed from getting your so wished armour into trying to look cool because yes, now you don't grind for the 5* armour, you will grind for the ideal costume, believe me, It has become into that.\nNow looking into the Pay to win aspect, which is not totally wrong, you may pay and instantly skip to get that 5*armour and...\nyou know what I went and just said so much usless information, For the real point, if you hav someone to play with it is quite atractive and fun, but otherwise playing alone, nope that time has been long gone, solo playing was good before. Now I'd solely recomend to play with friends, beside a good part of the community are good persons. If you do decide to play solo simply find a good guild and I believe you might enjoy the game.\nOn the other hand there are some unobtainable achievments in the game, they should fix that cause those were old achievments from when the game had those capabilities.","April 13, 2015","true","365.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fangelic/recommended/99900/","Fangelic","Fangel+","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fangelic/","195 products in account","Spiral Knights is, as I like to call it, a "cutesy dungeon crawler". The game takes place in various depths of a mechanical planet that is always shifting and changing. With very easy to understand gameplay and lots of replayability, Spiral Knights is a wonderful game to sit down with for a few hours and slash, shoot, and bomb things with your friends.\n\nTHE GOOD Easy to learn, but many advanced fighting tactics.\nIt's free!\nEver-changing and randomized dungeons in the Arcade!\nEverything you need is achieveable in-game without paying up. Paying is purely for cosmetics, or to speed up the grind a bit.\nMarket and player trading. Trade items on the auction house, sell or buy premium currency with your in-game earned money, or trade for either between players. You can even trade items with other players on Steam!\nIn-depth story, along with various mini-stories throughout the game. Lot of lore to get invested in!\nWeakness and resistance systems.\nLots of weapons, armors, and shields for you to craft or purchase from others!\nA silly chat filter that can be disabled if you so please.\nA startlingly vast cosmetic system with costume appearances and accessories to let you customize yourself.\nTwo PvP gamemodes - control points and bomberman.\nRotating events with unique rewards!\nUnique Variants of gear that you can get as a bonus for crafting that allow for your gear to get super powerful!\nMany friendly and helpful players await in the game. Don't try to get them to play the game for you, but many of them are willing to help!\nTHE BAD Depending on your location, connection to the servers might be horrendous. There are only two servers, one located on the east coast of the US, the other one located in Ireland. While you may get a fair connection to these servers, anyone with a better connection will almost always outperform you, which can make PvP gamemodes stupid unfair.\nMoney = Power. You can purchase unique variants (they're randomized so you can't exactly choose) to make your gear very powerful, and there are no downsides to this the more money you have. In the PvE mode which is most of the game this is great, but in PvP it's an unfair advantage.\nSmall dev team. Spiral Knights used to have a much larger development team, but in the 4 years of its life it's lost a good amount of them. This slows updates drastically, but luckily doesn't pull out what the game already has going for it.\nMeta gear. There are only so many good pieces of gear, and sadly defense doesn't matter more often than not.\nTrap gear. Certain gear lines do not extend very far at all, and can act as a trap for new players who haven't done research into their gear beforehand. A good asset to use before crafting gear is the Spiral Knights wiki, which will lay out alchemy lines. The end goal is a five-star item, so make sure your gear ends there!\nVery minor communication. The development team and game masters don't communicate too openly with the players. They may be listening but it's hard to know.\nTHE UGLY Unobtainable gear. Certain items in the game were introduced in limited-time promotions, and are unique. The Overcharged Mixmaster being the only weapon to have its attack pattern, plus its desireable combat stats only adds salt to the wound. Luckily not too many items of this type exist, but it's still something to mention.\nOverly competitive players. Certain players will make a huge stink about anything - and luckily these are typically confined into the PvP games. Plenty of nice and friendly people in the PvP games as well, but you're more likely to run into the bad apples in there.\nProgress walls. The game is pretty terrible at pacing the main storyline, and so while new players are racing through the first half of the game, they'll occasionally bump into progress walls. The first two are not really noticable, but the final two will halt all progress until you upgrade a certain amount of gear. These progress walls are only really a huge issue because of pacing, so if you don't limit yourself to the story missions the progress walls will be much more tolerable.\nEnd-game. Yes, the end-game is pretty lackluster. You aren't really given much direction, so you just fine-tune your gear, create new gear and try it out, attempt to hone your skills, or quit for a while. Doesn't help that leveling up your end-game gear is a rather large time/money investment, and that the best places to get the items for leveling up your end-game gear is in the hardest levels the game has to offer, meaning if you're new to the end-game it's kind of hard to be competitive.\nOverall the game has a lot going on for it, but time has left it a bit behind. Over 4000 hours in this game on Steam and I can honestly say I don't regret a single minute. It's simple, it's fun, it's cute, and it has really fun people in it. The bad and ugly parts aren't uncommon in games at this point, and if you just want to hack and slash things and have a fair amount of time to kill, this is a lovely game. If you hate games with grinds, you probably aren't looking into MMOs anyways, but Spiral Knights has very grindy moments.\n\nTL;DR - Game is fun, has a bit of a grind, and issues with pacing players, but at the end of the day you're smashes faces in for free. Connection to the server is the only huge issue, and if you can master your own lag, you'll be more than fine in this game.","November 30, 2015","true","465.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azelyra/recommended/99900/","Azelyra","Kirishima Sakura desu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azelyra/","73 products in account","Spiral Knights! A "F2P" (Free To Play) Game released by Three Rings and SEGA back in April 2010.\n\nPlot: The mystery of the story unfolds as you follow your quests down into the depths of Cradle (The planet setting) to know why the Spiral Knights have crashed down onto this mysterious planet. To get out, they will have to harness the energy from "The Core" which lies in the deepest parts of the planet, but with the mysterious machine and world called the "Clockworks" that lies below, the dangers of delving into the planet and the knight's fate will remain unknown... In this ever-changing world. As the game's main storyline is still incomplete, the developers still keeps updating the game. We are surely all thrilled to see what will unfold when "The Core" patch finally releases in the upcoming future.\n\nGameplay and Multiplayer: Spiral Knights is a very interesting co-op dungeon crawler, as it is a face paced gameplay through many diverse environments in the clockworks. As the players will be able to play together to 4 player, it is also a drop-in/drop-out multiplayer which does not affect how you play but make the hostile enemies get a little tougher. It is a top-down third-person real-time action/adventure game which could be compared to some old games for example The Legend of Zelda and so. As for this style, some hardcore gamers that play games like Diablo and so might find this very boring and a little too "old school" for what they call "games" nowadays.\n\nVisuals: The game runs with the Java engine, which restricted them to do anything much with higher-level graphics, however the game again really does resent old games as mentioned which could also be a reason why they kept the graphics the way it is, but compared to modern games and what you can really do with visuals, this would be medium rated. There are a few cut scenes in the game which still used fully the game mechanics, however with switched over and close-up angle directed camera, although with this being the visuals it is suitable for any age group of audiences.\n\nAudio: The OST is made by Harry Mack, which did a truly amazing job of making the game sound really old-school, keeping the styles of 8-bit music from the time, but using newer technology and sound systems such as the strings, and so on. The soundtrack of this game is very diverse when comparing to any other RPG game, since this is a cartoon/fantasy type. With the game being free to play, Three Rings did not invest too much in putting 'voices' into the game, so therefore there was no voice acting, but even without it-- The game plays itself with all the dialogues coming up as comicified themed speech bubbles that do not disturb the player's gameplay. You probably wouldn't find any other game's soundtrack feeling "old school" style of the original 8-bit gaming music that sounds really modern as Spiral Knights'.\n\nReception: As the reception goes, there are many awards and positive comments on it from communities such as "Ars Technica", "Wired" and "PC Gamer". In 2011, the Game Developers Choice Online Awards has nominated Spiral Knights as "Best Visual Online Arts, Best Online Game Design, Best Audio for an Online Game, and Best New Online Game". It was awarded for the "Best" Online Game Design. Most of the reception and comments also really do find the game really addicting as far as the community goes, 2 year after its initial release-- Over 3 million accounts were registered and having near a million active per day.","January 3, 2013","true","041.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quinzal/recommended/99900/","quinzal","Horrible Area","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quinzal/","76 products in account","So much potential. Spiral Knights, in its early days, was a great MMORPG-ish thing with sensical mechanics and easy-to-learn gameplay. It was a great time-burner, trying to get all 5 star gear, running the Firestorm Citadel over and over. Unfortunately, as time passed, things took a turn for the worse. As OOO (or sega or whoever makes updates for this thing now) became more and more ambitious, the updates spiraled off and off into a sense of bleh. Missions were cool. Crimson Hammer was cool. Battle Sprites were cool. Mist energy being removed was passable. Being forced most of the time to spend $20 to upgrade a single piece of gear is not cool. At the advent of the Forge update, the game, while always being sort of a cash grab, became impossible to play. To get decently tiered gear now, you must slave away in T3, because the drops needed almost never actually drop. This has caused many of my friends who I knew to be seasoned veterans of the game to quit. The guild I was in, which had over 50 active players, went inactive a month after the update. Before the update with the Forge, pretty cool. After, not so much.","December 22, 2011","false","559.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

So if you're a tickler for hardcore RPGs and intense storylines, maybe disregard this game as a viable option.\n\nHowever, the charming thing about Spiral Knights is the deep multiplayer capabilities. While there is a rather small 250 friend limit (which I easily capped within a few days), the ability to join a guild and "chillax" in your guild hall is rather fun part of this game. Personally, I am crap at the game's actual gameplay but continue to play it for the simple reason to connect with randoms across the globe.\n\nOverall, as a gamer I would rate this game a 2/10.\n\nHowever, as a human being I would give it an 8 for my love of the Spiral Knights community.","January 9, 2014","true","171.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","2"

Free-To-Play.\nMeaning, you CAN play for free.. but a lot of the beginning grind can be removed with a few small purchases of the ingame "Energy", which can help you develop your gear faster and start earning more of the ingame currency, "Crowns".\n\nSaying that, the game CAN be completely Free-to-Play if you choose. Be prepaired to run some of the lower levels quite a lot as you try and rank your gear up.\n\nI would recommend researching different types of weapons and armor in the game. At the beginning you are provided a large variety of weapons via Missions, which reflect the different weapon types, and different variations of each weapon (Swords, Guns and Bombs).\n\n-Pro's:\nEasy going, Fun, and the community is generally very friendly.\n\n-Con's:\ncan take a little while to get started, and at the beginning earning Crowns can seem very difficult. this is all part of the learning curve of the game, and any necessary purchases in the game will correlate to the mission rewards that you get. If you don't waste your crowns when you start, then you will be fine... But it's very important to not waste crowns on useless things you do not need at the beginning.\n\nOverall, I have played SK for around 2 months now. I started playing standalone, and then switched my account to the Steam version. I managed to reach the highest rank, Vanguard, and STILL enjoy playing the game. That's a hard thing for a game to achieve in my eyes, and I believe they have been successful with this.","July 16, 2014","true","239.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played back in ye olde days before the steam release. For quite a while actually. months of playtime, possibly half a year. I went through the hell that was the CANT LOG IN phase in the game, stopping me from playing for a couple of weeks, which really killed me. That event seriously injured the game, and if I remember, wasa caused by some hacking over at Sega (but dont quote me on that). This little paragraph was just a backstory to what I've been through with this game, just to let you know that I LOVE this game, or atleast used to more than I do now, so the actual review is down below...\nOne last thing, I have not played this game in over a year, but I've looked at the update logs and such, so I atleast know what's happened.\n\nAlright, the pros of this game. The gameplay itself is basic, but not mind-numbingly boring. You move around, attack, pick things up, dodge, etc. Better than most MMO's today, with all that clicking on something to blindly attack whatever bull. The art style of the game is quite nice. The soundtrack...boy, I REALLY like the soundtrack, one of my favorite things about this game. The community (in-game, why this is will be said later...) is probably one of the best things about this game. I made many in-game friends playing this game, some in particular were very nice and cool. And as I see in other reviews, Im not alone. The shop that drives the economy is the auction house, where you can put things up for crowns (currency). There are npc vendors, but I'll be honest, no one uses them, unless they have something unique.\n\nAlright, now the bad stuff, the stuff I really hate to see. In the old days of Spiral Knights, there was mist energy. It regenerated quite slowly up to a maximum of 100. Elevators in the game were used to continue on through the levels, but cost 10 energy to use. So that's basically 10 levels a day, maybe around 12 if you use it at specific times. Crystal energy is considered the premium currency in this game, since every f2p game ever has to have one. But on one fateful day, mist energy was removed, but elevators are now free to use. This was a very smart decision, I thought, except when the rest of the update was revealed. Originally, to craft things, pretty much the only way to get high tier gear, you used energy and materials dropped from enemies. You would also pick up heat for your gear, which is used to level it up and make it better. But then, they added Orbs of Alchmey and Fire Shards. Orbs weren't that awful for me, but only because the game requires you to have a certain level weapon in order to craft the next tier of weapon. With the new fire shards, you had to have a specific fire shard, and depending on the amount you used, would show a percentage that the heat level up would be succesful. So you had to have lady luck on your side unless you want to potentially waste all your crystals on one of 10 heat levels (the max). Basically, the game became a grindfest for orbs and shards (and I didnt mention that lower grade shards cant be combined to make bigger shards, but bigger shards can be smashed into smaller ones. BUT you had to have the recipe to do that, which was given to you when you completed the gear check once you had all the same tier gear. Ex: Full tier 4 gear check, you go through, you can now get tier 5 gear. You get a recipe for smashing tier 5 shards, the ones you need, for tier 4 shards, the ones you USED to need. The system is very broken, and I dont think its changed at all.)\nBefore missions, there was the arcade, a place where gateways led to branches of levels, and players could influence which levels showed up in next weeks gates. This was were you went to actually PLAY the game. That always struck me as interesting. But when the missions came out, you could just skip all those levels and go straight to the boss levels, the main reason people were going down certain gates. Sure, it saved time and wasnt as much as a pain to get there, but missions literally KILLED the arcade. I dont see anyone there anymore, even though it still exists. I just feel it takes some exploration out of the game.\nBut what about the crystals? Now they're used for feeding your pet, which you get through a line of missions. Everyone freaked out at this since every MMO must ALWAYS have pets. When they came out, you could choose a mini dragon that shoots fire, a phantom ghost that shot out caustic needles and could go invisible, and a cat. You know, just a  cat that flies around. Guess which one no one ever picked...(the cat). Thing is, once I got my pet, I used him some, leveled him up a bit, but I always forgot about him. I never used him as often as he was intended, even though when I did remember him, he did help some. Doesn't this show that we have come to not need pets? We played the game to work as a team of knights traversing through the unknown depths of an alien planet, cut off from the rest of our home. Now its more like pet simulator.\nAnd last but CERTAINLY not least, the new updates. I looked at over 30 update logs within the past year or so. All but about 2 had ACTUAL content. The rest of them were just adding limited time reskins of cosmetics, that cost money to get. This is just sad...  this isnt tf2.\n\nOk, so I sound like I dont like this game right? Well, I dont like what its become. I liked it before, (except for the elevators becoming free, that was the best thing ever) where it was actually different from other games. Like I said, I love this game, and I hate to see it die like this.\n\nTL;DR (because i'll be honest, this review is frickin long) The game is fun, enjoyable, and all around a cool experience, although its taken some turns for the worst. I wouldnt want to see this game die, since it seems to be bleeding out right now. But overall I give this game a 7/10, or if nostalgia is added to the equation, 8/10. This game is a fantastic f2p, and I recommend it to anyone who is willing to try it out. Do note that the bad things kick in later in the game. You can enjoy the game starting out up til then.\nThank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy Spiral Knights.","August 6, 2015","true","167.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played back in ye olde days before the steam release. For quite a while actually. months of playtime, possibly half a year. I went through the hell that was the CANT LOG IN phase in the game, stopping me from playing for a couple of weeks, which really killed me. That event seriously injured the game, and if I remember, wasa caused by some hacking over at Sega (but dont quote me on that). This little paragraph was just a backstory to what I've been through with this game, just to let you know that I LOVE this game, or atleast used to more than I do now, so the actual review is down below...\nOne last thing, I have not played this game in over a year, but I've looked at the update logs and such, so I atleast know what's happened.\n\nAlright, the pros of this game. The gameplay itself is basic, but not mind-numbingly boring. You move around, attack, pick things up, dodge, etc. Better than most MMO's today, with all that clicking on something to blindly attack whatever bull. The art style of the game is quite nice. The soundtrack...boy, I REALLY like the soundtrack, one of my favorite things about this game. The community (in-game, why this is will be said later...) is probably one of the best things about this game. I made many in-game friends playing this game, some in particular were very nice and cool. And as I see in other reviews, Im not alone. The shop that drives the economy is the auction house, where you can put things up for crowns (currency). There are npc vendors, but I'll be honest, no one uses them, unless they have something unique.\n\nAlright, now the bad stuff, the stuff I really hate to see. In the old days of Spiral Knights, there was mist energy. It regenerated quite slowly up to a maximum of 100. Elevators in the game were used to continue on through the levels, but cost 10 energy to use. So that's basically 10 levels a day, maybe around 12 if you use it at specific times. Crystal energy is considered the premium currency in this game, since every f2p game ever has to have one. But on one fateful day, mist energy was removed, but elevators are now free to use. This was a very smart decision, I thought, except when the rest of the update was revealed. Originally, to craft things, pretty much the only way to get high tier gear, you used energy and materials dropped from enemies. You would also pick up heat for your gear, which is used to level it up and make it better. But then, they added Orbs of Alchmey and Fire Shards. Orbs weren't that awful for me, but only because the game requires you to have a certain level weapon in order to craft the next tier of weapon. With the new fire shards, you had to have a specific fire shard, and depending on the amount you used, would show a percentage that the heat level up would be succesful. So you had to have lady luck on your side unless you want to potentially waste all your crystals on one of 10 heat levels (the max). Basically, the game became a grindfest for orbs and shards (and I didnt mention that lower grade shards cant be combined to make bigger shards, but bigger shards can be smashed into smaller ones. BUT you had to have the recipe to do that, which was given to you when you completed the gear check once you had all the same tier gear. Ex: Full tier 4 gear check, you go through, you can now get tier 5 gear. You get a recipe for smashing tier 5 shards, the ones you need, for tier 4 shards, the ones you USED to need. The system is very broken, and I dont think its changed at all.)\nBefore missions, there was the arcade, a place where gateways led to branches of levels, and players could influence which levels showed up in next weeks gates. This was were you went to actually PLAY the game. That always struck me as interesting. But when the missions came out, you could just skip all those levels and go straight to the boss levels, the main reason people were going down certain gates. Sure, it saved time and wasnt as much as a pain to get there, but missions literally KILLED the arcade. I dont see anyone there anymore, even though it still exists. I just feel it takes some exploration out of the game.\nBut what about the crystals? Now they're used for feeding your pet, which you get through a line of missions. Everyone freaked out at this since every MMO must ALWAYS have pets. When they came out, you could choose a mini dragon that shoots fire, a phantom ghost that shot out caustic needles and could go invisible, and a cat. You know, just a  cat that flies around. Guess which one no one ever picked...(the cat). Thing is, once I got my pet, I used him some, leveled him up a bit, but I always forgot about him. I never used him as often as he was intended, even though when I did remember him, he did help some. Doesn't this show that we have come to not need pets? We played the game to work as a team of knights traversing through the unknown depths of an alien planet, cut off from the rest of our home. Now its more like pet simulator.\nAnd last but CERTAINLY not least, the new updates. I looked at over 30 update logs within the past year or so. All but about 2 had ACTUAL content. The rest of them were just adding limited time reskins of cosmetics, that cost money to get. This is just sad...  this isnt tf2.\n\nOk, so I sound like I dont like this game right? Well, I dont like what its become. I liked it before, (except for the elevators becoming free, that was the best thing ever) where it was actually different from other games. Like I said, I love this game, and I hate to see it die like this.\n\nTL;DR (because i'll be honest, this review is frickin long) The game is fun, enjoyable, and all around a cool experience, although its taken some turns for the worst. I wouldnt want to see this game die, since it seems to be bleeding out right now. But overall I give this game a 7/10, or if nostalgia is added to the equation, 8/10. This game is a fantastic f2p, and I recommend it to anyone who is willing to try it out. Do note that the bad things kick in later in the game. You can enjoy the game starting out up til then.\nThank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy Spiral Knights.","August 6, 2015","true","167.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story also provides a healthy amount of cutscenes if and text if you are looking for that. Missions typically involve you progressing through a dungeon littered with enemies and different types of square voxels of differing types (ex: wall voxel or explosive voxel). There are sometimes gates that require you to pick up a key (you cannot attack while carrying it) and bring it to the padlock in order to open it. You might also have to pick up a pot object and throw it at another object in order to clear obstacles, allowing for further access into a dungeon.\n\nThe combat and controls are pretty easy to become familiar with. Left click to attack, right click to use your shield. Holding the attack down allows you to charge up your weapon (a gauge will appear). You may also use the mouse wheel to alternate between weapons. There is a dash/evade mechanic you can execute by holding shift and pressing right click.\n\nThe dungeons can become fairly challenging if playing solo, however, it is still viable if you are careful and do not rush right into enemy spawns. The rewards from completing missions and item drops are reasonable. The loot automatically is attracted to your character like a magnet, so you do not need to click on dropped items.\n\nAesthetics are nice, the dungeons and enemies are decently detailed. Like many MMOs, there can be a lot of clutter in the interface, especially when you first log into the game and access the game hub - you will need to get used to this orientation if you have not played many MMOs.\n\nThe minimap can be expanded to cover the center of your screen by pressing B (do not press tab, that brings up the character stats/info panel), however, be advised that the border of the map is a bold blue, making it noticeably difficult to play while keeping the minimap expanded (compared to games like Path of Exile, or Diablo, where the minimap is translucent enough for you to see most things easily.\n\nOverall, the game seems pretty fleshed out, with quite a bit to do. Definitely recommend trying it out if you are interested and/or not already playing other MMOs  (or have the extra time to spare).\n","July 7, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact to be honest I came in here for the free hat for TF2. However! This game is basicly a child-friendly dungeon crawler that is easy in the beginning but once you get to the arcade things get real! One of my friends and I almost BOTH died on the arcade levels. Also this game has potential in my eyes. So in conclusion I give this game a 6/10.","August 21, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The core gameplay is casual but also fun and addictive. The graphics, while certainly nothing to brag about, are more than adequate to provide a smooth gaming experience while not looking too outdated. The music is both melodic and reminiscent of the good old 8bit days. There are some minor lag problems due to the games use of UDP protocols and because of the limmited server size, however, the game is still in ongoing development and there's no reason to think these issues won't be rectified in the future. All in all I'd recommend Spiral Knights to anyone and give it a 4/5 rating.","June 30, 2011","true","297.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story also provides a healthy amount of cutscenes if and text if you are looking for that. Missions typically involve you progressing through a dungeon littered with enemies and different types of square voxels of differing types (ex: wall voxel or explosive voxel). There are sometimes gates that require you to pick up a key (you cannot attack while carrying it) and bring it to the padlock in order to open it. You might also have to pick up a pot object and throw it at another object in order to clear obstacles, allowing for further access into a dungeon.\n\nThe combat and controls are pretty easy to become familiar with. Left click to attack, right click to use your shield. Holding the attack down allows you to charge up your weapon (a gauge will appear). You may also use the mouse wheel to alternate between weapons. There is a dash/evade mechanic you can execute by holding shift and pressing right click.\n\nThe dungeons can become fairly challenging if playing solo, however, it is still viable if you are careful and do not rush right into enemy spawns. The rewards from completing missions and item drops are reasonable. The loot automatically is attracted to your character like a magnet, so you do not need to click on dropped items.\n\nAesthetics are nice, the dungeons and enemies are decently detailed. Like many MMOs, there can be a lot of clutter in the interface, especially when you first log into the game and access the game hub - you will need to get used to this orientation if you have not played many MMOs.\n\nThe minimap can be expanded to cover the center of your screen by pressing B (do not press tab, that brings up the character stats/info panel), however, be advised that the border of the map is a bold blue, making it noticeably difficult to play while keeping the minimap expanded (compared to games like Path of Exile, or Diablo, where the minimap is translucent enough for you to see most things easily.\n\nOverall, the game seems pretty fleshed out, with quite a bit to do. Definitely recommend trying it out if you are interested and/or not already playing other MMOs  (or have the extra time to spare).\n","July 7, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's kept extremely simple, which makes it a great casual game that I can pick up and drop off without intense involvement. This is a good pizza-and-mouse game, meaning you can play one-handed due to the simplicity of the controls. It's a nice, calm, relaxing game, with stretches of tension and frustration. It's FtP, so there's limits on how much you can do in a 24 hour span, which kind of helps keeps me from seeing the limitations of the campaign missions. The skirmish missions are always different, but to clear a campaign, you must fight the same enemies on the same map. It has a difficulty spike in some areas. I love the visual design, and the music is an awesome combination of eight-bit and chill. Some of the collecting and trading aspects are difficult, as it isn't always easy to find someone who will buy what you want, even though it is extremely easy to buy items from others at the sub-ten tiers.  8.5/10.","April 23, 2012","true","54.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
