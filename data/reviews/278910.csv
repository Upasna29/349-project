But where the game really excells, is in the multiplayer.\nPlay with at least three people and watch the chaos unfold. Pacts are made, truces broken and backs are stabbed.\n\nThe only recommendations i would make to the developers:\n- Add more research; the skill tree is largely resource boosters. Perhaps some more unlockable buildings or weapons?\n- Different difficulties for AI\n- The ability to set teams before launching a game\n- More variety in buildings would be nice too, and perhaps the option to upgrade/specialize a city\n\nThe points mentioned are not essential to have in this game! All of them would, however, make the game better (in my opinion).\n\nConclusion:\n\n8/10, this game has a lot of potential!\n","December 23, 2014","true","14.5"," 108 of 112 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","108","112","5","0"

Granted, that was on sale when it was in beta, so it's increased to 15, with a good sale going probably from 10-12, but the game is still a very good, if not an amazing buy.\n\nPros (As of May 13, 2015. Initial release):\n\n+No issues with large lobbies anymore. Large lobbies are supported and quite awesome.\n\n+Cool graphics. You can see every shot with very little FPS drop.\n\n+From what my friends and I have tried and tested, the game seems decently balanced, from early rushes to late game turtle.\n\n+Full, 26 piece tech tree that ensures that you can't simply rush in one direction without feeling the loss in other sectors. For example, if you singlemindedly rush lasers, you won't be able to build any defenses to counter the railguns that someone else built for half the cost and time.\n\n+n-body physics on the main game map. Now I get it, a game about firing weapons through outer space better have a good physics engine, but this game is just awesome. Every massive (e.g. not weapons) body in the game exerts a force on projectiles, to the point where a gas giant that's behind your planet will mess up your firing arcs pointing in front of you. It can be frustrating, but its the best part and main attraction of the game.\n\n+Non-instantaneous projectiles mean that you have to do some aiming at your target rather than just pointing your guns at them.\n\n+Different level AI. Given that I haven't tried too many of them out, but still they offer training before you hit the scary players out there.\n\n+Intuitive building mechanics. Everything makes sense pretty much instantly. You have two resources, balance them.\n\n+Customizable lobbies. No more are games confined to 5 cities and 100000 minerals, but these are now modifiable for custom gaming. These, along with other things (like what weapons can be built, what size planets are, etc.), are nearly fully variable! This includes making games private so that only your friends can join.\n\n+Turn timers. This was important, because people could sit in a game, raging, and never passing their turn. That would cause the game to stall out, but now with turn timers, that happens no more! Eat it, sore losers.\n\nNeutrals:\n\nTurn timer only goes up to three minutes, which isn't enough in the late game.\n\nMusic is very good, but it is on loop and there isn't too much variety (About 8ish minutes of it, I THINK), but you can mute it and play your own in the background.\n\nOne game has a length of anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours, depending on how slow the starts are and how long it takes to get lucky with damage distributions.\n\nCons:\n\n-Has two decently sized bugs. One freezes the turn permanently if everyone in the game has passed except one. If that one person leaves the game instead of ending his turn, the game bugs out, sadly. The other is minor and easily fixable if you hit enough random buttons: the missile lock is funky. If you don't click on a target planet fast enough you screen looses its UI and you have to hit escape to go to the pause menu. When you come back, everything is fixed.\n\n-Not a huge community. Before the game was fully released (i.e. beta) there was a very small community which could barely field a few pick-up games a day. Today there were lobbies open at all times though. Seems the release has breathed new life here.\n\n-Game incorporates randomness in play affecting areas. Everyone's population and science increase at slightly different rates, meaning that you can never quite have the same opener/information on all players. On turn 10 of one game, a certain tech may be 1 turn research, where in another game it is 2 turns. Not huge, but for the hardcore people like myself, this can, in theory, hurt a few games in a hundred.\n\n-Learning curve exists. While a pro to some people due to it's depth and skill based gaming, this means that you WILL lose your first game against random players. Hopefully you will be talking in chat the whole way with more experienced players who can teach you the ropes, but maybe not.\n\n-Slight runaway leader scenario. The player with the better economy on turn ten will also have a better econ on turn 20, and 30 and 40... If you try and build a ton of railguns or lasers to hit the guy who is shooting you every turn with 10+, you are going to lose the war. If you try and fight fire with fire, you are going to get burned. Sadly, this is the most intuitive way to go about playing, and some people might call certain strategies unbalanced as a result.\n\n-+-\nAll in all, if you like not-casual-but-not-super-competitive games about space, and/or artillery, and/or resource management, then this game could be for you. It certainly was for me. It is 100% worth the $11.99 on sale, and it's almost surely worth the $15 normal price. It's been a fun 80 hours, and I put in about 8 a week.\n(Buy this game.)\n(Do it.)","May 13, 2015","true","179.0"," 112 of 120 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","112","120","3","3"

In Interplanetary you wage war against AI or human players across an entire solar system which is randomly generated each time you play so you'll never play the same game twice.\n\nA word of warning, if you want this game purely for a singleplayer experience I'd suggest holding out on it but if you're looking for a great multiplayer strategy experience you have found it.\n\n+The graphics are quite nice and even when you zoom in very close to the planets they look great\n+Nice visual effects when enemy planets or your own planet gets hit by enemy fire\n+The game has fantastic projectile physics but I'll come back to physics later\n+Thanks to the turn-based nature of the game you can really take your time with choosing what to build and where to attack to maximise your power\n+Despite the tutorial being several intimidating pages of text explaining core mechanics this game is relatively simple to understand and once you have a basic understanding of it you'll quickly improve and figure out how everything works\n+Buildings can be upgraded to improve them in a way which suits the building, for example extra damage for railguns, and each building can only have two upgrades which prevents AI and players alike from developing overpowered buildings\n+The resource management is very simple in Interplanetary and there are only two resources in the game so you often have to make simple but difficult decisions regarding what to build next\n+Trying to figure out the right trajectory for your attacks is incredibly challenging but also a whole load of fun though I did feel that it was too difficult at times especially when firing across the solar system with other planets in your way as the game gives you no indication of their speed so you have to guess where they'll be to avoid entering their gravitational fields\n+Even at this relatively early stage in development the tech tree is already quite good and it contains boosts to material, power etc. as well as the expected unlockable buildings\n+Even just loading up an empty game and shooting at nearby planets is fun\n+Good variety of weapons\n+The game's calculations take place impressively quickly\n\n-AI are overpowered and have no levels of difficulty. In my time playing this against AI I never once saw them miss a shot and as far as I can tell they also build much faster than you can, as I was struggling to build a second weapon I was already being bombarded by three weapons\n-Of course it is in Early Access and allowances should be made but it isn't overly realistic. First off not all of the planets orbit in the same direction. Secondly, and this is me perhaps being a little too critical, the type of planets you'll find in a solar system often don't match what should be found where they are orbiting, for example Earth-like planets orbiting very close to suns and barren Mars-like planets in outer orbits towards the edge of the solar system\n-There aren't many people playing this game so if you don't have friends who own it or you can't play local multiplayer you might struggle to find any matches\n-The defensive buildings in the game are almost entirely useless, particularly against AI\n-You can't save your progress\n\nWorth a mention:\n-The predicted paths that the game provides when you are choosing trajectories become entirely incorrect as soon as your weapon fires\n\nVerdict:\n8\n\nDespite the lack of a good AI this game is a fantastic strategy game and can be enjoyed in more than just the usual ways, I'd strongly recommend getting this to play with friends.\n\nEl K.","March 30, 2015","true","5.9"," 74 of 95 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","74","95","5","5"

War never changes.\n\nStrap in and put on your helmet, soldier, 'cause Irreverend Opinions is taking a shot at Interplanetary!\n\n---\n\nThe Blurb\nInterplanetary is a three-dimensional artillery tactical game of war between planets.  Players (or AI) control a planet, directing research and construction, and then aiming various cannons, missiles, lasers, and superweapons at their opposing cities and infrastructure, having to work around the gravitational pull and orbital drift of their opponents.\n\nThe Good\nThe simplicity that Interplanetary depicts their controls cannot be overstated.   The various screens give you access to all that you need at that level; construction shows you what you can build (and whether you can afford it), weapons show you 'targeting lines' to display what the expected shot path is, according to gravity and such.\n\nNo number-crunching beyond "do I have enough power to shoot this laser" is needed, and even then, graphical displays demonstrate things for you.\n\nFor a Unity-based game, the physics engine incorporated by Interplanetary is robust and bug-free.  Kinetic shots follow paths dictated by velocity and planetary mass, meaning you have to factor these into the shot like a space-age game of 8-ball.\n\nIntelligencia is a factor in the game, expressed as simplified "intel" and "counterintel" pointers that require their own individual building types to generate.  Simply enough, higher intel than enemy counterintel means you can see their buildings and cities, and you cannot see their constructions if they have higher counterintel than your intel.\n\nThe tech tree is likewise streamlined, giving some small room for options in early to middle game, focusing on kinetic weapons (railguns with biological weapon warheads, for example) or lasers, etc.\n\nMultiplayer is both easy to set up (hotseat/internet) and fun.\n\nThe Bad\nLate game tech is homogenous, meaning that choices break down in importance fairly soon.  It's possible to research everything in the tree, with no exclusive tech lockouts or cultural 'themes'.\n\nIntel/counterintel generates quickly, making the midgame as much of a 'cookie cutter' scenario for tech development and building.  Doing otherwise leaves you defenseless to precision strikes, or firing blindly at a planet in the hopes of breaking something important.\n\nBy that same problem, given that midgame tech development must be followed in certain patterns, early game requires specific development and tech, eliminating much of the 'individuality' allowed.\n\nThe Ugly\nNot really anything, though Interplanetary does not apparently function on Windows 10 systems.\n\nSuggestions\nPlayers are encouraged to stagger weapons tech development with intelligence and defensive tech capacities, and largely ignore utility techs until lategame.  The same requirement largely exists in construction; weapons, (counter-)intel, and then spamming utility in order to fund construction of your superweapons.  Once you have enough weapons to survive, simply focus on intelligence.  If you focus hard on counterintelligence, the AI will largely ignore you entirely, meaning that in VS AI matches, you can largely skip defensive techs until later in the game as well.\n\nFor developers; the recommendation is to make the tech tree one of individual flavor, rather than railroad paths.  Spread some of the various tech benefits (city growth, chosen weapon potency, energy generation, etc) through each 'branch', and then focus the 'branch' on a particular playstyle (widespread bombardment, precision strikes).  Slow science generation enough that choices are meaningful, and the "science victory" achievement is actually one that takes effort to receive.  Perhaps some effects in the kinetics tree to show variation expected thanks to gravity and orbit (cone trajectory, rather than a line).\n\nThe Summary\nDefinitely playable, Interplanetary is a fun artillery game for players who don't want to micromanage or focus on number crunching.  7/10.\n\n---\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","September 27, 2015","true","10.0"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","41","49","6","0"

It can be difficult for newer players because you have to allocate your resources wisely and have to take into account planet movement, spin and gravitational effects when firing a weapon.  Also, you have to choose when it is the correct time to go on a complete offensive and give the enemy hell, or hold back and build buildings that generate power, minerals, intelligence and/or counter intelligence.\nA few of the many reasons I like this game is because it took only 13 minutes to download, and I have a down speed of 2.4 mb/s on a good day.  Equally, the game is well-balanced and I have not yet encountered any bugs or performance issues.\n\nI must say, upgrading your buildings and cities, whilst handy, does not seem to give you much of an advantage.  It appears that building more weapons can be more effective than improving existing ones.  I would, therefore, say that this is something the developers would want to take into account, in the future.\nAs well as this, I do not like the fact that each player can only control one planet.  Admittedly, if this were a feature, it would be rather OP, however I do still feel a little disappointed that you and the AI are restricted to one planet.\n\nOverall, This is certainly a four-star game, if not five-star.  I am greatly impressed and pleased that, although I am still playing on easy, it did not take me long to get the hang of the game.  I would certainly recommend this game to anyone interested in turn-based, strategy and multiplayer games.","May 16, 2015","true","14.3"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","0"

The only way to reliably get hits is to let your attacks fall into the target's gravity well. There's zero room for interesting maneuvers because you can't see or reliably guess where the future positions of the planets will be, and you can't adjust any its trajectory mid-flight.\n\nLasers trump everything. The only thing balancing it is that it has a small radius and that you need to have intel to really make use of it, but intel/counterintel is just a resource sink, i.e. can I build Telescope Arrays faster than the enemy builds Data Security Hubs?\n\nStrategy-wise this game sucks, especially if you have more than two players. The innermost and outermost players inherently have a strategic advantage compared to the ones in the middle because there are fewer attack approaches. City placement is random and it's much better to have cities that are relatively closer for shielding purposes.\n\nIt's not in your best interest to shoot first because that draws away energy that could be used for defense/construction. Since you can't loot enemies for resources, the only strategic advantage that you get from it is that you remove a threat, which quickly dwindles to nothing the more players there are. Thus it favors defensive strategies over offensive ones, i.e. just keep building until you strip the planet dry before making a move. Also, a 3+ player free-for-all becomes a Mexican standoff, which disincentivizes attacking even further.\n\nHonestly the game is just a one-trick pony that actually kinda fails on its selling gimmick. The physics simulation in the game is ridiculously simplified: it's all in the 2D plane and it's no more complicated than eyeballing it. Approach vectors don't matter; the only thing the game cares about is that the shot connects. Which makes no sense for, well, a freaking railgun whose projectiles are governed by orbital mechanics. For instance, tripling the impact velocity should increase the damage by roughly an order of magnitude, which would also be nice because it would reward more difficult (i.e. moving, not falling) shots.\n\nAlso, the interface is clunky but at least that can be fixed.","December 30, 2015","false","5.3"," 50 of 77 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","50","77","4","0"

I'd expect this in a pre-alpha, but for $15?  Really?  I feel like a Kickstarter idiot lately as the amount of half-baked not ready for release games lately is amazing.\n\nYou know it's about to crash when the interface starts glitching.  But then the save function usually doesn't work.  I guess I could save religiously every ten turns or so, but when playing vs other players?  "sorry - have to save" - Give me a few minutes and re-join...\n\n2: The cheating AI aside, the interface is atrocious.  You want to be able to plan ahead, but there is no overlay to see your positions on your planet from a distance ( ie - red dots as it rotates), so you are never sure if your planet will rotate enough to get a shot off the next turn.  Also, when you are going to take damage, you don't SEE it hit.  Most of the fun in these types of games is seeing the shot and what it damages in real time.  You might as well skip the animation in this one - fire, come back, zoom into your planet to see what was hit.\n\nIn a typical artillery type of game, you can see your shots, where they flew, and how to adjust to hit the enemy.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the cities are the most hidden/first to be made not visible items???  And if the enemy has enough stealth, you simply forget their location?  You can't even remember what you saw last turn?\n\n3: Playing with the AI is useless unless you turtle for 40 turns or just build 10-20 ( not joking ) railguns and idiot-spam them.\n\nPVP:\nNow, it is good playing hotseat, which is fun, but the time required to do so is hugely prohibitive.  The issue is that playing versus humans nets a 3-4 hour stalemate due to the only way to really do damage are superweapons.  If they make a grid of defenses over each city, and start building some stealth, you're going to waste the next few hours doing nothing. (ie - turn 40+)  Your railguns are not aimable, your missiles can't get through the kinetic defenses ( can't aim them unless you have a visual target), and lasers are the only thing that can consistently hit cities.  Until they get laser shielding.  Maybe you get lucky and take out one city with railgun spamming, but it takes all five dead to win.  You can take out a few things, but the cities are the only thing that matters.  Once those have 2-3 defenses on top of them, you're into the endgame:\n\nA: lob an asteroid and hope it hits something useful and critical/not fixable as it's random.\nB: Fire your one super laser and take out a single building or damage part of a city.\nC: wish the interface would stop forcing you to do your research queue when all you want to do is fire and get on to the next round.\n\nAs it is, my son and I have played for 4 hours and still not finished a game before it crashed one of our two systems.\nTwo copies, $30 wasted.

This sounds easy enough but you'll find that when you need to shoot your opponents, your railgun will be facing the other direction due to your planet's rotation. Your lasers don't hit anything but air and empty soil because your opponent has worked on counterinteligence, and your missiles were brought off course by the gravity well of a passing gas giant. He takes the shot, but misses you just barely. And the gravity well of your planet redirects those railgun shots right into the orbit of a third player.\n\nI did not expect it, but it is surprisingly challenging in your tactical and strategic choices. Do you build everything nearby so the early game railguns will do barely any damage at all, with everything you have fitting nicely under one defence structure... or do you spread out everything so a superweapon can't hit everything at the same time and destroy half your buildings with one well placed shot? Who do you aim at first? That guy who keeps shooting railguns at you and is obviously out for blood, or the guy who is peacefully building his war machine with mines and data security centers? The list goes on, but it has more than enough variety to allow for plenty of experimenting while it avoids having a single strategy that will always come out as the best.\n\nIt is certainly worth giving a try, with plenty of decisions and choices to keep you thinking, but fast paced enough to get through a game without spending your whole day on it.

It's less intense than defcon, but still very action packed. There is that early game build up of structures, but there is always that worry that someone will strike first against you. Hitting with your railgun and missiles comes down to a brutal physics  and sometime luck as you guess the right trajegtory. Honestly, I've played only a few hours and I think it's great. There is loads of potential here for the developer to add onto. Beware though it is an alpha. There are many things that need balancing and tweaking. The tutorial doesn't make everything abundantly obvious. The tech tree is short and the is no reminder to pick a tech. It's is still at heart and concept wise a good game. If its on sale definanetly grab this game, if its not on sale eeeehhh meh. It might be worth 10 bucks, but in its current state waiting until it goes on sale or into beta is the best bet.","April 20, 2014","true","12.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

However, the slow pace and "early acess-ness" of this game may turn some off.\n\nPros:\n- Something about it makes it reeeeally hard to turn off the game, even when you realize you've been playing for a million years straight.\n\n- The general in-depth "ness" of the game. It aint your average artillery game.\n\n- The developers won't try to screw you over *cough* EA *cough*\n\nCons:\n- Finding a group to play with on multiplayer is kinda hard. (Most games seem to pop up at 3:00 PM PST)\n\n- WiFi issues. While they aren't as bad as when the game came out (or so I heard), if you have a big game (try to limit your game size to 3), there WILL be issues.\n\n- The slow pace may turn some off.\n\n\nI'm a bit on the fence about the save feature; your planet has a limited amount of resources, meaning all games will eventually and enivitably end; a save feature would be nice, as these games can litrerally last forever.\n\nBut don't let any of the cons turn you down, the devs are hard at work making a singleplayer mode, stable WiFi connections for bigger games, and a save feature. And if the devs keep this up, the first con - the community being small - will go away, the community will get bigger.\n\nAnd I can certainly recommend this to anyone, given they don't hate slow games.

The control scheme is well-integrated into the game, making it very playable with minimal game knowledge; it also has a very high replayability factor, since the nature of the simulation ensures that no two games are the same. All in all, well worth the purchase price.\n\nHowever, the game is not without room for improvement: I do think putting connection and upgrade trackers on the top-screen city bar would be a pretty nice addition. Also, the game assumes zero deviation from the ecliptic, meaning that all the planets -- and other objects -- in the system orbit and move otherwise in a single two-dimentional plane, neither "rising above" nor "falling below" the average orbital plane. The game assumes perfectly circular orbits, too. I'd love to see this kind of thing with some deviated orbits, like a real star system.

There are a few key problems that keep me from doing so. Primarily the balance of weapons and defences is very far off. When your planet is hit with a railgun round, the round splits in atmo into 5 or so chunks that cause quite a bit of damage. Your kinetic defences that you've hopefully deployed cover a very small area... and guess what, railgun rounds have a large area of effect, so when a round hits even just outside of your defences, it causes damage everywhere. If you possess the power to hurtle cannon rounds across your solar system, you should have the ability to build defences that cover a much larger area of your planet. Another smaller issue I have is that when going up against more than one AI player, they are practically unbeatable. They build faster, and are far more accurate than you will ever be.\n\nTLDR: kinetic defences are almost useless, and shouldn't be. And the AI is very powerful.

Hoping to see more great things added to it. If you've ever played any of the Worms games, or any tank battle turn based game, this game takes it to a new level. Build your interplanetary defenses and weapons and unlease a volley of attacks on other planets. Sounds easy, until you realize the red targeting line isn't going to take into account planetary movement and the influence of the gravitational pull of the other planets moving in the solar system. Takes a bit of though, but of gut calculation, and a bit of luck at times to really hit your enemies home with your weapons.\n\nPros:\n- Awesome concept executed well\n- Resource management is simple, yet forces decision making. Do I want more new weapons or defenses next turn, or do I want to attempt to do more damage now?\n\nHopes:\n- I hope you'll be able to designate names for your missiles, because if you have half a dozen, but did specific upgrades to some and not others, it's hard to figure out which missile has the upgrades.

And I do mean absolutely brilliant.\n\nIt's not often a game comes along that both manages to be incredibly simple and yet so magnificently complex. And that's the true beauty of Interplanetary.\n\nDespite being a strategy game, despite having tech trees and build units and economy etc. Interplanetary, threw virtue of an intuitive interface, tooltips that tell you exactly what you need to know, and combat that centres around a simple yet unique mechanic, manages to be a game anyone could pick up and within minutes understand everything they need to know in order to enjoy playing.\n\nWhat is that central mechanic you might ask? Well to put it simply, gravity. Interplanetary is a game were you construct weapons, defences, and resource buildings in order to fling tiny little projectiles of mass destruction. During each turn you lock in your trajectories, cross your fingers, and watch as your planets death balls of destruction fly across the screen. "Did you guess the orbits properly? Will that planets gravity be enough to align the shot? What if the turn accelerates the missile too fast?" These questions and more will be ricocheting across your head as you cross your fingers and pray your little shots hit. And the ones coming towards you don't.\n\nAnd that's just what's so wonderful about interplanetary. Even with such simplistic gameplay it will have you on the edge of your seat nervously waiting between each and every turn, completely absorbed in the interactions of these little planets and their annoying to predict orbits. It lands perfectly in that "easy to learn, hard to master" spot. And stands as a game I can recommend not only to strategy lovers, or space nuts, but to anyone looking to have a good time.\n\nSeriously, if you think you might like this game, get it.

The array of weapons that you can arm your planet with is grand, be it with pinpoint accuracy lasers or homing missiles. One of the best, but most complicated parts of the combat system is the gravity of the planets and the sun.

Although FA had trade, diplomacy, ships… on top of all what Interplanetary has - and was a real time game while this one’s turn based.\n\nI really like this game. In its current state it is a very stable and well balanced product.\nIt is a small game in scale. Don’t expect too much of it. A cool game to pass time shooting up AI – and a great game to spend playing in multiplayer with few buddies and beer.\n\nEach player starts the game on his own planet. With the predefined number of cities and finite raw materials. That means you can actually run dry – or even starve the enemy.\n\nThe planets orbit around a sun, in various directions. Every turn makes the planets orbit a little bit further.\n\nYou start with very few things to build and then develop technology to build more using energy and minerals.\nBuildings like:\nMines, Power Plants, Weapons, Defenses, Intelligence Buildings, Counter Intelligence Buildings, Superweapons.\n\nYou also grow your cities by stimulating the growth rate – and with more population in the city you can assign them “city projects” which act in a similar way that building upgrades, giving you various temporary or permanent benefits – at times at a small cost in other areas.\n\nAn interesting aspect of the game is intelligence gathering and counterintelligence – which I will refer to simply as “spying” here. It’s surprisingly well implemented into the AI that really pretends to not know where exactly each and every building you have is located.\nSpying is basically that part you’d have in a battleship game where you mark down the places you hit the enemy or miss.\nThere are three main aspects to this.\nIntelligence – Is how well you know the enemy. It stacks up against his counter intelligence score to give you the result. Depending on how high the resulting score is that’s how much you can see his planet in detail. First you would see his superweapons, spying buildings and not much more. With higher score you start to uncover his weapons location, information about his economy, population, location of his mines, power plants, defenses and finally – the location of his cities, which if you know the location of, it makes you much easier to target his most vulnerable spot and ultimately win the match.\nCounterintelligence – Is basically the amount of misinformation every player puts out there with the help of special city projects and buildings. With this you are able to lower every enemy’s knowledge of you (it’s calculated globally so no need to target anyone specifically).\nEyeballing – This is what you will do yourself, mostly when facing lower number of enemy players. See, after each time you pummel the enemy planet with some ordnance – you receive helpful information of where you hit the targets – and if they were buildings or cities. With this in mind you can observe the craters and ruins you caused on his planet – to further extrapolate where to fire. You will very often feel like an artillery commander – guiding your guns to the target. And you will often be able to choose – with precise and homing weapons – where to hit. Would you rather take out the power grid, or superweapons or annihilate a city or two…\n\nWeapons fire simultaneously after every player finished his turn and aimed.\nAiming is done in the targeting view. Some weapons like rail guns simply plot an arc of fire to the enemy – which is simulated respecting the gravity. You always should lead the target when firing a kinetic weapon, unless the target is very close to you, because it takes some time for the rail shells to reach it. Other weapons like missiles not only aim at the planet – but have a second degree of targeting which involves zooming on the planet to decide where exactly to drop the payload. There are also precise weapons like lasers which require direct line of fire, are extremely accurate although have small area of blast.\n\nAiming can be tricky – but is very rewarding once you get the hang of it.\n\nThe game has two types of superweapons. One is extremely strong but imprecise – the other is very precise but not as devastating. Both pass any planetary defense. Another difference between them is that one shoots from the sun and other shoots from the outer rim. So depending on where the target is – one would be better choice than the other.\n\nThe game has a variety of strategies you can adapt. High replayability value – for how simple it actually is. Yes, I guess I should add it’s a game you could learn how to play in around 10 minutes. It’s very straightforward to get in – while hard to master.\nThe tech tree itself is one of those “no BS tech trees” where every single tech is meaningful and in the end – it’s a pretty short tech tree you will usually complete around turn 60-80.\n\nYou should also try to anticipate what will the enemy use to attack you with – spy him to get a better picture of what’s to come. For example by seeing his techs under development.\n\nI fully recommend this game. It is a solid, small-medium scale game, best played in multiplayer but also very entertaining in single.\n\nThe game has still much room for improvement.\nIt feels like it has such a potential you really start to see that there could be more – much more – content in it.\nIt feels like the perfect base game that could be greatly enhanced with DLC or an expansion.\n\nMy DLC/expansion wishlist:\n- Asteroid/Remote Planet mining after your planet runs dry of materials.\n- Ultimate Weapons, like say the ability to create sth like artificial moons or whole planets you could use as additional gun platforms.\n- The ability to build things underground. Perhaps the addition of vaults where you could gradually transfer your population to in the late game to much better protect them from bombardment.\n- Random Events.\n- Explore missions to survey uninhabited planets in the system for goodies. Letting you send missions to them – exposing them to lot of danger, but being able to reap the rewards if successful.\n- MORE Techs.\n- A small video here and there wouldn’t hurt. When you win the game, the turn just ends and it takes you directly to the scoreboard. I wish it would give more oomph. You know, these small things in games.\n\nSo yes, again, I wish that after playing the game a few times – I could play an alternative version of it, maybe mixed with PLAGUE INC concept with much bigger focus on bioweapons. The ability to have the game last longer with longer tech tree which would include more rewarding things than just the two superweapons. How about… a shield that would envelop the whole planet? That shield would make your planet very secure – but be extremely costly to maintain. And you could make it possible to be hit in just few places where the generators are.\n\nAnother idea, since so much depends on the orbit of your planets. Why not add some technologies that would let player control his orbit? Some planetary thrusters if you may. I think it would be fun. And I don’t mean to ruin the game by turning it upside down – many of the things could be optional.\n\nBottom line is, in my mind this is a solid BASE of a game which has great potential. There’s a LOT of fun in it. But in the end you do wish there was more… much more.","January 27","true","8.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I got this game in a hundle bundle, paying just a few € that would have been justified. 14,99€ is way too much.\n\nIf you find this game on sale, you can still give it a shot.\n\nYou have a decent amount of weaponry and utility available and at first, it is quite interesting to see where the projectiles travel depending on nearby planets.\n\nScrolling through the tiny tech tree, you make up your mind on what to boost first and later on just go straight for the super weapons. It's pretty straight forward, yet not always tactically very decisive or interesting. Good luck finding all the buildings for your newly gained upgrade, though.\n\nAfter a while you find yourself annoyed from needing ridiculous amounts of power plants (nuclear ones!) just for putting one extra utility building. This is not because of energy consumption, it is because of a maximum amount of links each station can host.\n\nAnother thing that gets annoying after a while is trying to make the projectiles actually shoot an angle you want since they only accept relatively small angles. You are literally moving the mouse pixel by pixel, hoping that the projectile's way shows up properly.\nClicking through lasers and missiles, you spend an enormous amount of time waiting for the constant zoom in- zoom out animations, leaving you confused on where that building was you wanted to focus.\n\nThe user-friendlyness clearly needs to be raised with proper displays of available shooting arcs, proper selection for planetary targets and maybe the option to build just one weapon and support it with clusters of ammo for less clicks and the same amount of projectiles.\nRelatively small amounts of projectiles kill your fps here which is another argument to reduce the amount of projectiles and guns and add spreading effects on impact and such.","February 14","false","10.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

Bottom line up front:  good game with a lot of potential.  It's worth a look if you dig this sort of stuff.\n\nYes, "a lot of potential" means it's not quite there yet.  Stop right there if you're thinking, "Yeah but it's early access."  Early access should entice the gamer to want more, not frustrate with a product that they won't want even when it's complete.   Even science fiction has a logic that binds it together to make it believable in its own realm.  I've pounded my adversary round after round only for the AI to win and destroy all my cities in the last round.  This looks like an inadvertent cop-out from the designers that should be addressed.  The OM/physics needs work.  I've done OM related work before...we're familiar with heavenly bodies and gravitational fields.  The projected trajectory is a cool concept but we can predict with great accuracy where an object will go.  A civilization that can launch stuff as easily into orbit surely would have better OM capabilities as well (not eyeball it).  I get that the trajectory aiming is part of the game, but when my shots go awry...it doesn't give this player the "hmm I didn't think of that."  A few of my shots very closely mimicked the AI's trajectory.  The AI ended perfectly on target while mine was influenced by a mysterious force (note inadvertent cop-out statement).  IMHO, the game play needs more polishing to reach the "intuitive controls" level.  They aren't hard figure out, but there's no good explanation as to what does what and why it does it.  For example, there's no clear reason as to choose certain research projects in the tech tree.  Do they make a worthwhile difference?  How will the designers show this to the players in the upgrades to come?\n\nI'm content with this purchase.  But I'm an easy guy to please.  And if I'm merely content, I'm quite certain the majority of players are expecting that the "best of Interplanetary is yet to come."  I for one will be expecting that as well.

But there are some major problems:\n\n- Most of the player's time is spent doing tedious and annoying things that feel like chores. Iterating through every single building one by one to apply an upgrade, or painstakingly aiming every single missile one by one through a series of twists and turns across the solar system... only to have them all miss the target. Even navigating through the different views sucks up time, because you have to wait for the camera to finish spazzing out every single time.\n\n- Secondly, there aren't a lot of meaningful choices for the player to make. There's no real incentive to focus on offense, which makes the game drag on for even longer.  A lot of the items in the tech tree are pointless, the same goes for a lot of projects. Play one game, or at the very most two, and you'll see how a large portion of the game can mostly be ignored. There are too many tiny, meaningless details that take up time I'd like to spend strategizing.\n\nThe game was interesting for a couple of playthroughs.

Game is unbalanced, and kinetic weapons are really hard to aim/use. You pretty much exclusively use lasers. As a result, the first thing you go for is laser tech and after that you basically always win. Once you have shields no one can touch you until they develop super weapons. After that if you don't have super weapons of your own, it's too late for you.\n\nOverall, still a fun game to play, even with some significant game imbalances and very stupid AI.\n7.5/10","January 6","true","20.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

At first it is a lot of fun. Establishing the industry on your planet, placing your weapons and defence, placing the oberservation and stealth building, finding a way between firing weapons and having enough resources to defend our planted. It is also great to find the best way to attack another planet especially when it is far away. I was always very happy when I hit a planet on the other side the solar system.\n\nHowever, there are two big problems in this game:\n- So far, you can not rebuild a city (or at least I don't know how). If you lose a city, it is gone. The problem is that if someone has a lucky strike (close to your planet, game stops his planet on the right side), he can wipe our some or all of our cities very early in the game. This means that you lose a lot of resources which creates the second problem...\n- Superweapons! they are awesome, they look great but they are also overpowered (my opinion). If you are not getting attacked by other players (lucky you) and can rush trough the research you can build yourself a fortress and wipe out the other players in a few turns especially if he is good in using them.\n\nSo, is it a good game?\nYes, if you like these kind of games and if you accept its design flaws.\nNo, if you expect more options and if you want it perfectly balanced.","August 12, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No? Well apparently these guys did and it's awesome.\n\nThis game is like DEFCON except if M.A.D. wasn't a thing but instead people had no idea how to actually hit each other nor what to actually hit in the first place. You be launching giant, hypervelocity masses towards the enemy planet only for it to fly way off course and hit the next planet over, or be blocked by a giant planet between you and the enemy planet, or slingshot around the sun, and miss your own planet by inches. Its equivalent to launching nukes to Russia only for it to hit South America instead, and getting one nuke to hit the targeted country out of the hundreds you launched, not even being sure if you hit anything remotely important.\n\nYou also have to manage the resources just to fire said giant, hypervelocity masses, and build and research other weapons with their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nCould definitely use a better interface but at the same time could be much worse, and being it's early access it's probably on the radar.\n\nIf you liked DEFCON it's a definite buy.","June 25, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you have ever been at the least bit interested in projectile motion. This game's physics are highly dynamic, yet it simplifies the mathematics into an understandable visual representation as it incorporates planetary orbits (albeit circular) which you must fire your projectiles from and to, as well as the velocities of your projectiles and the gravity and its effect of each passing planet on your projectiles. **You have to do some forward thinking however as the planets are stationary when you are planning your bombardments but will continue in their orbits as the Action Phase commences adding many near hits and misses and moments of "Ooooo it is going to hit!!!!" followed by "WHAT THE @#$%?!? IT WAS SO CLOSE**\n\n2. If you enjoy sci-fi wars' of worlds. Colorfully and beautifully rendered solar systems that you get to destroy with projectiles, missiles, lasers (not on the heads of sea-bass), and even tamed asteroids...\n\n3. If you enjoy strategy games, whether playing solo versus the AI (settings range from newb to Einstein in their ability to predict the motions), or with and against other sentient beings you wish to annihilate. Even though the tech tree may not be as expansive as a Civilization game, Interplanetary allows for differing strategies from the start of each game. Do you hide and turtle up for the late game, or build quickly and start bombarding immediately, or somewhere in between? In a manner that is not overwhelming, there are resources to be managed and intelligence to be gathered and countered that all factor in to establishing your strategy for planetary destruction.\n\n4. If you remember the days when developers were of the PEOPLE and want to encourage future development of games uninhibited by corporate driven profit ideologies! Unlike most games today released for an exuberant price followed by further skin systems and nonsense that requires further pocket diving, Jolly Roger gives a game from the days of old. ***JOLLY ROGER PROVIDES AND ENCOURAGES (if you are comfortable in doing so) BASIC TOOLS FOR MODDING*** I have played the game less than a day but already looked at the potential for tweaking the game play and appreciate the ability to do so as it allows for future potential of varying game types and experiences.\n\nOverall, this game might not be completely polished in its UI or spell checking, but I do give it 5/5 for what Jolly Roger gives you in Interplanetary's bang for its buck. I highly recommend it to you and your friends to play together and believe you will find yourselves addicted once you get past the initial learning curve (which isn't that steep and can be passed after your first game).\n\n","May 14, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a turn-based strategy game with two phases. The first phase consists of a research and development turn during which players select technologies, build infrastructure, and place buildings on their planet. The second phase consists of players' weapon systems firing, and their trajectory estimates playing out. Each player controls the trajectory of their weapons which are acted upon by the gravity of celestial bodies within the solar system. The time period seems to be set in the near future, and the technology available reflects this appropriately. The single goal of this game is to enact planetary genocide against your rivals.\n\nThe game feels somewhat like a match of Risk, in space, and with some basic grand-strategy elements, and ballistic physics.  Like Risk, players can expect to spend about one to five hours per game.  And like Risk, the game can get quite addictive, especially considering that it provides online multiplayer as well as local hotseat.  Hotseat allows multiple players to play the same game on the same pc together, and is an extremely underrated feature which is often left out of turn-based strategy games.\n\nThere are a few things that I believe would add to the game.  For instance, the ability to colonize or conquer planets within the solar system, an “upgrade all” feature for buildings, the ability to name your planets and cities, and basic social, diplomatic, and political policies could add a great level of depth and immersion.\n\nNevertheless, the gameplay is inviting.  Interplantary does not try to be something it is not. It remains simple enough to pick up and quickly get the hang of, short enough to play casually, and immersive enough to allow the imagination some stomping grounds. Overall, this game is definitely worth the asking price, especially if you like to have a few friends over for an afternoon of casual strategy and camaraderie. On sale for under $5, this title would be a steal in a steam-sale splurge.","May 13, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You build various weapons, power plants and defense grids on your planet, research tech, and sling missiles and railgun rounds at neighboring planets in an attempt to wipe out the competition. I tend to favor massive defense grids, which require huge amounts of energy, so I usually beeline for kinetic defense followed by nuclear power research. Then I build as many nuclear power plants and mines as my planet will hold and squeeze a lot of guns in throughout the network. My entire planet is secure, and I can safely fire at enemies. Others will take a more offensive apporach, immediately speccing into the weapons tree, and beeline for railgun and missile upgrades with intel mixed in to hammer foes into submission before they can even get off the ground. Both strategies have merit. But watch out for the superweapons! If you're taking an offensive approach, make sure you have the energy required to fire them. If taking a defensive approach, best to just build up massive amounts of counterintelligence (so people can't see structures on your planet)... because nothing can actually defend against a superweapon. Thankfully the last update let you place gamewide limits on how many of these can be build on both sides.","July 17, 2015","true","66.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Game is about flinging projectiles through space to eliminate the population of enemy planets. Certain weapons are highly effected by gravity and require planning out trajectories. Its a fun concept but after spending some time its hard to look past the games numerous flaws.\n\n-Game is incredibly simplistic. Only 4 weapons, two effected by gravity, 2 not. Little variety in buildings. Simple yet unbalanced tech tree.\n-Position in a solar system is very important and unbalanced. If you start a game not on the outside just restart. In the middle you will be a common easy target, in the center you will be unable to take accurate shots at those on the outside.\n-Lasers are very effective because of their precision but you spend a LOT of time aiming them as you have to do it individually\n-AI plays very obnoxiously\n-Big frame rate drops in the simulation phase late game\n-Poor soundtrack that doesn't go at all with the space theme\n\nCould be a good game with a lot more time and effort but just comes off as frustrating and unsatisfying.\n","January 11","false","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I grabed it during a Sale and bought the 4pack, shared it among my friends and we soon started Annihilating each other. I try to keep it simple and compact.\n\nThe Graphics:\nNothing superb but not bad either. It does the job. There isnt much to show basicly. A few planets, a skybox, the Sun and then the few effects for shooting and hitting each other.\n\nStory:\nNot there. There is no Campaign or whatsoever. You can play vs the AI if you like but its kindah like the Worms AI. Not much fun imho. Stick to the Multiplayer and you´ll have some fun while shouting at each other.\n\nGameplay:\nVery minimalistic basicly. You start with a planet with 5 cities, you then start building a couple of Mines and Powerplants. Then build teh guns and shoot at each other. If all of your cities are destroyed, you´re done for.\nYou got some dumb projectiles that randomly disdributes the Hits on the planet and ofc, you got some Smart weapons like missiles where you set the Impact point on the Planet. Not to forget the Lasers, wich are somewhat super accurat but only can hit the side of the planet that is Facing to you.\n\nThe Balance:\nAs far as I´m aware, there wasnt a Single balance update since launch, only a few stability patches that where desperatly needed at Launch, but thats got nothing to do with the Balance.\nSome weapons feel Overpowered. In "our" first few rounds Laser became quickly popular, since they dont got a balistic flight. They hit instant in a straight line. Ofc there is a soft counter, to name them Shields, but if you aim them clever you can work around them. Same for basicly all Defensesystems. You only got a few weapons to choose from:\n-railgun, basic balistic gun\n-Missiles, advanced balistic weapon\n-Lasers, point and click weapon\nAnd the 2 "superweapons"\n-Solarlaser, wich is basicly a Ray that is fired from the sun, not from your Planet and 1 hits basicly everything\n-Asteroid Diversion, a Load of clusterf*ck aimed at your opponents... and somethings coming back to you\n\nSo, including the superweapons you only got 5 different Weapons wich lets room for improvement. And since the Laserweapons are point and click, they are pretty much the strongest. Our group Disables them in most of our Games, because of Obvious Reasons.\nThis game features a Techtree that is quite big but nonetheless allmost useless. We tried different tactics but straight rushing the Superweapons and going for Ecoboost tech afterwards, seems like the only competive way to play.\n\n\nSummit:\nI really enjoyed the Game so far BUT there are quite some things I would like to see adressed since the games is a bit expensive with 17€ without any discounts.\nThe games doesnt feature an Observer Mode, wich means if you play with like 4-5 of your Bud´s and you´re out first, you sit there and wait for them to Finish since you cant watch them anymore.\nThe tech and weapons needs rebalance, nothing big but little adjustments would be lovely. Like increasing the needed Techpower get the Superweapons. Be aware that the Game runs fine but still gets Server timeout errors once in a While. Around every 10th game or so.\n\n\nDo I recommend it?\nYes, if you got some Friends to play it with and if it is on Sale.\nThanks for Reading.","July 8, 2015","true","21.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And the idea behind this is superb: Fire long range missiles (an other stuff) at another planet in your galaxy - AWESOME!!\n\nHowever this game suffers in its current state from a severe interuption of flow and imersion.

Interplanetary is a multiplayer turn-based strategy game which is about building up your own planet with cities, and trying to destroy your enemy.\nThe game takes place in a single solar system with two civilized planets that are basically trying to destroy one another. On your own planet you can build cities with power plants and mines to collect resources. You can build defenses to shoot down an enemy incoming missile or a shield over your city to protect it. Also you can build weapons which shoot missiles or lasers to destroy the cities of your enemy. But beware! Have you ever heard of gravity? I bet you do, well you and your enemy are not the only planets floating around in this solar system. All planets have gravity, and it's your job to line up your shots correctly with the influence of gravity to hit your target. Well, these were just the basics...\n\nI like this game alot because the concept is so unique, i've never seen a game like this. Unfortunately there are not so many people online. So I reccomend buying this game with a friend so you can play together.\nHave fun in your own solar system.

If you're not paying attention, you can actually shoot yourself. Developing the infrastructure is quite neat and - while intuitive - still leaves enough room for error if you don't do the tutorial (ie. thinking that cities already HAVE power, to supply nearby devices).\n\nOverall, in the first hour of play with a single friend, we determined that this game would be nuckin' futz with 4, 6, or more players. Ideally, being able to do an 8 or 9 player game (9, in honor of our own solar system) would make for complete and total chaos in the firing phase of things.","November 3, 2014","true","11.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The server lobby is often empty and hosting a game takes quite a while most times as you wait for players to join.\n\nWith that being said, if you don't mind waiting 10 minutes or so to fill an online game lobby, or you simply want to play LAN with a friend or family member, I think it's a really enjoyable experience all round with a very solid feel to the game.\n\nYour goal is to develop your planet in a relatively simple sense, then stick some guns onto it and take aim at your opponent's planets. It sounds easy, but considoring gravity pulls on all weapons, aiming can be very tricky at long ranges until you get the hang of it! But it's not a frustrating kind of tricky, it's the kind that makes you shout "YEEEEAH!!!! WOO!" when you get a hit and read the damage report.\n\nThe game is turn based.\n\nGraphically this game is pretty sexy looking with a simple UI and good quality chat window.\n\nThe community, atleast when you find other members of it, seem really great. A playful, fun loving and intelligent bunch from my experience so far.\n\nFor the price, Interplanetary is well worth it (£4.99 at the time of writing this reviewm however don't expect to see thousands of players online waiting for a game and if you're not into using your head and patience as you game, it probably isn't for you, otherwise space and RTS fans alike will love this little gem :)\n\nThanks for reading!","June 22, 2014","true","1.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's more that it should be fine on a piece of crap too.\nReally, really, really long loading times for under-spec-but-still-capable-of-playing computers(On the level of 5-10 minutes.).\nThe system requirements are ridiculously demanding for what the game is. I'd expect something like this to run fine on an early Pentium with a VooDoo 2. (It is not impressive visually, nor is it doing especially demanding calculations to my knowledge.)\nSeriously, if an older machine can comfortably run something like Supreme Commander or Mass Effect, it should laugh at Interplanetary.

Late game Civ5 cycles faster than this.  I now regret buying it because frankly the plodding gameplay is boring me on to other things.  For that reason I can't recommend it.

I bought it earlier and I am having so much fun with the game. This game reminds me of a FTL, KSP crossover, bully me for what you will, this is the kind of vibe I'm getting from it. The system in which you do the technological upgrades could be improved, as some take two turns to research which slows down the game but does add to the suspense to the game, which I love. Overall great game, guaranteed to be playing it more often.","May 13, 2015","true","4.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There is no urgent need for a story mode, a campaign, nothing like that, but the absence of an AI to play against limits the game enjoyability, as you are forced to find people to play against, which is not everybody's cup of tea.\n\nThis is not the case as with unfinished, half-developed games, a sad constant nowadays. In fact, the game is very well though of and it plays well - and what is best, it is a refreshing novelty in strategy games, with its unique concept. The problem is not being able to play it!!! (unless someone is willing to do it with you). If the developers manage to include an AI to allow singleplay mode, this game will really shine.","August 5, 2014","true","0.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I have never seen a multiplanet game that required trajectory planning to hit your target.\n\nCons:\n\nThat trajectory planning has no real way of calculating it, it's entirely by eye. This, combined with the wonky camera system, and the difficulty that makes to see the entire solar system at once makes it 20% skill, 80% luck, especially in a timed-term game.\n\nYou experience everything the game has to offer in 20 minutes of playing, very few structures, no units,\n\n4 weapon types: Laser, Rail, Missile, and asteroid. The difference between the 4? Just about nothing. 1 set is countered by kinetic defense, 1 by shield. woo..\n\nThe forced-spinning during the 'Simulation round" will make you sick.\n\nAnd all I listed above, is the entire extent of the game.

Been playing solo against the AI and having an okay time. Took a bit of learning to get things right so there is a bit of a learning curve to this game. I'd try and play with friends if you can or, if you like waiting a bit, try and play an online match.\n\n\nYou build weapons, shoot at other planets and try and destroy them. Each turn you can build a weapon or some resource item, if you have the materials and energy, then pick a talent before targeting your weapons to the other planets. Do read the tutorial it's very helpful and without it, I think I'd been lost.\n\nI can say this game is worth getting but only if it's on sale for 50% or more. In my mind, what they're charging for this game isn't worth it unless you're a die-hard of the Turn-based and want it for your collection of gems. I got this game almost a year ago and forgot about it after an IndieGala sale. When I saw it come out of EA I thought 'well where did this game come from, lets give it a shot' and so I did.

Aiming is pretty weak. They show you the theoretical path of your projectile but for some reason the projectile doesn't follow it exactly. They apparantly didn't factor in the movement of the planet and maybe the exact time of the firing. We wouldn't have some kind of computer to factor in planetary movement? I find that hard to believe. Also, the laying down of the flight path is imprecise. It would be nice if you could have sort of a sniper feature to get the precise trajectoy you're going for. I think later in the game you get some kind of homing device that fixes this problem.\n\nDidn't see a way to repair cities or start new cities but that would just drag things out. The quick start didn't tell me about being able to fix or upgrade buildings but mostly aiming takes a lot of time and then everything gets fired at once and very quickly impacts with a teeny "biff" sound that is about the most unimpressive noise in gaming. SOASE has it right. "BAADUNG" and a huge cloud of dust goes up into the atmosphere. You can't follow these projectiles or slow them down so its very undramatic. Aiming is tedious and the whole game seems to be about aiming and upgrading things. You don't build any ships. You put up buildings and then try to maintain them. Think how crazy that is. You're making war with these distant planets but you have no way to invade and steal their stuff. The whole point of war is to beat them up and take over but in this game you can't. All you can do is destroy.\n\nWhen you research something there's no progress bar. They do give you a ratio like 212 of 450 but they didn't have enough money to put in the universally accepted and easily visible, moveable progress bars. It is also hard to see the slight change in border color when you select a thing to research.\n\nWhen you're rounds impact the planet you will not get zoomed in automatically to see the shells spectacularly impacting, destroying buildings and throwing cars around. This would have been a nice reward after all that tedious fiddling with the aiming system but its not included in this game. You will also not be rewarded with numbers popping up out of the destruction to tell you you've actually had some hits. All you get is a little "pft" or "pft, pft, pft. pft" if you hit with four rounds.\n\nNo dog pops up to laugh at you if you miss.\n\nInterplanetary is just like Kerbal Space Program if you replace the rockets with cannons and take out the assembly building, the parts, docking, career and any kind of designing.\n\nYou could also compare it to Sins of Solar Empire if you take out all the ships, the diplomacy, the trade and the pirates and the very impressive battles with many ships and dozens of special effects, the carefully balanced warrior civilizations that are all different. SOASE with just Novalith Cannons is Interplanetary. How bored are you? That might be a nice advertising slogan.","June 18, 2015","true","42.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The video on the picture scroll is showing gameplay that is maybe an hour into the game. When you start off you have one railgun and it is SO expensive to buy another which makes the game difficult. Also the Multiplayer is filled with hackers or people who have 1028 hours (not joking) on the game. And even with that the singleplayer is almost impossible BECAUSE you're AGAINST an AI player. So after the first shot from the AI's planet, about 8/10 shots will hit your planet. That may not sound bad, but ALL of those shots wont just hit your planet in an open field, they will hit cities OR weapons. Once all cities are desroyed you lose. Once all your guns are destroyed , you don't lose but you have to wait for income from your cities to buy a new gun.

As for local multi, that's not really an option for me. So online seems like it would be the way to go, but there's not really many people playing the game. I sat in the lobby for quite a while occasionally opening rooms, but it seems like there's 8 or 9 people that just want to play in private rooms all day and ignore me.\n\nPity, really.\n\nIn any case, the game itself is good, and I hope it continues to progress, but if something isn't done to facilitate matchmaking and adjust the AI difficulty then it could actually destroy this game.\n\nI'm choosing to be optimistic here and vote positive, but think carefully about it before buying this one.","January 16, 2015","true","3.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

If I had known this, I would not have spent the money on it.  At the very minimum, this should have some sort of single-player tutorial mode, which is not currently included.  I was forced to play 'multi-player-hotseat' with no one technically assigned the second seat.  Since there is no AI for the second player, then it becomes a game where you are defeating yourself.    As to the game mechanics, it is a type of gravity sim, where you fire kinetic rocks at your openent, OR lasers once you have the tech, and your firing is adjusted according to gravitical effects for kinetic weapons, affected by all other planets in the solar system, and can be blocked for lasers by line of sight issues if there is the sun or other planets in the way.  Rules wise, it all makes sense, but as a single player game, this is a complete no go.  Sorry folks, if you don't have friends to stop by and take the 2nd seat, you have nothing to do.  If you DO have friends to switch out the hotseat mode, then you have the issue where your friend can see everything you are building even though they technically do not have the technology by game rules to do so... IE over the shoulder views of what you are doing when you are sitting in the hotseat.","April 23, 2014","false","2.1"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","1"

The first time i played it, I played for 8 hours straight. While it is still in alpha, its a very impressive style of RTS that's much more relaxing than others I've encounterd. Like another reviewer said, it feels like a game, not a job.\n\nAs for some improvements that could be made, other "maps" (for lack of a better term) could be made, with elliptical orbits, larger neutral planets (with increased gravity), a second sun to orbit, or a black hole just as a couple examples.\n\nAI is pretty difficult to fight against. I'm pretty sure on turn 3 they have enough railguns to destroy every other planet in the solar system, while my planet is just building up some mines.\n\nThere isn't a huge player base, so multiplayer is kinda hard to come by, but whenever you play with a large amount of people, the outermost planet tends to win since its somewhat harder to shoot them from the innermost planets. Eliptical orbits could put everyone on equal footing.\n\nAlso, railgun op.

When you've got some weapons you strike at the enemy planet. If you forget to research the game won't let you proceed without something selected. Once you've killed your enemy's cities the game ends.\n\nPROS:\nIts not terribly difficult to get to play the game, build, aim, research and watch the ballistics fly.\n\nIt was introduced to me by a friend, if I hadn't I probably wouldn't have given the game a chance...

There was also one glitch where I ended up seeing the 'power' connections between buildings.\n\nOtherwise sometimes it's really difficult to tell where the ideal targets are unless, you get that spy tech & buildings.","August 29, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Frankly if this game came out of early access now I'd happily pay the undiscounted price for it. However what's best about this game is that there is more to come, and after the devs are excellent and active so I have no doubts that this game will continue to florish. If you have a group of friends this game is a must buy, or if you enjoy multiplayer strategy in general it is as well.

You hit next turn and the AI happens to have both super weapons and 15 railguns combine with 6 rockets and lasers. All hit with pin point accuracy and you have just been destroyed in one turn.

If you enjoy Sci Fi strategy games, get this one. The mechanics are solid, even if basic, but that's to be expected with a game in Alpha. It's actually challenging. In games like Civ, you can win, without ever really having a strategy, but with Interplanetary, you really have to strategise as you are meant to for a Strategy game. Watch a few gameplays, and see for yourself exactly how a game plays out. The only current flaws I've come across, is the lack of a Single Player mode, (which has been confirmed for future release) and the lack of complexity in the lobbies, such as, no chat, and no way to set up your lobby other than a password lock, (not to mention the rarity of actually finding people online to play with) But in order to find people online, you need to buy the game. Because it's in Alpha, the players still have some control over what should be changed about the game. So, all in all, I would strongly reccommend buying this game as soon as possible as to prevent it from slipping away.","May 5, 2014","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has only multiplayer though and I can never find anyone online nor a single player campaign/scenario (which I have heard they are implementing), but they do have a hotseat multiplyer which few games have now. The concept is fun and original, and while the tech tree is a bit simple, it's enough for now. I'm sure the devs are expanding it soon. The weapons all have different strengths/weaknesses and feel different. The shielding is useless from my limited experience on it though. Plus in a game which has planetvsplanet based warfare; you would think there would be colonizing options to make the solar system feel more alive, but there isn't. Yet I can still say that this game is very fun and with time I am sure it can surface as one of the most fun indie games out there.","May 11, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very pretty and the combat mechanics are a lot of fun, trying to aim rockets to curve around other objects in the solar system makes it a lot more entertaining than selecting a target and firing.\n\nThe development of planets is pretty simple with only about 10 different types of buildings you can build. This is both a blessing and a curse; it makes the game easy to pick up and I was fairly familiar to the mechanics within a few hours, but of course for people who playa  lot of strategy games it might be overly simple. Most things currently in the game seem well balanced, with the possible exception of the "super weapons". They seem rather overpowered and from my experience, most rounds just end up as a race to be the first to get one.\n\nMy online experience hasn't been great so far, I'm yet to complete a game online due to various issues with the game itself as well as people just dropping out of games. It's really disappointing because there is a lot of potential that isn't being found there yet. The non-online "hotseat" mode is a lot of fun as it stands and with private online matches or some sort of system to stop people dropping out (possibly reputation depending on how many games you finish?), the online multiplayer could be great too.\n\nThere's no single player as it stands, but this is of course planned and could be really solid too, as long as the AI are up to scratch.\n\nIn short, this game is good as it currently is, but I see the potential for it to be great, and at this price, who could argue with that?","April 26, 2014","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoy Sci Fi strategy games, get this one. The mechanics are solid, even if basic, but that's to be expected with a game in Alpha. It's actually challenging. In games like Civ, you can win, without ever really having a strategy, but with Interplanetary, you really have to strategise as you are meant to for a Strategy game. Watch a few gameplays, and see for yourself exactly how a game plays out. The only current flaws I've come across, is the lack of a Single Player mode, (which has been confirmed for future release) and the lack of complexity in the lobbies, such as, no chat, and no way to set up your lobby other than a password lock, (not to mention the rarity of actually finding people online to play with) But in order to find people online, you need to buy the game. Because it's in Alpha, the players still have some control over what should be changed about the game. So, all in all, I would strongly reccommend buying this game as soon as possible as to prevent it from slipping away.","May 5, 2014","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whether you're firing long shots across the solar system - slingshotting around multiple planets and hoping you correctly estimated where they'd be, or hunkering down as your planet counter-rotates between two enemy planets, making your preparations to fire both sides point-blank, there are a lot of satisfying moments in this game, certainly enough to justify the $10. I'm not even mad I didn't buy it while it was on sale.\n\nOne thing that bothered me was that there is a distinct advantage to being on the outermost planet; twice on every orbit of an inner planet, they are headed either directly towards or away from you, and your firing solution is dead simple. On the other hand, you are never moving directly towards or away from THEM.\n\nAnd be warned about the asteroid superweapon: it only fires from ONE point in the asteroid field, so its usefulness varies with where in the system your enemies are in relation to it.","June 25, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Except, it's not..\n\nA game like Interplanetary would be perfect to play on the fly, except between each 3-5minute turn you make you'll end up waiting 45seconds to a minute while the AI makes up their minds on what to do next... This bogs down the game completely and makes it a chore to continue playing towards the end. I have other complaints about the game, like how the inteligence system works and how it's hard to find which exact building has been disconnected from the power grid, but those I can live with.. But spending 1/3 of my in-game time twiddling my thumbs and waiting for the AI is just unacceptable and frankly really boring.","August 14, 2015","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the one hand, it is an interesting game, it's certainly unique, it's fun to play, and kept me occupied for a bunch of hours. But it's so frustratingly shallow! There's no diplomacy, so no reason not to attack absolutely everyone all the time. So combat isn't a strategic choice, it's just something you do, and something other people do to you.\n\nThere's no way to plan movement (your planet just always goes around the sun), so there's really no need for forward planning, or to watch what others are doing and react. The only interesting choices are in which buildings to construct, and if other people happen to blow your bases up along the way, you cope with it. And once you've figured out your favourite tech tree and building progression, you just do that every time.\n\nIt's a shame, because it's all built on a solid foundation and an interesting mechanic - it just feels like it needs more depth.","July 14, 2015","false","26.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you elect to do analytics then expect more issues with both modes. If you do somehow get the game to work... then expect slowdowns towards the endgame (I experienced around a 2-3 min wait per turn, with a pretty good machine, about halfway through the game).\n\nI did managle to make it through most of the way through a single game before it it kicked me off.

On the one hand, it is an interesting game, it's certainly unique, it's fun to play, and kept me occupied for a bunch of hours. But it's so frustratingly shallow! There's no diplomacy, so no reason not to attack absolutely everyone all the time. So combat isn't a strategic choice, it's just something you do, and something other people do to you.\n\nThere's no way to plan movement (your planet just always goes around the sun), so there's really no need for forward planning, or to watch what others are doing and react. The only interesting choices are in which buildings to construct, and if other people happen to blow your bases up along the way, you cope with it. And once you've figured out your favourite tech tree and building progression, you just do that every time.\n\nIt's a shame, because it's all built on a solid foundation and an interesting mechanic - it just feels like it needs more depth.","July 14, 2015","false","26.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I’ve played most of the Worms games and loved them (most of them), and I loved playing a game called Tanks way back in the early 90s. Yes I’m old. I had to break out of the retirement home just to write this review for you guys so please give it a thumbs up.\n\nAnyway, Interplanetary differs from all of the other artillery games I’ve played in that the developers have taken the genre into outer space. Boy does it work wonderfully in this new playground! Because planets are continually orbiting their host stars you have to predict where you think the enemy planet will be by the time your projectile will have reached it after having traversed the star system - very much like leading a target with a sniper rifle in a first-person shooter game.\n\nNot only do you have to take into account the movement of your target planet as it performs its orbit, you also have to consider the movement of other orbiting bodies, their gravity wells, and the fact that they may move in to the way of your otherwise well-aimed shot. I’ve often been saved from the onslaught of incoming enemy fire by an uninhabited planet “heroically” diving in the way to bear the full brunt of the barrage. Thank you, physics! :D\n\nMoreover, you have to take into consideration the rotation of your planet and that of the target planet too. If you’ve built a laser and it’s on the opposite side of your planet facing away from the enemy then it’ll be completely useless for that targeting turn until your planet has rotated to face the correct direction. Likewise, if you’re aiming for a particular enemy city and it’s currently on the opposite side of the planet, from your point of view, then it’ll make it a lot more difficult to hit, and you may even have to wait until the planet’s rotation has put it on the side that’s facing you to score a successful attack.\n\nVery basically, in each turn you can build, undertake research, and shoot at your enemies. You have to plan this carefully because firing lots of weapons in one turn may not leave you with any energy remaining to begin contruction projects that round. This is true the other way around: too much building and you'll have no energy left to fire your weapons. So it's best to go on the offensive when you've got easy shots lined up, and build up your planet when the targets are far away and with lots of celestial bodies obstructing the path.\nYou then win the game by destroying all of the enemy's cities and massacring the millions of civilians who, hitherto, inhabited it.\n\n\nPROS\n\n- Single player and multiplayer with up to 7 enemies in both cases. This can provide some very interesting and challenging matches, especially when one player's shot misses the intended target and hits someone else instead :D\n- Buildings and cities are upgradeable e.g. power plants can produce even more energy, satellite arrays have improved detection of enemy structures, HP increase...\n- Weapons are upgradeable e.g. increased damage, reduced power consumption,\n- Lots of great upgrades to research and unlock via the tech tree.\n- Great orchestral soundtrack that adds wonderfully to the atmosphere.\n- Firing a shot around the sun only to have it slung-shot back in your direction, hit your own planet, and destroy your own buildings is surprisingly good fun. There’s even a Steam achievement if you manage to do that! :D\n\n\nCONS\n\n- Relatively few weapons: rain gun, missile, laser, solar laser, asteroid diversion... That’s it, sadly.\n- The computer AI has pretty much perfect aim. In my experience the AI shots almost never miss.\n- All of the matches are played in just unary star systems (i.e. just one sun). I know it would make aiming interplanetary projectiles a lot more difficult in binary or ternary solar systems (2 or 3 stars respectively), what with all of the extra gravity wells, but it would be a great challenge for those who want a ‘hardcore’ game mode.\n- (as an extension of the last point) All of the host stars are just main sequence stars like our Sun. It would have been great to have had different star types like blue super giants and white dwarfs. With their differing sizes (and different mass) firing projectiles through the planetary system would require very different trajectories and velocities with such different stars. Also, their very different masses, and therfore gravity, would greatly affect the angular velocities of the orbiting planets - another factor that would influence how you’d have to plan your trajectory paths during the targeting phase.\n\n\nI’d easily give Interplanetary an 8 or 8.5 out of 10. It would instantly get an extra point if the developer added the “missing content” outlined in my cons section.\n\nIf you like turn-based strategy games, with excellent artillery action which requires precise planning, and also involves base building with research then Interplanetary should be an insta-buy for you.\n\n\nAs always, leave any questions below and I’ll get back to you.\nHappy mass-murdering!","December 13, 2015","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whether you're firing long shots across the solar system - slingshotting around multiple planets and hoping you correctly estimated where they'd be, or hunkering down as your planet counter-rotates between two enemy planets, making your preparations to fire both sides point-blank, there are a lot of satisfying moments in this game, certainly enough to justify the $10. I'm not even mad I didn't buy it while it was on sale.\n\nOne thing that bothered me was that there is a distinct advantage to being on the outermost planet; twice on every orbit of an inner planet, they are headed either directly towards or away from you, and your firing solution is dead simple. On the other hand, you are never moving directly towards or away from THEM.\n\nAnd be warned about the asteroid superweapon: it only fires from ONE point in the asteroid field, so its usefulness varies with where in the system your enemies are in relation to it.","June 25, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a game that's simple to learn, but you probably never master. I opened my first game and it gave me a tutorial that unlike so many game tutorials these days didn't leave me either constantly checking back (the UI is so simple that I read the tutorial (all 7 screens of it, most of which were images showing what you're looking for, which shows you how simple it is)) or getting to a point where something new is developed or unlocked but I have no idea how to use it.\n\nBut despite the fact that I learned the game in about 10 minutes, the actual playing is a great challenge. You want to hit a target? Ok, so you go to targeting, pick your nice laser (a relatively late unlock but simplest to target) out of your weapons... but your laser is on the wrong side of the planet. So you switch to your railguns. Its on the wrong side too, but that doesn't matter. You get a nice red line that shows the path your projectile will take through the gravity wells of the planets and star (though not the odd little asteroids that might randomly jig it mid flight) and line it up on the planet. You lock on and proceed to resolve the turn. Your projectile flies off and misses the planet by just enough to swing around it and career into the star because you didn't factor in the movements of all those planets you slingshotted around and the movement of the target itself. My first few shots missed by half a solar system as I got use to it. Plus, its a very different animal targeting a planet if your projectile is chasing the target compared to if the planet and projectile are coming together head on (for me, the chase shots are much harder as the projectile takes longer to catch the planet so there's more time for error).\n\nAll in all a great romp, and a step in the direction of something I've wanted to see for a long time (space combat between fleets using the actual physics of a solar system where everything is orbiting the star rather than the games like Star Trek Armada or Sins of a Solar Empire (both of which I love) where you just fly in a straight line toward where you want to go).","May 21, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So the things that i'm missing in this game are: ability to go to another planet, be-able to launch satellites or some kind in space, even invading them with .

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopinclumpin/recommended/278910/","poopinclumpin","PoopinClumpin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopinclumpin/","305 products in account","Short take:\nInitially fun game, with potential for strategic depth. But very little of either after a first or second playthrough.\n\nPremise:\nBuild your railguns and missile silos and fire them at everyone else in the solar system; it's a deathmatch. Don't forget to pick something to research!\n\nThe deal:\nThe fun dries up quickly though. The reason it does is actually the ultimate failure of the game. The part of the game that should be joyful and exciting, the aiming and fire controls, are poorly done. It comes down to nudging your mouse one more pixel to the left to get the wacky flightpath indicator to fart out a viable firing solution. Also, rather than group firing all your weapons, you must repeat this tedious process FOR EVERY SINGLE WEAPON YOU BUILT ON THE PLANET. That's right, if you built 10 missile silos, you must use the awful mouse-nudge to trajectorize and fire each single weapon separately, every time, every turn.\n\nThen, the resulting destruction isn't at all satisfying. It can be fun to line up a curving shot with an (unguided) railgun slug on a target planet. But the result is just a sad pop sound. Comically, the only real confirmation that you have succeeded in destroying a city with over 40 million presumably human inhabitants, is a little skull icon in the screenside combat log. Do this a few more times to win the game. Yes, that is the bulk of the gameplay, and yes, it's pretty much that simplistic.\n\nThis might lead you to think that there's some sort of nuanced underlying depth going on that makes for great PvP or something. Unfortunately, that is not the case. WYSIWYG.\n\nSide note on some design flaws:\nMy overall feeling is that certain things were included in a derivative (I know "Cargo Cult" is cliche now) way without the real understanding of how those game elements impact the the whole. Example, a research tree is included so cities can generate science points and unlock new upgrades, just like every other game that has this tech tree element.\nBut here it seems to just be there as a thing to do. At no point does it feel like focusing on one section of the tree while neglecting another has a major strategic consequence the way it would in well-designed games that include this feature for an actual reason... So, I'm left with the feeling that it's there 'coz that other game has it.  Any other tiered-tech per-structure system might have made the game more strategically interesting. Perhaps small tech trees for each building, forcing the player to choose to upgrade now for more instantly gratifying damaging shots, or hold off to expand the structure later for higher potential outcomes but a higher potential loss if the building gets destroyed. There are other examples of this throughout but that one stands out.\n\nBecause there's good potential, I could go on for a long time about similar relatively simple and meaningful ways the game could've been improved.\n\nShould I buy it?:\nWait for a major price drop, or sale. I suggest not spending more than $5 as, optimistically, you might get 5 hours out of it; unless it strikes some kind of chord with you.","June 6","false","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
