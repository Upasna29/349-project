I remember enjoying playing this a few years ago when I bought it in store when it first came out. Since then I've lost the CD and randomly thought to buy it again. I downloaded it from Steam and immediately noticed that the file was corrupted. The skins for many objects are missing and the game crashes nonstop. After a week of owning it now it crashes back the desktop as soon as the game loads. First I thought it had just installed bad so I reinstalled it but had the same problem. I quick google search of my problem revealed that I'm not the only one who is having issues with Steam's version of this game. It's a shame they have a no refund policy. As advice to anyone thinking of buying this; go for it! It's so fun for tycoon lovers. Just don't get it from Steam.","March 3, 2014","true","5.9"," 52 of 55 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","52","55","2","2"

Think of Monopoly meets Sim City, it is sort of like that. I've owned this game for several years on the PC, but recently added it to my steam library, so I played it again for a while and found it very easy to get back into the groove of the game. The game is pretty simple, build up New York City, one area at a time, while competing with several other NPC Tycoons who are doing the very same. You can buy out businesses, upgrade existing ones and more. This game was a lot of fun years ago, and while graphically speaking it is a little out of date, and the camera controls can be a little funky at times, it is still fun to play.","September 20, 2015","true","22.0"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","1"

I launched the game just to try it so I could put it in my 'hidden' list. Before I knew it, I was 2 hours into the game.\n\nYou won't hear me say this game is better than the games I just mentioned. Tycoon City: New York, is a pretty basic city builder but there are a few things I found interesting. For instance, you are able to add certain items in front of building like; flowers, benches, banners and satellites. Also, you do not own every building in New York but you are able to buy them of your opponents.\n\nThe game was released in 2006, so the graphics obviously aged and there are some problems with the textures in this Steam version. Naturally, the game only takes place in New York, so it helps if you like the city's buildings.\n\nTycoon City: New York, is not the greatest city builder ever but it's still fun to play, if you don't mind the graphics and simplicity. You should, however, not get this game at the regular price.\n\n","May 25, 2015","true","2.2"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","24","29","0","3"

Of course the graphics are also sub-par but in 2006 these graphics were the bomb tbh.\nBesides that gameplay wise the game is quite fun, you run New York thats about the gist of it, theres a variety of buildings and building styles for each district not everything looks exactly the same, tbh I don't even think I got through every building the game has so that says something. You also get a bit of customization with the exterior of buildings, but this has a bit of a bug because some buildings will not let you place items in the right place or let you place items at all.\n\nOverall, the game has problems but when you fix them the game is enjoyable just like any other city builder out there.","October 29, 2015","true","27.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Some people will hate this game and hate on it for being so simple. but this game is acctually genius i love it and its very well developed for a city building sim. you basically are in new york with around 20 other AI business people the idea is to make the best business. then the best chain of stores with a massive depot office one you have developed enough sucsessful businesses of the same type.\n\neach sim can be stopped in the street and they have a large pool of information concernuing where the like things etc etc, its acctually all the right information depending on the type of personality the sim has, they also work or attend education. you dont have to just build shops and resturants, you can build accomidation, entertainment venues, hotels, luxury locations for the rich and famous providing they have a suitable enviroment, education building and some council buildings, depending on you invividual busnesses succsess you will watch you quirqy empire rise to the top from being the only deli in the over developed office section, or your art shop in the middle of knowhere that you built by accident suddenly hit city record sales from the rich and famous attending the new entertainment venues nearby.\n\nits just so much fun to watch and plan.\n\nHOWEVER, this is the very bad current steam version on the game and a few in game items will not work and just appear as blank texture boxes in grey. Unless you are a die hard fan i would stay away until the textures are fixed or some nice person makes a workaround for the steam version (i hope they do) i love this game.

The tutorial will annoy you so much you'll want to quit the game before even playing it.\n\nThis game was part of a bundle I bought sometime in the past, so I went ahead and installed it.  I wasn't interested in the game at all, but the genre of city-building is always an interest of mine, so I gave the game its just chance.  It just did not have the same addictive feel I got from other city-building games, like SimCity and dare I say it, CitiesXL.  There are some nicely implemented features for upgrading buildings, which adds a hint of tower defense to the mix in a way, but overall, it just wasn't a fun game engine to build in.\n\nThe biggest issue I had was with the visuals in general.  Everything looks horrible and feels even worse.  I know that visuals don't make the game, but well, this type of game really needs to have good visuals.  You're building for the sake of building, it just needs to look good, and yet it does not look good.  Objects are floating inches above the ground for no reason, and you cannot rotate the orientation of any objects other than buildings, which rotate automatically to face the nearest road/sidewalk.  Characters look terrible, but in all fairness, there are some nice sounds to some of the entertainers.  Animations are very choppy.  Camera controls are easy to learn but the camera itself likes to mess up a lot when zooming through buildings and other obstacles.","February 25, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Graphical issues may happen because of your graphics card driver (like the sprites of some plants)\n\nThe money ingame always goes up, so your main goal is to increase it as fast as possible.\nThe "chances" are also nice goals to aim for, but often you don't know which buildings you have to set.\n\nThis game is more for kids, i think, because theres no way to loose money, you can't make mistakes.\n","March 22, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

This is not like most city building games.  Your streets are already pre-defined and the buildings cannot be build just anywhere...only in the zones that they tell you that you can build in.  The building selection is very small, and some of the buildings are glitchy at best.  The transitions between water and land are unrealistic, and the maps have giant blank pieces in them.  I have also experienced issues with the game crashing.\n\nI did like how once you built a building, you could add extras to the building to enhance it's influence.  However, this also means that you really can't build and move on... To maximize the effects of the buildings that you build, you need to customize every single one individually.  Imagine doing this for hundreds of buildings that you build.  Plus you need to moniter how each business is doing.  This is far too much micromanaging for me.\n\nThis game had some good parts, but I would recommend passing on this one.","September 20, 2015","false","12.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

YOU CAN RESOLVE THE TECHNICAL ISSUES\n\nThis is a great game.  It took me about a full day of reading the community guides and playing with screen resolutions and shutting down processes in the task bar to actually get it to work though.  But, once you have get it working, it's a lot of fun.\n\nIf you seriously would get a kick out of developing NY city, and I certainly do, then you'll want to make this game work.  You basically manage property and build different types of residences, stores, restaurants, bars, landmarks etc.  The game is fairly easy and the short beginners tutorial makes it easy for most people to pick up.\n\nThe gameplay centers around understanding the needs of the nearby residents and building attractive businesses, services, etc. for them.  You generate income this way and each thing you build costs money.  You not only build a business, take a burger joint, for example, but you then spend these points on what you'd like -- a burger mascot, shrubs, a neon sign, etc.\n\nI suppose the game has that sim nerd element but it's hardly hardcore sim management.  It's quite friendly and approachable.  The graphics aren't stellar, but the concept is pretty cool.  If you get excited thinking about building your own version of NY city then go for it.\n\nThe community guides section of Steam has a post about what you need to delete if you are having game crashes.  I needed to follow it.  There are two folders that you need to delete.  The guide talks about checking every single file in these folders but I just took them right out because I didn't have time to play programmer.  The game then ran without crashing, and my save games weren't affected.  Also, if you have the quit to desktop or minimize to desktop issue make sure that your Windows screen resolution is configured in the games config section.  They should match otherwise you may have problems.  I hope those tips help.\n\nSo why not take a break from the intensity of Simcity and try this one out -- I'm glad I did!","July 21, 2015","true","6.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

HOWEVER, the steam version is NOT. DeepRed decided to yet again ruin customer trust by releasing a broken game (last was hospital tycoon) and now they did it once again. The original Tycoon City NY was great. Lots of fun, probably one of the most clever, funnest and in depth city builders of all time. It was huge, nice big open world with every citizen having their own personality and name, everywhere had something going on, etc.\nSadly, Deep Red decided to release a clearly corrupted version. Textures are missing, videos wont play when supposed to, character models are missing so when Terri Delany, the news girl, comes on to report news, its just her clothes floating in the air and her talking, but her body is missing. (I'm not kidding, look at screenshots)\n\nThis is totally unacceptable and should be pulled right away from steam. So many images, complaints and bad reviews and yet this is still here. Its broken, messy and no, it is NOT our hardware. Many of us tested the original CD Rom copy (I know I did!) and it works 100% like it did when it released. But this version was clearly ripped off a broken copy of the game somewhere in their offices and not even tested before it released, because this is not the same version as retail. First off, the 2006 version is 2 versions ahead of the one on steam, yet this was added to steam a few years ago. Clearly they released a beta version on steam and they didn't know (or did they?).\n\nPlease, for the love of everything, report this game, get it removed. Buy a used copy on ebay on CD. Its a FANTASTIC game, but this steam release IS NOT.\n\nThere is a patch online that is pretty hard to find, but was released by a fan who had the original game and patched the steam version. Its hard to find but you can look it up on moddb or something. Maybe it will appear.","February 14","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
