This is a very competent sequel to a great game. It iterated on a couple things and changed a few things that were already established but all in all it was a pretty good game.\n\nPros:\n-Great fantasy sim type game. I don't know of many games like it where you recruit heroes but don't control them.\n-The added party system is my favorite thing by far to come from the sequel.\n-The graphical update to the series was well done.\n\nCons:\n-The difficulty can easily spike and you can't recover from lost heroes. You will have to restart the mission and it can be frustrating.\n-I don't like what they did with temples; you can only build them on certain holy sites. I prefered Majesty where you could build them where ever but building one temple would lock out other temples.\n\nI would certainly recommend this game. Especially for people who were fans of the original. I certainly was and I like the sequel a lot. I would also recommend picking up the orignal.","November 27, 2013","true","11.1"," 58 of 65 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","58","65","0","1"

Anything you may have liked about the first Majesty has been changed for the worse or altogether taken out of the game; I'd make a list, but it would take entirely too long. Big defects of this game:\n-AI is terrible. Characters hang around the castle area more often, accomplishing nothing. Flags do little to motivate and when they actually manage to catch the attention of a hero, the hero usually rushes to his death - they are either too stupid to run away or, more likely, one of the  unimaginative monsters are overpowered and heroes have no chance against it.\n-Stories are poorly thought out or are nearly the same as quests found in the first game. It seemed that the developers focused more on the mildly humurous jokes made by the advisor/narrator and less on anything novel or interesting for former Majesty fans. Even if you could get past the monotony of the quests, there are only a handful of quests available.\n-Finally, the largest problem in my opinion is the fact that every quest other than the tutorial, regardless of the supposed difficulty, is nearly impossible to beat without finding loopfole or cheap trick to finish th mission. Now, I'm not saying it's annoying because it's a difficult game, I'm saying that I have repeately run into situations where, had I not already attempted the quest several times, I would have had no chance of surviving regardless of the tactics or steps taken. Amost every quest I've played allows you a mere minute before waves of rats, skeletons or even more powerful creatures bombard your town. If you manage to take care of them, there's bound to be another directly after that one. Basically, every monster spawning point continously creates monsters who, instead of wandering aimlessly as was seen in the original Majesty, run directly toward your town to assault buildings or heroes. The sheer amounts of these monsters is astounding. And after a small number of in-game days, your city will be filled with sewers and a graveyard that also spawn large numbers of monsters. Basically, these monsters that aren't even a part of the mission's plotline truly ruin the mission at hand and cause the player to focus on defending the city for the majority of quest. Only once EVERY creature spawn point has been destroyed can a player even BEGIN to focus on the quest itself.\n\nTha game seems like it was thrown together with little thought put in to the story or the ease of playing the game; I wouldn't be surprised if I found out that it was never even tested before release. I know this review probably just sounds like the rants of a noob who can't deal with the difficulty of the game, but I honestly think that this is one of the worst games I've ever played. Actually, writing this review has gotten me so worked up, I think I AM going to list all of the problems, little and small, that I've found so far:\n-Poor Artificial Intelligence\n-Too many monsters to deal with -always attack your town\n- The quests are nearly the same quests found in the original game\n- Few things are explained or have tips; If you haven't played the first one, you probably won't know what is going on\n- Fewer buildings and types of heroes\n- Can't control which buildings should be taxed/ repaired\n- Many areas of the map cannot be built on - No apparent reason.\n- There is no more "seriousness" to the plotline as told by the advisor. Everything is a less than hilarious joke, usually about the same apparent alcoholism the narrator suffers from.\n- Everything in the game has a cartoonish/ childish look to them\n-Quest opening screens scroll through seemingly unrelated and aesthetically displeasing screenshots\n- Player can only build a limited number of buildings of a given type. This means a limited amount of income and heroes\n-Only one marketplace; Trading posts can only be built in predetermined areas.\n- Every quest about a single, powerful monster (Giant, dragon, etc.) begins with them attacking your town with no chance to prepare. They then continue to raid our town without relent.\n- All enemies are incredibly powerful against buildings. A rat/skeleton or two can take down several buildings if unattended.\n- Heroes do nothing on their own: Ranger do no explore anymore, rogues don't steal/ collect chests, warriors no longer hunt, clerics (healers) rarely follow and heal people, dwarves don't build (gnomes don't exist as far as a I know), elves no longer bring in lots of money, etc.\n- There is a "party" option which is supposed to aloow you to keep a group of four heroes together, however I could never get the party to accomplish anything of worth.\n- The ONLY way to make a decent amount of money is to search for trading post areas, build trading posts and hope that they aren't destroyed during or after the building process (Which they most definitely will be).\n- Buildings are weak (or, as mentioned above, the monsters destroy them very quickly.\n- Poor attempt at a map editor (too much too explain)\n- Camera views are awful - Can't zoom out very far\n- Camera panning controls are slow\n- Live cutscenes will interrupt any action you are currently doing\n- Sewers pop up often and spawn at least three rats at a time in the center of your town\n- Many quests require you to convince heroes to go to a certain location on the map. The only way is to use an explore/ defend flag which tend to only attract rangers and rogues\n- Rogues are melee and incredibly weak\n- The same hero spells/ improvements have to be researched at every building - not a central one such as a library\n- "His Majesty's" spells can also be researched multiple times if accidentall clicked, accomplishing nothing but loss of gold\n- Annoying voice actors\n- Many buildings/monsters have no description\n-I've played 6 quests and still can't build many of the buildings\n- As new buildings/ heroes are introduced, they're purposes are not always clear or explained\n- There is no explanation to what upgrading a building does.\n\nI'm sure there are many more issues I could find or have forgotton to list, but I'm done. Once again, don't expect anything fun or exciting if you decide to buy this game. I am most likely never going to run the game again; my interest in Majesty 2 has died as quickly as it started.","May 22, 2014","false","6.7"," 83 of 123 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","83","123","0","0"

I've never played first part and started with Majesty 2 and this review will be for people who just want to know if that's a good game.\nAs you can see I played 50 hours in that game, so this should be some clue. And I need to add that wasn't wasted time for me. Because this is just a great game. It's RTS but works little different to typical in that genre. As a king you show what needs to be done and your heroes will do it on their own, sooner or later. This little difference made this game totally different than other games in the genre.\nFor me that game was quite difficult, but I'm not a RTS expert.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you like to be a fantasy king, this is the chance to that dream come true.\nIf you're a RTS fan, you should play that game. Especially of the difference I mentioned before.\n\nLike this review?

I hardly ever write reviews but I felt like for all the negative reviews this game received, I have to defend it because, this is in fact a REALLY REALLY GOOD GAME!!! In fact, it's a game that I can't get bored with and do you know why, because unlike any other games, it's different every single time I play it!!!\n\nTo those, who said steam DLCs don't work, that's rubbish, it might be a personal isssue, I have all DLCs and the all work, I bought them 1 by 1, my brother bought the pack and it works for both of us (plus, I know a lot of other people whom it works perfectly on steam), so that's that...Not saying there isn't an issue, there might be, but please, don't state they don't work when they do for a lot of us!\n\nAlthough, you guys are probably right, in terms of comparing it to Majesty 1, yes it probably sucks. Don't know, I've never played Majesty 1, but I'd liek to make a point: for those, who haven't played Majesty one, I'd still recommend this game, you will not regret it, I promise, if you liked Dune 2/C&C/Dungeon Keeper, etc, you will like this, however, this will be different, but in a positive way :D!\n\nWhat I love in this game is that your heroes have their own will. I absolutely, don't agree with someone who said they don't do anything unless there's a flag prompting them to do it. Your heroes are interested in different things, the Barbarian is aggressive, the Paladin is rather defensive. The archer likes to kill animal type of monsters and theives are adventorous. There's a lot to this game and it feels like a lot of people played a few maps, didn't get what the game meant to do and just wrote a negative review because it's not like Majesty 1.\n\nThis game is really-really challenging and fun at the same time. I don't have any issues with restarting a map or reloading it, to me that's how all games shoudl be where you need to think about what you've done wrong and correct your mistake. At some point, I've had like 8-10 saves at different times on the same map so that I could restart if need be. And every single time I reload a map it never goes the same way because your heroes will behave differently. That's what gives the beauty of this game, what you can control is how strong they can get, give them missions, spend money on them and they'll give you more money back.\n\nTo those, who have said this game is impossible to complete, both my brother and myself have completed the full game including DLCs and yes, we've replayed multiple maps before completed them but that's the whole point. If you only like complete a game at the first go, then you really shoudln't play with strategy games!!!\n\nTo me this game is one of the best, I have ever played. It is a shame for sure that they took out some creatures and buildings but liek I've said, I've never played M1 so to me this game is perfect!!!!\n\n10/10 Please, try yourself, don't listen to the negative comments, this game is worth every penny!!!! I really hope, there will be a Majesty 3!!!!!","November 17, 2014","true","101.3"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"

And since the only way to have any sort of control over the units is to plant reward signs over objectives, having competent A.I. is important, and yet Paradox managed to make the the "heroes" even dumber, greedier and shortsighted than in the original. Yes, I said greedier: Finding yourself wasting thousands of gold on glass cannon wizards because they repeatedly get tunnel vision and attempt to run past hordes of enemies for a pitiful bounty, only to act surprised when they're brutally mobbed, is nothing short of infuriating. Other times, heroes will ignore their homes being burnt to the ground because they're too busy buying new armor (and yes, in the original, they WERE capable of noticing when their home buildings were being attacked) or attempt to take on targets WAY above their league.\n\nTrial and error is a huge part of this game, which shouldn't be the case. Take the forth mission: I wouldn't have a problem with a massive dragon coming almost instantly to wreck havok to set the stage, but half the time it starts by immediately burning the buildings I just built to the ground, wasting huge amounts of my precious resources. And this was AFTER the narrator told me "be careful not to alert the dragon, or he'll attack you before you're prepared"... which turns out is complete misinformation because the brute comes after you immediately no matter what.\n\nGet the original.

The biggest problems with Majesty 2 is the fact that the game is exceptionally grindy for a so-called Fantasy Kingdom Sim...which it isn't at all.\n\nYou can barely get a minutes breath without being constantly attacked by swarms of monsters attacking you from every angle, whilst your so called heroes are usually all dimwitted or just plain greedy especially when a high level monsters appear, and it doesn't take long for some nasty ones to appear....base defenses are completely useless, they are destroyed extremely fast so most missions are really only beatable if you zerg - zerg - zerg all the objectives as soon as possible, any focus on building your kingdom is a waste of time and ultimately will cause you to lose as soon wave after wave of ever increasingly difficult monsters start attacking your town.\n\nThe biggest and most game breaking issue with Majesty 2 is severe balance issues,  some missions feel like they rushed when they were designed, or perhaps lack of sufficient playtesting?    Overall, Majesty 2 isn't really that 'hard' per say, its more like finding one strategy for each map/mission that works and sticking with it, usually every other method results in  failure and frustration for the player.","May 13, 2015","false","1.5"," 27 of 45 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","27","45","0","0"

The twist of only being able to indirectly influence your "units" (via a flag system of rewards that you have to pay for) makes it refreshing and stand out from the pack. Replayability is immense due to the randomise set-up option. Your units are heros (individual archers, warriors, mages, healers etc) that level and gear up as you progress through any given mission. You can also carry over up to 3 of them to subsequent missions. Once you research the prerequisite you can organise them into parties of up to 4 individuals (i use classic tank/healer/2xdps). The game looks beautiful, plays smooth and bug-free, and never fails to satisfy. The voice acting is extemely well acted and the lines well-written and amusing.\n\ni have two small gameplay dislikes:\n1) all the heroes have to physically gather at the selected inn in order to form parties. while youre waiting for the correct  last member to arrive the rest of your settlement is vulnerable (and it can take a while).\n2) The building placement is affected by the corpses (represented by amusing little gravestone markers) of fallen enemies. You have to wait for them to despawn before you can place a building. bear in mind theres constant spawning of rats from sewers and skeletons from your graveyard withing your settlement almost "from the word go", this can be quite irritating as your trying to lay out your buildings.\n\nOther than these minor gripes, the game is an absolutle joy. a real gem. I can not recommend it highly enough to a wide variety of players and play-styles. In my opinion is an unsung and hidden gem amongst a lot of over-hyped garbage. I am sure you can pick it up for peanuts in a sale, but iirc its very cheap even at full price.\n\nHighly, highly recommended. You will certainly get a very good return for your money.","April 28","true","260.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If they had called it something else I would have given it a pass as a spinoff, but a numbered sequel should be judged by how well it lives up to the core experience of the game comes from.\n\nMajesty 2 is not a spiritual successor to Majesty, it's not a sim game at all, it's an RTS. The AI Monsters just run straight towards the castle on auto attack paths never doing anything truly interesting or immersive. The heroes don't even wander about on their own and never take their time doing anything sim like. The indirect control sounds similar to describe but is functionally very different because the heroes don't act like heroes they act like mindless patrol drones.\n\nThis game has the base level charm but none of the soul of Majesty. I'm intentionally using metaphysical sounding words because I know a certain soulless corporate robot with contempt for Majesty fans is incapable of comprehending their meaning.","August 1, 2014","false","40.8"," 41 of 79 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","41","79","0","3"

Level design.\n\nIn the first 4-5 missions, the game holds your hand through different objectives. You are expected to defend your town, but can generally work at your own pace.\n\nAll this changes after you beat the mage. After that, you have two different missions to choose from. One starts you off surrounded by several monster-spawning sewers (where in previous games you might see one spawn every 10min), and the second mission has a frigging dragon and its spawn coming after you, right off the bat.\n\nThe starter 'guard' is never enough to hold back the tide, which leaves you desperately building your guild halls hoping the monsters ignore the defenceless villagers WHO ARE TRYING TO BUILD SAID GUILD HALLS. Of course the alternative is they go after the peasant houses which generate gold. So now you have guild halls, BUT NO ECONOMY TO BUY HEROES FROM SAID GUILD HALLS.\n\nI'm sure I could spend hours sifting through faqs and wikis until i finally have the 'trick', but this runs completely contrary to the whimsical first impression the game gives in those initial levels.","February 24, 2014","false","20.8"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

I admit there are some aspects of the game that I don't like- for example, temples can only be built on limited holy sites.  Enemy AI directs them right at your kingdom, meaning that your town is under constant seige.  Many of the missions are absurdly difficult.\n\nHowever, they've made some excellent improvements to the gameplay as well.  You can research special attacks for your heroes to use, increasing their effectiveness.  New bounty flags are super handy, especially the "Protect" flag.  While hero ai is still questionable, they can now recognize the collective threat posed by multiple enemies, which they couldn't in the previous game.\n\nOverall, I'd say if you liked Majesty back in the day, go ahead and pick this up when it's on sale.  It isn't an amazing game, but it is decent, and more importantly, its Majesty.","September 27, 2014","true","113.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The sequal does not disappoint in that reguard I love it just as much as the original.\n\nIt's a fantasy kingdom simulator, a strange style of RTS, where you build your town and defenses, but instead of directly influencing where your heroes go by selecting and clicking where you want them to go, you place bounties on monsters, or explore locations, and they will get interested and go to that area, they will go to the market in town and buy potions, sleep at the Inn to recover, or go to the smithy to buy new armor and weapons.  The game has a great sense of humor and a great presentation.\n\nIf nothing else give the demo a shot, but I have to think anyone would love this game.","April 4, 2011","true","24.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game isn't as bad as some have made it out to be. The core concept is very close to the original majesty game; its just that they decided to make it very random, which leads to some very hard missions. Rather than taking a few extra months at tweaking the AI and game play, the developers seemed to have said "Screw it, we can make this really challenging by creating maps with fast spawning monster generators next to the players base and call it a day."\nThe patches have fixed numerous issues, but I would not recommed that you get this on steam. The reason being is that based on the date of this review they have only released 1 of the 3 expansion packs, and it does not seem that steam will be porting the others anytime soon. For some reason they have also opted to excluded the Paradox Store, meaning that you will not have access to some of the DLC provided by the expansion packs. The same goes for the IMPULSE version of the game.","February 13, 2011","true","159.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Sell potions, create quests, build guild halls and watch as heroes bumble about looking for gold and glory.\n\nThe player builds a very basic medieval-style town by placing shops, guilds and defensive structures, while peasant houses, graveyards and sewer exits appear on their own, making for a unique town layout each time you play. Watching the heroes accomplish quests and then spend their hard-earned gold in your shops is immensely satisfying, and the humour is surprisingly effective.\n\nThe game is not without a few shortcomings. Your lack of direct control over the heroes will mean that you will occasionally fail time-sensitive quests, and certain missions are in major need of some balancing. On more than one occasion I found myself having to consult online forums to see what I was doing wrong.\n\nDespite these few shortcomings, however, I find myself re-installing Majesty 2 again and again, months after having finished it, just to play it through completely once more.","October 28, 2013","true","47.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Build your city, upgrade buildings, hire heroes and then pay them to go on quest, defend your city or kill monsters.\n\nThe Humor in Majesty II is fantastic. I stay amused by the “Plot” of the campaign, but this is not a deeply affecting story. Ultimately if you like the management part of an RTS (Like Command & Conquer, or Warcraft) but you don’t want to deal with all that pesky war stuff; then this is the game for you.\n\nI highly recommend this for casual or serious gamers looking for something fun.

The gameplay is the same.  The hero incentives are the same.  The base building is only slightly altered.\n\nThe music is absolutely terrible.  I turned it off after 5 minutes.  The campaign narration and text might as well not be there.  The campaign has no incentive to replay, and the missions are all pretty much the same.  Additionally, the lords system is too weak to be useful or fun.  The standalone single player missions are probably better than the campaign msisions.\n\nThe game's interface has some problems.  There is no option to customize hotkeys.  There are not hotkeys for frequently clicked spell abilities.  The camera movement has no insta-move-- only scroll.  There is no hotkey to jump to the last notification message.\n\nThe base game is certainly worth the $2.50.\n\n\nThe monster Kingdom expansion is a failure. The monster AI seems to have worse AI than the vanilla.  It can be very difficult to get units to attack or explore at times.  It has typos in several places.  The unit balance has problems. Some missions frequently crash.\nI'd recommend staying away from the Monster Kingdom expansion.","May 22, 2014","true","32.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You are the King and you provide the architecture for your heroes like marketplaces or guilds, which offer equipment or skills.  The money the heroes spend on the goods goes to your treasury as well as the taxes your collectors obtain.  They all are their own heroes just looking for adventure making their own stories.  You can place bounties on monsters, lairs, exploration, and structures needing defense.  Great game if building kingdoms sounds fun to you!","January 15, 2011","true","25.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This is an RTS.  You build a few shops and build guilds where you can build "heroes".  All your units are heroes.  The more buildings and heroes you have, the more taxes you get.  Here is where the game gets original.  You have no (direct) control over the heroes.  They wander about and do as they wish and buy goods from your shops (gaining you more money).  To get them to do what you want you have to bribe them.  Want an area of the map revealed?  Put a dollar amount on it, the more you put on it the faster it gets done and the more heroes show up.  The tricky part is that unless they are close to enemies you have to bribe them to attack them or to defend your buildings or attack an enemy building.  I would have played all the way through this game except for an absurdly hard level that is timed and forces you to memorize the map.  The collection is worth 20 bucks.","May 18, 2012","true","22.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This is indeed a real time stategy game where you don't really control your unites. Sounds odd? - well its not! Its brilliant but emotionally confusing, which is an odd mix some might say. The bottom line is, you build and plan you "base" and units as you do in any RTS but they manage themselves so you don't have to hassle with the micro or actually unit control almost at all. Its way more relaxed then lets say Starcraft but a bit more tense than CIV.","October 9, 2011","true","11.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This entire game just becomes an endurance run against zerg rushes that happen way too soon in every mission. At first it's enjoyable, but at the very flipping fifth mission it just beats you down hard with hordes of enemies that appear the moment you have just two guilds up. The difficulty spike that happens just ramps up the challenge so high that often it feels like you survive only due to luck rather than any sort of skill or strategy.\n\nLike half the time you will pretty much die under an unbelievable five minutes. The missions aren't even short either, they usually take about an hour or two to complete.

There is no strategy in the Campaign. If you're thinking it looks sort of like the brilliant Age of Empires series and that you should buy it, you may want to dig up some videos, 'cause this is nothing like it. Terribly overloaded by the 6th or so scenario where I was against a dragon. Before I could even get 1 building up here comes 5 or 6 mobs and shortly after the dragon, which disposed of my unbuilt building.\n\nThe game play architecture is brilliant with individual characters from many classes leveling up on as they fight. But when you can't even get 1 building up before getting swarmed, it is time to move on. I'm sure it could be done with the exact right combination of buildings in the exact order, but that is not strategy, that is automation and a game on rails.\n\nIt could have been great, but the devs must not have had the brains to make the computer have brains, so they decided to rush the player. ♥♥♥♥ poor, sorry.","September 19, 2015","true","48.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had earlier said Majesty 2 is less than Majesty and it isn't, it's far better. They removed a lot of the extra-neat features Majesty had like the additional viewing screens to view heros. But everything else has been updated and improved, heroes are alot less adventurous on their own and won't wander off to their deaths as much. Also the heroes have more HP but that might just be increased for everything.\n\nI played Majesty as a kid and this game has most of the gameplay from the last game with half of the cool features. I've been playing for 15+ hours, wish I just bought the original in HD.\n\nWhat I've noticed they've removed:\n*They removed the sheets of enemy and hero stats, now the stats are simplyfied to; Attack, defense, armor, magic def, ranged def,\n*Attacks never miss, they arc through the air to hit their target, even meleee attacks gain super reach as your hero runs from a minotaur if it attacks it will hit.\n*There are no more mini-pictures to follow your hero's with.\n*Blacksmiths are ridiculously expensive, (Majesty went; 100,200,300) It costs; 250, 1000,3000.\n*The quality hero programming, hero's of the same type work in tandem a lot, effectively wasting half their potential.\n*No more gnomes, those guys were awesome, I haven't met them yet, if I'm going to meet them.\n*Dwarves forgot how to build, they are effectively tough warriors.\n*Wizards can't teleport\n*You can't view the list of hero's in a specific guild.\n*You can't tell what spells or skills a hero has.\n*The Temples don't follow their hate criteria, for example Paladins dislike Necromancers in the old game you couldn't build both, in this one you can, but apparentally the heroes will play pranks on the unliked race, I haven't seen it happen yet but I'm looking forward to it.\n*The Quest messages that pop up on screen are no longer clickable, the quest script is replaced with a quest tab.\n\n\nWhat I've noticed they've added:\n*Hero's change their appearances after raising level, even when they are wearing the same outfit, appearance doesn't change with outfit change, just level.\n*I think they added the party system.","July 24, 2015","true","30.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is very nice for people who like to micromanage as well as be part of an RPG. Many of the maps can be very challenging and the story isn't half bad either.","December 22, 2015","true","57.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then I bought it again on here to try it out.\n\nI'm sorry I did.\n\nThe main problem really is that your heroes are never where they're needed, or die so much which wastes your resources and creates the graveyard. Just... disappointing.\n\nMaybe try the first game instead.","December 25, 2015","false","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
