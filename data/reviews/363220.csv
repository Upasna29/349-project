It's easy to pick up, and yet nearly impossible to master. The controls and mechanics are unforgiving, but as you overcome them, you feel like you can defeat anything. This is a game that doesn't baby you, or hold your hand. It challenges you to get better every step of the way. On top of that, the graphics and sound serve to create an experience that make it my favorite game.","April 22, 2015","true","13.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

It's a mediocre platformer where everything is very hard to see. I'd recommend you just find one of the many free mediocre platformers, and play that instead.","November 4, 2015","false","0.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Throwback to NES platformers, you can run and jump.\n\nRUN AND JUMP!\n\nTo address the haters in this thread. Yea, the monochrome color scheme is 'iffy' and you might have problems if you are colorblind, but I did not feel like it detrated from the game. I thought the hitboxes were fine; reminiscent of playing Megaman and having to creep your toes over the ledge to the last pixel.\n\nThe game starts ez enough - and ramps up slowly, increasing the challenge as each level adds new puzzles and obstacles for you to overcome, constantly thinking and adapting as the levels advance. I'm about an hour in, and maybe completed half the levels, but I'm also very bad at these kinds of games. They are difficult, but not impossible - and that's something I really enjoy!","February 14","true","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/363220/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","3.5/10\nClearly only friends of developer reviewed the game. I love platformers, but this doesn’t have much to offer. No story. Every level looks the same with black background and different color poor pixelated platforms and spikes. That would be ok if the platforming were actually decent. For some reason you can’t see the map and only a tiny cone around you, making jumps usually into areas you can’t see, forcing luck and trial and error. When you can see you have to jump over and between spikes. Unfortunately the hitboxes are terrible. You are this giant guy who spreads his long legs open when jumping and need to land in this tiny too small gap between spikes. Since you don’t know where exactly to land you’ll land in the middle and your leg will hit, or something will be off. I died dozens of times just because how terrible done this was. Many times when I did land right one of my legs would be sticking into a spike but it didn't count it. Then if you  are between spikes and press forward + jump to jump forward out of between them, you will instantly die. You have to jump then move over, which is another problem. Then, triggered events happen offscreen. I would miss things because I couldn’t see them. No level direction either, I would have timed things to do but since I couldn’t see anything I wouldn’t know if I needed to go down or up or where to go. Same song plays in background, which gets annoying fast. Not really much to like here. If you want to have a good platformer you should do hitboxes and platforming and level design the opposite of how this game does it.","October 1, 2015","false","0.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The controls are crisp and the movement "feels" right. However, the unforgiving hitboxes, inability to judge foreground/background details, and completely unnecessary darkness torpedo this one.\n\nI REALLY don't get why the devs added the darkness - it's not something that a retro game would do (or even be capable of), and only serves as a source of artificial frustration.\n\nStill, the soundtrack is incredible.","January 5","false","0.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gitgud/recommended/363220/","gitgud","Makin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gitgud/","463 products in account","It has decent enough mechanics for a platformer. It reminds me of 1001 spikes in that the game is about mastering a couple actions instead of learning new things.\n\nHowever the game is too simple (and at this point in gaming history, boring) for its current price. Maybe when it gets a 75% discount. I don't recommend it at this point but I recommend it if it's cheap and you want platforming.","April 26, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Each stage is comprised of timed doors/locks, bear traps, treadmills, spikes, pistons, jumps, and climable walls. The creators play with these primitives to make some unexpected challenges. Sometimes the doors run horizontally and must be walked on to near the end before the door opens again dropping you into deadly spikes. Sometimes you must jump from climable wall to climable wall to platform to piston in a seemingly unbeatable gauntlet of spikes and bear traps. Each stage presents a unique challenge, requiring you to grow in skill before ever overcoming it. I highly recommend giving this game a shot if you like unique and exciting challenges.","November 27, 2015","true","17.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
