I believe I was initially attracted to the art, so I decided to purchase this on sale and give it a try.  The game starts out very well and I was quickly addicted.  I played five hours straight, beat the game, and obtained all the achievements.  I thoroughly enjoyed this experience; however I do have a couple gripes.  I feel like the developers simply gave up as they designed the last level.  The last level is essentially re-used, and extremely easy compared to previous levels.  Also, the game ends all too abruptly and leaves you scratching your head.\n\nBeing relatively new to this genre, I started on Casual.  I quickly found that the game was too easy, so I bumped it up to Expert.  If you’re not playing on Expert, your map will be marked with places that you have available actions.  This pretty much tells you exactly where you need to go, so I suggest you play on Expert from the start.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this game.  It is the first Hidden Object/Puzzle game I have actually completed.  For its current sale price, it is worth picking up if you’re a fan of the genre.","April 23, 2015","true","5.1"," 57 of 64 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","57","64","0","0"

The puzzles are interesting, the art is good, and the overall story is interesting. I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nThe game focuses on allowing you to follow a story more than anything. The controls are simple, all you do it use your mouse to progress through the game. The game is a decent length and allows you to enjoy it thoroughly before giving you an ending. In the game you will explore, collect items in your inventory, play mini-games, and find objects. You will be going from one area to the next utilizing the items you have collected to move forward in the story.\nThe story is fairly short in my opinion and the ending felt incomplete. This is a game that focuses more on telling a story and allowing one to relax as they adventure. The hidden object parts of the game are fun and enjoyable and each of the mini-games was different and fun to beat. As a point and click game it’s very well thought out and does well on capturing the story and allowing for a relaxing experience.\n\nGraphics/Sound\nThe graphics of the game are polished and very well done. The cinematic scenes are ok in my opinion. Each area you visit the art is great and some of the art can even be breathtaking. The voice acting is alright and the music is relaxing. The graphics and sound were good in helping to create a relaxing atmosphere.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Excellent Art\n+ Solid Story\n+ Different places show different aspects of life and how we live it\n+ Relaxing experience\n+ Interesting Concept\n+ Fun puzzles\n+ Diary to review what happened and find your current objective\n\nCons\n\n- Ending felt incomplete\n- Nothing was really explained in the end (how Alice got here/ if she is alright after driving off the edge)\n- Limited replayability\n\nFinal thoughts\nIt's been a long time since I have played a hidden object game or a point and click game. I am happy to say I enjoyed Mind Snares: Alice's Journey. The art was amazing, the music was good, the story was interesting, and the little lessons I saw were nice. The ending bugged me a bit and it just felt incomplete. However overall I enjoyed playing through the game from start to finish and it was nice to return to a hidden object point and click type of game.\n\nTL;DR\nMind Snares: Alice's Journey is a point and click hidden object type game. The art is done well and the graphics are beautiful. The music is alright and the voice acting is adequate. The game is well-designed and very enjoyable and quite relaxing to play through. The ending felt incomplete in my opinion and there is limited replayability. The puzzles and mini-games were fun to beat and the game was fun from start to finish.  Overall if you are a fan of hidden object, point and click, or just games that have an interesting story , then Mind Snares: Alice's Journey may be a game for you.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 25, 2015","true","5.8"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","36","45","0","2"

I found the Story to be interesting, yet rather bland for my liking. At the start of the 2nd Chapter I started to feel more attuned to it, but then shortly after it just dropped off again.\n\nThe Puzzles were moderate, I didn't get stuck on any of them and some did make me think a bit more than others, but nothing complicated.\n\nThe Hidden Object Scenes seemed rather pointless most of the time. I really couldn't see any connection with the items I had to search for, to the item I recieved afterwards. As this is only my second HOG I have played, I'm not sure if this follows the traditional ways of Mechanics or not. Either way, they are still nice to do, and can be very relaxing.\n\nThe Art style was nice, and the Music was ok. I felt that the Voice Acting was overdone in parts, but it was acceptable.\n\nThe Ending was a bit of a let down to me. It just didn't feel finished. Instead of leaving me with a sense of accomplishment with having everything in it's right place, I was left with a sense of disappointment.\n\nI don't think the Game was bad at all, but I just felt that it could have been polished a bit better in certain area's.\n\nGenre\n- Hidden Object / Adventure\n\nGame Elements\n- Hidden Object\n- Puzzle\n\nAverage Playthrough\n- 3.5 Hours\n\nLiked\n- Nice Puzzles\n- Great Art style\n\nDisliked\n- Found it hard to get into the Story\n- Pretty poor Ending","November 2, 2015","true","3.6"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","1"

You had a car crash.. falling through glass.. what is with this red electric in your veins?!\n\nPros\nA great plot. It's a really good story and well worth finishing it.\nPretty visuals. Nice art with cool coloring.\nGood puzzels that are fun to play through. You won't to hit the skip button all the time.\n\nCons\nIt's easy, even if you play at it's hardest level.\nIt's short. Less than 3 hours per play though.\n\nSo if you enjoy hidden object games. This is a good one, if a little easy and short. It has been made well, it's fun, and it's nice to watch.

The concept is solid as well as the storyline which is meant for a more mature minded audience.  The gamer can literally hear the "tiredness" in Alice's voice.\n\nStory: Since this game begins with the epilogue, the storyline is actually about when (and probably even why) Alice decided to become the owner and proprietor of her own business.  During the interview Alice relates how she worked in a job she hated (or in my opinion was tired of being taken advantage of by her boss).  She always wanted to start her own business but was afraid to (with good reason if one understands how hard that really is and the risk involved.)  Two years prior to the game beginning, late one evening (workaholic) before her vacation with her family was about to begin her insensitive boss sent her to an out of town business meeting. On the way to the meeting Alice is in an accident.  This is the beginning of her journey.  She wakes up in an alternate place (most likely her own mind) and must find her way back.\n\nGameplay: The journey takes place over 5 chapters, with the epilogue beginning the story and introducing the dark shadowy man who appears throughout the game as a quasi-nemesis.  The first chapter begins the journey and sets up the other four chapters which are separate "adventures".  Each chapter segment has its own goal, its own gather and use inventory and its own map making gameplay easy since there is no crossover between the chapter area and the "outside".  Each area must be completed before progressing to the next chapter.  The storyline concept plays out as each chapter is completed and is not overly "preachy".  This game could be considered to have a psychcological suspense/horror theme since no place is scary then inside one's own head.  Each area has its own terror theme.  I really liked Chapter 3 - Baba Yaga.  Seldom is the most notorious and terrifying witch Baba Yaga (and her chicken hut) ever seen in HOs and the designers added to it what I can only call that bayou zombie ambience making the whole area subtly terrifying.  Not that the other chapters did not have their own subtle terror.\n\nHidden Object scenes:  The Hidden Object scenes are fitting to the area they are found in and basically not piles of random "junk" found in random places.  They are uncluttered for the most part and the find clues are relatively easy to locate, except for one or two that either blend well into the background or are so obvious they get overlooked.  There are also "extra step" find clues such pouring wine in a glass for glass of wine, or striking a match to lit a candle for lit candle.   Overall not a huge challenge but challenging enough to not be considered too easy.\n\nPuzzles: Believe it or not the puzzles were theme oriented and the type found depended on the chapter theme.  Overall the variety was excellent and included mechanical, math, logic, rotating, picture, matching and "follow the recipe/design/blueprint" puzzles.\n\nThe point and click aspect of the game was about equal with hidden object aspect, and quite the challenge at times when trying to figure out what to do or where something was located.  Some of the achievements reflect both the humor and creative thinking of some of the point and click challenges.  Some say games never teach anyone anything so I wonder how many gamers had to look up 'hew' and  'decoction' to know what to do?\n\nJust a few comments to end this review.\n1) I wish the developers would have closed the game with a tiny short wrap up cutscene of ending the interview. Something as simple as "And that is when/why/how I decided to start my own business" over a handshake or something.  It would have added the proverbial "cherry on top."\n2) Watch the credits.  It is not very often anyone in any media takes the time to make credits interesting.  I found all the X-rays amusing and unique, especially the one of the Artifex Mundi logo.\n3) All Steam achievements can be completed in a single play through, which is always a blessing since I dislike forced second playthrough for achievements.  I for one am also glad to see achievements in-game or steam finally moving away from "solve x in x amount of time" and becoming more creative.\n4 and the last) There is a fast travel map, not that it is really needed.  No forced second playthrough (usually meaning on expert/advanced, and often with Artifex Mundi games the alternative "game" to the Hidden Object scene).  No extra "hidden/shifting/ghost" objects to find.  No penalties for map use, game hints (not to be confused with HO scene or puzzle hints), or misclicks.","October 18, 2015","true","4.8"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","3"

The puzzles needed a little more polish tough.\n\nLong version:Mind Snares: Alice’s Journey is an odd modern hidden object game, where the protagonist is just a normal everyday office worker called Alice Dahl, who doesn’t have to find a kidnapped relative, save the world from some mysterious dark entity, or investigate some weird occult site. She is just an average woman who suffers a car crash and traverses through her own mind to find her inner strength to face the hardships of her life, like her job slowly distancing her from her family.\n\nHer self-discovering journey is divided into four segments with their own themes (steampunk factory, fairy tale forest, witch’s hut, and phantom hospital). This story structure left little room for backtracking, but also cut the game short, where most of the play time is spent on the rather uninspired, mediocre hidden object scenes. They aren’t bad, but they also held back the final score, which could have been much higher just for this story alone.","November 23, 2015","true","3.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

When I fire one up I know exactly what to expect and I can mindlessly click through them as a way to wind down after work. After the eleven billionth title I've started to get sick of seeing the same puzzles: the concentric rings, the recipe for a potion, the safe combination, and so forth. I want Artifex Mundi to take a few risks and try something a bit different.\n\nAlthough Mind Snares follows the formula pretty closely, it does take a few risks by abandoning the usual supernatural theme in favour of a psychological inner journey. And instead of the usual abandoned child that needs saving, Alice is saving office workers from their demeaning jobs. So big ups for trying something a bit different.","April 13","true","3.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's a very dark toned inside your head kind of game. While I can't say the area/story flows well the gameplay itself is good. Very fluid puzzles and for the most part logical item usage making hints not really needed. That being said 2.3 hours is not a lot of game play so I can only reccomend picking this game up if you get it in a bundle, on it's own even on sale it's not worth it. The graphic quality while not as HD as some of Artifex Mundi's newest games, is still good quality.\n\nStory SPOILERS: You start off giving an interview about your book store and learn Alice was working at a job with a horrible boss who made her work long hours and miss out on important family events. On a drive to a location the boss couldn't make it so you had to fill in for, a sudden bolt of lighting strikes and you drive off the edge of a cliff. Sunddely you're inside your mind and battling a ghostly demon. The story never explains who/what it is or what anything in your mind is really. You see a picture that Alice said she drew as a child of her and her mother and this demon near thier house but that would imply she's lived with it her whole life? A woman is trapped in a tree that helps you but then she dies about 80% way through the game. Things just seem to happen and places you go dont seem to represent anything, they're just pretty. While yes one area is her workaholic spirit and another is her inner balance, it just seems like small aspects were taken and tossed together.\n\nEnd of Spoilers\n\nOverall if you're looking for a creepy hidden object game this game delivers, if you're looking for one with a good story, look else where and don't look here unless it's in a bundle!","April 29","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead of using a woman business-owner to solve a problem, this game focuses on a woman escaping the rat-race, itself.  But, that works just fine.  It's a good casual adventure Hidden Object Game (HOG) with good graphics, sound, and puzzles (the HOGs are even a bit more difficult to do than is normal).  Even the voice acting is fine for the genre.  I've only got a few quibbles with the game.  First, the final chapter is much shorter and simpler than the previous ones (call it a pacing issue), and second, the game is pretty short.  It took me 4.5 hours to finish the game with 100% Achievements.  So, even though I'm recommending the game, I feel it's over-priced at just about $10.

There's a decent amount of content: quite a bit of point-and-click adventuring, several (fairly easy) hidden-object scenes, and (medium-low difficulty) puzzle mini-games.

In the volume control section: music, sound and voice overs; separate adjustments. In the miscellaneous section: Game Difficulty, Custom Cursor, Full Screen and Aspect Ratio (this option only works if you play the game in full screen mode.)\n\nThe game’s difficulty menu has three options, Casual; Advanced and Expert, for you to choose from. The game’s difficulty can be adjusted in the middle of game play.\n\nThere isn’t much to say about the game’s voiceovers/music/sounds asides from that they are well done.\n\nThere isn’t much to say about the game’s graphics aside from that they are nicely drawn with a bit of painted feel to it.

Some items have “x” amount that required before using; the image changes when an item added to it.\n\nHybrid interactive hidden object scenes: traditional word lists most with find “x” amount of an item\n\nMost of the puzzles are rather simple to solve but while others would some and/or little extra necessarily steps to solve them completely; puzzles with a puzzle. There’s no reset button for the puzzles, with exception of one puzzle, but there’s a skip button for the puzzles.\n\nGame achievements are earned throughout the entire game.

The key legend on map explains the function each of the map icon. Fast travel from one location to another and back.\n\nThe game has an automatic save function, it saves whenever you exit to the game’s main menu, you can continue where you left off in the game.\n\nThere are four chapters in total but the length of the game depends how quickly the individual plays the game.\n\nThere are seventeen game achievements.

I generally expect their offerings to be good and I wasn't disappointed here.\n\nFirst off, I was pretty delighted to see a story go beyond the basic fairy tale or creepy story to actually give a message, and an important one at that.  It was beautifully handled and not overdone.\n\nSound and music were good quality with voice acting that actually sounded like they put some effort into it.  This is, as always, a huge plus for me personally although I know other people aren't bothered by bad voiceovers like I am.\n\nHidden object scenes are nicely done and properly challenging (ranging towards the easy side of the spectrum) without any weird naming issues; if it tells you to look for an apple, you're going to find an apple.  This isn't always the case with these games so it's a plus for me.\n\nPuzzles are essentially your usual fare for this style of game, variations on the normal variety you'll always see, but they are nicely done and graphically pretty, and I enjoyed myself.\n\nPlay time runs about three hours, which is average for this style of game.  My play time is longer as I was letting the game sit here and there to get some other things done.  Three hours is a pretty normal run time for these games, but I always feel that ten bucks is a little spendy for this kind of game.  Personally, I would wait for a half-off or better sale or coupon first unless money is no concern or you're used to picking these up at full price.

As usual for an Artifex game, the art is lovely and vivid, and the puzzles and minigames are solid and well-designed.\n\nThe ending is a bit abrupt, and strangely the game begins by revealing that Alice went on to start her own successful business, with the whole game as a sort of flashback explaining how she got the gumption to strike out on her own. That takes some of the suspense (such as it is) out of the story. And to be honest, I would have been happy to just solve the puzzles and explore the fantasy vistas without the framing narrative of Alice's stifling job and her journey toward self-confidence.\n\nStill, can't fault them for trying something different, I guess.\n\nI'd recommend a number of Artifex games ahead of this one. Dark Arcana: The Carnival is a favorite, with a strong story and striking visuals, and Grim Legends 2: Song of the Dark Swan is one of their most compelling and well-made titles. But if you've played those, and the Nightmares from the Deep series, and Enigmatis and Abyss... then I'd also recommend Mind Snares.","February 6","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It tries to stay dramatic the whole time, and that just isn't working. Dramatic only works in conjunction with non-dramatic. (Update: each chapter seems to have its own soundtrack, and that only applied to the first chapter.)\n\n- nice environments and some intriguing interactions here. Only one of the interactions has made me ask, "WTF was that?" but afterwards i had to admit that it kinda made sense.\n\n- the Damsel in Distress (DiD) vibe is truly creepy. Frustratingly so. i don't, in any way, shape, or form, enjoy the DiD trope except in the context of the "Empowered" comic book series (which exists to poke fun at that trope).\n\n- the protagonist's repeated self-derision just helps drives the DiD vibe home. It's hard to tell if she's supposed to be a victim or a hero, and victimized women is _not_ a theme i care to game.\n\n- all the little female dolls (in many of the scenes), most of them looking like sad, broken victims themselves, is bringing me down. Not sure how much more of that i can take. (Update: they disappear after completing the factory level.)\n\ni like the mechanics, i like the "physical feel," but i truly, deeply, dislike the whole DiD/victim/poor-little-me bit. The physics have a slighly different feel from the 10 or 12 (or so) Atrifex Mundi titles i've played so far, and they developers have done really well with it. The dark victim/DiD tone is making it painful for me to keep up with, though. It's creepy, and not in a fun-creepy kinda way, but more in the, "that man's been staring at that little girl for far too long" kinda creepy.\n\ni'm still undecided but i'm going to give it a Thumb Up because it is, technically speaking, nicely done and a pleasure to play. It's just the tone and thematic elements i'm having trouble accepting as being something i want to play through.\n\nUpdate: creepy in the extreme. Whoever scripted this is seriously screwed in the head.\n\nUpdate: after the first chapter, the DiD/victim vibe drops off to essentially zero. That's a good thing. After that point (specifically, after existing the factory) It retains much of its abstract weirdness but drops the creepy imagery/theme.","April 7","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Me and My Associate thought it would be funny to purchase one and play the game, no matter how bad it looked. This is the product of that experience, and I have to say that We were very pleasantly surprised.\n\nFrom the outside, this doesn't look like the most appealing game in the world. We thought that it would be kind of naff and a bit dull. The gameplay can be described as straight forward Point and Click Puzzler with Elements of Where's Wally. The art really grows on you and has the same type of charm that you would find in Alice: Madness Returns (It's not only the name that they share in common.)\n\nThe plot isn't the strongest point of this game, but it works as the carriage to help understand the setting and gameplay elements. The gaming formula does become quite tiresome towards the end of Alice's Journey, but there is still fun to be had. I would recommend that you give this game a shot at least once, and We shall be trying out some of the creators other games in the future.\n\nRemember Dear Readers, You heard it here first.
