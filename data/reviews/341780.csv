"http://steamcommunity.com/id/igtbtg/recommended/341780/","igtbtg","PhineasPoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/igtbtg/","1474 products in account","TLDR: This is a 5 GB RPG Maker* game with no mouse  control. Are you still reading? While Episode II is a much better game than the first one, it is still not a good game. In general, the combat and gameplay is extremely boring. Leveling up is now second to the restrictive grid system. So, there is less incentive to battle and for too long battles rely mostly on just hitting "attack." The writing is no longer laughable, but is extremely weak. Characters and situations are poorly developed and when the emotional beats arrive they fall completely flat. It's an extremely ambitious game, but the devs are trying to move too fast for the story to work.\n\nOh, and the game now has "cutscenes," but they usually don't work out of the box. The fix is simple enough, but it should just work. It's an RPG Maker* game.\n\n*To be fair, I guess they use some kind of hybrid of RPG Maker and other things.\n-------------------\n\nI got this game in a bundle, otherwise I would have never picked it up since the first one was so bad. This is a better game, but all the improvements are ruined by new mistakes. I have not completed the game. I usually like to finish one before I leave a review, but. . .it's just too boring. I think about 10 hours, though, I have a pretty good feel for it.\n\nTHIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\n\nFirst, the improvements and what's good: The game looks better. Cities on the world map actually look pretty cool. Character portraits are no longer generated in RP Maker. Dialogue is no longer extremely goofy. Probably the best thing about the game is that it is extremely ambitious. It starts out with you following multiple sets of characters to cover a lot of ground kind of fast. You take control of the "villains" at one point. There's an interesting section where you control ships. There's a lot of effort and a lot of good ideas. There's a new grid system that gives you skills and stat boosts (think Final Fantasy X)\n\nHowever, it all falls short. To begin with, it's extremely boring. The characters splitting up and you controlling different parties means that for the first. . .8 hours or so, you're controlling low-level characters without many skills. Hope you like hammering the "Z" key over and over to spam attack. This is not helped by the grid system, which is the only way to get new abilities. The grid requires orbs (three different kinds). The game is very stingy with the orbs. It's a really artificial way to control difficulty and progression. Leveling up will give you stat increases, but the game won't give you a heal skill until it wants to.\n\nThis makes the game annoying. Where before you grind a little, get some new skills and try a fight again, now it's based more on luck and figuring out what the devs hoped you would do. I'm sure from their viewpoint, this is called strategy. To a certain extent that's true. I'd bring up two things though: JRPGs should always allow a brute force path accessible by grinding. It's just tradition. Second, strategy is not when you pray for critical hits or enemies missing. There were a lot of fights where I knew what to do, but was still at the mercy of the RNG. Also, world map random battles are gone. So, unless you're in a dungeon the option to level up is completely gone, not just less effective. Finally, a huge thing in this game is now long strings of battles. Fight after fight after fight. It's tedious and any enjoyment from the challenge is gone when you have to restart a five fight long series of battles.\n\nSo, since leveling up doesn't help as much as it used to and there's less incentive to do it, random battles are now even less appealing. The devs threw out the one great thing about the original game (the random battle system) in favor of visible enemies. That's fine, they're easy enough to avoid. Except when there's traps. This game is now all about traps. They're everywhere. If there's one thing I love in an RPG Maker game, it's being required to make careful, precise movements. Maybe this is how they justify not having mouse control.\n\nThere is still no mouse control. This game is 5 GB and there is still no mouse control. They still haven't fixed the mute issues where the game doesn't fully mute.\n\nThere's still a ton of writing issues, too. The game is no longer as laugh out loud silly as the first, the dialogue has improved and, as I mentioned, the approach to the plot is very ambitious. It doesn't click, though. First, I originally started playing this game as soon as I finished the first game. However, since none of the characters were memorable, I had no clue who half of the people mentioned were. Second, things are brought up here that were never mentioned before. Gelina is a DRAGON. Now, she was a hidden character in the end game of the first one and if you leveled her up she got a dragon ability. However, I swear to God, her being able to transform into a DRAGON is never established in the main storyline of the first game. Her losing the ability to transform is a big plot point and is supposed to be an emotional moment, but why would we care?\n\nAnd that's really the big problem with the whole story. The writers go for these big emotional beats, but they never work. To get a pay-off, you need to invest time. Why should we care that a city has been destroyed or if a queen dies valiantly? We have no connection with them. At best, the moments just lay there and at worst it's eye-rolling.  The whole plot is based off this epic war that's apparently going very badly for our heroes. We don't really see that, because almost as soon as we take control the tide starts to turn. First rule of writing, the most basic stuff: show don't tell. Make us play through the war going badly. Our heroes can succeed even as things go poorly on a grand scale. Then, at the end, they win.\n\nAccording to the devs, this series is going to contain NINE GAMES. NINE. Why are they moving so fast (aside from, maybe, trying to escape hubris)? Take time to build up the characters, make us care about them. At times, it's amazingly inept. The game starts with Magus getting married to Gelina. At some point, the weird threesome those two had with Magus' former wife dissolved because Magus' wife cheated on him with Magus' sister. . .who, I believe, is Magus from ANOTHER DIMENSION.\n\nWHAT? WHY? These characters whose dialogue with each other was mostly about how much they loved each other. Show us that dissolution. Don't just go, "Oh, hey, CURVE BALL." Because, again, don't care about the characters. This new development, as it is, is just. . .weird, I guess. You're planning for nine games. Take some time, build characters and situations and make us care.\n\nThose are the big issues. The game is boring, the writing, while better, is still extremely lacking from a development and structure perspective. I almost like the first game better. While it was a lot worse, it was worse in a way that was entertaining and I kept playing to see how much worse it could get. This does not have that. This is competent, but bland and unengaging.\n\nEXCEPT, during the opening cutscene, there is a lift from "Nightmare on Elm Street." The rhyme "One, two, Freddy's coming for you" is used, except Freddy is replaced with the main bad guy's name. That's right. In their epic fantasy RPG, they stole from an iconic horror movie. Not even a reference. A reference would be if an NPC said it, if it wasn't overt. This is right out there, in the opening. It's amazing.","May 25, 2015","false","11.7"," 69 of 98 people (70%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","70","69","98","12","14"

Other than I think they go a bit overboard with the characters being "so dark," but it's comical in a way.\n\nSimple, classic-type RPG. It reminds me a lot of FFVI in a way, or the older Suikodens.\n\nA bit more "mature" themes than those games, though?\n\nEveryone from the casual to the hardcore will appreciate it, and the Developer seems to be doing a good job responding to FAQs, which helped me solve a bug I kept getting early in the game.\n\nOverall, underground 8/10 in my opinion. I have not played the first one, but I probably will pick it up after playing this one.","January 29, 2015","true","11.3"," 34 of 50 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","34","50","4","2"

This means the player will get its own party with skills and weapons exactly were devs want, so you'll get in troubles many times to beat some boss because no grinding free time or a bad select party could you put in risk oftenly.\n-Custom facesets for dialogues are helpful (episode 1 was confusing with RPG Maker default style).\n-Your decisions have impact on story, but really for NPC situations (NPC becoming bunny, or cannibalised NPC).\n-Many easter eggs such as developer room.\n-Around 10 hours at beginning you will got your characters split over the world under level 10.\n\nBasically, I recommend this to people who likes RPG Maker games and eager people for turn-RPG. It is not mandatory to play Episode 1 to play this, but you will be really confused by the astonishing number of Lee's family members and its relations each other.\n\nMy spanish review here: http://www.lanif.com/blog/?p=1341","November 28, 2015","true","28.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","10","13","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathrowgamings/recommended/341780/","deathrowgamings","**Death Row**","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathrowgamings/","135 products in account","Continuing the saga of the sinister dark lord of the Kisareth Empire Magus Lee, War of the Abyss was released last week on Desura, and after having been given the green light to release the first game on Steam not long ago, Kisareth are hoping to get the second instalment to the franchise released on Valve’s online gaming service even faster; and after having played it, I can’t see why that would be unreasonable.\nFollowing on from the splendid hand-drawn visuals of the first game, Kisareth have stepped up their game by providing infinitely more detailed scenery, settings, character sprites and enemies. The world in the second game is a lot more open and vast than that of its predecessor, and there is a lot more diversity in the game’s visuals; particularly in its enemy designs. Influences from other sources have been made far less obvious with a lot of the unique enemies that can be found in the game, such as the Abyssal Soldiers and the Scorlanis. As well as there being more effort put into the hand-drawn visuals, the character portraits have also been re-imagined, deviating away from the Japanese anime style used in the last game and making use of a more unique visual style.\n\nThe gameplay remains largely the same; a traditional turn-based RPG reminiscent of the likes of Classic Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest games; and as such, it is wonderfully addictive, immersing and challenging, like its predecessor. The game also throws the player straight into the thick of the action, starting from the battle between Magus and his allies, and the dark god Xe’on, creating an extremely explosive first impression on gamers. The developers have also rethought the level up system by introducing the scion grid, which is used to upgrade character’s weapons and teach them new abilities. It’s somewhat similar to Final Fantasy XIII’s crystarium system, albeit, much less complicated and easier to work with. It’s much more satisfying to level up characters than it was in the previous game, and therefore, more enjoyable to play. Although there are no random encounters, and that enemies instead appear on screen, there is still plenty of room for level grinding and hours of fun gameplay. There is also more to play for throughout the game, as the story splits off into several different directions, giving the player multiple characters to work with intermittently, maintaining variety.\nIn summation Chronicles of a Dark Lord Episode II: War of the Abyss is better than its predecessor, and Kisareth have managed to deliver yet another greatly immersing gaming experience. It’s almost like an extension of the first game, but with much better visuals, more engrossing gameplay and lasting fractionally longer. My biggest hope now is that the next game in the series dwarfs the size of the first and the second combined, as a game series that could potentially be of the same magnitude as either Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, deserves to have a game that lasts as long as a game in the aforementioned examples.","February 24","true","3.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Fantastic visuals, Awesome musical score, challenging combat, and a few fun extras like boat combat and free movement fighting in the arena. Would definitely recommend especially if you enjoyed the first, as basically everything was improved from the first game.\n\nI especially would like to point out that the final boss is not an anti-climactic pushover like you see in some games, as I found myself pulling out all the stops and items I saved throughout the game and still barely managed to beat him(I even did a couple hours of grinding beforehand!) That being said I'd just like to also make clear that the game wasn't too heavy on the grinding levels either so it doesn't get tedious.\n\nI'm really excited to see the DLC for this game and later on more episodes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hunterpbrown/recommended/341780/","hunterpbrown","HunterPBrown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hunterpbrown/","59 products in account","I can honestly say, this game was the perfect definition of nostalgia and old school. After RPG's today have become so complicated that even a strategy guide isn't going to help, this is the kind of throwback that is required in today's setting.\n\nBe prepared, however, that you might want to play the first game before you play this, so you get an understanding of the events of this game, though it won't be completely necessary. The first game is full of humor, and this game takes a turn to the dark side, with dark humor, which is my kind of humor, as well as a more serious tone to the game.\n\nThe game has a strong opening, but unless you're paying attention, you're gonna get confused because, in a similar fasion of Final Fantasy VI, the game splits up the party into groups, each with it's own unique storyline and undertone. Characters do not level up with you, so when you get to another party or group, the levels they had before the split (if any at all) are not up as well. There will be some grinding, however, the Scion Grid system, similar in fasion to Final Fantasy X's Sphere Grid (except each character has their own and you cannot enter anyone elses upon completion) to get your skills and big stat boosts.\n\nI've heard a common complaint that you can't use a mouse to play this game. Why does that even matter, this is an RPG, not a first person shooter or even a third person. The mouse should be for clicking NPCs in a 3D world, not a 2D world. Also I play with an Xbox Controller, so the mouse would be more of an inconvienence if it was implemented into the game. Another common complaint I've read is that it's made in RPG Maker VX...yeah, well, I've seen worse games done in other engines, so using that as an excuse to not play a game is really lame.\n\nThere are a few things that are annoying. One of my biggest pet peaves in any game is the hit detection on some moves. Skills and magic CAN miss in this game, and it will make you cuss in some cases (with me it did).\n\nAs stated before, the game is extremely dark compared to the first, so humor, unless it's messed up like mine, you will not find a lot of it in this game. Also, the storyline, you HAVE to pay attention to it or you will get lost or confused. And word of advice, take notes on locations of towns and people. Yeah, that does sound bad, but in some cases, it'll help you later in the game when you have to backtrack if you need to restock or anything.\n\nOne other annoyance is the missibility of some items as well as a "Point of No Return" situation in some cases. Lots of saves are required in case anything is missed, whether it be a certain item or an achievement. Again, multiple saves are necessary.\n\nOne thing I did enjoy is, like Chrono Trigger, you see the enemies on screen, making it easy to bypass battles if you are injured and need to get to a save crystal or something similar. However, I do not recommend avoiding battles, as you do need to get your levels up to withstand a boss or two, as well as ensuring your HP is good if you hit a trap. Items do restock in the towns as well as new goodies, so pay attention to the on screen text when a character says they shops are restocked.\n\nMoney is also kind of a problem, as there usually requires some grinding to get enough in game gold (steryn) to purchase items, equipment, upgrades, etc. etc. and you will go through it like an archery contest. Not until midway or late in the game (depending on when you do it) will steryn not really become a problem to achieve, and once you get to this point, you can stock up on as many potions and ethers as needed in the shops. Once this is achieved, unless you honestly suck or get bad luck, you'll be ready for anything.\n\nThe graphics are stunning for a 32 bit game, with good detail and in depth colors. The storyline is dark, and if you get emotionally attached to your characters (don't say this doesn't happen to a gamer in any game, if you do, you're not a gamer), you will shed a tear or feel bad or gut wrenched in some cases. The music has some headbanging to it, though the boss music, get ready to get tagged on youtube if you decide to upload your own footage. I do like the title track "Subside" which is an original composition to the game. Very beautiful song, and headbang worthy too.\n\nI played this game directly from Kisareth Studios, so my play time is off by nearly 10 hours, but sticking with the main storyline, the game has over 25 hours of playability, and with the side quests, an additional 10, for a total of around 35 hours. It is well worth it, as well as additional goodies coming soon.\n\nIt's worth it.","June 14, 2015","true","29.6"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"
