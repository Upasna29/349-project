"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seawater/recommended/399260/","seawater","Seawater","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seawater/","2618 products in account","You play a defenseless girl, who gets viciously attacked by every cat she comes across, on a quest to rescue her mother from a strange looking raven all the while collecting gems strewn about for some reason.   It looks ok, sounds ok, animation is ok.  For the most part, it is a generally ok,  mostly generic platformer.\n\nI have a couple problems.   Its feels so very slow.  The character doesnt move very fast to start with, but when she shrinks, her speed becomes a little frustrating.     You also move around on a lot of floating platforms, so you are standing still waiting for the platform to arrive where you want, or waiting for a platform to come to you.\n\nThe biggest issue is just the poor level design.   It has some complexity through branching, which is nice, BUT if you didnt take the right path,  chances are you need to restart the level.  Made it to the final door and missed a key?  No way back up those cliffs you just jumped off.   Took a wrong turn when there were several ways to go?  Well, you stepped on a mushroom and are the wrong size to do anything here and now cant jump far enough to get back.    Very unpleasant having to keep restarting over things you cant plan for.   And that is ultimately why I cannot recommend this.","January 21","false","0.5"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","22","30","0","2"

It doesn't help that Alice moves pretty slowly even in her normal state, and much slower in her small form.\n\nThe game's challenge seems to come from forcing players to constantly restart through trial and error and instant death scattered around in the form of water and stalagmites, while traversing small moving platforms over them.\n\nI know it's only 79 pence but I feel that even that exceptionally low price point isn't worth the frustration I've felt by getting stuck through the level design.","June 5","false","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gamestyle reminds me of older nintendo platformer games such as Super Mario World.\n\nIt features very nice pixel art, risky levels, and a story about a girl whose goal is to save her mom from danger. And better yet--the game is suitable for all ages!\n\nSo far I noticed that there is no save button during levels. This means you have to try not to lose all of your hearts or fall off the map! If such a thing happens, you will automatically have to restart that level. Some may see this as a downside but it is what makes this game such a challenge. Good luck, and have fun playing!\n\nGod bless and best regards,\nEtherealLife","April 24","true","0.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The gimmick of choice is shrinking/growing by jumping on muchrooms, which enables walking under low obstacles but also affects jumping range and walking speed often changing which routes can be accessed. Enemies can't be defeated and players have limited life points that can be restored through pickups. In some zones the exit has to be unlocked by collecting keys or flipping switches.\n\nOne part I am rather confused about is collecting gems -- each level is sprinkled with collectible gems and some are in less obvious or harder to reach locations. However, there seems to be no point to the gems at all! Other than a counter during the level gems are not tracked anywhere - they're not on the level select screen, there are no high-scores either, they're not needed to unlock anything. Feels like these were shoehorned in to pad out the feature list. EDIT: Turns out the game manual explains this (nothing in the game itself though) -- collecting all gems in a level gives a 'Perfect' finish, and finishing all levels perfectly unlocks 'Perfect Mode' in the main menu. All it does is enable level selection, a feature that was patched into the game since launch anyway.\n\nI'm not sure if it's intentional but the game seems to follow the old school of design that has players run around the level flipping switches or collecting keys and having to constantly backtrack to access more areas. It's an easy way to pad out the game length and can get mildly irritating, particularly since failing a jump and dying results in starting the level from the beginning. Also like the games of old the order of actions does matter - gates have to be unlocked and switches flipped in a certain order or players will reach a dead end and have to restart the level. While the lack of hand-holding can be a nice touch it is frustrating since the field of view is small and path choices are pretty much made blind the first time through a level.\n\nThe game uses 'retro' pixel aesthetic which is fairly pleasing to the eye with bright colourful sprites. Animations are satisfying too, so not much to complain about in the visual department.\n\nOverall a decent way to spend an hour or two if you like platformers and are looking for something new.","October 14, 2015","true","2.5"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","4"

It begins simple enough but soon starts to grow more challenging as you move through.\n\nYou can expect to die a lot.  Not like Super Meat Boy a lot, but there is a fair amount of trial and error involved with solving each stage with times when you can't continue due to hitting a dead end because things were done out of order.  I would have liked to see a more exploration friendly approach to the level design, but it's fine for what it is.\n\nI didn't have much trouble collecting gems for perfect runs in each stage as I played through, but I was never really sure if I was maybe leaving any behind or missing some at times.  I think having the number of gems present in a stage along with the number collected displayed (like showing 5/8) would help.\n\nIt wasn't immediately apparent to me how the switches were supposed to be positioned.  At first, I just went and hit all the ones I came across, then I eventually saw they all needed to be set a certain way.  Since they can only be hit once, it would have been helpful to have levers that were set in the correct position marked from red to green to help relay the idea to players.\n\nThese really aren't big issues with the game, just minor suggestions for simple changes that could help improve the experience for the player.\n\nOther elements in the game like platforming and play control didn't feel bad.  Moving never felt too slippery or overly restricted, everything felt the way it should when running and jumping, which was good considering some of the platforming in later levels.  The music was also really nice, I wouldn't mind listening to some of it again outside of playing the game.\n\nYeah, not a bad game.  It's kinda short, but it's also pretty cheap.\n\n....just don't touch the kittens.  They aren't cuddly.","October 19, 2015","true","52.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"
