It's 4th wall humor but it's not in your face all the time which is great. A excellent sound track and well worth the $5 asking price for the game as of now I'm over 7 hours into the game and not bored of it. Controller works fine. The only thing I can think of is bad the game is still glitchy and it's been told in game by the glitch fairy. The only bug I don't like at the moment that the game crashes sometimes right when combat starts outside of that would recommend to save often. Developor has been working hard trying to get rid of the bugs. If you can get through the random crashes I highly recommend this game as is","March 13, 2015","true","14.5"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","33","41","2","0"

(personally :3)\n\nI haven't played an old school RPG for a long time so I thought why not? I was recommended the game by my friend as it was cheap, and one of the groups encouraged the purchase, so shoutout to them people - you know who you are!\n\nThe game hits you with hilarious humour that is present through the beginning to the end. Some people might find it cringy or weird, yet I thought it was perfect as you don't see many games that use humour as a major thing as it's risky - althought you have games such as Deadpool and this that pulled it off greatly. There are inside jokes that reflect upon the developer and her past work which was pretty interesting. The reference to the actual player and the meta aspect was very different and it felt like a breather from the actual game. The characters are very interesting with each and single one differing from one another in order to pick your favourites and to simply not be bored with the same kind of dialogue. Quests are major in RPG's and the ones that are presented in this game are unique, interesting and again - funny. There are areas that differ from another that also have their unique enemies that provide a good fight, along with a decent amount of gold and exp. The new skills that are unlocked are VERY classic such as boosting the ATK of the party, provoking an enemy to hit a specific character, hitting enemies all at once yet with a reduced amount of damage and etc. This is the most basic description of the gameplay, in a nutshell :)\n\nI feel like if someone wants to capture the essence of this game, they need to try to immerse themselves to the fullest by blocking out the real world with a set of headphones and a comfortable seat as you'll be playing this game for a while - as exploration is key to finding cool items but also the achievements that people are desperate to get! This game is really a gem not only for the gameplay. Although this is a small indie title, the Dev's respond to every single question that the community ask regarding the game. The timing is near to instant and the first comment will ALWAYS be from the dev - attempting to sort out the problem whilst being kind at the same time.\n\nBy no means is this game perfect. There are many bugs and problems with this game as it's completely new - but it's slowly developing. The devs release updates that sort out most of the problems and when a new one occurs, they fix it in a flash. It's £0.15 (dunno how many centssss :S), you're not loosing anything and if you don't like it then oh well, maybe your friend will! But yeah I hope everybody gives this game a shot as it's worth it in my opinion. I've only played around  6 hours and I feel like I'm no where near done!","June 16, 2015","true","6.6"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","1"

Not too pretentious. Not too fan service. Good level of direction while retaining a slightly customizable experience. It's worth more than one playthrough. I lol'd once in a while. The story is well written and paced well enough to keep my interest.\nCons:\nI found the game to be a bit too self referential at times but I appreciate the style of humour. The name is probably the worst thing about this game. I find it a bit uninspired.  Glitch Fairy is both nice to have around and annoying that he exists.\n\nIt's worth the buy if you like rpg games or humour games or are just a fan of anime. The story could easily be a decent anime comedy. Much of the dialogue and personal interactions are standard anime fare. It's not quite on the zany side of farce or on the sardonic side of satire but, somewhere in between.","March 17, 2015","true","11.7"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","18","25","2","0"

K.","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973230221/","3588 products in account","The game has its charme, the characters are fine, the levels have sometimes many details for a 2 D RPG, the sound is good-enough, the story has many parts, to find and see and if you get all achievements you see many points of the game. The game is really positive and some points are funny (really do all achievements, conversations choices, try every single ending).\n\nThere are a few little points i dislike a bit:\n\n1. no german version ( i read some mangas on english but how many new words i get here (over 50 i think, it makes a bit hard that you need to look at dictionary)\n2. the game length could be a bit more\n3. the enemys are fine and the boss in the side quest on the beach are really great, but i miss something like a mega final enemy, there you can test all your items you find, buy and get closer to level 42, but its fine\n4. that some points are closed forever after you finish 1-2 quests (cave Centaur)\n5. it has many good and sad ending but there could be a little bit more inclusive achievements like: Alcohol is more important than a woman or a way to make the bannished witch back home to her brother when she tell the town its in danger or save the city if you tell it the major of Centaur directly, there was a few spots that could be filled too\n\nBut in the end its for me personal a epic game with great love stories and personality, thats because the developer know good quality games of Nintendo, Capcom and Co. and thats why i hope the game get a sequel and give the game a 93 %. Just watch a lets play to see if you could like it too. Thanks for reading/ your time. I hope i help a little bit.","December 17, 2015","true","14.4"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","20","29","0","0"

It does have a tendancy to crash however, usually just as combat is beginning. Save often and youll be alright.\n\nI do have to say however that you are unable to save during a particular quest that has a time limit, and if you need to speed-level up for the final battle it will likely keep crashing. I think this is due to an issue with it not clearing memory, however I am not sure. Despite this this is one of the best rpgs ive played in a ong time. Its also a very affordable price and doesnt take hours to load, which is good.","April 6, 2015","true","12.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Try fighting the ogres on your own at level 8. It's a pain, but fun.\nTHE LIZARD!\n\nCons:\nAreas with lots of mobs are a little laggy with the movement.\nThe crashing (It only happened 3 times to me) is annoying, but you can save anywhere, so it shouldn't be a problem as long as you do as it says and save after every level up and what not. (Mini-Pro)\nNox says she has big boobs, but shes 2D............................ (Anyone that has played for a bit wil understand my sadness)\n\n\nOtherwise I have been enjoying the games humor and RPG aspects. If it's on sale be sure to pick it up, I paid $0.19 for it and I'd gladly pay more now that I've played it a bit.","June 20, 2015","true","4.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Everything is standard to these kinds of games and you go in getting what you expect.  However, this game felt like it was in slow motion, everything was so slow.  Movement didn't seem exactly in sync with the speed I like it at and during combat you always had to wait for a ♥♥♥♥ing bar which was bascially like your attack speed.  That bar made the game ♥♥♥♥♥♥, combat took forever, takes ages to slay a bunch of little rats, just flat out annoying.  The worse part was there was no setting to have "quick combat" so it didn't take forever to grind mobs.  Other than that, the game tries hard to deliver and tries to put elements of humor into it.  Some of it worked, some of it didn't.  On another note, the game was quite linear in the sense that side characters pretty much didn't do ♥♥♥♥.

The characters are great, and can be funny, but the plot is nonexistant. Granted, I haven't finished the game, so I'm not really holding that against it too much in my judgement... but it still bothers me I'm five hours in and the plot of the game is "do sidequests!" If that's the plot, that's fine... but I still don't like it.\n\nGameplay, is also extremely average. It's your basic JRPG battle system, but not interesting at all. This cheap, rpgmaker niche that has appeared on Steam has shown it can have interesting battles... just look at a game like Cubicle Quest. In that game, you basically must figure out what the foes weakness is, and rearange your party to combat it. But in this, the all your party members basically fit into two categories: those who spam basic attacks, and those who spam their strongest spell. Weaknesses and resistances don't really fit in much, since they only affect the latter group, and even then, if you have a tier two level spell that is resisted by the foe, it will do more than a tier one level spell that has an elemental advantage.\nPlus, the inclusion of MP is useless in this game. Your MP pool is so big, and you level up so fast, you never run out of it, so there's no point.\nOh, theres also this half-a$$ (did I mention that instead of swearing the game just puts symbols in? Because they do that, and it makes me think their target audience was nine year olds) active time battle system which seems like its probably a public script you can find on the rpgmaker forums. It's useless, too, since your characters are going to move in a certain order anyway. All it does is add breaks in the gameplay.\nBut I can excuse this, because I love myself an average jrpg, sort of turn based battle system.\n\nBut functionality just flops. I inlcude graphics and audio in this... and they both suck. Basic rpgmaker graphics, which, while not gamebreaking, do stop me from saying "Daaaaaaang this place looks nice" or "holy crap this battle theme sounds great." But I can excuse this.\nWhat I can't excuse are the glitches. There are quite a few, and while most are pointed out by the "Glitch Fairy", and you're shown how to avoid them, there's one that is consistent and not pointed out: the fact that, for some unknown, god-forsaken reason, certain battles will crash your game. You will lose all your unsaved progress. But it's okay, right, because they just tell you to save every three seconds, and promise to fix it in the remake on the new version of RPGmaker. (spoiler: it's not okay.)\n\nTheres also the price. 5 dollars. That's absurd. This game is worth 2.50 at best. So I don't recomend this, unless its on sale for half off or more. But that's fine. Because when it goes on sale, they usually put it on super sale (I got it for less than a quarter of a dollar).","December 20, 2015","false","6.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

If this remains true, the ALBINO HUNTER registers as perhaps, the most lazy and uninspired RPG Maker game I have ever encountered.  While story is prominent, and none too bad, the actual mechanics are horrid.\n\nControls were via 360 Controller, and were terribly unresponsive; especially when tasked with speaking to someone.  Dreadful...\n\nNo interactive elements in the environment; those you would think to offer riches were met with a repetitive phrase no matter your location.  All crates, "This crate is heavy"...etc.  "Logs have insects" or some other nonsense.  The story seemed great, but it went from zero to nowhere fast; bugs kicking me out during a fight....  the capper was having to sit through APG regeneration at EVERY attack, bringing combat to a boring standstill...\n\nWhile I support the RPG Maker community wholeheartedly, it is truly sad that such a half-♥♥♥♥♥ effort would be introduced under that tag.  There is little gameplay, and virtually no passion introduced as a game element, other than a cool introductory story.  I was with you at the beginning...too bad you couldn't deliver the game to meet the story.","December 5, 2015","false","0.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

World is small and backtracking is quite frequent but at the end it starts to feel like a home territory which I also consider a plus. With no random battles it is quite possible to sneak thorugh the territories and some of the monsters are not aggressive which is a good addition to a usual formula. Battles are quite predictable but difficulty curve is reasonable, although on lower difficulty I've finished boss battle on level 29 on main character and about 25 on everybody else, and didn't see higher level abilities. Some difficult monsters don't regenerate which is, again, a good anti-frustrating feature.\n\nFrustrating features are mostly related to speech redundancy: for example, if you didn't win boss fight you'd have to sit through long, slow moving final cutscene again; the vendor on beach has to have... that... pause... every time he offers you a rest, which is very frustrating if you go for dream challenges and have to rest often; Vivian stuck on her long dialog etc. Some sidelines (such as Smith and Priscilla; Helga's father) didn't trigger in my playthrough. Some items in shops are redundant as good gear can be found in wilderness or easily earned. I couldn't find how to dismiss one of companions (Quinta) either. Although the dash is present (L.Shift) there is no auto-dash function.\n\nThe main drawback for me is a multiple references to other creations from author and fourth wall breaking. They are not badly written and sometimes funny but I feel that due to sheer amount of them the world didn't have a chance to truly reveal itself. The ending also felt rushed: I finished with impression that much was left unresolved (to visit the other drow village, to brocker peace, to see Lazarus' and Vivian's marriage (or a loud lack of such)), to go to Great Beyond. It was a good story but it did feel prematurely cut just as it started to really flow.  I wish it was longer or there was a second part.","August 15, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great game.\nNow It does have a major bug, one that is being addressed hopefully in a updating coming soon which is unless you save often this game will ♥♥♥♥ you off. Specifically for me after every 5th fight the 6th fight will crash the game. To me this didn't ruin my experiance it was just slightly bothersome.\nThe storyline is amazing, and I kinda hope there is either dlc or a part 2 created at somepoint because I'd buy it lol. It is witty and breaks the 4th wall quite a bit which was rather funny to me especially since the main character comments on them breaking the 4th wall and gets confused.\nI feel like while the storyline completely justifies buying this game that it still has a couple issues. Two of the characters that you get later on to me feel pointless other than for 1-2 quests that you use them for I found I never actually played or level'd them at all.\nThe repeated comments about monsters is slightly humours as first but quickly becomes slighly annoying hearing for the 100th time that there is another world where bats aren't evil or etc for other monsters. Granted that is just being picky and probably because I grinded way too much lol.\nYou don't seem to need to grind, max level suggested is 30 in the storyline which you can reach quickly and in one quest powerlevel all your characters up quickly.\nAll in all the items, spells, monsters, cast, characters, plots, quests are all excellent, and I did enjoy the tense moments of running around trying to get the legendary weapons on those pesky timed quests.\nOh and I don't know if it's mentioned on the store page, but it does have many mutiple endings some of which can end the game quite a bit early, thankfully the main character will usually make a comment like "I should SAVE right about now" so you can do a single run through and get most of the endings.\nSo go out and buy it, it's worth your money.","January 4","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed playing through once, and will play through again to knock out any achievements I missed first time around. I thought it was fun and well thought out.

It was fun and the characters were engaging. However, I will say it was easy and short. And I felt this game was part of a much greater fan-fiction I'd never heard of before.

Great game.\nNow It does have a major bug, one that is being addressed hopefully in a updating coming soon which is unless you save often this game will ♥♥♥♥ you off. Specifically for me after every 5th fight the 6th fight will crash the game. To me this didn't ruin my experiance it was just slightly bothersome.\nThe storyline is amazing, and I kinda hope there is either dlc or a part 2 created at somepoint because I'd buy it lol. It is witty and breaks the 4th wall quite a bit which was rather funny to me especially since the main character comments on them breaking the 4th wall and gets confused.\nI feel like while the storyline completely justifies buying this game that it still has a couple issues. Two of the characters that you get later on to me feel pointless other than for 1-2 quests that you use them for I found I never actually played or level'd them at all.\nThe repeated comments about monsters is slightly humours as first but quickly becomes slighly annoying hearing for the 100th time that there is another world where bats aren't evil or etc for other monsters. Granted that is just being picky and probably because I grinded way too much lol.\nYou don't seem to need to grind, max level suggested is 30 in the storyline which you can reach quickly and in one quest powerlevel all your characters up quickly.\nAll in all the items, spells, monsters, cast, characters, plots, quests are all excellent, and I did enjoy the tense moments of running around trying to get the legendary weapons on those pesky timed quests.\nOh and I don't know if it's mentioned on the store page, but it does have many mutiple endings some of which can end the game quite a bit early, thankfully the main character will usually make a comment like "I should SAVE right about now" so you can do a single run through and get most of the endings.\nSo go out and buy it, it's worth your money.","January 4","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are pretty funny achievments too and 5 playable charackters to choose for your party, if you had unlocked them. There is not a big story, just a few little ones in a row and some nice side-stories. For the cheap price i really recommend this game!\n","May 24","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
