It's worthy of serious consideration by everyone who loves sim racing. Don't be fooled by the many bad reviews, there's a good reason for them, which I'll explain later. There's also more good news later.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/itBXrA2QEEM\nhttp://youtu.be/I7URfx-CpwE\nRaceroom offers a large collection of cars (75 in total) and tracks (25 in total, many of which have several different layouts) and 3 competitions (2 DTM and ADAC) which are called "Experiences". These Experiences give you full seasons with teams and drivers. In short, there's a lot of variety in this game.\n\nI haven't put many hours into this game yet, but so far I've found the racing "experience" to be extremely good. Physics are very realistic and the AI seems pretty good too. One very nice feature is the ARI (Adapative Racing Intelligence) which adjusts the difficulty level automatically to match your skill and experience. At first I wasn't impressed with this since the AI drivers were driving too slowly, but apparently the difficulty level starts low and increases over time. After a few races the AI had adapted to my level and started to provide some decent competition without being overly difficult to beat.\n\nThere are three racing modes; Novice, Amateur and Get Real. Novice is a bit of a joke since it actually brakes for you as you approach the corners. Amateur has realistic physics, but with traction control, ABS and zero damage. Get Real turns the driving aids off (but damage is still optional). It's a pity I couldn't configure all these things separately, I'd like to have driven on Amateur level but with damage turned on for example.\n\nNow the bad news...\n\nMany people have criticised this game for being free to play but with very little content. That's true, but what do you expect for free? You get 5 different cars and 3 tracks (each with several variations), more than enough to evaluate the quality of the game and give you some great racing fun for no more than the price of the download.\n\nThink of it this way, the "free to play" game is just a demo, the REAL game is in the addon packs. Three of the DLCs currently available on Steam are "Experiences" - full seasons with tracks and cars - DTM 2013 and 2014, ADAC 2014. It actually makes more sense to buy these as DLCs rather than buying a whole new game every year, as with the F1 games. The fourth DLC is just a car pack, not an "Experience".\n\nHere's where the problems begin...\n\nThe three Experience DLCs contain a lot of duplicate content. They mostly use the same tracks and some of the same cars. For example, the two DTM packs only have 1 track and 1 car different. This makes buying all the DLCs a waste of money, because you're paying for mostly the same content that you've already bought.\n\nTo confuse matters even more, there are many more packs you can buy that aren't available as Steam DLCs, as well as individual cars and tracks, some of which are not available in any packs. You can buy them in-game or from their website. These are bought using the in-game currency of vRP points, so you can't see what they cost in real money. However, if you add the items to your cart you can see the cost.\n\nI created a spreadsheet to show what's available in each pack, which you may find helpful;\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=445609150\nWhoever came up with this ridiculous marketing/sales model should be fired. It confuses buyers and can result in wasted money buying duplicate content. Judging by the number of negative reviews, this has backfired on them, which is a pity. I hope they don't go bankrupt again because of this!\n\nFortunately, there is some good news...\n\nWhile experimenting with adding various packs to the cart on their website, I discovered that they DON'T CHARGE FOR DUPLICATE CONTENT! They know what cars and tracks you own, so you don't pay extra for what you already have. So if you already own DTM 2013, DTM 2014 will be cheaper as a result. I wanted to buy all the tracks but was loathe to buy the European Track Pack for just one extra track, but when I added it to my cart, it cost less than a pound extra, less than half the price of buying that track individually!\n\nSo, it's okay to buy ONE Experience pack from Steam, but if you want any more, buy them from their site instead. Also, don't worry about duplicate content, you won't be charged for it.\n\nEven more good news, the more packs you buy at one time, the cheaper they get. There's a cumulative discount, so if you're going to buy any packs, buy as many as you can afford to save more money. I bought 7 items and got a 16% discount. If you buy all the packs I think you get a discount of around 30%\n\nTo give you an idea of cost, I spent less than £30 to get all the tracks and about a third of the cars. I could have gotten all of the tracks cheaper than that, but I wanted some extra cars as well. Two tracks are not contained in any pack. Buying all the packs would cost around £70 I think, but unless you're a collector who has to have everything, it doesn't need to cost that much.\n\nCONCLUSION: I highly recommend this game to all sim racers. Those who prefer casual or arcade racing should probably avoid this game (but by all means try the "demo" first). The DLCs, packs and points method of selling this game is overly complex and confusing, but if you like this game, don't be put off by that, it's well worth the hassle, and it's much cheaper to buy the extras direct from the game or their website, NOT FROM STEAM!","May 23, 2015","true","30.3"," 427 of 471 people (91%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","91","427","471","26","18"

First off this game has no single player content like previous Simbin entries save for track test and time attacks.  Next there is no multiplayer save for special promotional challenges and time attacks against another player's ghost car.  Another thing is the sheer cost to have content equal to the legacy titles from Simbin as you will spend $100+ USD just on cars and tracks alone without even factoring in the cost of liveries of the cars purchased.\n\nThe positive points of this title is that the car audio is a step up from previous entries as the Zonda R sounds better than the GT Power pack version as an example.  Another plus is that the car models are also a step up from the previous entry as they look much more detailed.  Finally the physics are another step up as the cars feel a bit more responsive and can actually tell you when they will let go.\n\nUnfortunately the cons are far too glaring to overlook and for now I'll have to say avoid this title as there are other titles that offer more content for your money.","December 3, 2013","false","67.1"," 214 of 282 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","214","282","2","1"

I race with a Logitech Momo wheel and triple 1920x1200 monitors with a nVidia GTX680.\n\nThis is the best racing simulation at the moment because:\n\n1. Realistic physics\n2. Excellent sound\n3. Excellent force feedback\n4. Plenty of cars to choose from - I recommend purchasing at least one of the following Experience packs: DTM2015+, ADAC GT Masters 201x so you get a good set of cars/tracks and then add DTM1992 and Group 5 packs later.  WTCC2014 is also very good but if you don't know how FWD cars drive at the limit, test drive them first.\n5. Single player has the Experiences, Custom Championships, Competitions and Leaderboard challenges to keep things interesting.\n6. Multiplayer has dedicated server and allows for large fields.  Of course who you race with determines if it's fun or not.  For the most part the online racing is pretty good and active during the mornings in North America and during the evenings in Europe.  Do not use the free-content races as a gauge on whether the racing is any good. I avoid free-content races.\n\nTo get the best deal when starting:\n\n1. Grab a vRP package from the online store: http://www.raceroomstore.com.  You will get a code to redeem in the Store portion of the game.  Click the [v] button beside the vRP amount then Redeem Code.\n2. You get discounts when new packs have tracks/cars you've already purchased or if you purchase more than one item at a time (bulk discount).  For example DTM2015 only cost around $10 USD if you already have DTM2013 or DTM2014","October 24, 2015","true","640.2"," 125 of 157 people (80%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","80","125","157","15","8"

No longer a featureless hot-lapper as it was in the first early years, R3E has experienced a turn-of-direction toward a proper racing simulation. Developers Sector3 -formerly Simbin - are trying to build a simulation worthy of its forebears - the GTR and RACE series. R3E is steadily but surely becoming what we all hoped GTR3 would be. It's still got some way to go and many core features are yet to be implemented, but R3E is on the right path.\n\nR3E has a good mix of approachability and realism. There is something here for casual racers and simulation enthusiats alike. Content is focused on purpose-built race cars, predominantly touring cars and GT racing (with open-wheel and endurance content to come), and in this field R3E is peerless. If you want road cars and supercars as per Gran Turismo and Forza it's best to look elsewhere. Track content is also exceptional both in number and quality. Online racing is pretty stable and offline features pretty decent AI with an adaptive feature that matches the CPU controlled cars to the player's pace for a good challenge every time. The real highlight of R3E is the audio - it's the benchmark, as simple as that. I cannot be understated how much good sound adds to the immersion of a racing sim. Sector3 clearly understand this. It's brilliant,\n\nA little more on the 'free-to-play' aspect - it's not really F2P in the traditional sense. There is a very small selection of free cars and tracks with almost no scope to unlock new content or credits by playing, although parts of the game can be played for free such as hot-lap competitions. It's a modular game where the user can buy exactly the content they like rather than paying for a whole game or DLC packs. I think it works well.\n\nTo summarise, R3E is something of a hidden-gem, worthy of any sim-racer's time. It's a project that's only going to get better. It's certainly my go-to sim.","October 8, 2015","true","434.0"," 59 of 70 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","59","70","2","2"

Have GTX 980 ti 6GB so the graphics are really good when maxed out and with fps ranging from 150-160 fps there is nothing to complain about. Also with a huge muticlass grid (99 cars i think) and bmw M6 GT3 (coming very soon), R3E is a must buy for any simracers out there. GTO and formula junior were just released and bmw m6 gt3 coming soon what else would one ask for. And yeah any car can be test driven before buying. Is there any other game that offers this?","April 22","true","10.4"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","3"

I think this was when most of the Sim Racer tried the game and never touched it again. BUT over the last 12 Month the Game became a very solid, very pretty, INCREDIBLY GOOD sounding and very immersive Racing Experience with a nice selection of Tracks and an AMAZING variety of Cars. Sure if you want to own every track and every single car it can be kind of expensive, but look out for Deals (Easter Special 50% off, Black Friday All-in-One 49€ etc) and/or buy the vRP directly on the RaceRoom Store and its a lot cheaper. Also you only need 1 car (~€2,99,-) of a class (GT3 for example) in order to race against the whole field of ATM 13 different GT3 cars. Not like Assetto Corsa where you need every single car pack !\nThe Online Eperience is still a bit ruff around the edges, but the very small Developer Team works hard, fixes regulary and keeps adding new features. They also keep updating older cars to lift them to the latest physics models which I really appreciate.\nEvery time I play R3E it puts a big smile on my face in a most positive way !","May 4","true","77.9"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","33","39","0","0"

You'll have to spend well in advance of £50 to enjoy most of what this game has to offer and while that in itself is not much of an issue, the fact the server framework seems totally unreliable means you'll be sitting around twiddling your thumbs a lot of the time.\n\nSometimes the game won't work, sometimes it will. Your friend just down the road from you may be tearing his hair out because he can't get the game started after the latest patch, though it could be you doing the very same the following week while his game miraculously comes back to life. Throw in the Diablo III-style 'always connectedness' (where you simply have to be connected to their servers even for single player games) and what you have is a game that can be thoroughly frustrating.","February 16, 2015","false","5.6"," 147 of 230 people (64%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","64","147","230","14","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mograph/recommended/211500/","Mograph","[REVS] Mograph","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mograph/","191 products in account","I rarely write reviews for games but I feel the developers deserve one for this game. When R3E launched it wasn't that great - it wasn't bad but it was missing something, it didn't feel quite right and I could never get into it, but I did see some potential.  It was free so whatever.\n\nAs time went on Sector3/Simbin kept updating the game adding content and listening to feedback and things started to get a bit better, but still, I couldn't get into it - Until recently that is.\n\nSince December 2014 when a big patch was released R3E has gone from "Best of the Rest" of racing simulators to a genuine contender. The driving physics are now really rather good, the cars feel nice to drive and they all do what you expect them to do. The sounds are second to none. Force feedback has improved dramatically, you can feel bumps in the road and can tell how much grip you have, even to the point where I can tell which wheel is losing grip. There are lots of options to tweak the FFB to your liking, but some of the sliders are a little confusing and there isn't much of a descriptions for what they actually do. Thankfully out of the box my Driving Force GT wheel felt good - I upped the strength and set a few options that I like to have just as personal preference but it didn't require much tweaking to get it to feel how I wanted it to.\n\nThe AI, although not prefect is pretty good. They drive fair, will try to overtake you if they are faster, will try to defend if you are quicker, sometimes they make mistakes and will out-brake themselves or run wide. You'll see them squabble for position with each other. Rfactor 2 and GSCE probably have the most realistic AI, but the AI in R3E is not far behind.\n\nThe Graphics are really quite good cars look realistic tracks are very detailed and look great, smoke and dust effects hang around in the air for a while and are nice and smooth. The lighting is very well done and there are several times of day to choose from. Driving under trees you get flashes of sunlight lighting up the cockpit and glinting off other cars. It all looks very good and add to what is already quite an immersive experience. Some of the older cars look a little dated (older as in released in 2013) but the newer stuff looks really good. It is is a great looking sim.\n\nThere is a lot of content to be had here ~65 cars and 20 tracks (48 layouts). It isn't cheap, at the moment to buy EVERYTHING it would cost around £130, But compared to something like iRacing where to buy everything will cost you probably 5X as much plus the subscription as well it is very well priced. In both games you don't need to buy everything anyway. Once you've got the tracks you want then you should be all set and with the discounts you get when buying packs you can get most of the tracks for a really good price, plus if you already bought content that is in a pack then it gets discounted automatically for you so you never end up having to pay for anything twice.\n\nYou can test drive any car as much as you like, and there are competitions to win prizes and they often dot require you to own the content to enter. just choose the competition and click GO, you can win virtual money in some of the competitions as well as simracing gear.\n\nIf I have one gripe with the store, it is that if you've bought a car from one of the "Experiences" the adac GT Experience for example, then you have to buy skins in order to race those cars in other series - which is annoying and confusing. I already own the Audi R8 LMS Ultra and I want to race that car in a custom race then I have to pay an extra 79vrp to get a skin to make that car work. I shouldn't have to buy a skin to convert a car from one class to another. To be fair a skin is like 50p to buy so its not lots of money, but it still feels like I've been robbed of my content. talking of Skins, you cannot make custom skins for you cars. - It would be great if They opened up the skins to the community\n\nThe options menu is plentiful and has support for multiple monitors in eyefinity or NV Surround, but you cant change the FOV for the side monitors so you get a bit of distortion to the sides but it not too noticeable when racing. all the keys and buttons are re-mappable and it supports multiple input devices so you can use a variety of controllers all at the same time.\n\nMultiplayer racing at the moment is limited to the Sector 3's own servers and as such is really limited. If you want to run GT cars around a particular track in Multiplayer you cant set up your own server, you just have to hope sector3 have a server set up with that combination, BUT there is a patch coming next week that should add dedicated servers to the game and I'll update this review once they come out and I've had a play on them.\n\nI wouldn't have recommended this game a few months ago. there were far better sims out there to play and without any multiplayer R3E just wasn't quite good enough to put any time into. But now that it has been improved, fixed, fettled and tuned it really is a great racing simulator I imagine when Dedicated Servers are released you should be able to truly enjoy the racing in this game.","May 31, 2015","true","107.9"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","33","40","4","4"

I'm really not a fan of the free to play model or Iracing's subsription and single content purchasing.\nAnd what's sad here is I almost denied myself a fantastic sim because of this. If it werent for the deal I'd not have bothered so hopefully the developers can rethink their pricing structure and offer the content for sale altogether like a regular game.\n\n\nThis really exceeded my expectation. It's honestly hard to describe but something just feels right about driving the cars in R3E. A real must have in any sim racing enthusiast's library!\n\nEdit: Looking through some of the negative reviews here and many of them are just rediculous. Yes, the game's certainly not perfect but giving negative reviews for the fact that the game 'needs' a steering wheel when it's designed as a proper simulation is just stupid. Also saying the game is ♥♥♥♥ because you have to buy cars and tracks again is just stupid. Do people actually think free to play games are free?? I certainly don't agree with how the pricing model works but I certainly dont expect to get things (of any real value) for free...","December 1, 2015","true","9.3"," 35 of 44 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","35","44","5","1"

I just got the WTCC 2013 pack, with 5 cars and 3 tracks for little more then 10euros and there are a lot of content in discount. A great bonus over other racing games where you need to buy cars is that in Raceroom you can try all the cars before you buy them, they let you get a few laps around a track to see if you like it.

The pricing on these addons is quite minimal and you only need to buy what you actually want and when you want it. Oh and you can test drive every car as many times as you like before deciding if you want to buy it.\n\nHere's the rundown:\n\nGraphics 8/10 - they are by no means bad - in fact the sim looks very natural and life like\n\nSound 10/10 - You can't get any more real than this without getting in the actual cars. Every detail from transmission whine and chassis squeaks to wind, transmission flex, gravel and reverb etc.. have been taken into account. The sound alone give this sim more immersion than the competition.\n\nPhysics 9/10 This score was a few points lower a couple months back, but with recent and ongoing enhancements to several group cars and more being fixed currently, R3e is more than deserving of this rating. If they get all the cars to the level they are achieving with the ones they already edited - I see a glorious 10 out of 10 coming in the near future.\n\nFFB 10/10 - for me it was GSCE that held the title for FFB with AC and RF2 following slighly behind, but R3e has taken that title by leaps and bounds. I know this sounds exagerated, but you have to feel it to believe it - and I've never felt this good behind the wheel in my 15+ years of racecraft.\n\nCar Content Variety 8/10 There are tons of cars available - though the list is still a bit on the short side. This is not to say that I don't have enough cars. The fact is I own more than I've had time to drive, but still wish there were a few Group C cars in the mix as those are my absolute favorites. Did I mention that you can test drive every car without buying.\n\nCar Quality 10/10 - This title is on par with AC when it comes to detail. The exterior/interior along with suspension and tires are all done with upmost attention to even the small details.\n\nTrack Content Variety 8/10 Again the amount of tracks are quite limited compared to other titles, but not lacking. Several of my favorite tracks are included (Bathurst, Spa, Nurburgring, RedBull Ring, Suzuka, Nords, etc..) They have also included a lazer scanned Nordschleife into the mix with more lazer scanned tracks to come.\n\nTrack Quality 10/10 Right up there with AC and iRacing when it comes to track surface and detail. The sky boxes are absolutely believable and the environmental details are more than real enough to enjoy.\n\nMultiplayer 8/10 Much better racing experience than most sims I've played, but it still has it's issues. The netcode has been updated recently and seems to be working great, but I have not had enough time with it to give it a better score.\n\nSingleplayer 10/10 The AI have been improved greatly and  their difficulty can be set to adaptive which takes some patience for them to settle in, but when they do they are a joy to race with. Also the "Experiences" make this title a dream when it comes to playing championships.\n\nCommunity 10/10 This is probably the least toxic sim community out there. Most everyone is friendly and helpful. The devs are also very active within the forums and listen to the players.\n\nI'm not sure what all I left out, but I'll be sure to update this in the future.\nAlso: I know this review appears to be written by a fanboy due to the high scores given. I assure you this is not the case. I play many Sims more than I have this. Infact there was a long time which I felt this title was a waste of drive space, but as stated above - it has come a long way.\n\nWhether you're a veteran to racecraft or are a complete newbie, give RaceRoom a try. You have nothing to lose since it can be played for free.","April 30","true","105.4"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","1"

I'd like my review to start on 1 aspect that has taken a lot of criticism, and that is price.\n\nHere is my experience:\nI bought £25 worth of vRP's (the ingame currency) and with it purchased the following:\n90% of the tracks, DTM '13 pack, and a car from most of the other classes.\n\nI have yet to see a multiplayer game i can't join with the content I own and I have countless hours of entertainment ahead of me with the custom championships I can make with all the different classes.\n\nAll of this with £25 which compares very favourably with other sims out there.  So I absolutely disagree with criticism that it is too expensive, you just need to be smart with how you buy.  (A quick note with how to get discounts, is you must always buy 1 pack at a time, to see the discount for duplicate content reflected in the next pack you buy).\n\nOn the subject of gameplay, as i say it's amazing, the FFB is powerful and very informative, at the same level (or better) than RF2's FFB which is regarded as the holy grail of FFB).  Physics feel very realistic the cars feel controllable, you don't feel like you're gonna die on every corner which some sims do.  The tires have a grippiness that is lacking in other sims and when you push them over the limit, you can feel (and hear) them fighting for grip whilst still being controllable in a drift.  Drifting the 4wd cars is an absolute blast!  The sounds are absolutely industry leading and the sense of immersion is just incredible.  Put it this way, once you play RRE, you realise there is more to sim racing audio than just engine noise and tire squeal. (and some don't even do those very well)\n\nMultiplayer is a big positive too, you can always find a game running and i really like how it is implemented. Players may only join in practise and quali sessions which means you don't have randoms coming in the middle of a race and wrecking you intentionally or not because they don't really care about the current session.  Anyone in a  race has skin in the game and I've yet to see anyone driving in a careless or trolling manner.  Another great thing is the netcode is really good as well as the fact that contacts are handled well. In Assetto corsa for example, if you scrape some paint off someones car, the car will behave like it's been blown up by hand grenade!  Not here, contacts are handled in a  realistic and believable manner and makes close racing much more enjoyable and competitive.\n\nSo go ahead and try the free content, I have no doubt once you do, you will be heading straight to the store page for your first pack!","June 15, 2015","true","119.9"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

I play on an SLI EVGA 780 system and get wonderful SLI performance of 95% per GPU usage and the FPS never dips below an enjoyable level on surround (3 monitors).\nThe tracks are layed out similar to other racing games but in comparason to GT5 or GT6, Grid Autosport and the like you get a feel of taking a corner and fluffing the apex, braking too late or just destroying your engine with a lap in 1st gear if you enjoy playing realistic.  Did I mention the SOUND!  Graphical quality is top notice so learn the keyboard setting to adjust your seat height, distance from the wheel etc to suit your driving style.  The AI is hard when you start and since I am still only 10 p[us hours into practicing, they just zoom passed me like I am stuck with the handbrake on.  Did I mention the SOUND!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ark_hiver/recommended/211500/","ark_hiver","Ark|Hiver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ark_hiver/","321 products in account","In short: RaceRoom Racing experience is a great racing simulator to those looking for cut-throat competitive AI in offline racing. The multiplayer is shaping up to be great, but in its current Alpha state it's not quite there yet. If you're on the fence, try the free content first and if you're looking to spend a few bucks, consider either DTM '92, ADAC GT Masters 2013 or 14, or the WTCC '13 pack. Money well spent.\nLook below the review for a comprehensive list of Pro's and Con's after the verdict.\n\nVisually R3E is a competitive title, on par with Assetto Corsa. Track textures and detail are what you expect them to be in a 2014 racing sim. Everything looks quite sharp and well detailed. Car interiors are nicely modelled as well, leaving only very few wishes to be desired. A few upcoming titles might look a bit better, but we'll see to those as they get released.\nLigthing, color and saturation in R3E seem very life-like and real. Lighting conditions can be selected from one of 5 presets: Sunrise, Morning, Noon, Evening and Sunset, with full real-time transitions coming later down the road.\n\nIn the Sound department, R3E really starts to shine. Or roar.\nCompared to other simulation titles like Assetto Corsa, Game Stock Car Extreme and rFactor2, the cars and engines in R3E sound like they have the punch they claim to have. The sound has just the right amount of reverb to immerse you and make you think you are sitting in fact inside of the car you are pretending to be driving at your PC.\n\nOn the driving side of thins, there is a lot of good to report as well: The physics feel similiar to other hardcore racing sims like rF2 or GSCE. It becomes immediately apparent whenever you push the car too hard, resulting in oversteer and overshooting a corner or massive oversteer and spinning out - or if you are lucky - just a major slide of the ideal racing line.\nThe game does communicate what is going on under your car really well through the Force Feedback. With a little practice you can judge pretty well just by feel if you are about to lose the rear of the car, or whether your rear tyres have just locked up. This is really important in a racing sim, and in this regard R3E is comparable to Assetto Corsa and Game StockCar Extreme, but still a little off from rFactor2. To be fair, the FFB in rF2 is unmatched by any other sim.\n\nIf you're not up for racing against other people over the internet, R3E's AI will give you a good challenge. They can be either set to a fixed difficulty level (from 80 to 120%) or alternatively to Adaptive AI, which will ramp up or soften the difficulty depending on how well you do against the AI. In general, Adaptive AI is pretty good at giving you just the right challenge. You have to work really hard for a Victory, but at the same time the AI don't leave you in the dust and you always have some other cars to race against.\nIn their general behaviour the AI race hard against you, but fair. They don't bump you out of the way, but they will use gaps to overtake. They will defend their position with defensive lines and not just stick to a single racing line. (I'm looking at you there, Gran Turismo.) In comparision to Assetto Corsa, the AI in R3E is more aggressive, but still fair.\nUnfortunately the game is missing an AI agression control, like rFactor2 and Game StockCar Extreme have. I'd like to tweak the AI not just in skill, but also in agression.\n\nNow, some time for Multiplayer! There are no dedicated servers available yet, so you have to hope that your favorite track/car combination is currently running on a server hosted by Sector3 studios. The servers are "jump in and drive", meaning that if you don't pay attention you might end on a server that has just finished Qualifying and you start a race from the back of the grid. Netcode in Multiplayer is really solid. No cars warping around, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t contacts and bumps between cars that are 2 meters apart on screen. The community is okay, you get the occasional idiot who wrecks half the field and other people rage quit whenever they lose too many positions for their tastes, but additional features like ranking systems and wrecker bans are on the horizon for the Multiplayer, as well as Dedicated Servers for everyone.\n\nNow for the most controversial part about this simulator: The Store & The Pricing: Out of the box you have access to two circuit tracks, a hillclimb track and a bunch of cars from different classes. In my opinion that's decent content for a free portion of a game. Some people might disagree, but everyone is entitled to their opinion I guess.\n\nTracks and Cars can be bought with Virtual Race Points or vRP, and after the latest update with hard earned cash directly. This alleviates my previous criticism about having to essentially give Sector3 free money in exchange for virtual currency.\nPrices are not that cheap, but they are reasonable. A new car or track will generally set you back 2€ to 4€. You can get bigger discounts if you buy more stuff in bulk, or if you get stuff in packs: The DTM '92 pack with it's 5 cars and a ton of liveries is  ~10€ compared to ~18€ when you buy them all individually.\nAdditional discounts are granted to everyone who owns cars and tracks of a new pack: For example, I get a huge discount on ADAC GT Masters 2014 pack, because I already own most of the tracks and cars in R3E already. I think that's a fair system.\n\nThere is an option to Test Drive all the cars on the RaceRoom Raceway that is included in the game. You can also take part in the free competitions that are changing regularly. Those competitions feature a rotating set of cars and tracks. You don't have to own them to drive them, and if you're fast you might even win a prize!\n\nRecommendations for your first purchase(s):\n* DTM '92 pack (5 cars with a lot of liveries)\n* DTM Experience 2013 (3 cars, ton of liveries, 9 tracks)\n* WTCC 2013 pack (5 cars, ton of liveries, 3 tracks)\n* ADAC GT Masters 2013 (7 cars, ton of liveries, 6 tracks)\n\nVerdict: If you have tried this sim half a year ago, please do come back and try it again! The driving physics and Force Feedback have been vastly improved, along with the new and fairer store pricing & discount system. R3E drives just as well as Assetto Corsa, rFactor2 and Game StockCar Extreme. It has the best single player AI on the market, apart from GSCE and the largest selection of content (sans Modding) of the currently availlable sims.\n\nPro's\n* Good Graphics\n* Great sounds\n* Very competitive AI\n* Good driving physics and FFB\n\nCon's\n* Multiplayer a bit bare-bones at the moment\n* Game can get expensive if you want to have everything","December 29, 2014","true","115.1"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","18","23","2","0"

RaceRoom is a game for fans of actual racing, people who watch events like DTM, WTCC and GT Masters on TV. If you are not one of these people save yourself some money and buy Rocket League or Dark Souls 3 instead.\n\nR3E is one of the best proper sim racing games around, together with the ISI and Reiza Studio games. The attention that Sector 3 applies to every single car and track impresses me all the time. Being a simulator the game is best enjoyed with a wheel or perhaps a miniwheel racing controller, however I've tried the game with a regular gamepad and keyboard, and the game still plays really well.\n\nTheir business model gives you the basic stuff for free, you then pay for the extra content you want. The prices are reasonable considering how much depth each car offers. The game offers three levels of technical difficulty: arcade, sim-arcade and simulation.\n\nRaceRoom aims for accessibility; anyone with an 'OK' computer can play these games, a philosphy shared by the ISI and Reiza Studio games. This is a different ideology from that of games like Project Cars, which focus on exclusivity, where only a few people, with the latest Nvidia cards and expensive rigs, can get their money's worth of the game.\n","May 7","true","73.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhearMark/recommended/211500/","PhearMark","The Angry Hamster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhearMark/","329 products in account","This game has come leaps and bounds beyond where it used to be. As it stands now, RaceRoom Racing Experience (R3E) is a fantastic sim that is easy to get into and fun while still being realistic and tricky.\n\nThe biggest thing you'll notice immediately compared to other racing titles is the sound. Oh lawdy the sound. No game comes even close to the quality of R3E sounds in every area and best of all they are still regularly updated and improved!\n\nPhysics in R3E is where a lot of the 'purists' will decry it for not being harsh enough, not being mean enough, not punishing you hard enough for mistakes, but I find all of that as a positive not a negative. The physics feel just as tight and clean as the other major racing sim titles without being as punishing as some of the more 'popular' options.\n\nForce Feedback (FFB) has always felt decent in R3E but used to be more of a mixed back for many wheel users. The most recent update addressed this by adjusting the defaults for many common wheels (I use a G27 and it now feels great right away) based on feedback from the community. The results are great and the FFB now needs much less fiddling for the finicky users and feels better than ever on default settings.\n\nContent pricing is usually a big issue for most people, but considering the high quality of the cars and tracks the price they ask is very reasonable. Not to mention the price is lower than some other games with similar pricing models.\n\nAll in all there's no real downside to at least downloading it and trying it as there are free tracks and free cars avaialble for anyone to use along with time trial competitions that run for 1-2 months at a time. You just have to try it! =D","June 11, 2015","true","444.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bulle79/recommended/211500/","bulle79","Bulle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bulle79/","10 products in account","At the moment, racesim fans like me seems to live in a golden Age of Racing-Sims as there are a a few promising Sims are out on the market. To put a name to these Sims we've got Project CARS, Assetto Corsa and this game here - RaceRoom Racing Experience (short name R3E).\nAs I was a member of the WMD-Kickstarter-Project for Project CARS I have played it a lot and followed the development-Progress from nearly beginning since its release. I was always impressed by its visual presentation and the dynamic Wether and time-progress...\nThen there was Assetto Corsa... they started to release an early access-Version and I can't hold to get into it... In the beginning i was a bit disappointed because of the strange behavior of the Force-Feedback. After I tweaked it a bit I had some Fun with it but I don't become the feeling that I always want to play it.\nAnd now coming to RaceRoom Racing Experience... I started playing R3E in the beginning of the open beta-Phase. It was fun in the beginning but only good for hotlapping as other features were in development. After a while Sector 3 opens more and more features and deliver more and more content. So we've got Famous racing Series like ADAC GT-Masters, WTCC, the modern DTM and even the most famous classic DTM from the Year 1992. And that's the point where I got hooked in the Game. Despite the other Games, in R3E i've got the feeling to compete in a Racing-Series known in real live. In the other games the Races feel like a loose mixture of cars out of the game...\nTogether with that R3E offers me the best Force-Feedback and the best Roadfeel of all... Not to forget - the Sound of the Racecars. There isn't any other Racesim out on the market the comes even close to the Sound in R3E. Multiplayer-Races are very great fun with close door to door fights. In the visual aspect - yes it is not that high polished like Project CARS and it has no dynamic weather at the moment, but it is very detailed. Especially the Tracks are very close to the real thing and modeled with a high affinity. There are no unnecessary Trackside-Objects that aren't there at the real track what gave me a more realistic feeling.\nOne of the most important parts of a racesim is the Physics-Model... At that Point R3E at the same level as Assetto Corsa. Together with the better Roadfeel in R3E this game is the winner for me. Project CARS falls back in that point - fun to drive in Project CARS but not more...\nOne negative aspect of R3E is the Business-Model of it. It is called Free-to-Play, what it really is, but only with reduced Content. In F2P you have 5 Free cars and 3 Tracks with 11 Layouts. With this content you can do what ever you want - Multiplayer-Races. Single-Player-Championships, Hotlapping and so on. Together with that, there are always a few Competitions online, in which you are able to drive with Cars and on Tracks you haven't bought before.\nIf you want to buy something, it can get expensive. But there are a few Tricks to get it in an acceptable range. So you can buy a Redeem-Code for the ingame-currency "vRP" directly from Raceroom which offer a discount from 10% to 35%. Than you can buy Packs in the store which contains content-objects for a discounted price. The Track-Packs are perfect for that. But you don't have to buy a Car-Pack if you just like one car out of it. Than you can buy that single car and that allows you to drive in Competition or Multiplayer-Races in that Class and other things like that. If you are not sure what to buy, you can always ask at the Sector3-Forum. You will definitely get an answer out of the community - or even from one of the developers. That's another great plus for me, that the Developers are in close contact to the Community and take part in discussions in the Forum.\n\nIn Conclusion I just can say, that R3E maybe isn't the best in every aspect (graphics, busness-model), but overall for me it is the best RacingSim out on the market which hooked me and entertained me a long time now. As it is still in development it will even get better.\n","May 9, 2015","true","680.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

Whats hidden behind the "free to play" aspect is more worthy of a full price because all the content is worth it.\n\nCARS:The cars are all well done and balanced so that there isnt always a dominate car but at the same time true to the real life behaviors. A great variety of racing cars, from power heavy turbo cars of the 70's and 80's to modern GT3 cars to Leman prototypes. Official series are represented, DTM, GT Masters, WTCC and more coming... feel free to test drive them all, buy what you like.\n\nTRACKS:The tracks are well created from scratch to the point you dont care about laser scanned tracks, even though they are just beginning to utilize laser scan technology into there future tracks. The Sim doesnt allow modding, which from my opinion is a bit redundent since the other sims out there allow it but quality wise dont represent well, leaving you wanting more official quality tracks from the developer. With each track released the detail and quality is maintained, not some hack job addon.\n\nMULTIPLAYER: One the best online racing experiences and just getting warmed up. Netcode is very good, even when racing some from the US all the way in Germany, they use a p2p connection, so close racing is possible, being able to squeeze between two cars or riding the back bumper of your opponent is amazing. Currently right now its open servers with rotating tracks, hosting a practice, qualifying and then a short sprint race. In a matter of weeks they will release dedicated servers, allowing any choice of car and track along with many of the standard features.\n\nSINGLEPLAYER: Each official series supports the real life formats. If thats not your thing you can create your own championship, picking your own format and track calendar.\n\nAI: Rated among the best, making a good training tool of racing hard and bumper to bumper, but be aware, be on your A game, otherwise they will punish you. There will be times they run into the back of you but thats usually because you braked too early or took the wrong racing line, so awareness isnt always there top attribute. You can choose a set pace for the AI or choose the adaptive AI and watch there speed grow with you. It isnt perfect but as they move through development, it improves.\n\nSOUNDS: The best, you can ask anyone, even those who race in other sims, all agree RaceRoom has the most immersive detailed sounds currently. They are constantly improving them as well, adding more detail to the car and track ambient. If you dont believe me, check on Youtube and turn up the volume.\n\nGRAPHICS: A very clean and colorful look, with motion blur that actually makes it seem like your going fast. Its improved over the past year and as usual constantly being optimized. The cars definitely fit the tracks in detail, unlike some games where the car or track look better than the other. Partnered with the sounds, its quite the visual experience. Runs well on medium range PC's but does not support SLI or crossfire yet. The game supports different times of day, sunrise to sunset, which looks beatiful across the track.\n\nHARDWARE: They support just about every wheel out there or wheel pedal combinations.\nFORCE FEEDBACK: At a glance the ffb features are overwhelming to tune, but there are many guides and user profiles to build off of. Once you have it tuned its quite a unique feeling, driving the heavy turbo cars is a handful and the modern GT3's handle with weight but finesse. They are always working towards improving the ffb and experience. My advice is patience and try out the various tweaks out there.\n\nFinal thoughts: This is a great hidden Sim that doesnt get the recognition it deserves. Most people dont believe in the free to play aspect and thats understandable, push that asside and you got something great in your hands. I advise to download and test drive the cars your interested in. Price range isnt too expensive, cheaper than iRacing but like I said its worth the price if you were to buy assetto corsa or Project cars. One thing many people miss is the fact once you buy a official series pack, you own the tracks, you no longer have to purchase them in the other packs, your only paying for the cars. My motto is build the game you want, buy the cars and tracks you like and go from there, once you try them you will want them all. Give it a fair try and enjoy the experience.\n\nWith whats ahead content and feature wise, the future is bright, so dont miss out.\n\nHave a look at my Youtube channel to see what RaceRoom Racing Experience is all about.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/224lemans","September 20, 2014","true","463.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Of course this is only true if everybody has a decent internet connection. Even the best netcodes can't fix slow/broken internet :p\n\nEven with only the free content it's a lot of fun but the game encourages you to buy more. The price of the content is okay, not too expensive but not cheap too. Tracks and cars are on sale from time to time and now with the addition of content packs you could get some bargains. I for one don't need any car and track because I have my facourites which I want to drive. Buying them costs less than other sims.

It certainly has taken some time to get here, but the game and its content very, very good.  The recent patch has made a number of much needed updates and optimizations.  The dedicated servers has seen the online community grow, Tracks like Shanghai and Macau and cars like WTCC 2014 have really set this sim apart.\n\nI have no idea how this game has such a low comunity score....well I do, its the F2P model...which really isn't F2P....I would really give it a go, the cars and tracks are some of the best done of all the big sims out there, iRacing, Pcars, AC, imo.\n\nUPDATE 11/01/14----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo I bought a wheel G27, and am really enjoying the game.  Much better with a wheel, although a controller was decent and has some advantages, but it is really not the way to go with a sim.\n\nThe updates that have been done have massively improved the game:  Time of day, updated Force Feedback, track and car physics improved(check to see if which cars and tracks are updated).  It still has a way to go, but is so much better.\n\nThe WTCC cars are a blast.  The ADAC GT cars are big heavy beasts.  DTM is somewhere in the middle.  Once the game gets a championship(pit stops and tires) and MP gets out of Alpha there will be a very, very solid game here.\n\nI would definitely check it out...it is starting to take up a chunk of my life!\n------------------------------\nI am new to "sim" racing games.  Always loved a good race game in my youth (a while ago now), Super Monaco GP, Daytona,  Ridge Racer etc...  I bought Ridge Racer Unbounded for a couple of bucks and forgot how much I enjoyed racing games.  The drifting was so absurd, but it was fun.  I started looking at other types of racing games and saw this one and it was Free to play.  UGHH.  No harm no foul trying a F2P game.  It doesn't cost anything.  I figured I would download the game, play it for a week and then be done with it…\n\nWell fast forward a couple of weeks; I am having a great time.  Using an Xbox controller, this took a long time to calibrate correctly.  It was quite a challenge at first, I like difficult games.  I really want to upgrade to a wheel... but patience!  I don't really understand most people’s complaints with the game, it seems most people/reviews say the game would be really good if this or that was fixed.  A majority were very minor complaints but together resulted in poor reviews.  The core of the game is strong, but there are issues with the game.  I can forgive them at this point since it is still in Beta and I haven't spent a penny on it.  The game has potential to be a LOT of fun as areas are improved and features added, but it will be interesting to see if the studio can get this title to that point - With the restructuring of the studio, hopefully they continue to improve the game at an acceptable pace! :)\n\nOddly this was one time where the F2P model worked in my favor. I can see someone who wants all the goods to be annoyed with this model, but with common sense and waiting for sales you can probably pay for the tracks and cars you want and get out of it with little spent.  If you want it all or a lot, the model fails.  You would think they would offer tracks and cars in packages for a reasonable savings.  Maybe they will change the F2P model a bit to allow for both ways to owning the complete game? I am just waiting for the DTM Experience to go on sale and I will definitely buy it!!!","August 30, 2014","true","811.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Over there, they cost less thanks to the sales.\nThere's 90% of times always one every month soo, you'd better prepare at least 13$ if you want the ADAC GT 2014 for example.\nAnyways! Yeah, the game is indeed nice.

These are mostly because of people's who want all the cars free or because they think\nRaceRoom it's like GranTurismo lol or because of the costs of the DLC's, which i think, it's fair considering if you count them all, you get the price of an AAA+ Complete Sim Racing Game, so it's kind of buying the game but in pieces.\nSo, should you try the game?\nYes, if possbile with a Wheel + Pedals for the best experience but a controller will be nice as well\n\n","May 22","true","9.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","2"

I can't quite put my finger on why.\n\nthe game feels much, much smoother than the other two i've played (Assetto Corsa and Automobilista), i'm yet to give others a go. Along with having a superior sense of speed, I believe the cars handle much closer to their real life counterparts, mainly because i've been behind the wheel of an open wheeler and it bought back a few key memories and feelings.\n\nAnnoyingly, the game is a money pit, but hey, the base game is free and i'd be more than happy to invest on just the GT series and WTCC series, but...

Other tracks also feel solid, Force Feedback seems to be creditable with a nice road feel and tyre lean coming through the wheel nicely.\n\nRaceRoom seems to be the only game to give me a close race all the way through the race, others seem to have the ai drop off a little at stages. My one annoyance with RaceRoom is that I seem to blast the Qualifying 1 or 2 seconds faster than second place but then the ai stick with me through the race, even though my lap times barely drop off from qualifying. Not that i'm complaining, I love bumper to bumper action that the WTCC delivers.\n\nBut from my amature opinion, I'd chose RaceRoom over Assetto Corsa and Automobilista, but only for now, Assetto Corsa seems to be going places fast, especially now there's a console version to push the developers a bit. Automobilista is a fantastic sim too, so ♥♥♥♥ing fun, i've never even heard of the developers but they've done a banging job! As soon as they get their hands on a new graphics engine, things are going to go pretty sweetly for them. I believe they got there's engine from the first version of a very popular racing sim with an insane tyre model. They're sticking with it because they know the engine so well which is fair enough, it does need updating though XD\n\nBut yeah... Add WEC with multi category racing and i'll fall in love with RaceRoom.","April 22","true","21.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

There's lots of it and you can get most or all of it if you get it on sale directly through the in-game store or website for little more than a full-priced game would cost. I payed about 70€ throughout a year and own all but 4 tracks and have access to about every racing class there is (and there's so many). And I could have gotten the same content even cheaper if I waited for some special opportunities.\n\nJust stay away from the packages offered on Steam, they are usually way overpriced. An exception is the new Nürburgring Legends pack. The content, if you don't own anything of it yet, would cost you almost 35 € in the store if you count the single prices for the cars and tracks (which you would normally buy within other packs like GT3, WTCC2015 et cetera where they are also cheaper). Here you can grab it for 15€. With this pack you get two tracks with 7 or 8 layouts, including the Nordschleife, and the cars give you access to about 7 classes I think in which you can participate either in Multiplayer or against AI (AI also uses the cars you don't own yourself). Combine this with the European track pack from the in-game store for example and you already have tons of contents for much less than a full price game would cost you.\n\nApparently the new WTCC 2015 pack on Steam is also quite a good deal if you don't own any of the content yet and prefer to have access to all cars of the 2015 series. It offers a wide variety of tracks with it.\n\nIf you are new to this game, check it out - you get 11 cars and 3 tracks (2 circuits and 1 hillclimb) for free.\n\nThe sounds are second to none, absolutely amazing.\n\nThe Forcefeedback has just gotten a complete overhaul so even if you tried the game at an earlier point already it's worth checking out again. It's great, especially since a lot of classes have also gotten or are about to get a physics update. The new content all have great physics, GT3 also has just been updated. This is of course just my personal taste, but with the new physics and ffb, the driving in this feels a lot better then in Assetto Corsa and PCars anyway.\n\nGraphics are nice, tracks have much detail but the game seems to be relatively demanding. On my old 7950 I have to set shaders to medium to get a minimum of 60fps with more than 20 cars on screen.\n\nSadly, the game is lacking weather effects and night racing.\n\nThe AI however is the best I have ever encountered in a racing game. They give you a good fight, they make mistakes and they usually have a very good player awareness. It often feels like driving against real drivers in MP. Sometimes they are buggy though. A few corners can make them problems depending on with how many cars you're racing and recently they started to take not enough fuel for longer races and some of them go for refueling 1 or two laps before a race ends. But things like this are usually ironed out quickly by the devs.\n\nThe menus are a lot more cleaned up than AC, and a lot more efficiently designed than PCars.\n\nImo, if you don't want to pay a sh*tpile of money for iracing this is the best sim out there atm with a very nice community.","April 25","true","53.7"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

It's also my second one.....\n\nFirst of all, It is a mistake to think RaceRoom is very similar to Project Cars, rFactor or Assetto Corsa. This is what I believed it was trying to do, and was immediately turned off by the lackluster "Free to Play" demo while trying to figure out why they were asking so much for their content which consisted of various "packs" and individual cars with different classes. Your made to feel like you need a second mortgage and a PHD in RaceRoom Economics and therefore, I gave it a bad review with only 0.4 hrs played....However things change sometimes. Once you figure out what you want to start with, the rest will make much more sense. Because I enjoy Racing sims and have a decent gaming rig, I figured I would try it beyond the "Free 2 Play" and purchased a couple of small items and DTM Experience 2014. It was recommended to me by a fellow simmer..Now at this stage, I'm into the game for $22 dollars.\n\nThis is a true "RACING" simulator, what I mean is, it primarily focuses on DTM, ADAC GT Masters series (GT3) and the FIA WTCC Championship. The other attractions are leaderboard competitions and challenges, and actual sponsered competitions from Mercedes AMG. No joke. You also have Hillclimb tracks and GTO cars etc, etc. to play with for just "Fun" racing.\n\nR3E is like the "Gentleman's Club" or the Mercedes Benz S-Class of racing sims.  I understand a little better why the prices are higher than other sims (Except iRacing and your only renting that game) and I no longer have a hatred for the cost of content. The amount of licenses in this game are crazy, If what I hear about the cost of licensing are true, then my guess is Sector3 Studios is shelling out quite a bit, unless I'm missing something.\n\nThe replay cameras are the coolest and the replays are the smoothest! (no stutters or glitch) The sounds are amazing (yes, the rumours are true) The adaptive AI is real fun to race against, (more so than the other sims imo.) and the graphics are excellent which makes RaceRoom's version of the laserscanned Nords arguebly the best in the biz. Anyways, I think R3E is top dog right beside Assetto Corsa, both games compliment each other very nicely. ( AC is my reliable, inexpensive wife, and R3E is my unreliable, high maintenance mistress) rFactor and Pcars will be collecting dust now. Ok, at this stage I'm in it for $125 dollars. Loads of championship races to win and more than enough content to keep me occupied for ages. No regrets. RaceRoom Experience delivers a unique fun factor other sims are missing, which makes it an equal to my other favorite sim Assetto Corsa, but I have to take away a point from it's final grade for it comes with one major drawback....\n\nUnfortunately, in order to play the game you need a constant connection to the RaceRoom servers and internet. No "Offline" mode to be had.  And that, will scare potential enthusiasts away more than the scary pricing model imo..Hopefully they will remedy that in the near future. However that being said, the support from the Official Sector3 Studios forum is fantastic.\n\n9/10","May 19","true","60.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It was perhaps launched too early with many features lacking or functioning badly, but recently, though still in beta, it has really delivered in my opinion.\n\nI also have the "other two" contemporary racing games, AC and pC and I must say that I find R3E most fun of these three. For example, I think BMW M1 Procar is even more fun to drive in R3E than it is in pC which I find a blast in pC also. R3E is not perfect, at least yet, but it surely has its strengths. Sounds are just awesome and with the recent 9GB "patch" they got even better. FFB is also best of the three games and it deliveres the road feel really well and doesn't even require hours of tinkering with settings to get it right. AI is also the most competent of the three by a big margin, so R3E is perhaps the best choice for the single players at least until AC and pC improve their AI algorithms. Graphics are also quite good, although not on par with pCars, but on the other hand, R3E runs also very well on my three monitor setup.\n\nBut hey, physics are the most important thing, no? Here R3E fares also well. Physics aren't perhaps the most accurate on the planet, but still very believable and with awesome FFB I like the driving feel a lot. I say it again, I think R3E delivers the most fun experience of the three. Still, R3E is by no means arcade racer and leans heavily towards simming side of the genre.\n\nAs said and at the time of writing, R3E is still in beta and a work in progress. It is still quite polished and offers pretty much full experience already. It has no weather or full night, but it is otherwise pretty much a full deal IMO. Things I dislike the most are annoying load times, which surely improved with the latest patch, but are still on the annoying side especially on the menus. Micropayment system is completely a matter of opionion and it really doesn't bother me. You can have just one experience set and that gives you several tracks and a class of cars and that's basically all you need. If you wan't more, different packs give good value for money and you get discounts for the packs of the items you already may own.\n\nIf you like sim-like racing games don't hesitate to try the R3E.  You can do it for free, but of course with very limited options for driving.","June 11, 2015","true","139.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I'm giving this a thumbs up only because it's actually a great racing sim experience with excellent single player AI and vehicle physics. Unfortunately you need to always be online to play.\n\nMultiplayer is still hit or miss and sometimes you will get randomly disconnected.\n\nI sincerely hope SInBin/Sector3 change this game to a flat pricing fee if they truely want to entice more players to the game. The game content is always on sale at least 50% on their website (cheaper than steam prices) so I wouldn't worry about missing out on sales. I've never seen any of the packs at full price. For example the regular price for the DTM 2014 pack is 8318 vRP or about $85 US without a discount on their site! Who would pay that much!? The permanent discount price is there to get you to buy stuff and is a classic marketing trick!\n\nIf you're looking to get into Raceroom Experience with minimal cost I recommend the DTM 2013 pack and the American track pack. It only costs about $20 USD and gets you a great race series along with 13 tracks...\n\nCircuit Park Zandvoort\nRed Bull Ring Spielberg\nEuroSpeedway Lausitz\nMoscow Raceway\nHockenheimring\nNürburgring\nNorisring\nMotorsport Arena Oschersleben\nBrands Hatch\nMazda Laguna Seca\nMid Ohio\nIndianapolis\nSonoma Raceway\n\nAfter that things ramp up in price very quickly! It'll cost you $102 USD for all tracks, three different race series and a big variety of vehicles (but not all of them). Detailed below. Keep in mind this still isn't all of the content available, probably around 75% of it!\n\nWTCC 2013\nDTM Experience 2013\nADAC GT Masters Experience 2014\nDTM 1992\nGTR2 Pack\nGroup 5 Pack\nAmerican Track Pack\nTrack: Circuit Zolder\nTrack: Bathurst Circuit\nTrack: Salzburgring\n* All remaining tracks included in above packs\n\n$102.59 USD Order Total (after discounts)\n\nIf you want every vehicle in the game expect to pay well over $150 USD for all content.\n\nMy advice is to just buy the $20 package I listed above and be happy with that. It's the 'best deal/bang for the buck' and still gets you a lot of racing action and tracks for that price.\n","June 3, 2015","true","40.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I have 2 kids and I hardly have time to wipe my ♥♥♥ because I have to wipe theirs.  I also have a stressful full time job.  Because of that, and because my favorite games are racing games, I went on the hunt for a great racing game to use as therapy.\n\nAssetto Corsa:  I tried to like it.  I really did.  But it just wasn't for me.  It's not a complete game, the environments feel dead, it felt slow, there weren't as many tracks as there are in other games, and it just bored me.  I returned it before I took my morning dump.\n\nPCars: This game is sexy af but the the ffb is an afterthought.  I also hated that there is no championship mode available.  In all honestly, it felt like a rushed simcade game.  I did appreciate the graphics and variety of tracks, but the actual driving did not grab my attention.  I didnt feel like I was a race car driver.  The half-♥♥♥♥♥ one player mode, and nearly optionless career mode was very Star Wars Battlefront-esque by Electronic Sharts.  I blame this microwave, insant gratification generation of subhumans for that game and this one for letting developers ravage them in this manner, although battlefront is much worse than PCars.\n\nThis game:  Holy ♥♥♥♥.  The driving in this game is ridiculous.  The driving alone is so intense because of the physics engine and amazing ffb, that within one minute I was sold.  You can feel it when you mess up, and when you're about to.  That makes its so rewarding to run a good race or to recover/prevent a fishtail (which these cars do readily).  The graphics are nice, not PCars level,  but definitely pretty.  The game also runs smoothly on my computer.  I love the presentation and the tracks feel alive, but maybe its because you have to focus so hard to place!  Last but most brilliant is the sound.  My God the sound.  The sound is the icing on the cake of the immersion this game provides.  This game is the truth, and I'll go as far as to say it's my favorite racing game ever.  Also, people talk ♥♥♥♥ about f2p, but this is a reasonable f2p model because they have discounts for bulk purchases and you can save money by buying what you like.  In sum, ♥♥♥♥ the other games.  This game is the real deal.  The only cons for me is you can't set the length of the race by laps, only time (♥♥♥♥ you for that Sector), and the cars do an automatic 1080 if someone bumps you or you lose traction.  It's ♥♥♥♥ing stupid the way these cars spin but I guess you cant be perfect.  But literally, a ♥♥♥♥ing spectator could fart in the stands and you'll go ♥♥♥♥ing carouseling into a hotdog stand and last place.","January 17","true","20.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","10","12","6","0"

Of the two offererings about of late, Project Cars & RRRE, I would hands down take RRRE. What it lacks (only slightly though) in looks it more than makes up for in AI, SOUNDS (!!!!!!) and game mechanics and handling.\n\nThe devs also listen to the community and are patching and or updating/adding all the time with changes to UI, changes to daytime/evening time racing, dedicated servers, create-a-championship (for offline players). New cars and tracks being added all the time, and to a VERY high level. A few of my friends have tried both PCARS and RRRE and have also concluded of the two its the stronger product.\n\nI will say, whether its an issue with AMD or not the game does seem to run slower than PCARS.

So of course it has great driving physics. It feels solid real and you understand why you make a mistake. It's not like NFS where cars behave as if they had plastic wheels and were driving on plastic roads. Your car handles like it should, not like a Hot Wheels car. You put too much gas, you get punished. You brake too hard, you get punished. Just like in real. But once you master a car, it'll be easy for you to set a lap time. A clear, neat interface, great sound work, great driving physics, and very decent graphics. All for free. What's not to like? Too bad its new multiplayer is riddled with crashkids, who presumably be shot to death in real life if they did the same. Simbin also likes to stick their flag notifications in the middle of your screen, blocking the apex when in exterior cam. Other than that, go grab this already. And if you have the money, get the BMW GT2 and Audi R8 LMS, they're top notch cars.","September 12, 2014","true","12.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It is a tad expensive to get all the content compared to other racing titles but if you wait for one of their big sales it's possible to get it all for around 120 dollars (and it's probably worth it for how great the driving is). It still beats the incredible expense of buying content and yearly memberships for iracing though. Crazy amount of money to play that game.\n\nJust want to add that the best way to get content for the game (as others have said) is to buy VRP packages directly from the Raceroom store site (not the game site) then use the VRP when the game has one of their huge sales on. The way I bought content was to buy a couple of the packs when Steam had a really good  sale on first. I then bought a VRP pack and used it on the Raceroom site when they had a 90% sale (they have these great sales a few times a year from what I've seen). Because I owned two of the larger packs already, I also got additional discounts. I managed to get all the packs on the site (except a couple of the single car packs), around 75% of the cars and all the tracks except 5 for around 85 dollars Canadian total. Keep in mind that Raceroom uses US dollars and my dollar was only worth about 72 cents and you see how cheap Raceroom can be if you live in the US. Definitely worth it in my opinion for this incredible sim.","May 8, 2015","true","30.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VettelsFinger/recommended/211500/","VettelsFinger","SebsIndexFinger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VettelsFinger/","58 products in account","This is a sim racing title. Which means you need a wheel to play this game, preferably a Driving Force GT or better. A gamepad will simply not do. If you are looking for something along the lines of DiRT or Need for Speed, this game is definitely not for you.\n\nNow that's out of the way, R3E, in it's current state, is a solid contender in the sim racing genre. Physics feel great and the force feedback is pretty much what you would expect from a racing sim. The game has fantastic sounds and AI that pretty much blows every other modern sims out there out of the water. However, the game does have major flaws which I will talk about further down.\n\nPros\n\nFANTASTIC AI\nIt's pretty much the best out there. Heck, I would even go as far to say that it rivals the old Papyrus sims in terms of AI intellegence and speed. They will not  brake early in the first corner for you to pass every single one of them before the first lap. They will not drive into you because they follow a specific line around the track. You can actually see them race each other and take different lines as you catch them while they slow each other down. They will try to take their position back if you manage to overtake them. You pass someone coming out of a turn and the next thing you'll now, they're back at your side for the upcoming turn. They also sometimes cause accidents of their own which spices things up a little. Overall, it's a nice alternative to public lobby online racing.\n\nGOOD SOUNDS\nProbably the best sounding sim we have, next to the V8 Brazilian Stock Cars of Game Stock Car Extreme IMO. The DTM 1992 pack is probably my favorite. You could hear the car suffering when you damage the transmission, and you could also feel that you are slowing down because of it, which you are.\n\nGood car and track selection\nThere's a decent amount of tracks and cars in this game. No road cars though. Not that it matters much.\n\nNice Graphics\nNot much of a graphics guy, but they do look good. Not as good as Assetto Corsa though.\n\nA great sim for single races\nIt's a no brainer. The AI can provide very challenging races even if you don't crank the difficulty up. Since every track is made by Sector 3, you can expect the AI to be consistently good on all the track and car combo you can throw at it.\n\n\n\nCons\n\nThe Free2Play System\nThis one is pretty obvious. Yes, you can only choose to buy one pack if you wanted to. But sooner or later, you will want the DTM pack too, which is another $27. And then you find out that Laguna Seca isn't included in the pack. That's gonna be another $5. And then you feel like you want to try the old touring cars, which costs about $10 if you want to buy all of them. I forgot Monza. Another $5 for that. You've pretty much spent twice the amount of Assetto Corsa and get half of its content through modding.\n\nNO CUSTOM SKIN SUPPORT\nSeriously? Every sim racing game out there ENCOURAGES you to paint your own skins by giving out templates for the cars. This one only comes with the stock skins each car has.\n\nALWAYS ONLINE\nFor a sim that's best for singleplayer, it's kinda ironic that it has to be always online. Not to mention that multiplayer is pretty much dead.\n\nUNMODDALE\nEver wanted to try an F1 car with the gane's fantastic AI? NOPE! Gotta wait for Sector 3 to do it. That is, if they even consider having F1 in this game.\n\nFlag rules not fully implemented\nThis may be nitpicking a little. You can get black flagged, but yellow flags are nonexistent I believe.\n\n\nDespite the glaring issues of the game, the AI alone makes the game worth getting. If you don't feel like going to iRacing for an online race, you can have R3E for a great single player experience. Doesn't matter if you're driving GT3 or DTM at Sachsenring or Nurburgring. You can expect to have a really good time with the AI.","January 6, 2015","true","83.2"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","1"

Nearly everyone I've talked to who has truely taken the time to learn the physics, you'll need to adjust your wheel to you, which will take time. After which it's very enjoyable. I've had so much run racing the 1992 DTM cars, and the 2014 DTM Experience is a great singleplayer experience. the full length championships are my personal favorite.\n\nHowever you cannot properly handle the cars on a Keyboard. A gamepad is an improvement, the Microsoft Speed Wheel is probably the best you can do without getting a proper wheel and pedal setup. I have tired all of these avanues prior to getting a Fanatec GT3RS wheel and CSR pedals.\n\nIf you want to get into it, look into getting either Logitech G25 or G27, Fanatac Wheel (Porsche, CSR or clubsport), or a Thrustmaster T500RS, or T300RS.  IT may seem like a big jump, but if you want to really apprechiate Sim Racing, it's the only way to go.\n\nThere are only a few drawbacks I've found with R3E. First, the interface takes a bit to get use to, it's not as intuitive as it could be. Second, The time investment to dial in your controller settings, Lastly the online hoppers are pretty dead overall (although it's still in Alpha, so here's hoping it'll get better in time).","January 31, 2015","true","85.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

This sim just keeps getting better. The latest release with the fantastic nordschleife really puts this at the top of the racing hill. They also worked out a few bugs that were sometimes interrupting the fun - no more. What was previosuly a great game with issues is now starting to really get polished. There is no better sim racing experience that getting into a good online race with this game. Shell out the $20 for some paid content, join some bigboy races with respecful racers, and never look back. The pricing model works well for me because i can buy once (still cheaper than the other sim) and not worry about a subscription. Again, no other racing sim gets my adrenalin flowing like this one - it really conveys the feel of speed and competition. Single player is quite good as well especially for european racing fans, but i'm more of a multiplayer user. Again if you are a sim racer and have not tried this in the last year, do yourself a favor and try it again - then judge for yourself. Even using the free content to get a taste should convince most.\n\nOriginal Review: Great racing sim. There are sims that do certain things better (AC graphics for instance) but as a whole package, this is the sim that makes me feel the most like i'm in a car driving and gets my heart pounding.

Seen a car you like, give it spin for free.  Same track each time, so you can get a really good feel for the car.\n\n* Race Room Competitions.   These are free and you don't need to have purchased the tracks and cars. You compete time trails against other players and your ghost car and you are ranked in a league.\n\nCONS:\n\n* Mainly a single player experience at the moment . Muliplayer is good but still in alpha.\n\n* DO NOT BUY ANY DLC FROM STEAM.\nInstead buy content from the game portal, which is connected to your steam account.\nThey have sales and at the moment you can get DTM 13 for £6.20.  It will also give you a small volume discount and if you buy a pack which has tracks and cars that you already own, then you get a futher discount.  For example I have DTM 13, so DTM 14 is £9.20.\n\nI'm making the jump from from arcade to sim racing and this is much more user friendly and cheper than iracing and even Assetto Corsa.\n\nPlay it yourself and see what you are missing.","February 1, 2015","true","4.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

On a whim, I decided to fire it up again last week, and I've been blown away by just how much it's changed for the better. If you are a fan of motorsport or racing games, I highly recommend this game. The pricing model is a little cumbersome at first, but if you buy a pack such as DTM 2015, you'll find yourself with a fair amount of content for a reasonable price, and you can add more packs gradually if you feel like something different. The inclusion of licensed motorsport series is a plus, and the track list features some interesting European tracks that I haven't seen in many other racing games. The car handling and sounds are outstanding, and the graphics are quite decent too. The actual racing is some of the best I've personally experienced, depending on the AI settings, races can be quite close and the game does a good job of replicating the aggressive doorhandle to doorhandle nature of touring car racing. Perhaps the neatest thing about the game is that you can try it out before commmiting to buy anything, so don't take my word for it, try it out!\n\nI give RaceRoom Racing Experience a solid 8/10.","May 1","true","21.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Bear in mind though; as I haven't had an adac car doing 120MPH all i can do is say that it "feels" good. They have 3 settings for driving: novice/not so novice/ and what they call "get real" Each one has incrimental setting controls over the previous to the point where you can control the bump and rebound and spring rate of your car. I like this, it's more immersive and should give you better handling characteristics. Which I don't know about yet as I'm still in the novice stage, and you learn real fast not to have a heavy foot. See the warning sign for the corner?...means brake...now! I did try the "get real" setting though, and I found it a lot more "hands on" if you know what i mean.\n\nOne thing about this game is it is a micro-economy game. If you want more tracks you need to purchase them along with cars. You can purchase them in packs or 1 at a time, The packs are cheaper to buy cars and tracks "enmasse" but more than individual purchases (I bought a daytona car for $3 USD and a track for $2USD), whereas if I purchased a pack it may run me $50 with 5 cars and several tracks.\n\nThere is a definate learning curve, and if you don't like actual racing simulations then you should move on to a more "friendly" arcade racing game. As the AI in this will definately give you a run for your money. Although I found it a tad too pushy sometimes, they have no qualms about hitting you, and that sucks when you 2nd 3 laps in and then your last and 15 seconds back of the pack!!\n\nI haven"t gotten into any online races yet (kinda wanna get to the point where I'm not hitting every wall first) But There is a lot of online servers, however for where I am, there seems to be less closer ones with a lower ping. hopefully thats just a time differential.\n\nall in all I like this game. I find the graphics nice (but I'm not sight-seeing at 120MPH approaching a chicane lol), and there is a lot of variety. The sounds are nice (deep throaty engines and squealing of tires.), and the user interface is also nice. If your stuck on something and want to immerse yourself into racing, then this is a good purchase, just be patient. there is a definate learning curve.

The 980's are coping nicely.\nSounds are very realistic and clear, surround is good.\nThe AI are the best in any racing sim right now.\nThe cars feel good, the feedback to the Fanatec Clubsport is excellent, FWD WTCC cars are spot on, that said the BMW is awesome, driven correctly it will stay with and often beat the FWD cars which can be tough on certain circuits.\nHad a lot of online races and thoroughly enjoyed every one of them, just need to be able to host servers ourselves but the multiplayer clearly states alpha so i'm happy to be able to even race online right now.\nThere are a nice selection of tracks, would like to see some more from the UK but that's my preference.\nI purchased the majority of my content while on sale, not sure i could justify the full price to be honest as it seems too expensive as it marketed as a "FTP" game, which kind of leaves you feeling mislead and maybe a little cheated.\nMy suggestion, try it, get some content on next sale, you will be pleasantly surprised. The free stuff didn't appeal to me at all, the paid content obviously is a lot better (for me).\nNever know the dev's may realise all they need to do is sell it as a normal game none of this "FTP" marketing, then people should buy it.

Controlling any of the cars with the keyboard is hard. A game controller might make things a bit easier, and the game does support mouse steering, but neither of these is ideal. The free to play content has some very high powered cars which make keyboard control even more difficult, which is one reason that a lot of players give up after a short time.\n\nIf you've got a wheel and pedals it's a different matter. I love it. The cars feel 'alive' - challenging and fun to drive. The AI is really solid, the sound is awesome and the graphics are nice too. A real gem - the ADAC GT Masters 2014 and DTM 2014 packs are simply brilliant and make for some seriously exciting racing against the AI.\n\nIt's good online too\n\nUpdated stuff....\n\nSome folk are complaining about the "free 2 play" description for RaceRoom. I agree, it's a bit odd, maybe the label's a hangover to the old SimBin days. The free content isn't a particularly good example of what the game's actually like. There's a (non-Steam) demo of the ADAC GT Masters 2014 pack available here: http://adac-gtm-experience.com/demo/\n\nthere's also a DTM 2014 demo here:\n\nhttp://www.dtm-experience.com/en/demo/\n\nmight better show the game off.\n\n\nThe price of the content varies a lot depending on how and when you buy it. If you take a little time figuring out what's included in each pack, it's possible to get a pile of good tracks and a car set for £12 - £15 - the DTM 2013 experience is particularly good value at the moment, even thought there's no sale on (sales come round every month or two). Once you have plenty of tracks, you can buy a single car from a car set (they're free to test) and can then use that car to race against all the other cars in that set (on or off line).\n\nIf you assume that you'll spend as much as a normal full price game (say £30) then you can get a substantial slice of the content.\n\n\nThe pace of development is impressive - lots of good stuff has been added recently like the WTCC 2014 car pack. And there's a big physics model overhaul in the works, along with a new ADAC GTM pack for 2015.\n\n\nOne final thing, if you like the game there are some cool 3rd party addons like telemetry widgets and my own Crew Chief app here:\nhttps://forum.sector3studios.com/index.php?threads/offical-release-of-crew-chief-version-2-now-with-volume-controls-and-even-launches-r3e-for-you.2516/","May 16, 2015","true","371.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is a very good simulation but there are some that would say otherwise due to not taking the time to get to know the physics model and the fact that the gas pedal has more positions than just nothing to floored.\n\nNow thats not to say that this game doesn't have flaws. After all what games these days don't have a flaw here and there? The only big flaw for me is that the AI has vastly superiour grip to the player but you can get close with the right amount of tuning and the Devs are working on fixing that issue right now. Online races in this game are a real blast in Get Real mode but first I beg you to log practice time in this mode. Based on the multiplayer races I have seen lately people think that get real mode is going to be like driving a normal car in real life.\n\nNow the problem with that kind of thinking is that the engines on these cars are made to go much faster than a normal car that you would drive daily so Get Real mode takes some practice but after you master it it is definately the best mode. Another thing the devs might add soon is an offline mode which will be great for unexpected times of internet outage since you would still be able to log some track time if you want.\n\nIn short yes this game has some flaws but so does every other game ever developed so if you really like racing give this a try. I mean its free so you've got nothing to lose except a little bit of time if you don't like the game but wouldn't you have burned that time gaming anyway?","July 29, 2015","true","56.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

So my first impressions of the game are good, in terms of gameplay the sounds are immaculate and very realistic. The force feedback you recieve through the wheel are really good and racing is challenging especially in multiplayer.\n\nPros:\n\n-Great Sounds\n-Great Force Feedback\n-Car models look good\n-Racing is a challenge and you feel like you are in a real car\n-Has support for all controllers (wheels and joysticks and controllers)\n-You can make your own overlay for a race and broadcast it live\n-If you drive the wrong way you ghost meaning that trolls cannot crash you out using a head on collision\n-Physics and handling are very realistic\n-Different modes: Novice, Amateur and Realistic\n-Decent Graphics and fps with support for high end and low end spec computers\n-Good default overlay\n-So many things that can be changed in settings\n\nCons:\n\n-The free mode only comes with 3 (I think) car series and 2 (I think) tracks\n-No pit crew/garage interior\n-No Career mode where you can make your own racer and have any sort of car improvement\n-Mirror visibility is not great and hard to depict cars until they are too close to try and defend\n\nI realise this game is still in development and i am looking forward to more content but I think sector3 studios have done a fantastic job on this game so its a thumbs up from me.\n\nTherefore I would rate it 9/10 as there could be a few things that could be improved (like adding some more free dlc etc.) but it surprised me with how good the gameplay was.","February 8","true","30.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Most of the racing right now is in the DTM series, but the challenges are fun and allow you to try several cars and tracks without paying a dime.\n\nVisually, it's a bit bright and bold, but the environments look good and clear. Visibility and details are high, and the shadows passing on the dashboard look really nice. The performance on High settings with 8x AA with a 750ti is 60 fps when there's only one car, so I think the optimization is pretty good as well.\n\nThe sounds are probably the best you'll hear in a racing game, whether it's the samples themselves or just the richness of the chassis squeaking, the transmission, the tires, etc. Everything is there and sounds great. No other game comes close.\n\nThe interface is still complex and confusing, and some options are only available from the main menu. The FFB is very adjustable, but the settings are not explained much, so it takes a lot of fiddling to get everything right. For me, that means G25 and TH8RS. The modern cars don't default to auto-clutch, which is lame.\n\nBecause the game looks and sound so good, and now that the FFB is finally letting the new and tighter physics shine through,  Raceroom is becoming a killer racing game. I never thought it could be possible, but out of this could arise a GTR3 people have hoped for. In the meantime, doing time trials, challenges and racing in DTM is a lot of fun.\n\nTo newcomers: skip the free content and go straight for the competitions, this is where the higher quality content is. It cycles through cars and tracks regularly, so you can sample stuff until you find what you like. The freebies are still the old wobbly garbage from 2012, it seems. I think everything will be updated over time.","July 3, 2014","true","30.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Nevertheless, the reviews were so bad about a year ago that I didn't touch it.  So I did wait until Dec 2015 to try it out after all the patches and changes that seemed to make it worth buying.  I race in iRacing, PCars, Assetto Corsa, FM, FH, and now RaceRoom.  The graphics inside the cockpit and looking out to the opponents is probably the best among these sims providing you have a decent PC and can max out the graphics.  I give it a 9.5/10 for graphics.  The physics are also very good since you can adjust many settings in the FFB.  So if you make a few adjustments, then I would easily say 9/10 on phyiscs.  And with all the adjustments you get for the feel, then nearly a perfect.    The gameplay is focused on DTM and GT3 in my opinion and that is pretty much why I bought it.  No other sims have anything really in the DTM class although I am hoping PCars gets into DTM more.  So if you like DTM, I can tell you this is the best sim for DTM.  I haven't had any issues at all and have to say the negative onslaught this game gets is just not accurate.  But there seems to be a few issues.  Like with the fuel and tire wear set to real, they don't seem to ever go down.  It's 100% all the time so I think that is a bug.  And the AI is annoying until you learn how to avoid them.  But this is one of the best sims out there in my opinion, especially DTM and GT3.  I just don't understand how people can spend 15 min on a game and slam the heck out of it.  Their connectivity issues and setup is more than likely their own setup problem.  Yes, it needs a little help with car setups too like adding tire pressure...lol  But the game feels and looks excellent,  It's worth the money for DTM for sure.\n\nUpdate: 4/30/2016 - RaceRoom is Awesome!  I've waited a month after the 3/31/2016 update that massively improved the GT3 and Prototype physics.  The new physics and new FFB settings, new car setup, especially for GT3, ADAC GT Masters, DTM, and the new Audi P1 along with Nordschleife puts this sim to the stellar level in my opinion.  In addition, the fuel and tire wear now works finally.  Neverthelesss, the new FFB meter to check for clipping is very nice.  I am very critical of physics and so you know where I am coming from, Assetto Corsa and iRacing have the top slot with PCars a close second.  Race Room was just behind PCars.  Unfortunately, Forza just doesn't have the physics at these levels, e.g. you cannot feel the rubber on the road and utilze braking to control the cornering accurately in Forza Motorsport at least yet.  So Forza is last in the physics ranking among all these.  But I am now putting RaceRoom up there at the Assetto Corsa and iRacing level.  I am at the point of saying the physics in Race Room, at least for the DTM, ADAC, GT3 and Prototype classes, is possibly even better than Assetto Corsa and iRacing.  The sound in Race Room is also stellar if not the best among the aformentioned sims and I am not even using 7.1 yet just stereo.  Race Room does not get the recognition it deserves....another point is I am astonished it's onlyh using DX9c where all the others I've mentioned are on DX11 or even DX12.  So it blows me away they are getting this level of crisp graphics viewing the opponents cars and interior that they do....congrats Race Room for pulling that off.","February 7","true","57.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

First let me say that I raced real cars for 9 years on both ovals and road courses. I've also sim raced on and off since about 1992.  I'm not an expert on sim racing, but I've tried most of the major players and R3E is among the very best -- I find the physics to be superb, at least when used with a good wheel and pedals.  I can't comment on how it plays on kb, controller or anything else and frankly I don't care.\n\nOne of the problems with sim racing is how to represent the loss of traction that one *feels* in the real world through balance, touch and seat of the pants. A common perception in the sim world is that a game is realistic when it is very difficult, but the real world isn't like that -- vehicles only get very difficult close to the limit.  I think R3E does an admirable job of balancing difficulty without crossing the line into "arcade".  Is it better than iRacing or Assetto Corsa? I don't know....that's really on a car-by-car basis for me, but some of them are better and none that I've driven are really bad (and even iRacing has had some stinkers).\n\nI also don't think the "free to play" system is that bad.  You can have some great fun without ever buying anything!  Certain track and car combinations are always available (for free!) in the "competitions".  These are really just hot-lap contests, but they are fun and you get to try out the content.....and it is still free.  Raceroom is expensive if you buy all the DLC, but I just don't see a need for that -- just buy whatever series you want to race in, and if you are really cheap just by one car in each class.  Either way it is still a lot cheaper than iRacing.\n\nThe downsides of Raceroom:\n\n-the severs are usually empty, but then I don't use this for online racing.\n- the AI can be a bit aggressive, but are otherwise pretty good.\n-can't save setups (really????).

Fortunately, not a requirement in this one. I also beat GT3 and most of GT4. So I'm familiar with the overall brutality of these simulators.). Then again, it's been ages since I last played a simulation racing game (At least 5 years worth of rust on me); and now with more accurate simulation settings as such, ugh. Made a decent personal time on Get Real (without shattering my car or breaking the engine), but I needed Novice to get a better handle of when to brake overall for next time (I can survive, at least, but I'm nowhere near leaderboard-ready yet at time of post). You botch the braking anywhere (especially blind corners and chicanes), and you can mess up your entire lap, or go off course, or 180-1080 your car, and invalidate your lap (no shortcutting like I used to in GT and NFS; also no more using other cars as guardrails on certain turns either :( ).\n\nNot stopping me from playing this more, and maybe getting an expansion pack or two to have more cars to drive with and more tracks to drive on. However, as precise I can get with a keyboard, I lack pressure sensitivity in order to draw a bead more precisely; so my skills are a tad biased (better with a gamepad for these kinds of games). +20.5 seconds (1:43.334 on a track) from 1st place (Leaderboards, that is) is not good enough for me. I gotta shave off more time... If I can clear +10 seconds from 1st, then I'll be a happier driver. +5, and I'll be impressed with myself. This game is not easy, because it's less game, and more simulator. The physics are quite familiar and rather unforgiving (like reality would be), especially in Get Real (and that mode also permits fine-tuning your car's aerodynamics, gear-shift ratios, and just about everything else under the hood; and tire wear is also quite unforgiving too, so keep those in check along with your fuel). If you seek a casual racing experience, I suggest a different game, lest you want to lose some keyboards or controllers in frustration. It can become casual, however, if you're a pro at this kind of stuff.\n\nBeen awhile since I've had such a detailed racing experience, so thumbs up on bringing back my memories of Gran Turismo (In due time, I'll see you guys on the Nürburgring Course (up to 10 minutes per-lap, and that's with skill and a good car; BIIIG Course (28.265 km long). An ultimate test for drivers, both skill and endurance. Look it up. In GT4, my best time was about 9 minutes, or slightly less than that, and even so, I had difficulties there.)). However, only other (personal) setback is that your real name is visible (security and such, I guess). Just a friendly heads-up for anyone else that feels like crashing into walls and cars non-stop (eg- signing up to play). The heads-up is also for those that would end up broadcasting, and still want to remain anonymous; I suggest going somewhere else for privacy while broadcasting publicly.\n\nI can imagine how this will play with Oculus support. Speaking of which, the graphics are 10/10; runs smoothly with high settings, even for older machines like mine, and the graphics are a beauty overall; the sound is also rather pretty too, for you gearheads. If you want an immersive driving experience, or want to relive an A-Spec GT experience, I recommend this. Plus, it's free to play. Despite the 10GB download (mostly locked content), what's not to love? I suggest building some experience and skill before investing in any new cars/tracks/DLC packs. At least, know you can handle it first, before burning your money on this, and then giving it a negative review from poor judgement user-side.\n\nSee you on the leaderboards, and by chance, on the tracks.","December 14, 2014","true","0.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

So here we go.\n\nPros:\n\n-BEST PRICE EVER\n-pretty graphics that run smooth on my weak pc\n-great physics and AI\n-large selection of cars and tracks to choose from for a fair price\n-supports all of my contollers\n-incredible sound\n-easy to use UI\n-the ability to test drive cars BEFORE you buy them\n-multiplayer (in alpha)\n\nNow the cons:\n\n-after you buy a car, you have to pay MOAR for more skins\n-game isn't fully developed, as there are small bugs here and there. not too bad\n-you have to buy stuff with "VRP", which you pay for with real money. It just confuses me.\n\n\nOverall, this is the most fun you can have for free if you're a gamer, and if you're a simmer, this is a great and upcoming sim with high quality DLC for a fair price. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone. Hey- it's free!","July 1, 2015","true","26.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are around 5 free cars and 2 tracks. This lets you try the game out and see if you like it. You purchase content (cars, tracks, packs, and experiences) based on what you want. You don't have to buy everything and most people don't.\n\nThe packs are always discounted and go on sale frequently. Any content you have also gets discounted from packs and experiences.\n\nExperiences are basically full games that run through the base game of Raceroom. (So the DTM and ADAC GT experiences.)\n\nAll the content I own I got on sale and I got DTM 2014 and WTC 2013 for free! I won these through the free competitions that are held in Raceroom. They cycle through these competitions around each month. Some are just for bragging rights and some have rewards such as the in game currency (VRP), game content, or even real race tickets.\n\nI have all the other big sims and I like raceroom for providing content that the other don't and also providing real race series with the tracks they race on. You can compete on the leaderboards with real race drivers in the DTM and ADAC GT series and they even host races with them from time to time.\n\nI definitely recommend trying it out and seeing if you like it. If you do, I suggest waiting for one of the sales either through raceroom or on steam, like the summer sale :).","June 14, 2015","true","67.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Along with Assetto Corsa, these are the driving sims I have been looking for. I have always played driving games like Forza, Grid, F1, NFS & various Rally games on consoles then recently got Project cars. At first I really liked Project Cars graphics, Car selection and tracks selection but in my opinion the games play ability was my problem. I tried playing it with an Xbox controller which I found very frustrating and no fun at all. I was told to buy a steering wheel for the ultimate experience. So after a couple of months and much frustration, I said what the hell & bought a £270 steering wheel which is compatible with Xbox and PC. Project Cars was actually much better but I just did not like the game play and car feel on track. As my new steering wheel was also PC compatible I started to look for driving sims on Steam. This is where I found Race Rooms. It was a breath of fresh air. At first, I thought it can't be any good if it's free but I wanted to test my steering wheel out so I downloaded it. OMG! Fell in love straight away. This was the game I was looking for. Excellent graphics, great car choice, great tracks, easy to operate and fantastic game play. No more dodgy handling like Project Cars.\n\nTo enjoy this game to the max, you need a good steering wheel with force feedback.\nA couple of months ago I was a bit reluctant to buy a wheel for so much money and was concerned about where to set it up. Anyway I gave in and bought one from Amazon and converted my home office. Best thing I have ever done for gaming. I haven't touched my Xbox One console in months. Recently I have even bought Assetto Corsa too. These are my best racing sims at present which I feel comfortable with and can control on the track.\n\nI have bought all the tracks and several car packs. On occasions there are weekend discount deals which can save you money. Also, buy VRP credit from Race Room website direct because you get more VRP then buying add-ons directly from Steam.\n\nAlso, you MUST have Internet connection to play this game.\n\nAnyway, I would defiantly recommend this game with a good steering wheel with force feed back and a nice sound setup. No sim game is perfect out there right now because we all like and want different experiences.

You do however get a few free cars and tracks to play and this will help you decide if the game is worth investing in long term. I promise you will be happy if you do and over all its still way cheaper then most other racing simulators out there. This game is fully controller, steering wheel or keyboard and mouse compatible.

I find the physics of every car much more alive and engaging than similar vehicles on say, Project Cars or Assetto Corsa, with the force feedback (Using a G27) and the sounds being top notch. Easily the best of any racing sim IMO.\n\nThe mix of content is fantastic and the track list is a brilliant! - A load of tracks you actually want to drive, not a load of soul-less modern build tracks. Not many games can boast the opportunity to jump from a mental super tuned Zakspeed Capri, to a 2014 WTCC Lada, to a BMW Z4 GT3 then in to a 1992 Audi Quattro DTM. And then choose to take each either up a hillclimb, round Bathurst or to Indianapolis!\n\nAnd the graphics, once dialled up are great. I run a GTX970 and that runs everything maxed. Yet while you can see its a game, everything looks very real.\n\nThe whole, 'free to play, but each thing costs extra, so you end up spending a tone if you get in to it', idea sucks.

First night playing, it was ok. The graphics are good. The physics seem good while providing a challenging driving experience. Although it did take me another day to get my FFB sorted. There really is no explanation for what some of the settings do. (or a short rather canned one)\n\nOnce I got my FFB dialed in, the game/sim really started to shine. I use the Logitech G27 with pedals and H-shifter. A wheel really is the preferred way to get the best experience, though I'm sure there are a handful of controller users out there who can rip it up pretty good.\n\nThe sounds really are pretty amazing. Especially when you start to drive different cars. Considering I've got 12 hours and 128 laps under my belt in one weekend, its safe to say I'm hooked.\n\nIf the devs can continue in the right direction with development, R3E has a lot of potential to be great! And don't be turned off by paid content until you at least try the free stuff. Other racing sim organizations (not mentioning any names) do the same thing.\n\n=====Update 02/13/2015======\n\nAfter 1100+ laps and over 2 days of total in game time I can say I'm still hooked. The most recent update Feb 2015 improved the AI and optimized the graphics. Dedicated servers are coming soon. I believe this year which will open up online racing leagues.\n\nI own almost all the cars. All tracks and all packs but the hill climb. Yes a little pricey, but worth it IMO. The devs stay in constant contact with the community which is more than I can say for other games/sims. New tracks and cars are still in the works, the most recent upcoming new track, Sonoma and the Cadillac CTS VR coupe to be released soon as paid content. R3E has only gotten better since I've been playing it and it was pretty good when I started with it anyway.\n\nR3E is definitely to be taken seriously among other race sims currently on the market.","January 7, 2015","true","96.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I was like a drunk driver, all over the track. Frame drops and other issus on start of race didn't help.\n\nForce Feedback: TOO MANY CONTROLLS on wheel settings plus these settings get changed for every car, So you have to go through the process all over again (most likely) if you change cars. The default steering was WAY to sensitive so I decreased and then the car felt sluggish and it felt like controller lag.\n\nI never felt like I was racing :-(  I also found it impossible to drift due to the problems described with the wheel response and force feedback settings. Maye it's the wheel as I see other people mention the Logitech setups are an issue. I just don't want to spend hrs setting up a wheel for each car I want to use.\n\nThe grass / track edges seem suck you in. Is that considered realism? I know many games will punish for cutting corners and it should be slippy on the throttle, but should you get sucked into the barrier?","February 19, 2015","true","4.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

When I finally played it, my overall verdict was that there needs to be some game optimization. I can run GRID Autosport on Max but with this game my PC was struggling even at the low end. This is a very graphics heavy game and you need to know your PC can handle it before you start investing. Other than that I love this series for it's car models and the accuracy. Not many other games include disciplines such as DTM and WTCC and as my favorites I couldn't be more pleased.

First off let me say I've been with this game from the start. From closed beta till now. I've seen it go from meh.. to a very decent game. Probably one of the best racing titles I've ever played. I always knew that if anybody could get a racing title right it would be these guys. It has the possibilites of blowing GTR 2 out of the water. Yes it could be that good!\nHowever there are some very serious issues here. One is the pitstops. Flat after the Oct. 20 patch they don't work. I understand that pitsops in custom championships are coming and that's okay. They weren't originally advertsied to begin with after all. I can live with that. Impatiently but I'll live till then. However it's the broken pitsops in ADAC 2014 experience and DTM 2014 experience that upset me. Can't say about DTM 2015 as I don't own it and from the looks of it I may never. Working pitstops were advertised for the DTM and ADAC 2014 cars. Heck I owned the DTM 2013. It was the only reason to buy the newer set.\n\nIn ADAC 2014 the player's car drives straight through the pits without stopping. Resulting in disqualification for not stopping. In DTM 2014 your car stops but the pit doesn't seem to count. You guessed it resulting in your disqualification. These were advertised features. We have to assume they had this worked out before the advertised it , right? Guess not!\n\nThere are many other issues and to their credit they working on them. As the recent hotfix suggests but it's not enough. One main quirk if you decide to step into this game, is BEWARE THE PATCHES! They generally break twice as much as they fix. One over the summer brought the whole fool game down. In it's current state I couldn't recommend this game unless you are very patient. And it will be tested, trust me! It is a near brilliant racing title with lot's of racing fun though and if and only if you're willing to hang with it you will love it and hate it and love it and hate it.... You get the picture. I gave this title a thumbs up because it doesn't totally deserve a thumbs down! However you have been warned!\n\nAs for the 503 errors that everyone is experiencing. I can't say as mine thankfully have been limited. I must be living right or lucky. Also I need to add that I play only single player not multiplayer. So my review can't address any issues there as I haven't seen them. I really would like to give this game a thumbs sideways but can't. Hence the thumbs up.","November 12, 2015","true","174.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I find the physics of every car much more alive and engaging than similar vehicles on say, Project Cars or Assetto Corsa, with the force feedback (Using a G27) and the sounds being top notch. Easily the best of any racing sim IMO.\n\nThe mix of content is fantastic and the track list is a brilliant! - A load of tracks you actually want to drive, not a load of soul-less modern build tracks. Not many games can boast the opportunity to jump from a mental super tuned Zakspeed Capri, to a 2014 WTCC Lada, to a BMW Z4 GT3 then in to a 1992 Audi Quattro DTM. And then choose to take each either up a hillclimb, round Bathurst or to Indianapolis!\n\nAnd the graphics, once dialled up are great. I run a GTX970 and that runs everything maxed. Yet while you can see its a game, everything looks very real.\n\nThe whole, 'free to play, but each thing costs extra, so you end up spending a tone if you get in to it', idea sucks. But with the prices being no so bad, it could be worst. I could be in to iRacing.\n\nGive it a try.

I promise you will be happy if you do and over all its still way cheaper then most other racing simulators out there. This game is fully controller, steering wheel or keyboard and mouse compatible.

I think the likes of Assetto Corsa and Project Cars can only be substantially better by having a better selection of road-going cars and the Nordschleife, available as standard.","December 24, 2014","true","229.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Considering it's (apparently) not the final product, it's a beautiful game with some incredibly well-modelled cars with fun handling and great sound. The price of the addons is more than reasonable, in my opinion. My favourite pack so far has been the DTM 1992 car pack; the cars are just ludicrous fun.\n\nBear in mind that online multiplayer is fairly sparse. Sometimes you won't find any games for any of the car packs you own (aside from the free content), which is a shame. However - and this is a rarity in sim racing games - the AI provide a serious challenge and can often be more fun than racing online.\n\nDownload this game, buy the DTM 1992 pack and race on!","March 24, 2015","true","25.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Not me.\n\nThis game has the best sounding cars I have ever heard in a video game. Period. Nothing else even comes close.\nIt also has outstanding forcefeedback, a big community, and accurate simulation. The AI is pretty good, it's very agressive though. It seems to be a bit dynamic.\n\nI can't get enough of it. There's also a lot of real racing drivers that play this game which is pretty cool. It was, and wasn't, surprising to see Mike Rockenfeller at the top of the leaderboards for a few tracks.\n\nIf you like motorsport and have a racing wheel this is a must play. It's FREE, there's a few tracks you can try and you can test drive every car in the game for free, along with a handful you get for free.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SonicTWDKenny/recommended/211500/","SonicTWDKenny","TWD Kenny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SonicTWDKenny/","205 products in account","Overall, I like this game. I, to be honest, expected something along the lines of Forza or Grand Torismo standards, but in my eyes, it met a fraction of those standards. I have to admit though, this is a very nice and sharp looking game when it's on it's highest settings (it set mine to the highest setting because my computer is very powerful). I am very fond of how many cars there are in the game and I love how each and every one of them has their own different sound. Although i'm not a car expert, if fact I don't really know much about cars in the first place....but I still wanted to try this game as I have heard it looked amazing and was a very good free to play game. They were right. Although this game has a lot of good stuff about it, I feel it has quite a lot of negative stuff about it. To start off, I noticed how there was a MAJOR lack of music unlike Forza or Grand Torismo or most racing games combined. This really annoys me because I feel that the music can bring a certain video game to life (ex: Saints Row 3, I actually got hooked on it because I started listening to it's soundtrack and just fell in love). I also didn't like how a good 75% of controls are unbinded at default, which I don't know if that's because the developers just wanted to let the player bind them his/herself or because they were just too lazy. Another problem is with every single car. What I noticed is how they all fail to break especially on very hard turns. I always find myself in 5-6th gear and then a very hard turn comes and I slow down, but I slow down enough that i'm still in 3rd-4th gear which doesn't help with the turn (I stop nearly 2 seconds before the actual turn). This is also a problem because I don't know if I properly binded a key; handbrake. I binded it to space (it shows I binded it correctly in the settings, but i'm just not sure) and when I press space while the car is just rolling, nothing happens. If I use it when i'm turning, slight to nothing really happens. In most case senarios I feel it does virtually nothing, when compared to other racing games where the handbrake is vital to the game. Handbrake wasn't even pre-binded when I started the game. Set aside all the negative stuff about the game, I would like to focus on the positive stuff in the game. What I think I enjoy the most about this is how it's actually more of a formula one racing game as you don't see day-to-day cars in the game like Forza. I personally love the formula one cars because they always give me a sence of how it would really feel if I was in one. With a computer so heavily powered and with a game that looks so amazing as this one does, they make up well to fulfill what I like most about formula one cars. I also like how there are LOTS of cars and tracks to choose from (there aren't many default and free tracks and cars, but there are a TON of paid tracks and cars). Although I don't have a lot of time under my belt playing the game, I can see it will turn out to be a very well made game. 7.9/10","May 29, 2014","true","0.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

SimBin/Sector3 has always been a leader in bringing the driver the most realistic sound experience in all their titles, and this continues with R3E.\n\nWith the last major update, Sector3 have done a major overhaul of the force feedback system. Their track developers have developed a new technology to improve the presentation and feedback of their track’s road surface utilising data from telemetry to create a highly dense road surface that features small bumps and imperfections in the surface the increases the quality of the force feedback immensely.\n\nAI does leave plenty of room for improvement, while R3E supposably utilises an “Adaptive AI”, I find many times, AI will run up the back of you like a solid lead block, causing a frustrating racing experience at the best of times with little to no effect on themselves.\n\nContent is plentiful, with a range of cars and tracks with new content currently added recently including the ADAC 2013 GT Masters Pack and the WTCC 2013 Pack including tracks as part of each package. Still, the biggest question mark is the pricing system, while I have noticed and taken advantage of the pack discounts, standard pricing is on the expensive side. I personally would advise to hold off for specials or car packs prior to purchasing content if you consider yourself the collector, or buy one car in each class as needed. With the new inclusion of the new “Test Drive” feature, you will be able to make a sound decision prior to purchase regardless of the price.\n\nAs a free to play game, this title is worth the time to experience the improvements that Sector3 have made to bring this sim up to the standard that many sim racers will look for. If you're willing to part with your cash to race new cars on new tracks, then you will enjoy a race or two, whether its a against the AI, online multiplayer with friends, or a quick hotlapping session.\n","November 24, 2014","true","125.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I couldnt care less what tracks name is , or what car am i driving , as long as its a nice track and a good car phisics ,so i play would play rFactor with unlicensed cars and track that work good rather then pay 200e for RaceRoom that has all licensed cars that u can not feal and have to pay for a door panel and tyers .. thats what it boilds down too, they would sell i virtual wheels and windshields if they could but they cant so they sell cars and tracks, im not in too that, so what are the alternatives\n\nAlternatives\nGSC as Game stock car 2013 is a better sim on every level, exept multipayer but that will improove when ppl realise that its the best sim on the market , apart from iRacing that so expensive u cant even consider it in a category of 20-30e and doesnt feel as good as GSC\nAlso Aseto corsa is better then Race room, and its cheeper , but its not finished\nSo thats my review , boils down too if u have money there is no reason not to try to buy content, but if u suport financial models like that u will end up paying for wind shields ,rims and car skins, maybe even P2W like high octane fuel.\nIf u are smart, u will suport games that dont try to get as much money from u but insted focuse on giving u a pleasure of racing against AI and ppl with as much content as u like , with mods, oficial content etc....so for me there is just GSC 2013 and Aseto Corsa that are on that level of racing, i Racing too but thats for profesional drivers not for a casual gamer..Race room expirience is a money generating machine not a racing simuator , just like World of Tanks is, Star Citisen and all other so called free games . Thank u simbin for not existing any more and making room for real racing gamers over at Asetto corsa and GSC. over and out","October 28, 2014","false","45.2"," 46 of 88 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","46","88","3","3"

Sure it has it's foibles, but it is a game still in development and the pros far outweigh the cons.\n\n+ Stunning sounds, everything from backfires to suspension tweaks, from transmission flex to wind buffeting.\n+ Great graphics. Only DX9 sure, but wonderful lighting and colour.\n+ Good physics. A little more forgiving than perhaps it should be, but they do use race driver feedback, and it makes it more accessible.\n+ Awesome content. Unless you like open-wheelers, then the content is stunning, from DTM to Group 5, from WTCC to GT Masters.\n+ You can try out any car before buying it, which is an awesome feature.\n\n- The pay model has its benefits and it's disadvantages. Firstly, you only have to buy what you want, which means you can in theory pay less than a normal 'all-up front' game, in which I often find I don't use all the content anyway. The disadvantage is that it is on the expensive side for sure, though much cheaper than iRacing and there is no monthly subscription. You also only need one car from any group of cars to be able to compete with the others, like iRacing.\n- The servers are still not stable, but is something they are working on, and is improving at a decent rate.\n- Would be better if the circuits were laser-scanned, though the upcoming Nordschleife will be.","June 27, 2015","true","124.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Although it's classed as a free to play game it really isn't.  You get a couple of cars and the odd track for free but for anything else you're going to have to dig deep.  You are expected to purchase VP points for real cash and then exchange your VP points to purchase cars and tracks.  This can empty your pockets to the tune of hundreds of £.\n\nOn top of this they have other 'purchase to play' addons called 'Experiences'.  At present there is the 'DTM Experience' which bolts on to the RRE  menus but runs a full DTM 2013 season against AI.....again, with no Multiplayer.  This comes at the cost of a full game and is basically what seasoned sim racer would call a mod of RRE.  The next "Experience" to come along will be the British or World Touring Car Championship in which you will be expected to shell out another 20-30 £ or Euros for.\n\nWhile this is all going on you cannot use the tracks from DTM experience is the standard game of RRE.  No no no, you have to buy the tracks again even though they already exist in the DTM Experience.\n\nEven though this is a fairly decent sim it looks like Simbin will contnue to milk you for every penny they can and I for one will turn to better (And much cheaper) simulators like Assetto Corsa and rFactor 2 as they have an active modding community which provide free content as well as being able to share tracks can be between mods etc.\n\nA great game spoilt by a rabid thirst for your money.","March 12, 2014","true","204.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, be warned that with a high level of realism in the physics and handling comes a higher difficulty, or at least a much steeper learning curve. The game is probably much better when played on a wheel, but with a standard controller you're probably gonna have a frustrating time. I know I did.\n\nIf you live and breathe racing sims and don't mind taking the time to learn how to control the monstrously powerful cars in this game, go for it. If you're looking for a relaxing blast through the tracks with a more arcade-y feel, this definitely isn't the game for you.\n\nTrack and car selection is limited without paying, and it would be nice if all of the free cars were grouped in one list so you didn't have to search around, but pay-to-play stuff like this comes with the territory with free games.\n\ntl;dr: This game treats racing as SRS BUSINESS, be prepared.","August 15, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What the negative feedback fails to mention is this, YOU CAN TEST DRIVE ANY CAR FOR FREE!!!\nYou do only get a few tracks to start with, but now you seem to get a whole load more cars for free, trust me its worth spending some time with this sim just for the sound and the free test driving..... hop in the Ford Capri Race Car, I spent and hour test driving it simply for the insane noise it makes, id short shift most of the time and then treat myself to the odd high rev just to hear the engine, it actually gave me goose bumps!\n\nSo then the physics.......... all I need to say here is that actual real racing drivers use this as training, TIMO GLOCK is one name that springs to mind, his profile in game reveals over 4 days of gameplay haha. Yes its a hard game to master and I'm a long way off, if I'm lucky I can get in the top 30% on a leaderboard and ive been playing these games/sims for over 15 years.\n\nGraphics are not the greatest but you get the feeling more of the processing power is being used on the physics engine than on processing eye candy. Real sense of rubber and tarmac like you used to get with RACE07.\n\nAnd the sound..... once again its worth throwing a few quid at this title just for the sound.

Not liking the game because you have to buy content is not a legitimate reason to leave a negative review.    You have to buy everything these days and why is that different here?   It's cost is comparative to any other title  when yuo add a few content packs into play.  Yes if you add them all you will spend more money then an entire game, you also end up with Laser Scanned tracks, some of the best driving physics a simulation has\n\nGraphically the game is a little behind but it IMO actually does a great job at looking the most realistic and providing most realistic feel when racing.    RF2 does an ok job here but being DX9 only is a hold back.  AC is gorgeous but not real,  Project Cars looks like a video game.  PC looks the best, but also has the worst driving model and is not realistic in look at all.\n\nIf you enjoyed Race 07, GTR2, and GTR Evolution you will like RRE.  To me this is the spiritual success of these  titles and I will continue to support both Simbing/Sector3 and ISI and their Gmotor efforts.

Although it's classed as a free to play game it really isn't.  You get a couple of cars and the odd track for free but for anything else you're going to have to dig deep.  You are expected to purchase VP points for real cash and then exchange your VP points to purchase cars and tracks.  This can empty your pockets to the tune of hundreds of £.\n\nOn top of this they have other 'purchase to play' addons called 'Experiences'.  At present there is the 'DTM Experience' which bolts on to the RRE  menus but runs a full DTM 2013 season against AI.....again, with no Multiplayer.  This comes at the cost of a full game and is basically what seasoned sim racer would call a mod of RRE.  The next "Experience" to come along will be the British or World Touring Car Championship in which you will be expected to shell out another 20-30 £ or Euros for.\n\nWhile this is all going on you cannot use the tracks from DTM experience is the standard game of RRE.  No no no, you have to buy the tracks again even though they already exist in the DTM Experience.\n\nEven though this is a fairly decent sim it looks like Simbin will contnue to milk you for every penny they can and I for one will turn to better (And much cheaper) simulators like Assetto Corsa and rFactor 2 as they have an active modding community which provide free content as well as being able to share tracks can be between mods etc.\n\nA great game spoilt by a rabid thirst for your money.","March 12, 2014","true","204.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With $65 you can get 10000 vRP which is *much* cheaper than buying it in-game or using Steam Wallet and you'll be able to buy pretty much all the content in the DLC store. Next, wait for things that you want to go on sale. Test drive the cars that you want to buy in-game first to make sure you like them. Please note: you *do not* have to own all cars in a class to race against a full field. If you only like the Corvette Z06, then just buy the one or two liveries that you like and when you race against AI, you'll still see McLarens and Mercedes-Benzs out on track. I picked up the ADAC GT 2014, WTCC 2015, American Track Pack, and Audi Sport TT Cup 2015 (one livery) for $27. That's *very* reasonable for a dozen tracks and a dozen cars and a few dozen liveries.\n\nLast note on the DLC: *do not* purchase the DLC through Steam as the discounts don't apply there.\n\nNow, as far as the driving, the FFB is detailed and informative with many settings to adjust how much each effect is weighted in the steering. You can also define clutch bite point, clutch and brake sensitivity, dead zone, upper and lower limits, as well as tune the shifter debounce timeout - and many more options. The graphics are good and the sounds are great - you can tune how much suspension squeak, tire scrub, transmission whine, etc. The AI are generally pretty good and make for a lot of fun in tighter races. I haven't tried out the online functionality.\n\nAside from the Portimao circuit and Lakeview Hill Climb stage, all of the free content is pretty boring and doesn't do a great job of selling the sim's potential. The Audi Sport TT Cup 2015 car is what really sold me on the sim and with its push-to-pass 10-second boost system it makes for awesome racing.\n\nThe main downside to this sim is that it *requires* a 100% always-on internet connection to the Sector 3 servers, even for single player practice. If your internet goes down for a moment or you lose connection for an instant, you're immediately booted out of the game until your connection is satisfactory again. As of this time, there is no offline mode and even slight flutters in internet connection will cause issues. It appears to have something to do with the anti-cheat mechanism they use (there are regular tournaments with leaderboards and prizes, etc) as well as the content management system to make sure you're only using DLC that you own, coupled with the online stats profiling (it logs how many laps you've done in each car at each track, how long you've spent off-track, etc) and the online telemetry upload for replays and such. It's annoying if you don't have a stable internet connection, so keep that in mind.\n\nThe sim is quite good with lots of good quality content and highly polished FFB and sound effects. I'm playing with a TrackIR 5, Logitech G25, Renovatio SRD-9c dash, on Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (Core i7-6700, 16 GB DDR4, 512 GB M.2 SSD, GTX 970) on a 34" ultrawide (21:9) display at 3440x1440.","April 13","true","72.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The sound effects are first class as mentioned in many reviews. Definitely music to the ears and makes the adrenaline pump, simply outstanding. Having completed my racing license and tracking several sports/race cars over the years, I find the physics very good. Professional high calibre racers would be better suited to comment on the precision of the various cars.\n\nIt would be great to have a career mode introduced to add to the immersion, this would bring me back to the track more often.\n\nThe negative reviews with thumbs down due to pay to play model are both unfair and unrealistic. RacRroom make it possible to drive a couple cars and tracks free to sample the game, same as a demo of many other games/sims. Then if you like it, help keep the franchise going by purchasing some cars, tracks or both. If you don't enjoy it, nothing invested. For five or six bucks you can have a couple cars and learn to drive them properly. To truly learn a car and track takes a fair amout of seat time, so there is no need to drop a whole bunch of money right off the bat anyway, then, add as you go.\n\nHaving only sampled the online competions they seemed ok. This is not what I'm after personally so really have no valid input regarding online human v human competition.\n\nIn summary, this an excellent and fun sim; for a performance car or racing enthusiast you can't go wrong with RaceRoom.\n","June 1","true","27.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you want an easy arcade style game, as a lot of the other reviews suggest to me, then move on, this isn't a game, it's a serious simulation.  Like most serious simulations, you can't expect to get everything in one download.  You buy the base and then you add the elements that interest you, just like people did with scalextric or electric train sets back in the good old days :)  The advantage of this offering is that the first part is free.  It doesn't include a lot, but if you have some patience, there is enough to get a feel for what is on offer and decide if you want more.\n\nI have tried both Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom Experience this past week.  My first impression was that Assetto Corsa was better.  It cetainly has the better interface and the option to set up the cars to some degree is attractive.  RR3 has some problems with it's server and the current Nvidia drivers, but, while frustrating, these are not major issues, assuming these will be fixed in the near futures.  Both simulations promise multiplayer options, although it looks like the RR3 option will be limited to the DM Experience DLC for now.  For me the availability of the DM Experience tips the odds in favour of RR3 for the moment, but I'm happy to follow both for now and see what the future brings.\n\nOne final word regarding control options.  I haven't tried either simulation with a mouse/keyboard option and I don't think this would be much fun.  A PC xbox 360 controller is what I am using at the moment and I find it adequate for the for the 'amateur', as opposed to 'novice' level of skill.\n\n\n\n","April 18, 2014","true","42.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is not an arcade game, it is not Gran Turismo or Need for Speed.  To get the most out of this game will require a wheel and pedal set.  It is free but only comes with basic content, the rest is paid but it is enough to try it out -  more content is very reasonable and there are no microtransactions or subscription.\n\nPlayers include professional race car drivers.  To be the fastest person he will take a lot of doing.  Not really for people who don't love driving race cars and don't mind being beaten a lot.  There are no street cars in this game.  There are ongoing competions and many many hotlap leaderboards.\n\nI have been sim racing for a long time and at the moment this and Game Stock Car are all I want to play.\n\nIf you play this for 6 minutes with a keyboard and then hate it because you are struggling instead of winning everything in sight as on an EA game leaving a bad review is unfair.  Note that these people are in the multiplayer on the free content and if you are worried the other multiplayer is a lot cleaner although there is no safety rating system as yet.\n\nIf you like driving realistic race cars get this game.","September 7, 2015","true","94.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is essentially a base game with a couple cars and tracks. Extra tracks and cars must be bought. Raceroom is constantly being updated with new content, if you want to buy stuff wait until it goes on sale. Everything eventually will go on sale for at least %50 off.

That being said..I just got this game today and for this being early access and only having 5 cars and 3  tracks (with about 4-6 variations on each track) to start off freely... THIS GAME IS AMAZING. The physics and force feedback on my G27 are just spot on.\n\n1. Graphics - 8/10 - There are prettier games out there.. but lets face it.. its early access and they still look great.\n2. Sound - 10/10.. Ive never heard such satisfying superchargers, turbos and crunching suspensions in a game to this day.\n3. Physics - 10/10 - Somehow they really make you feel every little bump, dip and lateral movement better than any racing game i've played to date.\n4. Car Setup - 7/10 - This is the only part that feels lacking, Being early acess we can only hope it improves.\n5. Multiplayer -10/10 Ive played it all morning and loved every minute of it. There are of course all the drivers who do not have respect for others, im sure its just the flood of "free to play" players trying the game out. Its very competetive in real sim mode with no racing lines available making you pay close attention to your speed and braking points.

RaceRoom Racing Experience (R3E). Newer, better native support. If you play it though, expect having to dish out the dough for getting a amazing experience. $40 dollars can get you (if stuff is on sale, which is regularly is) 10-15 tracks, and 5-10 cars, some in "packs." The physics is great, the controls are amazing (I'm on a XBOX 360 controller), and the game just feels perfect. Personally I love the competitions of where its just you and the track and you try to get the best time out of EVERYONE. But you have to pay for everything.\n-vs-\nQuantity? Race07. Older game, but still holds up to date, if you want this game, get the SimBin Mega Bundle (same $40 dollars!) and get all the DLC and its 15$ less then buying all of them alone. The game has it's quirks and could have been better but is still an amazing racing game none-the-less. But it has loads and I mean LOADS of tracks and a nice array of cars.\n\nYou choose, and don't go hating on this game.

There is a cost to buy tracks but you dont have to buy all of them just pick the ones you want, unlike some of the other reviews this wont cost much. Give it a try, there seem to be regular updates, for the free to play price its worth a shot\n\nUpdate\n\nI bought the DTM Experience DLC and i love it, best touring car game i have played since TOCA days. Racing is competitive and challengine, tracks are great and physics are good. I am still dissapointed thatht the main game only has time trial type events, no single player races or multi player races, but DTM Experience is great.","September 12, 2013","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It really is a very high quality racing simulator especially considering it is free. A little too far down the realism spectrum for my liking though. The main problem is that there is no sense of accomplishment or incentive to keep playing. In most racing games you win races to unlock new tracks and cars which keeps you wanting to play on. But here you unlock new stuff by buying it. Also the races them self are just against the clock. There is very little sense of accomplishment from just moving a few places up the leader boards. So as I say I think this is one to keep an eye on as more content become available.","April 21, 2013","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ernie111/recommended/211500/","ernie111","e.r.n.i.e","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ernie111/","53 products in account","*** German translation in comments section / Deutsche Übersetzung als Kommentar ***\n\nFirst of all, my review is based on playing R3E with a wheel (Fanatec GT3RS v2 + Clubsport Pedals v1) and in "GetReal"-mode only. So the FFB + physics part may not match the driving experience of gamepad users. The driving at other difficulty levels (Novice or Amateur) may also differ.\n\nGraphics:\nThe overall graphics are quite nice, but sometimes the whole scenery looks a little bit "cartoony". Maybe it lacks better shaders to give the graphics a more real touch. Nevertheless i like the graphics, but improvements are always welcome.\nThe available tracks are well-made. As a sidenote .... i like the swaying trees. These small details adds to immersion.\nBig immersion breaker: The big colored distance markers!\nI hope Simbin brings us an option soon to replace these arcade-style signs with realistic corner/brake/distance markers.\n\nSound:\nActually R3E has the best sound of all available Simracing titles (incl. the Simulations in beta-, alpha-, pre-alpha-status). But iRacing and pCARS are on the way to close the gap (or are on par with some cars). It seems that more and more developer have recognized now the important role of realistic sounds to improve the immersion.\nJust a small point of criticism: In external TV-cam the engine should be a little bit louder and lasts longer on departure.\n\nForce Feedback:\nIMHO the FFB is one of the things which needs to improve in R3E. The whole system with different "FFB effects level" and its canned effects is kinda old school. It seems that there's too much "ancient" ISI-motor stuff in use. (BTW ... Reiza Studios demonstrate greatly with Game Stock Car 2013 what is still possible with the aged physics engine)\nThe FFB effects should come right from the physics (suspension + tires). Just like RealFeel-FFB or/and LeoFFB plugins for rFactor. All these canned effects e.g. for rumblestrips aren't necessary, if the FFB would come direct from the physics. Furthermore some of these canned effects settings makes it more difficult to get the FFB feel right.\nAlso the default controller files aren't that good out-of-the-box. For most players it is necessary to play with all the FFB parameters to find some settings, whereby you feel comfortable with. And there are a lot of these FFB parameters, which actually aren't accessable via the GUI. It might be not an easy "Start & Race" and this could discourage R3E newcomers.\n\nPhysics:\nGoes a little bit hand in hand with the FFB. If the FFB is badly configured you can't get the right feel for the car/physics. But if you find some good settings for your wheel, then the physics come to live too.\nA few times the word "simcade" was mentioned within the community. I'm not agree with that. Many of us are used to the older sims (e.g. GTR2, rFactor1, etc.) and its kind of "low grip feeling", which makes you believe that race cars are very difficult to drive. But that's not the case. Race cars are well balanced and build to give you tons of grip, and not to kill the driver in every corner. Only driving on the limit makes it difficult and will separate the winners from the losers. ;) I think that R3E has implemented this grippy track feeling very well. That's not a reason to call R3E not a sim (or "simcade").\n\nMultiplayer:\nNot yet available. Only leaderboard challenges where you can race against ghost cars (recorded by other players) are possible at the moment.\nFurthermore there are actually almost no official informations about the planned multiplayer features for R3E.\n\nF2P, Content & Pricing:\nFree2Play but actually not much free content. Even if there are almost constantly competitions and try-before-you-buy events, but a little more free stuff would be good.\nReferring to the not-free content, i think the prices for cars and tracks are quite fair. You can drive a car for years and have much fun on a well-made track, and now compare it with the small fee you must pay for it. Otherwise .... if you want all the tracks and cars, it might become very very expensive. I would like to see some bundled packs as special offer from Simbin.\nWhat i didn't like is the Livery-part. I have always liked to paint my own car skins. Now i have to pay for a livery and the available real liveries do cost too much. And if you buy a car, i would appreciate that 2-3 liveries (different ones and not only a changed numberplate) are included at least, just to have a basic choice. Look at the leaderboards ........ almost every driver is driving the provided standard livery. And now imagine some multiplayer races later on, where almost everyone is driving the same car skin.","February 12, 2014","true","115.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","11"

Over all I like this game, its very easy to pick up, very good graphics and physics, and enjoyable, I only have the DTM add on so far and am enjoying it greatly, I've tried playing with both gamepad and steering wheel and the enjoyment is there for both. what I dont like is the amount of DLC's you end up paying for, I really wish the games industry would migrate away from this, unfortunately this game is by far the worst I have in my steam account for this, and the main reason I havent bought more packs. overall yes its a good game, the multiplayer states its still in alpha, so there are better games out there, personally iracing does what this lacks very well. as for Ai, I hate to say it but Project cars probably has the best AI I have come across in a modern racing game. For those who havent got this game yet, should you get it? yes, but choose a DLC pack that you will like and stick with, dont go crazy buying all the packs.","August 5, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Either way, I'd still give this game so far a 6.5 out of 10.\n\n\n\n[Edit] I won't change my mind about this game being pretty good for being free, however, it sucks that most cars cost real money, and what sucks most is that the loading screen for each race is so extremely long, it seriously take about 2-5 minutes each time you want to do a race, whenever it's for testing out a car, practice or even real race. From a 6.5 out of 10, it takes a spring down to 4.8 out of 10 just because of the long time on loading screen.\n\nWhat also sucks enormously is sometimes when you slide, even the slightst, it's almost impossible to recover from that almost regardless of what car you drive, it's very arcade-ish that part and it takes away a lot of the great racing feeling, because it feels like you're driving on a crappy Need For Speed game...","March 2, 2015","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Actually i would not recommend to play it without any proper controller. There are 3 difficulties:\n-Get Real: Its not possible to go around a track without spinning\n-Amateur: Its kind of okey with keyboard, but the traction control will ruin a lot of your laps\n-Novice: I havent tried it, cause it contains a braking assistant.\n\nThe sad thing was, that if the car started to slide, there was basically no chance of properly holding it. Most of the times opposite lock and throttle lift felt like they have no effect at all. In amateur difficulty all cars I tried had horrible understeer ( barely any tiresqueel, though ).\n\nThe menu system is not userfriendly. If you are used to normal, traditional GUI, then you will have a hard time finding things. After 5 hours of play its still strange, not comfortable to use.\n\nOn the bright side: The game looks amazing. The challanges can make the game addictive ( so you can find entertainment/motivation to play for  years ). The cars noises and twitches make the atmosphere amazing. You can really feel like you are in the car. In Get Real difficulty there are a lot of settings you can change on the car, so simulator fans can be happy.\n\nSummary: I recommend this game for a try, maybe you will love it. Steering wheel is very much needed.","July 23, 2014","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Big shake ups went on at Simbin and the company is now called "Sector 3". But more than that, whoever it was that made the majority of the wrong decisions about this game must either be gone or he/she has seen the light.\n\nI have changed my review to reflect the great advances this game made. I will also write a more comprehensive review at some point in the future, but for now suffice to say that this game should be in every race enthusiast library.\n\n-------------------OLD REVIEW BELOW-------------------------------\n\n\n\nIt pains me not to reccomend this game. I own every single Simbin game ever published and I still race in a GTR2 league with weekly races where we manage to have 30 to 40 rivers per 1h or 1:30 hour race. Every week, year around.\n\nNaturally, GTR2 is showing its age, but it is still the only racing simulator with day/night transitions, full pit experience, large fields and all the other features that make a simulator awesome.\n\nWe waited for GTR3 for a long time and we were very excited by Simbin early previews of their new sound engine. It was truly something to behold.\nThen GTR3 fizzled and Raceroom Racing Experience came out as a "free to play" game. Initially I was quite impressed. The sound was awesome and far superior to anything else out there. The graphics, while not the best, were better than their latest offering (the Race07 series). The car handling was OK. Nothing too advanced, but passable.\n\nEven as a free to play game it had promise and initially we belived it would become something at least playable if not a substiotute for GTR2.\n\nAfter the launch, which only included hotlapping as an activity and an "Apex hunt" game that, while a good training tool, seemed forced and certainly no substitute for the missing features. However, since it was a new game  I even purchased about $70 of content, betting on the upcoming and promised availability of AI cars and multiplayer.\n\nWhile we knew that as a league we would be looking elsewhere for our future platform, R3 held the promise of being a good offering for casiual online racing.\n\nThen time passed and the only new offerings were cars, tracks and ugly, useless "liveries".  The promised AI is still (as of this writing) missing in action and there is no multiplayer to speak of, just boards with hot lapping results.\n\nThe choice of available cars goes from the uninspired (cars that every sim seems to have) to some unique cars that are indeed exciting, except that they all seem to drive like one another.\n\nFrankly, if I could go back in time I would buy only the Zacspeed Ford and the additional hillclimb track. The free cars are OK, with the BMW hillclimb car being the best of the lot and the hillclimb challenge is really the only bright spot in this game. Considering that the BMW and the hillclimb are free, I would suggest thst if you like the genre you download this game, but don;t buy anything else. Maybe the other hillclimb track and a car or two that you fancy. All the rest is just repetitive and uninteresting.\n\nThere is no weatehr, no day/night transitions, no pit stops, no telemetry to speak of, even the liveries, which are not free and there is no way to design your own, are ugly.\n\nTo me it is truly unbelievable that a company like simbin released this stillborn game. It could have been so much more, but in truth, they fooled me into spending more than double what I ever paid for GTR2 so maybe they made their money from me for the next two years. But no more. They released a DTM game that suffers from the same limitations (it has AI, but it is very weak) and for the first time since I ahve been simracing I did not buy it.\n\nMaybe one day they will come to their senses and they will offer the same features as GTR2 offered almost 10 years ago. Maybe they'll relent anmd let players create their own liveries and the promised "Adaptive" AI will really be what they promised. Maybe one day you'll be able to compete against other humans online too, and maybe even at night and in the rain. Maybe.\n\nWhen that happens, buy this game. Until then, perfect your hillclimb skills (that is really a lot of fun) and save your money.","January 19, 2014","true","349.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Over all I like this game, its very easy to pick up, very good graphics and physics, and enjoyable, I only have the DTM add on so far and am enjoying it greatly, I've tried playing with both gamepad and steering wheel and the enjoyment is there for both. what I dont like is the amount of DLC's you end up paying for, I really wish the games industry would migrate away from this, unfortunately this game is by far the worst I have in my steam account for this, and the main reason I havent bought more packs. overall yes its a good game, the multiplayer states its still in alpha, so there are better games out there, personally iracing does what this lacks very well. as for Ai, I hate to say it but Project cars probably has the best AI I have come across in a modern racing game. For those who havent got this game yet, should you get it? yes, but choose a DLC pack that you will like and stick with, dont go crazy buying all the packs.","August 5, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It really is a very high quality racing simulator especially considering it is free. A little too far down the realism spectrum for my liking though. The main problem is that there is no sense of accomplishment or incentive to keep playing. In most racing games you win races to unlock new tracks and cars which keeps you wanting to play on. But here you unlock new stuff by buying it. Also the races them self are just against the clock. There is very little sense of accomplishment from just moving a few places up the leader boards. So as I say I think this is one to keep an eye on as more content become available.","April 21, 2013","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ernie111/recommended/211500/","ernie111","e.r.n.i.e","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ernie111/","53 products in account","*** German translation in comments section / Deutsche Übersetzung als Kommentar ***\n\nFirst of all, my review is based on playing R3E with a wheel (Fanatec GT3RS v2 + Clubsport Pedals v1) and in "GetReal"-mode only. So the FFB + physics part may not match the driving experience of gamepad users. The driving at other difficulty levels (Novice or Amateur) may also differ.\n\nGraphics:\nThe overall graphics are quite nice, but sometimes the whole scenery looks a little bit "cartoony". Maybe it lacks better shaders to give the graphics a more real touch. Nevertheless i like the graphics, but improvements are always welcome.\nThe available tracks are well-made. As a sidenote .... i like the swaying trees. These small details adds to immersion.\nBig immersion breaker: The big colored distance markers!\nI hope Simbin brings us an option soon to replace these arcade-style signs with realistic corner/brake/distance markers.\n\nSound:\nActually R3E has the best sound of all available Simracing titles (incl. the Simulations in beta-, alpha-, pre-alpha-status). But iRacing and pCARS are on the way to close the gap (or are on par with some cars). It seems that more and more developer have recognized now the important role of realistic sounds to improve the immersion.\nJust a small point of criticism: In external TV-cam the engine should be a little bit louder and lasts longer on departure.\n\nForce Feedback:\nIMHO the FFB is one of the things which needs to improve in R3E. The whole system with different "FFB effects level" and its canned effects is kinda old school. It seems that there's too much "ancient" ISI-motor stuff in use. (BTW ... Reiza Studios demonstrate greatly with Game Stock Car 2013 what is still possible with the aged physics engine)\nThe FFB effects should come right from the physics (suspension + tires). Just like RealFeel-FFB or/and LeoFFB plugins for rFactor. All these canned effects e.g. for rumblestrips aren't necessary, if the FFB would come direct from the physics. Furthermore some of these canned effects settings makes it more difficult to get the FFB feel right.\nAlso the default controller files aren't that good out-of-the-box. For most players it is necessary to play with all the FFB parameters to find some settings, whereby you feel comfortable with. And there are a lot of these FFB parameters, which actually aren't accessable via the GUI. It might be not an easy "Start & Race" and this could discourage R3E newcomers.\n\nPhysics:\nGoes a little bit hand in hand with the FFB. If the FFB is badly configured you can't get the right feel for the car/physics. But if you find some good settings for your wheel, then the physics come to live too.\nA few times the word "simcade" was mentioned within the community. I'm not agree with that. Many of us are used to the older sims (e.g. GTR2, rFactor1, etc.) and its kind of "low grip feeling", which makes you believe that race cars are very difficult to drive. But that's not the case. Race cars are well balanced and build to give you tons of grip, and not to kill the driver in every corner. Only driving on the limit makes it difficult and will separate the winners from the losers. ;) I think that R3E has implemented this grippy track feeling very well. That's not a reason to call R3E not a sim (or "simcade").\n\nMultiplayer:\nNot yet available. Only leaderboard challenges where you can race against ghost cars (recorded by other players) are possible at the moment.\nFurthermore there are actually almost no official informations about the planned multiplayer features for R3E.\n\nF2P, Content & Pricing:\nFree2Play but actually not much free content. Even if there are almost constantly competitions and try-before-you-buy events, but a little more free stuff would be good.\nReferring to the not-free content, i think the prices for cars and tracks are quite fair. You can drive a car for years and have much fun on a well-made track, and now compare it with the small fee you must pay for it. Otherwise .... if you want all the tracks and cars, it might become very very expensive. I would like to see some bundled packs as special offer from Simbin.\nWhat i didn't like is the Livery-part. I have always liked to paint my own car skins. Now i have to pay for a livery and the available real liveries do cost too much. And if you buy a car, i would appreciate that 2-3 liveries (different ones and not only a changed numberplate) are included at least, just to have a basic choice. Look at the leaderboards ........ almost every driver is driving the provided standard livery. And now imagine some multiplayer races later on, where almost everyone is driving the same car skin.","February 12, 2014","true","115.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","11"

However the prices for vehicles and tracks are reasonable and very often additionally discounted. I bought a bunch today at 50% off. The tracks were around $2.50 and cars were $1.00 to $1.50. There is no subscription fee like in iRacing and the content is a lot less expensive but still high quality. If you are looking for a game that you don't have to spend a lot of money on this is an excellent choice. I'm really big into sim racing and this game does a good job in the realism department for the most part. It's worth trying out the free cars and tracks and buying a few if you want to expand your gameplay.","July 17, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ok there are some negative points aswell, such as missing night/day features, weather and multiplayer. Another negative point is that if you want all of the content such as tracks, cars and liveries, you better start saving up some money because it is very expensive. The overall image is good I think but not perfect. It is a developing product so it is improved with every update and the fact that it is more or less free to play ( you can drive 2 cars on one track and participate in challenges) should encourage everyone to at least try it out.

Either way, I'd still give this game so far a 6.5 out of 10.\n\n\n\n[Edit] I won't change my mind about this game being pretty good for being free, however, it sucks that most cars cost real money, and what sucks most is that the loading screen for each race is so extremely long, it seriously take about 2-5 minutes each time you want to do a race, whenever it's for testing out a car, practice or even real race. From a 6.5 out of 10, it takes a spring down to 4.8 out of 10 just because of the long time on loading screen.\n\nWhat also sucks enormously is sometimes when you slide, even the slightst, it's almost impossible to recover from that almost regardless of what car you drive, it's very arcade-ish that part and it takes away a lot of the great racing feeling, because it feels like you're driving on a crappy Need For Speed game...","March 2, 2015","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Awesome free content. Although there's only a few cars to race with, you can try any of the cars in the game for free. There's only a few tracks for free, plenty more if you want to pay.  So far, using the free cars  and the free tracks, I'm definitely hooked! The sound effects are great, the cars sound like the real deal. Far better than most racing games, and in some ways, better than any racing game I've ever played. Yeah, it's that good! The physics are excellent, and you are given 3 choices for general set-up, abs,tcs,etc. I've found a happy medium with the middle choice, it lets me learn the cars and tracks easier. The tracks are beautiful, and have lots of elevation change, rumble strips, run-offs, etc. Again, I've personally only played on three of the tracks. I really like how you can set-up your race with practice and qualifying. This is something that seems lost on console racing games. My only real gripe thus far is the Ai. I've been racing with the adaptive Ai, which for one race was ridiculously easy, then the next race very hard. And going with that was the aggression of the Ai, when I braked a little earlier for a turn and got rear ended and booted from the track. Really? Sometimes damage seems to happen, other times, you can drive into a wall with no consequences. Glitch? But, gripes aside, this is a really well made game, and for free? Amazing! I will most likely end up buying more content when I get bored with the free stuff. I still can't get over the sounds!...","March 15, 2015","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's lots of content and the game is growing bigger step by step. I'm going to dive into some subjects a lot of negative reviews talk about and try and explain my viewpoint on them.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nThe multiplayer is currently still developping. There are dedicated servers, and you can create your own lobbies. Multiplayer at the moment isn't very crowded, however you can have some good and fun races.\n\nPayment model\n\nContrary to the Free to Play tag this game isn't free to play. A better tag would be Free Demo, but it seems this can't be helped. I'm going to compare the game with league of legends, because it's a well known free to play game. In league of legends you earn in game currency for playing, and that currency can be used to buy things. Next to the ingame currency there is a currency buyable with irl money. In RaceRoom, there is no ingame currency, just vRP, which can be bought for irl money. That's also why I don't think the Free to Play tag applies.\n\nNow on to the paymeny model. Paying 50€ upfront for a game and unlocking all the content is very nice, but there will most likely be content you don't like or feel like playing. In RaceRoom, tracks, cars, trackpacks and carpacks can be bought seperately. Say you don't like DTM, but do like GT2, then you can just buy the GT2 cars. One thing to note is that if you want all the items, you'll be looking at a price quite a bit higher than 50€. But to put his into perspective, in league of legends you pay +- 10€ for a champion, in RaceRoom you pay +- 2.5 euro for a car.\n\nI should also note that content can be tested for free, so you have an idea whether or not you like it.\n\nInterface\n\nThe interface has been upadtes, is new easy to navigate and comprehend, but you still need a mouse to be able to quickly navigate menu's\n\nSome personal insight\n\nI do believe you need a wheel to play this game. You can you a gamepad, but then you're just not getting the complete experience.\n\nThe sounds in the game are incredible, especially with the new transmission sound update.\n\nGraphics are great and the game runs on older hardware however there is only Dx9 support if I'm not mistaken.\n\n\nAs an ending I'd say, try the game out, test drive some cars, and if you like it buy some cars you enjoy driving.\n","June 30, 2015","true","69.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It may not have the best visuals among racing games right now but it still looks really good. It's FFB even though not revolutionary is something that you can tweak to suit your preferences and it's fantastic when you do.\n\nIts problem is its annoying "race2play" (a play on "free 2 play") UI and it also only has a very few free cars and even fewer free tracks. I bought its GT Masters and DTM 2014 experiences and, man, those are fantastic. They should make separate games for those (but give it free to us who bought them here in RRE). Or at least let us configure the game to select a default "experience" during startup.\n\nAI in this game seems good. They don't display the "blind AI" or "AI without the I for intelligence" of other racing games and simulations.\n\nCurrently this game is still missing some polish on the HUD elements. Like the sector split times really huge and distracting when we only need to know if we're going faster or slower for the current lap. The position bar's fonts look horrible. Those things are really well done on their older games (Race series) so I hope they could really improve this area of the game. Currently those look ugly in comparison to the rest of the game that I turn them off at the expense of feedback since the game does not have a race engineer to tell you what's going on.","July 12, 2015","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you picked up your brand new 900-1080 degree FFB wheel and you got no money left over, look no further than this gem. The physics are on par with the lazer scaned iracing, and super car fun fest Asseto Corrsa. The begining cars and tracks are fun to learn, and really give you a sense of joy when shaving off 1/4 a second of a hotlap all while realizing how this is meaningless. There are 3 main modes of difficulty: Novice- Babies first racing sim, Amateur- X360 gamepad user, and Get Real- Why am I backwards and why is my front end smashed in? The only complaint is that the DLC is not only hard on the conusmer, it makes finding servers a living hell.

What it lacks in fluid controls though is forgiven for its great amount of detail that SimBin put into the environments and cars. The biggest problem though is that you must be online at all times and only about three to four cars and courses are available to you right away. The other cars and courses must be bought in order to use them.

Simply the most fun you can have with your clothes on. Period. If you love race cars & racing this is as close as you can get to the real thing. They even give you a couple of tracks &  3 cars for free, Whats to complain about. Yes Multiplayer is in alpha. So if you do that then you can expect problems. But the single player game is great against the ai. Works fine & is stable on my Pc. Try it. You won't be disapointed. But as said by others. Buy your upgrades direct from the games website. Not through Steam. You can purchace from your steam wallet. It's not perfect yet there still working on it. But it is good.... Very good! Bought some tracks including one I've actually driven on & it's spot on. When you crash it doesn't even cost you anything!!!! Hell I love this game already & I only had it a few days! Works well with a joystick. So you don't have to spend a fortune on a wheel. Now I've got the thing calibrated good bye life...... :-)\nSure if your looking for arcade forget it. You will hate it. Go and waste your money on something else. Bore your brains out after 15 hours. This will take you that long to get into it. Trust me I'm only just starting. This can only get better, With more tracks coming online all the time it will be alot better. And when they sort the multiplayer........... Bought 7 tracks & 20 cars for £20 so don't believe the doom merchants. Much cheaper from the games website than on steam, This is one game I don't mind paying for DLC''s as it will keep the game in developement. Real world physics. Awesome sound that deserves some decent speakers. And after all they give you so much for free. How you can whinge about that. If it doesn't work on your system then at least it hasn't cost you anything. I have paid good money for other race games that won't even run on my Pc or have no controller support.

You get what you pay for and the quality here outshines any misgivings regarding prices.\nGraphically it's stunning especially with everything turned high and running at 60fps with 22 cars on the track, for which I'm referring to DTM experience, but the hot lapping in the base game with Ai turned on gives you an insight into what the finished game will feel like and in my opinion they have got it spot on.\nI can only assume that the base game is yet to be optimised because I get lower FPS on the same tracks, with only a couple of cars out than I do with the 22 cars in a full race of DTM. Same graphics settings for both but with a 10 fps drop in the base game?\nSounds are incredible, I've never been so engrossed in the sounds of any game as this one and playing with headphones on just highlights the beauty of these cars.\nGameplay is great especially on the Get Real setting, althought the Ai needs a little bit more speed as its currently too easy to catch and overtake.\nI'm currently using a Razer Sabertooth gamepad and once setup it works perfectly but I can only imagine how much more fun a steering wheel would make this and it's the game which will likely push me to make that commitment.\nIt's that good that I've bought pretty much most of the buyable stuff, except for a couple of livery options, within just a few days of trying it.\n\nEDIT : May 26th 2016\n\nAfter having set myself up with some decent hardware to get the most out of driving games I can say that this is my favourite driving experience on the PC. I own most if not all of the PC racing sims but there's something about Raceroom that makes it very special to me, and that's the feeling you get from the overall atmosphere that this sim creates. From the sounds to graphics to driving feel, once set up correctly this is such a cool experience with AI that can keep up and give you a thrilling racing experience.","April 10, 2014","true","120.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I've really enjoyed the hours I have spent on it so far.\n\nThis is the short version of the review:\nPros\n+The sounds are superb\n+The graphics are nice\n+The car handling is very good\n+The tracklist is seems very cool\n+The carlist is very good (Only racecars, mind you)\n+The menus are easy to use\n+The in-game interface is easy to understand\n+Extremely detailed tuning\n+The AI is good\n\nCons\n-Very limited in cars and tracks if you do not pay for them\n-You need a gamepad or steering wheel to enjoy the game\n-Tyres seem to last unrealisticly long (Might just be me, I am not experienced in real racing)\n-Damage can only be enabled on the hardest difficulty (For explanation, see below)\n-The pit menu is a bit fiddly\n\nThis is the longer version of the review:\nRaceRoom is a very good simulator racing game. This is how it works:\nThere are three difficulty settings. Novice, Amateur and GetReal.\nNovice is the easiest. It has Traction Control, Anti-Lock Brakes and Auto Braking.\nAmateur is the middle ground. It only has TC and ABS.\nGetReal surely does what is says. It gets real. No assists enabled.\nGetReal is only usable for those with a gamepad or a steering wheel. On a keyboard is utterly useless.\nThere is a damage model, but it can only be used in the "GetReal" mode, which seems odd to me. In the "GetReal" mode, you can choose if you want mechanical damage, only cosmetic or none at all. The game also includes a penalty system for corner cutting. You can set it to different kinds of penalties. A slow down penalty, a drive-through penalty or a stop-and-go penalty (Be aware, you'll have to select to serve it manually. Just driving through the pits to serve a drive-through won't work).\nWhen you don't pay any money you get acces to three tracks and seven or eight (could be wrong, might be less) cars. Two circuits and one hillclimb course. You can test drive any car you like as many times as you like, but only on a specific track. For the test drive, you can select the difficulty mode. You cannot test drive the tracks, which I think is odd.\nThe game sounds fantastic and looks very good as well.\nThe tuning in the game is unbelievably detailed and quite frankly scarily detailed. I daren't touch it.\n\nOverall, I think it is a great simulator which everyone interested in racing should give a try.\n\n(This line of text contains some extra love for the people who read the review this far. I've put more time than I should have into this review)\n\n","March 5","true","18.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

First there is only one track you have to choose from as far as I can see and you have to pay for the rest of them and I use Aussie Dollars not USD, so that makes it even harder for me to buy the game currency. Second there are only two cars you start off with, the Aquila and the BMW. There both great I can tell you that but the Aquila has just poor steering and same goes with the BMW. Third I don't know how to earn the game currrency so that is a big problem for me. Last it said 2 hours to install and it took 7 hours and I had to wait a day for it to fully load.\n\nI would recommend this game to car and racing fans but just look out for poor steering because the first track you use has a few hard turns and you have to really judge you turning because the turn, most of the time is hard to make and when your in first person view you see the steering wheel only turn a small amount not going in a full rotation like other games. You also have to wait a couple of seconds before the cars goes from N to D or N to R.\n\nOverall I did enjoy the game but its just those few problems that took some of the joy out of playing the game. I would give this game a 6.5/10.","January 19, 2014","true","3.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

I’m not a professional racer, I don’t know what it sounds like to be behind the wheel of one of these monstrosities, but when I play a racing game with a 5.1 surround system I expect it to feel raw and powerful. Instead, I found all of the vehicles to sound unbelievably anemic and whiny. Again, I have no idea what these cars may sound like in real life, but this is a game. It’s disappointing to see such aggressive speed machines yet hear whiny little RC cars.\n\nNow one of the first things I learn was that this is (at least in some capacity) the same people responsible for Race07. I recently gave that game a whirl and had a nauseatingly terrible experience with it. Whatever they learned from those past titles they have clearly refined it and mastered it for RaceRoom. I know a lot of time has passed between the two, but it’s hard to think this quality sim is from the same people behind Race07. Great job, devs; keep up the iteration and self improvement!\n\nThe next thing I took a step back from complaining about was the Free-to-Play model. Many of the negative reviews pointed out the frankly incomprehensible way in which content is being sold. I think the model is confusing and poorly thought out, but I don’t think the fact that you are expected to pay for the majority of the cars when the game and a handful of vehicles are completely free is a point to merit a negative review. The game is extremely detailed and - as best I can tell - extremely faithful to the physics behind circuit racing. RaceRoom isn’t a Free-to-Play racing game in my eyes; it’s a demo for a well crafted racing simulator that allows you to pay for exactly the content you want if you decide that the mechanics interest you.\n\nI didn’t much enjoy it, but RaceRoom Racing Experience is a free demo for a very high quality racing simulator. If you’re into this genre and like what you see in the screenshots, you should absolutely try out the game. There is literally nothing to lose by trying it out.","October 7, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has amazing graphics, physics and sounds. It runs smooth but there's one flaw and it's somewhat big. The real downside of this game is it's purchasing system and expandability. Remember, this game is free, but in reality, it's not. There is a plethora of cars and tracks, however, you only get a very small handful of each as Free to play. And I mean pretty small where I'd be dying to try the cars and tracks that you would need to buy each one separately, which to me is a gimmick.\n\nOverall, RaceRoom is a great game and all, it's just that the developers had incorporated a very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ expansion system. In my sense, I would've rather paid for the game to get all of the features in place of it being free.","August 7, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But currently it's my favourite,\n\nThe game is free, but you have to pay for content like cars and tracks. Considering that you probably will have a few favorite rides and some favourite places to race, you don't need to buy everyting, and with that in mind the pricing is reasonable (just buy a points package and get the content you are interested in). To get everything you have to spend a significant amount of cash, but it's still cheaper than playing iRacing or something like Project CARS / Assetto Corsa with all DLC considering the amoutn of content that is available.\n\nNow for the game itself. The graphics are good, though not mind blowing, but considering that you will be focused on turning that wheel and operating the pedals, you will forget about visuals fast. The sound on the other hand is the best in the market hands down.\n\nHandling is fairly realistic, though not hardcore difficult like rFactor 2, with good Force Feedback once configured properly. Though it is possible to enhoy the game with a controller, a wheel is highly recommended.\n\nNow for the sweet parts - contrary to other sims, there is a good combination of cars and tracks. You will not see stuff like 1 car per class or useless roadcars that go slow and spin out all the time - no Ferraris and SLS AMGs, no drifting. This is all about racing. And racing is good. The AI is one of the better ones, so you will not get divebombed by crazy maniacs all the time, and the difficulty setting will accomodate players of all skill levels. Not the best AI in the market, but quite good and most of all fun,\n\nThe bad stuff? No night racing or rain. Not really a big deal, since in other sims these types of races a cool to look at, but mostly hard and frustrating. Perhaps the biggest issue to me is the lack of a dynamic racing line, where the track rubbers up in places where cars drive and you have more grip there. Not really a problem, but once you try something like this in rFactor 2, you do notice it other games. Raceroom also lacks open-wheelers and does not have many classic cars, but that is to change soon. Another thing is a full flag rules system is still to be addes at some point.\n\nAll in all, of all the new generation of racing sims, Raceroon seems most fun thanks to a good selection of cars and tracks and good AI. If you are looking to get into simracing this is defo the game to try. Other sims might have better graphics or laser scanned tracks, but not the AI Racerrom has nor the amount of actual racing content we see here.\n\n","September 11, 2015","true","33.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The sound is amazing and the physics need just a little improvement. The tracks look amazing and the tracks made by the developer are fun and challenging. My only major critisism is the AI which is a long way in my opinion from being complete, they will ram you time and again if you're on a turn and they accelerate faster than you. The control system could use a little work and be more descriptive on how the sensitivity settings for controller (using a wired Xbox 360 controller until I can afford a descent steeling wheel rig) because after many sessions of tweaking the settings for steering acceleration I am still lost on how the settings affect my controller. Other than that this game is definitely worth a try if you are looking into Racing Sims. 9/10","December 18, 2014","true","10.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I hope that RaceRoom emulates it more and more as I'm sure it will.  Raceroom itself is still in beta and therefore it doesn't have much other than doing practice sessions with AI.  I took advantage of a sale recently and got all RaceRoom content for about $70.  That's a few dozen cars and 15-20 tracks I think.  That's a great price especially compared to another race sim that I've spent about $1,000 on (iRacing).  RaceRoom is a lot of fun.\n\nDTM is a little lacking in content (no pit stops, no rain, no mp) but some of that should come later.  At least I know the multiplayer will.  Even though it's lacking in content it is one very, very good racing simulation.  I highly recommend it.","January 2, 2014","true","107.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I’m not a professional racer, I don’t know what it sounds like to be behind the wheel of one of these monstrosities, but when I play a racing game with a 5.1 surround system I expect it to feel raw and powerful. Instead, I found all of the vehicles to sound unbelievably anemic and whiny. Again, I have no idea what these cars may sound like in real life, but this is a game. It’s disappointing to see such aggressive speed machines yet hear whiny little RC cars.\n\nNow one of the first things I learn was that this is (at least in some capacity) the same people responsible for Race07. I recently gave that game a whirl and had a nauseatingly terrible experience with it. Whatever they learned from those past titles they have clearly refined it and mastered it for RaceRoom. I know a lot of time has passed between the two, but it’s hard to think this quality sim is from the same people behind Race07. Great job, devs; keep up the iteration and self improvement!\n\nThe next thing I took a step back from complaining about was the Free-to-Play model. Many of the negative reviews pointed out the frankly incomprehensible way in which content is being sold. I think the model is confusing and poorly thought out, but I don’t think the fact that you are expected to pay for the majority of the cars when the game and a handful of vehicles are completely free is a point to merit a negative review. The game is extremely detailed and - as best I can tell - extremely faithful to the physics behind circuit racing. RaceRoom isn’t a Free-to-Play racing game in my eyes; it’s a demo for a well crafted racing simulator that allows you to pay for exactly the content you want if you decide that the mechanics interest you.\n\nI didn’t much enjoy it, but RaceRoom Racing Experience is a free demo for a very high quality racing simulator. If you’re into this genre and like what you see in the screenshots, you should absolutely try out the game. There is literally nothing to lose by trying it out.","October 7, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But in reality the way it is now it doesn't work out. The pricing is not clear and fair enough. The public multiplayer community is split and barely alive. There is not enough going on online to justify buying the content. I was torn between giving the game a thumbs up or down. But from my personal point of view it all comes down to the questionable business model imposed by the publisher which keeps the game from being populated and more successful.

RaceRoom Racing experience is an ok racing game, even if it does feel rough around the edges. I am not sure if its "finished" now or not, I just know it doesn't feel like it. I will say that this review is pretty terrible. I just can't seem to find any of the info I want to put out there. As of now you at least have my opinion.\n\n\nAs of this review: The game looks ok at first, and in all honesty I want to Like RaceRoom Racing Experience but it just feels so, so unfinished. At this point though, with the devs undergoing "restructuring" the future does not look bright for RaceRoom Racing Experience.\n\nThe game in my opinion is not even finished enough to do a positive or negative review, at this time I cant recommend that you play/ get it, but I dont think you should write it off just yet.","August 6, 2014","true","9.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

And I don't play games that much, so for me, that's a lot ;)\n\nIf racing is really something you enjoy, I would recommend you check it out. Probably, a lot of you will ragequit out, because the handling is a thing to get used to. However, with a little bit of practice, even the 2 free tracks are good to drive on, and even when experienced, those tracks are great fun, and still full of challenge.\n\nNevertheless, if racing is not your type of game, this might not appeal to you fully.","April 3, 2014","true","27.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
