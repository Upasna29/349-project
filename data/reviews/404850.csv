It's a nice change-up from the games I normally play, and I can definitely say I want to see more. A mobile port would be nice, too :)\n\nGAMEPLAY:  The gameplay is fine, I have run into some problems whilst playing, but nothing game-breaking (as of yet). The level design is alright, it's not going to make you 'awe' in amazement, but it is fun enough to keep you tied to your chair for an hour or so (depending).\n\nSTORY: DARTHY, who'd just woken up, has to save her 'friends', bound robots; each of these robots are trapped inside of a coin (golden doubloon) waiting to be saved, and it is up to DARTHY whether to save them or not. Will you ignore your friends plea's for help, or will you save them, allowing their souls to go to 'Robot Heaven'(?).\n\n8.3/10\nAlthough I don't have much to go on (not to mention I'm having 'writer's block'), I can say this game is pretty good at what it's intended for. Would be better off in the app store.","December 2, 2015","true","2.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

Even though it sends me into spiraling hate of my life and all the enemies in the game are rage inducing to no end. Personally I'm not a perfect fit for rage game, but DARTHY really pulled me in and continued to encurage me to keep going. Man it messes with you so much by leading you in so many wrong directions. Just need to keep going...keep playing...keep dying... *cries in corner*","March 29","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
