If it would'n have been for my love for point and click and, at times, funny dialogue, I would have probably abandoned the game halfway.\nHaving two characters between which you can switch could be a very entertaining approach, The Unwritten Tales and Technobabylon come to mind, but in this game it becomes a dreary must of clicking on everything twice with very unsatisfying results.\nOf course, those games are 5-10 times more expensive, so if you really love point&click, it could be worth buying, if only to support the trend for this type of games.\n\nWhat I hated most about the game is the way it takes the least endearing features of P&C and make them nerve-grating. And I am refering here to:\n- The pixel hunting. the backdrops are very dark which makes it hard, at times impossible, to spot the objects you have to pick up\n- Big inventory - you will pick up a lot of junk objects you will never need to use, so you'll have a big, mostly useless inventory\n- Artifical, random puzzles - That I consider the worst of all. 90% of the game you will go about not knowing what you are supposed to do and why you are doing it. Many puzzles can only be solved only with the walkthrough, because there is no logical connection you can make. The whole game is mainly a string of not story-related puzzles which are neither smart nor entertaining to solve. One, for example, is all about clicking at random with both characters. Figure that...\n\nIf a game is not entertaining, then it loses its purpose and that is why I cannot recommend it.","July 16, 2015","false","21.6"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","41","47","2","0"

Still, it is indeed a point-and-click adventure game that can actually be fun.\n\nPros\n* Nice characters. I really liked Aaron - his sense of humor is exceptionally witty. And the way the heroes always quarrel between themselves - well, you can tell by that the ending would be wedding-style.\n* Achievements based on mostly optional actions and 1000 Sierra-style points you can get. However, I would not get them all without a walkthrough :)\n* Quite good length for such a price - there are more expensive adventures in Steam that last much less.\n\nCons\n* The story is too loose. You get a lot of 'deus ex machina' story turns without much logic or explanation. Yes, there is a good message as for the current sorry state of the humanity, but it is hidden amongst some vague aliens and conspiracy theories.\n* The graphics could be much better. Most locations are too dark and simplistic.\n* Puzzles sometimes lack logic. And what is more - the good idea of having two characters with different 'superpowers' under our control is poorly realized. There are maybe only two puzzles that require coordination (with the heroes just standing on two buttons) - and we never get to use their superpowers by our own (only automatically and in predefined places).\n\nSorry, but 'The Apotheosis Project' is not the game it could be if all its potentials were realized. Still, I would say it is a decent game that could be recommended to adventure fans.","August 23, 2015","true","8.8"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

The story is overall pretty weak and nonsensical. It's never really clear what the characters' actual job is and the superpower plot is kind of pointless, and the whole thing is drawn together into an incredibly bizarre and unsatisfying ending (full disclosure I got about 840 points so maybe the 1000 points ending is better). The dialogue tries really hard to be clever and funny but usually fails.\n\nThe art is serviceable, nothing special but fine for the price range. However the backgrounds can be pretty murky and with the amount of pixel hunting that you're going to have to do that might get irritating quickly. The voice acting is so bad that I'm pretty sure that the game would have been better off un-voiced. Every actor pronounces certain words (particularly "apotheosis" but also a few others) differently from one another, or sometimes the same actor will pronounce a word differently from scene to scene. The VA for Pandora speaks like she was being paid by the hour and is trying to draw the recording session out as long as possible.\n\nIn that "modern people making a classic point & click" way, there is a LOT of pixel hunting, and some really nonsensical puzzles (this is a wee spoiler but there is a scene where you convince a character to purchase something from you that they didn't want to purchase previously because it "looks low quality" by peeling a "high quality" sticker off a stripper pole and sticking it to the item). Most of the time there is no real need for the two characters to both be present, and I think the game could have expanded a lot on puzzles that required both characters to complete. As it is, there's this weird sort of artificial division of labor so that both characters are required, so one character is too weak to open a drawer, can't follow simple instructions to operate  a machine and refuses to talk to like half of the characters because they're "too scary" and the other character is like "I am too busy to read what's written on this paper".\n\nAt this price point the game was okay (like it wasn't actively bad really) but I can't muster up the interest to replay it and try to get more points so I can't really recommend it.","July 24, 2015","false","3.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

What they don't know, is that they are used as guinea pigs in an scientific experiment in which their DNA has been changed. They are send on a mission to obtain a certain relic. Everything goes wrong, they are captured and their special powers are released. Aaron is able to tranport them to another dimension. They have to get back, unravel the conspiracy and put the responsible ones to justice.\n\nAs you guessed by the above, The Apotheosis Project is a science fiction spy adventure game. The story is well told in small doses throughout the game. You can easyly identify yourself with Aaron en Penelope as they discover the harsh truth about the people they trusted and worked for. In spite of that, they never lose their sense of humor and interest in one another as is clearly shown in the well written dialogs.\nThe game is fully voiced and the actors do the best they can to act naturally. At first the voice of Pandorra seems strange and irritating, but in the end you fully understand why she talks the way she does. The voices of Aaron and Penelope are well performed. I don't know about the English gram (as I'm Dutch), but everything they said was clear and understandable. Background music is good and underlines the overall atmosphere of the game.\n\nThe Apotheosis Project is an indie game, made without a big budget and expensive software. Taking that in consideration, the graphics are not bad at all. The main characters move smooth and the cut scenes fit nicely. Sure, the backgrounds are dark, but then the alternative world isn't bright and shiny, so it fits to the atmosphere. And darkish or not, they are well made and full of details.\nThose details are part of the fun. Yes, that means pixelhunting. After all, the agents are in a strange world and have to solve pratical problems like opening a door or convincing people to give information. So they look around for objects which could be usefull one way or another, now or in the future. They find a lot of junk, but even that will turn out to be part of the game. Try to get 1000 points and you know why.\n\nAaron and Penelope are both playable characters. You can switch any time from one to another. They have there own inventories, but you can always give any object personally to the other, which is even needed in a specific place.\nControls and puzzles are not complex. Just click and think logically. Use your eyes and wits in solving problems and deceiving people and you will have a great time.\nThe Apotheosis Project is certainly a game a would recommend!\n","August 15, 2015","true","6.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Included are also some very rare pixel huntings but those need to be done just by those players, all of which aspire to get all achievements and a perfect score.\n\nThe graphics are pleasant to watch and a nice extra are two playable Characters that can be switched without problems.\nApart from one exception the voice acting is well done.\nI played it with windows 7/64 and had no bugs or crashes during the play or when saving/loading it.\n\nSounds like a cool game for real adventurer to me - that's why I'd like to recommend it.","September 12, 2015","true","15.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

It has potential but misses the mark.\n\nThe story is boring and confusing. You desperately want to fast click through the long, boring intro, then feel you missed something really important when the story seems confusing (HINT: you didn't).\n\nSwitching between characters on this point and click adventure is cool, but the game makes clicking (the point of the game) so damn frustrating.  One character is a major jerk, putting out how stupid you are for "suggesting" certain actions. And there are always unnecessary dialog involved.  You used the keys to open a door?  Don't worry, the character will inform you that you just did that.\n\nThe game has a good feel to it.  The main issue is that it seems that the main goal of the game is to ♥♥♥♥ off the player.","December 20, 2015","false","9.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Reid are agents of Pandora Global Corp., an organization that works in parallel with the CIA. What Penelope and Aaron do not know is that they are also guinea pigs in a secret experiment - the Apotheosis Project - where scientist has tampered with the human DNA. Subjects receive special powers, which are surreptitiously suppressed by antibodies, but can be activated by means of a code word.\nPenelope and Aaron are sent on a mission by Pandora Parlow, the head of the organization, to get a relic. When they meet their contact person all goes wrong and they end up being captured. But, without the antibodies, their special powers beginning to awaken. Penelope discovers that she can raise hazardous energy with her hands and Aaron turns out to be able to trigger changes in time and space.\nThe two end up in a strange world, inhabited by aliens and robots. They discover the secrets behind the Apotheosis Project and its consequences for the entire world.\n\nSTORY & PLAYABLE CHARACTERS:\nThe story is told well dosed. Along with the main characters you'll discover more and more of the plot and the hidden agenda of Pandora. Aaron and Penelope remain well in their character role and handle the problems in their own way, whereby Aaron often tries to lighten up a difficult situation with some light humour. The two clearly like each other, despite their small humorous altercations.\nThey solve the problems they encounter during their adventure together or apart. It is important to let both Aaron and Penelope look at items and have them both to talk to other characters in the game. After all, they both have their own way of understanding, character and qualities. Moreover, you can be earning points along, up to a total of one thousand. It pays to reach that number and it also makes you more mindful of the environment and the story during the game, which benefits the fun of playing this adventure.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe puzzles are logically interwoven into the story. If you want you can obtain helpful information and sometimes even hints during the game. Useful items can be obtained in exchange for another object or by a service on return. While solving situations/puzzles you do need to use your ingenuity.\nDuring your quest you will find many items you can pick up and place in your inventory and use in certain situations, but some of these items are not needed and only serve to confuse a.k.a. red herrings. While playing you're always looking for opportunities to use all of these items and that is a nice addition for the true adventurer.\nYou can, while playing, freely switch between Aaron and Penelope, through a portrait of both in the inventory bar. Sometimes it is even necessary, as Penelope for example encounters a problem that can only be solved by Aaron or vise versa.\nYour inventory folds out if you hoover your mouse-pointer to the bottom of your screen, very pleasant and effective. Naturally, each character has its own inventory, but items are interchangeable between Penelope and Aaron. The object gets stored in the inventory of the character that receives the object.\nWith a mouse click, the two playable characters walk freely and smoothly through the game scene.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nThe in-game environment looks nice. The backgrounds are very detailed and matches the atmosphere and story. A thrift shop is stuffed really messy with silly things and you see the flashing reflection of the neon advertisings while in a rainy street. An office is sleek equipped and on the platform of the subway you see rubbish and graffiti. When in Infraworld, the colours are sober and while in a modern residential tower, the colours are tight and bright. All together this creates a nice, convincing impression.\nMany scenes contain one or two small background animations. The transitions between the game-chapters are shown as a close-up of a three-piece comic and match perfectly with the characters and surroundings.\n\nSOUND:\nThe game scenes contain perfectly fitting background music and certain situations are supported with nice sound effects.\n\nVOICE ACTING:\nThe voice acting is top-notch, done by professional voice actors/actresses.\n\nSTEAM ACHIEVEMENTS:\nIn total there are 35 steam achievements to collect, varying from easy to hard.\nIn total, the game offers 35 steam achievements, obtainable in a nice mix from easy to tough.\n\nCONFIGURABILITY:\nThe game is configurable using winsetup.exe:\n1. Right-mousebutton-click on the installed 'The Apotheosis Project'  title in your game library,\n2. Select ' Properties'\n3. Select ' Browse local files'\n4. Right-mousebutton-click on the file winsetup.exe and select 'Run as administrator' / Double-click the file 'winsetup.exe'\n5. Set/select/change whatever needed\n6. Click button 'Save'\n7. Run game via Steam\n\nSome available and possible useful settings:\n* Set 'full screen' or 'windowed mode',\n* Select Graphics Driver (Direct Draw or Direct3D 9)\n* Select Grahics Filter,\n* Select Scaling,\n* Select Digital sound device & MIDI device,\n* Enable/disable 'Black Borders' (Side, Top & Bottom)\n\nSUMMARY:\nThe Apotheosis Project is a 2D retro indie adventure that comes with hi-res graphics, full voice acting, two playable characters, innovative and varied puzzles in a compelling science fiction story.\n\nSo, should I by this game:\nIf you are in to retro 2D adventure games with modern graphics and a good story/plot:\nYes, this game is for sure worth playing and worth the money. Definitely recommended.","July 25, 2015","true","0.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"
