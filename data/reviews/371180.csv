"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genepoolisstagnant/recommended/371180/","genepoolisstagnant","Earth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genepoolisstagnant/","496 products in account","This is actually a really fun game. I'm having more fun with it than I originally thought I would be.\n\nSuper 3-D Noah's Ark is a labyrinth FPS from the DOS era which used and upgraded Wolfenstein 3D's engine. It added a few cool things like MIDI support and texture-mapped floors and ceilings. This version on Steam has been repolished and ported over to modern operating systems, so now there's no need to use DOSBoX to emulate it!\n\nThe quality of this port is really good. The sound quality has been bumped up significantly, it can play in 1080p with true 16:9 aspect ratio (no stretching), the mouselook feels natural and it supports mods. This release also has achievements and trading cards, which is more than what most re-releases or remakes get.\n\nIn many ways I think this game is actually better than Wolfenstein 3D. The music is better for sure and there's more enemies scattered about, which leads to more action. The level design is smart. While the levels are maze-like, I have an easier time finding my way around and not being completely lost, like I did a lot with Wolfenstein's lack of color and texture variety. So nevermind the somewhat religious theme, as the game barely even touches upon the story.\n\nThe developer of this port is a core developer of ZDoom and ECWolf, and has some involvement with the development of Zandronum. If you play Doom, you likely have already used this guy's work before. The money spent on this game supports the development of the ECWolf engine (the engine this game uses) which will be receiving updates, like online multiplayer. If you take a peak in the forums, you'll understand why this developer is so cool and why he deserves your money. After all, it's just 5 bucks! Which is the same price as Wolfenstein 3D on Steam but without all the fancy upgrades.\n\nIf you were into Wolf3D or Ken's Labyrinth, you're gonna love this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nicktendo64/recommended/371180/","nicktendo64","Spooky Blyat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nicktendo64/","481 products in account","So here it is, the infamous Super 3D Noah's Ark.\nCreated by Wisdom Tree back in the mid 90's for the SNES, completely unlicensed and required you to insert a real SNES cart into the top to bypass the lockout chip.\nWisdom Tree licensed the Wolfenstein 3D engine from iD software, as a result this plays pretty much like your average Wolf 3D total conversion.\n\nSomehow after 20 something years, this game gets a proper port to Windows and is released on Steam. Crazy huh?\n\nThe story goes that the animals on the Ark are restless and want Noah dead, and so Noah needs to go on an epic quest to calm them all down by firing feed at high velocity using a variety of Rube Goldberg inspired feed launching machinery.\n\nSo let's compare this to Wolf 3D.Right off the bat the presentation here is good. The game was originally released on SNES and MS-DOS but here has been ported to Windows using a modern "source port". Sadly this is already better that the official Steam version of Wolf 3D, which is the original EXE slapped into DosBOX.\nWhile it's mostly just asset replacements, since Wisdom Tree had source access there are some new things here. We have an automap (which makes searching the maze-like levels a bit less frustrating), and quizzes (which are all bible trivia).\nIn an effort to make this game non violent, there are no enemy hurt frames, which makes it difficult to tell if you've hit an enemy or not, and also doesn't allow you to cancel enemy attacks. (EDIT: the developer pointed out that enemies attacks can be canceled, just not on bosses)\nMusic here is a bunch of OGGs made out of midi versions of the soundtrack played with some sound font, which kinda adds to the corniness. The music is bland and loops often, which gets really annoying after a while. I wouldn't mind the option to use the original SNES version's music instead.\nThe graphic design isn't great, generally of lesser quality than other games of its era. Some of the weapons partially obscure the view as well. (EDIT: seems I completely missed the option that scales down the feeders to take up less of the screen, whoops)\nSound effects are lower quality and shorter than Wolf 3D's effects, which is understandable considering the SNES's sound capabilities were limited.\nLevel design is similar to Wolf 3D level design, though not as good. Secrets have been made really obvious, probably cause this was meant for kids.\nThough this was made for kids, the difficulty ramps up very quickly and the game eventually turns into a nightmare. Most enemies spit at Noah using a hitscan attack, so the only way to avoid them is to stay out of range and hope RNG takes your side or take cover. Getting hit also deals a ton of damage.\nSo that's a very rough list of what's different here from vanilla Wolf 3D.\nNow, why would you want this game?Nostalgia for the DOS or SNES versions.\nHistorical interest.\nJoke/meme factor.\nYou liked Wolf 3D and wouldn't mind a TC.\nSupporting the ECWolf developer. (who takes the majority cut)\nRumoured future multiplayer update. (pelting other Noahs with feed until they pass out sounds hilarious)\nIf you fall into a couple of the above categories, this game might be for you. If not, you'll probably want to give it a pass.","July 9, 2015","true","2.9"," 86 of 99 people (87%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","87","86","99","11","3"

If you enjoy Wolfenstein 3D, then you’ll be satisfied with this. The game uses the same modification as the ECWolf mod for Wolfenstein, if you’re familiar with ECWolf it’s exactly the same.\nFor my review I wanted to compare Super 3D Noah’s Ark to Wolfenstein and what areas are better or worse.\n\n-Theme-\nIf it wasn’t obvious, this game is a very family-friendly game. Rather than killing enemies you are feeding them to put them to sleep. This is in stark contrast to Wolf3D which was about dropping as many dudes as you encountered. So if the rather light-hearted and, let’s face it, silly nature of the game doesn’t hold a certain charm for you then you probably won’t enjoy it that much.\n\n-Weapons-\nSuper 3D Noah’s Ark and Wolfenstein 3D are pretty similar in terms of weapons and how they function.  Hand feeding is the knife (that is, melee), the small feed launcher is the pistol, the large feed launcher is the machine gun, and the Super Feeder 5000 is the chaingun. What sets this game apart from Wolf3D is that it has two additional weapons: the cantaloupe feeder and the watermelon feeder. Both of these weapons use alternate ammo from the other weapons and actually deal some splash damage. The cantaloupe feeder fires two rounds in sequence which makes it a decent strafing weapon and the watermelon feeder is great for quickly taking down tough enemies.\n\n-Music-\nIt loops quite a bit and isn’t very impressive. It maintains the light-hearted theme of the game and the boss level theme isn’t too bad. Not much else to say about it otherwise.\n\n-Levels/Difficulty-\nSince this game is geared more towards kids, it is understandably easier than Wolfenstein. Secrets are also more identifiable (at least for me they were) and the game generally leaves more pickups laying around for both ammo and health. The game even features scrolls which pose a trivia question about Noah’s ark and reward the player with health. As far as the level design goes, I think the game does a very good job. Some of the earlier levels feel longer than the early Wolf3D levels but the game is considerably shorter than Wolf3D. What really impressed me are the boss fights. At the start of each chapter you are told what animal you will need to put to sleep. The fights themselves have very well designed stages around them. They have plenty of room to fight, spots to hide when things get dicey, additional enemies to distract you/add more challenge, and side rooms to run away from the boss. These fights are surprisingly robust in comparison to Wolf3D’s bosses. So even though most enemies don’t take too much to dispatch, they can sneak up on you and take you out very quick if you are not careful.\n\n-Final Conclusion-\nThe game is good. Get it if you enjoy Wolfenstein 3D and want to see better bosses and more weapons. Don’t get if you don’t like the light-hearted theme or dislike the looping music.","June 23, 2015","true","3.4"," 231 of 340 people (68%) found this review helpful 266 people found this review funny","68","231","340","266","8"

My only qualm is that sometimes the levels can have poorly placed enemies, and unless you know beforehand what to do, you're in trouble, cause those goats hit HARD.

Noah's Ark has been entirely remade from scratch in ECWolf, a source port of the original Wolfenstein 3D engine. As such, Super 3D Noah's Ark has a lot of modern amenities that you wouldn't expect of a 20 year old DOS game: Native compatibility with modern OSes (no DOSbox), support for 16:9 resolutions, non-buggy mouselook functionality, even extra fluff like achievements. The developers did a better job at modernizing this game than iD did with Doom or Wolfenstein; no half-assing at all.\n\nThe game itself is basically Wolfenstein 3D with a biblical coat of paint. If you enjoyed Wolfenstein 3D's gameplay, you'd probably enjoy this as well. The levels are all original, and pretty decently designed. There's a larger selection of weapons over vanilla Wolf3D: In addition to your "pistol" and "machine guns" (various slingshots which you use to propel animal feed), you have projectile weapons which function similarly to the rocket launcher and flamethrower from the SNES version of Wolfenstein. Gameplay is fluid and satisfying, and the game never drops below 60FPS.\n\nIf you're a fan of Wolf3D (or just want to experience a bizarre piece of video game history), this game is worth picking up.","June 23, 2015","true","4.6"," 54 of 72 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","54","72","3","8"

It's literally a Christian Wolfenstein 3D with different wall and floor textures, and Nazis replaced with goats, which you shoot food pellets at at alarmlingly high speeds. No wonder they're angry...\n\nWhile you don't get much more Biblical than Noah, it's not ridiculous with the religiousness, though you do get Bible-themed trivia questions that let you gain items from time to time, so some Old Testament knowledge helps, but it's not massively consequential.\n\nThis game, being an exact copy of Wolfenstein 3D, is just as difficult. Running out of ammo ("feed") absolutely sucks, and you can get your ♥♥♥ kicked fairly easily by these rampaging little horrors at Normal or Hard difficulty.\n\nIt's a very well-done port and very stable.

Instead, it's a juxtoposition of Id/Bethesda's attitude to their classic games on Steam and Piko/WisdomTree/ECWolf. Put frankly, Id and Bethesda don't care about their older properties. Classic Id games like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D have terrible terrible Steam versions not even on par with some console ports. The Steam ports of both are as phoned in as possible, clearly put up just to have them listed on Steam. To make matters worse, they were the first studio to get away with this. Back when there was very little on Steam but Bethesda and Valve properties, Id set the standard for bad ports with these games.\n\nSome background for the unfamiliar, Id Software's engines are among the most free and meticulously documented engines in mainstream gaming. Id, from the beginning, has consistently released the source code to its engines a few years after it stopped making games with each of them. What this means, is that both the Doom and Wolfenstein 3D engines are available as source code, allowing gamers to create versions of the engines that support new platforms, are more stable, and allowing for new features. So this seems like an easy fix right? Go to github, grab the latest stable build of ECWolf or GZDoom and plugin the proprietary files. You end up with a version of both games that runs on Windows, OSX, Linux, iPhone, Android, PSP, DS, PS3, PS2, Xbox 360, Xbox et al.\n\nBethesda and Id didn't do this. They simply released 20 year old windows executables with no patches or bugfixes. These versions are known to be problematic on modern windows, so .bat files and dosbox are also included, which run an even older version of the game. Whatever version you run, it won't support your resolution or graphics card, I hope you enjoy playing these games without a mouse, in software mode, at a crippled or overly sped up framerate, at 480p 4:3, stretched to 16:9 with no way to unstretch it other than changing your monitor settings. No DirectX. No OpenGL. These games don't even know if you have a GPU or not.\n\nAnd then you have Wisdom Tree, the ECWolf devs, and Piko Interactive. Through a licensing collaboration, advanced Noah's Ark specific features were backported to ECWolf by hand. Thanks to relying on the ECWolf source port, the game supports modern hardware, comes defaulted with controls that make sense, supports OpenGL, runs on OSX and Linux, consistently hits 60fps, and runs and looks like butter. Best of all, all of this works without ruining the artstyle or menus of the original game. This is a brillaint port job, and makes Id and Bethesda look like elitist hacks who hate their communities.\n\nThe only reason I can think of for Bethesda's arrogance is toxic proprietary software elitism. Put simply, Bethesda doesn't respect the work that Id has done on these free engines, nor the work by the community, and thinks their terrible dosbox ports better because they aren't maintained by hobbyists. This is a disgusting outdated view, even Microsoft doesn't operate this way anymore, leaving only the games industry to wallow in greed and judgement of its own customers. Worst of all, buying these games on steam is about the only legal way to get the data files needed to run them in a modern engine, so Doom fans will continue to buy them to support Id. This is depressing and unethical, and bethesda should really do something to fix it. My advice is that if you buy them, make sure to leave a negative review.\n\nBravo to Wisdom Tree though for their honesty and open-minded attitude towards Source Ports, though I guess I shouldn't be surprised, Wisdom Tree has been protesting lockouts and licensing for decades.","July 21, 2015","true","0.7"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","23","32","3","0"

For those who don't know. Noah builds an Ark tor the great flood and puts two of each animal inside the ark.\n\nThe game is set inside the ark and your goal is to go around the multiple floors of the ark and find the animals and put them to sleep so they stop causing trouble.\n\nThe game has a rich back story of being one of the most infamous SNES games of all time. Originally Hellraiser the video game it was reworked into this game, with the bible theme around it and was brought into the mainstream by AVGN who made a video on this game.\n\nThe game is nothing more than a Wolfenstein clone and nothing more. You go around a maze like environment, look for keys and go to the next floor. The gameplay is also identical.\n\nThe game is a first person shooter, where you use a slingshot to shoot food into the animals to make them fall asleep.\nLater on you can pick up different types of slingshots, but all that changes is the fire rate. Also you can pick up melon launchers, but those are incredibly useless and you will only use them in dire situations.\n\nThe graphics are alright for the most part. Everything looks crisp as it is updated from the original graphics which is nice, but the level layouts almost always look the same which brings me to my next point.\n\nThe level design is atrocious. Now don't get me wrong Wolfenstein had a lot of this as well, but the way this game does this maze like environment is atrocious. The map doesn't help at all and is pretty much useless in the end. The graphics make everything look the same making it hard to figure out where you've been and where you haven't been.\n\nThe soundtrack is atrocious and it's just best to mute the entire game and to listen to something else while playing.\n\nThe game counter told me it took me 2 hours to finish and that with a lot of trial and error. A lot of the later stages have massive difficulty spikes which make you be as careful as possible.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nSuper 3D Noah's Ark is a mediocre Wolfenstein rip off. It's been called the worst clone out there, but after playing it, I have to disagree. While the game is not good, it's definitely not the worst clone out there when stuff like Nerves of Steel exist.\n\nPros:\n+ Fun Gameplay\n+ Vibrant and Colorful graphics\n\nCons:\n- Terrible Level design\n- Terrible Audio\n- Map system doesn't work\n- Massive difficulty spikes\n\n5/10\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n\n","May 3","false","4.2"," 26 of 41 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","26","41","0","6"

This is a port of a PC game that was also on the SNES (unlicenesed, might I add). There was no real way to play it on modern PCs up till now and even if you could, you probably had some UI problems at the least. When talking about the preservation of games, we often discuss how so many original files were lost;  source code, uncompressed audio etc. While games should be preserved in a better way in order to be played again under the highest possible options (uncompressed audio, original source code, uncompressed cutscenes and textures), some games should just be... preserved,. That's how I feel about Super 3-D Noah's Ark. This game probably took some effort to port over and the devs should be rewarded. But please, enough with the joke reviews because you might actually convince people that this game is any good. Anyone not familiar with it will probably think it's a hilarious joke game when in reality, the company had no intent to do that in their incredibly boring, mindless video game.","June 23, 2015","false","0.3"," 133 of 245 people (54%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","54","133","245","10","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krwakistan/recommended/371180/","krwakistan","Honk Dog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krwakistan/","2494 products in account","So what this is is an old Wolfenstein 3D total conversion that was originally released as an unlicensed SNES cart. I guess there was a DOS version too because it's included with this version. I don't know if the updated version is based on an existing Wolf3D source port (it seems like it might be ECWolf) but whatever it is, it's pretty fantastic. It's got full controller support that's better than what you see in most modern games. It offers full control remapping and you can input custom names on your saved games using a controller (most games struggle with this very basic feature). A wide range of 4:3 and 16:9 resolutions are on tap (4k+ included) with proper aspect ratio scaling options.\n\nAs for the game itself, I haven't yet played enough to speak to the overall quality of its gameplay mechanics, but I'll say this: The first kind of enemy you encounter in Super 3-D Noah's Ark is an angry goat that charges at you in a zig-zag pattern, so it's wilier than a Nazi at least. For that reason alone it seems to be about on par with the game it's based on, one that remains to this day a highlight of the early FPS era. There are no quicktime events.\n\nSuper 3-D Noah's Ark is a quality product that performs better than recent AAA release Batman: Arkham Knight in every regard and is well worth the $5 they're asking for it. This isn't an ironic review and frankly if you think it is then that's on you.

Yes, it is a Wolfenstein 3D engine game with Noah themed visuals but, almost everything else has something interesting about it.\n\nThe levels are, as you expect like Wolfenstein 3D's with mazelike design. The secrets in this game are somewhat easier to find due to most of them having some sort of marking or obvious decoration design.\n\nThe animals (enemies) look to be reskinned Nazis but..... I find the animals to be worse than Nazis sometimes with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t shooting around corners skills.\n\nThe weapons in the game seem to function like their Wolfenstein 3D counterpart but there are two more weapons that are not featured in the original Wolfenstein 3D which would be more akin to a rocket launcher.\n\nTo end with, I do recommend this game if you want to spice up the Wolfenstein 3D formula with variation in enemy and weapon design. I am in no way a religious man and I often get the questions on the scrolls wrong in-game but a manual is included which has the answers in these scrolls if you want to cheat and not brush up on your bible study ;)","June 23, 2015","true","10.1"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","2"

Now if that isn't a title that sells itself, I don't know what is.\n\nS3DNA is a Wolfenstein 3D clone, and before I say anything more, I feel like I should start with: it's actually not bad. In fact, it's pretty decent. If you like Wolfenstein 3D, that is. And I do! Very much.\n\nAll the animals on the ark have grown roudy. As Noah, it's up to you to feed them all (or as many as you have to until you've beaten the six bosses, anyways) so that they'll go to sleep. In order to streamline this process, you'll be shooting the feed at their faces using various slingshots and what-have-you. Basically, what we have here, is a kid-friendly Wolfenstein 3D.\n\nNow, you've probably mostly all seen the Angry Video Game Nerd's review of the original Super Nintendo game. The one that came in a jank bootleg cartridge that required you to plug another game into the top of it because Nintendo never gave the game their approval. If you haven't, here you go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkNvQYiM6bw (skip to 13:17 for S3DNA). What you've seen or will see there is a low-resolution, low-framerate game which doesn't really look like a lot of fun.\n\nThe Steam version is not a straight port.\n\nThis baby has been given a nice spitshine for its new release. It seems that, rather than the original company bringing it over, a fan actually sought and received permission to put this port together and release it for us. The game looks good! I mean, well. It looks like a Wolfenstein 3D clone. And, being on a wooden ship, the environments are mostly brown, though there are more colorful areas here and there. But it looks about as good as all that could look.\n\nThe game runs smoothly, and it seems some work has been put into making it acceptable for PC gamers. There are loads of options which I'm certain wouldn't have been in the original. Controls, audio... I wasn't even expecting display options, but they're there. There are seven options for the automap.\n\nThe level design is also surprisingly competent! The narrow, twisty mazes got annoying towards the middle, but overall it's decent classic shooter fare for anyone who finished Wolf3D and Spear of Destiny and want more, but don't want all the fancy big city modern complications of Doom or Duke Nukem 3D. Or for those people who want a shooter, but also want to answer questions about the Bible and aren't allowed to play anything violent!","August 2, 2015","true","8.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

The 950 year-old man throws himself upon the floor, rolling in agony as Carl the Camel, his perpetrator, begins to “be fruitful” with Noah’s convulsing body.\n\nFading in and out of conscientiousness, Noah realizes that he has been stripped of all his assets and is once again at the beginning of stage 3-5. “Fornicators! Thieves!” Noah shouts while shaking his maimed arm. Kneeling like the humble servant he is, the elderly man initiates in great and wholesome prayer, “Please almighty God, the animals aboard the ark have become increasingly unruly. I need your strength to assist me in my endeavor! I ask of you in all sincerity: LET ME PURGE THE BEASTS UPON THIS VESSEL!” Spontaneously, a BFF9000 (Big Freakin’ Feeder, for those of you less holy) materializes before Noah. “Thank heavens above! With this,” *equipping the massive culinary cannon,* “I can finally prove my worth to you as your steward and remorselessly PURGE ALL THE ANIMALS!”\n\nNoah rises to his feet and charges audaciously into the silver key room. As the pneumatic door seals Noah inside, sounds of hitscan saliva and pellet-spam resonate from within; dolorous cries of both man and beast clash together in wicked melody.\n\n…Then Silence emerges… A heavy ‘thud’ of flesh reports the battle’s closure followed by a chorus of hissing and bleats. Just one more bandage, one more food crate, one more extra life; any of the three could have circumvented Noah’s brutal demise, but this is how Lady Level-Design desired things to be.\n\nPerhaps Noah should have considered save-scumming?\n\nIt’s too late for that now…\n\n***This short tale accurately depicts my epic voyage to complete Super Noah’s Ark 3D 100% (Achievements and All). If this sounds like the suffering you’re looking for, you’ve come to the right place to enjoy your personal purgatory!\n\n~Useless NPC","July 1, 2015","true","31.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","67","10","15","12","0"

If you grew up playing shooters from this era (and have a sense of humor), definitely give this one a try. It's really fun, action-packed and well-designed. It is essentially Wolfenstein 3D, but with improvements such as a map and slightly-better graphics and sound. The soundtrack is original, well-composed and catchy (I find myself humming the music from this game 20 years after playing it for the first time). Sound effects are also completely original (as far as I can tell) and hilarious (especially the sounds made by the melon-launchers). Gameplay-wise, this game is still good when stacked up against its contemporaries (Ken's Labyrinth, Rise of the Triad, Doom, etc.) It requires strafing, key-finding, ammo management, quick aiming and utilizes every other mechanic you wold expect from a shooter in 1994. I cannot recommend this game enough. It's a quirky gem and an awesome example of how good early shooters from the 90s actually were.\n\nSide Note: The enhancements in this version are awesome. Until today I'd never played this game on anything other than my 120MHz Cyrix 686 (32MB RAM, MS-DOS 6, Daytona SIS 6326 8M AGP-based 3D accelerator card).

I was surprised that the game had so many options on resolution and sound and gameplay for a very old game, and the game handles well. It's an old style FPS in a comical nature, and while the game does have several faults, I have to give the developer/remasterer credit: it's brought to the new day rather well. Silly gameplay that isn't on top of its genre, but you'll get a couple of laughs out of it, and it's not bad in the slightest. Reasonable.\n\nGameplay and Video First Impressions:  http://youtu.be/VvWaFMPEzJo\n\nLists:\n+:\nThe remaster/port work here is excellent. A lot of options, a lot of choices, and care was put into this work. It stand above all the older games in many ways that have made their way to Steam.\nSilly premise that actually does the job.

If you love Wolfenstein 3D mainly for its gameplay (which is what matters the most) it's all here. This game is popular to hate, thanks to BS comedy reviews by AVGN and the like. This is a very solid game that plays great, and is a real challenge on the higher difficulties. The levels are excellent too.\n\nFar better than the SNES version, with better graphics, better control, quiz scrolls, ceiling and floor textures, multiple sided enemies, and a particular level on the SNES can't be done 100% due to a bucket sprite being out of place (the level is obviously fixed here). The SNES version, while decent, doesn't hold a candle to this excellent PC game.\n\nThis Steam release is even better, as the source port it uses adds a lot of stuff too, like hi-res, widescreen, smaller weapon sprites, level stats on the map screen, and such.

You can go from 100% health to 0% health in no time flat. The animals are brutal, so you need to use Noah's slingshot to propel food into the mouths of the animals to make them drowsly and put them to sleep, (it's in the Bible. Look it up)! It's a reskin of the original Wolfenstein 3D, so if you enjoyed that classic, you should enjoy this too.

However, does it automatically make it a bad game? To be honest, not really. I like Wolfenstein 3-D, and I think that this game is like an expansion pack, but for younger children. Anyways, the game places you in the hands of Noah, trying to get all his animals to not be all over the place and not cause chaos. Just like Wolfenstein, you shoot enemies and go through many maze like levels. But because the game is geared more towards kids, alot of things have been changed. For example, the Nazis in Wolfenstein have been changed to animals like goats, ostriches and deer in Noah's Ark. Plus the blood has been taken out (Which really isn't a big deal for me). Anyways, it plays identically to Wolfenstein that I don't really need to say much about it, since so many people have already played it. In conclusion, is this game original? Absolutely not, but if you go into the game with a fresh mind, you might have some fun with this game.","March 26","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I thought it'd be another meme game, but this game can be fun.\n\nAs far as classic-as-hell shooters go, this one manages to stand above what I'd have expected; it's fast paced, straight to the point, pretty fluid, and there are secrets galore, it's all good, albeit maybe too simple fun.  Heck, the first hour of this I played was more enjoyable than the very little I remember of DOOM.  Navigation can be pretty confusing, due to the walls looking pretty much the same (it was '94-ish after all) and the maze-like layout of the levels, but thankfully, there's a convenient map.\n\nEven if it's competent enough, I've been having a lot of issues about the save feature; it does function for the most part, but it works utterly bad because of how OCD I am, like if I make a new save at the beginning of a level, I must either save or load another one to not accidently quicksave over it (there aren't slots dedicated to Quicksaves).  I can't reorder the saves in the game, but instead I'd have to number them in the save folder, AND it's not in the order of (1, 2, 3, 10), but is rearranged by the first numbers (1, 10, 2, 3), it's odd, and deleting some saves messes with all the others (due to Steam Cloud?), and thus I lost a few saves because of this (??!?).\n\nThankfully, the "Christian propaganda", if I could call it that, isn't in your face, it's very tame and take instead the form of optional quizzes for goodies, and read the stickied FAQ, you wouldn't be supporting fraudulent pirates by buying this.\n\nDespite the issues I have with the saving, and even though it's far from being a blast of a game, you wouldn't go too wrong with this one, and if you love Wolfenstein 3D to death, this is an interesting coat of paint.","May 28","true","13.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The rest of this (rather short) review is going to assume you've already seen the AVGN video.\n\nSo yeah, this game is wolfenstein, everybody already knew that, it plays exactly like wolfenstein, the only differences is that there are animals instead of nazis, most of the textures have been replaced and one new powerup asks questions regarding the story of Noah's ark. Nothing really all that new or special. There is slightly different music to the SNES version, due to it being in MIDI format, so it sounds "nicer" than it's SNES couterpart.\n\nOne thing I was suprised about was that the company that made the SNES version (Wisdom Tree) is still actually in operation, the copyright on this game is actually 2014. I suppose some things never truely die.\n\nThe gameplay is fine, if a bit akward for modern gamers. The Wolfenstein engine has not aged that well in terms of control. There is no mouse control, period. You use left and right to look left and right, and press up to shoot. wasd does what it normally does and space is the use key.\n\nBeyond this there's not much else to say. I suppose you could say that this game is actually the first total conversion mod in existence, so if for some reason you happen to be a collector in the modding genre, you can pick up this peice of history for cheap.

With Super 3-D Noah's Ark, you'll find a wealth of artistic treaure. Originally released as "Noah no Daibouken: Kokoro Shimapan" for the Japan-only FM Towns Marty, S3DNA is revolutionary for it's time in it's portrayal (and subsequent deconstruction) of the Catholic faith. Over 5 hand-crafted worlds, you'll experience the highs and lows of this classic character's plight to save not only mankind, but art as well.

It was originally rumoured to have been made due to id Software employees being disgruntled at Nintendo for censoring the SNES Wolfenstein 3D, and handing the source code to Wisdom Tree, but this rumour has turned out to be untrue. Wisdom Tree legally liscensed the engine from id Software, in a boringly normal way. Even though the rumours were nothing more than urban legend, I still was interested in seeing this oddity for myself.\n\nI bought it for curiosity's sake as an AVGN fan, and found it's actually not as bad as I expected. It's just a Wolfenstein 3D mod with some decent levels and a strange premise. I've seen worse. If you can get past the odd aesthetics of the game, then you might as well give it a try, considering that the dev who ported this oddity is the developer for ECWolf, a great source port of Wolfenstein 3D, (which this game happens to run on) as well as a developer for ZDoom. I don't mind throwing a few bucks to support Blzut3, considering his work on ECWolf and ZDoom, both of which are great source ports.\n\nIf you are concerned about the religious theme of the game, don't worry, it's pretty much just windowdressing. I'm an Atheist, and the game doesnt bother me. It's not trying to push an agenda or anything, it's just Wolfenstein 3D where you go around shooting nazi animals. The game was pretty much created to sell FPS games to overprotective parents. I view it as a novelty game, and nothing more than an odd modification of Wolf3D.","June 24, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This was that Game that never made it to that Super Nintendo my grandson got his big break in. What is this, a do-over? Peh!"\n\n"This game is a first-Ape Shooter, from what it says. You go around this boat, and shoot what could possibly be clones of Animal buddies with seed to make them...fall asleep? Bah, That's lame. Back in my day, all you had to do was throw a Barrel at 'em, and they'd stay down!"\n\nGRAPHICS: The Game itself is the same wooden texture, with a picture of ducks, Noah himself (Self-loving jerk), and other things. to make this not as wooden-visualized. Not much to say.\n\nGAMEPLAY: This is what other call a Wolfenstein clone. That is because back then, they, like every other company that used the engine, bought the rights to use it. So if you've played that one, you've unknowingly played Noah. This edition fixed the clunky control a tad for the newer PC standards, so easier control! It actually feels tight.\n\nSOUND: Well, it sounds MUCH better than the SNES version, I'll say that, though it sounds a bit repetitive. You'll hear the same recycled music, which is one, or three songs, but at least the first you hear sound catchy enough. It's not much though.\n\nSTORY: So apparently you are noah, feeding animals to make them sleep, so you can get them off the ark. Ooook, strange, but alright. I heard worse. Noah doesn't actually shoot them, though, he shoots them so hard, they get knocked out.\n\nOVERALL: "Eh, it's alright. Not the greatest DOS-Shooter there is, but it's better than tryin' to play it on a unlicensed catridge!

Later you get something that acts as a ******* machine gun putting innocent animals to sleep whenever they cross you're path. You are mother trucking Noah.

Yes, it does run on the same engine, but this game really shows that engine alone doesn’t make a good game. Super 3D Noah’s Ark does not have nearly the same polish and balance of ID’s games. Enemies have little warning they are there and shooting (the auditory queues are not nearly as prevalent), and the sheer amount of enemies compared to the amount of health and ammo available, especially later in the game, almost makes it feel more like a survival horror, as getting near a single animal can mean death as you desperately scour the level for health and ammo, sometimes to no avail.","February 4","false","8.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Making Super 3D Noah's Ark for the super nintendo entertainment system wasnt bad enough they decided to bring it to modern day PCs through steam. The public reviews are also having a laugh 95% based on 202 reviews! This is when joking about a game goes too far, the same as Bubsy-two fur. People have joked so much that someone who comes round browsing his/her list of recommended games then sees this has 95% they'll actually waster their money on it. Now new people who are looking at this game, listen to me well and listen to me now DONOT BUY THIS SACK OF GOD'S ♥♥♥♥. GOD HIMSELF ♥♥♥♥ ON THE SNES FROM THE HEAVENS AND NOW HE DECIDED TO DO IT AGAIN TO PC IN 2015! GOD HIMSELF WOULDN'T HAVE MERCY ON THIS GAME'S OR THE DEVELOPERS SOULS!\n\nI'll give u a bit of background on this game. Super 3D Noah's Ark was one of many bible games released by wisdom tree in the early 90s. They were primarily released for nes, however those games were later ported for sega genesis. This was the last game made by wisdom tree and it's probably their most shameless one. Their other games were sh*t but this one takes the sh**ting crown. At least their other games weren't a rip off of another game. That's right Super 3D Noah's ark is  a rip off of Wolfenstein 3D. But they have one difference, Wolfenstein 3D was good.\n\nIll now talk about how bad Noah's ark is.  You play as Noah carrying a slingshot and you need to shoot food at animals that are currently in the ark in order for them to suddenly fall asleep straight after and for some weird reason these animals are really angry with Noah because all of them are attacking him.... I couldn't make this up. What did Noah do to these animals to make them all so mad with him. He saved their lives by putting them on the ark. Also, I'm not religious or anything like that but I know for a fact that Noah only put 2 of every animalon the ark so why are there like 100 goats, sheep, ostriches,oxes and probably every other animal on the ark? FOR A RELIGIOUS VIDEO GAME COMPANY THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT RELIGION!\n\nThere are also questions about the bible in the game basically it's multiple choice, it gives you the question and gives you the passage. If u get the question correct u get an extra 5 health and 5 ammo no sorry it isn't called ammo it's called feed. One thing I noticed is that one one of the questions, I noticed it didn't give me a passage it instead said "No hint!" THE PASSAGES WERE HINTS!? DO THE DEVELOPERS OF THE GAME SERIOUSLY THINK THAT I HAVE A BIBLE NXT TO ME WHEN I PLAY MY GAMES?! WHEN I PLAY SKYRIM I DON'T CARRY A BIBLE AROUND AND GIVE EVRY ENEMY IN THE GAME A FUNERAL WHEN IKILL THEM!\n\nThe best way to sum up Super 3D Noah's Ark is one word "Weird" I fail to see why wisdom tree thught that this game would be  a good idea. Also this game wasn't officially released on the snes, it was the only game released for the snes that wasn't licensed by nintendo, so it was out of nintendo's power to  do anything about this game  being released and to have this game's ♥♥♥♥ being spewed onto their console but valve had a chance to do something about it but they chose not to. Instead they allowed it onto greenlight and the public allowed it onto steam. ALL OF THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE!\n\nThis is a weird game with no sense to it at all and I'm still trying to figure outa meaning behind this game and I'm sure religions will find the meaning of life before I find that answer\n\nFinal verdict\nPros\n\n+Barely any glitches\n+Runs at 70fps\n\nCons\n-Weird\n-Uses incorrect grammar (Like I tend to do in my reviews)\n-Noah's eyes move one at a time\n-Brakes on of the bible's passages\n-Expects u to be carrying a bible around everywhere you go\n-Boring\n-Bad map\n-Awful controls\n-Uninteresting idea\n\nFinal verdict: 2/10\n\nSteam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","December 19, 2015","false","1.5"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","2"
