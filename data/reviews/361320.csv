That's all you need to know.\n\nNot helpful? Okay, fine. I played this game a lot back when it came out in 2003. Yes, it's basically a casino management sim. The beauty of it though is that the game never takes itself very seriously. This is the casino game with blackjack and hookers. I'm not even kidding, you can hire 'escorts' for those casino guests that are looking for a little love. You spend most of your time dealing with sabotage from competing casinos in the form of cheats, troublemakers and hitmen. You get your guards to eject them or better yet, get your bouncers to work them over. Best part is, you can get your own cheats, troublemakers and hitmen and cause chaos at the other guys' casinos. Spiking drinks at the bar and watching people throw up and pick fights is always funny.\n\nThe downside? It won't run on Windows 8. Maybe there's a way around this. Also, the game looks bad. It didn't look so hot back in 2003 and it has not aged well no matter what resolution you set it to. You do at least get a choice of most modern resolutions. But the cost of the game is less than your average trip to Starbucks and it is a ton of fun if you don't mind a dated looking management sim.","April 17, 2015","true","2.8"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","79","31","39","12","0"

Also, when I first posted this, I didn't realize the game is actually pretty old and runs well considering its age. Well done!]\n\nI just lost a couple of hours playing this game without realizing it.  It's a good time waster, though I feel like a $2.50 price tag would easily get a lot more sales.\n\nPros:\n\nAfter you muddle through the awkward sort of tutorial and get the hang of things, it's actually really fun!\n\nYour bouncers actually do beat people to death.\n\nI liked competing against other casinos.\n\nWorth the $5 if they would clean up the bugs and add more features.\n\nCons:\n\nA little pricey for what it delivers.\n\nSlow and clunky feeling while learning. Feels frustrating at first.\n\nBuggy when trying to get the bouncers/guards to take action.\n\nEmployee unhappiness is a little overtuned. Their happiness decays a bit too quickly for my tastes and doesn't seem to make any sense. They'll be making twice what the minimum for their position is and still ready to quit.\n\nChanging screen resolution doesn't do anything, so everything looks huge and it gets frustrating because I'm constantly looking for better zoom out capability than what is provided.","April 17, 2015","true","2.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","2"

Fun game but wish there was modern versions of games like this since has the potential to be a pretty fun IP. Maybe Konami should revive the IP since this game feels like an old classic style of game.","April 30, 2015","true","6.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

Hothouse was well known for making very complex games, and this is no exception.  It may look simple on the surface, watching over your one starting casino, but then you realize that there is an entire living city running in the background - and every person in it is being driven by their own motivations.  Advertising, transportation, and expansion all come into play here.  It starts off simple & easy but get more difficult and complex as time goes on - which is precisely the winning formula for a good strategy/simulation game.\n\nMost of all, however, is that the developers have been positive, friendly and wonderfully supportive of this project ever since it arrived here on Steam.  They wasted no time fixing the few remaining bugs and then, for no reason other than to be awesome, they threw in the expansion pack at no extra charge.  And mind you, Hothouse isn't even around anymore.  Roger is basically the antithesis of J.C.Smith over at "Repopulation."\n\nSo if you enjoy a complex strategy game and don't mind dated graphics to get it, you really can't beat this game - especially at it's price.","May 26, 2015","true","9.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This is the best casino tycoon game i ever played. 12 years ago, i was playing the demo version of this game. I wanted to buy this game but i could't find it from anywhere and i promised to pay for this game one thay. Now i paid for it and it deserves every cent of it. If you love tycoon games and interested with gamble and management, this is your game. You can build your dream casino with many various materials such as gamble tables, bars, kitchens, disco, bowling, theatre and cinema halls and hundreds more. You can even even pick custom routes for your shuttles street by street. Competition system and graphics are still fancy.\nYou wont be regret if you play this game.","June 17, 2015","true","12.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

A balanced gameplay with enough challenges to keep you going for a while. Don't expect great graphics, it is afterall a cartoonish management simulation.\n\nBiggest downside that I find it having is that it is not stable at all with windows 7. The game has a habbit of crashing to desktop at random moments and has even given my relatively new rig a blue screen of death. For a game this old to be released on steam you'd expect they would've solved it by now.\n\nUpdate:\n\nWith this new upgrade of "the management" expansion back the game has gotten a lot more stabil.","April 21, 2015","true","54.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

A fault on my end, but luckily I have another computer that's running on Windows 7, so it wasn't much of a big deal. Upon installing and running, the game is not fully functional. The main problem is that it always force closes whenever I try to complete an objective. Another problem is that I can't see the map of the town, which is a big inconvenience if you're trying to do things like plan bus routes, and that my hitman and troublemaker menus won't open, meaning I can't complete certain objectives and advance in the game. I had this game as a CD when I was a kid, and I enjoyed the hell out of it. At the moment, it still needs to be fixed and will hopefully be able to run on Windows 8 in the future. Make no mistake, despite these bugs, the game is still fun. It's better to wait until a patch comes thru addressing these problems. I am going to try to re-install and see if that fixes any of my problems.","April 23, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 16 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","2","16","0","0"
