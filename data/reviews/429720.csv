"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ManeShadow/recommended/429720/","ManeShadow","MarsShadow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ManeShadow/","164 products in account",""There is a way to turn an entity into data..."\n\nBetween games like Undertale, Pony Island, and IMSCARED, the idea of breaking the fourth wall of the game to terrify the player directly is quickly becoming one of my new favorite tricks.\n\nIMSCARED is the full retail version of the original, much smaller game of the same name released back in 2012. If you've heard of it or seen any gameplay videos or Let's Plays, chances are you're already aware of the game's central "gimmick". If you'd prefer to go into the game blind (which I recommend) then don't read any further. IMSCARED is a good game for a very cheap price. Worth the play.\n\nIf you're curious, then read on: IMSCARED's main idea is that the game will mess with your computer itself to deceive, attack, and scare you. Essentially created a horror game acting like a malicious, haunted virus. Right off the bat the game automatically creates a folder on your desktop where it will send you messages, sometimes to aid you, and other times to taunt you. The ways the game requires you to think outside the box and the ways it uses your computer become more creative and more clever as the game goes on. For a gimmick, it's a well implemented gimmick.\n\nIt should be noted that when I say the game's tricks get more clever as you go along, the entire game really is the same way. The first gameplay section of IMSCARED (past the short tutorial) is the original 2012 game in it's entirety with one or two very minor changes. Compared to the rest of the game afterwards, the beginning segment feels amateur, and it's not a great testament to what the game had up it's sleeve. It feels very much like the developer took the original game and has been building and improving on it since 2012, leaving the segment feeling a tad uneventful and slow (not that the segment is bad, mind you, but the rest of the game just feels a lot better).\n\nYou're probably going to either tolerate or hate the graphics. It's VERY low-res and can make finding small object sprites hard. On the flipside, it does help push the idea that "this is a video game that's acting very wrong". Movement can be annoying, as the game has a tendency of having you get stuck on objects or even in narrow corridors, especially when running.\n\nThe game's no Silent Hill 2, but it has some fun, creative scares and incredibly creepy atmospheres, especially when it incorperates the gimmick of a haunted video game. Even the least subtle parts are still better than many cheap indie horror games.\n\nMuch of the gameplay consists of puzzles, which get better as the game goes on and it fully utilizes the central idea to it's potential, even if there's a bit overreliance on keyhunting, usually there's more than just backtracking to keep it interesting.\n\nOverall, for four dollars, IMSCARED is a good game to check out. Maybe it won't for your style if you can't suspend some disbelief at times, but if you can, then I believe you're in for an enjoyable and scary ride.\n\n\n","February 3","true","2.1"," 96 of 110 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","96","110","8","0"

A game that has the player interacting with an entity that communicates with them by creating text files on the player's desktop is intriguing. The visual style, while not entirely original, feels dated, a commonly overlooked way to create unease with the player. The game's price point is also low and suitable for a game with this level of content. However, IMSCARED stumbles in a lot of areas and left me frustrated with it. I'll break down what I didn't like about the game.\n\n1. I said in my introductory paragraph that I found the interaction between the player and the game to be intriguing. While it is, it's also a bit awkwardly implemented. There are several points in the game where you need to be reading a text file while playing the game. During these segments, you can put the game in windowed mode, but the window is incredibly tiny and the controls sometimes glitch out while you're trying to go back and forth between the text file and game.\n\n2. The game "crashes" and closes itself on several occasions. This harkens back to Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem and the original Metal Gear Solid, where the game attempts to fool the player into thinking that the game is actually interacting with something in the real world. I initially didn't mind this, but the game began to abuse it. If you get caught by the monster at certain points in the game, the game will close and you'll be brought back to your desktop. There were points where you're required to solve puzzles with little to no conveyance as the monster chases you around the environment. If you get caught, you're brought back to your desktop, losing your progress up until the start of the puzzle. I actually took breaks from this fairly short game because I was so frustrated with my constant failures. I also imagine my Steam friends were getting annoyed, constantly seeing me start and stop playing the game. If the game maybe brought you back to the menu screen when you died rather than completely closing out, this wouldn't be so much of an issue.\n\n3. Jump scares, jump scares, jump scares. I see a lot of reviews praising this game for being "truly scary", but I see very little criticism of its over-reliance on jump scares. While I'll admit that the game made me feel uneasy at times with its retro atmosphere and creepy ambience, there were way more occasions where something would pop out and make a loud noise at me for a cheap scare. There are points where an overlay will flash on the screen with a loud noise and the game will close, something entirely jumpy and even more forgettable. The worst offender, however, is a puzzle about 3/4 of the way through the game where the player is tasked with finding record players in a maze and destroying them. You're being chased by the monster during this segment, but weird figures will come down from the ceiling and screech at you for absolutely no reason. They add nothing to the experience at all and don't play into the puzzle in any way, just being added as cheap scares to make the situation less scary than it would have been if you were simply being chased.\n\n4. The game is somewhat fragmented. There isn't really a hub location until the very end of the game, and the areas you're going through have little to nothing to do with one another. You go to a supermarket, a train station, a basement area and a hedgemaze throughout the course of the game. These areas aren't really connected to each other until the very end, and even then the game only connects them through a series of doors that teleport you to these areas. Some of the areas even require you to input different things into a text prompt, something that is vital near the end of the game if you didn't get all of the achievements (I'll expand on this later). Overall, you find yourself teleporting from area to area. The game will close, and you'll find yourself in an entirely new location without any explanation as to why. As a result, nothing feels familiar and the game feels stitched together, like a collection of different ideas.\n\n5. Movement is awkard and actually somewhat buggy. It's fairly simple, being mapped to the WASD keys for moving, the Shift key for sprinting, and the Ctrl key for crouching. However, it's easy to get "caught" on objects, requiring you to reposition the camera in order to move again. If you want to try this, you simply need to walk along a wall and rotate the camera towards it. You'll eventually get stuck and won't be able to move unless you rotate the camera away from the wall. This wouldn't be so bad if there were actual segments where you need to get through cramped spaces and you're constantly getting stuck on both sides of the wall. There's also a segment where you're being chased through a hallway, and while I only got caught on a bookshelf once, it still exemplified how buggy the movement is. It's also worth noting that if you crouch next to certain objects, you can clip through them, which looks very awkward and allows you to peer inside some things.\n\n6. Near the end of the game, the player is about to go through the last door when the game prompts them that they need to get all of the achievements in order to proceed. At first I thought this was a trick, but it's serious. Closing the game will bring you back to the start of the game, which has opened up some new doors to previous parts of the game where you can obtain these achievements. When I started this game, it was less than a week old. The achievement list gives absolutely no clues as to how the achievements are obtained and the discussion board was barren of help. This left me stumbling about, trying to figure out how to get the last few achievements so that I could actually finish the game. Some of these achievements are incredibly obscure, requiring you to do things like knock on a wall and set your system clock to certain times in order to get some items. Achievements are meant to entertain completionists, not frustrate people who just want to experience the game.\n\nI truly, dearly wanted to enjoy IMSCARED. It does some really interesting things and has a very low price point. However, the times where I was wowed were undermined by the amount of times I was frustrated or disappointed. In the end, this is just a short indie horror game with lots of jump scares and a somewhat entertaining fourth-wall mechanic. It's not incredibly noteworthy and I can think of other games that do fourth-wall breaking better with less frustrations and more polish.","February 5","false","2.9"," 128 of 189 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","128","189","7","7"

It is still one of the only games to actually scare me. This new version adds about another hour of content, and so many new ideas that it STILL feels so fresh and terrifying after four years. The original and the workshop edition are perfectly blended together to create a flawless beggining to the game, and once the familiar is gone, your are thrown right into the deep end. There are new chase sequences, new story elements, and new interactions the game has with you computer that is just amazing. You will have to interact with files, interact with the Internet, and interact with your clock to progress through the game. Also, the dev is amazing. I had a glitch in my game, posted it on the discussion, and he fixed it in thirty minutes. Awesome dev, awesome game, and an overall amazing experience. 10/10 You did it man, you made the scariest game I have ever played.

I'll admit I was blown away. The low-fi visuals and audio, the fourth-wall breaking, the Yume Nikki vibe. All in all, a well-thought, hand-crafted piece of eeriness. I liked it so much I kept that version for years and gave it a play every now and then, showing it to some of my friends as well.\n\nThen, February 2016 came and on twitter I saw my friend benzoin-gum re-tweeting Ivan's announcement about the Steam release - that was a really nice surprise, and I thought I owed Ivan a beer for the entertaining he's granted me years before, free of charge. Hence I bought it, and that was it, I didn't even want to play it again initially, but shortly after I caved in and gave it a go.\n\nLo and behold, there were a bunch of new areas to explore, new stuff to see and hear. New chapters, and secrets. I didn't know that, it was a very welcomed surprise. Yes, the game still lives to its old expectations and surpasses itself in this expanded version. I'm one achievement short from completion, but I reckon it won't be long due.\n\nFor the price of a pint of beer, I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes Yume Nikki, or had at least one dream in their lifetime where everything was bright yet the sky lied still, and black.\n\nupdate: 100%\n\nThe last chapter was very intensive and frightening.

Even lying in the game itself. I've played it for about 40 Minutes and while there are jump scares the game looks great and the tension builds fear. If you played and liked the Free version then don't hesitate, if you haven't then try the free version.\n\nConclusion\nIt lives up to the name and expands upon the free version and is very cheap, I give the game a 9/10 for being scary, loud and fun.\n\nMy YouTube Video\nSoon!

Thankfully, IMSCARED adjusts itself with this in mind, and drops the shock-seeking act in favor of unique puzzle solving that intertwines what you do inside the game with what you do outside of it. You'll transition from being a victim of IMSCARED's shenanigans to learning how to use them to your advantage, but despite gaining control you'll still feel uncomfortable not knowing what's going to happen next.\n\nThe implementation isn't flawless by any means - the uphill climb to the game's ending may prove more frustrating than frightening for some, and certain sequences may result in death desensitization. In certain places, IMSCARED is a little too particular about what you have to do in order to progress, and there is potentially a great deal of backtracking required to collect everything required to complete the game.\n\nEven so, the feeling of playing a game that's actively plotting against you is done to a T in IMSCARED, and if that's a feeling you'd like to chase - especially if Pony Island/Undertale whet your appetite - then IMSCARED delivers.\n\n(A word of warning, currently Windows 10 users are reporting rampant problems with the game's file-creation mechanic - which is required to progress and ultimately complete the game. Avoid if you're a Win10 user, until/unless that functionality is patched.)","February 7","true","4.5"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","21","27","2","0"

That's what I said after I finished the game.\n\nI played the first version of this game, the one that came out on 2012, and that version was pretty good for what it was, a free game on Gamejolt.\nNow, this new version adds double the content, more rooms, more puzzles, achievements and more.\nThe game itself, compared to the original, plays a lot more with the gimmick of a "haunted pc", adding files to a folder created on the desktop by the game. Does this break inmersion? Not really. A big part of the game is playing around with text files and .ini files, and after editing one of those files, you don't stop feeling scared, because the game makes sure you are afraid even in the safety of your desktop.\nThe graphics are a hit-or-miss. They are very low res, but at least to me, they are really unique. I mean, this game made me afraid of a 32x32 pixel image.\nThe sound design is pretty good. It fits the game perfectly.\nSome of the puzzles, at least for me, seem a little unnecessary.

The game is vastly supperior to the original, and it makes you feel like your entire pc is haunted. It makes the unexpected happen, like opening web browsers and playing youtube videos.

Although the game is very short (3 hours at best if you're looking to find all the secrets) it's filled with nice and never seen before ideas. The whole concept of playing with the game as an entity instead of just playing the role of a character inside of it is amusing and very well executed. Don't expect to find a real "plot" here, because what you'll be doing will just be...playing with the game. Literally. You'll understand more only if you'll try it yourself. Here I can just say that it's truly something unique and worth to try, even if you're not the kind of person who enjoys the so-called "walking simulators". I am not, just to say.\n\nThe only real flaw that I can find in this title considering the fact that has been developed by a single person resides in its graphics: I understand that the pixelated style is intentional, but a 256x144 resolution is really ridicolous. 480p should be considered the minimum for decency in this kind of games, going lower than that just makes everything look worse than it should. Aside of this, I think that IMSCARED is a little gem that delivers an experience that requires thinking without being pretentious or excessively cryptic, and that keeps a substancial coherence with its premises.

IMSCARED has been a long time coming into its current incarnation into a full game, but it lives up to it's 5 dollar price tag just fine, and then some. It's hard to explain how good this game is without spoiling any of the experience, but here goes.\n\nThe horror game genre is undoubtedly gimmicky and saturated like the film one, it's hard to find something that truly suprises a die-hard participant in the genre. IMSCARED is the one of a kind exception. Some may argue over the pixelated art style, the cliche "meta" gameplay, or even just the length of the title. But I disagree, it's these things and how well they're done that make this game truly shine.\n\nWhere others have simply copied and combined aspects of previous works, Ivan (the developer of IMSCARED) has outdone himself to the point where this game simply excels at being, well, horrific. There is a moment in this game to scare everyone and give them the chills, not a single opportunity is wasted to let you know the situation you have gotten yourself into.\n\nIMSCARED doesn't get old, not in the sense that it has replay value, but it is true: once you complete this game in its entirety you will not look at any horror game the same way again. What this title does is excite you while unsettling the hell out of you for the entirety of the experience, from the start to the very end (oh, and I do mean very end, this game while technically short, feels like a lifetime to complete in the very best way possible).\n\nSuffice to say, buy this damn game already.

Many years later, Youtube recommended me a video by Jordan Underneath about it, and that's how I learned that it had been made into a fully fledged game with a bunch more story and plot and of course, scares.

To say much more is to spoil what makes this game unique.\n\nThe relatively spoiler free version of the gameis that you have to escape from the nightmare you've been put in. The graphics are great at selling the otherworldly atmosphere and the sound design is also super creepy. It uses both jump scares and atmosphere versus relying solely on jump scares, making it a winner in my book. My only real complaint is that sometimes the puzzles get to be too obtuse. Most of them are good brain teasers, but some require seriously out of the box thinking. A bit too much for my tastes.\n\nStill, the atmosphere and creativity at play here is great and worth checking out. Like I said, this is a game that is beter left unspoiled, which is why I've been so vague.

The steam version includes the free version plus another 2.5 times that content. So essentially 3.5x the free game. It is a defining game of the indie horror genre, and breaks the fourth wall in a way that I have never seen any other game do. These fourth-wall mechanics are incorporated into the gameplay, making it an even more unique experience. I believe that IMSCARED is the #1 indie horror game out there, and an absolute must-play for anyone interested in the genre.\n\nThe only con of this game, to me, is the labrynth portion that occurs ~1/4 of the way through the game. It was honestly a huge stalling point and not very fun to me at all, making me frustrated to the point of almost quitting. After getting over this though, the rest of the game was amazing. I had expected it to be the original game plus more thrown together content to make it 'long enough' to justify the (incredibly low) price, but that's not what this game is at all. Every part of it- save the labrynth- is a wonderful, unique terrifying experience.\n9.5/10","February 6","true","6.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

However, there are some parts that really frustrated me. For example: There's a part where  you're in a maze trying to destroy 3 phonographs while you're being chashed by "HER". The only way to find the phonographs is if you listen carefully with headphones while moving around.  I kept dying alot due to confusement, but of course I successfully did it anyways.

There are different environments that you traipse through, each with a different atmosphere, but nothing felt intuitive or exciting. Sometimes there's a hidden key you haven't found, and sometimes you have to go check out files that the game is creating on your desktop. Sometimes you even have to close and restart the game yourself to continue. The fact that the game never communicates what you have to do to advance can sometimes create situations in which you're not sure if you should be looking around harder because you missed something, or if you should write a five page essay and submit it to the game. The fourth wall bits are interesting but poorly implemented for a cohesive horror experience.\n\nThe story is weak and vague, the graphics have a nice style but make text illegible, and the jumpscares were mostly unnecessary. Some parts of the game rely on sound within a 3D soundscape, and sound seems to originate in one position but does not change relative to your movement. Certain actions like climbing a ladder or printing tickets have a gratingly loud volume for no reason.\n\nMany achievements were very arbitrary, and ended up being necessary to finish the game. Oh, and if you want to go back to get the achievements, have fun figuring out the ridiculous hallway hub. 2 doors go to 2 areas, one door with a pickup is needed to access a password screen to get to 2 other areas. It's as dumb as it sounds.\n\nIMGLAD that I didn't pay more than $4, which still seems too steep for the overall quality of this "game,"  or waste more than 2 hours getting achievements to see the loud, lame ending.

I'm not kidding, it really is a simple game with kb/m controls. WSAD movements, ctrl kneeling, E to interact, and shift to sprint. Nothing more.\n\nIt's hard to believe that none of my friends here own this $4 game. It's absolutely wonderful. Easily paralyzing, too. It basically makes a folder in your computer's Documents to attack you many many many times throughout the game.\n\nThis game is a real experience.","April 8","true","1.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

pixelated nightmare or maybe its just imscared the freeware version is called pixelated but the steam version is just imscared in my library\n\nbecause this is one of those games the obligatory twisty twist heres a short review; dont buy it. you can avert your gaze now and play the freeware version instead of this which i havent actually played but its probably this but shorter and freer so just play that if you want some ♥♥♥♥in twists. going back to the actual review imscared is a walking simulator horror game where you solve all of your problems by walking and picking ♥♥♥♥ up while the game tries to scare you except its not scary and pulls some pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t near the end of the game. maybe im horror desensitized now considering i beat amnesia and that wasnt scary but whatever write your own review ♥♥♥♥ juggler. im sure there are better and scarier walking simulators out there for free or not.\n\nnow that everyone who who wants to keep their imscared virginity gone i can safely talk about the only reason this game has any attention whatsoever which is the twist. the game does this meta ♥♥♥♥ which is summed up as what if game was alive and because game is life the game interacts with your computer in a meta way which sounds interesting. the game pushes this to the limit of intentionally crashing and sometimes playing a sound effect while youre out of game once it does and adding/editing text files in an imscared folder. truly my fear has reached a zenith unknown by sentient beings. this feature is seriously what has propelled this game into any sort of spotlight and its poorly utilized every time it gets dragged up from the depths of meta hell. like for real there are two things this game uses the meta ♥♥♥♥ for: text files and a single semi jumpscare thing and the text files are all puzzles that suck ♥♥♥♥. so does the jumpscare but whatever. the game also tries to tell its story or some ♥♥♥♥ via those text files in cryptic and mostly uninteresting fluff paragraphs to go along with the stupid puzzles. i guess thats the extent of the meta ♥♥♥♥ as well as the game crashing when you die. if you are buying this game thinking it is some sort of superb fourth wall adventure you are wrong. this game is bad. i seriously wish i could write more about the meta ♥♥♥♥ but i cant because its just so not there. all of the puzzles with meta are seriously just you ♥♥♥♥ing with text files and if that sounds fun ♥♥♥♥ you.\n\nthe gameplay is walking simulator. i am so glad walking simulator has become a legitimate genre on steam. the entire concept of walking simulator is ridiculous and yet omnipresent among ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games. this is one of those games. the entire game is just walking around and away from enemies and pressing e to pick stuff up or interact with ♥♥♥♥ because the rest of the game is not scary horror. its basically a worse version of amnesia in like everything. ive already said it before but every single puzzle is just finding the right thing to press e on or the sequence of things to press e on. thats it. that and the meta ♥♥♥♥ which i said before. more importantly though the game pulls some serious asspull near the end where it actually requires you to have all achievements to progress while also not giving you any hints on what those achievements are. most of these achievements are self explanatory but there are definitely a few that could be easily missed and i missed three on the first playthrough plus theres one thats almost impossible without a guide which i used. i can only assume its trying to push the meta adventure envelope here too except instead of fostering a community of people who explore the game like yume nikki it makes everyone go look up a walkthrough on youtube to avoid potentially hours of backtracking through ♥♥♥♥ youve already been through to find a stupid ♥♥♥ achivement for this stupid ♥♥♥ game. unlike yume nikki this game has nothing interesting to find or explore so i dont know what the dev was doing with that. and yeah you do have to backtrack for all of them all of them are based on pressing e on things or looking at ♥♥♥♥.\n\nanyway the horror. the horror is horrible. life is horrible and so is this game. the horror seems to be based on the sort of hidden agreement you might get a jumpscare sometimes and that incredibly low visibility plus being chased equals horror. like im not even joking about how little you can see there is an impenetrable wall of fog forever surrounding the player almost all of the time. it varies in distance but still it seems to exist only so the player gets super spooked when the monster is five feet in front of them before they see it. the game also enjoys being ♥♥♥♥ing loud as ♥♥♥♥ for most jumpscares and other ♥♥♥♥ which makes me more annoyed than scared because this game has caused me slight physical pain instead of horror. its really just not scary and none of the gimmicky ♥♥♥♥ it does makes it scary.\n\nthe graphics in particular help absolutely nothing about this game. yeah its a pixelated nightmare i know but was the title not changed. running from a ♥♥♥♥in pixel face like come on son. the games environments look decent enough but none of them were scary which is a problem when this game is betting every single farm on horror. the game gets much worse in the second half when the face thing chasing you suddenly and inexplicably transforms into a girl thing chasing you which they actually manage to make more hot than scary im not even joking. this is a mostly featureless pixelated white thing. if you ever do play this game to the second part pretend to make johnny bravo advances on the ghost girl so that the game crashes when you touch her and you dont have to play anymore. for real though dont play this game. for real again this game isnt scary looking ever.\n\nthen we get to the sound. you know i think that this game actually did the ambience sort of well. it had a sort of vintage low quality freaky record player approach that worked pretty good and was different from the generic whisper/cave sound/whatever that ive found in like every other horror game. the sound effects though. the sound effects were alright except for the ones that ♥♥♥♥ing kill your ears holy ♥♥♥♥ why. sometimes the game decides it is in the best interests of all parties involved to emit a piercing ear destroying sound wave for reasons i assume are loud = scary. its laughably bad especially when you finally get to the ♥♥♥♥in end of the game and the game pulls this ♥♥♥♥ repeatedly to the point where i was actually laughing every time it occurred because of how ridiculous it is. like holy ♥♥♥♥ kill me now. anyway im done with the review im not talking about the plot because thats on life support so ♥♥♥♥ you heres a conclusion.\n\nfor a game that probably totes how innovative it is for breaking the fourth wall the pixel ♥♥♥ graphics and boring walking simulator gameplay say otherwise. it takes no leaps in game design or anything else that would make it truly remarkable. its not even fun as a non horror game. its not even fun as a horror game. its just not fun. it seems every gameplay mechanic was built to accentuate the horror instead of being good in its own right like what amnesia tried to do with its puzzles. i wont say amnesia went further than tried though. thus enjoyment of the game entirely depends on how much of a ♥♥♥♥♥ you are and how much you enjoy being scared. if you are a ♥♥♥♥♥ who enjoys being scared just play amnesia anyway.","February 6","false","3.0"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

The atmosphere is menacing, the scares are terrifying, the music is creepy and fitting, and the ending is unforgettable.\n\nThe antagonist messes with your head psychologically, then emotionally. You will feel very uncomfortable as you are forced to make heartless and horrible decisions, but this leads to one of the most bittersweet moments in gaming I have ever experienced.\n\nSome of the puzzles were very clever and fun, forcing you to think outside of the box in order to solve them in ways no other game has thought of. However, they aren't perfect. A couple puzzles were very tedious: the hedgemaze and the grammophone puzzles specifically. Without spoiling anything, these were a pain to get through and were the only sections that are actually detrimental to full experience.\n\nThe game could use some more graphics options. Forcing the player to play in a lower resolution is archaic and creates a delay when having to alt+tab to the folder. There are also no FOV options or checkbox to turn off headbob. These two options would prevent a lot of simulation sickness for those that can get a little light-headed from first person view video games.\n\nThat all being said, any fan of horror should definitely check this out. It is beatable in 2-3 hours, and fully worth the price of $4.","February 16","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That had me at time sweating bullets and my heart racing.\n\nIf you think this game is not worth the price, just head over to game jolt or indie-db and download the 2012 version. Its about two hours or so worth of playtime and  i think you will be  sold on the unique game that is ImScared: A Pixelated Nightmare and find its worth  the 3.99$\n\nIf you want to  get the most out of your game play:  Go in with as little as knowledge about the game as possible and leave your expectations at  the door.

It gets in your head and messes with you while giving you a great story to boot.  This version adds a lot to the length of the game  i've put four hours into it so far and still haven't finished it.","February 23","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The atmosphere is menacing, the scares are terrifying, the music is creepy and fitting, and the ending is unforgettable.\n\nThe antagonist messes with your head psychologically, then emotionally. You will feel very uncomfortable as you are forced to make heartless and horrible decisions, but this leads to one of the most bittersweet moments in gaming I have ever experienced.\n\nSome of the puzzles were very clever and fun, forcing you to think outside of the box in order to solve them in ways no other game has thought of. However, they aren't perfect. A couple puzzles were very tedious: the hedgemaze and the grammophone puzzles specifically. Without spoiling anything, these were a pain to get through and were the only sections that are actually detrimental to full experience.\n\nThe game could use some more graphics options. Forcing the player to play in a lower resolution is archaic and creates a delay when having to alt+tab to the folder. There are also no FOV options or checkbox to turn off headbob. These two options would prevent a lot of simulation sickness for those that can get a little light-headed from first person view video games.\n\nThat all being said, any fan of horror should definitely check this out. It is beatable in 2-3 hours, and fully worth the price of $4.","February 16","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sort wot is like Hack n' Slash or The Magic Circle.\n\nAs that particular type of game is super rare, when I found out that this game is also that, I jumped on it.\n\nAs per usual with metagames, the less said about it the better.\n\nAs for the horror bits from someone who *really* doesn't care about horror (and as such is woefully unqualified to tell anyone if horror is good or not), it was pretty good. At least a few of the jumpscares actually got me and the general mood of it is fairly spoopy. That wasn't my core engagement, though. I just wanted to know the next way the game would screw with me.\n\nTake this as a recommendation purely for the metagame.

Don't buy this if you're not good at puzzles, horror, or computers in general. Basically, this game is for, like, 16+. Maybe 17+. I guess basically don't buy this if you're an idiot. Or if you can't follow instructions. Or if you had a hard time with the gamejolt version. It doesn't matter which.\nAbout the game, it's basically what would happen if you combined the 1st one, 2nd one, and extended content to finish the story. This game will throw you for a loop, and if you're not smart enough to figure it out, you won't know what to do. Basically, follow it's instructions to a T, and think outside the box. Then live in that box and wonder what you've been doing with your life. Then stop wondering and continue the game. Repeat. Something I found interesting was that you learn that Sample Text from the first game and Stop mousing over these. from the second game are If you keep doing that... about prepare to have a bad time through the game. Also, there are 2 endings that you choose at Boiler text the game. The one I chose, which meant I I know these are just some funny fake spoilers, but please. Don't ruin it for yourself., let me You feel your sans crawling down your ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) because you moused over these to read spoilers. . It was pretty cool to see the Luckily, all you got were these., because of how long you took actually reading these reviews instead of getting the game. Anyways, don't mouse over the spoilers if you haven't beaten the game. Otherwise, you wouldn't get what I typed until insert time length here through the game. Hope you enjoy the game!","June 4","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
