The same music track in each level can get a bit grating.","January 19","true","0.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

I don't think there are too many games that are actually based around the holiday of Halloween. It's a standard platformer that gives you plenty of health so it's a little on the easy side. The pixel art is great! It gets me in the Halloween spirit with all the different horror themed stages and monsters. It's pretty short, but for $2.99 it's well worth the price tag. Plus, the developer intends to add another level or two.\n\nGet this game if you want:\n-A simple, short, and easy platformer with good pixel art and a quaint Halloween theme.\n\nDon't get it if you're looking for:\n-A really difficult and/or long platformer or a game more oriented around actual "scary atmosphere" rather than just a simple Halloween theme.","January 19","true","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's pretty easy once you get the hang of it but it is really fun to play. Great music, great level design, and cool colorful graphics.

This game is new, but done like a retro platformer. It's really fun, and the Halloween spooky setting is awesome. If you're into old retro platformers like this, you'll most likely enjoy this, BUT my short game time is representative of the games length. My 0.7 game time is after I played through the game multiple times with a couple game overs.\n\nEven though this is still classed as being in "Early Access" the developer has said this release is finished as he originally intended, but there will be more updates to the game, fixing things, adding new levels and extra content.\n\nAs I, and everyone, pretty much said, this game is very short. Even though I very much enjoyed my time with it, I almost lean towards not recommending it because of it's length... But if you're into this genre, for the price of £1.99 and the promise of extra content coming later, I think you'd be right to try Halloween Forever out.\n\n\nEDIT: Thinking about it, £1.99 is a little much for such a short short game. Maybe wait for a sale if you don't want to spend your spare couple pounds (dollars, euros, whatever) on this :P","January 21","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I liked this retro 8 bit adventure and I think it's worth playing especially if your a fan of 2d platformers! I also made a letsplay on this as I was interested in this game just by looking at the screen shots and maaan, I was not dissapointed, the only thing I found weird was W being the jump button and thats because I prefere it to be the space bar.. but other than that its a really good game and I had fun playing it, great job! :)\n\nMy video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgjaRqA9854&feature=share","February 10","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I find most of the game super simple apart from having to start again completely from the start. I wouldnt mind so much if there was something more to the game like finding secret areas or extra lives or continues somehow. Controls do the job but nothing that stands out really. Really like the concept the pumpkin head dude and the characters. Hopefully this stuff can be addressed. In the future before full release. and also check out a mobile game called Venture Kid it is well made and has a nice balance to the design to hold your interest. In its current state i cant really recommend this game.","February 29","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
