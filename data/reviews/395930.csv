If anything, it may be a little too similar to the previous entry with few gameplay changes, although if you enjoyed Hurricane Season, this one will certainly appeal to you.\n\nThe game is your standard genre fair; each level gives you a set of objectives in the area of collecting a number of items and creating food dishes. You're only given so much time and money to purchase livestock and tend to your land, so figuring out a strategy on what to buy and sell while keeping critters out of the barnyard and picking up produce before it disappears is the gist of the gameplay. Things can get hectic, especially if you're trying for gold, but can be rather laid back if you're not worried about challenging yourself.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=506817570\nAs you complete levels, you'll earn stars (in-game currency) that can be used to upgrade your farm equipment which will then churn out more product or give more storage space. You can also level up your trusty companions to better help fend off pesky intruders, and even buy tokens to use on the slot machine, making an overabundance of currency actually useful.  Completing in-game achievements also awards slot machine tokens which can be used to win more tokens, stars, and power-ups useable in the game levels. The power-ups aren’t required, but are beneficial if you’re aiming for gold trophies.\n\nAll of the artwork has a cartoony aesthetic to it that compliments the casual game play elements quite well. This is clearly the same artist as the previous game; all the characters look the same save for wearing pirate-ey apparel, but it’s pleasant on the eyes and fits the overall humor of the game.\n\nOnce again, the absence of Steam Achievements is a sore spot.  At least the in-game achievements award tokens which are much more valuable now since they are no longer awarded from gold trophies.   But full Steam integration is a must for casual games, as it adds so much value to the overall package.  Trading cards are indeed nice, but not enough.\n\nThat said, Heave Ho is another great casual title, especially if you're looking for lighter fair to relax with in-between more serious gaming sessions. Despite my misgivings with the lack of Steam integration, it’s still a solid time management game that will appeal to those who enjoy the genre.\n\nBottom Line: Recommended for those looking for a relaxing casual title with lots of polish and character.\n\nNote - This game was provided by the publisher with the request to write an informative review. No other consideration, compensation or instruction was received.","August 26, 2015","true","7.7"," 83 of 94 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","83","94","3","4"

The game bears the Buka trademark cute childrens story book graphics. As is characteristic of nearly all games from this publisher the game is family friendly and well suited for younger children, but will appeal to casual game fans of all ages.\n\nThe graphics are full HD and are both cute and well animated. The artstyle is colourful and pleasing to look at.  The game has been given a pirate themed make-over this time with all the animals wearing pirate themed attire or sporting pirate themed tattoo's.\n\nThe sound is contextual with pleasant samples. Music is sequenced sound loops in a pseudo country style arangement which is pleasing to listen to. There appears to be a single in-game track repeated during game play stages which gets a bit repetitive. The repetition is broken to an extent by different tracks for the menu and pre-game instructions.\n\nThe player is tasked with purchasing chickens, collecting eggs, processing the eggs to make powder eggs, processing the powder eggs to make pasta and also accumulating funds. Storage facilities can be upgraded as can manufacturing facilities. Dogs can be hired to help capture ferrets and bears which can be sold at the market. Cats can be hired to collect goods and place them in storage.  As storage becomes full goods need to be transported to the market for sale.  There are additional facilities and more stages to complete than in earlier games in the series.\n\nThe style of play is arcade action with puzzle solving and resource management aspects. There are rewards for completing level completion criteria within certain time constraints.\n\nThe game is fun to play and it can be quite challenging completing stages within the required time.\n\nThe game size is small which should be a relief to those with limited storage capacity on their compter or laptop.\n\nTo summarise, a fun family friendly game with really cute graphics and good re-play value for those who like casual games.\n\n7.9 / 10","August 27, 2015","true","18.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Flash Style Critters animate nicely.  Good Sound Effects that have been in the other games.  Nothing to write home about music.   6/10\n\nGameplay\n\nThis plays exactly like any other Farm Frenzy Title.  The formula is the same.  You are tasked with growing a Farm from the ground up and exporting your goods accordingly.   Except this time you're trapped on an island.  Alawar Entertainment needs to step it up and add something new to the series to get it going again.  The same old routine just doesn’t hack it anymore for this guy.  However it is still a fun little title to pass your time.  And if pirates are your thing and you love casual games this is the title for you.  6/10","August 26, 2015","true","6.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

So You will get more Stars.\nYou need stars to upgrade building or unlock new items.\nThere are predators that are trying to ruin the farm or your farm animals.\nThe game is relaxing.\nLeaving in a middle of a level will be automatically saved. So once you are going to play again, you will start off with the exact same timer and results where you have left the last time.\nYou do not really have to use a booster to complete a level. It just makes it easier.\nThere are Awards and once you complete them you get some Coins.\nYou can spend coins to play in a lottery.\nEverytime if something new comes in play, They will introduce/instruct it. and they will have a slow pace for boosting the dififculty again.\n\n\nOther things.\nThis reminds me from one of many games on most gaming websites. (Like Flash games)\nYou can Re-do the levels that you have completed before to get some Stars again.\nThey are always so happy, having big smiles... It scares me..\n\nAn easy way to get money is from the Spaghetti machine. So Egg -> Egg machine -> Egg flour -> Spaghetti machine -> Sell it -> 100 Gold profit.  But why not Pasta? Well First you have to wait long, because it requires 3 steps to make it. Then u also need ketchup, which also will take time.. So if you sell those, you will only get 180 gold profit. Yes you get more.. But it takes longer. So in the long run, selling those spaghetti things will earn better.\n\nThey call the Slot machine "Roulette Table".. There is a huge difference in between those.\n\nI Give this a 7/10","December 18, 2015","true","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When a storm hits suddenly, her boat capsizes and she finds herself stranded on a small island occupied by pirate animals…. What is going on here?\n\nAs the friendly animals come to Scarlett’s rescue (well, that is what she thought) she quickly finds out that they are in need of a cracker of a farmer!\n\nFarm Frenzy: Heave Ho is the sequel to Farm Frenzy: Hurricane Season, and if you enjoyed the previous one you will definitely have a good time playing this game.\n\nEssentially, you will have to complete all tasks per level within a specific time to achieve the golden chest. Upon your success you will receive a token which you can use in the slot machine to get well-needed booster which you will be able to use on the next level. Of course you will also gather money which will can be used to purchase upgrades.\n\nThe pirate theme does give this game a plus and the cartoon style graphics are always fun. One thing I noticed is the levels are considerably more challenging than the previous title. In terms of the audio, not much change; I would personally prefer something a little bit exotic, Flamenco perhaps?\n\nIn-game achievements but no Steam achievements, however you will still be getting trading cards.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Fun and challenging\n-	Nice cartoon graphics\n-	Value for money\n-	Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n-	No Steam achievements\n-	Slightly repetitive\n\nA fun management/strategy game for all ages.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/395930/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","So much for a relaxing vacation!\n\nPoor Scarlett has been dragged into more farming mayhem in this new addition to the Farm Frenzy series. After having a bit of misfortune during her trip, she ends up on an island where the local animals need her help with farming. It's a game filled with talking animals, making steaks and so much more.\n\nIt's a standard time management game, each level you're given a task and a certain amount of time to complete it. While you can take as long as you like, if you want gold or silver status you'll need to be quick about your work. You have different animals to tend to and different machines to re-purpose their goods. There is also a slot machine to gain boosters as well.\n\nTwo downsides to the game, though. It's a lot like the previous installment Hurricane season. While this is good because it means solid game play and great art, it also means the same music and a lot of the same machines and tasks. This can make things a bit repetitive so I would suggest playing it in bursts when you're in the mood to relax. The game also seems to lack Steam achievements but it does have Steam cards.\n\nIf you enjoy the series and want more farm antics then this good for you, or if you're new to the series and are looking for a relaxing casual game. It offers both a challenge and a good time","August 26, 2015","true","5.3"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"
