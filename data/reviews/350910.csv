That's not saying anything at all.\nOk.\nStreets of Fury EX is one of the best beatemups on Steam.\nEh? Eh?!\nWhat? That's still not saying anything? Jeeze.\n\nBeatemups are a tough genre to figure out. When you break it down enough, it's just walking up to people and punching them in the face. However, there's much more to it than that. This is a genre that demands perfect mechanics, solid controls, and the right balance of challenge, depth, and entertainment. Most developers don't even get the mechanics right, let alone everything else.\n\nStreets of Fury EX gets practically everything right. On first glance it looks ridiculous, but that's part of its charm. Not everyone is going to be nostalgic of games starring digitized characters, but I don't know. I kinda hope they'll make a come-back. It also helps that the cast of characters are uh...mostly normal. It reminds me of Dong Dong Never Die. That was a game filled with random people that can somehow throw fireballs, soar through the air, and cause earthquakes when they stomp the ground.\n\nThere are 15+ playable heroes in SoFEX. Each fighter has a set of regular moves, special attacks, and a handful of supers. Combining these techniques to create combos is extremely enjoyable. Even during the beatemup genre's peak (the 90s) most combos were just mashing the attack button to perform automatic moves. With this game, if it keeps the enemy in the air, it counts. This game uses a lot of ideas present in other fighters, such as ground bounces, launchers, and OTG shenanigans. Basically, this means that you have a lot of tools to play around with. While unnecessary, it's also nice that each character has a distinct personality. Most of them have multiple taunts as well as unique "death" animations.\n\nWhile it would probably be enough to create a bunch of dullard enemies to style on, SoFEX relies on making every enemy unique. There are a ton of re-used sprites (as per genre-standards), but they all have different strategies. Let's look at the Jesse Pinkman knock-offs. These jerks use guns. The orange Jay Cees don't attack, but will shoot you out of the air. Red? He taunts and then fires, which has the added affect of making him partially invulnerable (unless guard-broken). As for green, he just fires with no warning, but has no invincibility. No Jessy can be approached in the same manner. This ideal extends to the entirety of the enemy roster.\n\nThe two campaigns do a fine job of exploring the possible enemy combinations. Eventually you'll grasp what works, and try to maximize your damage in the few openings you can create. It's the perfect showcase for the real depth that can be found in a beatemup. In order to beat someone down, you have to work for it. This aspect is further driven into the player's head in the Survival mode. In each wave, the player must contend with increasing odds. The enemies are randomized, which can result in an numerous combinations. It's up to the player to use the myriad of tools at their disposal to separate foes from the pack and give them a quick yet thorough crushing. The bad-guys will not shy away from making the player suffer. In later waves, a single screw-up can lead to the player getting juggled for half their health.\n\nFor another kind of challenge, the...uh..challenge mode offers numerous battles. It's almost like a puzzle game. You have to figure out the right character, what enemies to focus on, and which moves to perform. There are a few "kick everyone's ♥♥♥" missions, but most of the time you're going to try different combinations and ideas until you find the one that really works. It's a satisfying addition. An amusing bonus that shouldn't be ignored is the campaign edit. Various parameters can be changed, from enemy aggressiveness & numbers to gravity to how fast everyone moves. This can result in tons of hilarity, as well as even more ways to play through the game.\n\nMore important than anything else: This is a beatemup that just feels right. The mechanics are properly handled. There is enough satisfaction when punching an enemy, as well as appropriate warning when an enemy is going to attack. This is accomplished through animations and flashing effects. If you have a watchful eye and keep your ears open, you'll always have an idea of what's going on, even when 10+ enemies are on-screen. Every hit is on-point, nothing feels cheap or leaves you thinking "how'd he hit me?! He was way over there!" Within minutes of playing you get a feel for how everything works, and can start working on the finer details as well as developing your own amazing combos.\n\nThis game is missing online-play...which hurts bad. The last release didn't have it either but damn, I hope it happens eventually. Couch co-op is always an option at least. In any case, this game will last quite awhile. I couldn't tell you where Streets of Fury EX stands among the classics, but it is one of the finest beatemups released in the 21st century.\n\nI hope that's saying something.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","July 1, 2015","true","19.0"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","43","48","3","1"

So you can imagine my delight on discovering that this game wasn't going to die as an unknown cult classic and that they were doing an updated version for PC.\n\nIMHO, this is the best "Go Straight" beat-em-up after Streets of Rage Remake, but that has the advantage of already having a template, music, sprites, etc to work from. Streets of Fury, however, has a far better combo system! Seriously, the amount of variety and personalisation of the combos is a joy. It's also taken a leaf or two from the Saturn/XBLA classic Guardian Heroes, which is probably the other member of the "Best Scrolling Beat-em-ups Trilogy".\n\nYeah, the graphics can look a bit dodgy a first glance - but look at the animation! The more you look at and play with the characters, the work more you see has gone into making some excellent game mechanics. The music's great, there's loads of interesting and diverse characters, 4-player co-op/versus, unlockables, a couple of fun modes, etc and from what I hear, there's more content in the pipeline... This won't convert people who hate the genre, but there's definitely something quite pure and essentially videogamey about a game like this that a lot of people will enjoy - definitely recommended.","July 12, 2015","true","28.5"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","0"

A really good parody!\n\nSeriously, on my first playthrough I couldn't stop smiling or laughing even when i tried. If you played this kind of games in the 90s you'll know what I'm talking about when you play this one :P\n\nAnyway, the fighting mechanics are solid; in fact they are better than most old beat-em-ups. There are a lot of  playable/unlockable characters with unique personalities and fighting styles. And, for the most part, their animations are very smooth. The gameplay can be a bit repetitive, but very polished and challenging.\n\nI wish they included more female characters and female enemy npcs. In fact, I wish they had a bigger variety of unique enemies as a whole, especially when it comes to the bosses. Still, by combining different enemy types on each level the game will push you to keep coming up with new strategies.\n\nThe one thing that failed to impress me is the level design. Levels are kind repetitive and flat. In the old-school fighting games you were fighting on moving trains, inside buildings, inside elevators, on beaches, in gardens, etc. There were bystanders, destructible barrels and boxes, power-ups and weapons that you could pick up. Not here unfortunately. Most of the time in Streets of Fury you are fighting either in the streets, parking garages, or the subway platform, but the textures and colors are so similar for each location that it feels like you are on the same stage over and over.\n\nDespite the shortcomings, Streets of Fury EX is a great game. Well worth the $10 price. I really want a sequel.

That's Streets of Fury EX in a nutshell.  It reminds me of the sort of game a bunch of my buddies in high school and I might have made, had digital cameras and cheap chromakey software been widely available then.  But underneath the somewhat amateurish look is a surprisingly deep and fun side-scrolling beat 'em up, with tight controls and a robust combo system.  Stringing together multi-hit beatdowns is a snap, and each of the many unlockable characters has a full arsenal of combat moves, including chargable super attacks.  Up to four players can join in local co-op, and survival and challenge modes are also available.  Sadly, there's no online play, nor is there a training mode to practice your combos.\n\nIf the game seems familiar, that's because it originally made its debut in 2007 on the Xbox Indie Games service, and was a finalist in the the 2008 Dream Build Play competition.  The 360 version was fun, but clearly constrained by limitations of the hardware and the platform.  The smooth animation of the video-captured sprites meant that only a few actors were used, and their footage spread across multiple characters with extremely similar movesets.  In a genre that's already heavy on repitition, that's not a good thing.  But for the remaster, the developers added a slew of new, distinct brawlers, many of whom parody popular fighting game icons (check out the martial artist with his Ryu-style Shin Shoryuken, or the scarf-wearing send-up of Street Fighter 3's Q).  Guard Crush Games even apparently got one of their dads to play the end boss!  The fighting system has also been revised, with some control changes and a "stamina" meter added, which can be used for powerful special moves or to block enemy attacks.\n\nOverall, this is definitely worth a look even if you played the original eight years ago (yikes, has it really been that long?).","June 29, 2015","true","2.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","1"

Choose from a list of regular looking people wearing rugged clothing and fight your way to the Big Boss. That’s really the story, I mean it is a beat-em up title after all!\n\nHigh Points\n\nBeat them down – Streets of Fury EX excels at the classic go straight formula. You can select from a wide variety of characters and proceed down the street beating the living crap out of anyone in your way. There is a direction based combo system in place that allows you to air juggle opponents, guard crush, or pull off powerful special abilities.\n\nMortal Kombat with a hint of Narc – Visually it hits the nostalgia factor with the live action combat of a Mortal Kombat title. The backgrounds remind me a bit of the old Narc arcade title. The game has that pasted together look that most live-action based Arcade games usually have. It works well for a game that is clearly intended for the coin-op generation.\n\nCooperative play – Playing with a friend is the absolute way to play Streets of Fury EX. The combat is less cheap with two people watching each other’s backs and stringing together combo after combo. I was only able to play this with two players, but I can only imagine the insanity of playing with four others!\n\nNitpicks\n\nNo Online Play – Local only cooperative play in a world of the internet. Hope you have four controllers and a few friends that want to come over and play a ragtag arcade game.\n\nLack of enemy variety – By the time you’ve reached the third act of the story, you’ve fought everyone in the game. They will then distinguish themselves by walking around with disco lighting all over their bodies or adding a different animation to their attacks. It starts to become repetitive for what is mostly a game you can plow through in about forty-five minutes.\n\nLow Points\n\nQueued up moves – There isn’t a lot of room for reaction to certain moves in the game. Unlike beat-em ups in the Arcades of the 90’s, there is a lack of fluidity when attempting to fight multiple enemies. Let’s use Streets of Rage 2 as example. I can easily fight a character in front of me, spin around and attack the next one and move in-between the foreground and background to avoid attacks.\n\nStreets of Fury EX queues up moves and leaves you vulnerable to attacks. Unlike most games that allow you to spin around and immediately attack, the only type of defense in these instances is to block and wait for a counter-attack. It leads to a lot of unfair ♥♥♥ beatings while playing solo, which means this game was truly intended for cooperative audiences.\n\nTerrible character choices - There are a lot of brawlers to play as, but a large amount of them are dreadful. Despite the awful choices in clothing some of them wear, there are just too many that leave themselves open to attacks. Not a lot of attention was paid to making these fighters functional combatants. At least sixty percent of these fighters are straight up doo-doo on a cheese sandwich and that’s the opposite of delicious.\n\nConclusion\n\nStreets of Fury EX is an Arcade game from the 90’s in the year 2015. It’s only going to appeal to people with that hint of nostalgia in their hearts. It’s not anywhere near a masterpiece but it does provide us with a fair amount of coop beat-em up action. I’ll be honest… you probably won’t want to shell full price out for this. It’s a bit rough around the edges in terms of beat-em ups, and fails to live up to the genre with a barebones combat scheme.","June 25, 2015","true","3.3"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","14","23","2","2"

Battles are in 2D, but take place on multiple "planes" that you can jump between at will, much like Guardian Heroes. Combat is heavily based on a wide variety of devastating "Fury" moves like upheaving bursts of fire, powerful area-of-effect clearing blasts, and excessive punch combos.\n\nThe most notable point is that despite the gameplay, the game's graphics and art direction are hilarious: it's a hilarious parody of games like Pit Fighter and early Mortal Kombat, but seemingly much more self-aware and in on the joke, which works well with the game's atmosphere. It works extremely well as a "parody" of the genre, but doesn't skimp on the gameplay as a result, as the battles are a bit more involved than the average beat-em-up, what with the wide variety of moves.\n\nThe only real issue is the lack of online co-op.

I was pretty amped to discover that they were planning on doing a PC version of this, so I've been patiently waiting...\n\nStreets of Fury is a throwback to late 80's - early 90's arcade style beat-em ups done in the style of games like old-skool Mortal Kombat using digitized sprites. Streets of Fury sports a very competent and deep combo system that is simple and pick-up-and-playable for beginners, while more experienced players can string together ridiculously long combos that look like something out of a high level MvC2 or Skullgirls match...\n\nThe EX version takes everything from the original and simply expands & improves on it.\n\n+ Larger roster of playable characters.\n+ New enemy types.

In the original, you were required to use the triggers to dash, and switch lanes...\n\n+ The stamina meter, is a simple addition to the game but changes the way you'll need to approach this game if you're coming from the original version. Basically, whenever you use a special attack it requires some stamina and if you run out then you won't be able to do any special attacks until it fills up a bit... R.I.P gun-cancel infinite spam :(\nWhere things get complicated is that your stamina meter also doubles as your guard/armor meter so blocking attacks reduces your stamina and losing all your stamina causes you to guard break. It should be noted that both players and enemies use stamina.\n\n\nAnd while I do like this game, there are some glaring omissions, and just some general stuff I don't like with this version.\n\nStuff missing:- Character movelists from the original. Seriously why was this not included???\n- Combo tutorial videos. I found these very useful, and having these videos in the original gave players an easy way to see what the general playstyle of the characters were, as well as a basis for building combos.\n\nGeneral annoyances:- 2015, and still no online play for both the co-op and versus :(\n- The button prompts in this game do not reflect your current control scheme and prompt simply assume that you're playing this game with an Xbox 360 pad using the default key binds.\n- Characters are locked behind a level gate again, sigh... The variety of characters, and mastery of the characters already give you enough incentive to replay this game IMO, so this is just pointless grinding...\n- This is just a personal nitpick, but I really did not like the inclusion of the enemy that swears all the time. It was something that really stuck out like a sore thumb for me, and IMO doesn't gel with the silly, playful nature of this game. Fortunately they included a language-filter option for that guy lol.\n\n\nOverall Rating:- If you're looking for an old-skool arcade brawler with some fighting game sensibilities then I recommend it on account that you're perfectly okay with playing this solo & local co-op/versus.","June 27, 2015","true","23.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

You may also get a lot of mileage out of this game if you enjoy the self imposed challenge of a 1 credit clear. The cast of characters is diverse and their strengths and weaknesses are not very balanced, which isn't a negative for the genre.

You have to figure out how to approach some enemies, and they all have different abilities, so you can't just keep rushing in and trying to start your standard combo.\n\nCombos are fun to pull off, and fairly satisfying.\n\nThe visual style is unique and ridiculous (as you can see from the screenshots and video, it's normal-looking people mo-capped), perfectly fitting for what it is. Because it's so blatantly ridiculous, I think it's funny.\n\nThe story is also ridiculous just like every other side-scrolling beat-em-up. Don't worry about it.\n\nMusic and sound, also great and perfectly fitting for the thing. I think the hit sounds having a bit more oomph would make combos feel a bit more satisfying, but it's alright as it is now.\n\nI was hoping to see some bboys because the French are known for bboying, but I didn't see anything like that.
