You put me on the front page, here is a real review.\n\nLet me start this honestly. I am totally biased. If My Heart Had Wings is the first Visual Novel I ever played, and I love it with all of my little heart. Also in case you didn't notice I've played this game for more than 900 hours, and only 20 of those hours were idle. I've run through each route in this game at least 15 times, and I can actually speak really crappy Japanese because of this game. In addition, I've spent more money on this game for the badges, emoticons, cards, extra cards and backgrounds.\nSo yeah, I am biased.\n\nIf you chose to continue thanks, and here's the review;\n\nThe good parts of this game are extremely good, and the bad parts of this game are extremely bad.\nSo here is the good.\n\n1. The characters are well fleshed out, being both fully voice acted and having logical lives and choices. Sure each of them are anime tropes, but the tropes are presented so well that they work here. Ageha is the generic tomboy, Kotori is trapped in a wheel chair, Amane is the innocent genius, the twin's are polar opposites of eachother that rarely agree. Ageha's suggestive dialogue makes you smile, and Kotori's fears are understandable. Even Amane's childlike innocence is presented in conjunction with her hopes for the future, and living up to what it means to be an adult.\n\n2. Next is the art, it's not the crazy excess.....of certain areas.....of the Sakura series, or the strange realism of more "American" anime. Here the character's are mostly normal. This is a personal preference, but I certainly appreciate it.\n\n3. The routes are also well done. Kotori's, of course, is the main route and does have the most story, and in the words of most reviewers "it got da feels". But, personally, Kotori is not my favorite route. I enjoy Ageha's more, as a matter of fact Ageha's route was the first I completed. Her personality develops as much as Kotori's on the route and becomes as complex as Kotori's. The same happens with Amane's route. The twins' routes are probably the least interesting, but still work well.\n\nThere is more good like the soundtrack, the dialogue, and the story itself but it's time to move onto the bad stuff.\n\n1. Moenovel, and censoring. These are probably the most obvious problems. The game was originally published in Japan, and was translated by Moenovel. They did a pretty crappy job of it. Not only are their many horrible typos, and brutal censorship, they also directly detract from the story. One moment in particular always breaks the immersion. At one point Ageha is explaing that a women can control any man with her big, bouncy, round....eyes. Now, we all know that "eyes" is definetely not the right word. This comment which could have gotten a laugh without censorship really crushes me. I have played this game with the fan-created restoration patch, but it is agony to install.\n\nOverall, I think this game gains a solid 8/10 for most people and a 9.5/10 for me, mostly due to nostalgia. Definetely worth the purchase at full price, and a steal for less than $5.\n\nThanks for reading, this is my first legitimate review so please feel free tell me if there is something I should mention, or something I could improve on.\n\nAnother edit; Just hit 500 hours. Currently very proud of myself\n\nOne more edit; Thanks for voting this review to the top of the store page, I appreciate it alot.\n\nEven more edits; 200 voters?! Thanks so much everyone!\n\nI need to stop editing this; Thanks to steam user;  The Enlightenment  for pointing out that there is a partially complete (and free!) app for android and iOS of If My Heart Had Wings. Moenovel is updating it slowly, and the app is about 25% of the story.\n\nThis must take forever to read; 300 people! Wow. Thanks again guys.\n\nJust keep adding, just keep adding; Thanks for getting this to 400 people!\n\nMore edits; Thanks for getting this to 500 people and still having a 99% rating, it's very appreciated.\n\nI think the edits are longer than the review now; 600 people! Woohoo! Thanks everyone!\n\nThe amount of edits is getting ridiculous; 700!? Thanks again everyone!\n\nA new edit; I didn't even now that there were 800 people in the whole world.\n\nMás edit; 900 people, still 99% Thanks so much!\n\nEdit #1000; 1,000 people!

Okay, here we go.\n\n\n"If My Heart Had Wings" is a beautiful and touching Visual Novel rivaled only by the likes of Katawa Shoujo. It is eroge and bishoujo; it's not a porn game, but there are adult themes and elements. The soundtrack is SUPERB. The plot is intriguing and every character is incredibly fleshed out. No two paths are anything close to being alike. Speaking of paths, there are multiple ways this VN can play out, as is typical of VN. All of them are deep and emotionally satisfying. I literally had to take a day off work the day I got this game the first time because I couldn't tear myself away from the story. The only VN I've ever loved more than this one is Katawa Shoujo, and I keep mentioning it because there are so many parallels that can be drawn from this VN to that one.\n\n\nIn the story.... JUST KIDDING!! There are no spoilers in this review!!\n\n\nTL;DR\n\n\nIt will make your cold dead heart feel alive again.

If you plan to add me, please make your profile public as I like to see who I am dealing with.\n\nOkay, spoiler alert: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!\nOh God, where to start? This has made me so FREAKING MAD.\nNow disregard the 0 hours I have on this, I have about 24 hours in the patched uncensored Japanese version.\nIt uses the same translation as the steam version and the adult scenes are fan translated.\n\nNow the "company" called Moenovel has made a "translation" of this game, or it should be.\nThe translation is outright terrible! I don't know what incompetent idiots they hired, but they sure as hell aren't translators.\nAbout a good 20 hours into the game, it simply gets really really bad, they're mixing up names.\n\nA few examples are:\n1) At some point they're having dinner and they translate "Hai-yo", which means "(yo) sure", but translated it as "Mornin'" instead.\n\n2) "Amane plus knife equals dangerous... You take care of her, Aoi!" And instead of Aoi, she mentioned Kana.\n\n3) Masatsugu: "Ou- Ouch! Ah! Ageha!" which should be "Oh, over there! Heeeeey! Agehaaaa!"\n\n4) (This is seriously the next line) Ma-bou is Masatsugu's nickname "Huh? Geez, you're such a baby! And so is Kumoi."\nwhich again should be "Oh hey, if it isn't Ma-bou! And Akari is here too." (Akari is the first name of Kumoi.)\n\n5) And this isn't the last time they misinterpret "ita ita" as "Ouch!", such is the case here: "Ummm... Ah! Ouch!" which again should be "Ummm... Ah! Over there!"\n\n6) They also can't tell remarks apart from questions, such as translating "uaa, honto da!" as "Wow, really?" instead of "Wow, it really is!".\n\n7) Again mixing up names: "Habane-san wa?" as "And Aoi?" instead "Habane is?" or "Kotori is?", since they always mention her by her first name for some reason.\n\n8) Again a simply idiotic mistranslation here "Are te...?" as "Arrrrgh" instead of "Isn't that...?".\n\n9) Did I also mention these people can't speak English? "Did you forget about that those legs of yours?"\n\n10) "Do you have a twin?" instead of "Where are the twinsisters?" After that our protagonist talks about ramen,\nbut since he doesn't have a voice and I don't have the Japanese text here I am not sure what it said, but he completely fails  to mention anything about the twins here in English.\n\nSo I mentioned 10 points in a game timespan of about 30 minutes! BUT THAT'S NOT FREAKING ALL!\nThere is much more! I guess they somewhat made the beginning a bit less bad,\nsince that only consists of mistranslations and typos.\nAfter the 22 hour mark they just plainly give up and put whatever crap they can come up with there.\nI suppose they didn't expect anybody to read this for more than 20 hours anyway.\n\nIs this what the visual novel scene has come to?\nTranslations made by incompetent idiots that do a worse job than google translate?\nApparently yes, if you scroll up you can see that this game has a "very positive" rating, VERY FREAKING POSITIVE!\nEither the players of this are very forgiving and hope the next VN translation is going to be better or steam just hates quality.\n\nNow enough about the translation, for the game itself it PAINS me to not being able to recommend this.\nIt's such a lovely novel, the characters are very cute and likeable, has a good story that keeps you interested and the art is great!\nI really love this novel, but that's exactly why I can't let this pass. The company has to pay for this pathetic excuse for a translation.\nSo if you want to support the VN, buy the Japanese version instead, but not this one.\n\nAnd as you might have seen, this one has been majorly censored, anything "adult" is censored out.\nThey even censored the kissing scenes! CENSORED! KISSING! That's ridiculous!\nThere is a patch to uncensor the steam version, but it's very buggy. Which is the reason I decided to download the Japanese version instead.\n\nSo yeah, if you want to support a localization company, support Sekai Project or Manga Gamer instead.","March 9, 2015","false","2.2"," 290 of 345 people (84%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","84","290","345","28","20"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NinjaMac/recommended/326480/","NinjaMac","Mac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NinjaMac/","291 products in account","If My Heart Had Wings would of been an excellent Visual Novel for both beginners and long time fans if it was not so devastated by MoeNovels attempts to "localize" the game, tons of sections are incorrectly translated and then displayed in ways that make no sense in the context they are used. The game is littered with typos and bugs, this VN could of been fine as an all ages version but not only is the sexual content cut but anything resembling an "adult" theme is cut, including slightly innapropriate jokes.\nMy playthrough of all routes was done with the Restoration patch, using this disables steam achievements, restores the missing sexual content (and other removed scenes) and lightly fixes some translation discrepencies. The sole reason I bought the game on Steam was to support more Visual nvoels in the west but I, however will not be supporting any more MoeNovel published visual novels in the future if they keep up this pattern of butchering what was once a great expierence. This has ruined the original developers vision by misrepresenting it with this so called "Localization".\n\nOther than that the only problems I had with the game was that it is not very good for replayability and a lot of routes are locked until you have completed others, this isn't uncommon for Visual Novels but since IMHHW focuses a lot on the Glider, every route is extremely similiar other than the few dates and bonding moments on routes.\nOnce the characters actually start dating the game goes a little down hill on a few routes, namely Ageha's and Amanes as it becomes more focused on the glider. However Kotori, Asa and Yoru all have a bit more time spent on the relationship side of things so are more enjoyable.\n\nTo summarize, I would be lying if I said I did not enjoy my time with If my Heart had wings but I felt like it could of been much better without the huge localization issues, as such I feel I could only recommend this to people with little knowledge of visual novels or the japanese language and that's hardly much of a recommendation. Time would of been better spent finishing another novel. 4/10 you dun ♥♥♥♥ed it up\n\nEdit: Check the comments, I edited some misinformation on my part :)","January 5, 2015","false","55.2"," 167 of 198 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","167","198","5","7"

If My Heart Had Wings is a romance title centering around a high school glider club known as the “Soaring Club.” It is a touching story about loss, love, and passion which is an enjoyable read from start to finish. There are 5 routes in total and all of them had happy moments and depressing moments. It’s hard not to get invested in a character emotionally when they have so much detail put into them.\n\nIf My Heart Had Wings had several explicit sex scenes upon its original release in Japan. However, all of these scenes have been cut wholesale from the game and additional nude scenes have been heavily edited in the Western version. Therefore I will not be talking about the adult version.\n\nThe storyAoi Minase returns with shattered dreams to his hometown of Kazegaura. There, atop a hill lined with windmills, he encounters a wheelchair-bound girl, Kotori Habane, and a beautiful, white glider soaring through the sky. Together, they decide to revive their school’s Soaring Club in order to ride the “Morning Glory”, a cloud known to appear once in a blue moon on the wind that blows across Kazegaura.\n\nCharacters The characters has a diverse and well-rounded cast. There is Ageha, the childhood best friend character who is transitioning from tom boy into a popular girl; Amane, an eccentric genius who has repeatedly failed her senior year in order to remain in the Soaring Club; Asa, the cute, excitable freshman; and Yoru, Asa’s twin sister, seemingly polar opposite; and Kotori the main girl of the story, Kotori, is by far the most interesting character. She is your typical tsundere but have a physical disability,of not being able to use her legs and much of the story focuses on her dealing with her disability of overcoming it and while dealing with the psychological effect of her being a teenage girl not being able to walk on her own.\n\nVisual and audio elementsI generally enjoyed the overall art and visual elements of the game, the background art is really beautiful with vibrant colors being used and the environment is absolutely stunning. Character designs are top-notch too with beautiful CG’s.\nThe audio elements i really loved it has a full Japanese audio for all of the girls, and side characters combined with a well fitting soundtrack sets the mood and feel like it belongs in the situation and the environment.\n\nThe consOverall i feel that there is not many flaws i can find in this visual novel other than it gives way too much information about gilders that turn some point of the story from interesting to boring and some “typo” plus bad translation.\n\nIn conclusionI would definitely recommend this great title from MOE novel, it’s a title not to be missed as this is something that will be a deep, engaging experience.\n\nClick here for full review![azusantiara.wordpress.com]","September 24, 2015","true","129.3"," 113 of 124 people (91%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","91","113","124","13","5"

I'll explain why later.\n\nThis is a visual novel whereby you, Aoi, an expert bike racer injures his knee and returns to his hometown to continue his schooling. There he learns about the Soaring Club and the glider, and wishes to go to the skies to visit a rare cloud formation known locally as the Morning Glory, which is a real phenomenon also (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Glory_cloud).\n\nWhilst getting involved with the Soaring club, he meets a wheelchair-bound Kotori, his childhood female friend Ageha, the eternally repeating (but brilliant) student running the Club Amane, and  identical twins the childish Asa and genius Yoru. You'll also learn the history as to why the club fell on hard times due to an accident in its past.\n\nOh, and there's a pet duck wearing a top hat, and he's called Hat.\n\nAs with visual novels, if you are interested in a character, just follow the options, pick the right girl for you, and don't change. You'll end up on their route all the way to the end. The prologue is common to all routes, and the first route you need to do is Kotori, since it helps to unlock the Asa and Yoru routes. There are no full nudity scenes, nor sex, but you'll read about that later. Time to play is as follows:\n\nPrologue (common route) – 7 hours\nKotori – 15 hours\nAgeha – 5 hours\nAmane – 3 hours\nAsa – 3 hours\nYoru – 3 hours\nBad end – 1 hour (just trying to find it!)\n\nI played the game to 100% completion and got all achievements, so the figure above is the approximate time needed to get them.\n\nNot sure why Kotori took so long, I may have left the game running by accident for a while. You can cheat a little by saving the game at the main choices (of which there are about five) in separate slots, and select a different character, and follow on from there, which is why subsequent playthroughs are quicker, since you can choose to skip all read text to get to the next choice, and then eventually see the new scenes. Controls are basic; hence the low score, but visual novels don't exactly require dexterous fingers and 6000 DPI mice.\n\nVoice acting is there for all characters and most secondary characters too, aside from the protagonist, who is silent, only having text for him. The voices are great, though it can get tiring to listen to them, you can easily continue clicking the text and the next voice will play for the next paragraph. Music (if you buy it in the DLC) is also peaceful, comical and exciting when the mood calls for it, pleasant listening for a 29 track soundtrack. There are two songs which are sung in Japanese, with instrumental versions included too.\n\nArt is beautiful all throughout, from the sprites which are high quality even on my 1920x1080 screen to the backgrounds, with many desktop wallpaper-worthy images to see. There are even some movies showing the flight of the glider, windmills, and characters in the intro. You won't be disappointed.\n\nThe story is the catch though; you're intrigued by the characters and the concept of flying in a glider. Technical specs and terminology are mentioned on occasion, and it even helped alleviate me when it comes to flying, since any aircraft can glide provided there's enough lift and the wings are level. The routes are quite satisfying to play through.\n\nWithout spoilers, Kotori's route delves into her disability and getting to help her fly in the glider. Ageha route is the childhood friend learning to love him instead of seeing him as just that. Amane's route talks about the main mystery in the story, what happened to the previous Soaring Club members, and also her lack of common sense in most social situations. Asa focuses on her childishness and how she sees herself in the world. Yoru's is similar, her route detailing how her intelligence can be used to help others.\n\nSpoilers follow in a moment. The only thing I really disliked with regards to the story was Yoru's route, the problem for me was that there was no 'Yoru route', instead going down the trap of a double-date where both twins are the girlfriends of the protagonist at the same time. This really put a dampener on the entire story for me, especially since you have to make a distinct choice to properly reject Yoru instead of getting to know her early on like the main three girls, or to choose both of them.\n\nOther issues now; sadly, there are a large number of grammar and spelling errors. I expected at least one, but not this many. At points even character names are mixed up so you don't know who they are talking about, 'Quack' is sometimes translated as 'Kuaa', you get the picture. Quality varies from route to route, so it is possible that translators split the jobs up, leaving the less experienced ones to do a route, resulting in these errors. It is quite unfortunate, since it is very jarring to see this during a visual novel.\n\nCensorship was another problem, for some people at least.\n\nI chose not to apply the patch to restore the missing CGs (and yes, nude sex scenes too) with the text corrections as well for two reasons. First is that I wanted to read a story, not read a story and then skip the sex stuff for no reason. I feel it doesn't improve the story whatsoever, and from what I have read, there are a lot of scenes especially in Ageha's route. The writing in those scenes (based off other VNs) is cringe worthy, and I personally do not enjoy seeing images like that. Second reason is when you apply the patch, you lose chance to gain achievements since it messes with the games coding in Steam's eyes.\n\nSome text was changed too to comply with censorship, though it doesn't make much sense, since it is only words! Things like 'she has great big eyes', when the Japanese voice mentions the word for breasts (something you sadly learn after watching lots of anime). One scene (no great spoiler here), where Amane is watching Titanic is actually about her watching porn, though I still found the censored text funny.\n\nFor me, the overall routes in terms of personal quality are ranked as follows: Amane > Kotori > Asa > Yoru > Ageha. The first two have a lot of drama in them, and the ladies really seem to change by the end for the better, and you get quite attached to them. The twins are fairly equal, against coming to terms with their own problems. Ageha to honest annoyed me, and never really seemed to be serious, though that will be up to you to read and decide. Even Yoru's route ranks higher than that for me. I have heard that the restoration patch helps improve Ageha's route since a lot was cut, but I'm not going to review that version.\n\nDespite the text error and censorship problems, this is well worth a purchase. The art is gorgeous, music great, voices funny, story intriguing and leaves you wanting to read the next scene, and before you know it, the sun's gone down.\n\nI could apply the patch now and see all the missed content, but seeing I'll need to play the game over again, it makes me a little sick, so I've had my fill of gliders for a long while to come…\n\n(edit: grammar)","September 15, 2015","true","37.3"," 57 of 66 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","57","66","4","1"

The main storyline is about Aoi and the heroine trying to resurrect the Soaring Club to fulfil a childhood dream that they had: to fly on a glider.\n\nI already played the VN before when it comes out, English Patched & the SNOW PRESENT DLC which just came out on July this year. The story itself is actually good and the romance is done well on all heroines. Each characters has their own distinctive traits but there is one that is a bit tryhard (not gonna spoil it). A certain heroine route's romace is kinda forced but other than that the story is a solid 8.7/10 this VN actually motivates me to pick my current professional career in real life. The soundtrack nailed it completely for this novel but there are times when the loop are out of place which makes it weird at sometimes.\n\nAs for technical stuff, this game rendered on 1280x720 which can be upscaled up to 4k if you have the setup. The 3D portion of the game is done well on some part but on others is just straight plain horrible. Don't let the horrid 3D shoo you away from enjoying this VN though because the story is where it's at.\n\nIf you have finished the VN and can read Japanese, I recommend you to play the FLIGHT DIARY and SNOW PRESENT DLCs because it extends the story further and you get the best girl extra route too (Kanako best girl btw).\nI also recommend using the Fan Patch for extra stuff tho because, you know, "Extra' ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","November 24, 2014","true","7.4"," 80 of 109 people (73%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","73","80","109","7","11"

There, atop a hill lined with windmills, he encounters a wheelchair-bound girl, Kotori Habane, and a beautiful, white glider soaring through the sky. Together, they decide to revive the school’s defunct Soaring Club in order to ride the “Morning Glory”, a phantom cloud carried on the wind that blows across Kazegaura.\nThis is a tale of youth.\nA tale of boys and girls who loved the sky.”\n\n\nThis game comes from the perspective of Aoi Minase, who has just moved back to his hometown of Kazegaura after being gone for six years, you meet Kotori Habane, a girl bound by a wheelchair but has a love for the sky, you both then notice a glider flying through the sky above Windmill Hill, and the story takes off from there.\nAfter your run-in with Kotori, you also meet child-hood friends Ageha and Tatsuya, as well as other supporting characters such as Ma-bou (Short for Masatsugu Tasaky), and other members of the Student Council. When you come to your new home you find that it’s a dorm full of… girls? Seems Aoi’s mother half tricked him into being a dorm-mother (A housekeeper of sorts) to a girl’s dorm, which is also coincidentally home to Kotori, who tends to keep to herself, and avoids contact with others if she can.\nEventually, you end up running into the “Super Repeat Student” Amane in a cluttered garage on the school grounds, where you find is also home to the glider you saw the day you met Kotomi on Windmill Hill, become friends, come together, and share the goal of once again seeing the glider fly freely above the clouds, to the dismay of Mr Tobioka, a teacher who seems to want nothing more than to see the Soaring Club permanently disbanded and the glider erased.\nSoon, you, Kotori, Ageha, and the “Legendary Super Repeat Student” Amane, rebuild the Soaring Club and aim to reach the morning glory, a cloud of extreme rarity and beauty. Each character’s route, while built from the same story, have approaches of varying differences to how the story progresses, there are technically six in total, though one is technically considered the Bad End (Confirmed as the Bad End by steam achievements).\nThe story as a whole is masterfully crafted; each route rarely feels like it has out-of-place story (The only oddities exist in the Yoru Route, which feels like an Add-on to Asa’s route anyways). While choices are few and far between, it doesn’t really effect the storytelling and it shouldn’t, this Visual Novel was not meant to have dozens of choices per route, it’s simple and clean as a story should be. There are moments in the game that take place from someone else’s perspective while at times this is in third person, there isn’t a clear first person either at those times, which really in a unique way puts them in a spotlight, which gives you an idea what’s going on through people’s heads, and even gives important insight to the story (In Amane’s route its almost more important that the main story itself). Many forms of media already do this quite often but it’s a nice change to see in a VN and gives it a better Anime/Manga feel for those brief moments. For many reasons like these, I feel as though Amane’s route is the definitive to the story.\nThere are places in the novel that have been censored for western audiences, such as erotic scenes, adult jokes, and the like, however none of them impact the story too much, however should you feel frisky you can download the English restoration patch, which also has all the other gallery images and features. There are many PG-13 jokes of pretty adult humor, and each time it’s worth a laugh.\n\nMusic and Art\nProfessionals have standards. And MoeNovel set them high, met them, and then surpassed them.\nThe Music has different kinds of feelings from Happy, excited, to somber and calm. The music helps set the mood to the already great voice acting, and the visuals are top quality. Each sprite is done many times over for different faces, poses, and reactions with professional touches making them look pristine, even adding special comic like scenes with pictured depicting an action or event in the story which adds to the imagination, who can’t forget a duck in a top hat running out into the halls with a girl’s underwear?\n\nReplayability and Completion\nThere are six endings, adding to around thirty hours game-play if read at a steady pace, Steam achievements (though they can all be completed by simply doing each route once),  and of course, anything steam related like the new live stream feature, Cards, Collectible wallpapers and Emotes, and more. For 100% completion of the game, you get an alternate title screen, as well as the completed gallery which you unlock as you play, containing each unique art, and CG scenes. As well as the soundtrack. Save-states are a major help, and unlike other visual novels, don’t seem to bug out and ignore previous completion, or even future completion of a route, which makes continuing to a new story right away from the first act even easier.\n\nThough I have not played them, and may warrant reviews on their own, there exists side stories to this one as separate games which have even more unlocks, which are also making their way to the screenshot section of the community hub.\n\nVerdict - 10/10\n\nPositives:\nInspiring, Masterfully Crafted Story\nMemorable Characters.\nGreat Soundtrack\nAmazing Visuals, CG, and Art.\nExcellent length and more than enough content for the cost.\nSteam Support\nFan-patch for the uncensored versions for adult audiences\nGallery with collected Art, CG, and Music.\n\nNegatives:\nNo Kanako or Hotaru Arc. (Please add one, MoeNovel ;-;)\nFew translation errors, however they don’t impact the dialogue enough to make them off target and don’t hurt the overall appeal\n18+ images are making their way onto steam’s community hub\n(Unconfirmed, but complaints about visual bugs and crashing, I have not encountered any, but adding a side note)\n\nFinal Words and Personal Opinion\nThis Visual Novel is not perfect, none are, but this is as close as you can get. This is one of the few visual novels that shouldn’t not only get an Anime adaptation like Clannad, but it deserves one that does it justice. Finishing this review hours after note taking and putting points together, I still have tears in my eyes when I look back. They aren’t tears of joy or sadness, but both. A story that isn’t only emotionally engaging enough to make someone like me, who hasn’t cried in three years aside from one moment in Clannad, cry out of both joy for having the pleasure of reading a masterpiece, and also of sadness that it has to come to a close, is worthy of my first ever perfect score of 10/10. Everything fit together perfectly as if it was meant to raise every bar set by any others. The comedy when present is gold almost every moment. The characters each had their own story to tell, each with their own joy and sadness, and were memorable as they were meaningful to the story. I want a Hotaru arc so bad, she’s just too cute, she’s like the little sister I wish I had. This is the first visual novel to make me genuinely cry and feel for the characters, it sent chills down my spine that I still feel hours later, I just can’t do this visual novel justice no matter how hard I try. With that, I give it a PEFECT TEN.\n\n~Regards\nSolomore.\n\n","December 29, 2014","true","27.4"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","33","37","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dandk/recommended/326480/","dandk","Dan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dandk/","1556 products in account","A lengthy slice-of-life visual novel with great polish and execution, combining an aspiring surreal plot with traditional romantic comedy and deep characters, If My Heart Had Wings delivers lighthearted entertainment tugging at your feelings for several dozen hours and is as good an alternative as any to a traditional book or even a shorter anime.\n\nThe plot revolves around a male protagonist in a high-school setting, having just returned to his hometown (for reasons that shall be kept spoiler-free) and studying while working a part time job in a girls' dormitory. This rather cliché opening quickly evolves to allow for a major super-plot while introducing several subplots (and subsubplots) within the various branching high-school romance options.\n\nGameplayThe software follows the traditional controls of regular high quality VNs, allowing for not only auto-play, message logs and quick saves and loads, but actual scene skipping logs (note: all logs are deleted when loading a save), intelligent skip which can be customized to stop at branches and at new scenes, full customization for resolutions, character-specific volume control, mouse shortcuts by not only the wheel but also right-click and swipe movements and finally the default option to have characters carry on speech past text events if you scroll too fast and the next audio file hasn't been cued. As icing on the cake, the game even includes adorable audio effects for (quick-)saving, (quick-)loading and exiting. Once character-specific branches are unlocked after a full ending, the trigger is transferred directly to all existing saved games, so as long as you remember to save at all dialogue choices, this makes it easy to go back and unlock remaining endings.\n\nStoryThe primary structure of every visual novel, the first noticeable aspect of the story is the sheer length of it. With a prologue spanning ~10 hours (which can compete with the full length of many VNs) and two separate intro movies, five fully individual endings spanning 3-10 hours each, the game is prepared to keep you going for at least 30-40 hours in total, depending on your thirst. Thanks to the intelligent skipping and branching system as well as the uniqueness of every route, I dare say that you haven't finished the story until you have done it all.\n\nAs for the actual content: It's praise on top of praise. While the story might start out slow in the eyes of some, the characters are naturally and thoroughly introduced in the style of the lengthy novel it is. The first several hours are used to get the protagonist at home in his new dormitory and school, meeting the diverse cast of support and main characters casually as they go about in their everyday lives, giving us glimpses of their general personal traits and their relations to each other, and already in this early stage introduce quirky scenes and minor plots that serve no majestic purpose, but are simply there to make the reader sympathize and become familiar with the characters before any real plot kicks in. Nothing feels rushed, and one might compare this to the first episodes of a TV or anime series where everything is still warming up and settling in.\n\nOnce the familiarity is established, we slowly delve into the characters' discovery of and expanding dreams of gliding in the sky - the main, superior theme of the game. However, this theme is constantly explored as an analogy for the main characters' own complicated backgrounds, essentially serving as a catalyst for their adolescent development. The prologue follows the characters' projected worries, hopes and dreams in this matter, giving us a deeper understanding of all of them during everyday life of an entire school year (with the summer vacation as the major plot driver as this is when they have the most free time). During this time, the few decision branches that will determine the 'ending' are also selected. Essentially, the 'prologue' serves as the first half of the full storyline, while the 'endings' serve as the second half.\n\nOne of the five 'endings' (omitting the bad ending) are then selected based on the prologue choices to determine events during the second year, which accounts for the second half of the story. The noticeable result here is that these are not traditional cliché endings where a few sudden choices suddenly makes the woman fall head-over-heels in love with you without any rationale whatsoever. Instead, the seemingly inconsequential choices you were faced with in the prologue trigger a whole avalanche of coincidental outcomes that just happen to favour the person you chose to direct your feelings towards (and in turn slowly direct that person's feelings towards the protagonist).\nThe story shapes itself to focus on that person and blurring out the other characters' roles. That is to say, the other characters simply have their roles rewritten in order to allow the selected person to become the deuteragonist. The supporting characters closest to the chosen person will have their backgrounds opened up as well. In this way, the plot remains pure and reasonable, and all major events happen in mostly the same ways with very few exceptions, but we are treated with completely different scenes and learn of vastly different details related to that character and surrounding characters in particular. This is why every ending is equally breathtaking (okay, some are still subjectively better than others) and provides more information about the characters as a whole, which only encourages you to go through them all. And just to drive the point home, the scenes are completely unique in the sense that not a single line of text is recycled between endings (IOW: five distinct second halves).\n\nEndings cont. and translation\nI've moved the rest of this section to the comments since I reached some character limit for reviews. Please read it there.\n\nGraphicsThe artwork and background CGs are top-tier as far as VNs go, with dozens of aesthetically pleasing locations drawn to detail and interacting smoothly with the storyline to the extent that you could be forgiven for assuming they were screencaps from actual anime. Larger pictures use zoom effects to perceive 3D, while the climactic weather and cloud scenes are breathtaking examples of art only secondary to actual photography. Characters are drawn in high quality manga style with the usual repertoire of traditional facial expressions, facing side to side, different nuances of surprise, happiness and sadness, determination and fooling around, making them look just right in just about every possible situation of the game. To further enhance this, there exists more than a dozen partly-animated unique chibi scenes for when the characters are engaging in some interactive activity, adding to the liveliness and inherent fun of the scenes.\nHowever, the animated 3D models of the moving gliders are slightly edgy compared to the otherwise soft strokes.\n\nMedia From the few but highly efficient emotional original soundtracks hitting the atmosphere just right on cue with the scripted scenarios, to the catchy and award-baiting opening and closing themes that will stick with you forever, the music is as polished as you'd expect from a superior VN. The cutscenes to accompany the opening and ending include traditional VN-style still images, but coupled with great animations of the characters and their glider, making them come truly alive.\n\nProsConsHeartwarming storyline with feelsPeriodically broken translationAt least 30-40 hours of entertainmentSlow-pacedDeep, real and immersive charactersPolished music, animation and cutscenesChibi artwork!\nGameplay: N/A\nStory: 9/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nMedia: 9/10\n\nOverall: 9/10","November 24, 2015","true","67.0"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","35","41","0","4"

Oh, and if you check my library, Sakura Spirit is there for...uh, reasons.\nSo, according to what this game taught me, you play as some kid with no idea how to into girls. He was riding his bike once, then he fell off and hurt his knee like an absolute ♥♥♥♥in' mongoloid. For some reason, he immediately decides that he should go back to some town that he used to live in, and go to some top-tier engineering class. The one reason this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, not including the obnoxious as ♥♥♥♥ school bell noise, is that he didn't learn any decent Engineer tactics and decides that the single greatest thing that he can accomplish as a Texas Builder Bloke is to join an afterschool club. And there ain't no ♥♥♥♥ from this school, hell no: They have a mother♥♥♥♥in' ROBOTICS club, where they build ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ robots that do ♥♥♥♥ in competitive mode, and then, as seems to be a pivotal point of this thing, they have a garage where they build gliders.\nRemember gliders?\nNo?\nWell, if you play this, you'll learn more aerodynamics than you'll ever care to know about gliders. You will meet an absolute 10/10 girl, and she's ♥♥♥♥ing obsessed, to the ♥♥♥♥ing max, with gliders. She is building a ♥♥♥♥ing glider, and has literally not spoken to anyone for the past three years. Naturally, your character decides that it'd be absolutely awesome to go and join this club, and then goes home.\nOh, yeah, his 'house'.\nFor some reason, this absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ he calls his Mum thinks it'd be some top banter to send him to a girl's dormitory, and then tells him on the day that he's going to be looking after about four or five absolutely adorable girls that are his age, or older. One of them has legs that don't ♥♥♥♥ing work or some ♥♥♥♥, and she skips school and hates everything and her best friend is a duck wearing a fedora.\nLet me just pause so I can consider that I have not gone slowly insane.\nOK, I'm back.\nRight, so like I was saying, you look after these girls, and one of them, called Kanako (I remember this because she my bae), is literally one of your new best friends and keeps wandering about in her underwear. For some reason, your self-cockblock of a character doesn't like this, and keeps telling her to put clothes on.\nSucka got no game.\nAh...what else?\nOh yeah, you have your old friend with pink hair that could probably beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of you, you have that absolutely effortless 10/10 chick that makes planes, and then the paraplegic girl.\nAnd her sister.\nOhhhh, her sister is ♥♥♥♥ing adorable.\nOh, ♥♥♥♥, where was I?\nEch.\nIt's OK.\nTL;DR: You lazy ♥♥♥♥.

It's not a game that will satisfy expectations of intense drama, but it has an encouraging beauty to it that reminds us some dreams are worth pursuing. Its presentation is outstanding in both music and graphics, and it's surprisingly enjoyable to just sit and watch the images.

It will give you many mixed emotions during the story. If you havent bought this game already i would recommend you buy it.\n\nNow if you are like me and are worrying if you should invest your precious $15 on a novel, dont worry about it, it took me 23.9 full hours of nonstop playing to even complete one of the many possible endings.

In fact- I do recommend it. However, I don't recommend you bother with this steam version of the game. While the story is pretty good as visual novels go, this particular version is mired with two main issues: heavy censorship and blind-idiot translation.\n\nThe censorship is one thing- it's a bit Orwellian in this case how far they've gone to make it completely PG, to the point of completely destroying one character's route (rather famously), but to be honest this is the lesser problem. What the slightly bigger problem is that they haven't done anything to deal with the voices, which sometimes end up saying the uncensored lines instead (I'm pretty sure you don't need any formal education in Japanese to be able to distinguish the words breasts and eyes).\n\nBut again, this is fine in comparison to the real reason why I cannot recommend this game: from what I can tell, it was translated by a lot of different people, some of which did not know the characters at all, and their raw translations were mashed together to create the final product. Really, there are points where characters apparently change gender in the middle of a scene multiple times. There are cases I remember where one character's name (which is SPOKEN IN THE DIALOGUE) is replaced by another's. Honorfic translations are inconsistent (if I remember correctly) and this also creates a slight amount of confusion.\n\nYou know it's bad when you're reading a visual novel in your native language and you're correcting mistakes in the translation (incorrect nouns for the most part) from listening to the voice track.","May 20","false","0.3"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","16","18","3","0"

It's just most of the mediocre beginning and middle bits that really hold everything else back.\n\nAnd then there's the localization... oh the localization.  There's so much engrish and translation that doesn't quite pass even a basic spell check.  Then there's the censoring, there is a restoration patch... and it fixes some of that, but it's still enough that it's a real problem and should not get any sort of a pass.\n\nOverall, there are better options out there for whatever you want from this.  It's not pure schlock, but it's nothing special.","February 1, 2015","false","41.3"," 27 of 41 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","27","41","0","0"

That has recieved a hard-♥♥♥ gutpunch because of localization... While still keeping some of that magic that managed to make it a Experience.\n\nFirst off...\nStory/Writing/CharactersAs a Visual Novel, the first thing you would look forward is the competence and relevance of the happenings that binds together the Novel, in this department, depending on your likings, it can be a absolute roller-coaster, thrilling and interesting moments can be followed by a butt-load of exposition regarding Glider Construction facts that only a fraction of the public is interested about, however, as a whole, it can be quite touching and unique despite its few mood-whiplash moments.\nThe Story is shaky, and due to localization, Writing is both dancing over a concrete wall and tippy-toe'ing above a thin layer of ice above a massive abyss at times.\nInteraction between the cast is engaging and immersive, always remaining fluid and natural thoughout, the hinderance comes with the engrish present at times, mainly as a result turning a +18 Novel into a E-4-Evry1 Novel, some chunks of dialogue were completely destroyed, losing context and at times, resulting in awful typos every now and then.\nThe fact that your Cast of Characters is as charming as it is kinda makes other shortcomings to silently pass by the backdoor.\nYou have your tomboy childhood friend, a dreaming disabled introvert, a child-mind genius and two polar-opposite loli twins., the main character is your average boy and i would say at times he's kind of a derp, but he's the only remotely-questionable character, besides THOSE three fillers.\nIt must feel cliche, but the events that transpire though the Story will keep you binded to these characters, you learn their backstories and see that they are not as cliche as they initially seem, depending on how good is your affection and interest, they could even maybe become your waifu (But don't you touch Amane, she's mine ' c ').\n\nPlaytime/Soundtrack/GraphicsAs stated by the start of this review, this game has quite a good Duration, the combined routes all grant a lengthy dose of playtime, however, as stated in the previous Category, there are moments that feel like filler or quick hitches that can make the game drag.\nSpecially if you modded the Restore Patch like me, by enabling the H-Scenes, you probably make the game's duration to jump at least 10 hours because, to be brutally honest, these things can range from 25 to 45 mins, so be cautious.\nHowever, the one thing this game never had any problems was the Soundtrack, this thing makes me kinda feel bummed i didn't buy the Score Bundle, but ALAS, each song is greatly composed and it brings different flavors that make every happening ever so slighty more engaging, chracter voices are well-suited, characterized and there isn't a scenario where the acting is out of place.\nThe other thing is, much to my delight, the Graphics, beautifully well-constructed and in some scenario, they are quite beautiful, there are however, certain lapses when they can be innacurate or just plain lacking, particularily which the Character portraits.\nAgain, this is another case where the H-Scenes got the short end of the stick, and make it another reason why they are a drag).\n\ntl;drIn the end, while it has some certain humanic mistakes, it still shines brightly over all those little knick-knacks to offer a enjoyable and engaging adventure that can be quite the spectacle and leave you a glorious mark in your kokoro.\nWith unique story, candy graphics, outstanding sound and writing...\nIf My Heart Had Wings, earns the glorious-\nDuck/10","May 7","true","83.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","1"

I'm very impressed with the quality this VN presents (and I've played a few as well): little bits of animations, art style, voice overs, music.  From what I got out of the demo, I really like how the situations are presented, characters are distinctive and relatable, and it swept me up into the story.\n\nSo far, I'm only at the beginning (or where the demo ends), and so far, other than the extremely minor typos in translation, (which do not hinder my enjoyment at all) I'm loving it.\n\nI honestly don't think I should list out a boring banal list of pros and cons; just head over to their site, try out the demo, and see if you like it!\n\nI'll update this review with my full opinion once I've completed the game at least once.\n\nUPDATE: Finished the game with Ageha. And I will say that her route does not make sense. Even with the patch, it's still blotchy here and there.\n\nWow, there's a lot to be immersed in, seriously.  I'd find myself at one point angry and yelling at the screen because of that one.. sensei...  ANYWAY, for a game to get me yelling like that because of the story and not gameplay, that's fantastic; it means it has a great story!  Honestly, I can't imagine anybody not liking this game. Super 100% would recommend.  And if you think about it, I still have the other routes to complete, and I have absolutely no qualms about the story!\n\nPS: Installing the restoration patch (bringing back the h-scenes), I have very little to say about it.  Sure, it enhances the storytelling, and I didn't mind it at all.  There will be a few holes in storytelling, but it's really nothing too major. So I felt that it's not at all too necessary in terms of plot.  Without the patch, it'll just recap everything they said in a sex scene minus the 1000-page transcript of moaning, eerily vivid onomatopoeia, and whatnot.  Install it or don't, I have no doubt in my mind that you'll have an amazing experience with this VN.\nIf you also thought the fan patch fixed a lot of the typos in the translation, you are very very very wrong (possibly illiterate in English or just stupid). And to the dolts who think that most of the positive reviews came from the people who got a free copy from MN's giveaway, this is not the case; I purchased it.\n\nI do have my gripes about the game of course. Asa and Yoru are routes while Hotaru isn't?! Sorry for spoiling just a bit, but you'll understand as you go on (or maybe if you glazed through the achievements).  So -rationally-, it's in FLIGHT DIARY, but that ain't localized for English yet, sadly.\n\nWith all that said, I'll be finishing the other routes, and I hope this influences your decision to pick up this amazing VN.\n\nPSS: I had really awkward typos in this review that made it difficult to understand; it should be near perfect now.","November 25, 2014","true","64.5"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","22","35","0","3"

Hell yes, all my yes, it's an adorable story and the characters just as adorable.\nBut sadly, due the the poor translation, it could be hard for some to follow at times.\nIt's still playable, a lot of the translation is fine, but a re-translation project is in the works by fans of the game so either play now and re-play it (totally worth doing) once the re-translation is finished, or wait for the re-translation project to finish, and buy it then.\n\nSo, skip the Sakura games and pick this up, this game is worth your money far more than all of them combined.","December 26, 2015","true","100.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

Each of the alternative Endings provides a unique variation on the main story line that leads to BAD End should one make the wrong choices.  Naturally, I found Bad End on the very first run-through.\n\nThe soundtrack is great, easy listening.  It captures the sense of soaring the glider provides for the characters.  The theme songs are accompanied by English lyrics for those who are Japanese-challenged.  An included feature is a BGM collection of Soundtracks.  There also is a gallery of CG art.  Many of the pictures may be clicked to enable viewing of a series of views of those scenes.\n\nThe Protagonist is a male Academy student {Aoi => Ah-oh-ee; no inflection} who just transferred from an all-boy school back to his home town following a serious Racing Cycle road accident.  Fortunately {?} his mother arranged a job for him to keep him busy and help take his mind off his injury woes.  The down side {again; ?} is that his job involves being "House Mother" for an all-female, off campus, Academy dorm.  Remember now, his mother set this up!  And so the story goes ...\n\nThe story lines are entertaining.  The Title theme revolves around a girl {Kotori = “Little Bird”} who has lost use of her legs and is therefore confined to a wheelchair.  It can be difficult {at least for me} to figure out just how to reach each Ending.  That's the challenge!  The purported game length is 30 hours {I suppose for someone who knows what he/she is doing}.\n\nA detraction is that the translation job is sloppy ... even careless {perhaps just for me; I have a technical editing background and grammatical errors just seem to pop up frequently}.  Still, it IS understandable and proceeds smoothly if one ignores those minor mistakes.  It reads as though noone who knew English bothered to read the finished story.  For instance, wrong-gendered pronouns pop up frequently.  One of the main female characters had lost a dear friend.  For a long time, I assumed "he" was a boy.  WRONG !!  "He" turned out to be a "she".  Voicing still is in Japanese but I found that to be no problem.\n\nOverall, I found this to be an enjoyable gaming experience and strongly recommend it to any Gamer who may be interested in Visual Novels.","March 2","true","200.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poruxkai/recommended/326480/","poruxkai","『Poru』","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poruxkai/","60 products in account","Like many visual novels, a large part of the game is falling in love with and then dating the girl of your choice. If My Heart Had Wings is rather strong in this regard as it has a diverse and well-rounded cast. There is Ageha, the childhood best friend character who is transitioning from tom boy into a popular girl; Amane, an eccentric genius who has repeatedly failed her senior year in order to remain in the Soaring Club; Asa, the cute, excitable (and totally inept) freshman; and Yoru, Asa's twin sister and seemingly polar opposite.\n\nHowever, the main girl of the story, Kotori, is by far the most interesting character in the cast. While in some ways a typical tsundere character, she—like the cast of 2012's excellent Katawa Shoujo—has a physical disability, namely the loss of the use of her legs. Much of the story centers around her dealing with—and striving to overcome—her disability while at the same time looking at the psychological effect on a teenage girl of losing the ability to walk.\nhttp://kotaku.com/5905626/that-game-about-dating-disabled-girls-is-excellent-and-you-should-play-it\n\nThe player character, Aoi, also has a physical disability (a messed up knee); and while it does not affect his everyday life, it does prevent him from pursuing his passion, cycling. It is through his understanding of their respective losses that he is able to get her to open up little by little.\n\nLoss is the central theme of If My Heart Had Wings—be it physical or emotional loss—and each character is used to explore that concept in their own unique way. From there, the story looks at the dilemmas stemming from loss—like the difference between “making a fresh start” and “running away from your problems” and the difficulty of finding a new passion in life.\n\nAnother strength of If My Heart Had Wings is how it takes an obscure hobby, in this case gliders, and over the course of the game educates you about it. You learn about everything from basic aerodynamics, to glider flight, to the actual process of building a glider. And along with the personal and emotional stakes of the story, these sections of exposition are not only interesting but also often serve as vital plot points as the story goes on.\n\nLike many Japanese visual novels, If My Heart Had Wings had several explicit sex scenes upon its original release in Japan. However, all of these scenes have been cut wholesale from the game and additional nude or risque scenes have been heavily edited in the Western version.\n\nSome of these edits result in scenes that seem silly in context—like a girl inexplicably wearing a full body towel while bathing alone (and holding a separate bath towel) or describing one of the female character’s “big round eyes” while the camera and spoken Japanese dialogue are clearly focused on her chest.\n\nStill, edits or no, the meat of the story itself seems largely unaffected by these cuts and its emotional resonance remains superb.\n\nWhen it comes to the visuals, I generally enjoyed the overall art style of the game, but there was one glaring exception. For the most part, the game is told via a collection of 2D character models over 2D backgrounds. However, from time to time there is a scene of the glider flying—and for some reason the glider is, unlike nearly every other model in the game, a 3D model. Simply put, the styles clash. But even more than that, because of the pixelated edges, the model already looks dated.\n\nWhat's odd about this choice is that there is already a fair amount of clever animation in the game—shaking the screen and changing the cockpit view during take-off or watching the dotted line on a road pass underneath you as you ride a bike, for example. So there's really no reason the glider needed to be an ugly 3D model.\n\nBut despite the occasional out-of-place 3D model or odd bit of censoring, If My Heart Had Wings really is an excellent visual novel. If you enjoy a good, romantic, slice-of-life story from time to time or have ever dreamed of flying above the clouds, this game won't let you down.\n\nIf My Heart Had Wings was released for the PC in English on June 28, 2013, and can be purchased at MangaGamer[www.mangagamer.com].\n\n","September 4, 2015","true","19.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","3"

The characters were lovable (Amane-senpai is waifu), the premise is unique and surprisingly not many eroge could provide such backstory to the characters.\n\nFact is, MoeNovel actually butchered the story so much it was quite confusing at some points. The H-scenes were censored severely to the extent where story progression was  compromised. Also, I believe where Ageha's route is concerned, the progression left many of  us confused wondering what exactly happened during some parts (No Spoilers) I have to agree thanks to the fan restoration patch (Google it) I was able to understand what exactly happened between the two (Ageha & Aoi) so do try to install the patch if you find Ageha charming (She's apparently annoying to me)\n\nSo overall I guess it was okay for a not so eroge visual novel that was supposed to be an eroge (Boom,R.I.P Brain cells) Censorship helps spread the game to a wider audience I agree to that, but nevertheless MoeNovel should at least consider doing a better job at censorship without having butchered some story/character progression.\n\nI'd rate the game a solid 8/10 thanks to the enjoyment of Kotori and Amane's route. Seriously heartwarming. Good job PullTop.","July 21, 2015","true","55.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

I heard about the original (tho i never tried it myself) and most would say the original version is more completed than the one on Steam. Cutting stuff out and making it available for a younger audience is understandable to a fault. Then again it just feels like you miss out on some important story elements.. in my opinion. Anyways to sum it all up i would give it a 7/10.\n\nNow for a liitle more detail on the pros and cons of the VN.\n\nPros:\n- The story is great and enjoyable.\n- Artwork of the game is very well done.\n- It has replay value (I'm for sure going to read it again).\n\nCons:\n- The translantion could use a little more imporvement (All tho it still is understandable).\n- Story is good as said above, but it just feels like some parts of it are missing.\n- Not many choices to shape the story.","January 20, 2015","true","62.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/recommended/326480/","Yureina","Yureina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/","463 products in account","Mmm... okay, I better get this review over with.\n\nThis is a dating sim, essentially. Though chances are you already figured it out. I ended up grabbing this on a whim at one point and eventually got around to playing it. As far as these sorts of games go, much is as you expect: high school, male lead with no voice acting, and a bunch of female leads that are some personality archetype with some added twists (like the Tsundere being bound to a wheelchair). What is new is the sheer volume of info this game throws at you about aerodynamics, and while that was interesting... its more info than the game needed.\n\nActually, having "too much" is something I can throw at this game in a general way. It takes ~15 hours or so to go through one of the routes, but it feels longer than that as it is slow paced and has huge gaps where little of interest happens. This is not helped by the game having so few choices (and very simple ones at that) it almost feels like a Kinetic Novel (please be one or the other). In truth, I didn't even read all the text in this game because after the first playthrough (Kotori) I started skipping large amounts of dialogue that I hadn't seen yet because I knew nothing interesting was going to end up happening in a particular scene. Or rather, since basically every route of this game ultimately ends up in the same place, the "new" scene was basically the exact scene again with perhaps some slightly altered text. A VN that does this... has a pretty serious problem.\n\nAnother thing this VN has too much of is drama. Now... drama is good, and some of my favorite VN's live off of it (Steins;Gate, Clannad, Little Busters!). But unlike those games, the drama here feels... fake somehow. The biggest story problems come from scenes that involve this teacher who has a MASSIVE petty grudge against your club and its long-standing member, Amane. He has "reasons", but he comes across as the most petty of fools desperately trying to cling to what little authority they might have in a feeble attempt to try to seem relevant. It does not help that, aside from Amane's storyline, you never find out what his weak excuses for being a massive jackass are. Unfortunately, since one of the most recent  "new" anime/VN's i've watched/played was Higurashi... I spent much of my time while playing this game thinking of all the fun ways I wish this teacher would die horribly. And it never happened. Where is Sonozaki Shion when you need her? :(\n\nUp to this point, you probably think I'm going to give this game a negative review. And trust me... this game is a hair away from me having done so. However, for much of what this game gets wrong, it gets too many other things right for me to do that and feel confident in doing so. Either that or I'm just sick of getting my negative reviews panned simply for being negative.\n\nSo what does this game do right? Well, the characters can be quite interesting and some of them are better than average. Kotori, while far from my favorite character, has a rather serious and memorable storyline about overcoming her personal tragedy (being unable to walk due to an accident) and what that does to a young girl psychologically who had lived a normal life up until that point. The other routes are a mixed bag: Ageha's was hard to enjoy, Amane's was filled with drama but ultimately heartwarming, Asa's was nice and huggly, and Yoru's was... weird. It was Yoru who ended up being my favorite character simply by being a snarky genius (she kinda reminded me of Makise Kurisu from Steins;Gate) that was a massive breath of fresh air in the second half of the game. In a game filled with airheads or the often-depressed, Yoru was entertaining and made me laugh quite alot. Sad that she and her twin Asa are lolis and that her route was... what it was.\n\nThe side characters tend to be pretty good too, except for that teacher and the idiot male tsundere Masatsugu. Kanako was fun too, though having her being the fan service girl by walking around half-dressed for much of her screentime was lame. Another character worth mentioning is Tatsuya, or A-chan, who sadly doesn't get much screen time but would have been great if he did. He kinda reminded me of being an older grown-up version of Natsume Kyousuke from Little Busters!, though Kyousuke is still better. Also the art was pretty good. Mostly.\n\nUltimately, if it wasn't for Yoru, story moments that were genuinely heartwarming, and the pretty art, I would have given this game a bad review. Maybe i've just played too many VN's lately and seen too many similar but better things that I am being much more mean to this game than I otherwise would have. My two recent VN's were Higurashi (woohoo paranoid terror) and Eden (;_;), both of which were quite good (Higurashi especially). This game just does not compare well compared to those, but I can't call it bad without feeling a little dishonest. But just barely.\n\nOne last thing: the translation is ♥♥♥♥. Also this game has very heavy (and uneven) censorship, but I don't want to get into that issue because its been brought up plenty by other people elsewhere. You basically either have to play this as a bad localization or as an eroge. And while I no longer believe that all eroges are porn-fests that lack story (see the works of Key/VisualArts), I still don't like it. The lack of middle ground here depresses me. :(\n\nAnyway, I guess this game is ok. I very reluctantly give this game a "yes" because there is no "maybe" options and i've given worse games than this "yes" in the past. Also because people who comment and vote on Steam reviews suck. Yes, I'm talking about you. o_O\n\nBwee...\n\nEdit: Time has given me a more generous perspective on this game. Is it great? No. But it's not quite as bad as I had made it out to be. Still, much of what I wrote in this review stands, and the sheer volume of wordiness in parts of this game where interesting stuff just isn't happening guarantees i'll never play this game in its entirely again.","August 16, 2015","true","35.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

One of the best VN's on steam and is great for it's price: the game is fairly long, so what you pay is what you get. At times the game may seem slow, but it's a great buildup for the humor, sadness, joy and suprise that it hold. After a while of playing, you will start to feel a build of connection towards the characters of their personality, drama, life. Recommended for those who absolutely love VN's with a great connection towards the characters and story (even for those who are interested in VN's and want to begin somewhere).","December 24, 2014","true","46.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It's images are high quality, it's interface is customizable, and it really set's itself apart from other VN's. Each story line is eunique and the characters are really well developed. I was also glad to see that they took the erogenous scenes out of the american verson, and then someone patched them back in. It allows for people like me to opt out of the erogenous scenes.

But this game is right up there with grisaia. The characters in this game are very likeable and just made laugh and smile. The voice over and translations are good (Do Note played the game with the restoration patch and Sweet Love applyed) The game graphics look really nice and there are beautiful scenes. The games story is really touching and sweet. At parts of this game my eyes were actually tearing up. The length is also good it took me around 15 hours to complete my first route (Kotori) Overall this is a fantastic VN so if your a fan of VN's then I would highly recomend this game. (I do have to recomend that you take the time to install the restoration patch and get working if you play this game though. Applying the restoration patch does disable the steam achievements though) After finishing all route with the path I move my files to another folder and reinstalled the game to skip through to get the achievements. I then deleted the game files and moved the patched files back. Have the patched version with all my save data and got all the achievements :)","July 18, 2015","true","60.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It may say I've only played for 0.5+ hours thats because I pirated the game (DON'T HATE PLS) After playing the game for a while, I wanted to support the company that made this visual novel\n\nI am going to review this as a VISUAL NOVEL, not a game. I've seen a lot of people make this mistake. They review visual novels as a video game with gameplay and etc etc. Note that this is going to be a casual review not a serious one. This is my first review that I have done. Enjoy\n\nReview:\n\nStory: 9/10\nOkay. The story starts off with our protagonist, Aoi, going back to his hometown because of his injury during a cycling race. As Aoi is walking through his hometown he meets a girl in a wheelchair named Kotori. Her wheelchair is flat and Aoi fixes it etc etc. Lets keep moving on because I want to finish this ASAP. Aoi arrives at a dorm which he is going to live called "Flying Fish Manor" little did he know that it was a girl's dorm. Kotori also lives in the dorm. (Opinion time!!): Ok, when I first saw him entering the girl's dorm, the first thing that came on my mind is "Awww crap. He's gonna get a harem". (Opinion time ends). Aoi goes back to school and meets his childhood friend, Ageha. They catch up etc etc. Aoi stumbles across a garage which is actually the "Soaring Club". The Soaring Club only has one member which is Amane. Kotori, Ageha and Aoi joins the Soaring Club to fulfill a dream which is to soar the skies and to see the morning glory clouds.\n\nCharacters: 9/10\nI really like the characters compared to other REALLY good visual novel characters. They have full voice acting, extremely well designed. Each character has a role and isn't there just to fill up the void. The characters each have a unique personality.\nKotori Habane: Strong willed, confident. Sometimes a cry baby\nAgeha Himegi: Typical tomboy (A really cute one as well)\nAmane Mochizuki: An airheaded, super genius, super repeat student.\nAsa Kazato: A bright, warm girl. Clumsy and a bit airheaded.\nYoru Kazato: Yoru is Asa's twin. Her personality is complete opposite from her sister's. She is also attached to her sister.\n\nArt/Sound: 8/10\nLets talk about the art first. The art is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. nuff said... Now the sounds. The music/sounds is composed really well. Well enough to make you want to play more of this visual novel. The music/sounds fit the events that occur and at some points sound really soothing.\n\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9.2/10\nI just noticed how much time I spent on this review. Haha. The visual novel overall is amazing! Nice characters, great art/sounds, really good story. It tells you a lot of information about gliders as well!! There was only a few bad points about this game which is mainly the translation of the visual novel. As you progress through the visual novels you will notice the typos. The visual novel will provide you 20-30 hours of gameplay (reading), a few choices, 5 girls to choose from which is definitely worth the price which is 15 dollars. Especially when it can give you a free ticket to the feels train. I really enjoyed this visual novel and hoping to see more from MoeNovel. So if you like romance, slice of life visual novels. I definitely recommend this visual novel to you!!\n\nLadies and Gentlemens, my name is Top Neps and I shall be ending this review.

I can play GTA 5 and interatively TORTURE a man, and that's OK. I can see THE 3D ♥♥♥♥ of a stripper, SEE THE SEX I AM HAVING WITH A GOD DAMN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, BUT HEAVEN FORBID I SEE A BRA FROM SOMEONE GETTING WET, OR SEE A WOMAN'S NIPPLES. Steam I would like to remind you that it is not  a crime for a woman to be topless she can have her boobs out, and most of these games from Japan do a certian amount of censoring anyway. I understand not wanting to have a game that is essentially porn, but the sex scences are very short. I enjoy them purely under a pregression point, it makes the relationship seem real,  because people have SEX, it's part of life, and to hide it cheapens our lives on the whole. I genuinely want a refund because you had the 18+ gate on the game, and I just can't accept this. I understand with The Devil on G-String why you censored that it had an incest route that might look bad for your image.

Anyway lets get on to the review.\n\nStory: Now since this is a review I will try my best to not spoil much for some of the people who planned to get the game or haven't started on it yet. My Heart Had Wings story focused on a highschool club by the name of the '' Soaring Club '' which consist of the characters Aoi ( Main Male Character ), Kotori ( Main Girl Character ), Ageha ( Childhood Friend ), Amane ( Leader of the Soaring Club ) and later on Asa and Yoru ( Twins ). There are different routes for this VN but I will only talk about the main story ( Kotori ). Kotori your typical tsundere character but with a physical disability, she loss her use of her legs due to an accident. Our main male character (Aoi) also suffered a physical disability, his knee has problems that prevent him from continuing his passion from cycling. At first Kotori hates Aoi but since Aoi is able to understand her due to their losses, as time goes on Aoi managed to make her gradually open up. But enough of these 2, lets talk about the Soaring Club. The Soaring Club undergo many losses and sacrifices, whether it is emotionally of physically, each member suffered through different events that occur in the VN and you just became so immersed into story that you to see them overcome their problems.\n\nVisuals: The visuals of this game is absolutely stunning to the eyes. Every scene was drawn incredibly well and coloured with bright and vagrant colours. However, in 3D glider flights scenes, the glider itself looks ugly and old.\n\nAnimation: The animation was very well done as well. During glider scenes, there are some scenes with shaking screens or even when the glider was about to took off. These kind of scenes have some kind of an impact to the reader as they allow them to experience what the characters are experiencing.\n\nSound: My god. The sound themselves fits every scene well. No matter what kind of situation, whether it is good or bad, the sound themselves just made the scene so much better.\n\nMy Final Score For My Heart Had Wings is 9/10, This is a very good VN that worth every penny and time. (P.S sorry if many of you find this not helpful, this is my first time writing a review.)","April 8, 2015","true","36.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With a very touching story this is leaps-and-bounds beyond most non-port (Western) VNs.  Sadly however, as with most ports of japanese games, multiple scenes/CGs from the original have been removed from the English version to allow the rating to expand to be more inclusive.  Sadly, as a result, this leads to a negative impact on the VN's story.\n\nI highly recommend this VN: 8/10\nThe English port is meh~: 5/10\n\nFinal Conclusion:  This VN is well worth the read, in original form, but not worth the $15 asked for Steam's dumbed-down version.  If you really want to buy this on Steam go online and download the JPN to ENG fix patch to translate the removed scenes/CGs and re-add them to the game.  This works about 80% of the time.  If this fix doesn't work for you then I highly recommend returning this game on Steam and downloading the JPN version from elsewhere.","June 15, 2015","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To truly enjoy this game, it is highly advised you apply the Restoration Patch which puts the cut material such as references to sex and kissing back into the game. Plus you get to have sex with Amane which is the highlight of the game.\nThe plot is rather decent, and the characters all grow on you as you continue through the game. The OST is lively and really captures the atmosphere of soaring in a glider.\n\nBe warned, the patch does introduce some sprite glitches that were never resolved.

The story is about Aoi Minase who comes back to his hometown which he haven't been to since 5 years. The first thing he does is to visit the new windmills that has been built when he was gone. He encounters a mysterious girl who's in a weelchair and they chat for some time. The real reason why Aoi is back is a job that he accepted from his mom, he's to work as a dorm mother for students. What he didn't know is that it's a dorm for girls, of course there's bound to be troubles. Much to Aoi's surprise the girl he met earlier on the windmill hill lives in that dorm (what a coincidence) but her personality has greatly changed from his view. Next morning on his way to the new school a cute girl calls out his name. She is Aoi's childhood friend Ageha and is in the same class as Aoi. They walk the road to school together whilst having a long-time-no see talk. I'm not gonna spoil anymore then that, please forgive me, I wrote more then I intended. Guess I got carried away thinking about this and it became more of a Summary then a review, oh well can't be helped. I finished the game with the Ageha route in about 14 hours (depends if you're a fast reader) but there are many other routes to take depending on your choices.

You will expect to learn a lot about gliders and planes, things about aero, how wings types effect the plane and thermals etc. A fair warning though, if you dont like planes you might get fed up for the rambling regarding the plane because boy they talk a lot about that plane.\n\nThe charecters are very varied, you dont really have any charecter that could be taken out of the game and not be missed, they complament eachother rather well which isnt very easy to do judging by some of the other stuff out there on the market.\n\nThe choices, this is a game which wants to play every route more then other visual novels, yes some people replay because they like more then one female and yes if you get the naughty patch then pantsu will hit the floor and yes their method of describing the "events" unfolding are hilarious. Anyways you will want to go though all of the charecters because they all fed into the past and future of the storyline, its like a jigsaw which needs to be finished. Endings seem pretty happy id say, well so far but i dont think this is the type of game to kill off and break a heart. Each route is very indepth, seriously it takes like 7-10 hours per route depending on your pace for reading.\n\nArtwork is very nice and thank you devs for making a game that works at 1080p, scary i know but japanese devs dont understand this crazy concept, no way 1080p in 2015 what madness.\n\nMusic is nothing to scream over but it serves its purpose, it doesnt break immersion but it doesnt add to it very well.\n\nOverall its rather good, not sure if id call it amazing, take in mind that if you add the patch to the game which you will because they ripped out 40% of the game(5% of that is naughty scenes) then achievements will stop working.\n\nWell £11 for 50+ hours of content. Cant complain about that, its on steam so you know the rules, get it on sale.","August 24, 2015","true","24.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

To be honest, I was taken off-guard by the writing as well as the amount of effort the devs put into character development and story. There are 5 potential love interests in the game, all of which are interesting and engrossing characters who develop as you unfold their respective paths. While some repetition between paths exists, there is more than enough new content for each path you take in order to make it feel fresh and interesting in its own right. The devs even included a 'skip all read' option, allowing you to shirk past all dialogues that you have previously encountered, stopping at new sections of story for you to read at your leisure.\n\nIMHHW has a beautiful art style, wonderful characters and captivating writing; all of which are set in a beautifully created town. However, one critique would be that the devs often relied on repeated poses for characters as well as using what I feel was the same 20 backdrops throughout the whole game. That being said, this IS my first visual novel but considering my first playthrough took 28 hours, I was expecting more backdrop variation.\n\n8.5/10 gets the Llama thumbs up.","March 29, 2015","true","29.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kiteee/recommended/326480/","Kiteee","Kite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kiteee/","234 products in account","A review with minor introductory story details.\n\nIf My Heart Had Wings (Kono Ōzora ni, Tsubasa o Hirogete) is a visual novel centered around a group is students in the soaring club, a school club primarily focused on aviation. Surprisingly there is more than romance to this story as the main objective of group is to fulfill the dream of flight. I wasn't expecting to listen to several detailed explanations of glider aerodynamics and construction but I found them interesting. The story itself is mostly light hearted and humorous but at the same time has dramatic, emotional moments.\n\nVisually, this visual novel is very pleasing. The art is done very well with many vibrant colors and gives a unique look. The soundtrack is spot on when it needs to be and very tame during normal sequences. In the settings menu allows a lot of customization, such as pausing the game when it is off screen or even changing the announcer's voice to any of the characters.\n\nUnfortunately, the game does suffer censorship and certain routes will seem less developed than others. Translations will be a bit cringey at times with americanization. I'll be blunt and say that the censored version of this games acts like sex doesn't even exist. It's painfully obvious when they tweak a scene to skip an eroge scene in the original. I personally recommend using the 18+ restoration patch to have better translations (just skip the eroge scenes).\n\nMy Opinion on the routes:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKotori - The best route. Clearly the most developed and gives the most satisfaction when reading.\n\nAmane - The next best route. Fills in a lot of details that are unexplained in other routes.\n\nAgeha - I found this route frustrating. Lots of angst and melodrama. Sometimes I don't even know what's happening and                I have to reread the dialogue because of out of character interactions. The censored version of this route is especially butchered through censorship. The story and jokes will make no sense.\n\nAsa - Partaking in this route doesn't seem realistic to the story. Almost feels like you ignored past experiences and immediately started befriending the loli.\n\nHarem - I don't take this one seriously at all.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is currently one of the better visual novels on Steam right now. If you're even slightly interested in visual novels I would give this a try, especially if it's on sale. You get a lot for what you pay for with If My Heart Had Wings.\n\nNotes:\n- Length is 50+ hours if you include all routes. The common route is around 10 hours and each character specific route is about 15 hours (assuming you listening to the voice acting).\n- There is voice acting.\n- Certain routes cannot be done until you complete other routes.\n- There are a total of 5 routes + 1 bad end.\n- There is a eroge focused sequel based off of the aftermath of Kotori's route.\n- This is the censored version of this visual novel. It can be patched to the 18+ version to unlock eroge scenes and several translation fixes. Unfortunately this makes the game a bit unstable (sometimes sprites will be stuck on the screen, gallery is out of order, and in a specific scene the screen is stuck on a blank white image). Achievements will be locked if you decide to use the patch. There is a Steam guide that shows you how to apply this patch if you need help. Do note that there are separate guides for Windows 7 and Windows 8. If you're interested in applying this patch, be prepared for lengthy eroge scenes with voice acting. You have been warned.\n- Originally released in May 25, 2012 in Japan.","April 9, 2015","true","54.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If after playing it you don't feel anything, if you haven't cried at least once, there is something seriously wrong with you. I've been isolated like a few of the charcters in this game, and reading through it gives me hope for a bright future. This visual novel (because to be honest, it can't really be classified as a game by any definition) is so touching and is worth your time. Your first playthought will be between 25-30 hours, and after that you'll be able to skip most of it to finish all of the other routes, or reread it and enjoy it all over again. There are parts where you laugh, cry, and just start dancing (there is some pretty good music to go along with this novel) I'd personally recommend installing the restoration patch before playing, as the censorship in it is pretty bad (Check the forems for a how to). Fair warning, the sex scenes are pretty descriptive and may make a few people uncomfortable. Overall, between all the different routes, getting to know each character, and seeing each one's ending, i've been inspired to look for the best in people, something i haven't done in as long as i can remember, and find someone who i can share a dream with!","February 19, 2015","true","81.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is one of the better ones. Some of the translations are a bit off, but I've played others which were much worse. Overall the story is very good. The characters, artwork, and music are good. The only complaint I have is the extremely poor handling of bringing the VN to western audiences by removing the adult content. I don't mind that the adult content is removed. Generally the adult scenes do not really add much to the underlying story. But the way in which it is removed in this game is terrible. Its as if reading a book and someone has just ripped out random pages. Especially during the Ageha ark which is just unplayable and incomprehensible. If they had just toned scenes down (Like how they added towels in the bath scenes versus being nude) and left the content in, that's one thing. But it seems as if Moe Novel just cut scenes out without putting anything in leaving us readers wondering just what is going on.\n\nI plan on downloading the restoration pack I read about in the discussions, as well as buying the actual Japanese game (I understand some Japanese).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TranzRail/recommended/326480/","TranzRail","TranzRail","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TranzRail/","178 products in account","Here's my thoughts on "If My Heart Had Wings"\n\n[Story]\nThe story is decent but certain elements are a bit long winded. There is a lot of detail pertaining to glider construction and operation, which can be quite distracting. Other than that, this visual novel is what you would expect - your typical high school male is surrounded by females, who (very little effort on his own) is able to attract their attention (player choice depending). The two elements that drew me into playing this visual novel was the prominence of a character with a disability and the concept of a "soaring club" at high school. Combined, these two elements work well together to create a unique story. The individual character story arcs are all really good at allowing the player to connect on one level or another, and you are left feeling somewhat emotionally connected to them (at least, that's how it was for me).\n\nIf this particular visual novel isn't to your liking, and you're after a real tear-jerker, I thoroughly recommend CLANNAD (despite its price, it is worth every penny).\n\n[Translation]\nI did notice more than several issues with the English translations, some of which are quite big, others are small mistakes (such as missing a letter). Having played only one other visual novel prior to this (that being CLANNAD), the translation absolutely needs some work.\n\n[Graphics]\nThe native resolution is 1280x720. Having played this in fullscreen mode at a resolution of 1920x1080, I noticed that during certain scenes that had a zoom-in effect, the picture quality becomes a bit blocky on the focused area. However, this isn't often given the length of the visual novel, and doesn't really hurt it overall.\n\n[Sound]\nI had no issues with the sound quality. Audio appeared clean, and clear. Since I don't know Japanese, I can't really grade the voice acting.\n\n[Compatibility]\nNo issues on Windows 8.1 x64.\n\n[Notes regarding Censored Version]\nThis game has a much merkier past, though a fair number of visual novels do. This game was originally 18+ due to the adult content. This particular version, is throughly censored throughout compared to the original (abeit, there are one or two scenes which some might argue should have got the chop too). It wasn't until after I played the Steam version that I became aware of the missing content. After reading the reviews on Steam, I opted to try out the community patch for purely academic purposes. After playing through at least two character routes, I can say that despite the Steam version being censored, the story does a good job of standing on its own (by which I mean, the removal of the adult content has not created gaps in the story). I feel that the adult content (for the most part) was an unnessecary addition to the game, unless you are specifically looking for a game with those sorts of interactions and depictions.\n","February 23","true","42.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found this a very original subject to base the story lines on. Even though some parts of the story were a bit technical, it didn't bother me. In this VN there are 5 possible girls to date and with the bad ending, this makes 6 possible outcomes. But for some of the options to open, you have to clear the Kotori route.\n\nI started with the Kotori route and that alone took me 20 hours. While I did like her route, I did find it a bit too long, especially because there aren't that many choices to make. The Ageha route I finished in 6 hours, but this is because you can skip all scenes that you have seen before. But you can't skip the new scenes, so this way the game ensures you can't miss anything. Based on these two routes I do think that the game is made for the Kotori route and the other routes are just a nice extra. I think this is true for the Ageha route, at least. While they did try to bring some depth into it, it wasn't nearly as gripping as Kotori's route was. That being said, I have high hopes for the Amane route. I love the music they choose for the intro and ending. The rest is a bit repetitive but it does fit the mood of the moment well.\n\nThe one annoying thing about this game were the many spelling errors. For a large part of the game I didn't know if Isuka was a he or a she, because they kept saying it differently and you don't get to meet her in the Kotori route at least. I know there is a pack you can install that fixes this but I didn't do that because I saw it was a bit iffy and a lot of people had problems with the game after that.

It had several ending routes, many hours of gameplay, excellent voice-acting and art, and a soundtrack that gets me everytime. Unfortunately, MoeNovel removed all ecchi and hentai related scenes, but the experience was good nonetheless. The dialogue is mostly said by Aoi though, and the player cannot direct the flow of the conversation. Overall, I thought IMHHW was a great game, and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a bit of cheesy romance (in some cases XD).","August 31, 2015","true","21.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Telling the story through the eyes of our wounded protagonist, IMHHW delivers a heart-wrenching tale complete with loveable characters, visual beauty, and a soundtrack that ranges from bliss to despondency. The reader embarks on an emotional roller-coaster, travelling across the entire spectrum of thoughts and feelings, leaving them to ask, "How is it possible to become so attached to fictitious characters?" Much like a good novel, there is a certain melancholy readily apparent for the player when the tale is finished. "Why couldn't our story continue on forever?" Nonetheless, it is impossible not to smile meekly in hindsight at the trials and experiences of our protagonist, and wish him the best on his continued adventures in the cosmos of our imaginations.\n\nIMHHW is, of course, a visual novel, so the reader is not expected to interract within the game beyond passing through the dialogue provided by the story. There are a few critical questions asked of the player, which influence how the game proceeds; they are rare, but their importance cannot be understated. The characters themselves are deep, well established, and loveable; in fact, it is truly a forlorn sense of disappointment when some decisions in the game must be made between them. Beyond the literary exposition provided by the game's text, the characters are also aided by a gorgeous series of artwork. I was shocked by the detail and beauty presented in the story's art, and it added an additional dimension of presentation to not only the novel itself, but also to the development of the characters. Completing the triumverate of sensation is the music provided with the game; while certain events of the game, and the accompanying artwork, provide enough of an emotional pull, the music really brings the story to another level of excellence. We laugh with the characters; we cry with the characters; and together, we are immersed into this tale of young love and boundless expectation colliding with the sometimes cruel advacement of reality. I cannot speak too much on the quality of the voice acting, because I am not a fluent speaker, but each of the voices of the characters fit into their character archetypes and gave another level of realism to them.\n\nThe story itself is very long, but not too long; never is the reader left idle in a state of boredom. I took more than ten hours to finish the story, and I am an extremely quick reader; do not make my mistake of beginning this game after 4 PM, because if you find the story as engrossing as I did you will not be able to leave until it concludes (a long time into the next day!) I daresay it may be impossible for the average reader to finish this story in one sitting; I would recommend pausing after each chapter is completed (I believe the chapters are called "Movies" in the game itself).\n\nThere are a few grammatical errors in the dialogues, which I attribute to the translation efforts for the game. Most of them aren't significant issues; in fact, I am surprised that, over the course of literally thousands of lines of dialogue, there are only several mistakes that I noticed. The only egregious mistakes I noticed were in the gender of the pronouns; twice or three times, I noticed that a character is incorectly assigned a gender pronoun. This was only a major issue in one of the lines of dialogue (because it references an unmet character, so you are confused as to that character's gender). These complaints, however, should not factor into the consideration to purchase this story.\n\nThere is only one facetious complaint I will make. The authors of this novel have constructed a tale so emotionally engrossing that it will leave you thoroughly invested into the plot's outcome. Dare I say, the worst part of this visual novel is the fact that it had to end; that I had to bid goodbye to the characters I had grown so attached to; I had to face the sudden realization that none of the events of this story had actually happened. That fundamental attribute of this novel makes it comperable to any other literay work, such as a printed novel; and, despite the fact that I am saddened to have to leave this tale behind for now, I will thoroughly recommend it to any reader who wishes to enjoy such a story.\n\nI cannot make this final claim for certain, because I have only read through the novel once, but I am willing to believe that the ending will change fundamentally depending on the choices made in the game. If I had to guess (again, I have not played it through multiple times, so this is only conjecture), there may be as many as five endings to the game, which adds an incentive to return to the mythos of IMHHW. Thankfully, if that is the case, I am provided a reason to play through the story once again, and return to visit my fictional friends once more.","January 25","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlike others there's frequent scene changes, almost everything is animated or drawn, and there's even mini-animations outside of cutscenes! This is on a whole different level than any other VN I've ever played, and I've played a good deal.\n\nOther bonuses: did I mention the art is FLAWLESS?! I'm in love with the backgrounds. The sountrack is beautiful, and there's tons of voice-overs to go with the text. I think they do a good job of balancing the appeal between all the characters, usually I only feel attached to one or two. I'm really enjoying the story so far. I got so caught up in it that I read all through the night and ended up only getting a couple hours sleep. Oh, and I do reccomend getting the restoration patch. Without it you do lose some of the story.\n\nMy only complaint is that there are very few options to choose from on each route.

Obtained 'Bad Ending' (no routes) 21 hours in.\n\nI have next to no desire to re-read content just to play specific routes. I appreciate this is common for VNs, However the 'choices' for IMHHW were so anodyne re: who looks best in a bikini, whom do you wish to accompany to the supermarket, and were so few and far between, that I find it hard to retain any sense of credulity that such choices presented a potential route.\n\nPerhaps I'm playing in the mind-set of an early 40s British guy which is the issue, and one who is not completely au-fait with VNs. But I'll be damned if I will spend hours re-reading the same dialogue, especially narrative that wasn't terribly enthralling in the first place. Except for Armane (for obvious reasons), I never really felt a connection with the characters: Aoi felt like a diluted Murakami protagonist (minus the ubiquitous cat) , whilst Kotori had annoying mannerisms, especially her frequent open mouth - jabbing finger expression.\n\nI get that the game pushes you down the main [Kotori] route, but to such an extent that with the exception of Ageha, the relationships with other characters were hardly developed beyond the usual harem tropes.\n\nWhat it boils down to is that excellent production values and musical score aside (the standard to which all VNs shall be judged production wise), the actual narrative itself was fairly soporific.

I highly recommend it to those who are a big fan of visual novels. This visual novel is very well-balanced. Each heroine has their own unique story and twist, making every replay totally worth it. You'll also learn some things about friendship, romance and planes (gliders). The story's span can go for a lot of hours. (if you don't intend to skip the dialogues that is) It took me a handful of 50 hours to completely clear all five character routes. One playthrough is composed of two parts: (1) Prologue (2) Character Route. The VN's price is a bit high but it is totally worth it. Try to buy it when it goes on sale once again.\n\nI promise you, If My Heart Had Wings will make you smile and shed a tear. If you're a big visual novel fan or looking for a great visual novel to play on Steam, then this is a MUST BUY for you!\n\nNOTE:\nThe actual visual novel here on Stean doesn't have H-Scenes but a restoration patch is already available.","January 15, 2015","true","49.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Each route is a different in its own way and will give you more dept info about the game world.\nThis game includes 6 different routes:Kotori, Ageha, Amane, Asa, Asa&Yoru Harem and Bad end.\n\nStory it self is ok and at least for me it gave some goosebumps from time to time.\nRomance in this is also fine. There are about 4 points where you can choose what to do from usually 3 to 4 options, in each route.\nSome routes are easier than others, for example Asa and Yoru routes are the hardes ones and Kotori and Ageha are the easiest ones to reach.\n\nIf you play this first time I would recommend either Kotori OR Amane route first.\nThose both routes will give you the most answers and explanations about the story and whats actually happening.\nOthers routes are also fine and sweet but from experience, I would recommend to start with these.\n\nThere are some flaws in this game, big ones being that Ageharoute is really confusing since translating the jokes and some other parts were untranslatable or didn't make any sense what so ever. Its still playable but I found my self really confused and annoyed about whats happening and why, even with the restoration patch the route is slightly annoying but not as bad.\nOther flaws are that the creators, at least in my opinion focused too much on explaining how gliders etc work.\nThey made it so, that its really boring to read and skipping them wont affect on your knowledge on whats happening in the story one bit. On first playthrough it might be fun to read about an hour or two lasting scenes how glider acceleration and wind works, but when playing 2nd time, its just plain boring.\n\nI really recommend downloading the restoration patch even if your not a pervert. Reason for that is, that it will open some normal scenes which were censured since the little french girls would be offended and not like the game.\nHere is a good guide on how to get the Patch\nNOTE: When downloading the the patch you need to change some language setting in your computer or something. Those WONT affect in any way and you should not worry a thing. If it bother you, you can always switch it back.\n\nFinal score: 8/10. (rated from: 4 - 10)\nReason: Story and romance were sweet and all, but the trouble downloading the patch and the annoying moments downgraded the score.\n","May 27, 2015","true","58.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The atmosphere is good, fitting music (although way too repetitive) and nicely designed characters. However, this great experience slowly got ruined for me.\n\nWhile at first I noticed small translation errors, the moment the general route was over and I moved to a character route (Ageha) the text got really confusing, full of grammar errors and wrong subjects (you instead of I, etc.)\n\nWhile the art and atmosphere is lovely, the story was a bit too predictable and furthermore too stretched out. I had to really force myself to read through certain parts. That and way too many standard H-game stereotypes...\n\n\ntldr; Could have been great, but the standard characters, stretched out story and horrible translation (together with quite hard to fix censorship on Windows 8) makes it a below par game sadly...","July 22, 2015","false","77.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Art, music, voice acting, are all solid. The writing, while not entirely original, manages to sprinkle in anime tropes without being glaringly obvious. In other words it's a good read that doesn't tick off tropes from the "list" in such an obvious fashion as to make one roll ones eyes. If I had to make a complaint it would be the pacing at the start. While it's refreshing in a way that the game doesn't take the typical route of a slice of life anime where they have overly bombastic friends/situations to keep the tension high, I found myself pulled out of my immersion by my anticipation of when I'd actually be able to make a choice (Edit-will just enjoy the ride the next time). The writing is thoughtful and introspective, but like a warm summer day with nothing to do. It may occupy you but eventually you'll be shaken from your reverie having to acknowledge your boredom (worth waiting for the climax). Ymmv. For me it was probably amplified by the generally somber music.\n\n*Edit*\nWell it took me a while to finish as I got sidetracked a bit but man great ending. It's a bit of a roller coaster and a bit sappy at times but the payoff is great and in hindsight is supported rather well by a story that felt more like minced life instead of slice of life (aka got stuck in minutiae).\n\nWill play again.","December 4, 2015","true","72.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Considering the length of the novel though, I really can't hold that against it\n-Every character that matters is richly developed. It is very easy to become emotionally engaged with all of them. The side characters serve their purposes without being unneccessarily detailed.\n-I feel like the sheer length of the novel deserves praise (23 hours or so for me). I would expect a story about gliders and flight mechanics to be mostly niche appeal, but the heart of the story is independent from that.  The story is enticing by virtue of a common goal shared by well developed characters, and the story manages to sustain itself without boring phases.  Flight and flying mechanics are almost an aside and the techicalities are made accessible and actually interesting.\n\nNegatives:\n-I'm not sure what happened, but like halfway through the novel it's like the development was either rushed or handed over to someone less competent. There were no typos or bad translations in the first half, then for a while they are almost commonplace.  Not enough to ruin the novel obviously, but disappointing and confusing once it becomes noticeable.  At one point, the main character finds something handmade and wonders who made it.  The character in the wheelchair is blatantly referred to as "the cripple" and presumed incapable of folding some oragami thing.  Likely bad translation but pretty inappropriate and surprising it made it through revision.\n\nOverall, my all time favorite visual novel.  10/10","January 1","true","27.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And thats the localisation...\n\nJust to get that straight: I quite like the VN. The characters are good, the story has some interesting aspects and the soundtrack is good. The visuals are ok and the technical side of things is ok as well. There is that annoying "feature" that requires you to play some Routes prior to others, but that can be bypassed by just setting it do skip and auto and leaving the Room for 30 minutes to not spoiler yourself.\n\nBut the localisation is absolutely HORRIBLE. It seems like some amateurs done it in 5 days without sleep just keeping theirselves alive with energy drinks. Grammatical misstakes can occour and if its not common I can turn an eye off that one, but I had 2-3 of those per 5 minutes! And while most of those dont cripple the meaning of the sentence, there are some misstakes which (its no big spoiler, but I marked it anyway)  mix up the "Soaring Club" and the "Touring Club" calling the "Touring Club" "Soaring Club" and mixing up personal pronouns what lets you believe that the main cast has joined the "Touring Club" which is not the case!!!.\n\nI haven't played through the whole thing however I can say that you have to be quite good at understanding english and be quite careful while reading this, otherwise you will be quite irritated and end up not enjoing it. If you feel up to the task then go ahead and enjoy it, because if you understand all of it, you will not regret playing this title.","April 28","false","42.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

What you think I'm being harsh, cause I am, not that I find that it takes away from the awesome story at all. Seriously even with out the H scenes which I hear you can get back through the Restoration Patch that I found out after completed a whole route. To lazy to use it because I don't want to go through all of that again. So this game has a really, and I mean really good story to it and is worth the time you take to get it over and done with. I think it took me around 10 to 12 hours to do all of it, have no idea why my steam time says I've clock 14 hours. But it is a very good VN, well the story at least and that what makes me recommend it to you. If you want H scenes get the Patch it is linked in discussions on the game. It was good fun and I think the only things that trumps this in VN so far is fruits of grisaia in story and hours you rack up in it.","September 17, 2015","true","14.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Spelling, grammar, incorrect sentence structure, its as if the translation team literally spent 0 hours trying to translate this properly, and instead sent it through google translate.\n\nMy biggest personal qualm would have to be the still images. There is probably only 3 variations of each location. Of which there are about 10. Thats 30 images total. Put together with the different expressions and poses the characters are actually in, makes it seem as if they arent moving, they are simply being copy and pasted into a different place. Its very immersion breaking and kinda hilarious. Not in a good way. This is all just personal qualms, but they are prevelent through out the entire "game" (its not a game... there are like 5 decisions, which are totally stupid and seem utterly pointless)\n\nThe final issue i have with this game is the characters. Do i even need to say anything about Aoi? He is the luckiest son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ on earth, having nearly 20 beautiful women all near him. At an age where his hormones should have been RAGING (Hes 14-15, give or take a year or so). Sure hes awkward, but so much so he is utterly clueless for most of the novel. In fact, its almost like He was written to be a bland narrator instead of an actual changing person. I dont think i saw him one time in the entire novel say anything that wasnt unexpected or surprising. Not even when he was talking about his "injury" (he scrapped his knee. boohoo. hes a little ♥♥♥♥♥). Hell, even (WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS) when they learned what happened to isuka he acted like a emotionless robot narrator.\n\nThere are alot of Visual Novels that have been released first in japanese then translated into english for a steam release.\nYou really want a fantastic Visual Novel experience? Get Clannad, or Katawa shoujo, or the numerous others that are a higher quality when it comes to story, length, and characters\nDo not waste your money on this.","April 24","false","22.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This sounds extreme, but I mean it. The characters are very well done and actually lovable, the art quality is phenomenal and the voice acting is super well done (according to my Japanese friend)\nThere are negatives, so I'll state them right here: The translation job is bad at times. Typos are rare but happen enough to be consistent, and there was a character never shown on screen, whose gender was unkown, and the description kept popping from he to she to him to her, it was confusing.\nOh and obviously the game is censored to the extreme, because of Steam, but that's not really a negative, as this game is less hentai or even ecchi, and is more about the wonderful story and characters.\nPros? As said the characters are really easy to get attached to, the art is good, but what else? Well I can remember the soundtrack after I stop playing, so that's something.\nBut really, it's very long. Like, I mean, it takes 5 hours to get the THE INTRO MOVIE. Not only is it very very long, but it has multiple paths, so replay value is high especially with such well done girls (though some are more best than others, such as Kotori)\nAnd the game is really inspiring and uplifting to boot.\n\nI genuinely adore this VN, and would highly recommend it. One of the biggest pros of all, is it's on Steam, AND this good. It's a step in the right direction for Steam, after the several bad VNs that have been put on here. This along with Fault Milestone have changed my mind, and I welcome the genre.","May 9, 2015","true","11.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story is full of heart-touching emotion that leaves an effect on you.  My biggest complaint is that there is so much story, you cannot possibly just sit down and enjoy it all at once (unless you have no life, then by all means enjoy it from beginning to end!)  I have only completed one of the story arcs, and with I think five more to try, this story can keep me entertained for some time to come!   Even the music should have a special mention... it has a smooth melody that can easily slip into the background, but is can also be so noticeable, you can feel the scene's tone in the music.  I'd recommend this to anyone, but especially those who have a passion for flying.\n\nPositive thoughts aside, the English has some noticeable errors between translation and grammar, but they are usually too few to care about.","May 15, 2015","true","25.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Every single route tugged an entirely different heartstring, and none disappointed. If I had to rank the routes in order of how much I like them (which for me, is a Herculean task), it would be as follows:\n\n3-way tie for 1st: Kotori, Amane, and Asa\nStrong and close 2nd: Ageha\nLast but certainly not least: Yoru\n\nThe artwork is fantastically done and the music....is by far the strong point of the novel. Each emotional/touching moment is paired with a song, and these songs do an AMAZING job of evoking the right feelings for their respective scenes. You can check them out on Youtube...my favorite tracks are "A New World," "Morning Glory," and "My World."\n\nIn short, I HIGHLY recommend this game. It will make you laugh, and then it will tug at your emotions. If you like touching stories about high school kids finding love for each other and the sky, then go for it. I would even pay full $15 price for this, considering how much content I got out of it.\n\nI was on the fence about doing the whole Restoration patch to put the sex back into the game, but after playing through all routes I found that I didn't really need it to stay interested in the characters/story.\n\nOne final note: some of the translation can be a bit wonky at times, but it didn't take too much away from the story, and it didn't happen during the highly emotional parts. If you can look past that, then I would say pick this novel up. You won't regret it.\n\n9.5/10","May 5, 2015","true","53.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PresidentMoriarty/recommended/326480/","PresidentMoriarty","Happy Green Bisexual Trackstar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PresidentMoriarty/","157 products in account","The story of My Heart Had Wings is fairly engaging, even if it has the classic VN problems of being way too long and in dire need of editing down, and being full of annoying anime cliche nonsense. It also suffers from being really weak at first, with characters only becoming bearable hours into the story. However, the editing in this game is actually inexcusable.

This sounds extreme, but I mean it. The characters are very well done and actually lovable, the art quality is phenomenal and the voice acting is super well done (according to my Japanese friend)\nThere are negatives, so I'll state them right here: The translation job is bad at times. Typos are rare but happen enough to be consistent, and there was a character never shown on screen, whose gender was unkown, and the description kept popping from he to she to him to her, it was confusing.\nOh and obviously the game is censored to the extreme, because of Steam, but that's not really a negative, as this game is less hentai or even ecchi, and is more about the wonderful story and characters.\nPros? As said the characters are really easy to get attached to, the art is good, but what else? Well I can remember the soundtrack after I stop playing, so that's something.\nBut really, it's very long. Like, I mean, it takes 5 hours to get the THE INTRO MOVIE. Not only is it very very long, but it has multiple paths, so replay value is high especially with such well done girls (though some are more best than others, such as Kotori)\nAnd the game is really inspiring and uplifting to boot.\n\nI genuinely adore this VN, and would highly recommend it. One of the biggest pros of all, is it's on Steam, AND this good. It's a step in the right direction for Steam, after the several bad VNs that have been put on here. This along with Fault Milestone have changed my mind, and I welcome the genre.","May 9, 2015","true","11.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story is full of heart-touching emotion that leaves an effect on you.  My biggest complaint is that there is so much story, you cannot possibly just sit down and enjoy it all at once (unless you have no life, then by all means enjoy it from beginning to end!)  I have only completed one of the story arcs, and with I think five more to try, this story can keep me entertained for some time to come!   Even the music should have a special mention... it has a smooth melody that can easily slip into the background, but is can also be so noticeable, you can feel the scene's tone in the music.  I'd recommend this to anyone, but especially those who have a passion for flying.\n\nPositive thoughts aside, the English has some noticeable errors between translation and grammar, but they are usually too few to care about.","May 15, 2015","true","25.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Every single route tugged an entirely different heartstring, and none disappointed. If I had to rank the routes in order of how much I like them (which for me, is a Herculean task), it would be as follows:\n\n3-way tie for 1st: Kotori, Amane, and Asa\nStrong and close 2nd: Ageha\nLast but certainly not least: Yoru\n\nThe artwork is fantastically done and the music....is by far the strong point of the novel. Each emotional/touching moment is paired with a song, and these songs do an AMAZING job of evoking the right feelings for their respective scenes. You can check them out on Youtube...my favorite tracks are "A New World," "Morning Glory," and "My World."\n\nIn short, I HIGHLY recommend this game. It will make you laugh, and then it will tug at your emotions. If you like touching stories about high school kids finding love for each other and the sky, then go for it. I would even pay full $15 price for this, considering how much content I got out of it.\n\nI was on the fence about doing the whole Restoration patch to put the sex back into the game, but after playing through all routes I found that I didn't really need it to stay interested in the characters/story.\n\nOne final note: some of the translation can be a bit wonky at times, but it didn't take too much away from the story, and it didn't happen during the highly emotional parts. If you can look past that, then I would say pick this novel up. You won't regret it.\n\n9.5/10","May 5, 2015","true","53.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The only other issue is the localization, it seems off every so often, incorrect spelling, repeating words, etcetc, but if you can ignore that, it's extremely well done!\n\nAll in all, 9/10 so far for this, if the spelling and art was done slightly better it'd be a 100% 10/10.\n\nI will also edit this as I play more, to include all the other story lines.","May 9","true","23.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I also have read very few VNs and watched even fewer animes. So here's my review, beginning with the negative points: Aweful translation. I could've done a better job if I knew Japanese. The problem is in the Moenovel's understanding of English and western culture, I can guarantee it. People are talking about how Ageha's route is drastically changed. I wouldn't have minded that if not for the sloppy translation job. I am afraid that it is going to be like the translation, half-baked and full of inconsistencies. The introduction of clearly waaay underage Asa and Yoru as romancable characters freaked me out. I understand that there is an audience for it but cultural differences made it harder for me to continue. That's all the complaints I have with the novel. Everything else, like the plot, music, artwork and assets, is above average. The rough translation job might have butchered some of the cultural references and jokes but I wouldn't have got them anyway. I was specially impressed with the music and art style. The teams behind them are infinitely talented. I can't say much about voice acting as I'm totally Japanese-illiterate, but they did sound authentic and far from melodramatic or dull as with some VNs I've read before. Don't be fooled by typical anime cliches, the rest of it makes the VN so great that you won't even notice them. Go for it and take the soundtrack too, it's lovely.\n\nUpdate: I have installed the Restoration patch to see what's all the fuss behind it. And oh boy!!! Moenovel has totally butchered the game. It's not that it os bad, it is actually very good as far as the Kotori route goes but that is because the original Japanese material was exceptional, as proven by the restoration patch. Moenovel hasn't just cut the h-scenes which are frankly an important part of the Ageha arc according to many(which is why Moenovel rewrote it), but they also removed any kind of adult jokes and many important plot elements and CGs. The "Restored" version of the game feels like the GOTY edition of the Batman games. The translation job is still as sloppy as ever but a bit better than vanilla Moenovel release. If My Heart Had Wings was originally meany to be a young adult game which is suger-coated due to cultural barriers and taboo and stereotypes circulating japanese media. They should have made an official 18+ patch.","May 6","true","14.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's just horrible in my opinion. Many scenes go on for like 15 minutes or more, but with so little progress actually happening. Some conversations also felt much too repetetive.\nAfter about 3/4 of the common route I lost patience and had to skip the rest through. It didn't had the slightest bit of tension. I didn't even expect much drama, but basically almost NOTHING exciting happened at all.\nOn the positive side, the artwork is well done (most of the times) and the OP / ED songs are pretty catchy.

It feels like a first draft that was shipped as a complete project.  There are very many cases of the wrong pronoun being used or the wrong name being referenced as well as numerous cases where words are missing from sentences.  Also there is even one route where what is normally referred to as "the soaring club" is just "Soaring".  The whole script could use another editing pass but if you can work your way through these issues, I would recommend getting this only if it's on sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BronyDownUnder/recommended/326480/","BronyDownUnder","Brony Down Under™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BronyDownUnder/","146 products in account","I thought I'd just play this game casually but why not let it consume my soul instead?\n\nI got this game only recently with the Holiday sale and it took a big chunk out of my life after that. I got so wrapped up into the story I'd forget the time. I honestly didn't care much for dating simulators but this one is crafted well with it's beautiful art, character designs and story. It lives up to the "Visual Novel" selling point however this game is not perfect but is still rather engaging.\n\nStory (Intro):\nYou play as Aoi, who I learned to like as a character. Who's moved back to his hometown after a cycling accident. The intro to this game is pretty hefty, only after 7 hours did I make my first choice and there was good chunks of time between each choice. The main plot point is that you become a member / pilot of the "Soaring Club" and with Kotori, Ahega, Amane, Asa, Koru and other side characters that you strive for your goal in flying above the rare clouds of "Morning Glory". In doing so you must travel down one of six paths held before you and achieve this goal.\n\nThe order in which you take these paths can be of your choosing to some extent.\nKotori can be done on the first or second succesful try.\nAmane and Asa can be done anytime after Kotori.\nAhega can be done at anytime.\nAnd Yoru can only be done after Kotori and Asa.\nDepending on which girl you pick, the story can differ extremely. The first 6 hours before movie I (Act 1) unfold the same no matter what. Act 2 (Between movie I and II) is where 4 of your choices are made and Act 3 (Between movie II and III) is where (at most) two choices are made. After that you're just along for the ride.\n\nStory (Kotori):\nThis was the first route I completed and one I enjoyed the second most. It was also the longest to complete due to it being the first one I completed and took up 40% of the game (Including the common routes).\nThe things I enjoyed most of this storyline was The love confession in the new glider's test flight,  The way Aoi chased after Kotori on his bike even after his injury, When everyone got together and pulled the glider to get it airborne and using glowsticks, gide them to the winds. and finally The ending, where Kotori got surgery and began to walk again  which made me shed a single tear.\n\nStory (Amane):\nThis was my second completed route and easily my favourite. This was the easiest due to it having the least choices compared to the other routes. There was so much I loved about this route, like It's the only route that let's you keep the school garage until Act 4, The whole head in lap thing with Amane is ♥♥♥♥ing adorable, It's the only route which made me feel somewhat sorry for Mr. Tabioka with the letter and made me understand his actions, You learn everything about Isaka due to being so close with Amane and see Amane and Isaka in they're actual school years. Not to mention Isaka returns and is reunited with Amane and considering she's the girl on the title art and that she's half the reason the Soaring Club is still going is pretty damn awesome. And finally, An-Chan (My favourite side character) is in love with Isaka and because you chose Amane, you help him find his love for her again and you go on double dates and other cute ♥♥♥♥.\n\nStory (Ahega):\nThird completed, third favourite and easily the most frustrating and cheesy route. There's nothing overly wrong with this route it's just that Aoi jumps though so many ♥♥♥♥ing hoops for this girl compared to how easy it was to get Kotori or Amane. However the payoff made it pretty worth it with the moments before takeoff, Ahega just straight up grabs you and kisses you infront of everyone to prove a point,  you also get a damn sports car to pull your gilder airborne on a bridge and you have the best conversation with Ahega through the Radio after take off. Ahega is easily the worlds biggest tease and I enjoyed all of it.\n\nStory (Asa):\nFourth down and fourth favourite, there wasn't too much (at this point in the game) that really grabbed me about this route. Asa didn't get much screen time without her sister and after  breaking Yoru's heart to go for asa, I felt really bad and I couldn't find myself invested into the route. It's also the only route in which the real Morning Glory comes in that second summer however it shows up two years later but you don't see Asa and Yoru fly into it.\n\nStory (Yoru):\nLast up and least favourite for multiple reasons. The big one is that you never actually pick Yoru, you just say neither of them then she decides that you should date both of them which annoyed me because I (personally) liked Yoru more than I liked Asa (as a character). The only thing I did enjoy was when Asa was out of the picture and it was just you and Yoru.\n\nArt:\nFrom the previews above you can see the main art style of the story. Most of it is characters standing infront of a background with different poses and facial expressions but there are some beautifully drawn scenes, all of which are wallpaper worthy. There is also a chibi art style that's used to convey messages which I loved. It's also used for the acheivement "Too bad!".\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI played the vanilla version and didn't realise this was heavily censored, I might go back and install it to see the differences. I did still enjoy it however. The bad translating at points broke the immersion like the mixing up of pronouns (Tobioka was known as a she for a whole scene) and the mix up of names got me confused at times but all in all it was a fun 51 hours of my life.\n\n8.5/10 would 100% again.","January 4","true","51.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Unfortunatly for me I got nothing but 13 hours of aeronautical engineering and the bad ending. With a super long story and only about 5 choices depending on your conquest, I suggest that you should only get this game if you have a lot of time on your hands.\n\nHowever, I will say that the characters, writing (besides some translation issues), artwork, music and cutscenes are all fantastic and works well for the game. But with very little gameplay (making choices to progress) I stuggled to actually get into what I was doing (probably explains why I got the bad ending) and I felt bitter when I finished the game.\n\nIn conclusion, get this game if you want if you really want to. But if you would rather have something fulfilling I recomend Katawa Shoujo, a great game that is not only free but it is filled with wonderful characters and emotional routes (plus nudity without needing a patch which is a big bonus for some of you out there).

It all feels very tedious and when you accidentally miss a bit of dialogue, you end up just not caring because you are trying to make it all over as soon as possible\n- I am 4 hours into the game and I still feel like I know barely anything about the characters and it is all very predictable where everything is going\n- The basic format of this game is to tell and not show. With visual novels, I like to have the writer just assume that yes, I can see what is on the screen so no, I don't need every little thing described to me.\n- When we are introduced to one of the main characters at first, she is sweet, lovely and very likable. She quickly turns in to a complete pain in the ♥♥♥♥ with a bad attitude. I know we are supposed to feel sympathy for her because yes, she is disabled but I know a lot of disabled people who don't use it as an excuse to be a total ♥♥♥♥ to everyone.\n\nAs I said, 3/10 - I have tried with this game.

VN lovers, I highly recommend if you haven't tried this. This game has multiple routes and choices. Similiar to Hirameki's style of choice choosing for games however the CG and story with VA provide more than enough. Good game, you'll find a good moment of appreciation to the characters and the story. The art is entertaining same with some lines. However there are tense moments. I find this game a 9/10. It really does take up your time but I've played this before it came here. So yeah give it a try. Especially if on discount, these things can cost up to 20 maybe more usually. So I do recommend find a cheaper price, take it. This game after 2 years still has it's impressions that just take me back. The only cgs missing are from the fandisc and the H-scenes. Still for the matter of audience, it had to be appropriated. Still mine has the reason of playing it before. Just now it's like Hirameki with Hourglass of Summer.

I bought it knowing that it has romance in it since I sincerely love romance a lot. Once I've settled on the game, it was amazingly good because I didn't expect it to have so many kissing scenes- Which are my favourite, of course. Not only it has kiss scenes but what do you know; it's harem as well!\n\nWell created game and plots. One of the best things I love in this game, is the art. The art met over my expectations! Plot, it was well planned out. Harem routes were plotted out greatly. Romance sequels were best. You wouldn't expect what comes out next in the scene.\n\nNo ignorance were given to this game because, well, I couldn't even feint an ignorance to it.

There's a misconception about Japan eroge that it all must "hentai an pervertedness beyond recognition," but this isn't what it fantasizes.\n\nThe Experience: 4/5\nFinally finished the epilogue and the first route of many (Took 20ish hours). I played some parts with and without the restoration patch and I have to say they're both are pretty well made with some little english translation errors. In all honesty, without the patch you still get the beautiful narrative and story of the characters. The patch only enhances the experience with deeper character developments. Having played the highly prominent VN Majikoi (80+ Hours), I found this one very enjoyable so far going through one route. Its basically a Slice of Life anime and has a very tranquil atmosphere that I can't express in any regard.\n\nStory: 4/5\nThe epilogue was really well done and was longer than I thought it woud be which is good thing. It set up the atmosphere and characters very well for when you choose your path. There wasn't a point in the tory that I felt wasn't needed, but there were some parts where I skimmed over. I did the Kotori Route first and man did it bring the emotions. I hope to see that more as I go onto the next route. Overall so far, its very bright and a feel inducing rollercoaster that you won't forget.\n\nGraphics/Art: 5/5\nEach time you see the sky CGI you could almost feel the breeze. Believe me, you will get absorbed in this game whether you like it or not. The CGI animation with the windmills look fantastic and the glider itself looks awesome along with combination with the wonderfully painted backgrounds, its eye candy.\nhttp://imgur.com/c8FcHWV\n\nAudio/Soundtrack: 5/5\nThe sound track fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the novel and potrays it very well. Its probably one of the best I've heard, then again I've only played 3 VN including this one. Its very soothing and has a vibrant touch to it that makes it upbeat at times.

The visuals were picturesque and the BGM beautifully complemented many of the scenes.  The game's only weakness, which is also its greatest strength, was that the game has far too much written work without there being any kind of routes opening up until the second act.  However, because there is a grand amount of detail with how the routes moves forth with the story, people can begin to feel truly invested with the choices they had made. I, overall, was given my money's worth and then some.

From my understanding, this happened during the censoring of the game for the steam version, and if you use the official "restoration patch" to restore the game to it's original AO (with sex scenes) version, it fixes the bad translation, so I would recommend doing that if you're of the legal age to do such things.","February 12, 2015","true","42.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a diverse array of characters that makes replays feel less like "alternate endings" and more like "alternate universes" kind of like fate/stay night (IMHO). I really liked how heroines that you dont choose dont just fade into obscurity, or (worse) suddenly dissapear, leaving readers to go "what was that person for anyway?" on any single playthru. It makes it feel like the game is less about "the life and choices of protagonist X" and more about "the Soaring Club". That said, I dont mean that the routes are as drastically different as they are in Fate/Stay Night; they are _distinct_ but not as jarringly different as routes in F/SN are.\n\nThere are less "choices" (i.e. branch points) than i expected, which was actually kind of nice, it made me feel like i could more sit back and read the story and get immersed in it rather than constantly have to figure out which choice raised the flags for the heroine i was aiming for. Some people will undoubtedly find that this makes the game more linear and feel like they have less control over the protagonist, more of a story, less of a dating sim.\n\nThat said: I played the "limited edition" version on tablet first, found the "collect wings" thing to be BS since it took so long,  breaking the story into chunks that were too short for the amount of time you had to wait in between each chunk to even get a feel for the story (i played for 10 min, and then ran out of wings, then spend 3 weeks mining for wings, once a day, every day and then played one long chunck, which got me... maybe 25% into a single play thru? maybe.\n\nSoon the steam version went on sale and i said "screw this imma play it on PC, even though i was also thinking "this is exactlty the kind of game i want to play on the bus or during lunch, on my tablet T_T ). The steam version... its... its good, but every so often, you hit a section where you just KNOW something is wrong. The context suggests one thing and the dialogue says something... different... I _GET_ that its because the edited the lines to make it an all-ages version and that what was edited was deemed "too suggestive" or "innapropriate for younger audiences" but for me, i found it incredibly jarring and immersion-breaking. I dont know if its possible to edit things to the point where its not jarring, but well... when a character is obviously talking about breasts (from context) but the dialog is suddenly about "big eyes"... its well.. it feels like driving down a straight road and having someone suddenly pull the e-brake for a sec, and then look at you like "what? why are you looking at me all wierd for?" this was exacerbated by the fact that i know enough japanese to KNOW that the character says "breasts" not "eyes"....\n\nI tried to apply the "restoration patch" to the game, and... somehow i ended up with no vioce acting? Not sure. Im trying to fix it now, but not even a "clean reinstall" seems to work. theres probably some file left over that im not finding to delete and its causing errors. Some places have said the restoration patch does not fix the dialog, and only adds the sex-scenes back in, and it might wreck the CG and the scene replays, but... i want my voice acting first, so i havent gotten to the point where i check that stuff yet.\n\nStill: 8/10. would buy again.\n\nwould be really nice if i could play it on table tho....

The score is also somewhat based off my opinion, but even though I have cons agaisnt it I STRONGLY reccomend picking this VN up.\n\nIMHHW is a visual novel that follows the life of a boy name Aoi after returning to his old home town. He mets some old friends and makes some new ones after being given the position of a dorm mother at an all girls off campus house. Throughout the game you make several choices which impact which path you take, as well as alter the ending.\n\nThis was my first visual novel after reading Katawa Shoujo. In all honesty I have mixed feelings about it. The introduction and mid-story was very pleasing and kept my interested, but the late-story and ending kind of left me hanging (more so than Katawa Shoujo). I personally don't like open endings because I want to see how things truely ended, but it might appeal to some people.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing, the voice overs add a nice touch, animated cutscenes and images added in to really expand on certain scenes 100% made the game that much more enjoyable.\n\nAll in all I'd give it a 8/10, and again the only reason I'm not giving it a higher score is because of my personal opinion on the ending.","March 7, 2015","true","34.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personally don't feel the need for a hentai-packed eroge full of ♥♥♥ shots and sex scenes, but some of the romance is dulled by the fact that even when they allude to mature material, none of it is ever directly addressed. There's no adult content and it's a bit sad because once you've become attatched to the characters, your choices, and the natural flow of the storyline, a little bit of mature material adds to the delightful romance you've set in motion.\n\nI personally don't understand how to replace my game with the Restoration Patch, which is disappointing for me because I'd like to find out what exactly I've missed out on.

This is without a doubt the game's strongest point. The various climaxes of the game, when the action really came together for the Soaring Club to do something amazing, never failed to give me chills and inspire a big emotional response.\n- Visuals: the sprites especially are very high-resolution, well-drawn, and unique. I'm admittedly not that knowledgeable about visual novels, but I haven't previously seen one that does varied zoom levels for the character sprites. This game gets a lot of mileage out of that technique, and the sprites always look good while they play these tricks with them. Backgrounds and movies are also great, but the care taken with fine details of the character sprites really steals the show.\n- Character design: I find the characters to be varied and interesting, especially the first 3 heroines (I maybe didn't get enough time with the two who appear later to feel much connection with them; maybe this will change when I play their routes, though). The heroines have very distinct, personalities, and are also very independent; they don't depend on their relationship with the main character to define themselves (a common  problem in visual novels, IMO). Admittedly, the heroines all fall into pretty common visual novel tropes, but I don't really view this as a negative so much as an inevitability.\n\nNegatives:\n- Translation: The translation for the common route is actually great. I noticed very few odd turns of phrasing, and very few grammatical and spelling mistakes, and only one translation that was simply bizarrely wrong (the repeated appearance of a phrase like "Then, on the first day of summer", when it was clearly inappropriate and clearly didn't match the vocals).\nThat said, the translation for the one character route I have so far played (Kotori's route) was frankly appalling: about half of it suffered from one of:\n- very poor English (dialogue that would certainly not have been spoken by a native speaker)\n- out of character (wording did not fit for the character)\n- nonsensical in context (perhaps a single sentence was translated independent of everything around it, or without the context of the visuals and voice acting? At any rate, it was sometimes clearly wrong, even with my poor grasp of spoken Japanese)\n- incorrect translation, or failing to correctly capture the mood/emotion of the context (again, even with my poor grasp of spoken Japanese this was very obvious at times)\n\nI would recommend the game as an excellent visual novel, with the caveat that you have to be willing to bear with a terrible translation awaiting you at the end of the game, where the most emotional scenes await. I found that frankly very disappointing, after the earlier parts of the game were so much better-done. I'm holding out hope that it was just the particular route I chose that was terribly translated, and that others will be better when I go back to play through them... One odd thing I noticed was that it was perhaps the first 2/3 of the character route that were especially poorly-translated; the last 1/3 of it was back on track and reasonable. I can't really say whether the problem is going to be so prevalent in other character routes.","January 25, 2015","true","58.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not because they're not fun, but because it takes a very skilled writer to make one that's worth getting invested in. Yypically those writers stick to writing books because it's far simpler to find a book publisher than it is a team of artists and programmers all working to help make your dream come to life.\nThis one stands out from the others, however.\nThe amount of effort put into it to make it immersive, interesting, visually appealing and about anything else you could want is unreal. I'll take it one step at a time.\n\nVisuals - They're more important in this genre than in any other, in my opinion. Stories can be compelling and addicting on their own, but if you're going to throw in artwork, you have to do it well. Otherwise, you end up getting distracted from the story by the game's shortcomings.\nThe visuals are amazingly done. Hell, the pictures above do better justice than my words. And those aren't edited just to look better or pickings from some concept art, the entire game looks like that, The art style is very consistant and honestly it makes the world the game presents feel even more real.\n\nAudio - I actually didn't expect this game to have full voice acting. That's a huge task, but it's done, at least in Japanese. It seriously helps add to the emotions of everything and while in some visual novels I find myself quickly skipping through text just to get through; in this game I find myself replaying some lines of dialog just to hear them again. I don't speak the language, but the acting is very good. Good enough to make me wait until they've finished speaking to click.\nThe music is just as impressive, and I've actually been listening to the soundtrack outside of the game. Although I have no connection to this music, some of the songs seriously bring up feelings of nostalgia for me. Perhaps it's just the way they sound, or maybe I'm connecting them to something without knowing. All I know is that the music adds so much to the emotion of scenes that I can't help but get teary-eyed at times.\n\nStory - You be noticing me using the word "emotion" a lot in this and there's a reason. Emotion is something this game has that very few games ever have for me. You get so invested into the characters, knowing their names, their likes and dislikes, sometimes even knowing exactly how they'll react to something. I find myself verbally responding to many things they say even though there's nobody listening and reacting emotionally just as often.\nIt's lengthy for sure, and has plenty of choices, but that only makes it better to me.\n\nThis is the first game that has made me feel nostalgic towards time I spent with the characters since I got Kingdom Hearts the Christmas it came out. Most of the time when I play games I want to get 100% completion and I'm always thinking about how I could best do it or I'm just killing time, but not this one. When I play this game, I feel like I'm holding a work of art in my hands. Something that someone else has so carefully crafted to give that exact feelings, to work it's way into your heart the way some  other form of story has done at some point in your life. For me, it was Kingdom Hearts, then V for Vendetta, and now this.\n\nEven the very rare bits of perversion, something that usually turns me away from taking a game seriously, fits in shockingly well with the story. It adds a rather odd type of humor and charm that I really can't explain\n\nI will never forget the story this game has told me. Even though at the time of writing this I only have about 12 hours invested into it, I can tell you that I know I won't. I'm keeping a very close eye on MoeNovel; though I'm not sure they could craft something this significant to me again, this game has shown their interest in quality and their level of skill.\n\nAs for this game, buy it. It would worth it at $60 just as it is at $18. And yes, get the soundtrack too, even if for no other reason then showing them support. This game should be held up as a shining example that video games can be art, along with others such as D:AET. I want to see games taken in a better direction with something such as this leading the way; not down the road of only visual novel games, but down the road of games aspiring to make a permanent mark on you rather than most of the ♥♥♥♥ you get on the Steam storefront these days.","November 7, 2015","true","62.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once I've settled on the game, it was amazingly good because I didn't expect it to have so many kissing scenes- Which are my favourite, of course. Not only it has kiss scenes but what do you know; it's harem as well!\n\nWell created game and plots. One of the best things I love in this game, is the art. The art met over my expectations! Plot, it was well planned out. Harem routes were plotted out greatly. Romance sequels were best. You wouldn't expect what comes out next in the scene.\n\nNo ignorance were given to this game because, well, I couldn't even feint an ignorance to it. All I could ever say is to thank the creators for deploying such a wonderful game in the Steam store!\n\nI'm a huge fan of romance and this game absolutely, didn't let me down.","February 7, 2015","true","44.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a misconception about Japan eroge that it all must "hentai an pervertedness beyond recognition," but this isn't what it fantasizes.\n\nThe Experience: 4/5\nFinally finished the epilogue and the first route of many (Took 20ish hours). I played some parts with and without the restoration patch and I have to say they're both are pretty well made with some little english translation errors. In all honesty, without the patch you still get the beautiful narrative and story of the characters. The patch only enhances the experience with deeper character developments. Having played the highly prominent VN Majikoi (80+ Hours), I found this one very enjoyable so far going through one route. Its basically a Slice of Life anime and has a very tranquil atmosphere that I can't express in any regard.\n\nStory: 4/5\nThe epilogue was really well done and was longer than I thought it woud be which is good thing. It set up the atmosphere and characters very well for when you choose your path. There wasn't a point in the tory that I felt wasn't needed, but there were some parts where I skimmed over. I did the Kotori Route first and man did it bring the emotions. I hope to see that more as I go onto the next route. Overall so far, its very bright and a feel inducing rollercoaster that you won't forget.\n\nGraphics/Art: 5/5\nEach time you see the sky CGI you could almost feel the breeze. Believe me, you will get absorbed in this game whether you like it or not. The CGI animation with the windmills look fantastic and the glider itself looks awesome along with combination with the wonderfully painted backgrounds, its eye candy.\nhttp://imgur.com/c8FcHWV\n\nAudio/Soundtrack: 5/5\nThe sound track fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the novel and potrays it very well. Its probably one of the best I've heard, then again I've only played 3 VN including this one. Its very soothing and has a vibrant touch to it that makes it upbeat at times. Opening is the best!","December 13, 2014","true","89.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got this game a while back before it went on sale but when I saw it on sale I thought I should write a review about it. This game gave me a massive appreciation of the skies beauty and impossible desire to fly a plane. The story was longe and really interesting, I only felt a dull moment once or twice before things became interesting or fun. All of the characters are voiced. The game also has this concept where you must play a certain girls route before playing another's, such as you must complete Kotori's route before playing Amane's, which I do not have a problem with since it is the first time I have seen something like this in a visual novel. The characters are all very interesting and their back stories made me care for them, Kotori the grumpy disabled girl, Ageha the childhood friend, Asa the happy twin, Yoru the protective twin, and then Amane, the dedicated airhead. The story is 30-40 hours long, I recommend you look up the VNDB (Visual novel database) entry of the game for more details on the characters and situation. Yes, there is also a restoration back which ads quite a bit more content, so I recommend you get that if you want the complete game. And that's the best I can describe since I don't often write reviews, but purchase this game, it is really fun you will love it!\n\n\nAmane is best girl.","June 15, 2015","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Clannad has more routes but IMHHW (if my heart had wings) seems more.... in depth. You learn so much more about each character and go further into the past with them.\nTo be honost i have not completed either, but this is my generam feel.\n\ni say. Buy this.

A review for Kono Oozora ni Tsubasa wo Hirogete/If My Heart Had Wings.\nFor people new to this sort of game genre, this is a Visual Novel. That means it's text-heavy and is basically like reading a book except there's drawings of landscapes, cute girls, some clouds or something, with added voice-acting and a pretty good soundtrack.\n\nIf My Heart Had Wings is a visual novel about Minase Aoi, a dude who was in a bicycle race accident, after which he transfers to a school in his old hometown and meets old friends, new friends, and a glider which changes his life for the better.\n\nWithout going into further detail, it's actually a REALLY GOOD visual novel. I'd even say it's better than Katawa Shoujo, but that's my personal opinion (pls don't flame me). The characters are really interesting, the voice acting is SUPERB, and the soundtrack is just a pleasure to listen to. The interface for the game is relatively simple and shouldn't be too hard to navigate. (no, really. i mean you just keep clicking anyway)\n\nWhat about bad points?\n\nIf you're wondering why I'm not talking about the storyline, it's because of MoeNovel. The translation of MoeNovel removes some vital "plot points" which makes certain routes in the game not make a lot of sense. However, if you do get the restoration patch, the translation turns out better and all plot is returned to normal. (or if you're just looking for some lewd bits, go on ahead. story's still pretty damn good tho.)\n\nIn short:\nIMHHW is an amazing visual novel, if you include the patch. If you can get it on sale, highly recommended.\nIf you're also looking for a good story-based experience but don't want to read a book, this is the game for you.\n[even though it's pretty much a book]\nVerdict: Solid 8.8/10. This is an amazing game. Get it.\nAlso: Duck wearing a hat as a supporting character. Pretty good feature if you ask me.\nPS. kotori best girl fite me","February 8, 2015","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The premice is pretty unique, it's about a Glider club and the life of those characters, particularly Kotori who is essentially the 'main' non-player character. Art and sound quality are both very good in my opinion, there's even some animated cutscenes, but it's largely all still art shots which of course you can collect.\n\nThe downside is this is the steam version and is missing out significant content because it is 18+ but you are able to patch it in.

A review for Kono Oozora ni Tsubasa wo Hirogete/If My Heart Had Wings.\nFor people new to this sort of game genre, this is a Visual Novel. That means it's text-heavy and is basically like reading a book except there's drawings of landscapes, cute girls, some clouds or something, with added voice-acting and a pretty good soundtrack.\n\nIf My Heart Had Wings is a visual novel about Minase Aoi, a dude who was in a bicycle race accident, after which he transfers to a school in his old hometown and meets old friends, new friends, and a glider which changes his life for the better.\n\nWithout going into further detail, it's actually a REALLY GOOD visual novel. I'd even say it's better than Katawa Shoujo, but that's my personal opinion (pls don't flame me). The characters are really interesting, the voice acting is SUPERB, and the soundtrack is just a pleasure to listen to. The interface for the game is relatively simple and shouldn't be too hard to navigate. (no, really. i mean you just keep clicking anyway)\n\nWhat about bad points?\n\nIf you're wondering why I'm not talking about the storyline, it's because of MoeNovel. The translation of MoeNovel removes some vital "plot points" which makes certain routes in the game not make a lot of sense. However, if you do get the restoration patch, the translation turns out better and all plot is returned to normal. (or if you're just looking for some lewd bits, go on ahead. story's still pretty damn good tho.)\n\nIn short:\nIMHHW is an amazing visual novel, if you include the patch. If you can get it on sale, highly recommended.\nIf you're also looking for a good story-based experience but don't want to read a book, this is the game for you.\n[even though it's pretty much a book]\nVerdict: Solid 8.8/10. This is an amazing game. Get it.\nAlso: Duck wearing a hat as a supporting character. Pretty good feature if you ask me.\nPS. kotori best girl fite me","February 8, 2015","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story (slow at times) always sped up at the end of a route and left me with a feeling of peace (contentment combined with pleasure), every time. Also, do the restoration patch.\n\nFor me:\nAgeha: Personal Favorite route, cutest route\nAmane: Best route, deepest route\nKotori: The route that would get an anime adaption, touching route\nTwin route: For the harem fans\nAsa route: The Inspiring route\n\n10/10 Will patch for the H","June 7, 2015","true","133.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it knowing that it has romance in it since I sincerely love romance a lot. Once I've settled on the game, it was amazingly good because I didn't expect it to have so many kissing scenes- Which are my favourite, of course. Not only it has kiss scenes but what do you know; it's harem as well!\n\nWell created game and plots. One of the best things I love in this game, is the art. The art met over my expectations! Plot, it was well planned out. Harem routes were plotted out greatly. Romance sequels were best. You wouldn't expect what comes out next in the scene.\n\nNo ignorance were given to this game because, well, I couldn't even feint an ignorance to it.

The visuals, the music, the characters and the story always have me coming back for more. The story, spoiler free, is that of Aoi (lol girl's name) returning to his hometown to find that many things have changed. He takes on a job as the caretaker of an all female dorm and [skipping a bit] gets sexy with lots of waifu material.\n\nI can't say it's my favorite romance story of all time, as the story in each of the 5 routes tends to focus a lot on the state of the glider and everyone's shared dream of reconstructing and flying above a rare natural phenomenon. There's just enough romance to call it a romance game, and yet the relationships seem more real for the fact that it's a by-product of coming together with a shared goal in mind. It doesn't deal with any social issues, nor does it strive to leave some deep message ingrained in your subconscious that is intended to change your life somehow. It's just pure, fun storytelling.\n\nI'm aware of some issues using the (highly recommended) restoration patch on Win8, but it's been solved on Win10.\n\nPROS\n-LONG, can spend upwards of 15 hours per route if you listen to all the audio\n-Visuals are (mostly) top notch\n-Soundtrack (buy it)\n-It's a feel-good novel. Minimal tragedy, happy endings\n-Duck with tophat\n-Tsunderes\n-Sexy times, if you download the patch.\n-FREQUENTLY ON SALE, Sometimes up to 60% off\n-Did I mention the loli twins? (yes, it totally happens)\n\nCONS\n-Some minor disply issues with non-background images and motion, relics left (got cockblocked by Hat on my first playthrough, was on screen for 2 different... "encounters")\n-Not much focus on romance, more about Soaring Club narrative\n-Bunch of censored, unintelligble Engrish bull spit in the vanilla\n-You can't buy it twice\n\nIn conclusion. the visuals and soundtrack are 10/10, the story is 9/10. This game has me coming back for more every few months, and I wouldn't want it any other way.  Download this if you call yourself a VN fan: you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll have a lot of spare tissues in the trash can, you'll get a warm fuzzy feeling.

It's literal garbage. There are way too many things wrong with it. First off there are about 4 songs that play constantly throughout the entire novel. They get redundent and annoying. There are COUNTLESS condinuity errors ranging from the setting being summer vacation, but having the students still go to school and attend classes to a character carrying an umbrella, but still manages to get wet from rain. Mistranslations aside, there are MANY careless grammatical errors. These include using "your" instead of you're", or saying "a umbrella" opposed to "an umbrella", and there are times when a letter JUST FLAT OUT HASN'T BEEN TYPED, example being "ever" instead of "never". At one point, the word "this" was typed instead of the word "us". These are only a small sample compared to the grammatical mess this novel is written in, proving that this novel without a doubt has NOT been proofread. The story can be summed up in one word: TEDIOUS!!! Over 30 hours of long, drawn out conversations that hold no value whatsoever. There are some scenes that are pretty intriguing, but only last 2 minutes and are 3 hours apart. Leaving you impatiently spam clicking through a garbage truck to reach the next scene that's worth a damn. The choices hold abysmal impact and are exceptionally infrequent for a VN. What I can say is that the artwork, for both the characters and environments, is phenomenal. But to me, it's a waste of talent since the story is so poor. The notorious Moenovel has been accused of butchering scenes to make it kid friendly, I wonder what other company is exactly the same *Cough*4KIDS*Cough*. But there are times when a scene becomes completely incoherent due to censorship. At one point the narration claims Aoi to be "Lost in her eyes", but the scene is a close up of her chest, she proceeds to be offended. This burdens much confusion and awkwardness to the reader, which is not good at all. The ending, I must say, Is done quite well, in relativity to the rest of the novel, which trust me, isn't much of a compliment. But it's NOT AT ALL worth the 30 treacherous hours to reach it. That's only for one arc! To 100% the VN, you need to beat it 5 TIMES! I can't even imagine the most masochistic, self-hating, imbecile attempting such an idiotic feat, considering only one with the masochism level such as I would even dare to attempt to complete the VN ONCE! Mining & Tunneling Sim was a better use of my time and money. I have much more to say about this, but this is beginning to drag out, so I'll end it with a final elaboration of the novel's contents:\n\nTL;DR","August 29, 2015","false","32.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's just so much story, my playtime exceeded 40 hours because the story changes significantly with different choices. So it's not like you'll be done in 4 hours, you get your money's worth. The premice is pretty unique, it's about a Glider club and the life of those characters, particularly Kotori who is essentially the 'main' non-player character. Art and sound quality are both very good in my opinion, there's even some animated cutscenes, but it's largely all still art shots which of course you can collect.\n\nThe downside is this is the steam version and is missing out significant content because it is 18+ but you are able to patch it in. I also had a few problems with some picture panels freezing for a long time and they end up obscuring the game, that was a bit annoying. Other than that though, very enjoyable.","August 31, 2015","true","44.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not because they're not fun, but because it takes a very skilled writer to make one that's worth getting invested in. Yypically those writers stick to writing books because it's far simpler to find a book publisher than it is a team of artists and programmers all working to help make your dream come to life.\nThis one stands out from the others, however.\nThe amount of effort put into it to make it immersive, interesting, visually appealing and about anything else you could want is unreal. I'll take it one step at a time.\n\nVisuals - They're more important in this genre than in any other, in my opinion. Stories can be compelling and addicting on their own, but if you're going to throw in artwork, you have to do it well. Otherwise, you end up getting distracted from the story by the game's shortcomings.\nThe visuals are amazingly done. Hell, the pictures above do better justice than my words. And those aren't edited just to look better or pickings from some concept art, the entire game looks like that, The art style is very consistant and honestly it makes the world the game presents feel even more real.\n\nAudio - I actually didn't expect this game to have full voice acting. That's a huge task, but it's done, at least in Japanese. It seriously helps add to the emotions of everything and while in some visual novels I find myself quickly skipping through text just to get through; in this game I find myself replaying some lines of dialog just to hear them again. I don't speak the language, but the acting is very good. Good enough to make me wait until they've finished speaking to click.\nThe music is just as impressive, and I've actually been listening to the soundtrack outside of the game. Although I have no connection to this music, some of the songs seriously bring up feelings of nostalgia for me. Perhaps it's just the way they sound, or maybe I'm connecting them to something without knowing. All I know is that the music adds so much to the emotion of scenes that I can't help but get teary-eyed at times.\n\nStory - You be noticing me using the word "emotion" a lot in this and there's a reason. Emotion is something this game has that very few games ever have for me. You get so invested into the characters, knowing their names, their likes and dislikes, sometimes even knowing exactly how they'll react to something. I find myself verbally responding to many things they say even though there's nobody listening and reacting emotionally just as often.\nIt's lengthy for sure, and has plenty of choices, but that only makes it better to me.\n\nThis is the first game that has made me feel nostalgic towards time I spent with the characters since I got Kingdom Hearts the Christmas it came out. Most of the time when I play games I want to get 100% completion and I'm always thinking about how I could best do it or I'm just killing time, but not this one. When I play this game, I feel like I'm holding a work of art in my hands. Something that someone else has so carefully crafted to give that exact feelings, to work it's way into your heart the way some  other form of story has done at some point in your life. For me, it was Kingdom Hearts, then V for Vendetta, and now this.\n\nEven the very rare bits of perversion, something that usually turns me away from taking a game seriously, fits in shockingly well with the story. It adds a rather odd type of humor and charm that I really can't explain\n\nI will never forget the story this game has told me. Even though at the time of writing this I only have about 12 hours invested into it, I can tell you that I know I won't. I'm keeping a very close eye on MoeNovel; though I'm not sure they could craft something this significant to me again, this game has shown their interest in quality and their level of skill.\n\nAs for this game, buy it. It would worth it at $60 just as it is at $18. And yes, get the soundtrack too, even if for no other reason then showing them support. This game should be held up as a shining example that video games can be art, along with others such as D:AET. I want to see games taken in a better direction with something such as this leading the way; not down the road of only visual novel games, but down the road of games aspiring to make a permanent mark on you rather than most of the ♥♥♥♥ you get on the Steam storefront these days.","November 7, 2015","true","62.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're going to invest time in this I must recommend installing the restoration patch nad the sweet love UI. (Kotori best girl BTW)\n\nTears were shed and feels were felt throughtout all of the routes (Thank the lord for the restoration patch.) Without the restoration patch the novel is a complete mess and time shouldn't be invested in it the translations were off a lot of the times and the grammar and spelling, oh god, Moenovel's english was more engrish; it was a chore to figure out what they were trying to say. (I'm looking at you redone Ageha route)\n\nHowever, I must commend Moenovel for trying to bring Visual novels to the west to enjoy and hopefully this will be start of more Visual novels being traslated in english for the world to enjoy.\n\nMusic in this was top notch everything felt in place. The BGM allowed you to read the text easily and peacefully and the music really set the tone for serious and less serious scenes. All the main characters were all developed very well in their respective routes and made you really care for them. Their development made them seem extreamly realistic once you get further and further into their routes. The art was really, really good! I was really suprised everyone had unique designs and the detail for backgorund art was really extraordinary. The facial expressions for each character really fitted their personalities well and the huge variety of expressions made it so it was fresh to look at hem even though you seen them before.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend the Moenovel version, however the restored version is something to be marveled at. A heart moving tale that drags you deeper and deeper to care for the characters and make you realise once you finished a route how lonely you actaully are. ;_;\n\nNo waifu, no laifu. If you don't feel your heart churning at least once while reading this visual novel you're probably doing it wrong.","August 26, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't just say "Yay" or "Nay" to a product. In many ways, I love this visual novel. The characters to me are charming and very well done, and although I haven't made it through all the way through the game(which I will get to later), I enjoy the plot so far. To the negative points, the visual novel is censored to kingdom come. Now, believe me when I say I'm not just some 12 year old boy looking to get his rocks off, I just prefer to experience something as it was originally made. So, before I even began going through the visual novel, I downloaded the Restoration Patch and Sweet Love UI. Come to find out, it was buggy and I was still missing out on a really crucial part of the game which is seeing the characters in the foreground. All I saw was a background of the setting and a text box, and me not knowing any better went with it like it was a normal book and just played the scenes out in my head. About ~10 hours through, I knew something was up because I had to choose who's outfit looked best, and I couldn't even see the outfits. You can imagine my frustration with having to scour Google and forum websites, and even message a fellow reviewer of this visual novel to hopefully find a fix.\n\ntl;dr: Don't get the game unless you're a sap for love stories like me and don't mind censoring/ willing to go through literal hell to undo the censoring.\n\nEDIT: After running through the game on Kotori's story, I do say that this game wasn't bad afterall. The censoring and poor translation may've put a bad taste in my mouth, but the fact that I teared up to something in Kotori's story really means something. I'll revise my recommendation to a 'yes'.","August 22, 2015","true","28.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Obviously some of the routes are better written than others (looking at you, whoever translated Ageha's route) but my personal favourite was Kotori's route closely followed by Amane's. Every single character in the main cast has had some sort of significant loss in their past, perhaps even traumatic. And seeing as the main character has had a rather hefty loss himself, Aoi is able to connect on a very strong level with each and every one of these girls. But, for all you people who just got very excited; no, there is no harem ending. Anyway, as the story goes on you encounter more hardships and emotions are evoked several times along the way as the reader. Emotionally evoking stories are often a good read in my opinion.\n\nThe music is good in this game, but nothing to write home about. You will probably think of it as really good after you've completed the stories but then after a while you realise that you only feel that way because you're being reminded of certain scenes and dialogues that you liked in the story. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but to repeat myself, the music isn't top notch, but visual novels aren't about the music.\n\nThe characters themselves are horrifically stereotypical. The moody handicapped person, the childhood friend, the mysterious senpai, the ditsy twin and the intelligent twin, however; they manage to make it all work. These characters, despite all conforming to stereotpyes actually work and you do get easily emotionally attached to them through the stories.\n\nThe artwork is nice, but again, nothing to write home about. Combined with the music there is a nice atmosphere in the game.\n\nThere are a number of decisions to make over the course of this long story which is important to some people. I couldn't care less.\n\nOverall, fantastic story, really good characters despite all being stereotypical, decent artwork and music but nothing spectacular about either - a very good visual novel which is going to be retranslated. Hopefully this time around large chunks of Ageha's route aren't an incomprensible mess.","March 12","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll smile, laugh, cringe and cry. It's all here.\n\nNow there's one problem, without patches and fixes, some of the lines are missing and some translations are not good.\n\nI still recommend this game to any one who has a decent amount of spare time and loves a good visual novel. 10/10","January 15","true","42.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tarvok/recommended/326480/","tarvok","tarvok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tarvok/","18 products in account","EDIT: I have played a bit of the Steam configuration of the game, and I have decided that I cannot recommend the game in its current state. The review below assumes you have fully modded the game with the restoration patch. This review, and the unrecommendation, assume the game as Steam installs it. I cannot recommend a game that requires modding to be decent.\n\nThe censoring is not the issue. I don't really have a problem of the removal of the sex scenes. I have read that some of the story is butchered a bit to avoid such scenes, but I haven't actually reached that point. I don't need to, to update this review.\n\nThe problem is the translation. It isn't as halting and awkward as I was lead to believe (though I'm only a few days into the game at this point), but there are some truly glaring errors in the translation.\n\nThe worst example is the use of the word "grade" where they ought to be using the word "year". For instance, there is a part where the main character and his friend are discussing the awesome time the main character took third in a bicycle race when he was in "first grade". I'm a great big weeaboo, so I know what they were trying to say: his first year at that school (likely fourteen or fifteen years old). But it just brings to mind the sight of a teenage guy still proud about how his athletic career peaked at six years of age.\n\nThen there's the girl at the dorm, who is apparently the oldest one there. She's in fourth grade, apparently. (I swear, officer, she didn't look that young!) Of course, that means she's in her fourth year of this specialist high school (most Japanese high schools only go three years). Severely problematic for someone who's not already deep in the fan community.\n\nA lesser issue I'd like MoeNovel to revisit is the attempt to translate "sempai" and "kohai". This translation uses the word "senior" and "junior", respectively, in contexts that would suggest to an American reader that they are in their third and fourth year at the school, when it reality it just means one is older than the other. Current practice is to leave those words untranslated (as they have no English equivalent), and just trust that the information is readily availble, because it is.\n\nFinally, most of the reviews it will complain to the swallowtail route. When I wrote the part of before that, I'm for about playing in the middle of the Asaruto, and the translation was not great. But I have to play the final in the Ageha route, someone, translated into Japan took the English Google again, is the it through to it ran Such translated it I feel. Japanese, and back again.\n\nThus, I cannot recommend the game in its current state. But if you want to play it, read the review below, and then look for installation instructions for the Restoration Patch.\n\nIt took me a while to decide whether or not I was going to recommend this game. On the one hand, the story was fun and rewarding. On the other hand, it isn't "gamelike" enough. Just before this one, I played Clannad; this is no Clannad.\n\nTo be honest, this would, in my opinion, make a better manga than visual novel. There are a few places where the soundtrack and visual effects add to the experience, but for the most part, the entire story could be conveyed well through images on a page. The alternate stories are few enough, and the choices needed to choose between those stories few enough, that simply releasing an alternate story in another volume would work.\n\nThat said, it was a great story, and given that I got it for $4.94 (on sale as of this writing), the only real expense was the time. Visual novels generally aren't for busy people, I don't think, but I'd say it was worth my time.\n\nA word about the Restoration Patch. I decided to have the entire game here for my first playthrough, and so I have the patch installed. This restores the nudity... full (slightly censored) nudity, and full-on sex scenes. I plan to play through the Korori route a second time with the game at Steam's standard configuration and edit this later on, to see the differences and edit this review to give my own analysis of the differences between the two. That said... they're pretty hot.\n\nSo if you've got a lot of time on your hands and you don't have a manga you'd rather put a few bucks toward, I can recommend If My Heart Had Wings. As to the soundtrack, it doesn't cost that much more, but while there are a few decent tracks, it's mostly what I would call "below par" where video game music is concerned. If you need to not spend a couple extra bucks, you can safely pass it up.","December 28, 2015","false","87.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tarvok/recommended/326480/","tarvok","tarvok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tarvok/","18 products in account","EDIT: I have played a bit of the Steam configuration of the game, and I have decided that I cannot recommend the game in its current state. The review below assumes you have fully modded the game with the restoration patch. This review, and the unrecommendation, assume the game as Steam installs it. I cannot recommend a game that requires modding to be decent.\n\nThe censoring is not the issue. I don't really have a problem of the removal of the sex scenes. I have read that some of the story is butchered a bit to avoid such scenes, but I haven't actually reached that point. I don't need to, to update this review.\n\nThe problem is the translation. It isn't as halting and awkward as I was lead to believe (though I'm only a few days into the game at this point), but there are some truly glaring errors in the translation.\n\nThe worst example is the use of the word "grade" where they ought to be using the word "year". For instance, there is a part where the main character and his friend are discussing the awesome time the main character took third in a bicycle race when he was in "first grade". I'm a great big weeaboo, so I know what they were trying to say: his first year at that school (likely fourteen or fifteen years old). But it just brings to mind the sight of a teenage guy still proud about how his athletic career peaked at six years of age.\n\nThen there's the girl at the dorm, who is apparently the oldest one there. She's in fourth grade, apparently. (I swear, officer, she didn't look that young!) Of course, that means she's in her fourth year of this specialist high school (most Japanese high schools only go three years). Severely problematic for someone who's not already deep in the fan community.\n\nA lesser issue I'd like MoeNovel to revisit is the attempt to translate "sempai" and "kohai". This translation uses the word "senior" and "junior", respectively, in contexts that would suggest to an American reader that they are in their third and fourth year at the school, when it reality it just means one is older than the other. Current practice is to leave those words untranslated (as they have no English equivalent), and just trust that the information is readily availble, because it is.\n\nFinally, most of the reviews it will complain to the swallowtail route. When I wrote the part of before that, I'm for about playing in the middle of the Asaruto, and the translation was not great. But I have to play the final in the Ageha route, someone, translated into Japan took the English Google again, is the it through to it ran Such translated it I feel. Japanese, and back again.\n\nThus, I cannot recommend the game in its current state. But if you want to play it, read the review below, and then look for installation instructions for the Restoration Patch.\n\nIt took me a while to decide whether or not I was going to recommend this game. On the one hand, the story was fun and rewarding. On the other hand, it isn't "gamelike" enough. Just before this one, I played Clannad; this is no Clannad.\n\nTo be honest, this would, in my opinion, make a better manga than visual novel. There are a few places where the soundtrack and visual effects add to the experience, but for the most part, the entire story could be conveyed well through images on a page. The alternate stories are few enough, and the choices needed to choose between those stories few enough, that simply releasing an alternate story in another volume would work.\n\nThat said, it was a great story, and given that I got it for $4.94 (on sale as of this writing), the only real expense was the time. Visual novels generally aren't for busy people, I don't think, but I'd say it was worth my time.\n\nA word about the Restoration Patch. I decided to have the entire game here for my first playthrough, and so I have the patch installed. This restores the nudity... full (slightly censored) nudity, and full-on sex scenes. I plan to play through the Korori route a second time with the game at Steam's standard configuration and edit this later on, to see the differences and edit this review to give my own analysis of the differences between the two. That said... they're pretty hot.\n\nSo if you've got a lot of time on your hands and you don't have a manga you'd rather put a few bucks toward, I can recommend If My Heart Had Wings. As to the soundtrack, it doesn't cost that much more, but while there are a few decent tracks, it's mostly what I would call "below par" where video game music is concerned. If you need to not spend a couple extra bucks, you can safely pass it up.","December 28, 2015","false","87.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or are you helping another along to their dream? Why do you do that? These are the main themes that I found in If My Heart Had Wings.\n\nI would recommend this visual novel as a good starter to see whether you might like the genre or not, especially the part that involves sitting and reading for long periods of time. It has a good soundtrack and I still listen to a couple of the tracks every now and then. The story, characters and artwork are decent. There is nothing that blows the mind or makes the jaw drop, but they fit together well and make the visual novel enjoyable. There are few decision points and many save slots to help getting used to how to play a visual novel.\n\nThere is one issue that stops me making this a strong recommendation – the translation. The translation either wasn’t quality checked or the quality check was very poor. I had to really focus to keep track of the story around the badly translated parts. The story log really helps in that respect.","May 24, 2015","true","48.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let me tell you this is not the case! As you progress your relationship with your chosen girl the story starts to develop based around that character and the story changes to suit what partner you chose, which really adds to the replayability of the game. Considering how likeable the characters are you will want to go through every route you can, which is exactly what I did.\n\nI was new to visual novels completely and I can wholeheartedly say purchasing this will have you not wanting to return to real life, it is that great! As other reviews have most likely mentioned, the restoration patch is a must for myself and I do recommend it to anyone who purchases the game. I am not even particularly interested in the hentai itself and found myself skipping over those scenes when I feel they didn't add much to character progression. I just enjoyed using the patch as not only is a lot of translation errors fixed, the many scenes that were cut are added again and the sexual innuendos had me laughing.\n\nOverall an incredibly heartwarming story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/-Tsunderella-/recommended/326480/","-Tsunderella-","LS*","http://steamcommunity.com/id/-Tsunderella-/","472 products in account","Alrighty. A review for Kono Oozora ni Tsubasa wo Hirogete/If My Heart Had Wings.\nFor people new to this sort of game genre, this is a Visual Novel. That means it's text-heavy and is basically like reading a book except there's drawings of landscapes, cute girls, some clouds or something, with added voice-acting and a pretty good soundtrack.\n\nIf My Heart Had Wings is a visual novel about Minase Aoi, a dude who was in a bicycle race accident, after which he transfers to a school in his old hometown and meets old friends, new friends, and a glider which changes his life for the better.\n\nWithout going into further detail, it's actually a REALLY GOOD visual novel. I'd even say it's better than Katawa Shoujo, but that's my personal opinion (pls don't flame me). The characters are really interesting, the voice acting is SUPERB, and the soundtrack is just a pleasure to listen to. The interface for the game is relatively simple and shouldn't be too hard to navigate. (no, really. i mean you just keep clicking anyway)\n\nWhat about bad points?\n\nIf you're wondering why I'm not talking about the storyline, it's because of MoeNovel. The translation of MoeNovel removes some vital "plot points" which makes certain routes in the game not make a lot of sense. However, if you do get the restoration patch, the translation turns out better and all plot is returned to normal. (or if you're just looking for some lewd bits, go on ahead. story's still pretty damn good tho.)\n\nIn short:\nIMHHW is an amazing visual novel, if you include the patch. If you can get it on sale, highly recommended.\nIf you're also looking for a good story-based experience but don't want to read a book, this is the game for you.\n[even though it's pretty much a book]\nVerdict: Solid 8.8/10. This is an amazing game. Get it.\nAlso: Duck wearing a hat as a supporting character. Pretty good feature if you ask me.\nPS. kotori best girl fite me","February 8, 2015","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm probably a rare breed, for finding visual novels which doesn't emphasize primarily on sex is what I look for in VNs. Steam has many VNs, but a lot of them focus on sex and vulgarity. This VN on the other hand emphasises more on the story, character development, and romance in a good way. I know this sounds pretty weird, but I've always wanted something similar to 'Angel Beats', the anime, and this is probably pretty close to it. Like I said before, I just started so maybe this review will change, but as of right now it is very calming and pleasant. I've heard there is a patch where they uncensor parts of the story to make it more sexually perverted, so just promise me to play your first walkthrough without it.

Each time you go through with different options, the first and second acts are more or less similar with a few differing scenes, but from that point onward it's completely different.
