Oh and they somehow found a way to add more bugs. It would be a good game if they bothered to update it. If you are looking for a cricket Football Manager you will left wanting. It looks and feels cheap and unloved.\nIt was worth 20 dollars 14 years ago. Its worth $5 today.\nAVOID!!!!!!!

It has had fairly minor tweaks over the years as my original tactics used to dominate one dayers dont work anymore and of course 20/20s arent all that old.\n\nThis game brings back memories...I played the first copy that I had to death and found a spreadsheet on an old usb that had stats for an England Captain game from 2000 to 2026 on it earlier today!  I've also bought a version that had Phil Hughes on the cover that I remember he averaged 65ish opening for Australia (might have been 2009?) as well as the 2011, 13 & 14 versions.  This is the best of the lot with the different game modes and a one-day engine that I haven't figured out yet (I'm only 30 odd hours in).\n\nThere is a reason I keep spreadsheets with this game - it has 1 big bug....at the end of the season some players may disappear!  It's something that's happened since the first version and with Nathan Lyon magically disappearing and taking his 176 wickets @ 31 as Australia's only spinner with him in 2015 I certainly noticed (particularly as Ryan Harris just retired and I lost 1/2 my bowling attack in 1 off season)....it's a worry when Maxwell is your frontline spinner!\n\nIt's sheer playability and the constant searching for that next great player helps to get over any quirks in the match engine as pretty much anything can be chalked up to it being cricket (still not sure how I got rolled for 50 in a T20 and then won the world cup only a couple of months later).\n\nJust like Football Manager you'll make attachments to players you've never heard of...I see from my original game Matthew Bulbeck played 176 tests scoring 6898 runs at 36.11 and took 754 wickets at 28.65 (I'm sure he wouldn't have minded that sort of career and I've tried with Butterworth and Faulkner in recent years to find a similarly performing left handed allrounder) while I had a regen, G Fuller play 207 tests, score 20155 runs @ 70.97 with a HS of 397 and 75 100s.\n\nIn this years game I'm only up to 2016/17 with Australia but Chris Lynn 19 tests 1459 runs @  54.04, Ryan Carters 21 tests 1314 runs @ 50.54 and Glenn Maxwell 17 tests 808 runs @ 42.53, 35 wickets @ 35.23 would be pretty happy with their new careers!","December 30, 2014","true","129.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","3"

The interface has been modernized, which is nice, but the new interface is poorly executed. Columns don't always line up when looking at stats, numbers have bits chopped off, letter spacing is irregular, ect. It has never been a pretty game, but the new interface is seriously ugly to look at, and if you have a decent size monitor you'll find yourself playing it in a window to make it bearable visually. The only positive is the inclusion of a "hawkeye" style ball tracker, which is useful when bowling in T20.\n\nThe "new" match engine is identical to previous years - the tweaks have been to graphics rather than game play, and even that hasn't really worked, as there is now an irritating lag when skipping through a highlight. Batting in T20 is still impossibly hard if you don't have a couple of star names, and T20 matches generally are still as boring and formulaic as before. The better side wins nine times out of ten, which completely negates the point of playing a management sim. 50 over and four day cricket allow you to have more of an effect on the result, but the flaws remain. The same plans work every time when bowling, and if you deviate from the steady progression of aggression when batting you invariably fail. There is zero opportunity to try something different, and the game is crying out for the kind of specific instructions that a real cricket captain would issue.\n\nThe reviewer who compared this game to Football Manager must be joking. Football Manager has an almost infinite number of formations/tactical instructions/player instructions, whilst this has one slider to control batting and two to control bowling. Even if you're desperate to use an updated database then Cricket Captain 2014 is overpriced for such a basic simulation. Buy Don Bradman Cricket or Football Manager 2014 instead.\n","August 10, 2014","false","17.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

So when I learnt that Cricket Captain was coming to Steam naturally I was excited. Playing the game brought back all those nostalgic feelings of my youth but after an hour or so something occured to me and made me realize just why I had that feeling\n\nIt's the same f***ing game.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't mean that as like "oh it's nostalgic and a great throwback" I mean the same game as in nothing's changing, sure the graphics have SLIGHTLY improved and there are a few new quirks like Hawkeye but it's the same animations, the same featureless blobs in what should be players and the same looking screeens between bits of footage.\n\nNot only that, the AI has somehow gotten WORSE in this iteration. For all the illusion of control you have your batsmen have all of two states of play, "Two Runs an Over" or "Swing at everything like your 5 year old brother in the backyard". Meanwhile the opposing AI has no trouble whatsoever going merrily at 4, 5, 6 runs an over regardless of what fields and what agression you have set on your bowling.\n\nThe game engine is a mess, the Australian career mode is a joke and the same animations that were in the game in 1999 are here in 2014.\n\nDo NOT buy this game. For the love of god make Childish Things get their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ together. This game is an abomination on all mankind. If you want a good cricket management game buy Cricket Coach, it has no graphics or commentary to speak of but at least that has an excuse (It's made by a one man development team).

There were some problems at start to actually get the game working, however thanks to a dedicated support team I was able to get everything sorted out! This year's iteration brought a new interface which is visually pleasing yet may be lacking some features from the last iterations but this new style is a change for the good. This year for Childish Things was more trying to expand to other devices than adding, which is understandable since there isn't a huge amount of people who buy it on PC.\n\nYou start out being able to; Start a new game, Start a new tournament, Load a game or play multiple player over the net. I started my game how I do every year and started a new career with Hampshire, disapointed at the lacking of other domestic setups. In the market I was estatic to bring in a 19 year old with a 2nd team average of 50! Sadly it didnt last long and my game crashed and I lost all my progess, RIP Greg Long! Restarted and I must say, the game for me is much smoother! It is way easier to move around from option to option and I, unlike previous iterations, could notice a huge difference from last years.\n\nThe game may be missing features and have 1 or 2 bugs, but I can assure you that this years Cricket Captain is a must buy and who knows, maybe in a further update I, and many others, may be able to use de Kock, Pienaar and Piedt all in the same team!

However, the new User Interface (UI) of the present edition is the worst I have played on. The UI is not intuitive at all. All the buttons have been put at the worst of places. Viewing information about a player has become a big task. The UI disappoints me beyond anger or grief. Putting on fancy pants does not assure you a win in the beauty contest.  Plus, the obivious criticism of the lack of game play still remains. A big let down!","December 18, 2014","false","6.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
