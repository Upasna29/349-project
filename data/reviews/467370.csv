Tho it looked ugly the dev was reacting fast and polished up graphics quickly. Way more to come. Also awaiting more community generated content. Because of the simple level exchange atm (in form of txt files, easy to copy content into a discussion thread). Also I'm excited about further development and will keep an eye on it. Surely the 5 easy achievements are a dooropener to take a closer look . Hopefully more will come ...","May 13","true","1.1"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

The concept of it is cool, a little cube goes around and tries to escape different maps. There are many obstacles along the way, turrets, spinning obstacles and parts of the floor that if you step on you get injured. One of my biggest problems with it was that I was unsure when I died because it had no  GAME OVER  or  You're Dead screens, it just went to the loading screen. Obviously the graphics may not be the best, but it was made in Unity so I'm gonna give it some slack. The biggest plus for me was the achievements, I got all 5 in  2 minutes  of playing!\n\nPros  Cheap\nEasy To Play\nCan Get All Achievements In 2 Minutes\nCons  Very Rough\nConfusing Enemies\nLittle Instructions\nUnity Game\n\nOverall I would not say I regretted this game because I am an achievement hunter and I did end up 100% it. Will I ever come back to this game? Honestly probably not unless the creator added more achievements. If the game was polished a bit more it would be a fun little game to play. In it's current state I would not recommend it.\n\n2/10\n","May 28","false","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Atleast I got an easy 100% game done...Right!?Ok so yeah, I got this game for free from a giveaway so I'll treat it as such. +1 point\nStraight off the bat I notice this is a Programmer game and by that I mean simple illuminated cubes with different colors to tell you what is what or atleast I thought it was.\nThere’s perhaps 10-15 levels I don't really know and I realized after a few levels when it changed to a level I had already done before that the levels are randomly selected on completion.\n\nWithin the first 6 minutes I had all the achievements unlocks, which I'm not complaining about so +1 there.\n\nThere’s no instructions so you just have to figure it out which is fine in the beginning when you (the blue cube) have to dodge the red things and get to the green thing.... but sometimes red blocks don't even do anything, they just push you around and there’s some kind of health system on some levels but not all where you can hit red things for a little bit before doing. Then there are purple teleporters and light blue switches but the issue is when you go from a simple level at the start then it randomly picks a level with like 15 different colored blocks and you're like ok what does this do, oh I shouldn't have stood on that red colored ground.... oh wait I'm not dying... oh but that other red thing kills me... ok\n\n3/10 Giving this game a positive review because it was free, I got 100% achievements out of it and I like colorful cubes","May 28","true","1.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
