Since you must not pull the ball into an obstacle, or end up on a spike trap, this usually leaves you with a limited number of possible moves, setting up the labyrinth structure that's often at the base of these kind of puzzle games. The challenge is to find the correct sequence of moves, and when there is more than one, to find the perfect sequence with the least number of moves.\n\nWhile the gameplay is original (as far as I know), it's nothing earth-shattering; but then again, the game is fun, cheap (even cheaper on the Indiegala Monday bundle), looks ok at its 1024x768 resolution windowed or fullscreen, has an effective UI that doesn't get in the way, and provides more than 100 levels.\n\nRecommended.","July 7, 2015","true","1.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

No youtube videos exist so i am genuinely curious on how to perfect certain levels.\n\n- Vertical pull buttons shallow bright blue color should be better highlighted. I play on living room tv and i dont always notice when a vertical button is lit.\n\n- Gameplay is grid based so its strange that there is no gamepad support. small detail though. works fine as it is too.","July 22, 2015","true","2.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I'm not usually a fan of this type of puzzle game but thought I would give this one a try.\n\nThe difficulty progression in the first few worlds that I have progressed through has been very well done. New concepts are introduced at a steady pace to keep things interesting. I often find the difficulty of this time of game either stays too easy or ramps up to quickly, so far this one is just right.","July 24, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
