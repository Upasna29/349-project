It looks like this is the first review of this game on Steam.\nNice one. Where's my prize? :-)","March 28","true","2.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Unfortunately, however, it appears to have been sadly ignored in the Steam catalog since it was released about a week ago. The game deserves much more attention by puzzle fans as there is much to enjoy about the game. Besides, if the cute soundtrack doesn’t put a smile on your face I’m not certain what will.\n\nBut besides the soundtrack, the Steam description below saves me the trouble of explaining it to you but read it please, the overall presentation of the game has been really well done. I’m an unabashed numbers guy. I’ve followed statistics and my entire life. It started out with trying to understand all of the different numbers and statistics in all of the various sports that I enjoy and then sprouted from there. To see a puzzle game that is strictly about numbers and sorting the pattern out to get to them is my jam. What makes it even better is when there are a number of different mechanics featured in the game such as sliding and switching the blocks. It makes you concentrate so much more especially when you know that each puzzle has been immaculately designed with a real solution that makes you put your thinking cap on.\n\nI’m not going to tell you that the game is perfect. Ideally I’d love to have seen a level editor included with the game so that people could make their own levels up. This is the perfect game where I would have loved to have been able to make challenges for Ainslie to solve only for her to create even more difficult levels to try and get me back. Then we’d love to share our lovely levels with you gorgeous people on the Steam store. But if the lack of a level editor is my biggest gripe about the game itself, and it is, then I have to believe that the game is doing alright for itself. The other issue is the price. I’m not quite sold on it being a $4.99 game. It seems a dollar or two too high but I can appreciate why the price point is set there. If there were a little bit more to the game (such as that level editor) I’d be happy to really recommend it but at this price perhaps its best for a sale unless you’re like me and really love your number puzzle games. I think the price may be keeping players at bay.\n\nI hope that the sales and Steam reviews for the game pick up. It’s a very cleverly designed game with good production values.\n\nVisit Steamified[www.steamified.com] for more reviews and our epic giveaways","April 7","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
