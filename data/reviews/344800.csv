You are playing a powerful executive in a UFC-style company (not a fighter!) who is in charge of hiring fighters and scheduling matches (like Joe Silva). There are two game modes available: the standard "Career" mode, where you pick a suit, choose his skillset and control a company, and "Quick Fight" mode, where you can easily pair two fighters and see the fight. The career mode is deliberately made less deep than Football Manager's, for instance. I'd rather not call it a Manager game at all. Financial management is limited. The emphasis is on filling your events with attractive matchups and watching the gameworld unfold. You can adjust the rules to be more like PRIDE and can even host legendary UFC 8-man tournaments. It's all up to you. Just watch out to keep your finances positive and that you have some ethnic diversity on your roster.\n\nGameplay comes down to scheduling fights and scouting potential fighters based on skills, popularity and hype. Will you sign the charismatic ones, the superskilled ones, or will you populate your company with average joes to make your stars look good? There's some weight class management as well. Fighters' stats are quite deep and reflect the game of MMA very well imo. There's things like 'punch power', 'low kick speed', 'muay thai clinch elbow technique', 'killer instinct', 'leglock submissions', Altogether this makes 85+ stats that directly impact the fighter's performance, which is amazing. These stats are constantly progressing as fighters visit camps to train. Once they reach a certain age, certain skills start to deteriorate. Older veterans, however, are often more popular given their history. Will you make them look good as look as possible, or feed them to younger talents?\n\nThe game really shines on the part that comes after the gameplay. You don't even have to play to enjoy the game and can turn over control to the AI anytime or watch other AI companies. Afterwards you can sign their stars and pit them against yours. Just don't forget that Japanese stars aren't as popular in the USA as they are at home. When fight night arrives, you get to watch all the fights you want, which is often a trilling experience if you bring yourself to care about the characters. Information hits the screen on a play-by-play basis: every action gets mentioned until you press 'space' to continue to the next. Upset victories have you jump up from your chair in disbelief.\n\nThere's also a sandbox option for the people who just want to hire people and have them fight. You will never get fired, run out of money or have matchups refused. Fighters also won't need to prepare in this mode. Either way, the game has limitless replay value as it just keeps going, creating a new fighter whenever one retires. One of the best things about the game is the support for modders: There's real life mods, there's expansions for the fictional one that comes with the game, there's a video game characters mod, etc. Anyone can easily mod the game during gameplay or make new characters and importing them into your existing game is child's play. More games should have this kind of support.\n\nWhile I really enjoy the game and have spend hundreds of hours on it, there are several things about the game that could potentially frustrate you, so consider this a warning:\n\n* Due to the resources used to create the game the resolution of this game is fixed, so there's no full screen mode. There's no 'fix' for this. On my 22" screen it takes about half the screen. If this somehow bothers you, try the demo first on their official website. I personally decorate my desktop with MMA-style graphics to counter this. I suggest you do the same.\n\n* It's a text-based simulator so there's few graphics: there are (often quite nice-looking) renders of all the fighters, and there's promotion logo's and banners. During the fights, there's no visual representation. Personally, I think that's great as you can imagine the fights taking place without visual restrictions. However, this obviously requires some imagination. And to imagine it you also need some MMA knowledge. If you've only watched a couple of UFC events you might get lost in the positions and interactions. You don't need to be an expert or a practitioner: just a fan who watches regularly and knows what an 'americana' or the 'north-south position' is.\n\n* There's actually an advanced version of the game available called WMMA4 on the developer's website. This game has more options and tweaks to fix some problems mentioned in other reviews (like the contract signings). I think it's a great improvement but the difference is not so groundbreaking to wait years before it finally comes to Steam (if you don't want to buy directly from their store).\n\nIf you are not bothered by these things and are a fan of MMA, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy the game. I posted a small guide/tutorial to help you book your first MMA event. You can even run it with the free demo on the GDS site. If the outcome doesn't excite you, maybe text-based sims aren't your thing. But any MMA fan owes it to himself to try. :)","March 24, 2015","true","5.0"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

Boy, was I right. By "right up my alley" I mean life-consuming time-destroyer. Very few games have ever actually made me emotional. The part of Red Dead Redemption when you first ride into Mexico as the sun is setting and the music starts playing, that made me emotional, I felt a sense of freedom and adventure that no game has before, or since, evoked in me. That, however, is not the kind of emotion I get from WMMA3. The emotions I have felt in this game have ranged from "NO! I just spent 5 fights getting this dude up to main event status and now he refuses to resign with me!?" (Anger) to "HOW DID SHE POSSIBLY LOSE TO THAT BUM I ONLY HIRED FOR ONE FIGHT" (Also anger, and confusion) and also "This dude wins the belt and now wants to take a hiatus to spend more time with his family? WHO CARES ABOUT YOUR FAMILY! GET IN THAT CAGE AND MAKE ME MONEY YOU JERK!" (Anger again.....hmmmm, this game really seems to anger me). But I digress, although the game can be infuriating at times it's also supremely satisfying to set up a ripper of a card and have everything fall into place as you get fight ratings of Great/Fantastic and the ever elusive Excellents. I usually judge games based on $/Hr of Gameplay. My base ratio being 1:1. I spent $22CAD on this game on a sale and so far I'm at 142hrs on record so a ratio of 22:142 or $1/6.45hrs so I am extremely happy with my purchase. If MMA and Simulation games are your thing and you're not on a hunt for mind melting visuals and sweeping orchestral soundtracks and would rather just have some fun setting up MMA fight cards and building up your own MMA company, this is the game for you my friend (I assume if you are looking at this game on Steam, we'd probably be friends, unless you're a jerk, in which case, I don't want to be friends, you jerk).","July 28, 2015","true","193.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","8","11","6","0"

How open the game is in terms of outcomes and the challenge of building up a fighter's reputation, win streaks are all big plusses. My favourite part of this game is the booking, especially one night tournaments which makes it so easy to progress through the weeks and months and play this game in short bursts. It's been a lot of fun so far, looking to make matches to keep win streaks going but at the same time, put on a good show. My only gripe is I can't plan shows upto a year in advance as I like to get the shows booked and get on with seeing the results.\n\nWMMA3 is probably my favourite of the series so far, so I'd definitely recommend this game to anybody considering this if you like management/simulation games.","March 24, 2015","true","58.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I've played it since the first version was relased and found each version a nice step up from the previous. This version isn't the newest either, but I've still played this one more.\n\nFirst off, this game is going to appeal to the gamer who wants to be an owner and matchmaker for an MMA organization rather than a fighter. This is not one of those take over a guy and see how high you can get him games, it more strategy and sand box than that. Think of Sim City meets UFC.\n\nGraphics are not present in the game, and the fight play by plays can get repetitive after a few thousand fights, but that doesn't change the interest in the fight for me. With this being more of a sandbox game you have the option to watch the world unfold, or to actively grow your company. You can choose to stay small and thrive or go for broke and become the top company in the world.\n\nIt's still too easy to become financially sound in the game, so some house rules might need to be in order, but the fun factor isn't impacted. Fights themselves can be "watched" or simply simmed with the results shown afterward. Once you've become accustomed to the world it's easy to get locked into that one more turn feel. Setting up your next matchups, developing young fighters or deciding to let your icon leave because he just can't do it anymore are all choices you'll have to make.\n\nYou'll also have the opportunity to tweak the rule set for your company and that can have a massive effect on what guys are going to perform best for you and your relevance in the larger MMA world.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with this game and have no problem recommending the game for people who love MMA and contol over the business aspects of the sport.","September 8, 2015","true","0.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

I highly recommend googling Modern Warriors mod if you do buy this game. That mod makes this game for me. That mod has rosters for all of the promotions including the full UFC roster. The majority of your time will be spent scheduling when and where your events will take place and who will fill the fight card. You are rated at the end of every event by commercial and critical responses. Critical responses are just how exciting the fights actually were, while commercials deals more with the matchups on paper. Lastly, you can change basically every rule the UFC has, including how many/long the rounds are.

Although the basic premise is, well, basic - you have to book events that feature fights between your company's fighters - the gameplay is very engaging as you try to decide how to draw in fans, who to promote, who has the potential of becoming a superstar, how many fighters can you have before you are unable to make them popular enough to carry you financially, who to hire and who to let go etc.\n\nHowever, the thing that makes it even better are emergent storylines and emergent world. Just as in, for example, Paradox Interactive grand strategies or football managers, half of the fun is not in the strategy and planning but in seeing how various decisions and random factors converge into narratives - the fighters, with their gradually scouted skills, fight histories and pre-MMA backgrounds, become almost real people whose careers you watch, who you cheer for (or against), whose successes you celebrate and failures mourn (or shout at the monitor about). You begin to notice personal quirks in the fighting (which is described to you purely by text - but in a dynamic and entertaining way), you start to like or dislike certain fighters, you plot a favourite youngster's rise to fame by a series of easy matches and weep as he gets beaten down by weaker but more experienced employees, you carefully consider whether your nostalgia for a former champion is strong enough to extend his contract even when he's way past his prime, you plot an ideal title match by giving enough exposure to the contender (or, as I once did, seek for a fighter who would be able to fight the belt away from that jerk I stupidly gave a shot at the title only to discover that he's good, but he's a sucker who wins fights by masterfuly smothering the enemy against the cage wall for 5 rounds straight which puts the crowd to sleep) and rejoice as your plan comes to fruition, you contemplate the fall of another federation - and then race against the competition to grab their best stars...\n\nThis game is by no means perfect. Its interface takes a lot of time to get used to, and even then it's basically just not good. (WMMA4 seems to be much better in that department - but it's not on Steam. :() The fight descriptions can become a bit repetitive and boring if you play for many dozens of hours (although even then you can be surprised and entertained when a match goes in a direction you'd have never thought about). The character pool could be bigger (although there's a healthy amount of mods on the developer's page that can help with that). But once you get sucked in, those flaws don't seem big enough to discourage you from planning just one more event, staying just until the TV station sends its reply about your new show idea, fast-forwarding to the beginning of just one more month to see the new recruits in the MMA industry, seeing your champion defend his title just one more time...","June 2, 2015","true","413.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

They don't make much money, they have virtually no attendee's and inexplicably have a world class fighter on $500,000 per fight - which is guaranteed to bankrupt the organisation.\n\nAfter a few in game months of running the organisation into the ground, I started to lose hope.  But I restarted and chose one of the bigger federations, and after a year I've made quite a bit of money and feel like I am actually 'competing' with the other top companies.\n\nIt is not entirely clear what you are doing when you start out, what you are aiming for and what your immediate goals should be - especially if you don't take the easy option and go for a top federation.\n\nI feel the game is missing quite a few features that would attract a wider audience.  In one sense, it reminds me of a beta run of the original Football Manager game - but a bare bones versiona at that.  Databases full of 'ever so slightly different looking' fighters are one thing, but there need to be more actual features the user can use in order to feel they are actually influencing the path of the gameplay.\n\nIn many ways, this game is for me "Joe Silva (UFC head booker) MMA contract and booking simulator" instead of WMMA3.   And the contract system is WOEFUL.  Why on earth you have to have a time delay on signing talent - especially unemployed fighters - is beyond me.  Well, not really.  It's clearly a way of filling space in the game where nothing happens between events.  That to me hints at a lack of a finished article to me.\n\nWhat I would have liked in the game is more focus on training facilities/gyms that you can invest in, media events to send fighters to, sponsorship deals, drugs scandals, a more developed in-fight text display with a greater variety of descriptions (eventually incorporating some kind of graphical display). greater interaction with the fighters, inter - federation matches, and more.  But I do appreciate that you have to draw the line between a text based engine and a sports game such as the UFC Undisputed series, as you can't really have the depth of detail and the sports sim in the same game.\n\nUltimately though, I do recommend the game and I have enjoyed playing it.","August 22, 2015","true","141.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a really great game, but I would only recommend it if you're a huge MMA fan. It's pretty useless if you're not. The mods for this game are really great, although not as regularly updated as the mods for the TEW series. One major complaint I have about the game is the contract system, it's quite tedious to lose fighters and have no idea you've lost them, because you forgot to check your e-mail one time. That is a minor flaw, but it can make the game quite hard to get in to.\n\nI bought it for 2.50 from Bundlestars and am incredibly happy I did, as I don't think I'd pay 20 euros plus for it.\n\n9/10.\n\nHopefully WMMA4 will come to steam some day and improve on the already great features of the series and make it a must play for even casual MMA fans.","September 29, 2015","true","164.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Perfect example of "graphics aren't everything".\n\nAs you can see, I have put a little bit of time into this sim. And I have loved (almost) every minute of it. I only have one complaint though. The fighter contract system can get quite tedious as it is all manually done. I hear this is fixed in the newest version and it lets you automate contract renewals so I can't wait to see WMMA4 up on Steam in the near future.\n\nIt is important to note that I am not a fan of Elicense, which is the DRM that the official Greydog Software website version is using, hence why I purchase Mr. Ryland's games exclusively through Steam.

You take the role of a budding MMA shot caller on a large scale stage. There are multiple organizations you can be a part of. Your main job is to take an organization, create powerful performing events, set up media relationships for PPV's and new TV shows featuring your brand, but most importantly, you can handle fighter contracts and hype. Sign some of the best current talent or scout for up and coming current talents. You are able to shortlist every fighter in the game to ensure you are on top of expiring contracts. There is no greater feeling in the world than sniping the oppositions heaviest hitter when his contract is up.\n\nThis game should be relatively easy to run. It hosts literally 100's of hours worth of play maybe even thousands. The community is thriving and there are a boat load of mods out there to help bring that extra step of realism to the game. This ''text'' based game is the best MMA management game on the market. We will be doing a piece of the various MMA based offerings on our website in the near future. In the mean time, pick this game up!\n\n- Antony Gallagher via www.bittrauma.net","December 14, 2015","true","38.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
