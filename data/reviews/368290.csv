"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krylo22/recommended/368290/","krylo22","Krylo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krylo22/","379 products in account","Although conceptually wonderful, this game has flaws that spoil the fun.\n\nI almost feel a sense of conflict with the design: the simplicity of placing lights to guide your path is met with difficult level pathing and frustratingly grindy attempts to replace all your lights upon dying or misclicking a lantern.\n\nI'll start with the gameplay and then do a pros/cons section. You're given a small number of lanterns to place in a dark room, revealing parts of the surrounding area. You then manouver your character through this dark room, overcoming obstacles such as spikes and bottomless pits (these will kill you) to reach the black square at the end of the level.\n\nPros:  - Effective and interesting gameplay concept.\n- The music (acoustic strings) is melodious and soothing. It's quite a subtle and nice background noise.\n- Controls are simple, easy to use and responsive.\n- Shadow and lighting effects are executed fairly nicely.\n\nCons: - Level design. Even in clear lighting, there are some jumps and obstacles that are very punishing when they don't need to be. Trying to overcome jumps in clear sight distracts from the challenge of  visibility .\n- Resets. Upon dying or misplacing a lantern (in a wall for instance) you're forced to reset the level and place your lights all over again. Nevermind how long you spent trying to get your lantern placements perfect. If you didn't die so many times per level, I don't think this would be an issue.\n- Too few lights to place. A difficult jump or obstacle is that much harder without lighting- it makes sense that you'll spend time fumbling in the dark, but the levels should allow for that with the number of lights you're given.\n\nI finished this game by taping a piece of plastic over my monitor and highlighting (on the plastic) places where perfect lighting could be achieved. I used a new sheet on every level so I wouldn't get confused, and the spikes  still  killed me in dark areas.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I recommend holding out for a sale. Otherwise, pick it up if you enjoy trial and error or think your patience can endure the frustrations. If you can, I'm sure you'll find more fun in this than I did.","August 27, 2015","false","5.9"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

All of this is lit by lights you position and which throw deep shadows which are - well - mostly blocky-looking or spiky-looking.\n\nThat means finding your way around a level isn't a game of skill, it's a memory/repeated-trial test.  It's not like there's a solid answer to 'where should you put the lights' - it's most "throw them around, try different places, figure out a route and do it"\n\nMissed opportunity really - it's not a BAD game but it really could have used a bit more detail/color/contrast to make placing the lights more of a puzzle and less of a trial-and-error test.","November 18, 2015","false","0.1"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sergeant_Dornan/recommended/368290/","Sergeant_Dornan","Sergeant Dornan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sergeant_Dornan/","275 products in account","Visibility...is sorely lacking in this game. It's up to you to place the lamps all over the level and curse the level design when a lamp only shows a very tiny, enclosed space between platforms. Even then, there is no guarantee of an easy level completion. Dying by spikes is incredibly common, and the tried and true trial and error principle is right at home. By no means is the game unfair, however. Moderately challenging, yes, but not unfair. Definitely worth a shot if you're willing to put your nerves and patience to the test!","May 25, 2015","true","1.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Why not start from the beginning, well of course. Months ago I remember the creator working on some small project, all it was to begin, probably, can't fully remember. But he offered to me the alpha, so I graciously accepted the offer, and boy was I surprised about the depth of the game, there's so much more than just a simple indie game, and it does come across as very enjoyable.\n\nLet's get this pajama party of a review started with an insight into the game itself, then we can work further into it as this progresses. Now at first glance, you may look down on the blocky graphics that could run on a SNES, and the same lighting as a collapsed mine, but looks can be deceiving and in this case their scant nature is what builds the game. It is the deep pitch-dark view you are presented with that draws you in, “what's this”, you think as you remember the controls, “ah yes, all I need to do is add my own light”, begging the question of 'how many rectangles does it take to change a lightbulb?'\n\nOne. It seems.\n\nBut really, these simplistic graphics are a real powerhouse in this modern era of high-tech graphics, where many gamers focus too much on the initial, skin-level, aesthetics of a game, angrily reviewing graphics alone. No, this game is a true light to me, showing that, like many indie games, graphics are not a huge priority in making a game a game. Rectangles and a broken dimmer switch make this game truly glorious and straightforward in the most necessary of areas.\n\nThe general feel and flow of the game and its controls are perfect, responsive and accurate, testing each player's ability to platform, as well as their ability to puzzle solve, with the light placement being the centre point of completing a level. I was honestly amazed by the tuning of the game and the polish the creator has drummed in, a very admirable result from a single man trying to juggle this game with education. It really does have a “Thomas was Alone” feel to it, I find myself with that same voice in my head, 'Troy was alone, but he was good at falling, and this reverse falling'...\n\n'Oh, and dying.'\n\nThis happens a lot as you progress, getting to the levels full of spikes, trial and error would apply, but there isn't enough error in that phrase. More like a lot of error, and occasional failing a bit further into the level, and only then, when your psyche is in ashes and you have every death achievement, do you have the creator's permission to finish the level.\n\nOverall, this game is damn near perfect, it doesn't overstay its welcome, it's concise and lasts as long as it needs to. One cannot complain about the game being small, as an indie game it is meant to be a shorter game, not being a hardcore game, though one that is still as challenging as the high end of modern puzzlers. So I do highly recommend this game, and this isn't because the creator has paid me (he hasn't) but because it really is an amazing game to distract yourself from the harsh realities of life.\n","May 25, 2015","true","0.3"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","15","21","4","2"

You're gonna rage quit after a while, squinting at the screen trying to figure out where is what.\n\nHope the rest of yea have more patience as I have.\n\nI think there should be more easier levels first before having too many spikes in the level.\nThat will give player a bit more confidence to try a few more times at the level.\n\nWorth playing, Just because it just defines a genre of it's own.","August 29, 2015","true","0.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

If this is early access, it's a good start. If this isn't early access, put it into early access.\n\n+The art style is simple, and yet, still feels unique.\n\n*********************************************************************************************************************\n-This feels like it was meant to be a Puzzle platformer, but the mechanic doesn't work well enough for this to be a puzzle game.\n\n-The best strategy I could come up with was to randomly place lights over and over again, until I got them in a good position, light stops when it runs into a barrier, and there are holes that can just take up all of your light.\n\n-Lights placed partially in the walls give of an equal preportion of light, so if you place it entirely in a wall, you just wasted a light, and you can't pick up your lanterns, so there isn't any way to fix this.\n\n-The ammount of lights you get are insufficient to light enough of the level to actually get through said level.\n\n-The music sounds peaceful, but it repeats and gets really annoying very quickly, especially if you're playing a really hard level. RageFuel isn't fun.\n\n-You can't see your endpoint, it's the same color as everything else.\n\n*********************************************************************************************************************\nSummary\n________________________________________________________________________________\nI could go on, but I'm going to save everyone some time and just cut it down to this, until this game gets a major revamp and fixes all of these problems above, it's not worth spending your time and money on it.

You also do not have to place all lamps right away.\nWith patience and careful planning, you will be able to get through each level.\nLevels are well-designed, and will give you that careful balance between "GAH!! I can't do it, I can't do it!" and "Oh, wait. Yes, I did do it. Oh awesome!"\n\nIt's really hard to describe the feeling.

It involves movement of structures and use of spikes that hinder your advance through the mazes. It comprises of 20 levels and I can say that they are fairly challenging, especially the levels through 10 - 15 which almost made me get a new keyboard because of the smashing it had to go through. In conclusion a good game for a challenge especially the levels I mentioned and helps in coordination skills.
