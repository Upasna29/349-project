There are 6 possible endings though, so there is definitely replay value for you adventure hunters out there. Personally, I liked it, the art style was nice, the music was gorgeous and I felt the voice acting really gave it a more human touch.\n\nIt may not be for everyone as it’s clean (no sexual content) and is surprisingly deep at times (the tone is light at the beginning but becomes a bit heavier as the story progresses).\n\nRecommended 7 out of 10\n","April 8","true","1.9"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","1"

Not like a lot of the other ones I have played in the past, not at all, and I like that a lot. We are presented with a protagonist who is seemingly a very normal man, a salesman in the steel pipes business, this is clearly done to show us that he’s an everyman that any of us can identify with. The story is about him meeting up with a lost love on a business trip and depending on what your decisions are during the trip, different outcomes happen. Now this is not a surprise as that is what Visual Novels are about, the surprising bit is how staunch and strong the ideals and views of the characters are. In this type of “pretty” VN you’d rarely get characters that have such definite ideals and convictions, and for me that makes this a real diamond in the rough. I applaud the developers and publishers for publishing such a game, as I know many studios may feel that it would be quite risky to do so.\n\nAs for production values it seems nice enough and a lot of the other reviewers have already touched on that so I don’t want to repeat what they’ve said. One of the other reviewers said she found a bug in the game but I’ve had a few playthroughs and so far nothing! Maybe the developers already fixed it!","April 10","true","3.9"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Too many problems with this, the first being the ridiculous audio settings..  The first problem is the audio.  Unless you turn the music all the way down to 0%, the music is way too loud compared to the voice volume, even if you max out the voice.  Ugh.\n\nWatch my "Let's Play" and Review of this game right here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJK4sxPmpo8\n\nThe second problem is the voice acting is terrible.  When you hear a totally fake cry, it just comes off really cheesy.\n\nBut my main problem with this game is the super simple, forced plot that doesn't make you feel anything or care about the character(s) in the story.  It's a rushed, super cheesy plot and just feels "wrong" and "rushed" in every way.\n\nThe game was left running accidently while I was afk after I completed the whole game, and one play through the game will likely take you somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes.  It's not a long virtual novel at all.\n\nThere's no excuse for a visual novel like this that they ask any amount of money for feeling so shallow and "rushed".  To compare, the visual novel "The Sad Story of Emmeline Burns" is FREE right here on Steam, and is about ten times better then this game.\n\n1 out of 10.  Not Recommended.","April 8","false","1.7"," 33 of 62 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","33","62","2","8"

I guess it can’t be helped if stupid weeaboos who enjoy cookie cutter plots and waifus don’t appreciate it though. I enjoyed how realistic it was, though the game does get a bit political at times and I can see why that may offend some. Fortunately it agreed with my political views, so I’m happy!","April 9","true","5.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","7","12","6","0"

Lack of skipping makes even trying to go back to where you were really tedious.\n\nHaven't seen a game as unpolished as this in a while...","April 8","false","3.1"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","12","24","0","1"

It is really cheesy, but I think cheesy is kind of cute =)\nI wish there was more to it, it took me about half an hour to play through, I do like short novels but not for this price.\nAnd I wish I could connect to the character more, more backstory to WHO you are. I know it really tried through dialogue, but maybe a little more would really help.\n\nVoice Acting: The lady in the beginning the receptionist, her voice is cute =)\nI know my voicing was dramatic, and it was done to suit the theme, like in anime (which I am used to VA anyway)\nVisual Novel = Drama :P\n\nMusic: Yes. I love the music, soundtrack suits the scenes, but I wish there was more variety.\n\nWorth 3.99? Eh. 6/10 I'd try it. 6 endings. I  ran away with Tara woohoo <3 love forever","April 8","true","0.8"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","12","24","0","0"
