You can hardly make it worse in a re-edition.\n\nAnd the Remastered edition is actually quite nice - as long as your new PC complies with rather too high Minimum requirements.\nThe textures of all characters looks fine now, and the game could be actually played with a mouse (although you do get an achievement for beating it the good old way).  The developers' commentaries are subtitled, and in all six languages the remake supports.\n\nSo, arguably the best adventure game of all times is even better now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheeseness/recommended/316790/","cheeseness","Cheeseness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheeseness/","533 products in account","1998 was a pretty significant year for many gamers on many platforms. Half-Life, StarCraft, Thief, Unreal, Descent: Freespace, Heart of Darkness, Metal Gear Solid, Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines, Ocarina of Time, Baldur's Gate, SoulCalibur and Spyro all made their debuts this year, raising the bar for their respective genres. For Linux gamers, Loki Software was founded, and our friends at LinuxGames[linuxgames.com] launched their site.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRB6Likh478\n\nToday, one title that holds its own amongst these classics was released for Linux. LucasArts' acclaimed film noir styled take on Aztec afterlife and underworld mythology, Grim Fandango, has been released today for Linux, Mac OS and Windows, making the game commercially available for the first time in nearly two decades.\n\nBeyond being published during a cool year, Grim Fandango stands out for its strong characterisation, engaging story and sweet tank controls (people hate this now, but I don't remember anybody at the time thinking it was terrible), and has received widespread recognition as one of the most significant adventure games ever made.\n\n\nGrim Fandango tells the tale of Manuel Calavera, a travel agent for the Department of Death, who finds himself embroiled in a conspiracy as he attempts to save an innocent traveler from a dangerous journey across the Land of the Dead. Grim Fandango exposes some of the most cinematic storytelling ever realised in a game at the time, and garnered almost immediate recognition from critics.\n\nIn addition to being the recipient of numerous awards[en.wikipedia.org] and being included in a huge number of lists of important/good/noteworthy/loved games since its release, the game has maintained a strong fan base and carved out a special place in the hearts of many players (check out page three of The International House of Mojo's Secret History article on Grim Fandango[mixnmojo.com] for a nice collection of fan thoughts - in fact, check it all out, it's a good article), leading to a community developed engine replacement, a graphical modernisation overhaul, fan movies, stop motion reproductions, and more.\n\nGrim Fandango is also often noted for how well its visuals have aged compared to other titles of similar vintage. Rather than striving for realism, Peter Tsaykel and his team worked with the limitations of the technology at the time by creating low polygon characters styled after skeletal calaca figurines (which play a role in the Día de los Muertos[en.wikipedia.org] celebrations that the game draws upon).\n\n\nOriginally posted by Tim Schafer:I mean that's actually the genesis of Grim Fandango. 3D art had just started, but a lot of us didn't want to use it because we thought 2D art was so much better-looking at the time. I thought 3D characters in real time looked like a nylon stocking stretched over a bunch of cardboard boxes duck-taped together.\n\nBut when I was looking at the Dios de Los Muertos, I noticed they built the skeletons as these solid tube-shaped bodies with the ribcage painted on. And I thought, what does that remind me of? It was like cheap texture mapping. It's made to be mass-produced and built really quickly and so it's perfect for rudimentary 3D engines and stuff. (source[www.gamestudies.org])\n\nGrim Fandango Remastered aims to be a work of preservation first and foremost, presenting the game in its original form (that includes its original 4:3 aspect ratio) along with some small enhancements. New dynamic lighting and self-shadowing helps place characters within the game's scenes in ways that were less achievable at the time of the original release, and the game's 3D elements are rendered at native resolution now, giving them a crispness that compensates (and perhaps overcompensates) for the initial version's contrast between low resolution real time characters and higher fidelity pre-rendered backgrounds. There are also some more subtle changes, such as high resolution textures that re-create the original textures' characteristics whilst not being limited to the same colour palette constraints.\n\nThe game's award winning soundtrack has been re-recorded by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (who also performed Broken Age's score), adding some extra depth to the game's soundscape, and polishing up some rough edges under the direction of the game's original composer, Peter McConnell.\n\nThe input system has been given an overhaul, with scene relative movement controls (rather than the beloved tank controls) being the default for keyboard and gamepad play, and a new mouse interface which allows the game to be played as a traditional point and click adventure. This feature comes less than a year after community modder Tobias Pfaff released a point and click interface for Grim Fandango running under ResidualVM (it's worth noting that Tobias was credited as a consultant for Grim Fandango Remastered and spent time in the Double Fine offices assisting with the project).\n\nThe game also features developer commentary, a concept art browser and the ability to toggle between old and new rendering modes.\n\nIf you're looking for a remake or a reimagining, then Grim Fandango Remastered isn't for you. It's the 1998 experience with a little extra shine, plus some additional insight into its development. Grim Fandango Remastered is now available for Linux on Steam, GOG[www.gog.com] and the Grim Fandango Remastered[grimremastered.com] website (via Humble widget).\n\nI still play through the game every couple of years, and even with that level of familiarity, I can't help but worry about Meche, grin at Glottis' indomitable spirit, root for Manny, and get swept up in this tale of corruption in the Land of the Dead. Grim Fandango is captivating in ways that few games have been before or since, and Manny's journey unveils a rich world filled with memorable and believable characters whose comings and goings feel like they mean something - their hopes, aspirations, tragedies and victories touch Manny and through him, they touch us.\n\n\nThis is a piece of gaming history and heritage that I'm glad to be able to share with Linux users, and I hope that the remastered edition ensures its longevity and accessibility for a long time to come though both its current availability and by inspiring projects like ResidualVM[residualvm.org] and Grim Fandango Deluxe[grimfandangodeluxe.blogspot.com] to continue and grow.\n\n\n¡Viva la Revolución!\n\n(I originally published this review on the 27th of January 2015 at GamingOnLinux.com)","January 28, 2015","true","11.9"," 314 of 367 people (86%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","86","314","367","17","0"

My next pick was Grim Fandango.\n\nNot being subjected to point & click adventure games in my formative years or the adventure genre in general, to be honest, I am only now discovering these gems that once flew past me. FPS is more my cup of tea, but I'm learning, slowly. Grim Fandango is a genius blend of film noir elements and the Aztec/Mexican view of afterlife. Casablanca meets Beetlejuice, was my first impression, though stylistically it's closer to Tim Burton's and Henry Selick's stop-motion animated films. After beating Grim Fandango, I'll have to move The Book of Life higher up on my list of films to watch.\n\nBeing someone with a relatively short fuse for puzzle solving, I sought after guides probably sooner than I should've, since almost all of them can be solved by using the organ which resides in your skull, but since I am lazy I used guides quite a lot and it would be hypocritical of me to suggest that You shouldn't. That said, I failed to make such associations as freezing vomit with liquid nitrogen, or that I was even in need of these components. So I'm not sure how I would've gotten past that point without a guide. I can probably offer other far fetched puzzles as examples, but I loved this game, so I won't. Not noticing a deadbolt in an open door still has me too embarrassed, so pay attention to what you can interact with.\n\nI experienced very few technical issues and I wasn't bothered by the fact that the character models seemed to be the main focus in this Remaster. There was a case where Manny's head disappeared for a short time, which would be more out of place in other games and also a moment where Manny and Glottis got stuck to each other. Nothing else comes to mind.\n\nTo spoil the humor in many of the great moments found in Grim Fandango would be very wrong of me, but it's no doubt one of the funniest games I've ever played and I would dare to say one of the greats in all aspects. Grim Fandango is not to be ignored, when it's basically delivered to your doorstep, not some rarity locked far away in physical form, most likely already used and possibly not able to run on modern operating systems. I cherish the moments when my laziness is rewarded.","November 15, 2015","true","13.3"," 94 of 107 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","94","107","8","1"

Needless to say, I was among the many adventure gamers that played the 1998 original and fell in love with it. Thanks to the unbearable rush of ordinary adult life, I've just recently found the time to play this masterpiece again.\n\nI remember my purchase of the game in year 2000; being curious at first, amazed as I played and stubborn enough to finish it in a week without a break. I was twelve years old back then, without a reach for any kind of guide and with a somewhat broken English nonetheless. I was carefully listening to every word coming out of Manny's mouth, trying to understand and consult a dictionary when needed. Faced with its nonlinear story triggers and puzzle system, getting stuck was part of my routine with the game. Luckily, I had an older cousin who played before, so I pestered him to give me hints till the end. Without him, I'd be on the same game for a month probably. That's how hard it was, and that's how intriguing it was: that it made a twelve year old girl's resolve to complete the game invincible.\n\nWelcome to the Land of the Dead. Our protagonist is Manuel Calavera, a grim reaper and a travel agent of the Department of Death, who sells travelling packages to the souls of the deceased for their last journey and passage to the Ninth Underworld. Manny is an extraordinary character; with sharp wits, a great sense of humor and a keen business sense. He works for the Department, hoping to make enough sells to pay off his debts and earn his last journey to the Ninth someday. Everything starts as a random office intrigue as Manny tries to steal a client from his coworker and arch nemesis, Domino Hurley. He meets with elegant and saintly Mercedes "Meche" Colomar, and gets involved in a shady plot concerning the very department he works for. There begins Manny's long, long journey to help Meche, help himself and many others in the process.\n\nLet's start with visuals, shall we? This remastered version most certainly tweaked character models and textures, so characters themselves look great in modern systems compared to the original. You'll be delighted to meet many interesting and well enacted characters in the shape of calaca dolls, inspired from the Mexican Day of the Dead celebrations. Environment design and the atmosphere harbors beautiful architecture, artistic backgrounds and a unique world that comes out of 1930s taste and class. The setting is elaborate, fascinating, funny and sometimes even a bit disturbing. Many gamers complained that background artworks were not tweaked much and seemed a bit aging in modern systems, but that certainly didn't bug me. They are still very beautiful. The soundtrack on the other hand - an incredible original selection that combines orchestral score, South American folk music, jazz, bebop, swing, and big band music - has been completely rerecorded with a full orchestra just for the remastered experience. As a fair warning, 16.9 aspect ratio image doesn't work. You'll be stuck with 4.3 and there will be decorated gray bars residing on the sides of your screen while you play the game.\n\nThe gameplay uses either P&C controls or tank controls of the original game, according to your choice. Manny's inventory system has always been a bit lame, but it doesn't take much effort to pull a certain item from your coat pocket. As expected from the nature of an adventure game, you are to speak to people, combine items and solve puzzles to progress. With the new rendering of items, there is no pixel hunt. It's quite obvious when an item or a piece of an environment can be used. Puzzles on the other hand - well, there is no hand holding. Do not expect a hint system. This game stands here as a piece of gaming history. Puzzles are mostly difficult, yet imaginative with exceptional conclusions and the story revelation is never linear. If this is your first time playing the game, you might find it helpful to keep a guide open in the Steam overlay. There are reports of bugs in the forums but I haven't encountered any in my playthrough. Oh, and there is no auto saving feature either so remember keeping many save files.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is not a remake. This is a well-done remaster of a classical, even a masterpiece of an adventure game. If you haven't experienced Grim Fandango yet, this is an unmissable opportunity for anyone who enjoys the genre. The game has an incredible story, strong characters, marvelous setting, beautiful display and a really challenging gameplay with noir sense of humor.

I used to have just a shoebox with jewel cases of games I'd play, maybe 10 at most. So I would get into the habit of replaying the games I had to try and still get enjoyment out of them. One of those games I grew up with was Grim Fandango.\n\nGrim Fandango I would say is the game that had the single biggest influence on my life. Its colorful cast of characters who all develop very nicely as the game goes on, a story of adventure and romance, its influences from very old films and comic books. Everything about Grim Fandango appealed to me as a kid, and greatly shaped my tastes in movies and music as I grew older. I remembered literally all of the puzzle solutions, the dialogue, the soundtrack. Everything came rushing back like a torrent of nostalgia, clear as a bell like the day I first played it.\n\nNaturally I'm not here to gush about the 1998 release, which runs like crap on modern computers. I'm here to talk about this re-release.\n\nThe re-release of Grim Fandango is a bit... mixed. I was surprised as hell when I heard it was being made, I had long resigned myself to running the game in a virtual machine with countless bugs and other issues. However as much as I do like the work that went into optimizing this game to run properly, I still feel like they should've gone the extra mile and remade the game in full 3D. Since they didn't, it's recommended to play in 4:3 due to the flat 2D environments. The 15$ price tag can also turn people off if they're not interested in playing adventure games.\n\nThere are problems with the re-release that I think could have been avoided. The point and click interface while extremely well designed, I feel could have been tweaked a little. The menu interface is a bit static and the audio commentary feels very impersonal and doesn't go into as much depth as I would've liked. The game also lacks an auto save feature which is shocking in this day and age.\n\nBut all that aside it's still a delightful game, and a very playable one on this port. I'm glad it got re-released, but to be honest I just think Grim Fandango deserves more.","September 10, 2015","true","6.7"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","45","50","0","1"

There are tons of guides out there. Why you should read mine? I had beat the old version of this video-game around 8 times. Also, I damn love Grim Fandango. Trust me, you will get good info on this one.\n\nThis game is one of those that catch your soul and your heart and attach to it like if it will never let you go. It's like if this game eat your soul, but in a good way. In this video-game you are in the shoes of Manuel “Manny” Calavera. You are a travel agent that work for a company called the DOM “Department of the Death” right at the Land of the Death, and your mission is to sell the best commission to the people that came right after death. The objective is to give to each person what deserves for being good or bad in life. The good people go to heaven, but things change when you discover a conspiracy behind the DOM and you meet Mercedes “Merche” Colomar. The world as Manuel Calavera knows it changes forever. Grim Fandango it's a game that contains amazing art, and incredible story and a very fun gameplay.\n\nFirst, the artists behind this video-game are people that put everything, the best of them to make this video-game possible. Most of them, like most game developers, worked all night to get things done. Passionate people that loved what they were doing and constantly challenged themselves to achieve greatness. The art of Grim Fandango has mixtures of Mexican, Aztec and South American art. It is really interesting to see what the artists did based on that cultures and locations over the world. The scenarios are amazing, the characters are really good developed, and every one of them has a unique personality. This game really feels like an entire new world after the meaning of death. The most exciting thing of this video-game is to discover new places as you progress through the story. It is an amazing feeling to see the new places and its art on each one. This game also is inspired artistically and historically from the famous event from Mexico. "The Day of the Death" which happens on the 2nd of November. If you have an opportunity to travel to Mexico someday. Go for this date and see for yourself the incredible festivities that people do over there. That's a really special day for Mexicans, including me as being Mexican. Now, talking about the Remastered version. This Remaster is really well done, this one has done a pretty good job on remaking the textures to higher resolutions, and fixing the illumination of several characters. The environment looks better in my opinion. Some areas look like the same, but those still today look really well made. It is a little bit hard to detect if there were changes on the environment, but the remastered characters are an instant visual change. Also, the player is able to see the old version by pressing the "backspace" key while in-game. I remember that It doesn't look really fair when you press that key because on my old version. I remember to get textures, and a detail close to the remastered version. Close, but not really like that. It's like the backspace key loads a super low resolution showing you the worst of it. But the Remaster definitely looks great. I love it. Just to finish in this part. I own the 1998 version of Grim Fandango, so I can remember pretty well how it looks.\n\nSecond, the story is amazing. It is one of those kind of stories that you wish never ends. In the moment that this story ends, you feel like you want more, but at same time you feel really satisfied with what you went through in this game. Tim Shafter made a really incredible story on this one. It feels like every developer behind this game, from the music to scripting shared a piece of themselves on the final product. This is a spoiler free review of the story. There is an interesting thing about the story, and it is that it feels like it never lacks anything. It has everything one can wish from a really good story. This sentence may differ from a ton of people, but this game don’t was GOTY just because. Also, it contains several references to different noir movies. If you are into a lot of movies of the Noir genre, you will catch a lot of references. The conspiracy feeling, the curiosity and the excitement are always there on this video-game. It is a really well made story. I don't know if I will experiment a video-game like this in the future, but this one stays on my list of favorite video-games of all time.\n\nThird, the gameplay is fun. I like how it is done. There are several control options right now on the Remastered version, but I love to play it at the old style with Tank Controls. The inventory system is super easy. The player goes around the game while recollecting items to accomplish several puzzles. Sometimes the player needs to use certain item more than once to achieve a goal and complete a puzzle. In this game you can run, walk, interact with items, characters and the environment itself. The player can talk to different characters and use several dialogue options to interact with them. Also, this remastered version comes with Steam achievements which makes the replay value to increase a lot from where it was, and it was high. Sometimes it is good to catch a good guide to move forward, because some puzzles are really tricky. Some of those need the player to move to different areas or scenes to accomplish an objective. It is also interesting how every year of the game is made. There are a lot of areas in every year. It almost feels like a small open world video-game. It has limitations, but some of this places are huge, especially in year 2. The interesting thing is how the player keeps to see new and new content over the progress. It doesn't felt repetitive, it doesn't felt recycled. It feels and plays good.\n\n-Inventory System: The player can access the inventory pressing “I” as the default key, and there you choose between multiple items with the left and right arrows. Then, the player selects and item and press “enter” to get it. Finally, the player to get rid of the item needs to press “P” as the default key.\n-Tank Controls: This option is a kind of heavy movement. It don’t allows you to move in a fast way. In this case to describe it better it's that the camera don’t moves with you, but you move with the camera. You can see the X scene but you can walk through it only, no camera movement.\n\nFinally, Grim Fandango it's one of those games that catch yourself over the gameplay, the story and its art while making you feel welcome to play it. This was released for the first time in 1998 and the Remastered version was released this year in 2015. A final point to analyze is that you don't need residual VM to play Grim Fandango anymore. This plays well on the new systems. It runs flawlessly on Windows 8.1. Amazing job!\n\nI really apologize for my bad English. I did this review in English and not in Spanish to reach more people.

Nothing else to add to that. What I'm going to focus on this tiny bit of text floating on the internet is how good is this "remastered" edition. Read further if you want to know more!\n\nThe good:\nIt's Grim Fandango! I never got to experience this game when it released but even over a decade later I finally got to try it and I love it. It's a classic for a reason and I still have memories of seeing this game plastered all over PC magazines for the graphics it had. People didn't believe how good a game could be and Grim Fandango showed them how a great adventure game is done.\n\nThe music. This game has some of the best music I've heard and it's performed by talented artists and the orchestral music alone is what makes this game a buy. Every other screen you traverse has it's own music and it really helps set the mood perfectly. It's just beautiful, man.\n\nIt's an actual game. I give some adventure games like The Walking Dead and Wolfing Down Cartoon Street a slack for not being actual games, more like interactive cartoon series. This however feels like an actual adventure game. Most likely because it was made a few decades ago for a different audience but it does feel it's age once you find yourself stuck on some parts that aren't clear cut. However you cut it Grim Fandango is what an adventure game should be and it saddens me that this genre has been lost to the ages that we find ourselves just hugging the oldies for good quality experiences.\n\nBrilliant voice acting. It's cartoonish but spot on. You might notice some voices you've heard on your old sunday cartoons in it but over all everyone in the game gives a great performance. Despite made out only bones and marrow these characters feel more alive than many others that are delivered with flat performances. If voice actors had performances to imitate and work from, this could be something they'd check out.\n\nRefreshing re-release. It's nice to see an old classic dug up sometimes and given a bath. Nothing is vastly changed and many things feel just lightly touched on. You don't have to reinvent the wheel if it works and I think this version shouts that out well.\n\nThe bad:\nThere's no title screen. I know the original didn't have one since if it did then this would too, since you're forced to pretty much watch the opening sequence before you can hit ESC to finally start fine tuning things like resolution, volumes and settings. If the idea of a re-release is to improve upon the old it makes no sense that there is no start up menu. I suppose it makes sense not to have a start up menu in a game that is only really worth playing through once but the thing is there is one! You have to access it via hitting ESC so I really don't get it why that wasn't the initial screen from the start. Not to mention once you finish the game it simply restarts itself and I can't help but to feel this was an oversight.\n\nNot really remastered. The 3D models have been upressed yes but the backgrounds look like they've hardly been touched at all. Not to mention no additional polygons for the most part and some items that looked shoddy still look shoddy. You can easily switch back and forth between the original and remastered and I can understand why the remastered version looks much like the original: because they didn't want to remake the entire game, animations and cut scenes a like. This severily makes this version feel cheap and hardly worked on but you could say it's to pay homage to the original, or whatever, but to me it just seems lazy. The entire fact that some backgrounds have this weird blur-effect-done-quick in Photoshop and then suddenly an animation kicks in and it looks like the old pixelated game while an "HD" version of the protagonist stands there next to it just looks pretty darn awful and out of place. I know this game is old but if you're going for a re-release for a well loved title then you could do it more justice. At least they didn't add "HD" at the end of the game so it's not that big of a crime I suppose.\n\nMouse controls. This is a bad thing you ask? Not the controls themselves but the sub menus you access. There are a few hidden easter eggs for instance that you will miss entirely if you use the mouse exclusively like for instance trying to "pick up" an NPC will trigger a pick up line with said character or a funny moment. I don't understand why it's hidden and even some of the game's lines are missed entirely if you don't actually use the keyboard. For instance some locations have descriptions to them that Calavera explains, but you won't know that since the sub menus are lacking in said function, especially when moving from screen to screen! You can literally try and pick up and examine everything but the mouse controls won't tell you that. However on certain things like examing distant objecs is now easier with the mouse. Again overall this just looks bad for this re-release but seems easily fixable though: just add in the missing functions to everything!\n\nIn short:\nAll in all I recommend it, because it simply is a great game! Some mild frustrations here and there with the lack of polish and not really being a fully remastered release but the price isn't that high either. Expect to beat it in less than 10 hours if you're a veteran to adventure games but if you aren't you might find yourself coming back to it with new ideas on how to solve puzzles! Or you could just look it up you cheap cheater!","February 13, 2015","true","15.1"," 40 of 54 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","40","54","0","0"

I have been waiting for the remaster for years, since it's so hard to run the game nowadays with an old copy. Mouse options and two different settings for walking (Getting people to try out this game was so hard in the past due to tank controls!)\n\nCONS: This looked like such a promising port, but honestly, it's a mess. I can't for the life of me get audio skipping to stop, even after limiting the frame rate. People are having trouble getting it to work in general, and those who are successful are dealing with a slew of technical problems. This is not much of a remaster, as the graphics have remained almost entirely the same. I would have loved to see good texture updates, but even those on the characters are weak. Cutscenes are covered in ugly static and are crunched up CG. Why in god's name is this in a remaster? Backgrounds have not been updated at all... Why?\n\nWORTH: It's tough to speak on its worth because it's simultaneously such a great game yet also a bad port. You can return, so try it out yourself and see if your system has similar issues.\n\nOVERALL: Grim Fandango deserved better than this rushed mess. I sincerely hope for a patch to fix all these issues. This game means a lot to me, and I'd love to see it fully-funcitoning! I've chosen to reserve judgement on a score for now, and wait to see if a patch comes out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/316790/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","Buenos días desde la Tierra de los Muertos!\n\nGrim Fandango is an adventure game by Tim Schafer back from when was working for LucasArts in the ‘90s and it is widely considered to be the swansong of the genre. Many years later, Schafer’s own company, Double Fine, finally brings it back “from the dead” (pun intended maybe?) in the form of a Remastered edition after the original was not legally available anywhere for a very long time (you know, they stopped manufacturing retail boxes). So, what is all the fuss about Grim Fandango?\n\nWell, when someone gets asked what is so great about Grim Fandango, they always pinpoint the quality of the writing firstly (or I would hope so). Tim Schafer’s writing excels in this game, as proven by a narrative full of clever and witty dialogues from well fleshed out characters. Now, the plot in Grim Fandanago is unquestionably one of those which should not be spoiled, but a synopsis can be given. Consequently, the plot essentially spans four years, each representing a separate chapter respectively.  It starts off with the protagonist, Manny Calavera, a travel agent at the Department of Death getting fed up one day of dealing with not-so-great clients (ie. evil souls) and eventually steals a client, Mercedes Colomar, from his rival, Domino Hurley, who strangely always seems to get the best clients (ie. pure souls). Despite her being a pure soul, Manny mistakenly assigns her on a four-year journey to the afterlife, as all the evil souls are meant to, instead of the luxury express train due to a rigged database. With that, it is not long before Manny figures out that something fishy is happening in this department, and as a result finds out of the wicked scam. So he sets off to look for Mercedes and put a stop to this. In these four years, Manny faces a handful of challenges and meets many odd, but lovely, individuals. Admittedly, the quality of the plot, while still overall commendable though, peaks at the end of Year 2; with the subsequent two years being both less captivating and shorter in length, clocking up to a total of 10-11 hours of gameplay.\n\nThe entire Aztec themes with the calaca-like characters and the Day of the Dead inspirations, in addition to the film-noir vibe and Art Deco designs, are only some of the few things that make Grim Fandango’s world so exceptionally unique and memorable. Then there is the excellent voice acting and soundtrack to back it up. Having various Latino actors featured in the cast clearly helps cement the authenticity of the aforementioned themes. Moreover, the performances are so spot on, there is hardly a time when you are taken out of the immersion. Now, the soundtrack is splendid and, much like the voice acting, fits with the game’s themes too. It mixes genres such as South American folk music, swing, bebop and jazz all together. Peter McConnell did a brilliant job back then and does it, once again, by re-recording all those tracks for the Remastered edition. This soundtrack is one worth owning alone.\n\nThe original gameplay involved using tank controls exclusively, but now that is not the case anymore with the implementation of straightforward point-and-click mechanics in the Remastered edition. Much like any adventure game from that time period, the player must collect objects that can be used with other collectibles, people or environments in order to solve the puzzles and progress the story. The inventory system involves pulling each item in and out of Manny’s coat jacket for use or inspection. This makes an interesting spin on the inventory system, although the problem with this, compared to the classic hover tab, is that it is a bit more time consuming looking for the right item since you cannot go straight to the desired item right away. Manny has to pull in and out each item in turn. Puzzle-wise, Grim Fandango has an adequate level of difficulty in general when you put the effort to be observant. Nevertheless, and it is sad to say, there are moments when their logic jumps the shark, leaving the player clicking on everything and backtracking a lot in hopes of finding the right solution. Thankfully, the last two chapters are a bit smaller in number of places to visit, thus making the backtracking less prominant. Retrospectively, a couple of puzzle designs have aged badly and they sure would put off newcomers. Even veterans of the genre would rightfully complain and be annoyed. I did as well, at least in three instances.\n\nVisually, being the first 3D adventure game by LucasArts, Grim Fandango looks all blocky and with muddy backgrounds by today’s standards. Artistically, there is nothing wrong with that, and perhaps the somewhat cartoon-ish appearance might give it an excuse to bypass this flaw. The Remastered edition tries to fix this by improving the character models and the engine shaders, but only does the job partially.  Undoubtedly, the best part of the remastered port is being able to run the game on modern machines without fiddling with emulators.\n\nIf there are certain aspects to be nitpicky about though, these would indeed be related to the state of the port. As mentioned previously, whilst the character models were vastly improved through the use of enhanced textures, better cast of lighting and anti-aliasing for jagged edges, the backgrounds were left shockingly untouched. Even though they are not completely ugly, it would have been ideal to give them the same treatment as the character models since a lot of Grim Fandango’s unique charm comes from the world design. Then there is also the stability of the port as many people have reported being buggy. In my case, I have never encountered any game-breaking bugs which would prevent my progress, or any bug for that matter. However, one observation that I would like to point out is that there were, in my playthrough, severe drops in framerate during pre-rendered cutscenes causing them to be laggy on a arguably modern machine. Looking around, I think there is a conflict with the Steam overlay as I also noticed dialogues began to temporarily stutter after I would return from the Steam overlay.\n\nIn conclusion, Grim Fandango is a title absolutely worth to be called a classic and definitely amongst the best adventure games. As of now, almost two decades since its original release, it still remains one of the most original concepts in a video game to date. Even if certain puzzles might have aged badly since then, everything else from the narrative, distinctive characters, well-written conversations, stellar voice performances to the splendid soundtrack create this unforgettable ride. Now the Remastered Edition, on the other hand, is admittedly a tad lazy as not everything is in actual fact fully “remastered”; not that Double Fine ever claimed that. The counterargument for this would be that it is more of a case of preserving a lost classic by retaining its original aesthetics and feel as much as possible and making only small visual and technical enhancements where was necessary without ruining the original vision of the game. Ultimately it is up to you to contemplate this practice all you want, but at the end of the day this is still the same Grim Fandango as many people remember from ’98 -- a game I highly recommened to any adventure fan, at very least for the originality of the concept.","January 27","true","10.4"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","1"

I never could have hoped for new release. But we got it and even with some extras!\n\nGrim Fandango is a humorous film noir adventure/puzzle game by Lucas Arts. It has superb writing in dialogue, story and characters. Really classy soundtrack with some swinging jazzy tunes. Challenging puzzles. With some of them too challenging and bit out there. Sometimes player would just go on trying everything on everything and succeed, then not having idea what he/she just did and why. There is no hint system built in on the game, so googling a walkthrough might come in handy to some less seasoned adventurers. Nobody should abandon the game just because they can't progress, they would miss on a great adventure.\n\nThe Remastered version added upgraded grapichs (you can change to the original with just press of a button), rerecording of the soundtrack with Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, mouse and gamepad controls, insightful commentary track and good amount of original concept art.\n\nUnfortunately they also launched the game with quite an amount of bugs and glitches which they have been patching ofcourse. Personally I was affected by the bug that made all the backgrounds in remastered mode black, so I played most of the game with old graphics. Also there was maybe 3 or 4 crashes on my playtrough. As I also mentioned that there was no hint system in place, I think that's something they could have added. Maybe slip it in the devs commentary track?\n\nOverall Grim Fandango is still a great atmospheric experience with great art design, remaster making it even sweeter.\n\n[Score: 90]","February 10, 2015","true","14.5"," 36 of 50 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","36","50","2","0"

If you've never played it and always wanted, get it.\n\nNow, to call this a Remaster is a bit of a stretch, i'd call it a Cash-grab.\n\nTo be honest, i got it just so i could play Grim Fandango without compatibility issues, but it still upsets me that they're selling the same game again while all the "special" features are just lazy and perfectly complete the ruining of the Monkey Island and the story of a 3.3 million dollar man.\n\nFirst of all, all cutscenes are the exact same as they were in the original, low-res, flattish and that special 90s kind of 3D.\nThis wouldn't be so bad, but it's jarring when they use it ingame, as part of a scene, when a perfectly crisp character suddenly becomes pixelated and covered in jpeg artifacts.\n\nSecond of all, ALL of the backdrops and static images are the EXACT SAME as they were in the original, yes this means they're low-res, low-quality mess, which would be fine years ago, but not fitting the "Remastered" title at all.\nLook at recently released Resident Evil, which is a port of a Remastered edition. All of the backdrops are done from scratch, not to mention every aspect of the game improved.\n\nThe only part that's redone is the character textures, but being so simplistic, i don't see how that is an achievement.\n\nNow, let's move on to another "special" feature and that is lighting effects. It sounds cool right. Even looks good at Mannys office, but the second you step out of the first scene, it all falls apart.\nNow you see, as almost any old game, Grim Fandangos character models are mostly a number of blocks and primitive shapes skinned to a skeleton, which, when used with proper shading technique, may look nice.\nNow, new special feature ♥♥♥♥ING MAKES EVERY DAMN BODY PART LIGHT UP AS A CHRISTMAS TREE, which is unspeakably amateurish, especially for a game studio like Double Fine.\n\nWell, use the "original" rendering, you might say. And i would've, but the "original" turns the rendering resolution all the way down to the original, so everything looks gloriously pixelated in the most widescreen possible way.\n\nSo if you're expecting the adventures of Manny Calaverea look as good as you fondly remember them to be - don't. It would've been fine if it looked dated but crisp and coherent, but it's not only not looking anything like that, but also manages to fail at looking even decent.\n\nGreat game ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Cashgrab Edition.","January 29, 2015","false","15.0"," 295 of 510 people (58%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","58","295","510","25","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/recommended/316790/","Cheesecake_Recipe","A Victim of Stars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/","882 products in account","In 1998, Grim Fandango released in a less than optimal climate. The gaming world was shifting away from the grand adventure, preferring more action than point and click titles could provide. Despite being universally loved by the press and longtime fans of the genre, fate pointed toward the exit and brought an end to an era of Lucasarts titles, effectively nailing the coffin shut on adventure games in general. It seemed a cruel way to go considering how loved it was. Lost in the Land of the Dead for 16 years thanks to a bad travel package, Grim Fandango is finally breathing fresh air again thanks to the efforts of Sony, Double Fine, and the rights holders sitting in the Disney fortress. Enter Grim Fandango Remastered, the first time the game’s been available for public consumption since it released.\n\nSlick-tongued protagonist Manuel “Manny” Calavera is an agent of the Department of Death, an organization that attempts to sell the recently deceased travel packages to expedite their journey to the final stop in the Aztecan afterlife. Manny’s numbers aren’t pulling quite what they should, and, in fear of his boss reenacting a scene from Glengarry Glen Ross on him, he decides to steal a high-profiting case from a co-worker. This action sends Manny down a path dripping with characters ripped straight from noir films, big-band jazz, and an overall scenario that was produced by people at their creative primes.\n\nGrim Fandango’s story and humor remain as strong as ever. Between the quick-witted quips, cheeky dialog choices, smooth voice acting, and immense respect for the game’s inspirations, it truly is worthy of the praise it has been given by anyone who played it. Take your time and talk to everyone you can. Exhaust every dialog option you can find. The end result is almost always laughter, thanks to a universal humor style that doesn’t lean on the grotesque or immature. In fact, fans who played when they were younger may find even more to love now that they’re older - a trick many well-loved cartoons use to appeal to a wide variety of ages. If you’re a parent looking for something to play with your kid, and you don’t mind the fact that the entire game is about death, you don’t have to worry about anything too inappropriate.\n\nAnd it’s a good thing that the humor holds up as well as it does, because ay caramba, the puzzles! Out of everything in Grim Fandango’s bag of tricks, this is the part that has aged the worst. While certainly not as awful as some of the stumpers that some of the game’s predecessors and contemporaries offered, players will likely be left scratching their heads as they try to wrap their head around some nonsensical solution to a problem. A good majority can be figured out using contextual clues dropped by other characters mid-conversation, but some require the player to really reach for a designer’s sadistic tendency to hide the one object they need in the absolute least likely place it would be, while requiring 15 steps to get there. I would heavily urge players to go without a guide if at all possible, but no one will blame you for getting tired of putzing around trying to solve a puzzle.\n\nThere’s been much debate among fans regarding the “remaster” part of this release. I myself truly wish that games such as this could be lovingly restored with gorgeous details, brought to life like a blu-ray transfer of a classic film. Between this and the Resident Evil REmake release, there are so many things one wishes could be done easily or cheap enough for the industry to pull off. Sadly, that sort of work just isn’t feasible. However, in doing so, Double Fine manages to avoid what many fans consider a sin: changing the visuals too much to appeal to players who simply want crisp presentation. The lossless originals of every background and video file have been dug up and put to use, every character’s textures have been recreated to give them a clean look, and, most interestingly of all, a new lighting engine aids the illusion of these characters moving around in pre-rendered spaces. It’s hardly perfect, and often times the quality between character models and backgrounds can be distracting, but it remains fully respectful of the original art. It is up to you to decide if this is enough work to warrant being called a remaster.\n\nA major point of contention for many fans, and what would become a running gag with Tim Schafer himself over the years, was Grim Fandango’s original control scheme. Since players complained about the tank controls used, the remaster also includes enhanced control schemes which are generally more ideal. I did run into some issues with the point & click style controls here and there. Clicking on one part of a screen would sometimes send Manny rushing off in the opposite direction. Certain puzzles felt exponentially more difficult due to the jittery movements in the point and click scheme. Players using a controller will likely not notice, but it’s worth a head’s up that, if you’re struggling with point and click, you shouldn’t be afraid to try your keyboard.\n\nGrim Fandango Remastered isn’t perfect. Some new bugs have been introduced, the remastered visuals are a little uneven, the new control schemes aren’t without fault, and the puzzles won’t likely be making many friends. But despite all of the stains all over its nice suit, it manages to outshine these tarnishes. The humor still holds a timeless quality that doesn’t feel like it came out of 1998, the story itself is still fresh and imaginative compared to the usual topics seen today. There’s heart behind every bit of the game, even when its characters ceased to have one. A recurring theme within Grim Fandango is that wherever Mr. Calavera goes, he ends up near the top. Grim Fandango Remastered shows us that, even though it’s been 16 years since he hit the scene, Manny’s still got it, residing as Head Honcho over not only other adventure game protagonists, but as the boss of a genre once considered as dead as himself.\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gao-Li/recommended/316790/","Gao-Li","Gao Li","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gao-Li/","192 products in account","9/10 A good remaster of one of the best adventure games ever to be released\nCalavera, Manuel Calavera, is the man. Lucas Arts’ Grim Fandango was one of the buggiest, yet most enjoyable adventure games when it first came out in 1998. You are playing as “Manny” Calavera, grim reaper and travel agent in the Eighth Underworld, sending the freshly deceased off to their journey to the Ninth Underworld. When Manny’s latest client, Mercedes “Meche” Colomar, basically a saint during her lifetime, strangely doesn’t qualify for the premium travel pack to the next Underworld, he uncovers a vile trail of corruption, deception, and murder in the Department of Death.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=646749941\n\nGrim Fandango takes inspiration from Aztec mythology and combines it with elements from film noir classics and bebop jazz music. And though highly acclaimed and often revered as a staple amongst video games, it fell flat with audiences at the time and Lucas Arts subsequently ceased to develop any further adventures, which is where this remastered version from 2015 steps in. Announced at Sony’s press event at E3 in 2014, this updated version was highly anticipated and generally well received with audiences.\n\nNew Features\nThe original release of Grim Fandango  had players control Manny via keyboard, while this newer version let’s players freely choose between using the gamepad, the keyboard, or the (for adventure games typical) mouse. Voice acting and subtitles for all major Western languages have also been included in this version and the models and light effects have all been refurbished, and players can not only switch between the original graphics and the updated ones (either by going into the menu or by pressing backspace on your keyboard), they can now also switch between a 4:3 and a stretched 16:9 aspect ratio at will. They will now also be able to switch between the original “tank control” scheme as well as modern control options; Other features include game’s design art and optional audio commentary from the developers. Most importantly, the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra lend their talents for the soundtrack of this new version.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=647426350\n\nDownsides and Issues\nWhat the game is definitely missing is a hint system, like the Special Editions of The Secret of Monkey Island (2009) and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge (2010), for the more difficult puzzles or whenever players get stuck. A feature that  Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards: Reloaded (2013) (cf. my review for it) was also missing. Unlike the original, the game also limits players to “only” four save states which is comparatively restrictive considering one major flaw in this release.\n\nAlthough I cannot deny how enjoyable the trip down memory lane and video game history is, the game could have done without the bugs. There were a few video sequences that would show a mainly black screen, unless one switched back to “Original Graphics” and for some players, some sections were unsolvable due to some errors. It is therefore advisable to save moderately frequently and use the different save states available.\n\nThe biggest issue with the game is that the pre-rendered story cutscenes from the original were not refurbished for this remastered version. When playing with the modern graphics, the switch to low resolution old graphics are definitely jarring at first and need getting used to.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=647426326\n\nConclusion Does Grim Fandango hold up?\n\nDefinitely, even the side characters, especially in Rubacava, are well rounded and the humor is spot on. If you’ve played the game before and sort of remember most of the solutions, you’ll be able to beat the game in about 10-12 hours, which makes it definitely worth the admission fee of US$15.\n\nLike most Lucas Arts’ adventure games it is impossible for the protagonist to die or fail, only for the player to get stumped by a puzzle. The new control schemes also even invites veterans to do things they might not have done back when the original was first released, like trying to show your inventory to other characters and hear their often very witty reactions or songs (in Year 3, for example).\n\nCan/should new players pick it up?\n\nYeah, if you’re a fan of adventure games, Grim Fandango is definitely a game worth playing. There are no puzzles that are simply meant to lengthen the playtime (like the three cups in Monkey Island 1 to break out that one prisoner), or puzzles with seemingly arbitrary solutions for the sake of having puzzles.\n\nThe inventory cannot be filled with unnecessary objects either. So, at any point you’ll only be able to pick up or have objects that you need for the current area. However, there are one or two puzzles that require you to pay attention to your surroundings. In Year 2, you should be aware of what the announcer in the arena says in order to solve a puzzle revolving around an incriminating photo. In Year 4, so as to understand the solution to the mug puzzle (despite being easy to solve due to the very small inventory in that section, some players didn’t understand why the solution was the way it was), you might want to recall what the pink maintenance demon said while repairing the server in Year 1.\n\nDoes it play on old computers?\n\nSurprisingly so. It even runs with 30fps on a 32-bit Windows Vista with a GeForce 9500 GT, an Intel Duo Core processor, and 3070MB RAM without any modifications.","March 18","true","10.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","6"

The world and writing are so incredible you’ll let any trial-and-error moments slide. The Remastered edition ensures that Grim can be played today, and the cool Developer’s Commentary and Mouse Controls/full controller support mean that even people like myself who have played Grim Fandango in 1999 still enjoy it fresh again. Not much has been done with the graphics other than a bit of widescreen adding and retexture 3d models but the lovely style the game has means that it doesn’t matter, and it still looks great anyway.\n\nyou want to experience the best storytelling in gaming, you need to play Grim Fandango if you never play it, and you have to buy this game If you played years ago like me.

Finally, the Remastered version came up on a nice sale so I bought it, and within minutes regretted it. The production is nice (although the remastering is barely worth calling attention to, espcially compared to another Lucasarts point-n-click's remastered, Monkey Island) but the game is unrewarding for its impossible-to-fathom puzzle solutions. It isn't even "try everything" which would be bad enough, but it's "try everything regardless of logic and then try a few more things after that and then it turns out you didn't realize the problem you were trying to solve in the first place because there's no obvious goals". Eventually, late in year one, I had to give up and find a walkthrough because I tried every obvious choice, then every non-obvious choice, and nothing even remotely gave me an idea of what I was trying to achieve, much less how to achieve it. You would have to be a mind-reader to figure some of this out. And some puzzles also force you to fight a dubious camera angle, "is that a cupboard or just a poster?" sort of things where you don't even know where to look for clues or items. The actual story was ok although not quite as rich as it felt like it was aiming for. This felt like a great universe to build a game from, but not even remotely a good game.","August 28, 2015","false","11.6"," 48 of 79 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","48","79","4","1"

But-one day- what simply started as an attempt to steal a client from his arrogant coworker soon turns into an epic journey through the Land of The Dead where Manny will discover the secrets behind the organization he's been working for.\nGrim Fandango has been crowned as one of the best adventure games ever made and, despite a few gripes with its gameplay and somewhat underwhelming remaster, it's still an essential purchase for fans of the genre.\n\nPROS:\n\n-excellent art style, the Day of the Dead influence is clear on characters and the various areas are still nice despite the aging graphics\n\n-great soundtrack\n\n-top notch voice acting\n\n-a varied cast of memorable characters, Manny Calavera himself is great with his mix of dark humour and serious morals\n\n-great story keeps you engaged with a mix of sudden twists and slow burn mysteries\n\n-lots of humour and funny dialogues will have you chuckle quite often\n\n-new point-and click-interface is a welcome addition\n\n-good length,expect at least 8/9 hours with 10/12 being the usual length if you explore a bit and/or get stuck at some puzzle\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n-I honestly found puzzles a bit of a mixed bag overall as some truly clever and fun ones are paired with others that require some weird logic, pixel hunting or are too vague: the fact you might lack a clear direction at times can also easily leave you stuck\n\nCONS:\n\n-the backgroud graphics and cinematics havn't aged too well and clearly show their age, you're also stuck with the 4:3 aspect ratio and bars at the side of the screen\n\n-there's still some serious bugs around, a few of them can leave the game stuck until you force quit it: saving often and on different slots is a necessity\n\n-some animations glitch the 3d model or skip frames altogether, nothing gamebreaking but it's distracting when it happens\n\n-tank controls feel awkward, same goes for inventory management\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=574629462\n\nLet's get this out of the way, Grim Fandango is an exceptional game and basically everyone'd play it at least once in his/her own life, period. It's not only an unique story populated by great characters and set in a memorable world but also an important piece of gaming history.\n\nThat said, its gameplay might frustrate some as the lack of hint system, vague directions, huge levels and sometimes cryptic puzzles can truly test your patience and leave you either using the "try every object on everything" approach or refer to a guide. Graphics show their age despite the 3d model overhaul but thankfully their gorgeous art is still as effective as it was back in '98. The few gamebreaking bugs are actually the worse offenders of the lot and it's a true shame no one bothered to fix them...I must say I was lucky enough to only meet one and it was easily bypassed with a forum search, still others wern't so lucky and if you forget to save often you might find yourself in dire straits.\n\nAll things considered Grim Fandango is an absolute recommendation despite its problems: just remember to save often, be ready to have patience with its puzzles and, if things get too frustrating, don't feel bad for using a guide if it means going forward with the story...it's worth it.\n","December 14, 2015","true","7.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

One of my favorite games growing up, Grim Fandango cleverly mixes Neo-Noir with Mexican/Aztec Folklore.  You play Manny Calavara, travel agent at the Department of Death.  You help the recently deceased get to where they need to go.  But not all is well in this town as Manny finds himself in the middle of conspiracy and corruption.  His ticket out of there is on the loose, and he needs to track her down.\n\nThe remastered version brings new high-res character textures, dynamic lighting, a live symphony orchestral soundtrack, dev commentary and the fact that it actually works on modern OS's.\n\nThe game is still 4:3, but you can stretch it to 16:9 as the backgrounds did not get remade (though not recommended).   The high-res character textures certainly bring Manny back to life, but perhaps don't do as much for secondary characters.\n\nThe real treat is getting to hear this fantastic soundtrack with a live symphony.  This is truely one of the all time greats, and it weaves in and out of the quirky visuals to deliver an immersive experience.\n\nMovie fans should take note of this game, as it mixes elements from classics like The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca with Brazil.\n\nIf you've played the original, this is worth picking up to relive the amazing soundtrack in its new life.\n\nIf you dont enjoy a slow paced game, or typical point & click puzzles, this may not be the game for you.\n\nTo see the game a little more before you buy it, you can check out my playthrough here\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWtNeqjluM0&list=PLZbmcHZ8TjKeZorXxcvTt3XHR0sosTo9G&index=1","January 27, 2015","true","16.8"," 30 of 50 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","30","50","2","0"

Tim demanded this achievement.\nOh Tim, Tim, Tim. A good game designer that still cares is trapped within you somewhere, but I don't know where it is these days. You make mediocre games that don't sell and try to appeal to an audience that doesn't play video games... as opposed to when you made amazing games that didn't sell and appealed to people that did play and enjoy games, but just like the people that post on Neogaf, you're a full blown cuck now that doesn't care anymore, cashing in on subpar concepts, selling them, then quickly abandoning them when you don't see profit. You've become the thing you've hated: A cold and calculating robot businessman that wants to sell products rather than make art.\n\nTim Schafer is the best possible example of the old adage about never meeting your heroes, cause you'll just meet hack frauds.\n\nSpeaking of hack frauds, there is nothing worse than seeing the Double Fine logo appear before the start of this game. Not only did they have nothing to do with what made Grim Fandango great, but they ruined this port as much as they could. I've crashed this game twice. TWICE. I didn't even know it was possible to glitch and break GF, but Double Fine sure made it possible.\n\nOn top of making it possible to break the game, some of the character models will jump erratically in place. Whether it's the cause of broken/corrupt animation files or poor programming, I don't know, but this is inexcusable for a "remaster".\n\nOn that subject, the quality is still what it's always been. It looks exactly like how I remember it (outside of the missing frames or animation from the original)... because they didn't change anything, but not that they needed to. This is still a gorgeously designed game, but even I noticed the artifacts and weird compression that was necessary for the time it was made on the backgrounds or the cinematics. Is there anything they could have done? Well maybe they could have remastered a game that they still had the master files to. It was no doubt a better choice to just leave it rather than tamper with it and make it ugly like Resident Evil Remake HD.\n\nThey did however tarnish how seamless the original felt by throwing up stupid HUD icons made specifically for console gamers or just modern gamers, cause I think even consoles gamers aren't dumb enough not to realise that they can press up or down to do something in game. No Doublefine, we don't need those out of place icons. PRESS THE ESCAPE KEY TO SKIP THE CUTSCENE! Gee thanks.\n\nOne of my favorite things to do in the original was to save at specific points just so I could mess around or explore them. Some of my favorite moments included the poetry slam at the Blue Casket or the real world with the real humans. I'd give the files their own names and everything, and I could make as many as I wanted. CAN'T DO THAT NOW! They made Grim Fandango into some bad survival horror game, as I'm locked to only 8 slots for some stupid reason.\n\nI do remember when they hyped how the new game would have remastered music. Didn't sound any different really than I remembered it. It's still one of the best soundtracks ever produced to any game, period. If there was anything that needed to be touched up, it wasn't this.\n\nThere's also something straight up broken about the new tank controls. I'd get myself caught in door loops over and over (which is to get you to go in and out of the same area over and over if you're not careful) in a way that I didn't in the original. There were also new point and click controls that were added but I didn't try them because you'd have to be an idiot to play this game like that.\n\nDoes this remastered version do anything right that's new? Well... the commentary I guess, but even then I'm scared to hear that Tim will say that every character is a pangender neutral skeleton soul, or that Grim Fandango is problematic/misogynist cause females are sometimes the bad guys or that he was appropriating Mexican culture when he made this as he's a disgusting evil white male. Yuck. Go away Double Fine.\n\nI'm not saying you should bust out your old CDs or to order yourself a copy off eBay. At the end of the day, this is still Grim Fandango, and even broken Grim Fandango is worth experiencing. It homages the classics like Casablanca or His Girl Friday but without having to rip them off. GF also sports one of the most creative universes I've ever seen in a video game. Yes, it's based on the Day of the Dead, but it's so realised like nothing before or since. The puns, the jokes, the characters, the setting. Everything clicks and works. I've never forgotten a thing and know it like the back of my hand... but I had to play it again. Even despite my disdain for Double Fine. It's just one of those kind of games.\n\nTim Schafer might have killed adventure games with his ridiculous budget that he obtained from Lucasarts for this game, but to be honest, this was something to go out on a bang on. I'd be fine with him bankrupting any company as long as he made games like this. If this remaster was more about convenience and getting it to new players, fine, but to a purist like myself, this is still nowhere even close to the best way to play this classic. Recommended but with an asterisk. Buyer beware of what you're getting into.\n\nThe Pro's:\n+It's Grim Fandango\nThe Con's:\n-It's buggy Grim Fandango","January 10","true","8.0"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"

SO memorable that I knew what to do most of the time after all this years.\n\nThe story is good, but some of the characters can be annoying sometimes (either because it was on purpose or not).

Be sure to see Manny's head because it will indicate that there's something to interact and listen every single word that everyone has to say.\n\nThe remastered edition is just that. No true Widescreen/HD, just the same good old game for current PCs with better texture models. The game has 3 types of controls: The P&C, Free Movement and the Tank Control (move like a tank).\n\nI recommend using the Tank Control because you will have a better movement each time the camera changes, and because it's SERIOUSLY MEANT to be played like that.","November 29, 2015","true","7.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The 'Land of the Dead' feels unique and interesting no matter where you are.\n\n+ This game features one of the best cast of characters assembled in any game. Every character has their own unique personalities which is a testament to the brilliant writing. It is one of the best written games on the market and the fact that this still holds true almost 20 years later shows just how well this game has aged.\n\n+ The overall story and plot is fantastic, and if you play it a few times you will pick up on things you didn't notice before.\n\n+ The puzzles are integrated nicely into the gameplay and story, although some puzzles are pretty difficult to solve without the help of a walkthrough.\n\n+ Fantastic voice acting\n\n+ Amazing soundtrack and music\n\n+ No HUD makes for a more immersive experience\n\n+ Can switch seamlessly between remastered and original version\n\n+ Developer commentary giving you insight in the development process\n\n+ Controller and mouse support\n\n+ Easy achievements\n\n\nThe Average:\n\nCalling it a 'remaster' feels like a stretch as the only thing redone was the character models and lighting. However, the game being released in modern times so that more people can play this classic is always a good thing.\n\nOddly, the game lacks certain graphical options i.e vsync...\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The game has a few bugs and glitches. I experienced one odd graphical glitch that happened in the beginning of the game and was persistent throughout the entire game. I also noticed graphical glitches that were present in the original game showing up in this version.\n\n- 'Hotspots' are indicated by the main character moving his head and looking at a particular object. If object are too close together it can be very easy to miss something.\n\n- The inventory system is a real pain and makes solving puzzles a lot harder than needed. Arguably the worst aspect of the game.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis game came out just as point and click adventure games were dying off and didn't get the mass recognition it deserves. I couldn't be happier that this game got a re-release so that it can be enjoyed by more people. This is one of the few games where I would say even if you're not a fan of point and click adventure games you should still play this game because the characters, dialogue and story are top tier in the industry.\n","September 10, 2015","true","6.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

But all the clients he gets are a bunch of “deadbeats” that aren't going to further his goals of working off his community service or sell enough premium travel packets so that he can leave this “Land of the dead”; a state of limbo in the form of a menial, tiresome, job for the average working dead man. This agent, Manny, is working as a Grim Reaper offering travel arrangements for the newly deceased. With this introduction we realize that death has as many hardships as life, and we're soon to realize the extent of it.\n\nGrim Fandango immediately strikes us with a depressing undertone: a laborious economical hierarchy is the erzats of the idea of paradise, and the jouissance of everlasting life in a heavenly realm is as laughable as it should be when it is ironically juxtaposed to what Grim Fandango conveys. Contrasting the drabness and tiredness of this limbo and the subject of death itself, with the incredibly jovial tone of the game and the obvious Mexican influences (Día de Muertos, where the dead and death is celebrated and the attitude towards death is rather lighthearted in general), creates a constant tug of war between disjunctive emotive states that somehow perfectly match each other.\n\nWhat you notice not before long is how stingy the game is with hints. You have so very little go on in each turn of the game and it's not rare that you sometimes stumble upon the solution before you even know what you are supposed to accomplish. The problem is not clearly conveyed and therefore it's difficult to really follow what the game wants you to do. Fortunate enough, the game world and the conversations are entertaining enough to warrant some dillydallying, even though it is on the edge of returning to the sphere of annoyance and frustration it just manages to keep you going.\n\nMoreover, the puzzle design and solutions are a bit nonsensical. Not in the way that they are impossible to figure out or take you a whole lot of time to figure out once the problem is laid out, but in the absurdity of it all. The puzzles have a certain path or linearity to them that makes it somewhat simple, you just try everything available and everything comes naturally, but when you step back and retroactively think about the puzzle, you realize the absurdity of its solution and can't help but laugh. Items are placed with the ilk of haphazardness, and the aleatory coming forth of characters often attribute to this overall lostness and entanglement a player may feel or find themselves in. The nonsense and madness has a structure and form that is not unimaginably difficult to see through, the objectives are veiled or very subtle, but the required actions are transparently easy to imagine in many places, especially for a player keen on exploring. Mindlessness is oddly enough probably a better prerequisite than thoughtfulness in this particular game. Your ideas have to digress, regress and follow the illogical nature of “just doing”. This creates an interesting challenge for veteran puzzle players, and a helpfulness for those that are not familiar with the game genre: the knowledgeable have to reevaluate their problem solving, and the unfamiliar can flail about and still hit the button of progression. I shouldn't undermine the puzzle-design too much, though. It is still wonderfully thought-provoking and funny, and there's really more logic and sense to a lot of it than you may think. Mainly, you just have to surrender yourself to the game's logic, or non-logic, which is something I was more than willing to do, despite the silliness.\n\nDespite an interesting story, premise and generally wonderful art-design and style choices, the game can look quite awful which slightly lessens the over all impression. Most animations still look dated, textures vary in quality and the same goes for lighting. Personally, the parts that look bad are negligible, and the negation of that made it an emaciated attempt at ruining my experience, but I know others may differ in how they approach graphical quality, so it should be stated that the game doesn't look fantastic at all points, but it is easily negatable.\nThe mixing was also one of these things that brought the game down a bit in some places. And this was to me not as easy to ignore, since I can always look away from the ugliness, but the auricular noise is unavoidable and with bad mixing, it can interfere with dialog, which hinders progress and thus becomes an annoyance. A lot of the sounds just doesn't sound nice either, like the design of effect-sounds can be really jarring and difficult to listen to, especially when they repeat. Like the driving section – which, by the way, may have been the worst driving section of any game I've ever played – where to music was very loudly intermixed with the motors rumbling and created this painful cacophony that along with the cars awful handing made this part very difficult to enjoy, despite it being in the company of our very lovable personal driver.\n\nI hate to keep going with the negatives with a game like this. But the game doesn't have an autosave function. That's perfectly alright, it forces you to keep track on your progression and where you are, it also gives you the power to stop whenever you want to without having to retread old steps, but when the game can lock itself into a state where you are forced to restart, you really need something like an autosave or a checkpoint system. There is no way to predict if a game is buggy or not, so if you don't save because you know you're going to play for a while, and then the game bugs out on you, you're stuck either leaving the game for another day, due to frustration, or going through the same thing you just did all over again. This is really not acceptable in any game, honestly. Sure, the game is wonderful, but redoing everything retracts from that impression, unfortunately, and replaces any joy with frustration. There's something sad about losing immense enjoyment from something so basic like not having the game hardlock. I am not sure if this is happening to anyone else, but it happened during my playthrough.\n\nIn reality, we all probably know what Grim Fandango is, and it's great to see it come back for a later generation and for those that never got around to playing this classic game. The small issues that are game-related, like hardlocking and retreading is forgivable due to the substance of the game and are easily worked around by saving often, it's just sad to see something like that wear down on an otherwise incredible game. Grim Fandango is in fact truly unique, as you might imagine, and its setting is interesting in a way that not many games are. The humor is that of any classic Tim Schafer game that in accordance with some of the greastest character designs is worth it solely based on that, but you get a whole lot more, as long as you don't expect a remastered version to be entirely perfect, because it isn't, you will find a lot of enjoyment in this game, for both for the thoughtful and the mindless side of yourself.","January 27, 2015","true","10.6"," 30 of 52 people (58%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","58","30","52","11","0"

The way that the player interacts with the game world is just so obtuse and archaic, I found myself wandering endlessly just trying to figure out the next thing to click on. Solutions to "puzzles" (I hazard to call them that) include equipping each item and interacting with every available option just to see what sticks. When I finally figured out what to do, I wasn't thinking "boy that was clever." Nearly every one had me saying "wow that was stupid."\n\nI usually don't give much thought to graphical achievement if the gameplay is solid, but honestly the visuals in the remastered version of this game are still just plain bad. Sure the character models are updated, but the environments are muddy and messy, making it unclear what can be interacted with and what cannot. Given the technical achievements of games like Kingdom Hearts: Re:Chain of Memories and Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes, I found this effort to reek of laziness.\n\nThe game deserves some credit for weaving a decent story, but it's nothing to write home about. I found Manny to be such a weasel I honestly didn't think he deserved to  board the Double N train.  Manny takes advantage of other characters, lies and steals to finally get to Meche despite only having met her for a couple minutes. Manny's actions make it clear that he is selfish and conniving, and that his pursuit of Meche is just an excuse to leave his life behind and the people who helped get him there. Much of the relationships that Manny has with other characters is implied more than shown, which leads to many confusing moments where characters die and we were supposed to care (e.g.  Lola in Year 2 ). Overall the story is so disjointed and unearned, I wondered if I had should have spent my time reading a good book rather than slogging through the last two sections of Grim Fandango.\n\nThis game makes some decent leaps and strides in terms of where games were in 1998. Today it is a relic of poor game design and hacky storytelling that is better off left forgotten.","December 8, 2015","false","16.1"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","23","39","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theironictea/recommended/316790/","theironictea","TheIronicTea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theironictea/","155 products in account","In this mini-review I'll be mostly discussing the positive and negative sides of the REMASTERED version.\n\nGrim Fandango: Remastered edition is mostly fantastic. Especially Peter McConnell's re-recorded musical score is reason enough to purchase the game, since it is without a doubt one of the best original soundtracks ever featured in a video game. For the first time all of the music has been recorded with a live-orchestra, and it shows.\n\nThe improved models are a nice touch, and there's a remarkable change in the look of the game. However, the pre-rendered painted backgrounds have not been changed, but they still hold up today surprisingly well, though the game is locked in 4:3 aspect ratio. There's a 16:9 streched option available, but it doesn't look good. You can change the look of the game to the original with the simple press of the backspace button, which is an excellent feature.\n\nDeveloper Commentary is also included within the game, toggleable in the "special features" submenu. In game, a film roll is present in the top-left corner of the game when a developer commentary is available. It is a very handy feature, and doesn't pull you out of the game, since you can decide so easily when to listen to them or not. Unfortunately the audio cuts off quite easily when interracting with the environment, so patience is usually required when listening to these, but they're only a few minutes long. The commentary consists of former Lucas Arts employees discussing about the game, and it's great fun listening to all of the details. Tim Schafer and Peter McConnell feature in it.\n\nOne of the things that was one of the most commercialized aspects in this re-release was the improved lighting. Unfortunately it doesn't work very well, and the original shadows surpass the new shadows occasionally. For example, when walking towards a lighthouse no shadow is casted behind the models in the remastered mode, but in the original there is. The new models are also always very lit even in dark areas, in which the original version again looks much better. Most of the time this is not a problem however, and the game does look remarkably better with the improved textures.\n\nThe most annoying problem in the remastered version is the occasional bug. I had to restart my game during my playthrough about 10 times, because the game softlocked after I tried to get an item out of my inventory. Double Fine is apparently working on a patch to fix this presumably, and it's not a game breaking deal if you just remember to save often.\n\nThe price is cheap. I would recommend buying this after Double Fine fixes the annoying softlocks. It's still quite playable though, and the game still holds up today very nicely, but the puzzles are very dated in my opinion. Grim Fandango is still a classic game, and one of the best adventure games of all time.","February 13, 2015","true","12.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chriskringel/recommended/316790/","chriskringel","chriskringel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chriskringel/","1785 products in account","I thought I already gave this release a negative review, and I wanted to change it to a positive review. But I mixed that up with Broken Age (*cough* "classic point-and-click adventure" *cough*), which is one reason I got super annoyed with Double Fine (and the latter deserves a negative review if you ask me). But what about Grim Fandango Remastered? It's complicated:\n\nFirst: This game is really GOOD. Just replaying the last scene of Year One and the transition cutscene to Year Two, plus the soundtrack, I mean, c'mon it is just plain epic. It's tough to ignore all of the genius of the original game, it's mood, it's story and so on. I'm super glad that Schafer really did NOT went "George's Special Edition" all over the place (which would have been the worst thing one could possibly ever do.) So far so good. But was "Remastered" just a cash grab? For me it's 50/50. Yes, they've re-done all the textures for the models, that is ok'ish. But in the Making Of videos that let it look like they would had HD source material of the backgrounds in their hands (something like "oh we called everyone, we got this huge archive from Lucas... bla bla bla"). In the Making-Ofs expectations are likely to get a little bit exagerrated. Secondly the renderer. Yes you can switch back to the "old look". But it's not the whole true. When you switch to classic mode, they show the old renderer *without* HW acceleration. But the original '98 release did have DirectX HW acceleration and with that turned on (plus forcing Antialiasing from e.g. your Nvidia driver settings) it looks nearly the same way. Though the new models' texture indeed look a bit more crisp, like clean svg images without any compression artifacts. Again, remember, it's just about the texture on the models, nothing less, but also nothing more. I come to think they let the "classic" renderer look super bad, because so it looks like they really "remastered" Grim Fandango. But it is more of a little polished re-release, if you ask me. Playing the old 2 CD-ROMs with ResidualVM, setting the scaling correctly and my monitor to 800x600, and forcing anti-aliasing from my driver's setting plus enabled HW acceleration in the game's settings (yes it's possible with ResidualVM) it looks nearly as good as this new released version. I tested it both on Linux and Windows with an Nvidia card. Last but not least the menus of the remastered version, well, they look a bit rushed to me. The background is cool but the menus look a bit cheap to me. Altogether I think this "Remastered" version was a bit rushed out to the door. And for some people it tends to be a bit buggy. However, *if* you encounter any serious bugs, head for a refund. This specific point shouldn't stop you from buying and giving it a try. Last but not least, they changed the interface a little bit, with an icon permanently in the lower right of your screen. Well, if wish it could be disabled in preferences, because I don't like it that much and it wasn't in the original game. Again, Settings and Menu fall really flat. Also: There is NO real widescreen support. If you set 16:9 the game will get stretched, yuck. Why do they have included this option at all? It's pointless and pretty ugly. If you play in 4:3 you will have borders on the right and the left, decorated mexican/aztec'ish borders  or black bars. At least they let you set that in the preferences. One point is even a step back from the original: The lighting looks technically better, however it is not that carefully set as in the original. Sometimes it's not that perfect mood, sometimes it's different, sometimes it is done more simple and cuts out some tiny pieces from the athmosphere of a few scenes and settings. And otherwise sometimes the new lighting is really quite a bit over the top. I mean come on, my head really doesn't glow orange when I smoke a cigarette. Even when it's night.\n\nAnd now the good stuff: The game was and is just great. The soundtrack really got remastered although it is not always that different, but at least you can buy it and compare it (at first I thought they just re-recorded a very few themes, cash-grab and so on, --- but it seems like they really let Peter McConnell re-record a lot more.) I was just very suspicious because starting after 'The Cave' all Double Fine releases seemed really rushed and flat to me (DF-9, Broken Promises, eh, Age, I mean -- and all other titles at least rushed). But the soundtrack, hey, it's true, it's really re-recorded at least on the bigger amount of it.\n\nDid this release got some love at all? Yes! The internationalization, they at least included more speaking languages than English and they included the German translation (which I bought '98 on two CD-ROMs) with the voiceactor of German ALF as the voice of Manny (it worked really well, even if you would not believe it! I loved it). Grim Fandango had some localized versions with top-notch voiceacting and yeah they included it all. Which is definitely a bonus over the version I own. So now I can enjoy the game in both versions, localized (like 98 of 100) and original (100 of 100).\n\nWhat else? Well, thanks to cash-grabby-plushy Double Fine Productions I can play the game absolutely hassle-free, I don't have to search my CD-ROMs, I don't need to set up ResidualVM, and don't have to fiddle with graphics settings and my monitor (that was a CRT last time I played it...), I just download the game and get at least a really solid "good enough" result. I can't deny that. Even more: That platform which only had Doom 3 demo and Planet Tuxracer as games a few years ago (ok, and Frozen Bubble 2 maybe), I can just enjoy Grim Fandango on Linux. Whoah! (Ok, ResidualVM also supports Linux pretty well and with at least with Nvidia -and/or others- you get HW accel also, ... but you get my point. Hassle-free(tm) was not included with that. And now it is.) Of course the system specifications, why that huge amount of RAM? Looks like a little bit more time for programming would have been good, but ok. On Linux OpenGL 3.3 is more than reasonable, if you're stuck with 2.1 it's time for a new graphics card generally.\n\nConclusion: I get the game for Windows, Mac and Linux/SteamOS. I get in-game re-recorded remastered lovely soundtrack. I can play the original version or one of the extremely well-done localized versions. The graphics are a bit better also. Plus the awesomeness of the original. Equals: Thumbs up! That maybe was close - but it really is "Yes!" for me in the end. I enjoy this game too much.\n\n(EDIT: typos)","September 7, 2015","true","0.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","3"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","This was the first time I had ever played this game, so I think I am free of any biases when I say this is one of my favorite games of all time. If not the top one, then within the top five.\n\nMy previous experience with point-and-click games have been mixed. Early TellTale games were hit-and-miss with me; I loved Back to the Future but I couldn't finish a Sam & Max game, and yet both games suffered from a problem inherent with the genre: Absurd puzzle logic. Another major gripe is when you had to click all over the screen for any pixels of an essential item.\n\nThere are one or two moments like the latter where I couldn't see the object I needed (the can-opener being one). But, to my surprise, Grim Fandago handles the puzzles in a very logical, challenging manner.\n\nNo item is used too unconventionally. You would think that would make the game too easy or boring, but the game strikes a right balance for logic and challenge.\n\n(The only exception is the scythe, which is fine  because it's sometimes the only item you have and you use it is still logically.)\n\nThe story and characters are also memorable, especially Manny Callivero. I don't feel like spoiling the story because it's best to not have expectations.\n\nIf you want my thoughts on the story itself, read below.\n\nAn Interpretation\nAs this section is a comprehensive overview, spoilers will be mentioned to piece together my thoughts on the game. I don't expect this interpretation to be a selling point as to why the game is superb. I am sharing these thoughts because I think this is one of the best forms of art I've seen in a videogame. The game will make you think.\n\nWhen I say this game is more for adults than kids, I don't mean the game is chalk full of swear words, sexual vibes and other petty things (which there is a lot of, and I like it). I think this game is tailored to adults because the themes of the game are depressing, especially if you're an adult who is weary of the postmodern world. And that word, postmodern, is important.\n\nThe game is when the postmodern meets the postmortem. The game plays with that idea in its story and its humor.\n\nThe postmodern is, basically, the realization that a lot of modern ideas (culture, architecture and, sometimes, even religion) are full of absurdities. And the purpose of postmodernism is to rethink why we accept the things as they are.\n\nSometimes that means critizing common ideas held as obvious truths; sometimes it means realizing the futility of your choices in life, of the prepackaged "choices" you have (ex, Coke or Pepsi?); and sometimes it's as simple as poking fun at the genre or the tropes themselves.\n\nThis game handles a lot of these ideas in a very subtle way that I think only older folks would appreciate, or a curious teenager wondering why a lot of things in life seem stupid or rigged.\n\nFor starters, Manny Callivera is an "honest" (if the term can be used) salesman trying to get his clients to the end of the Land of the Dead in order to repay his debts. For years Manny has been on the high of his job, only for his skills to be suddenly lost with bad clients, which has let Domino gain his new fame.\n\nIt is only after Manny cheats the system to get a new high-stakes client that Manny realizes the system itself is rigged. This realization leads to the beginnings of a revolution to build-up throughout the game, although Manny only cares about righting what he did wrong to someone else.\n\nThroughout Manny's journey for Meche, he goes from one-career to another through his sheer determination, but he always starts out as a floor-mopper or out with nothing walking the land.\n\nIn a year's time, he becomes the head of his own little casino and in another he becomes a ship-captain, and in another year he defeats the crime-boss orchestrating the Land of the Dead.\n\nThere's always something that ruins whatever progress he makes--after all, a game with no obstacles would be boring--yet it never keeps Manny from trying. His humor as well as his determination are what keep him going.\n\nBut this idea not just limited to Manny. When you consider the side-characters and the villians there's a lot of postmodern subtext to be found too.\n\nThe Number 9 Tickets are stolen from the "good" people and sold to people who have the cash. The good people who were supposed to get their tickets are put to slave-labor. There are also other good people who try to resist the rigged system who get sprouted (Lola) or conned (anything gambling related).\n\nBut, as we know, the people with the cash don't get into the heaven/next world because the gatekeeper sends the train to Hell. You can't fool the higher system.\n\nHowever, what this plot-point also establishes, the system can be misused and it seems like whoever is in charge is fine so long as the bad get punished when trying to break the system. As the gatekeeper states, "Your destiny cannot be purchased... The gate opens... The gate closes... It does not help."\n\nThis line says a lot, "Your destiny cannot be purchased." The obvious question that comes to mind for the Land of the Dead--not only to Manny--is what is the value of money?\n\nContrary to the Gatekeeper, the Land of the Dead is orchestrated by money. This was not its intended purpose. The Land of the Dead is a purgatory place where the dead go to their ultimate fate; some reach the end sooner than others and others never go there because they've given up. And when there's nowhere to go, living a life similar to the one in the living world is the only alternative the people have left to live for.\n\nThis, I think, is why I think Hector is a greater villian than he's given credit for. The game seems to leave a plot-hole for his motives but his motives are quite clear: He isn't interested in cheating the system to get to the end--he knows he cannot change his ultimate fate. Where as most would just give up he intends to make some purpose for himself; he manipulates the system that he can control and profit from his schemes. A profit with no inherent value other than itself.\n\nIt doesn't matter that Hector isn't better than the "Creator." Hector knows his place and his limitations, and he plays El Marrow like a fiddle. It is this arrogance that ultimately gets the better of him when he tries to make Manny suffer, giving him time to turn the tables on Hector.\n\nNow some may argue that the "Creator" is intervening through Manny Calivero. After all, Manny IS the Angel of Death and you can think of the line, "The reason for the revolution is because of her [Meche]", to be the creator setting their fates together so they can overthrown the system.\n\nI can't deny that this interpretation isn't valid because the game doesn't outright deal with the Creator. Probably for the best.\n\nI choose to think that Manny decides his fate himself. Maybe on an act of love, maybe on an act of redemption, but ultimately its his own choices that matter. In a postmortem world, that is all that really matters.\n\nBut the main reason why I choose this second interpretation is because of the gameplay: Puzzles.\n\nYou solve absurd dilemmas with (mostly) logical means. Now, of course, a point-and-click has only puzzles to work with--that's the game, duh! But I think this is one case where the puzzles themselves shape the story.\n\nYou never solve a problem directly; you are always finding some dirt (the photo), some help (Glottis) or some alternative way to solve a problem (Hector). Even though the game has a lot of absurd outcomes, the puzzles themselves are always logical.\n\nSo not only is Manny's determination (whatever it may be) the key to saving the day but also his critical thinking skills the means to restoring order in a corrupt land. It is his choices, it is his actions, it is his reasons that bring happiness across a land once simply tired, illogical and dead.","September 14, 2015","true","10.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

While the remaster does its job by implementing more modern control schemes such as the controller and the Keyboard+Mouse, higher quality textures, there really is nothing else thats new.\n\nTextures are updated including much better lighting. Unfortunately, it is only during the gameplay segments that you would see these upgrades whereas the cutscenes are left as it was, which is a noticable downgrade of graphics when moving in and out of cutscenes. Animations are also hardly updated as far as I can tell and would sometimes bug out. Moving from one place to another also takes way too long at times and definitely is an obvious problem when transitioning a game that is 15 years old, why are these issues not addressed? These things make the game feel extremely dated regardless of having the word 'Remastered' plastered all over the game.\n\nNow onto the less techincal aspect of the game. Grim Fandango was known to be a pretty hard point-and-click adventure game because of its lack of hints or hand-holding. Ok, scratch that, there are literally no hints at all most of the time. This might frustrate some players as the puzzles do take a damn lot of time. It would fare better to have more hints to make the game much more accessible or perhaps an option for hints for those who got the game for its story.\n\nBefore reading this review, chances are you would know that Grim Fandango's strengths are in its story, characters and the world. Grim Fandango's story is most definitely one of the most unique and creative I (personally) have seen and its cast of charming characters, boasted by great voice actors, needless to say, makes it all the more a unique experience.\n\nWhile so, I find it that the character development is quite lacking and that the story was pretty short. I was hoping that I could learn more about how the afterlife world is like and perhaps, our favourite travel agent's history and what sin got him into the job.\n\nIn retrospect, if you don't mind clunky gameplay but absolutely love point-and-click games, this game is a definite no brainer. I would not recommend this game for those who are looking for a more fast paced or even moderately paced game as this game definitely takes up a whole lot of time. But for anyone who's into a great story with an enchantingly unforgettable cast of characters, then my friend, do yourself a favour.\n\n8.5/10 as its base game\n\n6/10 for its bare-boned remaster which makes it look like a lazy cash grab.","April 10, 2015","true","6.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

This is not an exaggeration, it won several Game of the Year awards which wasn't easy in 1998 with such tough competition as Half-Life.\n\nUnfortunately, despite praise from the critics and scoring extremely well, it sold poorly and was a commerical failure. Many people think this was the nail in the coffin of the adventure game genre as it soon died out as publishers thought to themselves if a game as brilliant as Grim Fandango can't sell, what's the point?\n\nToday, ladies and gentlemen, seventeen years on, this wrong can finally be righted. And who knows, if it sells well, Grim Fandango 2 might just happen!\n\nAnyway, that was just a bit of background information about the game in case you missed it or were too young the first time. It's an adventure game in the classic LucasArts style and the usual chatting and solving puzzles etc.\n\nYou are dead, but who knew the land of the dead looked this good? I don't want to give away too much information about the game as it's much better discovering it yourself, but it is fairly lengthy and you go through a whole load of good looking and varied locations. It has a wonderful art style, and the soundtrack is regarded as one of gaming's greatest.\n\nIf you're wondering what the remastered offers over the original:\n\nHi-res character textures\nNew lighting system\nNew controls\nWorks on modern computers (the old Grim was a pain to set up on modern hardware)\n\nIf you like adventure games but haven't tried this game yet for whatever reason, buying this is a no brainer.

Because it's such a classic and I'm glad I finally crossed it off my list, I pressed the "thumbs up" for this review, but I gotta say I did this with more than a little ambivalence.\n\nEven if you like point-and-click adventures... if you are annoyed by convoluted puzzles that seemingly can't be solved without using a walkthrough, then, well, I'm not saying stay away from this game, but at least be warned; know what you're getting into. That being said I know people still might want to play the game, like me, because it's such a classic.\n\nLong version:\nI was super excited to play this game, since it's such a classic and I somehow kinda missed it back in the day. I played a lot of Monkey Island and even the classic Indiana Jones adventures. But somehow, I never got around to playing Grim Fandango. So I was kinda curious to finally see what all the fuss is about.\nI certainly liked some aspects a lot, like the setting and the story (albeit a little far fetched at times), the voice acting and the soundtrack.\n\nThe gameplay however, and especially some of the puzzles, really don't hold up if you ask me. Like I said, I played my fair share of point and click adventures, and especially if you compare GF to the Monkey Island franchise, the brand of humor and the basic logic behind discovering solutions is pretty much the same. But I found myself often uttering a loud "REALLY....?"when I finally found some of the solutions in Grim Fandango. Some of them were so obscure or convoluted that it spoiled my enjoyment of the game.\n\nMaybe it's me who has become lazy in the Google era, but I wonder how anyone ever finished this game back in the day without a walkthrough. That is, unless you are trying to brute-force your way through by combining every item in your inventory with every element of the world. Maybe it's the curse of knowing that you have Google at your disposal that makes you give up sooner. But it being the year 2015 as I write this, and it being a given that Google is in fact, at my constant disposal, I found myself using it on several occasions. The logic of several puzzles only worked for me AFTER I knew the solutions, and even then only slightly. Never did I feel stupid for having to Google the answer; never did I feel like in hindsight I should have had a little more persistence and then I would have found the answer. No, after I found the solutions, I often felt only angrier that the game expected me to work out this often far fetched logic on my own.\n\nThen, on a sidenote, there were also some minor issues with the mechanics of some of the puzzles. In those cases, even if you understood (or suspected) the logic that was needed, it was incredibly tedious to the point of clumsiness to execute the solution.\n\nIn the end, I was about 33% happy that I finally got around to playing (and finishing) this classic game, about 33% relieved that I finally fought my way through it to move on to another game to play, and 33% disappointed that I damaged my image of the game this way by playing it. Like I said, it may be me, or it may be the game, but either way I think it might have worked a lot better if I played it 15 years ago.","November 29, 2015","true","37.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","5"

They redid all the character models in the game & made it high resolution. Unfortunately, the 3D background was not remade (not surprising as it would consume a hefty amount of money/time/effort) & can be slightly blurry & a mismatch when compared to the high-resolution character models. In the original game played on an old system, both of these blend extremely well & could hardly be told apart\nlack of "REAL" wide screen 16:9 support. The game offers wide screen, but it either stretch the image to fit the screen, or have two black/gold bars on the left/right while retaining original image size. I used the two black bars & after playing 5 minutes with it, I dont even realize it's there. It's not a big deal\nsome of the game elements can feel dated\nWHINNY REVIEW:	What can I say, this game broke my heart a few times. Let me put it straight: this game is one of the best adventure games I have ever played in my life. period. I first played the game when I was a kid back in 1998 & immediately fell in love with it. It is ingeniously brilliant, excellent story line, amazing graphics, music, sounds & production value. To justify my claims, it won several Game of the Year awards / Best Adventure GOTY, against other great games like HalfLife, Starcraft, Baldur's Gate, Tomb Raider 3, etc. I immediately set my life goal to find a new original boxed GF which I can keep as a collection/legacy. That was when my heart was 1st broken. There is no where to be found in M'sia. I continued this mission for a couple of years in several different continents, but to no avail. The 2nd time my heart was broken is the fact that, despite the game's universally acclaimed reviews, the sales of this game was considered poor. Shortly after, the creator of GF (Tim Schafer) & several others left Lucasarts (which at that time was producing most of the major adventure game titles). That's the 3rd stab in the heart. 4th came not long after GF's "failure", production of adventure games started to decline drastically & many considered this to be the death of adventure games. Lucasarts canceled several adventure game titles in development. 17 years later, GF caught everyone by surprise when the remastered version was announced! I was very thrilled by the announcement but with my heart broken yet again when it was said to be a PS exclusive. It wasn't long before the PC platform was quietly announced, much to my relief!\n\nThe game itself is stunning back in 1998 & even now remastered, it still managed to deliver & preserve most of the qualities that made this game so amazing in the 1st place. As a comparison, if anyone is to replay a classic 1998 game now (2015), most of the games will not offer the same gratification / remarkable experience that you had back then. You'll most probably end up disappointed & in utter disbelief that that was the game you played in the past (you'll probably swear that the game looked & felt much better when you played it more than 15 years ago). This is not the case for GF, although certain sections of the games do begin to show its age\n\nIn summary, YES, I'd highly recommend you to buy this game. It is a very well worth adventure, the puzzles are ingenious & sensible (walkthrough is recommended for casual gamers), excellent music, plot top notch, dialogues/voice acting humorous & very well scripted. Graphics are nothing to shout about, but tolerable. To be honest, there are still not many quality adventure games out there & if you are looking for a good, high quality adventure game, this one is not to be missed. If you missed the boat in 1998, be sure not to miss again now","December 29, 2015","true","8.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I played this game when I was younger and still kept the original discs when I moved half way around the world. So it's safe to say I'm a fan of this game. But speaking from someone who's played this game many times before I still enjoy it. The story was always fresh to me and the remastered version has marginal changes to the original. The most prevalent being  improved lighting and the controls scheme has been overhauled but you can still use tank settings if you want the experience or the achievement.\n\nWhat this game offers is a light hearted story bursting at the seems with personality set in the land of the dead. Are you plagued by all those tough moral decisions that seem quite popular in adventures these days ? No worries because the characters here are already dead. Fear not, even though most of the cast are a bunch of skeletons they're bursting with personality and  still as lively as ever.\n\nThe imaginative setting of El Marrow and the surrounding locales is quite vibrant despite the overall gritty noir feel to the game. And with each changing year we see Manny and Glottis change a bit. And although this story is about Manny trying to find a girl there's a whole bunch of gangster stuff going down that it never really feels like the romance between Manny and Meche is given time to blossom but they've still got chemistry when they meet up. So none of that mushy flaky romance thing to get in the way of everything else.\n\nBe forewarned though, Grim Fandango isn't an easy game. It was never an easy game. It features some extremely complex and sometimes obscure puzzles that at one point or another you might consult a walkthrough. Also there is absolutely no hint system to speak of. Remember this game was created during  a time when companies had hotlines for hints in games. And Brady made highly elaborate strategy guides that sold for as much as this game costs now. Thank god for the internet but yeah this isn't an easy game so if you're someone who gives up easy and you don't like adventure games I highly suggest you try something else.\n\nThe remastered graphics still feel dated but the game is timeless and has updated versatile controls. Also boasts a developer commentary and a concept art gallery. It's definitely a good buy on sale if you want to play something cool or if you're a fan of the original.","July 17, 2015","true","11.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, though, I was eagerly anticipating this release, too :3 I've played other point-and-click adventure games before, like Sam & Max, the Monkey Island series, and Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People, so I was looking forward to more games in the same genre, and generally knew what to expect in terms of basic gameplay.\n\nThis game delivered; I REALLY enjoyed it.  The story took some unpredictable turns, the "ah-ha!" moments when I figured out a puzzle were great (as they usually are in games like these), and the writing was really good.  Also, there were memorable characters (Glottis stands out the most for me for some reason; and though a minor character, I loved that there was someone Hungarian, me being half-Hungarian myself :3), and there are six different language options (in the US version) with FULL AUDIO.  That was an awesome addition.\n\nMy only complaint is that the game, as it stands now relatively soon after release, is full of glitches and bugs.  The glitches range from funny (a character magically "levitating" an object in midair when they move their hand :3) to downright annoying (the game freezing up and not letting you do anything).  To avoid these pitfalls, it's important that you SAVE OFTEN because the game doesn't autosave, and if you meet an unexpected glitch, you might have to replay a significant portion of the chapter/game.  Also, as others have pointed out, the game seems to require an unexpectedly high set of minimum specs to run the game.  Still, the problems weren't enough to deter me from playing all the way through, because I was hooked and wanted to find out what happened.\n\nIn short, if you haven't played this game, please try it out!

People who've played it before will already know whether they like it or not. The main difference for those who've visited the Land of the Dead before will be the remastered graphics and they have been made to look a lot nicer with the character models having the most improvement.\n\nFor those who haven't played this before it definitely is worth a go. It's a classic point and click puzzle game that still holds up really well.\n\nIn it you play Manny Calavera, a travel agent in the Land of the Dead,who supplies the recently dead with travel options to  get to the Ninth Underworld with good souls being rewarded with a train ticket direct and the not so good souls getting a crappier option.\n\nThe game's setting has a Noir style married with Mexican Day of the Dead theme and the game pulls off this odd combination of brilliantly. The Land of the Dead is populated with brilliant characters which really makes the game great. My favourite being Glottis, Manny's friend/sidekick. The games story is also brilliant and really outshines some of the best games we've had recently in this department.\n\nThe gameplay itself is old style point and click (though you can use a controller) type gameplay with loads of puzzles. The game doesn't hand hold you either and it's puzzles will really challenge you but its more rewarding when you figure it out.\n\nThe Good:\n- Classic game with memorable characters and a great story\n- Brilliant setting that even now feels really original and gives the game a unique character.\n- Challenging puzzles that will please those who think modern games are too easy\n-Graphics upgrade is a nice edition and looks great\n\nThe Bad:\n-Occasional bugs which made me have to reload my game a couple of times\n\nTo sum it all up this game is a classic and stole holds it own nearly 20 years after it's original release. 9.5/10","February 7, 2015","true","13.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Definitely thumbs up for the glorious days of LucasArts. HOWEVER, this is not a great remaster. There are a lot of issues and laziness in this version. The new lighting effect and developer commentary are nice, but everything else in the update is questionable technically.\n\nFirst, as a remaster in HD era, it doesn't have legit resolution options. The game is at a 4:3 resolution at default (probably 1024*768) with two bars on the sides to fill up the rest of the screen. You can change the ratio to 16:9, but it only stretches the 4:3 ratio graphics laterally which makes everything look fat.\n\nThen, the controller support. This control scheme works just fine although you cannot rebind it or adjust it in any way, but it has two irritating flaws: First, the game only shows button prompts of a PS4 controller even I'm using an X360 one. Second, the game does not tell you where the interactable items are if you play it with controller. It has the potential to make puzzles more frustrating than they should be.\n\nThe game does not have autosave feature. Yup, Double Fine kindly asks you to deal with it. The original does not have this feature too, but I don't see the point of not adding it in the remaster. Losing a large chunk of progress after lengthy play time because of forgetting to save is one of the most frustrating thing in gaming. The thing I find insulting is that they added a notification says "there's no autosave in the game, please save your progress frequently". So the developer knows that no autosave can hurt the experience, but they did not bother to add it anyway?\n\nOverall, still a great game as it is, but the remaster stinks with low effort. I guess Double Fine just slapped in controller support, new lighting and developer commentary and called it a day without doing any upgrade to make the game feel just a little bit more modern. It feels like an emulator game honestly. What's the point of remastering it if there's barely any improved features? For some reason, the file size is almost 4 gigs while the original is no more than 1 gig if I recall correctly. The 15 dollars asking price hardly feels reasonable.\n\nI can't believe I'm saying this, but what the fxxk happened to you, Double Fine?","January 27, 2015","true","2.2"," 36 of 68 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","36","68","5","0"

Little baby Sherlock loved playing games with his family. They played Heart of Darkness, The Curse of Monkey Island and the Tomb Raider games, and they had a really good time. But one day, a new game entered the household: Grim Fandango. It came out in 1998 and was developed by LucasArts. Baby Sherlock had never seen a game like that: he was too little to fully understand what was going on in the game, but he kept playing it until he discovered a game breaking bug half-way through the game, and little Sherlock was not able to further proceed through the game. The years went by, and Sherlock stopped playing Grim Fandango. He played many more games, but he never forgot Grim Fandango: the desire to actually complete the game the understand the story grew day after day, week after week, year after year. Than, in June 2014, an announcement was made: Grim Fandango was being remastered for PC, PS4 and Playstation Vita by Double Fine, creators of Psychonauts, Brutal Legends and other great games. Sherlock was thrilled to play the game, and Double Fine gave him an immense honour: to play and review a press copy of the game.\n\nGrim Fandango takes place in the Land of the Dead, where recently departed souls aim to make their way to the Ninth Underworld. Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead, these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.\n\nManny Calavera, our protagonist, is a travel agent at the Department of Death. After always getting clients that must take the four-year journey and being threatened to be fired, he decides to steal the new client of his co-worker Domino Hurley. Said client is Merchedes Colomar, who is apparently a good person who made good deeds in life. However, the computer of the Department assigns her the four-year journey. But Manny believes that she should've taken the Number Nine, because of the pureness of her heart. So, Manny embarks on a journey trying to save Merchedes, while also unravelling a sinister plot constructed by the Department of Death with an underworld mob boss, Hector LeMans.\n\nAfter having fully experienced this game for the first time in my life, I can safely say that this is a masterpiece. And that is not a word that I often use. The story is an homage to the Mexican afterlife and film noir. The story is really well paced, with brilliant writing, great twist and turns and an authentic noir feel.\n\nThe game is unchanged from the original version in terms of story. There are, however, some new additions. Most notably, the character textures and the lightning: the characters models are polished to perfection, and the enhanced lightning casts shadows on the environment making everything look more pleasing to the eye. If you are an hardcore fan, or someone with a low-end computer, you can change the graphics by simply pushing a button. But you have probably noticed, by watching this video, that that is the only change in terms of graphics: unlike the remastered versions of the Monkey Island games, the background is still the same.\n\nThe same goes for the fantastic soundtrack and voice acting: the tracks haven't been updated, so in a couple of occasions you will notice that they aren't all that polished. But aside from that, the game is impeccable.\n\nThe game is a classic point-and-click adventure, and, unlike previous games from LucasArts, most of the puzzles feel challenging but never frustrating or impossible to complete. Be wary: if you don't like puzzles and you want a more story-driven game, I don't think that this game is for you. Sure, you can still look at a walkthrough, but the best parts of the game are the immense levels with plenty of charismatic characters to interact with, with my favourite being the demon Glottis.\n\nThe game also features developer commentary with the original creators, as well as 47 achievements that will make you want to replay the game multiple times. The game fully supports the controller on PC, and the controls are really intuitive.\n\nOverall, this is a classic adventure game with a funny and thought-provoking noir story, a tremendous cast of characters, a lovely soundtrack and plenty of hours of gameplay. If you have never played Grim Fandango, now is the time to buy it.\n\nStory: 10\nGraphics: 8\nGameplay: 9.5\nChallenge: 9\nSound: 10\nReplayability: 9\n\nENJOYMENT: 10\nFRUSTRATION: 3\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","January 27, 2015","true","8.1"," 23 of 43 people (53%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","53","23","43","12","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/recommended/316790/","lesalanos","Trip Hazard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/","382 products in account","What's there to say about Grim Fandango that hasn't already been said? I don’t think I need to recount how, despite a sterling critical reception, it sold so poorly that it signalled the - mercifully temporary - death of the P’n’C genre. This game about death, starring a bunch of skeletons on a mission to reclaim their rightful destiny. Now, in this remastered version, given a second chance at un-life, have they finally done it?\n\nAye, I suppose they have. Let me explain.\n\nOkay, so Grim Fandango is a great game, we all know this. The sultry dialogue sizzles with attitude, the characters are desperate and devious, lovable and loathsome. The performances are top of the class, seriously.\n\nIt’s flawed, yeah. Oh yeah, it’s flawed as hell. After a strong start in the art deco masterpiece that is El Marrow, you’ve got a short, silly section in some brown woods with a bunch of trial and error puzzles. Then Rubacava, a massive area, with more interesting characters than I’ve space to list. A place you’ll really lose yourself, speaking both metaphorically and literally (it is a big area…)\n\nAnd then more trial and error ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ a bit later on, and the denouement, which is just too small and brief to leave much of an impression. I don’t want to give too much away, so excuse me if I sound like I’m being flippant, or overly critical. There aren’t any truly terrible parts, but it’s inconsistent. There are signs that parts of the game have been rushed, and there are some puzzles that it might have been better off just leaving out entirely. But, I can’t think of any other adventure games which don’t have rough spots and dodgy puzzles. The highs of Grim Fandango are higher than most other games of this type. I don't mean to be fawning, but this game has a lot of soul.\n\nSo, what have they changed with this remastered version? The biggest thing is that now it’s entirely playable with the mouse! Nice! I’m not sure it was so terrible having to play with the keyboard, but hey, it’s good to have the option. Probably I’m a weird anomaly ‘cos I played with a controller anyway, but that worked fine, so yeah, thumbs up there.\n\nThen there’s the textures. They’ve been redone, at much higher res than before. They look alright but it doesn’t make that much difference really, when most characters are just suit and skull, or boiler suit and fat orange arms. There’s also some shadowing thrown in, but literally the only place I noticed it was in Manny’s office, in front of the venetian blinds. Grim Fandango looked fine, it didn’t need to be prettied up, but it would be churlish to complain, really.\n\nThe big draw about this edition is dead simple. You can buy it. You can’t buy the old one, and haven’t been able to for some time. But, now you can, and that’s wonderful. Even better, there’s an option in most areas to listen to director’s commentary, enlightening chat from some of the finest minds in the industry. And Tim Schafer.\n\nAnd, did I mention that the music has been entirely redone? It’s all orchestrated now, and that’s worth the asking price alone.","March 24","true","8.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Welcome to the Land of the Death, you've done something bad in previous life and are stuck trying to sell travel-packages to the afterlife to newly deceased. However something's very fishy in the biz...\nA point&click adventure oozing with style and creativity, however the remaster is only applicable on the characters (better 3d-models), sound and movement. Backgrounds were untouched.\nOverall time i spend for 1 playthrough is 11 hours, and I played through this game several years ago about 5 times, so guessing 20-30 hours if never played.\nA delicious mix of Aztec culture with Jazz and art-deco/nouveau and film noir, added with demons and cat-races (!)\n\nI recommend this title not only as a classical pillar in the genre, but also as a bridge between the old and new. If you want to play the old Sierra and Lucasarts titles start with this one.","July 13, 2015","true","11.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/subjectinfinite/recommended/316790/","subjectinfinite","Subject Infinite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/subjectinfinite/","288 products in account","Grim Fandango is a timeless classic.\n\nWell mostly, it has the odd 90's reference in it which may be a little difficult to understand for the younger audience. But the world of Grim Fandango is rich, vibrant, funny and just an all round good piece of work. The story is extremely well told, and the puzzles are a great example of the 90's era point and click puzzle adventures.\n\nDespite being the remastered version the graphics probably haven't held up to the ravages of time - but they have their charm. Think of it is a period piece. They're supposed to look like that! But technical aspects aside, the art direction is pretty great with a wonderful day-of-the-dead/Art Deco world, constructed with the perfect belnd of the macabre and the colourful. There's a nice soundtrack too, it is very fitting.\n\nThe characters are as you would expect from LucasArts in their prime. Well written, funny, fleshed out (pun intended). The story is fun too, perhaps nothing groundbreaking in this day and age but it's great for what it is - and it really is unique. I can't think of anything else quite like it. Manny Calavera is a brilliant protagonist, and his interactions with the other characters is a real highlight of the game. Every character is interesting, from their name right to their motivations.\n\nThe attention to detail is also worth noting. There's dialogue with random characters sometimes of no real consquence other than to perhaps provide further clues to follow, or just no reason at all. It just helps build the world, and it's backstory at times. There's also little snippets of dialogue for random actions you do with items you find, as if they knew you'd misuse the item. It's really a lot of fun to seek out the dialogue.\n\nThe gameplay is where the review gets a little messy. As was a hallmark of games at the time, some puzzles could be unreasonably difficult. You'd consult a walkthrough and think 'How was I supposed to know to do that?!'. THe odd puzzle can seem unintuitive. This may not be a problem, but when you tie it in with a key strength of the game in that the puzzles are tie together - not being able to solve one can leave you hopelessly lost. In my case, I simply overlooked a small item in Rubacava which essentially tied all the puzzle arcs together in that area. I'm not sure how far this is a negative criticism, or if it is a fair warning to this genre of game from this period. If you grew up playing these games you probably know what to expect. If not, then best of luck to you.\n\nIf I would pick out a glaring problem with the remastered version, it's the controller controls. The game works perfectly with a mouse, and my recommendation would be to rely on that. THe controller certainly has it's advantages as walking around the world is much smoother and free with the analogue stick, but it's really not great at all for exploring active items in areas. It's so easy to overlook or flat out miss an object because you haven't positioned yourself correctly with a controller. WIth the mouse, simply hovering it over an object will let you know if it's something you can interact with. I found myself using my wireless controler and wireless mouse in the end, to great success.\n\nOverall, an incredibly charming and challenging game, perhaps an artifact from a bygone era of PC gaming when you could really feel the personal touch of the developers in their game design and the community felt a little bit more exclusive for being in on some of the in jokes. Gaming has come a long way since then and in my eyes has only gotten better with time. Nowadays, I feel we have spiritual successors; truly great story driven games like Tales from the Walking Dead, or Life is Strange, carrying the torch in their own way (and enhanced with technology which wasn't possible back then) passed on from LucasArts even after it seemed like that fire had long extinguished.","September 8, 2015","true","16.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Having played the original over 10 years ago I was really looking forward to this re-master but unfortunately won't be able to unless I upgrade to a brand new pc or ps4. Not being technically minded I thought that a modern pc that can play blu-ray discs and loads of up-to-date games would be able to handle Grim Fandango but according to the GF community my graphics card (Intel HD family) is already out of date and worst of all, non-upgradeable! So, unless the developers release the original without Open GL 3.3 (Had never even heard of Open GL before this problem) my download of this game will amount to little more than a desktop icon of Manny Calavera, not great value for a £10.99 download!

Yes, it's a shame there weren't new models, but once you get over that, you enjoy how faithful it is. Plus you now have POINT AND CLICK controls, like a traditional graphic adventure.

I'm sure you've read all the flowery reviews and the hype behind the game's revival. It's all true and the game is worth the investment for the witty dialogue alone, but does it play well?\n\nAdapted to newer audiences with a directional control scheme, mouse controls, and all that jazz, the game probably fails there as a port. Using the directional buttons alone makes controlling Manny a nightmare, especially when you're walking through camera angle shifts that do a 180. The mouse button controls aren't quite as intuitive either, so that's an impediment too. Basically, the game, as the achievement says, is "meant to be played" with tank controls. That's just it. It's probably not a control set up that makes sense to some people, but once you learn it, it works far better.\n\nSo is it "broken" as Wired called it? Well, no. I wouldn't call it broken, perhaps, a little buggy.\n\nI will commend the updated graphics though.

I haven't played the original so i really can't compare or tell you who have played the original to pay for a Remastered version and say it is worth it (which i probably think anyway) but to me who haven't played the original, I definitly recommend this game to anyone who want's a casual click and point game, who happends to be one of the best.\n\nThe story is awsome and intense and never gets boring throughout the game. It keeps the intrerest all the time and that is an rarity in adventure games. The puzzles are great too, sometimes i feel though that the puzzles doesn't make sense at all, leaving you confused for like an eternity, but it encourage you to keep on moving. The art and design in this game is beautifull aswell, and everything combine makes the game really realistic. I mean cmon, everyone is a skeleton/demon in this game and they have succsesfully made so female skeletons look  HOT  . I love that.\nThe soundtrack is great and in the remastered version the soundtrack is even better. It's music that you want to stop your character and just stay and listen to.\n\nOf course like any other game, this game has it's "cons". Buggy movement controls and the camera angles can be a little frustrating.\n\nBut I love this game for it's art, iconic characters and storyline. Enter the Day of the Dead and unveil the mystery of your workplace Department of the Dead as Manny Cavalera.","November 15, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's unique setting, quality voicework, writing, and highly stylized presentation charmed the bones off everyone and those aspects hold up extremely well today.  What does not hold up as well is the somewhat clunky gameplay and nonsensical puzzles.  This does not mean it isn't fun, but the great puzzlers and adventure games of today clearly leave the "combine everything/try to use everything on everything" style of puzzle-solving in the grave.\n\nIn this game, you are Manuel Calavera.  A guy that died and went to heaven the Land of the Dead, which is more or less a type of Purgatory.  You are a Grim Reaper, which in this world, means you are a travel advisor for the newly dead.  Your goal, and just about everyone's, is to find your final rest.  Your predictable unlife quickly comes loose, however, after meeting a gorgeous dead dame and a world of corruption is opened up to you like the yawning grave.  It is very much a twist on the classic noir mystery, full of murder, demons, odd jobs, hollow bones, and hot rods.\n\nThe "Remastered" in the title is very apt, as you should think of this as a "remastered edition" of an old movie.  Very little about the gameplay has changed other than the addition of point-and-click movement.  The art is not dramatically changed but simply given a crisp make-over.  Even then, it still looks its age.  Since the game is so stylized, however, it is by no means ugly.\n\nFandango into El Marrow if...\n\nYou pine for the days of LucasArts.\nYou have an interest in Día de Muertos themes.\nLove noir style mysteries.\nEnjoy a good story-based adventure game.\nKeep your skin suit on if...\n\nYou strongly prefer logic-oriented puzzles.\nAre averse to late 90s visuals.\nDislike point-and-click style adventure games.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis is a great game to pick up both if you've never played it before or if you're wanting to relive the memories.  It has a beautiful story that you'll fondly remember for years afterward.  That said, a lot of the puzzles are fairly obtuse and there haven't been many extras tossed in other than the improved visuals and commentary.  Unfortunately, there were even several bugs that presented themselves - including one that was a game breaker - at multiple times during my playthrough.  Because of this, I do not find Grim Fandango Remastered particularly remarkable in the "remaster/remake/reboot" category of gaming.  Fortunately for Grim Fandango's sake, the story, art, and humor made it completely easy for me to overlook these annoying quibbles.\n\nA must play in my opinion, no bones about it.","December 28, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mainly making the game supported for modern systems. Back in the day 4:3 ratio was norm with the CRT monitors. Considering the techniques used back in the day, with a minimal use of 3D, all the backgrounds and environments are pre-rendered stills and the cutscenes are pre-rendered videos, so scaling it to modern ratios would mean remaking all of those. To counter that they went with adding bars on either side of the screen. Hence it's a 'remaster' and not a 'remake'.\n\nHowever the textures for the live 3D models have been upped and shadows are cast onto it and from it and audio sounds high quality.\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b3/Grim_fandango_remastered_comparison.png\n\nGrim FandangoThe game, a point-and-click adventure, builds its story around the protagonist Manuel (Manny) Calavera, a travel agent in the land of the dead for the the Department of Dead in a town called El Marrow to pay off his dept to reach the better afterlife. As a travel agent he picks up clients from the land of the living that just died and tries to sell them the best and quickest ticket to that 9th Underworld afterlife, equivalent to heaven, as possible. But time after time he seems to be unable to get the good leads, while his co-worker Domino Hurley seems to get all the good ones. When it dawns on Manny that things aren't right, he tries to get to the bottom of it.\n\nThe puzzles are kinda 'old-skool', what often can result in scanning the entire scene for anything to interact with and trying every item. If you finally figure it out, or you cannot resist to read a walkthrough, it's either "Wow! That's far-fetched!" or "Wow! Now I get it! It's so direct and simple that I didn't think of it!". There is a simple linear inventory system without the possibility (or requirement) to combine things, like that's the case in the Monkey Island series.\n\nThe story is fun and engaging with a fair amount of comical puns to keep you entertained, even if you play it with a walkthrough, for a good 10-13 hours.","December 24, 2015","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of the times the solution I had missed had been obvious, had I paid more attention, but sometimes I was wondering how I was supposed to think of that... Still, lots of fun, just like with the good old SCUMM games.\n\nGFRemastered offers the option to turn on character-related controls instead of the braindead camera-related controls and I still can't understand how anyone ever thought the original control scheme was a good idea. The new mouse UI makes things even smoother, as you can scan the hotspots instead of slowly walking around the world trying to see when Manuel moves his head towards something.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/manfromthewall/recommended/316790/","manfromthewall","manfromthewall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/manfromthewall/","97 products in account","One of the last graphic adventure games LucasArts ever released (the other being Escape From Monkey Island), Grim Fandango had intrigued me for a long while, given the fanfare it has been given, but I never got around to playing it. Now, with the remastered version released, and with compatibility with modern-day systems, I've gotten another chance to try it out.\n\nGraphics:\nTechnically, I didn't think Grim Fandango's graphics seemed too special, even when compared to other games from 1998. It uses 3D models for its characters and a few items, rendered on top of pre-rendered backgrounds, which was common to do back in those days. Nowadays, it's painfully obvious the backgrounds are pre-rendered, and the jerkiness/bugginess in some of the animations can be quite off-putting. The remastered version has overhauled graphics, but disappointingly, they weren't majorly overhauled, so the game still looks pretty close to what it did in 1998, but slightly crisper.\n\nDespite this, I still found the presentation of the game to be very nice, with a very distinct Mexican and Dia de Muertos theme (I've not seen the latter style in too many games). Having this rather unique look helps to mask the rather average technical graphics a bit, since it's obvious the aim wasn't for realistic graphics, and the style is different enough that it grabs your attention.\n\nMusic:\nLucasArts back in the day tended to really deliver in the music department for their games, and Grim Fandango is no exception in that regard. The music fits very well with the Mexican and film-noir atmosphere the game is trying to portray, really adding to the overall experience. I've read that Double Fine rerecorded the soundtrack for this game, using an orchestra rather than midi, but given that I didn't play the original, I can't really comment on that. One feature in the music that past LucasArts games had that this seemed to lack was the iMuse engine, which was used to smoothly transition instruments from one midi track to another in older LucasArts games. Still, it was not a big deal, overall.\n\nGameplay:\nThe original game used tank controls to move around and interact with items, which was simply a way to easily address how navigation would work in a 3D environment. Again, several games during this age was like that, like the Resident Evil games. I've always felt that control scheme was really clunky. However, given that this is a remaster, Double Fine put in some more user-friendly control schemes, like an analog control system (up moves up, left moves left, etc), and a point-and-click system (like old graphic adventure games). This was a really welcome change, and made playing the game a lot more intuitive.\n\nI do feel like there was one area where Double Fine could have done more work, and that was the inventory system. In Grim Fandango, to take out an item from your inventory, you had to go to inventory mode, have Manny show you one item he has in his inventory, and cycle through each individual item (going through the animation of Manny picking out the item from his jacket) until you find one you need, and then take it out. It might have been good for a cinematic effect, or as a cheap way to not render all items at once, but it was extremely tedious to have to cycle through each item, instead of just picking one out right away. Even in past LucasArts games, in the inventory screen, you were presented with all (or several) of your items at once, and you just picked the one you wanted to use.\n\nStory:\nThis is the real meat of any graphic adventure game. Grim Fandango is set in the Land of the Dead, which is essentially one stage of the afterlife, where recently deceased souls try and make their way into what is known as the Ninth Underworld, which is the next stage of the afterlife. You play as Manny Calavera, a travel agent at the Department of Death, responsible for bringing souls of the recently departed to the Land of the Dead, and arranging for ways they can reach the Ninth Underworld, based on how good they were in life. In other words, you're a Grim Reaper. Manny has been forced into this job to work off a debt (of unknown origin to the player) before he, himself, can proceed to the Ninth Underworld, but the lack of good clients being fed to him barely do much to help his cause. He eventually tries to take matters into his own hands to get a good client for his cause, but soon gets dragged into something much bigger by doing so.\n\nIn usual LucasArts fare, this game doesn't take itself all-too seriously, and has quite a bit of humor to it, which is always appreciated. That is not to say the story is not strong; in fact, far from it. Grim Fandango has a very engaging story, with many memorable and likable characters.\n\nI suppose one problem I found in the characters is that, at times, there is a lack of conclusion regarding some of the ones you meet in the game. For some of them, they have a clearly established relation with you in some way, but after clearing certain parts of the game (and partially due to the presence of time-jumps), you don't really know what happens to them, and you never really see them again. It felt pretty weird, as I really wanted to know what happened to some of these characters, but once the game ends, you only really know what happens to you and a few other people. This may be a testament to how well this game is able to establish a lore and its characters, as by the game's end, it leaves you wanting to know more about those characters and the world you just left.\n\nConclusion:\nI would definitely recommend this game to any fan of the graphic adventure genre, especially if you've never played the original version before. Although I feel for a remaster, a lot more could have been done (especially for the graphics and inventory system), Grim Fandango remains an absolute classic, and still holds up quite well today.","September 28, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sometimes because of a glitch, I would have to go to my last saved game, which you must do often manually or risk losing hours of work because of a random glitch.\n\nThe new graphics are a minor improvement but the art style is what really helps give the game a timeless look.

Pick up any object and use it on any other person or object and, behold, the developers have a joke for that. The characters and dialogue are extremely funny and likeable and you get a genuine rush every time you solve a puzzle.\n\nThat being said, several of the puzzles are frustratingly difficult and some, for me at least, require a walk-through as the answer isn't obvious even after the puzzle has been solved. However, there is never a, 'no-win,' situation, so you can always try a puzzle again, or go back to a saved file to save time.\n\nOverall, a great game that you will thoroughly enjoy no matter how frustrating it may get.\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/manfromthewall/recommended/316790/","manfromthewall","manfromthewall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/manfromthewall/","97 products in account","One of the last graphic adventure games LucasArts ever released (the other being Escape From Monkey Island), Grim Fandango had intrigued me for a long while, given the fanfare it has been given, but I never got around to playing it. Now, with the remastered version released, and with compatibility with modern-day systems, I've gotten another chance to try it out.\n\nGraphics:\nTechnically, I didn't think Grim Fandango's graphics seemed too special, even when compared to other games from 1998. It uses 3D models for its characters and a few items, rendered on top of pre-rendered backgrounds, which was common to do back in those days. Nowadays, it's painfully obvious the backgrounds are pre-rendered, and the jerkiness/bugginess in some of the animations can be quite off-putting. The remastered version has overhauled graphics, but disappointingly, they weren't majorly overhauled, so the game still looks pretty close to what it did in 1998, but slightly crisper.\n\nDespite this, I still found the presentation of the game to be very nice, with a very distinct Mexican and Dia de Muertos theme (I've not seen the latter style in too many games). Having this rather unique look helps to mask the rather average technical graphics a bit, since it's obvious the aim wasn't for realistic graphics, and the style is different enough that it grabs your attention.\n\nMusic:\nLucasArts back in the day tended to really deliver in the music department for their games, and Grim Fandango is no exception in that regard. The music fits very well with the Mexican and film-noir atmosphere the game is trying to portray, really adding to the overall experience. I've read that Double Fine rerecorded the soundtrack for this game, using an orchestra rather than midi, but given that I didn't play the original, I can't really comment on that. One feature in the music that past LucasArts games had that this seemed to lack was the iMuse engine, which was used to smoothly transition instruments from one midi track to another in older LucasArts games. Still, it was not a big deal, overall.\n\nGameplay:\nThe original game used tank controls to move around and interact with items, which was simply a way to easily address how navigation would work in a 3D environment. Again, several games during this age was like that, like the Resident Evil games. I've always felt that control scheme was really clunky. However, given that this is a remaster, Double Fine put in some more user-friendly control schemes, like an analog control system (up moves up, left moves left, etc), and a point-and-click system (like old graphic adventure games). This was a really welcome change, and made playing the game a lot more intuitive.\n\nI do feel like there was one area where Double Fine could have done more work, and that was the inventory system. In Grim Fandango, to take out an item from your inventory, you had to go to inventory mode, have Manny show you one item he has in his inventory, and cycle through each individual item (going through the animation of Manny picking out the item from his jacket) until you find one you need, and then take it out. It might have been good for a cinematic effect, or as a cheap way to not render all items at once, but it was extremely tedious to have to cycle through each item, instead of just picking one out right away. Even in past LucasArts games, in the inventory screen, you were presented with all (or several) of your items at once, and you just picked the one you wanted to use.\n\nStory:\nThis is the real meat of any graphic adventure game. Grim Fandango is set in the Land of the Dead, which is essentially one stage of the afterlife, where recently deceased souls try and make their way into what is known as the Ninth Underworld, which is the next stage of the afterlife. You play as Manny Calavera, a travel agent at the Department of Death, responsible for bringing souls of the recently departed to the Land of the Dead, and arranging for ways they can reach the Ninth Underworld, based on how good they were in life. In other words, you're a Grim Reaper. Manny has been forced into this job to work off a debt (of unknown origin to the player) before he, himself, can proceed to the Ninth Underworld, but the lack of good clients being fed to him barely do much to help his cause. He eventually tries to take matters into his own hands to get a good client for his cause, but soon gets dragged into something much bigger by doing so.\n\nIn usual LucasArts fare, this game doesn't take itself all-too seriously, and has quite a bit of humor to it, which is always appreciated. That is not to say the story is not strong; in fact, far from it. Grim Fandango has a very engaging story, with many memorable and likable characters.\n\nI suppose one problem I found in the characters is that, at times, there is a lack of conclusion regarding some of the ones you meet in the game. For some of them, they have a clearly established relation with you in some way, but after clearing certain parts of the game (and partially due to the presence of time-jumps), you don't really know what happens to them, and you never really see them again. It felt pretty weird, as I really wanted to know what happened to some of these characters, but once the game ends, you only really know what happens to you and a few other people. This may be a testament to how well this game is able to establish a lore and its characters, as by the game's end, it leaves you wanting to know more about those characters and the world you just left.\n\nConclusion:\nI would definitely recommend this game to any fan of the graphic adventure genre, especially if you've never played the original version before. Although I feel for a remaster, a lot more could have been done (especially for the graphics and inventory system), Grim Fandango remains an absolute classic, and still holds up quite well today.","September 28, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now as a 29 year old and much more experience in adventure games I bought the remastered version and once again stepped into the world of Manny Calavera. I finished the game in a little over 6 hours because I remembered 90% of storyline and the puzzle solving. Then played the game once more to get all the achievements and enabling the Directors commentary.\n\nSo is this game worth the money? Absolutely, even when you have played the game in the past. The humor, the strong storyline, the characters (Glottis!) eveything is just as great as it was. Okay if I have to name one thing that should've been fixed it's the controls when switching from scene to scene. If you are walking left and the camera pitch changes you suddenly was the other way for instance.\n\nIt's one of the best adventure games ever made and with this (digital) release you can pick it up every 4 years or so.\n\nViva la Revolución!","June 29, 2015","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I still remembered a good bunch of scenes, jokes and puzzles.\nI do admit that more than once I got stuck and had to rely on the not that fun "iterate through every scene, talk about everything with everyone, use everything on everything else and everyone else until you accidentally solve the current issue" a few times. Most of the times the solution I had missed had been obvious, had I paid more attention, but sometimes I was wondering how I was supposed to think of that... Still, lots of fun, just like with the good old SCUMM games.\n\nGFRemastered offers the option to turn on character-related controls instead of the braindead camera-related controls and I still can't understand how anyone ever thought the original control scheme was a good idea. The new mouse UI makes things even smoother, as you can scan the hotspots instead of slowly walking around the world trying to see when Manuel moves his head towards something. Still, sometimes pressing enter in the right place solved something I had missed with the mouse.\n\nHeartily recommended to anyone without AD/HD.","April 4","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story - and setting are both top notch.\nGrim is at heart, a point and click adventure game, but as it's 3D (one of the pioneers when first released), it was seen as somewhat different- especially with the "tank controls" that the later Lucasarts games started to add.\n\nVoice acting, music and sound is GREAT.\n\nPuzzles in this game get very difficult, nonsenical.  At times triggers are done at what seems to be random, where dialogue options open up randomly, or when you can use an object.  The feeling of knowing what you want to do, but not knowing exactly what is needed to start the sequence...  Grrnnnnnngg!!  Half way through the adventure it had me look up FAQ guides online- finishing the game only to see the story.  The fun had turned into frustration ;/\n\n---\nThe remaster adds developer commentary to scenes, concept art, new character models, new control scheme (mouse!), and wide-screen support.\n\nWhilst many of these are welcome, it doesn't feel as a "remaster" should.\nThe character models look almost out of place, infront of the (now) blurry lower resolution backgrounds- even a simple contrast / brightness photoshop touchup would've been welcome.\nDev commentary was brilliant throughout.\n\nIt was obvious that they learnt a lot of things with the Monkey remasters, but also it feels like the team did a semi-lazy job.\n\nRating ; 3/5\n- Recommended for anyone veteran or skilled in Lucasarts adventure games.  For anyone else, start with MI!\n\nBugs encountered,\n- Keyboard controls sticking, not idle when afk (often)\n- Manny model doing odd things (arm's waving around, odd things)\n\nAdditional note;  I'm unsure if I should hit "yes" or "no" to recommend this.

Is there a greater constant in nature than the treachery of women?"\nGrim Fandango  is the very pioneer of click and point adventures games. Loved by almost everyone and alot of people say's it is one of the greatest games of all time.\nI agree to some points, but i am from a generation where games like these were not so popular.\nDespite that, I love this game. It's charming, it has drama, mystery, alot of humor, and with this remastered version, it looks kinda fresh. I haven't played the original so i really can't compare or tell you who have played the original to pay for a Remastered version and say it is worth it (which i probably think anyway) but to me who haven't played the original, I definitly recommend this game to anyone who want's a casual click and point game, who happends to be one of the best.\n\nThe story is awsome and intense and never gets boring throughout the game. It keeps the intrerest all the time and that is an rarity in adventure games. The puzzles are great too, sometimes i feel though that the puzzles doesn't make sense at all, leaving you confused for like an eternity, but it encourage you to keep on moving. The art and design in this game is beautifull aswell, and everything combine makes the game really realistic. I mean cmon, everyone is a skeleton/demon in this game and they have succsesfully made so female skeletons look  HOT  . I love that.\nThe soundtrack is great and in the remastered version the soundtrack is even better. It's music that you want to stop your character and just stay and listen to.\n\nOf course like any other game, this game has it's "cons". Buggy movement controls and the camera angles can be a little frustrating.\n\nBut I love this game for it's art, iconic characters and storyline.

It's unique setting, quality voicework, writing, and highly stylized presentation charmed the bones off everyone and those aspects hold up extremely well today.  What does not hold up as well is the somewhat clunky gameplay and nonsensical puzzles.  This does not mean it isn't fun, but the great puzzlers and adventure games of today clearly leave the "combine everything/try to use everything on everything" style of puzzle-solving in the grave.\n\nIn this game, you are Manuel Calavera.  A guy that died and went to heaven the Land of the Dead, which is more or less a type of Purgatory.  You are a Grim Reaper, which in this world, means you are a travel advisor for the newly dead.  Your goal, and just about everyone's, is to find your final rest.  Your predictable unlife quickly comes loose, however, after meeting a gorgeous dead dame and a world of corruption is opened up to you like the yawning grave.  It is very much a twist on the classic noir mystery, full of murder, demons, odd jobs, hollow bones, and hot rods.\n\nThe "Remastered" in the title is very apt, as you should think of this as a "remastered edition" of an old movie.  Very little about the gameplay has changed other than the addition of point-and-click movement.  The art is not dramatically changed but simply given a crisp make-over.  Even then, it still looks its age.  Since the game is so stylized, however, it is by no means ugly.\n\nFandango into El Marrow if...\n\nYou pine for the days of LucasArts.\nYou have an interest in Día de Muertos themes.\nLove noir style mysteries.\nEnjoy a good story-based adventure game.\nKeep your skin suit on if...\n\nYou strongly prefer logic-oriented puzzles.\nAre averse to late 90s visuals.\nDislike point-and-click style adventure games.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis is a great game to pick up both if you've never played it before or if you're wanting to relive the memories.  It has a beautiful story that you'll fondly remember for years afterward.  That said, a lot of the puzzles are fairly obtuse and there haven't been many extras tossed in other than the improved visuals and commentary.  Unfortunately, there were even several bugs that presented themselves - including one that was a game breaker - at multiple times during my playthrough.  Because of this, I do not find Grim Fandango Remastered particularly remarkable in the "remaster/remake/reboot" category of gaming.  Fortunately for Grim Fandango's sake, the story, art, and humor made it completely easy for me to overlook these annoying quibbles.\n\nA must play in my opinion, no bones about it.","December 28, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now few crash may happen, at least it happened to me in random situations, so all I had to do was load my game back and go ahead.\n- Achievements bugs. I had to talk with Chepito something like 10 times before i got that damn Drill Achievement... And I heard from the community this isn't the only bug.\n- Requirements.

The dialogue and content is still awesome, but the graphics shows a bit of age.\n\nThis is an old Lucasarts Adventure from 1998, that has been upgraded with a sorely missed point and click interface and a few visual improvements of the original graphics as well as compatibility with systems of this day and age, that has also increased the system requirements, but It still looks, sounds and plays the same way as the original game, but.. actually even better than that.\n\nTo me it really looks the same as it once did, because when I first played this game in 1998 it was on a 15" monitor, where the game was looking really great and I also had a 3Dfx Addon at the time. It doesn't look quite as great on a screen twice the size, but it's still a hell of a lot better than it would be to play the original in DOSBOX not to mention that a few bugs has been fixed as well. It has really become much easier to play than the original game.\n\nAdditions:\n\n+ New point and click interface (with a Skull Panel for Look, Use & Pickup).\n+ Visual enhancements of the Original graphics.\n+ Developer commentary.\n+ Concept art gallery.\n+ Steam achievements.\n+ A few bug fixes.\n\nThere is also an option to change the display ratio from 4:3 to 16:9, but since that is simply a horizontal stretch I don't count that as an improvement, but it actually makes the game nicer, even though there is a bit of distortion in dark areas. It's a better game than the original thanks to the point and click interface, but there are a few disadvantages, because they have..\n\nRemoved:\n\n- Unlimited save slots - there is a max of eight now, which means, that you can't make saves at every "turn" and that's actually pretty annoying, especially if you want to get the achievements.\n\n- Grimlogs are gone and the ingame equivalent of a dialogue transcripts is really too slow to scroll through. The Escape key will skip all dialogue and there were a few times I skipped something I shouldn't have and got a bit lost about the goals and it was a hell to backtrack the log.\n\nFixes:\n\nA few bug fixes and restoration of dialogue. I've noticed a few puzzles that have become easier to click in place also because there are no CPU speed coupling issues anymore.\n\nThe puzzles are generally pretty straight forward and a bit funny and crazy at times, but there is no narrative or hint system and absolutely no hand-holding of any kind other than Manny's head turning towards points of interest, which also means that have to move around a lot to spot those items and use the Examine key unless you want to go pixel-hunting, because not every point has a cursor. There are often additional dialogue and events happening from simply examing someone or something.\n\nUnlike other Adventure games there is no glow effect to highlight points of interest and sometimes those points blend in a bit too well with the environment. Once you've gotten used to using the mouse for a point-and-click-adventure it's much easier to miss all those points of interest, because it can be a little hard to tell what Manny is looking at. I had to google for hints a few times, because I simply failed to notice a few items.\n\nNot every puzzle in the game is about advancing the plot. There are a few funny things that are just a bonus and add extra achievements. Unfortunately there are only eight save-game slots and thus it's a bit hard to manage saves in a way to go back and check later.\n\nThere are only three things that really bother me about this game. 1. It's such a wonderful game and it's too short. It takes about ten hours to complete this game, perhaps a bit more if you are completely new to the game. 2. No keys can be assigned to mouse buttons. I would have really liked to be able to assign a few actions to different buttons. 3. There are too many steps in moving from place to place. There is really a lot of moving around in the game, especially in Year 2 and the design can be a bit clunky at times in this regard. The only thing that is really missing from this great game is a map combined with fast-travel points. Bubbler: There is still a bit of aliasing left in the game, which unfortunately cannot be removed, not even by overriding settings or adding Morphological AA in the Catalyst Control Center. Maybe I should also mention that the game can't be minimized..\n\nI've played this game for a total of 30 hours, 2 ½ replays, tying up loose ends and the only time I ever had a problem was during an area transistion where I was running and zapping my way through the game in the end. Other than that single incident, which was a result of my own frantic clicking, I haven't had any issues, freezes, stutters, roadblocks or reasons to save the game at any time. I guess I am lucky or maybe I just have nice build of a system.\n\nI have been running this game in 16:9 on a system with Windows 8.1 x64, 12 GB RAM, Core i7-960, AMD 6930 1GB (14.12), ASUS Sabertooth X58 with Onboard Realtek ALC892 HD Audio, on a 256 GB Plextor M5S SSD. It's still a high-end system, even though it's somewhere in the middle of the bottom-half of that scale.\n\nThe game isn't demanding, but there is a limit. If you are on a shoddy system that just barely meet the extremely low minimum system requirements it's quite possible that you will have some issues, especially on a Mac or a system with Intel HD 4000.","January 30, 2015","true","35.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although the game was highly praised and given considerably good scores in reviews, the game’s sales were relatively unsuccessful, which indicated that other computer game genres might have been starting to generate more popularity than the traditional adventure game genre.\n\nDespite this, Grim Fandango is nothing short of a masterpiece that excellently captures the spirit of the 90s adventure games combined with the film noir vibe of crime and corruption through amazing dialogues and stunning visual art in the form of pre-rendered three-dimensional backgrounds, not to mention the incredibly creative rendition of the Aztec concepts of the afterlife.\n\nWith the remastered edition new players are able to be introduced to this amazingly composed game as well as allowing old player to re-experience the Land of the Dead and rememberable characters such as the reaper Manny Calavera and the crazily car-fixated demon Glottis on their journey to find the saint-like woman Mercedes Colomar and help to escort her safely through purgatory into the next life. If that wasn’t enough, the remastered version also come with in-game developer commentaries with people such as the project leader Tim Schafer and visual artist Peter Chan that will give you an insight in the process of creating computer games in the late 90s.\n\nAlthough Grim Fandango might not be a game fitted for everyone, it gives you a good insight in the late period of classic adventure games and offers you a rich story in terms of characters, visuals and dialogue, which could be a change of pace from today’s games, where you don’t try to figure out- and solve puzzles for hours on end in a charming world where dead men still tell their tale.","May 17","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Grim Fandango taking place at Land of the Dead is like a metaphor for the slow decline of graphics adventure genre in the last decade, but despite the ironic premise, this game brought more "life" and happiness into a bleak and dark world, both in-game and in reality.

Let's leave aside the nice soundtrack,the clever voice acting and the great/original plot; if you're going to buy this game you must be aware of some things first :\n\n1-This is NOT A REMASTER. AT ALL\nIt's an indecent port: bugs,common crashes are really frequent,try using several file saves at the same time to avoid being stuck in the worst moments and to be forced to restart the game (yes,i had this issue 3 times).\n\n2- Controls ARE SIMPLY AWFUL\nThose "tank controls" implemented here are well suited for a tank,indeed. This is a PaC adventure. Luckily,you'll be allowed to use mouse controls. However,be sure to be equipped with a good amount of patience.\n\n3- Camera angles and colours ARE INADEQUATE\nCamera angles are bad and they often swit in the worst moments while you're solving puzzles or walking around,making exploration a nighmare and the bad colouring makes some doors,rooms and key items impossible to be found or even spotted.\n\n4- Puzzles can be obscure,badly designed and often confusing.\nIf you're planning to play GF, then do it in a whole run,in 2-3 days,do not wait too much between playing sessions or you might find yourself lost and without any story recap and hints. Be sure to have a complete youtube walkthrough with you.\n\nTO SUM UP :\n\nIt's a decent written story with a clever sense of humour and "gore",be aware that this is a stupidly overpriced awful port. As suggested before,be sure to have a complete youtube walkthrough with you.","October 24, 2015","true","6.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

But every cut scene for me has the moments of blipping and stopping for split seconds, regardless if I shut everything else that was running on my pc or even turning the video settings down which is very limited on what you can adjust. Knowing from what I remember of the original game this has never had issues with the cut scenes like that and it worked fine on a much less speced computer back when it was originally released.\n\nI will continue playing this through however and see it right to the end for the nostalgia but I'm a tiny bit put off by the issue with the Cut secenes, So hopefully there is a hotfix that can be patched for this in the near future, I would still recommend this game because it's an amazing Classic and the storyline to it is one of my favorites :)","January 29, 2015","true","14.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

The struggles are real, but all worth it. Through thick and thin, sickness and health, till Death do us part - cha cha cha!\n\n\nGameplay: 93/100 A-\n\nThe Grim Fandango is one of the premier adventure games of all time and regarded as one of the best games ever made - period. The gameplay is pretty much the same as it was when it first came out: click to move here (Or if you enable "Tank Mode" you can use the D-Pad on a controller or your keys to move around), select an item, use it, pick it up, or whatever else needs to be done, and while this keeps the purity of the game, something deep down inside of me feels that there was a missed opportunity to streamline things a little or reinterpret them, BUT - this is just me nitpicking. The game still holds up and functions as good as modern titles and could easily pass as a new game altogether.\n\n\nAudio: 98/100 A+\n\nAt the time of its original release, Grim had a wonderful soundtrack, casting, and acting. All the characters were well developed and each were original and colorful, which shines even more in the remaster. Granted, the dialog isn't as flowing some more modern titles, but it still holds its own, a testament to the talent of Double Fine. The love and care taken in the sounds, script, every mannerism, joke, and acting really shows, down to the basic mouth movements that are synced in a way that almost seems motion captured in some way or another. To top it off, the style of its audio is distinct and instantly recognizable, something that is almost as hard as making a distinct game. Did I mention it has an awesome soundtrack?\n\n\nVisuals: 95/100 A\n\nIf this is your first encounter with Fandango, then you'd probably see it as an unimpressive game, even for an indie title and wouldn't bat another glance at it unless you had previous knowledge of the game's history and for those who played the original can more than attest to, there are a lot of improvements made, not just in smoothing out the pixels, higher resolutions, and brighter colors, but fixed most of the clipping, as well as making the backgrounds fuller in detail. The cutscenes too have been reworked to have smoother animations[1]. The Day of the Dead is also heavily influenced in the game as the clothes, music, and character designs reflect, adding to the comical, yet dark nature, of the game at times. Sometimes we forget that Death is part of life and that it is perfectly fine to laugh at it.\n\n\nStory: 99/100 A+\n\nGrim Fandango's story is one of the best around, not just in creativity, but how it presents itself, the sheer idea that when we die, our life status makes a difference in death, much like in classical Greek mythos. Take that and add satire, dark humor, and a well rounded cast of characters from all sorts of angles, all make for a really fun ride, start to finish. From the get go, things are poked and made fun of, such as the Grim Reaper being on stilts under his robe or how the agency competes over the deceased. They aren't things we, especially in western cultures, talk about in such a light, but if there was a case as to why we maybe should, Grim Fandango could very well lead the way on how to do that.\n\n\nContent: 99/100 A+\n\nLike most adventure games of the same vein, there is naturally a lot of content and things you can do within certain limits. Coupled with a great story to move things along, you'll find a lot to explore and talk about with the various characters in game as well as learning about everyone's motivations. And while it isn't necessarily the most complicated of games ever made, it is one that you'll have a hard time not playing with its wit and charm pulling you back in, hence why it was remastered in the first place. Now, there may not be much else added as far as the core game is concerned, but having a commentary mode is definitely a shining jewel for many out there who are curious about the inner workings of the game.\n\n\nDesign: 87/100 B+\n\nIt's really hard to improve upon the simplest of controls, especially one that requires minimal effort. There were a few issues involving click detection in trying to get your character to go in a particular direction or moving around in general, something games of this kind always have issues with, as well as some areas of the game being at odd angles making it a little hard to explore at times, though that could be on purpose. As I played my way through it, I found that this remaster was similar to another beloved remaster, The Shadow of Colossus and ICO, where the game wasn't changed much and difficult sections redone altogether, but the experience was brought into the modern age, a reminder of the potential of the medium, and in that regard, Double Fine have done a wonderful job.\n\n\nPerformance: 85/100 B\n\nThe game ran smoothly with very little lag or crashing at all. There were some issues with characters disappearing using the remastered settings, but that is something that'll get fixed eventually. Everything ran the way it ran when it came out and to some, that may not be a good thing, but again, this isn't a reimagining/recreation of a game, but a modernization. It's the HD version with added commentary or thoughts for modern machines without the need for tinkering from the original. It is most definitely not a reworking of Return of the Jedi.\n\n\nVerdict: 94/100 A-\n\nOverall, The Grim Fandango Remaster is a bright example of what happens when you put not just passion into a game, but a lot of thought into everything in making a statement about potential in storytelling, limits of humor, and what a simple game is capable of, now here for a whole new generation to enjoy and discover.","February 7, 2015","true","0.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Trends in gaming were changing, and players were looking for more graphics-intensive titles with the novelty of Internet multiplayer. The age of the first-person shooter had begun and adventure games were on the wane. LucasArts, the monolith of adventure game developers, decided to cancel further development of adventure games, and let go most of their dev teams in the years that followed. For a while there, it seemed like Grim Fandango would be the last great adventure game ever made. When new games pushed it off the shelves, it basically became lost to time—out of print and held by a company uninterested in reviving it.\n\nFast forward to a little over a decade later, and adventure games are thankfully back on the up and up. LucasArts veterans at Telltale Games have achieved a noteworthy level of commercial and critical success with The Walking Dead games. Video game auteur and Grim Fandango creator Tim Schafer is finally revisiting the point-and-click adventure after his 2000 split with LucasArts; the Broken Age series is being developed at his own Double Fine Productions. With this new resurgence in mainstream popularity, the adventure game genre looks like it is finally here to stay. Good news for new games—great news for old ones and the people who remember them.\n\nNow, with a new deal between the newly Disney-acquired LucasArts, Sony, and Double Fine, Grim Fandango is finally seeing the light of day again, by the hands of its original authors. While the adventure games of today have evolved in Grim’s absence, many of them are still indebted to Fandango’s artistic success. It’s about time we got the chance to revisit it. The remastered edition is a loving look back to an era when adventure games were not merely a thing, but the thing.\n\n(Read more on Deadshirt[deadshirt.net])","February 9, 2015","true","15.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

The story, world, voice acting, music, script and style are some of the best gaming has to offer, rivalling the best animated movies. The puzzles are 80% superb, best the adventure genre can do, and 20% frustrating as all hell. Nevertheless that’s an absolutely minor thing in the grand scheme of things, and the world and writing are so incredible you’ll let any trial-and-error moments slide. The Remastered edition ensures that Grim can be played today, and the cool Developer’s Commentary and Mouse Controls mean that even people like myself who have played Grim a dozen times can still enjoy it fresh again. Not much has been done with the graphics other than a bit of widescreen adding but the lovely style the game has means that it doesn’t matter, and it still looks great anyway. To put it all into one sentence: you want to experience the best storytelling in gaming, you need to play Grim Fandango. You’ll have to use a walkthrough on the Forest, but it’ll be worth it.

Nevertheless, the game developed a cult-like following, and its fans heralded it as a monument in gameplay and storytelling.\n\nThe same is all true about Grim Fandango today - it remains just as unique, humorous, and heartwarming as before. Most compelling is the game's setting, inspired by the Mexican holiday "Dia de Muertos" (Day of the Dead) and the Aztec belief of the afterlife. The art direction of the game is incredibly different from anything else I've ever played - colorful and polygonal. The characters are also lovable, relatable and funny; the voice over work is great, especially for main character Manny and sidekick Glottis. The noir-inspired adventure they embark on is lighthearted enough to keep you laughing, yet dramatic enough to keep you wondering what will happen next.\n\nOf course, this is a remaster, so everyone is wondering what they've done to improve the original. I've seen many reviews complaining about the relative lack of improvement to the game's graphics, which I must humbly disagree with. The game retains the same graphical style of the original, but the anti-aliasing and updated lighting engine make a big difference - Manny's skin finally does look sweet as mango. The live orchestrated soundtrack is also appreciated, since Grim already had one of the best soundtracks of a PC game. And while the game is still in 4:3 resolution, that's a better option than a forced stretch to widescreen (which is actually an option in the game, but I definitely don't recommend it). It still looks fine, and the ornate bars on both sides of the screen, however unnecessary, are a nice touch.\n\nUltimately, I feel most reviews misunderstand the reason Grim Fandango needed a re-release in the first place. It was not because the graphics weren't good enough. It was not because the soundtrack was outdated. It was not because it was impossible to control (although that assumption is close - tank controls? Come on!). No, it needed to be re-released because it was nigh impossible to play on any modern machine, and it deserved recognition as the great game it is. Up until now, an entire generation of gamers have been unable to experience this treat; this remaster finally rectifies this.\n\nSo, is the game worth $15? Yes, and it always has been. Grim Fandango, remastered or not, is a masterpiece - a work of art from an era in gaming oft forgot. If you haven't experienced it before, I highly recommend it; you're in for a treat.\n\nAnd don't worry - four years in the Eighth Underworld goes by fast enough.","January 27, 2015","true","8.4"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","10","20","0","0"

The story, world, voice acting, music, script and style are some of the best gaming has to offer, rivalling the best animated movies. The puzzles are 80% superb, best the adventure genre can do, and 20% frustrating as all hell. Nevertheless that’s an absolutely minor thing in the grand scheme of things, and the world and writing are so incredible you’ll let any trial-and-error moments slide. The Remastered edition ensures that Grim can be played today, and the cool Developer’s Commentary and Mouse Controls mean that even people like myself who have played Grim a dozen times can still enjoy it fresh again. Not much has been done with the graphics other than a bit of widescreen adding but the lovely style the game has means that it doesn’t matter, and it still looks great anyway. To put it all into one sentence: you want to experience the best storytelling in gaming, you need to play Grim Fandango. You’ll have to use a walkthrough on the Forest, but it’ll be worth it.

The strange, stylized, delightfully artistic journey through the Mexican land of the dead to rescue your lost love (if Manny can love with his scythe… kept next to where his heart used to be) is filled with intrigue, revolution, mystery, misery, and endless wise cracks and puns.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PROMISEDCAKE/recommended/316790/","PROMISEDCAKE","RetroGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PROMISEDCAKE/","155 products in account","The short version: Very good for nostalgic people. Still has a few bugs here and there, and the save function will catch you off guard at times. Good game overall, but the puzzles have aged. The story is worth paying attention to though.\n\nThe long version:\n\nA funny little game with a very good plot and all new mouse controls.\n\nGreat game that will be enjoyed most by people who played it in 1998.\n\nGraphics are considerably smoother, but the game still runs in 4:3 with a border. You can get it to run in 16:9 but all it does is stretch the screen. As said before, the mouse controls that were usually used in lucasarts games were not used in the original game, so they put it back in because the controls were dreadful.\n\nThe game is much more enjoyable if you go into it without knowing anything, but it's still enjoyable for people looking for a blast from the past.\n\nThere are special features now, like being able to switch from original graphics to remastered graphics (the difference being the lighting, shadows and textures. The prerendered backgrounds are untouched).\n\nSome puzzles require observational skills to solve, and talking to people and emptying their dialogue trees will sometimes help you will the trickier ones. Some of them have aged badly though.\n\nThe achievements are rather easy to recieve. Most of them are obtained when you get people to say certain things, which is a bit too easy. There are also achievements for playing the game with the old keyboard controls and settings. I've played over 2 hours and I have already gotten most of the achievements.\n\nThe save feature isn't automatic, which is a huge problem for people with bad memory. It's not an issue with me, but I did go a full hour before remembering to save, which is dangerous.\n\nI have beaten the game, so I can say that it's not the longest game you will ever play, but that all depends on how quick you are at solving puzzles. I haven't beaten too many point and click adventures in my time, so I can say that it is a decent length.\n\nOne of the biggest issues for me was the fact that there were definitely quite a few bugs that could have been ironed out. When these issues occur, you know it's your fault, but it could have been patched. For instance, during an in-game cutscene (not a rendered one), you can click on the inventory icon, which many people will do since there is at least one point in the game where it seems appropriate to do so, but it actually makes the game no longer interactive, and you can't even open the main menu. Top that off with a long time gap between your last save, and your progress is gone. So, many of these glitches happen if you open your inventory at the wrong time, or if you just do something that the game doesn't want you to.\n\nThe game has aged rather well, but obviously there will be graphical weaknesses as you expect from old games. This is a story based game too, so gameplay is really great when it comes to puzzle solving, but if you aren't one for stories, then you might not enjoy this one.\n\n\n\nNote: This is a little off topic, but the PS4 version of this game is really easy to get a platinum trophy for. It only took me 8 hours.","February 14, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While I still remember the solutions to the majority of the puzzles, I still need help from time to time. I would recommend using online help if you are too stuck to avoid the sometimes obscure puzzles detracting from the overall experience.

Retailing for $15 rather than $40-60, you get a feature-complete version of Grim Fandango with all of the following:Compatibility updates for Windows 7/8/10New mouse-driven mode, plus a form of tech-heresy called Camera-Relative Controls New lighting effects, cleaner textures, and moreAgain, the legendary game on Steam for only $15, $5-10 if you get it on sale.No stupid changes.  Tank Controls are still there, the art-style is still intact, it's still Grim Fandango.\n\nGrim Fandango's definitely still worth a buy for a fan of the adventure point-n'-click genre.  The humor and artstyle has aged very well, with a very compelling and darkly humorous storyline based on Mexican mythology.\n\nBefore you say "OH BUT THE HOUR COUNT..." no.  Offline mode doesn't log hours.\n\nNow, this remaster has a bit of controversy... okay, a LOT of controversy.  Namely, I'm talking about a few things:Backgrounds and Cutscenes.  Sadly, most of this game's original files are long gone, meaning nothing can be done about the poorly aged backgrounds and clips pulled from archaic LucasArts hard drives.  However, characters are now well-lit and further push a cartoonish aesthetic.\nCompatibility.  A lot of work was put into making this game fully support modern computers natively.  From timing issues to flat-out not launching, the original version on Windows 7 and above is a hopeless case.  However, in their tweaks, a number of issues have come up with Intel HD.  On 3000 and below, you'll need a special tweak (found in the forums) to get past the first cutscene, then hit backspace in-game for classic graphics.  For 4000, it should be mostly fine, but a number of issues (such as Manny disappearing altogether) will be encountered with the "Remastered" graphics.  Since everything's worked perfectly on a GT 620, AMD A10, and R9 280, I'll assume it's Intel HD in specific.\nPuzzles.  There are quite a few complaints about how nothing's been streamlined.  Look, I'm not even going to address this one.  I mean, come on.  You've had almost two decades to figure this one out.  It's a point-n-click type game, you could have guessed this would come up eventually.  If it bothers you that much, get a walkthrough for the parts you truly can't solve.  If you pay close attention to the story and what's going on, this won't happen often, but you'll get lost occasionally.  As for me, the world is interesting enough to keep me wandering until I find a solution.\nThe game itself is worth $20 alone, and getting the game with a Windows 7/8/10 compatibility update thrown in for free along with some tweaks and lighting effects, this is an excellent deal.  By all means, though, go ahead and wait on this one if you feel like it-- unlike the retail version, this one's up online for good.","November 3, 2015","true","12.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The only difference being that double-fine updated specific things such as graphics.\n\nTo put simply, the game is what you would expect as an point and click adventure game and the story is what makes this game so special and unique, with updated graphics and a graphics comparison (Press backspace) you can contrast between them and see the difference for yourself. There's also the option of Tank controls in which it may bring back nostalgia for some as they try and us the arrow keys and other such buttons.\n\nHowever, it isn't perfect. The game suffers badly at this moment from glitches and other exploits which you would of hoped  Double-Fine would have fixed before release and although I never encountered an save-breaking bug, I had an issue with my graphics which forced me to go and try a bunch of things to try and fix this bug. Also, I'm not one for the classics manual save game, this is one of the most simplest things and whilst it does bring back memories, it is possible to complete a whole section and then have your game crash forcing you to complete that whole section again!\n\nSo, what do i think of the game? I throughly enjoyed the game once I got into the main story but, if you are thinking of purchasing this game I'd wait for Double-Fine to update the game and fix most if not all of the bugs, you do not want my graphics issue I'll tel you that.","April 11, 2015","true","19.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Retailing for $15 rather than $40-60, you get a feature-complete version of Grim Fandango with all of the following:Compatibility updates for Windows 7/8/10New mouse-driven mode, plus a form of tech-heresy called Camera-Relative Controls New lighting effects, cleaner textures, and moreAgain, the legendary game on Steam for only $15, $5-10 if you get it on sale.No stupid changes.  Tank Controls are still there, the art-style is still intact, it's still Grim Fandango.\n\nGrim Fandango's definitely still worth a buy for a fan of the adventure point-n'-click genre.  The humor and artstyle has aged very well, with a very compelling and darkly humorous storyline based on Mexican mythology.\n\nBefore you say "OH BUT THE HOUR COUNT..." no.  Offline mode doesn't log hours.\n\nNow, this remaster has a bit of controversy... okay, a LOT of controversy.  Namely, I'm talking about a few things:Backgrounds and Cutscenes.  Sadly, most of this game's original files are long gone, meaning nothing can be done about the poorly aged backgrounds and clips pulled from archaic LucasArts hard drives.  However, characters are now well-lit and further push a cartoonish aesthetic.\nCompatibility.  A lot of work was put into making this game fully support modern computers natively.  From timing issues to flat-out not launching, the original version on Windows 7 and above is a hopeless case.  However, in their tweaks, a number of issues have come up with Intel HD.  On 3000 and below, you'll need a special tweak (found in the forums) to get past the first cutscene, then hit backspace in-game for classic graphics.  For 4000, it should be mostly fine, but a number of issues (such as Manny disappearing altogether) will be encountered with the "Remastered" graphics.  Since everything's worked perfectly on a GT 620, AMD A10, and R9 280, I'll assume it's Intel HD in specific.\nPuzzles.  There are quite a few complaints about how nothing's been streamlined.  Look, I'm not even going to address this one.  I mean, come on.  You've had almost two decades to figure this one out.  It's a point-n-click type game, you could have guessed this would come up eventually.  If it bothers you that much, get a walkthrough for the parts you truly can't solve.  If you pay close attention to the story and what's going on, this won't happen often, but you'll get lost occasionally.  As for me, the world is interesting enough to keep me wandering until I find a solution.\nThe game itself is worth $20 alone, and getting the game with a Windows 7/8/10 compatibility update thrown in for free along with some tweaks and lighting effects, this is an excellent deal.  By all means, though, go ahead and wait on this one if you feel like it-- unlike the retail version, this one's up online for good.","November 3, 2015","true","12.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Sadly, only 4:3 support)\n- while it is a good remaster, a few bugs are there.

Oregon Trail?), way before even the Atari or Commodore 64. Throughout school, university, rock bands, becoming a banker, getting married, etc etc etc I have always gamed, never stopped.\n\nThe point being I've played a lot of games, and continue to do so.\n\nGrim Fandango is in my Top 3 games of all time.  It is the pinnacle of traditional Adventure gaming that LucasArts briefly perfected so well.  It is the best Tim Shafer (sp?) game too, IMHO, and that's saying something because I love all of his games for LucasArts, in addition to Psychonauts and most of Double Fine's other releases.\n\nI have dreamed about this game, and if you ever asked me which game I wish they would remaster and make available again so I could replay it on today's hardware, I would say 'Grim Fandango' without hesitation. I have honestly missed this game, and so I am simply overjoyed to see it on Steam.  I loved it so much I refused to get any help solving any of the puzzles; it remains a source of pride that I finished Grim Fandango completely by myself without any hints, even though one puzzle in particualr kept me stumped for two weeks.  It is simply not possible to stump me in a game for that long anymore, for I will uninstall it before giving it that much of my precious time. With Grim Fandango, it was worth it.\n\nAs you can see by my hours logged, I really haven't played the new version yet. But I've seen enough to know they got it right: the art is the same, but the textures and resolution are brought up to speed. The backgrounds seem a little low-res compared to the new 3D models, but the fantastic acting, long satisfying story, and devious puzzles should cause you to forget about any of that very quickly.","January 27, 2015","true","21.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

Sure you can still use them if you prefer them but i like those kind of games played with mouse more.

I don't believe that a game should be held accountable for technical difficulties that a few people experience. For me, the game runs perfectly aside from the ocassional framerate stutter.\n-=END OF DISCLAIMER=-\n\nI've never played the original Grim Fandango (I was only 3 when it came out), so nostalgia was not a factor in the purchase of this game for me. I had heard that Grim Fandango was an exceptional (if a bit lukewarm) release in the LucasArts canon, so I felt that I would be missing a piece of gaming history if I didn't play it. (Plus, I'm a huge fan of Adventure games). The game is a run of the mill adventure game on the most basic level, but stands head and shoulders above other adventure games.\n\nTHE AESTHETICS\nDodgy mechanics notwithstanding, Grim Fandango's humor is where it really shines. It certainly has a decent pedigree. LucasArts is famous for their humor, and Tim Schafer (Grim Fandango's director) is a very funny guy, The story and art style is an intoxicating mixture of Art Deco, Film Noir, and Central American legend. It is serious enough to make the player understand the gravity of the story, but light enough to lampoon classic examples of Noir and even throw in an occasional pun or two. The dialog is rock solid and the voice acting is fantasic, both painting a rich and detailed world of comic intrigue. Every dialog tree is chock full of exposition and chuckle-worthy quips that range from farce to high-brow humor, though the game tends to lean more towards the latter. The story is what will keep you playing as you slog through the dated mechanics.\n\nTHE MECHANICS\nThe original game had a strange control scheme that forgoed the standard point and click scheme and replaced it with Resident Evil-style tank controls and key presses. The new version features a more traditional point and click scheme and controller support that makes it very accesable to new fans of the genre. In theory, at least. In practice, the new control schemes are the only mechanical difference the new version has to offer. The new version suffers from issues that all adventure games suffer from. Namely, difficult puzzles. It would seem that one must use an entirely different kind of logic to solve puzzles in Grim Fandango. As a very young child, I played educational point and click games and I am a huge fan of The Dig and other LucasArts Adventure games, so I consider myself to be somewhat capable at these kinds of games. Even so, Grim Fandango mangaged to throw me for a loop during the first puzzle. The thing this game needs most is a hint system.\n\nTHE VERDICT\nGrim Fandango Remastered is a great game (even if Remastered is a bit too generous of a word). The mechanics are slow and have not aged well, but the fun art design, sharp humor, and fantastic voice work more than make up for it. Despite what the new control schemes would suggest, the game is not as welcoming to new fans of the genre as it at first appears. For those who already own the original, this game is only a must-buy if you cant get your original copy to work, as the new lighting and textures alone aren't worth 15 bucks. However, for those who grew up playing the original, or for those who are fans of the genre and want to experience a piece of gaming history, Grim Fandango Remastered is a must have.\n\nPROS\n+Funny\n+Amazing Story\n+New Control Schemes\n+Art Style is Absolutely Stunning\n\nCONS\n-Mechanics have not aged well\n-Difficult Puzzles\n-No Hint System\n-Slight Graphical Upgrade Not Worth $15\n\nI Give It a 8.2/10","January 28, 2015","true","2.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Yet, while it has always been praised by critics as a masterpiece it was widely ignored by the general PC gaming community when released in the late 1990s. Gamers then discovered its beauty and craftsmanship years later when it was no longer in production. I was one of those gamers and quite frankly gave up on a re-release years ago. So you can imagine how delighted I was when I heard it was coming back in re-mastered form.\n\nSimply put, this game broke a lot of ground in terms of character development, 3D imaging, story, dialogue, music and voice-overs, puzzle solving, and point and click mechanics. So a lot of the common things you now see in many contemporary adventure games are a direct product of Grim Fandango's trail blazing effort in 1998. So rather than list all of the game's accolades, I suggest you purchase this game and just play it yourself.

Back when it was first released, I instantly fell in love with this quirky Film-Noir-inspired adventuregame, and I have played it several times over the years. While considered a commercial failure back then, it has since gathered a cult following on who have kept it alive.\n\nAnd I feel it deserves its high praise: Grim Fandango is, to this day, one of my favorite adventure games. Its stylistic vision remains one of the best in the medium overall, and the story and mythology is absolutely inspired. This remastering of the old classic removes the one thing I disliked about the game at launch (the tank-controlls) and gives the old textures and character-models a slight spit-shine to make them easier on the eyes on our new, fancy monitors.\n\nThe game puts you in the shoes of Manny Calavera; a travel-agent for the Department of Death. After a less-than-moral life, he is working off his sins in the land of the dead by selling premium travel-packages to newly-departed souls. Depending on how good you were in life, the 4-year journey of the soul may be considerably shorter, as you either have to walk, drive, cruise or travel by bullet-train into the land of eternal rest. But not everything is as it should be in the D.O.D. and Manny soon starts to unravel a web of corruption and fraud within the system.\n\nThe story is a fun Film-Noir-inspired romp that brilliantly mixes Mexican folklore and tradition with its own inventions to create a fascinating world and mythology. I'd hate for the game to get a direct sequel (seeing as the story is tied up neatly) but the world itself is bursting with great materials for a spin-off. The characters are great, the voice-actors have all done solid work, and the music perfectly adds to the games' atmosphere.\n\nNow lets talk about the bad for a bit; Grim Fandango looks a little dated. Its style was tailored to the limitations of 3D-technology at the time, and it looks BETTER than a vast majority of games from the era, but it's still something to consider. The 4:3 pre-rendered backgrounds hold up (even if I wish they were a little sharper) and the new textures are decent, but I would have loved a full 16:9 presentation and better character-models. There are also some bugs here and there, and no auto-save feature, so save often - just in case. The tank-controls are as aweful as ever, but you can play it in different modes - my favorite being the point-and-click interface.\n\nBeing a "simple" remaster (if that's even a thing - I'm not a game developer) I think Double Fine is to be commended on their work here. The added commentary-system is fun for fans of the game, and while it still has some technical issues, Grim Fandango is a game worth preserving. Since this was never advertised as a full-on remake, I've known for a while that this wasn't gonna be a brand new experience based on an old game; but rather an old game presented in the absolutely best way possible - warts and all.\n\nI can't speak on how easy the puzzles will be to newcomers - having done them myself so many times over the years that I go from memory - but I assume its fair to say that a few places suffer from "Adventure-game-logic" where you'll have to either pay crazy attention to every little tidbit of information you've encountered and make some logical leaps, or just consult a guide. If you've enjoyed the genre of point-and-click adventure games in the past, yet somehow managed to skip Grim Fandango, it is - as it has always has been - one of the best.","January 28, 2015","true","14.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I love point'n'click games since I was a youngster and have never really felt the need for a walk through but some of these "puzzles" are really not "puzzles" but things you will not figure out. I got to the end of year 2 before I gave up and looked up the solution only to realise I would have never figured it out otherwise. That is very bad design, there are other parts later on that suffer from the same thing.\n\nIts not really a "remaster" either the character models have been updated but thats it, everything else looks exactly like the original (which I actually liked since I never played the original) but the complaints people had 20 years ago have not been fixed (regarding bugs) and thats pretty bad and lazy if you ask me.\n\nOverall the game has a great story but in truth its far better to just watch someone do a no commentary play through of it online since the "point and click"/gameplay elements are not worth it.

The dead take on the personalities and realities inspired by the holiday it is based upon. You are Manuel Calavera, a soul bound to wander the pergatory the dead are bound to and have begun by paying off his debt to other souls.\n\nWhat this game excels in is assuming you know a thing or two. While the game is entirely secular*, the design team wastes little time dispensing knowledge on the masses. You either understand why Manny is doing what he does, or you look it up. Both are something so lost in modern media that it's refreshing to see this surface again, albeit in a remaster, as opposed to a modern game.\n\nFor the readers who are curious, but not inquisitive, the protagonists of the game are made to wander a underworld looking to right the wrongs they've accumulated in their life time here in the living world. Everyone is assigned a task based on their skills and abilities and are made to work off their sins or lack of mercies in a underworld that resembles our own realities, but is still mired in the greed and corruption that populates ours. While you would assume that all souls look to escape their miserable realities and go to a better world, there are some who are so narcisistic and sociopathic that they would still only profit themselves, even with the promise of a better reality somewhere else. Manny is trapped in this reality, slaving away on purgatory travel to pay off his former life. Enter the protagonist, GREED, as the soul (sole) reason he cannot pay his debt and leave his miserable existance. Now a four year journey takes place that asks what can a person do to escape their own reality, while correcting the wrongs they encounter in the here and now. A "film noir" environment explodes with the bravado and humanity of the movies that inspired this classic, tuxedos, cocktails, loose women, a inescable truth, and romance. This game makes the reality of our world seem mundane and inexplicable. Are we truly trapped in a cycle of work and pay, or are we playing a part in a bigger machine, designed to keep the cogs in all the right places? Does being alive truly stop us from getting the things we deserve; are we waiting for something to just come along and land in our laps as a the golden ticket to freedom?\n\nPlay the game, experience the magic. The forest and the ship are both stumbling blocks that I suggest you simply follow a guide for. They were developed with illogical puzzles solely to assauge publisher demands for play time and have no bearing on the story. something the original design lead openly admits. They don't honestly belong in the game and their elements are as rushed as they are uncharacteristic of the game as a whole.","March 21, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It looks pretty much the same, can't even say that textures are better. Also playing in 4:3 in 2015 seems silly and 16:9 basically just stretches the picture. Luckily the game aged pretty well thanks to it's special art style.\n\nBUT! That said, it is an amazing example of a classic point'n'click quest with fantastic characters, interesting world and story, great music and good voice acting. It is something. What good Remastered version brings is the ability to actually run the game on modern systems (a reason enough for me to buy it) and fixing the controlls. In the original you had very clunky controlls (that you can chose here to get an achievement), here however you have a proper mouse support which makes the game all the more enjoyable.\n\nConclusion: It is as good as it used to be 17 years ago, but with few quality of life improvments. If you're an oldfog like me, or you have an interest in point'n'click games, or you're young and want to see what we used to play in our childhood - grab it and enjoy.

Other than a point and click system, and some slightly smoother models and lighting, not much else is changed and a lot of the pre-rendered material is still in place.\n\nYou don’t even get a proper widescreen format (enabling it makes everything look all stretched) and most of the FMV are pretty pixelated still. Additionally, a lot of glaringly obvious bugs are still present in the game such as not being able to re-enter Glottis's car if you exit it in certain parts of the screen, and general freeze-ups when approaching areas/items from different camera perspectives. There were also a lot of animation glitches that made certain serious scenes look ridiculous with floating objects and misplaced limbs.\n\nAs far as the game itself goes, most of the puzzles are fair enough with a few parts that might stump those who are using the tank controls over PnC because some of the interactive elements aren't very obvious. The characters are interesting and Manny's interactions with them can be downright hilarious and the story is among one of the greatest stories for a point-and-click adventure ever.\n\nThat being said, I felt like this remaster was just a cash grab for double fine. Since original copies of this game can be hard to come by (the legitimate way can run you up to $30 or $40) you may be stuck grabbing this one, and they probably banked on that by setting the base price to around $15 just so they can rake in some easy money. I would only recommend this game on sale for around 2-3 dollars and only to people who don’t have the means of getting the original version.\n","January 3","false","12.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Call me whatever you want: I probably deserve any and all the insults.\n\nI am not a big fan of this game, and unless you played it around the time it came out, you might not like it either. It's the kind of game that you had to have been raised on slower games like this and not fast-paced action games like Halo or Super Smash Bros.\n\nThe game is entirely imaginative, creating a great and unique world both like yet unlike anything you've ever seen. It takes something as frightening as death and the underworld and turns it into an office. No matter what, you can't fault the game for the story, setting, or characters.\n\nThe problem is not the pieces of the structure, but the glue that holds all the pieces together: The puzzles and getting from point-A to point-B. I've heard that Grim Fandango is one of the better Adventure games because it isn't as convoluted as some of the other popular adventure games. Despite knowing that,\n\nI promised myself that I wouldn't read a walkthrough because I wanted to test my patience: Can I, a young adult who has played many video games but never played this before, figure out and have fun with one of the most venerable games on the PC? Long story short, no.\n\nIs it my fault? Of course it is. My mind is used to being constantly stimulated when playing video games. A game where it takes a while to get to the stimulation gets boring really quickly.\n\nThis was one of many games I tried recently because I now know about all of these great games and almost all of them ended the same: I'd get bored of them quickly and I would stop after an hour or two. I didn't like The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind because I'm so used to Skyrim holding my hand. I couldn't get pumped for Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time because I would much rather have linear goals set before me. Had I played any of these games when I was a kid, I'd probably think differently.\n\nI also know there are some games I'd defend that suffer from the same fate. The Hitman series is one of my favourite series', but probably because I played Hitman 2, Contracts, and Blood Money around the time they came out. I can go back to those games any time and still enjoy it, probably just because of nostalgic reasons. So if someone new to the series asks me, "which Hitman's the best one to play?", I always say, "Absolution", because it's the most action-packed version which gives you the most help when completing missions. But if someone asks, "which is the best game in the whole series, I'd say, "Blood Money".\n\nTL;DR, I didn't like Grim Fandango because I, and everyone my age or younger, are stupid.\n","September 13, 2015","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Still, it had some technical flaws back in the days, stuff like bugs and such. Back in the 90's there weren't DLCs, fixes and stuff like this, so those bugs remained there.\nNow we have a thing called Grim Fandango REMASTERED, so you think that the game gets refreshing stuff like compatibility, new graphics, maybe new ways to approach the game and FIXES. We have some new 3D models, but the prerendered backgrounds are still the same (and look a little worse if you use the remastered version), the movements feel iffy and can be used only with tank commands, otherwise Manny will always get confused when moving to another area. But most of all, we don't have any fix for bugs, just a compatibility fix for new systems. Why do we need a Remaster then? I'm not even using the Remastered graphics because except the "new" 3D models everything looks worse. Even the dubbing didn't get an audio improvement (italian version, don't know for the others) and you can clearly hear the microphone noises of the 90's, some Audacity fixes could've help a lot, it's not asking too much I think, some basic stuff if you call your product REMASTER. But most of all, bugs didn't get a fix, I encountered some of them (crashed a couple of times) and now I'm stuck to Rubacava because everytime I try to give an object to Glottis to proceed, he starts running in circles and I can't command anything, so I'm stuck and the only thing I can do is close the game and start from the beginning and hope it doesn't happen again (reloading the savefile doesn't work).\nIs the game worth playing? Grim Fandango is one of the most beautiful games ever made, so yes.\nIs the REMASTERED worth buying? No, because it's just the same game with not much effort and not even basic fixes.","March 28","false","35.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I am a huge adventure fan and have been for almost 30 years, but somehow i missed this one first time around. Although Grim Fandango has all the ingredients for a great story - noir setup, swingin' jazz, Chicano swagger and a fabulously imaginative mythology - the actual mechanics and story structure don't hold up any more. You know an adventure game failed when trying to solve the puzzles is so tedious you resort to following a walkthrough all the way through, and it's still tedious.\n\nThere is lots of repetitive running back and forth to collect objects that form implausible solutions to opaque puzzles rarely even hinted at in dialog. There are also some frustrating timing puzzles that are made all the more painful by a truly awful user interface (most egregious example: to switch items you have to click one by one through your whole inventory). And for some puzzles there is an elaborate setup that if you miss one tiny piece you are stuck retracing your steps for the billionth time. But, most disappointingly, as cool as the character designs are i just didn't end up caring about any of them because the dialog lacks emotional weight. Perhaps i would not have noticed these things if i had played it in 1998, but in 2016 when adventure game interfaces have become so streamlined, when their characters are so much more deeply developed, when their stories are tackling poignant themes head-on, when their puzzles are intuitive and not a chore... This is really rough. I'm sure people who liked it back in the day will get a blast of nostalgia from this remaster, but if you're a modern adventure gamer into the sort of stuff that's come out in the last 5-10 years, this is going to be more of a history lesson than a tight and compelling story.","April 23","false","8.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'd never played Grim Fandango before, and hearing so many great things about it made me super-hyped for a re-release with achievements and whatnot. In fact, its pretty much unchanged in any major graphical or mechanical sense. The game doesn't support widescreen, and the sound is just downright shoddy.\nWorse still, it is buggy as hell. I limped through the first year/chapter only to find my saves wiped.\n\nI don't have much to say about the game itself other than that it has aged pretty badly puzzle-wise. The dialogue and plot is sharp enough, but the remaster has done the game no favours at all. I feel like this was rushed through for a nostalgia trip for old fans rather than to draw in new ones. Perhaps those who played and loved the original way-back-when can look past this remaster's flaws and faults. As someone new to Grim Fandango, playing in 2016, I can't.","May 24","false","3.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In Year Four when you are  at the stage (where the coffee is) there is a ladder that leads to a platform that houses a handheld grinder. MAKE SURE YOU ARE HOLDING THE ARM of the "half sprouted" LSA agent BEFORE touching the grinder for the first time  or else you will not be able to pick it up and finish the game.\n\nWith that out of the way I can review this. As stated above, there's a pretty big bug that's frustrating if you haven't saved your game before setting it off. Also, for some reason, only half of the game appeared to be remastered, with the last half seeming to look just like the old version. So strange.\n\nHowever, this is a game that you absolutely can't miss, especially if you like adventure games. It is one of the best adventure games ever made, and while it didn't earn big dollars on release (I think because it initially was released when game ripping was a big thing) it earned a HEAP of awards and acclaim. Don't miss it, I honestly think it's Lucasarts best.\nGreat story, still up-to-date graphics, great voice acting, great everything really.

The game still has all of the charm and humor of the original version (obviously), and for the price this is so worth playing by anyone who appreciates point-and-click adventure games.\n\nThe only negative would be that unfortunately to get all of the achievements almost requires a second play-through unless you make a setting change at the very start of the game. Not that the game isn't worth playing a second time, but I'm not a fan of "forcing" multiple playthroughs. Also, the option to render in the original resolution, to simulate thegaming days of long ago, only changes the characters, not the backgrounds.  So the backgrounds are sharp but the characters are jagged. It's not quite what I would expect of playing in the "original" resolution.\n\nBut those two negatives can't diminish a whole lot of positive. There are reasons why old-timers like me have wanted this game to come out for modern machines, whether through this remastering or through compatilibity through DOSbox or something like that. This is a long breath of fresh air in a gaming world that's dominated with open-world action games and greyscaled, militaristic shooters.

I hadn't realized how memorable the characters are, how well-written and funny the dialogues and story is, as well as how jaw-dropping the level of imagination behind the game could be. The director's commentaries are great and they add a level of deepness into the game that I really enjoyed, albeit they spoiled me the answer to some puzzles now and then.\nI guess I had a bit more expectations regarding the "Remastering", but I really can't complain either. They didn't so much remade the game for a modern quality level, rather, they modified the game to look like it should have always looked like. This "remastering" is more of an adaptation to what the original vision of the game wanted to be should it had more time of development, There are also still some glitches in the animations here and there, which is unfortunate, but nonetheless, they diminish nothing to the experience.\nIn a word, an excellent work you shouldn't miss.

However most people say it was a fantastic adventure game in the golden era of point and click adventures. I was never part of that era, I've been getting into newer adventure titles within the past few years and knew very little about the older games. With that in mind, I enjoyed the hell out of Grim Fandango. Were the puzzles nonsensically hard? Yes. Are there the occasional bugs and crashes? Yes. Is it an amazing story with beautiful locals, rich deep characters, and style oozing from every pixel? You bet. The positives outweigh the negatives for me. Yes some of the puzzles seem illogical at times, but thats part of the flavor of this era of adventure game from what I've gathered, and if you work long enough you will find the answer and it will be satisfying. The controls seemed fine to me, I had no issues. Highly recommended!","March 12, 2015","true","17.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It was never the most beautiful game there was, but it made use of its ugly graphics and somehow created a charming art style, despite its 3-dimensional shortcomings.\n\nThe problem is, for all my nostalgia, the game has not aged well. Perhpas years of mainstream gaming have conditioned me to prefer COD pace in my gaming, but I found myself getting bored. When you unlock the next session, you'll have a wide-open and expansive world to explore with wonderful characters and noir-feel. It's just when you've seen everything and talked to everyone, the speech options are gone and no one does anything different. Only by triggering the next step in a puzzle will you see anything new, and good luck solving them without some hints. I was able to do year one based on memory alone (my grandmother had a copy of the official game guide) but by year two I was getting stumped. The puzzles are far more obtuse than they are clever, though a few stand out pieces remain fun.\n\nI simply cannot give this a thumbs down. My conscience won't allow it. Just understand that the branding of "Remastered" means "Nostalgia Dinosaur." Even so, Grim Fandango was flawed for its time. It's something of a clunky masterpiece.","March 13, 2015","true","10.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are plenty of positive reviews, so I won't reiterate on cool story, imaginative visuals, great music, etc - these are all true, I will focus only on technical aspects, because they irritated me the most.\n\nWorks on Linux quite well - there were some issues, but nothing really bad (you need to restart game to go fullscreen if you went windowed for some reason, I had to restart Steam after installation for game to start).\n\nWhat didn't work well was controller support - I couldn't solve several puzzles just because Manny couldn't reach some places unless I switched to mouse (as a plus - switching between DS4 controller and mouse was a breeze). I really pity console gamers - I doubt they will be able to finish this game. What is really bad are bugs in later part of game (year 3 and year 4) - I had to consult walkthrough several times just to confirm, that my solution was correct but I was stuck because of controller support. There were also plenty of bugs in game itself (as example: once, smoke texture got "stuck" in Manny's head - it sayed there even after I restarted game).\n\nOverall it's great game and positive experience but can be (very) frustrating at times because of bugs and glitches.\n\nAlso, as a side-note - if you look at great concept art - this game should've been remade, not merely remastered - it could've been (still) so much better.","March 8, 2015","true","15.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OmegaSyndrome/recommended/316790/","OmegaSyndrome","Unholy Symbiosis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OmegaSyndrome/","341 products in account","Grim Fandango Remastered, a series of words I never thought would happen. To the average person who never played older adventure games this is a stepping stone into a glorious past world of video games. During the time of its original release this genre of games was very popular and there were many many games released. That being said, for this game to stand above the others as something of merit and worthwhile really says something about the end product and the team behind it.\n\nSo I guess what you are looking for is a recommendation to purchase this or to avoid it. I also assume that you have looked into the forums and read professional reviews of this product. You will learn from those forrays that this game is a remastering of the classic game released in 1998 by LucasArts. Read that word carefully, Remastering, it is not a remake or in anyway changed in content. It has been lovingly brought into our current time by a team that didn't mess with the core of what made this game great. If you can grasp what the tagline for the game is then you will not be dissappointed.\n\nI am one of those people that firmly believes that any game can be great as long as a good solid story is being told behind the scenes. Back in 1998 this was graphically a beautiful game and had no issues bringing people otherwise inclined to ignore the genre into the fold. By todays standards the game unfortunately hasn't held up enough to give younger gamers any incentive to try it out.\nHowever in my opinion this game is one of those rare jewels of the past that not only has withstood the test of time but has been polished to a sheen without comprimising the original vision of the developers. Again this is only my opinion and although I don't have any issues with the game it doesn't mean that there aren't problems brought to light by others in the community.\n\nLet's jump right into the issues concerning other buyers of this game that might sway you one way or the other. The backgrounds, nothing was done to them except when displayed in 16:9 ratio. They are no better and no worse than when the game was released in 1998, some see this as a problem. The game is meant to be played in its native format of 4:3, to obtain the 16:9 ratio the developers of this remaster had to stretch and zoom the backgrounds. This in turn caused graphical issues which they resolved by smoothing out the images. What you are left with is a semi blurry playthrough that couldn't be avoided. Had the developer had access to the original files (long since lost) they could have possibly redone the backgrounds.\n\nThe system requirements has been under fire as well. My rig is a beast so I really don't have any issue running any game on their highest setting so for this complaint I have no satisfactory response to anyone running on say a laptop or an older desktop. In my experience with the game I had no stutter or graphical issues unless you count a few corners of the screen that have wonky lighting issues. Yes you may run into issues running on XP apparently but remember that this game was remastered so that it could finally function on modern computers. Before this release it was possible to play on newer machines but it took alternate programs and you were never guaranteed a stable play through.\n\nI have also read that people are contemplating the validity of the puzzles as far as the modern world is concerned. Somehow they think that the puzzles don't stand up to time or that the way they are delivered don't click anymore. This is a weird game, the puzzles aren't meant to make you scratch your head but make you laugh when you discover the answers. Read the description of the game again and tell me if you truly expect there to be real to life like situations and puzzles. Grim is a strange and quirky adventure with strange and quirky puzzles to solve and characters to interact with.\n\nI am sure there are other issues that people have had but I want to focus on the work that the developers put into this remaster. Let me just say that Grim Fandango has never looked better, I love the subtle touches that they did with the game while retaining the original vision of the developers. The characters pop off the screen and have more depth to them than ever. The music has been redone and remastered, adding to the atmosphere even more so than before. Finally the lighting that they implemented has added immersion that just didn't exist in the original 1998 release.\n\nIn the end you get exactly what the name of the game implies, Grim Fandango Remastered. It is not a remake and was never meant to be that. This is a journey into a world that our advanced technology has denied us from enjoying. This is a game so beloved and cared for that a simple re-release would have sufficed and I and countless others would have paid full modern prices to obtain.\nEvery person owes it to themselves to pick this game up and give it the time that it deserves. 16 years is a long time in videogames and I can honestly say that Grim Fandango Remastered will remain in my favorites permanently only surpassed by the memories of the original when I first played it all those years ago.\n\n10/10\nFantastic job Double Fine","February 3, 2015","true","7.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Having had pirated it before (you couldn't buy it in my country because of sanctions), I was more than happy to pay for the remastered version.\n\nThe remastered version is not overly remastered, don't be suprised. However, you can switch between the original and the remastered rendering at any time and see for yourself. While the general static scene is untouched, the dynamic models (manny himself and everything else that moves) have indeed become much nicer.\n\nI played this on Linux (Ubuntu) and I cannot tell if this is just Linux related, but the sound was not quite right for me. The music was ok, but when manny (or anyone) talked, the sounds were chopped. I guess it wasn't always like that, but it seemed to be at least half of the times (when you start the game, it's either always good or always bad).\n\nAlso the game has some bugs. For example sometimes the animations don't finish or are badly done, like the scythe in manny's hand is at an awkward angle or completely detached, or manny holding nothing after putting back the item in his pocket, etc. But they don't affect the game that badly. Sometimes you just need to do something else to get back to the correct state.\n\nI listened to two or three of the commentaries and they didn't seem too interesting. That would depend on your own enthusiasm regarding how much you want to know about the game.\n\nThis is a great game nonetheless. If you have never played it before, I do recommend playing it. It's funny, has a nice story and the puzzles are excellent (I particularly liked year 2, the rest is rather easy).","February 3, 2015","true","9.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You'll remember the characters for a long time after playing, even the minor ones, thanks to the superb dialog lines and voice acting. The world feels real and vivid. I've played it many times since it first came out, using ResidualVM to play the original on newer machines (but it still crashed a lot), and I was very excited to play the remaster.\n\nThe remaster has improved some things (most noticeably the character models and controls), but really this game is just a gem in its original form, and now it runs smoothly on new computers.\n\nIt does have some problems:\n\n- The new point and click interface is great, but you miss out on some fun lines since you can't "Examine" doors or "Pick Up" people. Nothing major or important to the story, and I can see why they chose this for the doors at least. I actually prefer the tank controls.\n\n- Commentary doesn't auto-play and you need to look carefully to find all the clips in a certain scene. I much preferred the method chosen in the Monkey Island remake, where each scene had only one long audio clip (and it auto-played too).\n\n- Not all the art is (or seems to be?) updated, so sometimes the backgrounds seem a bit low quality, as well as some of the cutscenes. I think the game was very good looking in the original as well, so I don't mind, but the new character models can clash with the backgrounds.\n\n- Some puzzles can be confusing and it can be unclear what to do (they made no changes to this in the remaster). I advise using the UHS guide if you're stuck, since it spoils the experience much less than a walkthrough. But I think most of the puzzles are quite well designed, and not too hard if you're familiar with some other games in the genre.\n\nThese problems are no reason not to experience this story first hand. Play on a big screen with the volume turned up, and immerse yourself in this adventure!","February 1, 2015","true","29.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Grim Fandango was the pinnacle of amazing art direction coupled with the most unique and captivating story that only someone like Tim Schafer could create.  This game, unlike most games created years ago, holds up extremely well and will no doubt attract new fans of this genre.  For $15, I can't recommend this game enough!  The length alone is well worth the money honestly, because you will find yourself just marveling at the world around you.  If there is any fault to be found, I suppose camera angles and controls can be frustrating in certain areas, but they present no problem in the entirety of the game. I'd say if I were so score this game, it'd be a 9.5/10.  Buy it and fall in love!","January 30, 2015","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You have the overall Mexican Day of the Dead/film noir cocktail world and story.

However, unless you haven't played the original version, I don't feel inclined to recommend buying this one. 1080p resolution is nowhere to be seen and the 16:9 aspect ratio makes the game look like a fat mess. Many of the characters' polygons look like spikes about to impale someone and the cutscenes still look like something from 2 decades ago. Overall, still a recommend but unless you're into developer commentary, which I personally didnt see any appeal for, then you're buying into just an updated version of Grim Fandango that can satisfy those in the 21st century to the bare minimum. I would hardly call this a remaster compared to something like OddWorld.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fubarhouse/recommended/316790/","fubarhouse","FubarHouse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fubarhouse/","189 products in account","Grim Fandango was released in 1998 as the first and last 3D LucasArts adventure game. It was a success, but the lack of marketing and the three year development time had prevented it from being as successful as it should have been. In addition to this there were many other popular titles released that year, but since its release LucasArts adventure games haven't really been as successful.\n\nGrim Fandango really is a masterpiece for its story, style/art and music and there really isn't anything like it. The story is played out from the perspective of Manuel "Manny" Calavera during the end of his not so successful career. Manny is a travel agent escorting lost souls into the next life with a variety of transports based on how good the lives of his clients were lived. When Manny keeps facing coincidences of not being able to service his clients he seeks to steal some clientel. The one client he steals from his colleague is a beautiful soul known as Meche, and his actions result in her walking to the next life over the next four years. Manny then sets out to solve his problems and find Meche to stop his guilt and pain, and he falls in love with the romance of finding her.\n\nThe game is skillfully crafted to make the user think and pay attention to all the details, to get engrossed in the hand-drawn environments. The orchestral music fits in with the dark, retro, noir style beautifully and the original developers working with a new company have paid an enormous respect to this title. The title disappeared from shelves soon after being placed upon them, and now nearly 20 years later it has been restored on modern hardware to become available for an eternity. This title should not have been made in this day, but the massive co-ordination between Double Fine, Disney and Sony have made this possible and we should all be thankful. In fact Double Fine are planning on bringing Day of the Tentacle into the present day. It's this kind of love that the world needs more of.\n\nThere's nothing out there like this game. It's dark, noir, comical, political, complex, stylish, beautiful, crafty, testy, interesting and completely unique.

Loved this game when I first got my hands on it, when it first came out. I would always ask friends if they had ever heard or seen it and none of my friends had. Only thing they would ever mention was Star Wars.\n\nThis is an amazing adventure game and sadly I have not ran across many close to this with such awesome characters, creative atmospheres and just all around unique. Any friend who I have ever had the chance of showing this game to, in the past, was always amazed by it and fell in love with it.\n\nWould be nice if they had worked out some of the bugs. When I finally got this game to work years later on my computer, there were issues with it. Of course since technology is always advancing and software changes every 4 months, there were issues and the game would freeze in a few spots. One being on the conveyor belt when you get to the edge of the world. I have not played it in a few years so I couldnt remember if you could pull stuff out from your inventory near the end of the conveyor belt in order to mess with the anchor, but it froze in this remastered version as it did a few years back.  Then the other time is when you are trying to free Meche out from the safe. Again I opened my inventory to pull out the bust-all to see if I could use it on a spot on the wall where the coral wall is on the inside of the safe, and it froze again. Touching escape or any buttons on the keyboard or mouse did nothing. I even hopped out of the game and tried reopening the window without exiting the game and again nothing. Once it is stuck it is stuck and ctrl+alt+delete is the only way to get out and re-open the game.\n\nBest advice, save every second you get because if it freezes and you have made A LOT of progress, it hurts to have to do it all over again.\n\nBest of luck and hope you enjoy this game as much as I do ^_^ its well worth every penny for me because nostalgia is a beautiful thing.\n\nReally really hope the company does a remaster of Full Throttle as well. That one didn't have as great of graphics as Grim Fandango, but it was another awesome adventure game of Lucas Arts, and I really hope that someone remasters it soon, and doesnt screw it up with some reboot that turns out like crap.","February 4, 2015","true","12.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They also added a dev commentary track and point-and-click controls, which is a great improvement. The background textures are just fine for me, since they were excelent to begin with, but what bothers me is that the cut-scenes are the exact same, and that the game has a bug (which has happend to me several times), in which after I pull out an item in an area where it's not needed, the game unables me from walking, interecting and even going to the menu--leaving me with no choice but to close the window and lose my unsaved progress.\nEven though I have no trouble with the unchanged features, this just feels like a money-grab, what with the need of a patch for the technical issues. Don't get me wrong though, I do recommend buying this for the sake of being able to play Grim Fandango on a modern platform. After all, any improvements are just icing on the cake for me.\n4/10, because of bugs.\n\nThe Game:\nYou play the roll of Manuel Calavera, a travel agent in the eighth underworld in this adventure, film-noir classic. You sell tickets to the ninth underworld to people who has recently come to the eighth underworld, in order to repay a debt. But as you progress in the story, you uncover a web of corruption in the system. The game is split up in four chaptres--each one representing a year--which consists of fun puzzle solving, great story advancements and memorable characters. If you haven't played this game yet, it's a must. Grim Fandango is, and always will be the best adventure game for me.\n10/10\n\nOverall: 7/10","January 31, 2015","true","11.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You'll remember the characters for a long time after playing, even the minor ones, thanks to the superb dialog lines and voice acting. The world feels real and vivid. I've played it many times since it first came out, using ResidualVM to play the original on newer machines (but it still crashed a lot), and I was very excited to play the remaster.\n\nThe remaster has improved some things (most noticeably the character models and controls), but really this game is just a gem in its original form, and now it runs smoothly on new computers.\n\nIt does have some problems:\n\n- The new point and click interface is great, but you miss out on some fun lines since you can't "Examine" doors or "Pick Up" people. Nothing major or important to the story, and I can see why they chose this for the doors at least. I actually prefer the tank controls.\n\n- Commentary doesn't auto-play and you need to look carefully to find all the clips in a certain scene. I much preferred the method chosen in the Monkey Island remake, where each scene had only one long audio clip (and it auto-played too).\n\n- Not all the art is (or seems to be?) updated, so sometimes the backgrounds seem a bit low quality, as well as some of the cutscenes. I think the game was very good looking in the original as well, so I don't mind, but the new character models can clash with the backgrounds.\n\n- Some puzzles can be confusing and it can be unclear what to do (they made no changes to this in the remaster). I advise using the UHS guide if you're stuck, since it spoils the experience much less than a walkthrough. But I think most of the puzzles are quite well designed, and not too hard if you're familiar with some other games in the genre.\n\nThese problems are no reason not to experience this story first hand.

In Year Four when you are  at the stage (where the coffee is) there is a ladder that leads to a platform that houses a handheld grinder. MAKE SURE YOU ARE HOLDING THE ARM of the "half sprouted" LSA agent BEFORE touching the grinder for the first time  or else you will not be able to pick it up and finish the game.\n\nWith that out of the way I can review this. As stated above, there's a pretty big bug that's frustrating if you haven't saved your game before setting it off. Also, for some reason, only half of the game appeared to be remastered, with the last half seeming to look just like the old version. So strange.\n\nHowever, this is a game that you absolutely can't miss, especially if you like adventure games. It is one of the best adventure games ever made, and while it didn't earn big dollars on release (I think because it initially was released when game ripping was a big thing) it earned a HEAP of awards and acclaim. Don't miss it, I honestly think it's Lucasarts best.\nGreat story, still up-to-date graphics, great voice acting, great everything really. It's SUCH a unique game.","April 17, 2015","true","8.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Here's why:\n\n- There are many bugs in it that that aren't in the original.  Tons of clipping problems.  Characters looking in the wrong direction (Chipito when he exits the pool).  Static models/sprites where there should be animations (approaching Bowsley's shop, the bone powderizer isn't animated).  Animations that don't play correctly.\n\n- The failure to re-render the backgrounds is really unfortunate, though maybe unavoidable if the original digital assets no longer exist.\n\n- Why was the music re-recorded?  Synthesized or not, the original soundtrack was perfect.  The re-recorded versions are nice enough, but I miss and prefer the originals.  A remaster shouldn't make me miss the things I love in the original.\n\n- Why was the credits music changed?  Who on earth made that decision? The original credits music is perfect -- lively, celebratory, exciting, precisely as it should be.  The new credits music isn't any of those things.  It breaks the mood terribly.\n\nOther minor complaints include the textures here and there that aren't much better than the originals, or, in some cases, that may actually look worse than the originals (I'm thinking of the Lumbago ship-in-a-bottle when viewed in Manny's inventory and the texture on the bust-all, which looks awful).  And the pop-in animation used when the trail of sproutella meets bone dust looks cheap, worse certainly then the original.\n\nOn the whole this is, again, fine work.  I just wish DF had spent a bit more time getting some of the details right.","March 28, 2015","true","15.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game still has all of the charm and humor of the original version (obviously), and for the price this is so worth playing by anyone who appreciates point-and-click adventure games.\n\nThe only negative would be that unfortunately to get all of the achievements almost requires a second play-through unless you make a setting change at the very start of the game. Not that the game isn't worth playing a second time, but I'm not a fan of "forcing" multiple playthroughs. Also, the option to render in the original resolution, to simulate thegaming days of long ago, only changes the characters, not the backgrounds.  So the backgrounds are sharp but the characters are jagged. It's not quite what I would expect of playing in the "original" resolution.\n\nBut those two negatives can't diminish a whole lot of positive. There are reasons why old-timers like me have wanted this game to come out for modern machines, whether through this remastering or through compatilibity through DOSbox or something like that. This is a long breath of fresh air in a gaming world that's dominated with open-world action games and greyscaled, militaristic shooters. Not that those are bad genres, but every now and then it's nice to come back to a game that is colorful, funny, and very original.

I hadn't realized how memorable the characters are, how well-written and funny the dialogues and story is, as well as how jaw-dropping the level of imagination behind the game could be. The director's commentaries are great and they add a level of deepness into the game that I really enjoyed, albeit they spoiled me the answer to some puzzles now and then.\nI guess I had a bit more expectations regarding the "Remastering", but I really can't complain either. They didn't so much remade the game for a modern quality level, rather, they modified the game to look like it should have always looked like. This "remastering" is more of an adaptation to what the original vision of the game wanted to be should it had more time of development, There are also still some glitches in the animations here and there, which is unfortunate, but nonetheless, they diminish nothing to the experience.\nIn a word, an excellent work you shouldn't miss.

However most people say it was a fantastic adventure game in the golden era of point and click adventures. I was never part of that era, I've been getting into newer adventure titles within the past few years and knew very little about the older games. With that in mind, I enjoyed the hell out of Grim Fandango. Were the puzzles nonsensically hard? Yes. Are there the occasional bugs and crashes? Yes. Is it an amazing story with beautiful locals, rich deep characters, and style oozing from every pixel? You bet. The positives outweigh the negatives for me. Yes some of the puzzles seem illogical at times, but thats part of the flavor of this era of adventure game from what I've gathered, and if you work long enough you will find the answer and it will be satisfying.

One of the most fully realised worlds, replete with Mexican folklore and an endearing cast of characters, its enduring legacy remains one of cultural influence. Schafer's writing masterfully runs the gamut of nostalgic film noir, black comedy and even references to the old Beat movement. This remastered version's fruits are arguably a few aesthetic tweaks - but why fix something that isn't broke? For those interested in the genre's history before it was revitalised by The Walking Dead franchise, Grim Fandango is an essential retread of time.","May 8, 2015","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You'll remember the characters for a long time after playing, even the minor ones, thanks to the superb dialog lines and voice acting. The world feels real and vivid. I've played it many times since it first came out, using ResidualVM to play the original on newer machines (but it still crashed a lot), and I was very excited to play the remaster.\n\nThe remaster has improved some things (most noticeably the character models and controls), but really this game is just a gem in its original form, and now it runs smoothly on new computers.\n\nIt does have some problems:\n\n- The new point and click interface is great, but you miss out on some fun lines since you can't "Examine" doors or "Pick Up" people. Nothing major or important to the story, and I can see why they chose this for the doors at least. I actually prefer the tank controls.\n\n- Commentary doesn't auto-play and you need to look carefully to find all the clips in a certain scene. I much preferred the method chosen in the Monkey Island remake, where each scene had only one long audio clip (and it auto-played too).\n\n- Not all the art is (or seems to be?) updated, so sometimes the backgrounds seem a bit low quality, as well as some of the cutscenes. I think the game was very good looking in the original as well, so I don't mind, but the new character models can clash with the backgrounds.\n\n- Some puzzles can be confusing and it can be unclear what to do (they made no changes to this in the remaster). I advise using the UHS guide if you're stuck, since it spoils the experience much less than a walkthrough. But I think most of the puzzles are quite well designed, and not too hard if you're familiar with some other games in the genre.\n\nThese problems are no reason not to experience this story first hand. Play on a big screen with the volume turned up, and immerse yourself in this adventure!","February 1, 2015","true","29.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is put together really well, the PC port is exemplary great, knowing [GF] comes from PlayStation one (fun fact-default native resolution on PSOne 320*240).\nI really enjoyed the story and the crafting of the characters (Gladus was the reason I pushed through with the game) they are really really funny and quite distinct I might add.\nNow to the puzzles - some of them were so-Soo-SOOO convoluted that one needs a walkthrough doc just to get through it in a timely manner. There were some spots that I was trying to solve it my own way: but then - "nope you've gotta do it the way designers wanted". And suddenly gameplay boilds down to trying everything with everything: "you on you and also with you" - that was the part I really hate in adventure games. Hence the not recommended.

I bought it again in this sale now for £2, which is more in standing with what this "remaster" is worth.\n\nI would not recommend this product, ... This guy needs to learn from Capcom how to do a remaster that looks effective (or better yet, look at ODDWORLD NEW AND TASTY!!), and not just count on the name of a product to sell for nostalgia sake. The time should have been taken to REMAKE this game like the Monkey Island 1 and 2 remakes. From the point of view of a consumer, i just see this Grim version as lazy, and nothing new over the origional 2 disc set save for a higher resolution Manny, which im pretty sure, one could have modded for the game oneself if the inclination was there.

This game was painful. Despite having good music, talented voice acting, and an interesting story, the gameplay itself is awful. Making progress in the game is largely contingent upon either finding some stupid, piddling little thing that you could spend hours trying to figure out with no success because you'd never even realize there was something there to click in the first place, or doing a series of actions that is just so random and idiotic that it would never occur to you. It wasn't the worst game I ever played but I can firmly say I don't recommend purchasing it unless you've got a nice thick pair of rose colored glasses to throw on first.","January 3","false","10.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I got stuck very early on and had to look through a walkthrough. After doing so, I don't know how anyone could figure out how to solve these puzzles, either because they wouldn't have made intuitive sense or because I never could have known it was possible to interact with the objects I was required to use.\n\nI never played the original so I don't know what parts of this game have been "remastered" but an on-screen inventory would have made a huge amount of difference. I thought those were standard in point-and-clicks. But here I have to open this dude's jacket, manually scroll through the inventory one by one until I find the item I want, equip it, then click on the item I want to use it with, then click the menu option for the two objects to interact. What, that didn't work? Ok let's settle in for another half hour of this. What, the object I was supposed to use with it wasn't even clickable?\n\nThe story and characters are wonderful and I almost want to finish the game just so I can see it all play out, but realistically it would just me looking back and forth between the screen and a walkthrough from start to finish.

You can't figure it out because it does not make sense.\nBut then why read a walkthrough, if your going to do that than why not just watch some other guy playing the game on youtube?\nand if your doing that then why buy it?\nSo don't buy it.\n\nNot recommended.","January 5","false","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When I first bought the game I was pretty anxious to see how they have remastered the game but after 15 min of playing it I believe it is worth spending your money on it. It has the classic story, nothing added, with graphics improved for the current PC requirements which will make you fall in love with it.\n\nI do not know if this game is child-friendly but I suppose that if my mother let me play it when I was a kid of 9 it is probably safe for the current generation. 10/10","February 4, 2015","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Once upon a time I tried to run this game in an emulator and had to run a background prgram that overloaded my cpu enough to slow it down to run Grim Fandango, so to see this game on steam, for an affordable price is awesome. some say DoubleFine is doing this to make a quick buck rather than make new games and theyre just cashing in on past glories.

Igre o kojima smo pisali u nekoliko navrata, poput Broken Sworda, Monkey Islanda ili Gabriel Knighta, vratile su nas u prošlost i pokazale nam što je posebno u avanturama devedesetih. Ipak, jedan dragulj tog vremena ostao je tiha patnja jer je za njegovo pokretanje na modernim računalima bilo potrebno podosta gnjavaže.\n\nGovorimo o Grim Fandangu koji zbog uvrnute priče i luckastih likova mnogi smatraju ponajboljom avanturom svih vremena. Ne čudi zato uzbuđenje koje je izazvala Sonyjeva prošlogodišnja E3 presica, na kojoj je potvrđeno da će igra u obnovljenom izdanju i s opširnim razvojnim dnevnikom stići na moderne platforme. Obnovljena je verzija stigla krajem siječnja, a mi smo se bez previše razmišljanja odlučili zaputiti u Zemlju umrlih (Land of the Dead) kako bismo se prisjetili veselja koje nam je original pružio 1998. godine.\n\nOnima koji za Grima ranije nisu čuli, ako takvi postoje, reći ćemo – sram vas može biti – i spomenuti tek da donosi kompleksnu fabulu ispunjenu karikaturama specifičnim za Lucas Arts. Igra nas postavlja u ulogu Manuela Calavere, zatočenog u zagrobnom životu, koji pokušava spasiti pridošlicu čiste duše, Mercedes “Meche” Colomar, od vječne truleži u svijetu iz kojeg povratka gotovo da i nema. Pričati više bio bi grijeh, jer djelo poput ovog zaslužuje da mu pristupite čista uma, bez očekivanja ili saznanja o onome što donosi.\n\nVeć nakon pokretanja Grim Fandango Remastereda bilo je jasno da se u posljednjih 17 godina nije promijenilo mnogo. Igra je u svojoj obnovljenoj verziji gotovo identična originalu – veće promjene u međuscenama i nanovo crtane lokacije izostale su, a na plastičnoj su operaciji bili tek likovi čija su tijela nešto uglađenija i detaljnija nego ranije. Iako bismo nekom drugom naslovu ovo zamjerali, ovdje nam je u neku ruku simpatično, pa smo se nakon svega nekoliko sati prebacili na opcionalne originalne rendere koji još uvijek izgledaju solidno i iz neobjašnjivih nam razloga više odgovaraju.\n\nKao point-and-click avantura, Grim Fandango zahtijeva mnogo istraživanja, a zahvaljujući obnovljenim kontrolama, ono je poprilično lako i intuitivno, no ako poželite igrati s gamepadom, pripremite se na nešto teže snalaženje u prostoru i povremeno aktiviranje radnji koje niste željeli. Rješavanje zagonetki zahtijeva nešto mozganja, a obnovljena verzija igre, za razliku od mnogih drugih, ne nudi sustav pomoći, pa bi manje vješti avanturisti mogli imati problema s opširnim rješenjima koja stoje na granici nelogičnosti, kako Lucas Artsovoj igri i priliči.\n\nPošalice i dijalozi svježi su i danas – vrijeme očito ne može narušiti njihov kul faktor – a u kombinaciji s obnovljenim zvukom i glazbenom podlogom, čine kvalitetan naslov vrijedan svake kune. Bilo da ste nakon 17 godina poželjeli obnoviti iskustvo ili se s igrom susrećete prvi put, radi se o naslovu koji će vas zabaviti i postati dio vaše liste omiljenih.\n\nPlus; Obnovljene kontrole, dijalozi i pošalice svježi su i nakon mnogo vremena\nMinus; Nespretne kontrole gamepadom\nDojam; Kvalitetno reizdanje jedne od ponajboljih avantura još je jedan pokazatelj kvalitete starih Lucas Artsovih avantura.\n\nOCJENA: 88%\n\nRecenzija je objavljena u 268. broju Buga\nhttp://www.bug.hr/bug/ozujak-2015/94404.aspx","April 10, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

I recommend playing it because the game itself is a masterwork. BUT maybe pick it up when it's cheap. Or borrow a copy of the original from a buddy and use ResidualVM to play it on a modern machine -- the "remastered" elements are not worth the price.\n\nAs far as the game itself goes: hilarious dialogue, devious puzzles, gorgeous set design, amazing music, and an epic story. Some of the puzzles show their age in that they don't make a lot of sense in a modern gaming frame-of-mind. Don't be ashamed to look up hints when you need them (UHS has a great set of hints that don't spoil the puzzles). I was surprised at how much I'd forgotten since first playing the game when it came out.\n\nThe remastered implementation is not good. The commentary is badly implemented and is not all that substantive. The best part of the remaster is the smoothed-out resolution of all of the 3D models and textures. Unfortunately there was not much that could be done to improve the pre-rendered sets, so they clash with the models. Though they do have a nostalgic charm. The controls are still frustrating, even with the the ability to change them, and several crucial bugs have been added (or maybe not fixed). Save early and often in different slots just in case you run into a game breaker -- I ran into a few myself and the forums are full of 'em. Also the re-orchestrated music is puzzling because some of the tunes don't seem to benefit at all from it.\n\nAlso the achievements are bugged. Played through the whole thing with tank controls on the keyboard and didn't get the achivement!\n\nIf you've never played the game before you can wait until it goes on sale. If you're rabid to experience it again, go ahead and pick it up now, it's a nostalgic trip.\n\n","February 2, 2015","true","19.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

I completed it again last night and I didn't regret it. Infact I was sad when it ended because I realised that I had just finished one of the last great adventure games. Every facet of this game shines with originality and charm. It is a noir tale of betrayl, conspiracy and redemption in the land of the dead. The remaster, although buggy in some respects, makes this classic shine brighter than ever.\nIt is a long game but when the credits finish rolling you will be waiting for more... but there will be no more. Not now, not ever again. There will not be a Monkey Islands sequel, there will be no Sam & Max sequel and there will certainly be no Grim Fandango sequel. These types of games are dead and now we are left with pale immitations, unoriginal copys of other games unable to stand on their own two feet.\nThis is a fantastic game and I encourage you to play it but be aware of the crushing feeling you experience in the pit of your gut once its over because its important.

The puzzles are difficult but far from being clever. To solve one, you need to try everything with what you got in your inventory and things you can interact, but the map is really big. Thus going to one place from another takes so much time and it gets really annoying after some point. You may spend 3 hours on a little puzzle which takes less than 2 minutes, but you may not find the solution.

So let me first say: The game as such is amazing and its reputation as one of the best adventures ever made is well deserved. There are one or two annoying riddles, but overall not many games come close.\n\nWhat IS annoying is the lackluster way this "Remastering" was done: Take the game from 1998, make sure the engine runs on more and more modern platforms and ship it. Improvements to graphics: Negligible. Some rough textures replaced with slightly(!) more detailed ones. The models themselves still seem to be composed of, at most, double-digit polygon numbers.  The original Grim Fandango is based on static 2D backgrounds. Nothing wrong with that, however, they have not been redone. So you basically have the 1998 backgrounds scaled up to FullHD, with no additional details. Yes, they aged well, but you see heavy dithering and a lack of detail. Speaking of dithering: Cutscenes have not been done. Remember the times when you squeezed a movie on a CD using DivX 3? Well, now you can have it again.\n\nThere are only two substantial things that have improved:\n1. Now the game can be largely played with the mouse (although I guess they could have leveraged a lot of work from the open-source ResidualVM for Grim Fandango, which already supported this).\n2. The remastered soundtrack is amazing\n\nI hope this does not end up in George Lucas way, where we get a new remastered deluxe edition every year. First more polygons, the year after 65k color backgrounds, finally FullHD backgrounds....\n\nSo to sum it up: Amazing game. if you do not have it, buy it once it is on discount. It will save you the hassle of installing Win98 in a Virtual machine or something and you get an amazing soundtrack. However, for the effort DoubleFine put into this, they deserve the finger!","May 24, 2015","false","9.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

So after hours of searching the internet for the problem and resolution I have to resort to a hack.  Why?  From everything I've read it's because the developer didn't take into account that Laptops in particular can have TWO different freaking video cards. The results of which causes the game to ONLY recognize the integrated video card.\nSo. I finally found, in the Steam forums for this game of all places, a hack.  A developer condoned hack discovered and posted by a genius user which allows me to play the ORIGINAL VERSION of the game as that is a FEATURE of this remaster. The ability to turn the remastered features on and off. So for me no remake with the better graphics and other supposed fancy dancy things.  The OFFICIAL reponse to users from the developer with graphics card issues regarding the game. UPGRADE.  Really... That's all the help we get.   So Yes I can play the game.

The 2nd problem is some scenes were incredibly annoying to work with, where it was hard to walk in the right place.  In the 1st floor of The Department of Death, there are two different routes on the opposite sides that lead you to the same room, which was really confusing.\n\nSTORY:\nI heard a lot of great things about this story.  To me, the concept and lore of the game was very refreshing and original.  I liked the setting and the overall theme.  But the story as a whole was really bland.  You could summarize the entire plot in maybe 2 paragraphs.  I also felt the maturity of the game was really inconsistent.  Some characters talked like it was a kid's TV show (especially Glottis...), but I wouldn't consider it a kid-friendly game either considering it involves gambling, swearing, and "killing".\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThis is where I felt the game was lacking the most.  First of all, you can't lose.  Even when there are dangerous things, you can't even try to fail when facing them.  So you might argue "but that's because this is more of a puzzle game".  Yeah, well it's not a very good one at that.  I had to look up walkthroughs for roughly half the game because most of the puzzles involved something something that I would have no reason to know (sometimes, the puzzles involved reactions that would never work in real life to any degree).  Sure, I could've figured out all of them on my own eventually, but I don't feel like wandering the area interacting with everything in sight with some random object in my hand in the hopes that something will happen.  For a few puzzles, I actually followed the walkthrough and I was still stuck, either because of glitches or something timing related that I, again, had no reason to know about.\n\n\nOverall, the game was a chore.  Maybe it'd be fine if I were still 12 years old and bored on a summer day, but as an adult this felt really mediocre and tedious.","January 28","false","12.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lakewaterontap/recommended/316790/","lakewaterontap","lake.kubilius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lakewaterontap/","396 products in account","First: I am only giving this game a "do not recommend" because I know in advance this will mark it as a minority opinion.  Lots of people LOVE this game.  In it's time, it was massively popular.  If you are one of those people, of course you will love it.  Why are you even reading reviews?  Hell, you should probably buy it just because it is considered such a classic.  But really, I feel compelled to discuss the flaws.\n\nIf you're new to the game, like I was, it... is not the same era as it was back when it was released.  Full disclosure: I was always a Sierra kid.  LA games always struck me as to frivilous and cartoony.  That's somewhat true here, but that's also this game's charm.  It has a clear style and it OWNS that clear style.\n\nThe problem is the puzzle structure.  I'm not sure I've ever felt so slack-jawed.  The game is walkthrough bait like I have never seen.  You spend the vast majority of the game with only the vaguest sense of your objectives, and the puzzles in front of you rarely seem to have any actual connection to those objectives.  If you make a solid effort to figure stuff out on your own (which I did) this actually manages to make things WORSE.  When you finally give up and look up a walkthrough for a given area, you're often unable to even figure out how to get the conditions described in the walkthrough to line up with the conditions in your game.  Events feel just. that. convoluted.   There's a puzzle in year two that I still don't even know how I was SUPPOSED to solve.  When I read what I was supposed to do to move forward, I declined.  I at least wanted to figure out how I was ever supposed to think of such a thing.  So I revisited everything that seemed related, tried to figure out what the thought process could possibly be and came up EMPTY.\n\nIn general, only after you complete a puzzle do the steps you had to take along the way begin to make sense.  That might become comically charming on a second playthrough, but on a first, it borders on maddening.  Additionally, some of the difficulty comes from the controls.  Apparently, the original version of the game used a massively different interface which sounds, frankly, awful.  But the (thankfully) new interface that has been grafted onto the game in this version makes even FINDING many key areas almost impossible.  On more than one occasion, I've been rapidly Alt-Tabbing between the game and a walkthrough, trying to figure out why I am being told to go to an area that simply does not appear to exist.  It's like trying to open a wall with an invisible door in it.  You just have to take on faith that if you reach out in this exact place and turn your wrist, a door will open.  This is not charming.  But switching over to those other controls sounds even worse.","May 10, 2015","false","36.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I’m afraid that only fans of the genre and this game will want the nostalgic injection. I think this game would have benefited from a complete overhaul rather than a simple revision.\n\nFull Review: http://www.geeksundergrace.com/gaming/review-grim-fandango-remastered-pc/","October 18, 2015","false","10.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","4","0","0"

My only desire to play it came from seeing it on many 'Top 100' lists and that I'm a fan of Double-Fine's other games. So, in other words, I played it for the story. Overall, the story isn't bad; a nice, complete narrative with the touch of dark humor that made Psychonauts so enjoyable. I may have enjoyed it more if the game itself wasn't such a buggy mess.  NPC animations often glitch while in dialog.  Some of the dialog cuts outs before a cutscene ends. Twice I came across game-breaking bugs in which using a correct item on an NPC while not standing in the correct static background (happens when the NPC can be interracted with in 2 separate static backgrounds) causes the NPC get stuck in place, being unable to initiate the correct animation.  I played the game in conjuction with a walkthrough to avoid the puzzles, so I can't speak for their difficulty. I also can't complain about the graphics. The remaster looks to have cleared alot of pixelated textures, but the game still looks old. The game IS old, so I can't fault it for this.\n\nOverall, I would only recommend Grim Fandango for the Double-Fine completionist. All others can safely stay away.","November 21, 2015","false","8.8"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

At the time my favorite game was Star Wars Dark forces 2. It looked amazing to me. To make a long story short one day, I was in the shopping center with my parents, I saw the Star Wars game, that I haven't previously seen in its' package. On the shelf net to it was leying a game that looked dusty. At first I thought it was a LEGO game, but no. It was Grim Fandango.  I so wanted to play it back then, but my parents didn't buy it for me. Fast forward ~ 16 years to E3 2014, I was so happy to see the Remastered announced.\n\nI've seen some people say that the game's graphics look ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and dated, I disagree since this is a Remastered and not a Remake.

It really is a *great* game, possibly the best point and click game I've ever played. That said, the puzzles are also of the 90's era variety - They're tough there's no handholding whatsoever. Solving a puzzle in this game is so satisfactory, there's nothing really like it on the market today.\n\nWhat really sells this game for me though is the humor, the setting, the voice acting and the general atmosphere. The dialogue is masterfully written and the voice acting is better than 95% of what you'll find in modern games. The music adds so much to the noir feel of the game - there were honestly areas where I just felt like kicking back and watching Manny light up a smoke while listening to the soundtrack.\n\nAll in all, you don't need the nostalgia trip for this to be a great game experience. It already was, is and continues to be a fantastic game.","February 18, 2015","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've finished it twice in the 4 days since I purchased the game and I can definitely say I recieved my money's worth.\n\nYou play as Manny Calavera, a travel agent for in the land of the dead. In your adventure you must save the woman you love, foil a mob boss' plans and lead a resistance against the corruption in the D.O.D. It will take you around 12 hours (dependant on how long it takes you to figure out puzzles) and it has some of the most clever and funny writing I've seen in a game. This was Tim Shaffer's last project at LucasArts and It is still one of his best.\n\nAlthough the title says "Remastered" you're not getting a huge face-lift akin to "The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition" or "DuckTales Remastered". It's really just a few fixes to some lack-luster textures to make them look more appealing. If you want to play the game with the original graphics you can change between versions with the simple click of a button.\n\nAll in all, It is definitely worth your time and money if you're a fan of funny writing, difficult puzzles and adventure games.

Grim Fandango has always been by my heart as one of my most beloved LucasArts adventure games of all time! Along with Tales from Monkey Island and Full Throttle! This has to be my third time playing Grim Fandango, and this time as a full remastered edition! First time was back in 2002 when I still had my Windows 95 PC, this was my first ever adventure game that I played along with my stupid educational games. Second time was when I rediscovered my original Grim Fandango CD-ROM game in 2010 and now again in 2015 for the remastered edition!\n\nGrim Fandango's story is brilliant. From its quirky characters to its lovable cutscenes and funny comedy. The characters such as Manuel Calavera and Glottis will surely make you fall in love with them! The music (especially in the remastered edition) is absolutely brilliant and resembles very much Spanish and Mexican music! The cutscenes are lovable and fun to watch, overall the game is brilliant!\n\nThe puzzles and game progression, although when I was young and I played Grim Fandango for the very first time I did not have any walkthroughs or guides, hell I didn't even have internet back in 2002, so the puzzles were a bit challenging and can be a bit too awkward for modern-day players or even newcomers to the genre. The game does not help you at all when progressing through and does not hold your hand when your stuck on a puzzle for too long, so be prepared to get stuck here and there, thankfully I remembered most of the stuff! Lucky guys with internet nowadays, you can simply type in walkthroughs for the game!\n\nThe remastered version, Double Fine have really done a job well done for remastering this classic. The music is spot-on and digitally remastered. The cutscenes, although not fully converted to HD are very watchable, and the new HUD system they implemented has made it easier for players to play the game (honestly, the game's original controls were clunky and very awkward, surprisingly you can still play with the old controls!). The addition of HD graphics and shadow textures, etc... made the game more stunning than it originally was (and if you want some nostalgia, you can play the game in its original graphics!)\n\nThe thing that put me off slightly was the aspect ratio, this game is not tailored for 16:9 monitors and it seems that Double Fine did not optimize the game for 16:9 monitors but kept it at 4:3 aspect ratio, you can still change the aspect ratio from its original 4:3 to 16:9, but you might have to play the game stretched out.\n\nOverall, Grim Fandango and its remastered version are simply brilliant and if you are a fan of LucasArts (like me!) or you like adventure games or you want to try something new, then I would highly recommend playing Grim Fandango and I hope that Double Fine will continue to remaster these old LucasArts classics!\n\n- Guess they couldn't save me, eh?\n- No, but there's still a chance you could save me...\n\nRECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get "Best Game of 2014" or "Best Indie Game", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)","June 23, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having reached the last chapter I can say that the remastered version doesn't leave much to desire, as far as I can tell. Other reviewers noticed bugs similar to the old version of the game. I didn't notice these and in comparison to the old version the remastered one runs smoothly and without any issues on my system. I can't exclude the possibility of bugs for everyone out there of course. Another criticism in the reviews has been that the remastering hardly added anything new. Well, I guess this had to be expected and as far as I am concerned I welcome it in this case. I never thought the game itself had to be improved much, graphicwise or soundwise, as it is pretty much timeless. Compare it to watching a Silent movie maybe. They can be improved by removing artifacts or restoring parts in which the filmmaterial was decomposed by chemical processes over time. However a good restoration of a Silent movie won't add colour or sound to the movie. This is the Grim Fandango rendering to preserve one of the best Lucas Arts Adventures of all time for present times and (hopefully) for the future. Personally I love being able to revisit all the great settings and characters, the voice-acting is still impeccable and I think there are only a handful of games that are on a similar level even today. Grim Fandango remains an awesome game-experience to play through and I just can't recommend it enough.","October 27, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also there are a lot of "filler" areas you are always travelling through but basically nothing happens there. For me, the game took around 10 hours to finish, but if I were stuck, I was using external hints to figure out the way to go; almost half of this time was during moving through the different areas.\n\nIn general, if you like point-'n-click adventures, this game is very nice, but can be extremely hard if you don't figure out the one solution the puzzles require.  The story and the music is fun; but much harder than usual adventure games; and one of the first three dimensional ones, so expect the controls to be clunky.","November 15, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not only do they add nothing to the game and are clearly tacked on, in some cases they substantially DETRACT from the experience.\n\nFor instance, there is a moment in the game where the camera zooms out and a lot of time passes. This is a huge surprise! Most adventure games take place within short time periods, and that Grim Fandango takes a different route gives it a certain gravitas, a certain epicness --- befitting the death theme.\n\nBefore the game has a chance to deliver this big reveal on its own terms, the lamest achievement imaginable ruins it for you on the bottom right of the screen, because its very name is a giant spoiler.\n\nI know a lot of people want "achievements" in their games and I don't want to criticize that in general (The Stanley Parable already has).

The devs even left some of the bugs in for nostalgia reasons it seems.\n\nThe best thing about the remastering is that it works on all OS, meaning I can finally play it again after all these years and enjoy it just as I did way back then. If you've never played this masterpiece, you are in for a treat.","November 2, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is great, a lot of references from mexican culture wich I always appreciate when they are done correctly.\n\nAs for the gameplay, I don't understand why there are two action buttons, because the "activate" button pretty much does everything, including what the "grab button" does. Also it's a little weird sometimes because the way you solve a certain puzzle might not be as logical as one would expect, and at some point you might need a guide, hopefully there's a lot of them.\n\nThat being said, I'm having a lot of problems with it. The graphics randomly freeze but the game is still running, so it's impossible to continue the game, and if that happens, don't save it because every time you load the file, it wil be stuck in the same place. Also I had a few crashes when playing in fullscreen, so you better avoid that.\n\nSo you better save a lot, every-time you feel you are making some progress, save. So if it crashes you just load your file and there will be no problem.","November 6, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Awesome game musics make you stop at some scenes and keep listening the music till the end.

This game is of course remastered and looks alot smoother for it. There is a toggle option so that you can see how the game looked when it first came out but is not necessary for any in game unlockables or steam achievments.\n\nYou will like this game if you are a fan of other puzzles games such as the monkey island series but some of the puzzles can be unobvious as to what needs to be done and may well take up more time than you expect. That being said this game is well worth the time that you will invest and the story line is solid and will also provide you with many laughs along the way.\n\nI recommend this game out of personal preference but i would most certainly agree that this game will only be fun for a specific audience and/or to gamers who have patience and can listen closely to dialog. Sometimes the clues that you need will be in the dialog options that you choose and these clues can be obvious... but some of them will be a little more cryptic.","February 15, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've finished it twice in the 4 days since I purchased the game and I can definitely say I recieved my money's worth.\n\nYou play as Manny Calavera, a travel agent for in the land of the dead. In your adventure you must save the woman you love, foil a mob boss' plans and lead a resistance against the corruption in the D.O.D. It will take you around 12 hours (dependant on how long it takes you to figure out puzzles) and it has some of the most clever and funny writing I've seen in a game. This was Tim Shaffer's last project at LucasArts and It is still one of his best.\n\nAlthough the title says "Remastered" you're not getting a huge face-lift akin to "The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition" or "DuckTales Remastered". It's really just a few fixes to some lack-luster textures to make them look more appealing. If you want to play the game with the original graphics you can change between versions with the simple click of a button.\n\nAll in all, It is definitely worth your time and money if you're a fan of funny writing, difficult puzzles and adventure games.

In fact, everything about this game is excellent (minus one thing - more on that later). I'd played this when it originally came out and apart from some vague recollections about having to run all around a 1940s noirish city (Year 2), didn't recall much about it. Which is good. Apparently it's also good I no longer recall the original tank control system, haha.\n\nYou play as Manny Calavera, a Department of Death agent charged with selling travel packages to newly-departed souls in order to get them across the land of the dead and to their eternal reward. Except Manny's been getting so many less-than-stellar clients lately he decides to take things into his own (skeletal) hands and catch himself a real do-gooder, sure to qualify for the best package possible (and net Manny a big commission he can use towards paying off his own debt incurred by not leading such a stellar life). But things don't go as planned and Manny ends up trekking across the land of the dead, searching for the client that got away, trying to right all the wrongs that are being done by his department.\n\nA fascinatingly original story, combining Aztec/Mexican underworld myths with 1940s film noir, the game is broken up into four sections, each spanning a year in Manny's travels (though you're not playing through the whole year, thank goodness!). My favorite is easily Year 2, set in the city of Rubacava, where Manny finds himself the head of his very own cafe straight out of Casablanca - complete with piano player and gambling gendarme! There's also unionizing seabees (who are literally bees, heh), beatniks, and the big boss of the competing (and much more successful) gambling joint who has his own problems with women and underlings.\n\nYears III & IV don't seem as long or as involved as Year II, but maybe that's because they're not rooted in one spot and take place in many different locations. Year I is a lot of set-up (well-done setup) of the world and the main players and mystery, and is just fine, except I always wondered why Manny feels so compelled to climb that flag-thing so many times and for no apparent reason haha.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful and full of things to click on/interact with, the music is amazing, the characters' personalities are distinctive and their motivations consistent (and they don't feel like set-pieces for Manny to use or manipulate, even though he is doing that a lot of the time), the dialogue/narration is believable and I love how when Manny is directed to look at or use something, his narration (which is obviously for the benefit of the player) is sometimes overheard by surrounding characters who will then respond (though not to the point where they wonder why he's talking to himself so much tee hee).\n\nThe voice acting in this game is some of the best I've ever heard. Tony Plana is such a perfect Manny that I've never forgotten him and can easily spot him whenever he shows up on TV or in films (or at the theatre where I once worked!). Glottus is also great fun to listen to, as are the shady characters in Year II. And I can always spot Kay Kuter too (I know him from Gabriel Knight II).\n\nThere were a couple times I had to consult hints (which I hate doing, argh). In Year I, because of a pixel-hunting failure on my part. In year II, because I failed to connect what I saw in a picture with a line of dialogue I'd heard much earlier. Year III, I was frustrated with my seeming inability to interact with a character, and in IV I hadn't tried something I could have sworn I already had.\n\nMy only two drawbacks with the game:\n\n1) The inventory suuuuuucks. Ugh. I wish they'd changed this for the remaster. As is, you have to cycle through Manny pulling each object out of his coat before finding the one you want. A better way: another screen opens, all the objects appear as small tiles and you can then select the one you want.\n\n2) More nitpicky: something happens at the beginning of Year II that's always bugged me. Or rather Manny's lack of reaction to it has bugged me. A certain character actively impedes him from following - a move that's seemingly out of character at the time - and he never (far as I can recall) addresses this until he meets up with that character later on. Just a simple 'Why would she do that?! Something must be wrong!' after the cut-scene would have helped. Again unless I missed it, Manny reacts like nothing happened.\n\nOtherwise, a great game. Thanks so much for the remaster. Otherwise I wouldn't have been able to play. (Now bring out DOTT already!)","November 29, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never played this as a kid, but I knew of it as it is quite a famous game. Thought I'd get the Remastered when it came out on Steam to see what I was missing out on. Well, in terms of the story, the world and the cinematic presentation this game is a clear 10/10.\n\nHowever, the big issue for me is how the storyline is used to guide you into the puzzles/adventure. Essentially the majority of the puzzles are very abstract and there is little to no impetus from the story, no direction to what the game wants you to do. After all, you don't know the bits of the story to come, so some of the things you have to do seem illogical to the player, ie why am I doing this or why am I picking this up, and you often come by a part-solution simply by clicking on every single thing in the room and seeing how they interact with your inventory. Lots of trial and error...which isn't really puzzle solving, but grinding by chance.\n\nFor example, in Year 2 by talking to characters in game, you work out that you need a Union licence, tools for Glottis and you need to get rid of a sailor so that you can take his place on the boat.\nThe licence and tools are fine. But to get rid of the sailor you go through this super abstract puzzle sequence where you end up needing a metal detector, a set of the sailor's ID dog tags, some golden alcohol and a morgue doctor/coroner.\nNone of this is tied together logically with cut scene storyline, and neither by talking to the other characters.\nNone of the items make sense to pick up, since they are extremely odd items for achieving the goal of getting rid of the sailor.\nSo basically you can stumble across the solution bit by bit, but at no time do you play the sequence with the mindset of  "I think I should try this or this". It is more like "I have golden alcohol, does it work on this item, does it work in this situation" Click click click, trial and error.\n\nThe most playable levels are easily Years 3 and 4, where it seems the developers put a lot more effort into the storyline and tying together the puzzle sequences/what you are meant to do with the story. It isn't spoon fed to you, and the puzzles are still a bit abstract, but it is more clear what your goals are and the actions you do make more sense when you are doing them.\nYears 1 and 2 however, are simply weird for most part. There is often no clear goal given to you which in other puzzle games is usually given by characters or storyline, ie "We need to get over to that island". Hence find a way to get there.\n\nOverall for a puzzle game, I found this to be very hard, not mainly because of puzzle difficulty, but because of the lack of said puzzle context. Monkey Island, the Nancy Drew series, the Sherlock Holmes series and Machinarium are all more logical puzzle/adventure games.\nI still enjoyed the game, but it seemed more like grinding than puzzle solving at times.","November 20, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In terms of new stuff the work of Double Fine is just not good enough, some rework was done on the 3D textures, but you can only notice it when you press the backspace button, there you say: ahhh, so, IT IS different after all...\nI can say the coolest thing is the team commentary. As a developer it's nice to hear technical difficulties the team had to deal with at that time and there is funny stuff like when Tim tells that the Celso's voice actor thought it was an audition for Star Wars: Episode one. Concept art is also good, and I can say that besides that you can control it with the mouse (although I used the good old tank control system from the original version) and fonts, and nothing else was done (maybe some digitalization of the soundtrack but I couldn't tell), I don't think this few new features justifies a relaunch for a 15 USD price but I can say that as a fan of the franchise I totally paid for it to support it, nowadays you can find lame ports for mobile devices of SNES games selling for more than 10 USD so I think it's ok.","February 29","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice acting is above average and the characters and dialogues are great. The game looks good, albeit still quite dated, which doesn't impair my appreciacion of it. The navigation is very end of 90's which is unavoidable as all 'high resolution' 3D games of the time had to work with fixed backgrounds. The game works great on a story level.\n\nOn the bad side:\nMy biggest gripe with this game is the puzzles, which are typical for this type of games, specially from the Lucas/Schafer team: they are just too freaking hard to figure out. There is almost never a hint to how to solve a puzzle and logic doesn't help a lot either, so the player ends up walking around and around, trying every item he collected on every possible thing in the game and also going through every possible dialog. As there is only one path for the player, one may very well end up going around and around for hours before finally finding the missing clue. Not eactly my idea of fun, so I ended up playing the game with a walkthrough so I could at least enjoy the story (so far – I haven't finished it yet).\n\nOn a general verdict: this game is for nostalgics and for people who don't get mad at searching for a dumb puzzle piece for hours. That was okay, maybe, in '97, but nowadays, we players expect games to be a bit smarter than that. So let's say this game is from the Dark Ages of games where the player was considered smart if he had the patience to spend hours with dumb try-and-error procedures. Like many games from the Schafer team, the game doesn't actually give the player a chance to actually be smart to solve a puzzle. Instead, it leads him down a path where he will feel miserable because clues look like they could be solved with logic, but they can't. You just have to try over and over until you finally get your reward.\nAs I said already: not really my kind of fun. I might play through this game with a walkthrough, though.","April 4","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I may have only speny 11 hours on this, but those 11 hours are some of the best I've spent in ANY video game. Not only is it funny, charming, and it's incrediablely witty dialouge between characters will lure you so much to talk and interact with everything in sight to hear the wonderful voice actiong, but this game is also very deep and creative with the premises the game take inspiration from. Manny Calevera is now one of my favorite protagonists in any game. To see this game do SO well years after it's commercial flop in 1998 (correct me if I'm wrong), but also see it's visuals revamped is absolutely stunning to the eyes. After playing around with the rendering to see differences, I can say that the remastered version definately gives the characters (and the characters only) a GREAT facelift. The models may seem jagged, and the backgrounds remain the same and some animations run at 30 fps, I think  it's something that still leaves the game with an authentic 90's PC gaming that just gives me a nostalgia chill no matter what. My only problem is that the game "soft locked" on me during Chapter/Year 1 while switching between fullscreen mode and windowed mode, so I can only recommend to save VERY often in case of doing so. Also, advanced lighting requires a VERY high end PC, or else the game will just run very slower (The cursor, for instance, is very slow and has a huge input lag), so if your PC isn't top notch like mine, I can only recommend to, sadly, turn it off. Either way, the game looks BEAUTIFUL without it. Puzzles may be confusing, but that's only part of the challenge. Whether you're a newcomer to the genre of Point and Click adventures like myself or a veteran of the genre and possibly even a early player back in 1998, I REALLY recommend this game. It's REALLY worth the $15 price tag!","July 9, 2015","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never played the game back then, but somehow the cover stuck in my mind. Some years later I was browsing the Internet if I could buy the game, but I didn't find it anywhere. Now a few months back I found the game Remastered in Steam so I had to buy it and try it. The game is remastered so it kinda reviwed the old game back to life. It still looks old, but remastering the game makes it playable for a first timer. I think that if you play a really old game today, there must be a nostalgy factor in it or otherwise it's just going to suck for you. Remastering the game to 21th century makes games playable even without earlier experiences.\n\nACTUAL REVIEW: This is a point and click game which I very much enjoy. If you're not into point and clicks, this game is not for you. The game is an adventure game with lots of dialogues and humour and you advance in the game by completing puzzles. I love how the main character speaks English in a funny accent with Spanish words here and there. Love it. So far the story is very funny and I am eager to complete the story asap.\n\nThe only negative thing in the game for me is the puzzles. They didn't age too well. They are illogical and impossible. I can not complete the game without a walkthrough which I am going to use for the whole game. The story and the jokes is what I wanna experience and by using a walkthrough to solve the impossible puzzles I am gonne get just that.\n\nReally happy that they remastered this old title for me to play and have a good time. I suggest though that you buy this game on a sale and not for the full price.","July 16, 2015","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At least thats what I said when I first looked at it, but I proved myself wrong. I have enjoyed this game so far from what little playtime i have of it, and I'm sure I am going to enjoy it more in the future. The humor in this game is cheesy, but it works and I feel as though that is one of the focal points about what makes this game charming. If you enjoy point and click, and if you are a big fan of quirky humor then I absolutely recommend this game to you. Enjoy :)","July 16, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So many crazy funny characters and situations here... but i dont want to spoiler anything, just get the game yourself!\nAlso the "remastered" worked fine for me.

I REALLY enjoy point and click adventures. A lot nowadays are really good on story and pacing, the advenuring, mystery puzzle solving, has become really simplistic. Point and click adventures of the 90's were fun problem solvers but the stories were really simple and were mainly comedies. This is the best of both worlds. The puzzles are incredibly fun to solve and the story is so intresting. It is a mix of a mystery comedy sort that was surpursingly keeping me on toes and invested the whole time. The world of the dead is a fantastic angel to work with. All in all if you are a guy that is big on presentation graphicly, this may not be the game for you. If you are going through a 90's throwback phase, enjoy a really good point and click adventure game, or just want to hear an interesting story, this is a must buy.","October 18, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was not disappointed. This is a very unique and well thought out story with well fleshed out (pardon the pun) characters. My favourite is Glottis. You'll see why once you start playing. Some of the puzzles can be slightly tricky to get right, but none of them are overly difficult. I love the accents, the noir feel to some environments, the laugh out loud moments, and Glottis.\n\nThis is definitely a game that everyone who enjoys classic adventure games that have a good story, great character development, humour, and good puzzles. There is not a whole lot of replayability, but then neither do most adventure games.\n\nI give this a 9/10. Viva La Revolucion!","July 20, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
