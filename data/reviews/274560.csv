It has frame rate problems, the bullets blend in with the background, and generally it's a bit of a mess. But somehow when I was playing it, something made me look past all that and I really did have a good time. It has an upgrade system that definitely helps with the sense of progression, a fun but challenging boss at the end of each stage, and a neat system of air bullets vs ground bullets, forcing you to pick between whether you're shooting in the background or in the foreground.\n\nBut by far the best part of the game is the multiplayer. It takes all the problems I mentioned and kinda blurs them out of your mind, because, at least for me, I was more focused on playing a game with my friend and the issues became less glaring. There's also a cool multiplayer versus mode, which I've never seen implimented into a top-down shooter before. It works pretty well.\n\nAs a whole, Revolution Ace was like a fat guy sitting in front of you at a playoff game. It's annoying at first, sure, but if you can look past the problems, you have a great game in front of you. It's a fun experience, and you should definitely consider picking it up if you have some friends to play it with.\n\nPros Upgrades system\nInteractive environments\nInteresting air vs ground mechanics\nGreat multiplayerCons Frame rate issues\nBullets tend to blend in with the background\nLasts maybe a bit longer than it needs to","May 11, 2015","true","1.6"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","24","25","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/agw_ottawa/recommended/274560/","agw_ottawa","Sheep!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/agw_ottawa/","420 products in account","Revolution Ace was an interesting attempt to build a shmup in the Unreal Engine, which was not at all designed for the purpose.  The resulting game isn't a disaster, but neither is it a compelling success.\n\nThe appeal of shmup games typically comes from hectic action; your weapons are typically devastating, killing the weakest foes in one hit, and your fire rate is intense.  Challenge in a shmup typically comes not from any deficiency of your avatar, but the sheer numbers of enemies it sends at you, the intensity of their fire, and the speed at which they move.\n\nRevolution Ace departs radically from that standard shmup formula.  You and the majority of your foes move slowly, even sluggishly.  Your weapons are uncharacteristically weak, requiring a good second or so of concentrated fire to take down most normal opponents, who are comparatively few in number.  Instead of a hyperkinetic frenzy of ducking and weaving through enemy fire while opponents explode in dramatic fireballs all around you, Revolution Ace feels more like a slow, stubborn push through the enemy forces, hoping to make it through to the final boss before your armor is depleted.\n\nThe addition of true 3D modeling, switchable air/ground fire and recharging shield to the genre are interesting, but don't really make up for the loss of the speed and destructiveness that is the hallmark of this style of gameplay.","July 8, 2015","false","1.2"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","33","47","0","3"

I get to play in my own unique way and so does every other player.\n\nThe UI and soundtrack are good for what they are and I didn't run into any flaws minor or major, and the levels are interesting enough to keep me playing, though not distracting me from the gameplay. The enemies all have something that is unique about them and all have different patterns, because of this the screen can become a cluster of enemies and bullets if you're not fast enough at clearing them out, so watch the shield regen.\n\nSpeaking of shield, missed enemies do come back so sometimes if you missed an enemy or two you won't have the opportunity to regenerate your shield in an area that otherwise would've been clear, so if this happens you'll be left in a situation where you're being attacked without shields, which adds to the intensity to the gameplay.\n\nMy only gripe with the game is that the bosses are too easy and too predictable, at least in the few first stages.\n\nI recommend this game and shout-outs to senpai studios for giving me a free key for this game.\n","May 6, 2015","true","0.8"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","19","25","0","0"

Fight against entire air forces in campaign mode, play with friends in a co-op game, or choose skirmishes and dogfight it out with both air and ground targets, Revolution Ace also allows you to pit your skills against other players, in side-by-side, split screen fashion.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/274560/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Revolution Ace is a top down Shmup in where you fight enemies from both the air and the ground simultaneously. There are two keys that fires your weapons. One is to aim your projectiles in front of you and the other to fire at the ground below you. It can be confusing to tell on what plane an enemy is on and I would often times find myself shooting over an enemy. After a bit of practice and knowledge of the enemy it becomes a non-issue. Before getting to the gameplay you may want to tweak around with the graphic settings but be warned, turning on CSAA anti-aliasing will immediately crash the game for some reason. There are four modes in this title. Campaign provides a story and unlocks more levels for the other modes, Skirmish is to replay any mission you want and even some exclusive ones and versus has you and another player going through the same mission competing for score while introducing some new power-ups that hinders your opponent.\n\nThe last mode is called BattleChain that works similarly to versus though you play alone and later send the ghost data of your playthrough to the person you challenge. Campaign mode is where you'll want to start as it does it's best to introduce you to the mechanics of this game. The story of Revolution Ace has an interesting beginning in which the nations of the world built machines to fight their wars instead of wasting any human lives and the robots eventually stop fighting each other to launch a devastating attack against humanity. It has a very interesting premise but goes nowhere as they went for the “funny redneck” vaguely explains what you are doing on each mission route. No one expects a story from a Shmup though it did feel rather disappointing to start off with one and promptly forget about it. Throughout every mission you will be facing a horde of hostile robots in your cheap cobbled together jet in a last ditch attempt to retaliate against the enemy. It starts off as a suicide mission though after many successes you start gathering scrap that allows you to build much better equipment on your craft.\n\nThe more enemies you destroy the more scrap you collect once successfully completing a mission. You get much more scrap if you kill an enemy before it leaves the screen. If it leaves and comes back for a second barrage it will be worth far less. Scrap will be the most important thing in this game since Revolution Ace features RPG like progression in where newer unlocked weapons you can buy in the armory are better in every way compared to your meager starting equipment. You also level up by gaining experience and unlike scraps you still get experience even if you fail the mission. Leveling up sometimes means that you get to choose from one of many perks that increase damage for a certain weapon type, allows your shields to recharge faster and one that increases your overall health to name a few. Sometimes instead of being able to choose from perks while leveling up you will instead have new equipment available to buy in the Armory. You will be needing all the help you can get as this game is brutal and I barely managed to beat it even while playing through the entire game with someone else.\n\nThis would be a good time to mention the online multiplayer. It is great and I couldn't notice any lag or hiccups during 6 or so hours of playtime on two very poor internet connections. I wish more shumps would include online play as most have the option for two players but many of us can't take advantage of it. Funny that a 2 dollar game should include it and it's a feature I must applaud. This is one of the most graphically impressive shmups on the market as it runs on Unreal Engine 3 and features cool effects such as the water rippling when shot at as well as fancy explosions. It is a very nice looking game but there is nothing interesting to look at as most of the game is either in a bland desert, the sky or over water. Enemy designs are decent though this is where the game suffers the most due to the RPG system of this game. From start to finish the enemies felt very bullet spongy making the combat feel unsatisfying and utterly devoid of any flow as you spend way too much time on a single enemy while there are dozens more coming for you.\n\nThat makes it feel like a game designed around grinding instead of skill. It is possible to beat the game without any grinding, however bullet spongy enemies make it tedious task. Leveling up also unlocks weapon slots for your ship allowing you to place a few more guns on the side of it to shoot horizontally. You unlock the left weapon slot first and it takes quite a while to unlock the one on the right side making it feel like very artificial progression. We are the last hope to destroy the robot menace and the mechanic won't install another gun on your preferred side of the ship because we are not level 18? The RPG features of this game aren't subjectively bad as those that like the feeling of becoming more powerful and being able to take on more difficult tasks are sure to enjoy it but for those of us that prefer Shmups to have everything we need to stand a chance from the get go and skill being the determining factor in whether we are victorious or a pile of debris on the floor.\n\nWeapons variants range from bullets, lasers and explosives. Each unlocked weapon has different effects even if they are the same variant so make sure to carefully read the description as some weapons can't be shoot at ground enemies. Fighting ground enemies is kind of clunky as you have some type of auto lock feature while shooting at the ground so you may fire at the wrong target from time to time. It is very cool seeing a buggy riding around down in a desert shooting up at you and those add some strategy to game as you decide whether to fight the enemies in front of you or the ones below you. The projectiles on screen are shot by the dozens and is near bullet hell levels of crazy. Unlike Bullet Hells your ship's hitbox is pretty huge here and you can take quite a bit of punishment before meeting your demise. You have both a shield and hull health to protect you from exploding. It doesn't matter much if the shield takes damage as not firing your weapons will recharge its energy back, hull health on the other hand you do not want to take any damage to . The only way to heal hull health is via a semi-rare powerup that enemies drop and if your shields are completely down that means things have gone really wrong.\n\nShields can also be bought and replaced with different types such as ones that take more damage but recharge slower. The whole not shooting to recharge your shields gimmick is rather weird and will more often than not cause you to get overwhelmed as more enemies enter the fray. It makes for some rather intense moments where you have a split second to decide if you stop firing and try to hold out until some of your shield is recharged or to hold your ground and risk it all. These moments would be a lot more fun if the enemies weren't so bullet spongy and you could go out in a blaze of glory though there is no denying it will still have you on the edge of your seat. One complaint I have regarding projectiles is that some enemies shoot dark brown projectiles that are really hard to see in most cases. There is also this weird gimmick in where your ship randomly rises higher to the sky or lower in certain set points of the level. Bosses are giant enemies be they fortresses or battleships that will do everything it can to shoot you down. It is rather cool seeing them get desperate as their health is low and launching an all-out barrage of projectiles. In the end of the day this is a content packed shmup with online coop, some levels in Skrimish mode that randomly generate the game and many handmade missions to blast your way through. It is by no means a game that will take the world by storm but for its low price this is a game that any fan of the Shmups should at least take a look at.","January 10","true","6.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","16","20","3","0"

I will update this review if I reach different conclusions later.\n\nAnyway, this game seems fairly accessible at first. It is a pretty basic shmup that also later on features some lite bullet hell aspects. The actual movement of your ship is a little slow, and at first, your weapons arent very powerful either. However, as you gain credits via finishing missions and generally blowing stuff up, you can buy upgrades to your weaponry and shields that make this a bit more effective and a bit easier EXCEPT the games difficulty scales more quickly than you can upgrade, and so this actually becomes a pretty challenging game after the first couple missions. I'm level 7 right now and have wrapped up something like 8 or 10 missions so far. At this point, I'm dying pretty quickly even after my upgrades (which you can swap out between missions as well btw) and even though powerups are readily available. Still, I havent reached the point of frustration yet, as I feel the right combo of upgrades is really all it takes to get past the levels despite the fact that they seem scaled beyond your present capabilities as you progress.\n\nAs you level up, you also occasionally earn perks, which are basically permanent upgrades to your ship. There is actually a wide variety to choose from, so you will need to choose wisely here.\n\nThe graphics are pretty much on par with what you expect. They arent mind blowing, but they do look nice and fairly well represent the genre and the era the game hearkens back to. Speaking of....the music is also well in line with this. It gets a bit repetitive but still remains listenable throughout.\n\nAll told, I would normally give this about a 5.5 out of 10. However, the game is presently featured for under 30 cents, and it has trading cards as well, the value of which pretty much are equal to the cost of the game. So...despite the 5.5 out of 10, it's still pretty much a must own if you make use of the marketplace...and lets be real...for 30 cents or so, you will end up owning this at some point anyway.","May 16, 2015","true","1.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

If anyone has played the SNES game Super Strike Gunner, then this game is for you, it feels exactly the same as SSG did when I played it all those years ago.\n\nThere are some very nice ideas in this game, the verses and battle modes where you can compete against players are very fun indeed, along with the customizing of your aircraft, perk system, leveling system and NG+, it does give the game some replay-ability, although when you reach later levels (20+), I found the game just turned into level-grinding to get those extra perk levels.\n\nThere are some arguably minor bad points I got from this however, the main one being how short the game actually is. While I personally don't mind a nice casual game to pass the time, a little more content and a more challenging difficulty would have helped a bit, (you can easily go straight to the highest difficulty setting and ace the game).\n\nAnother point I would like to mention is how easy the achievements are to get, while some may see this as a good thing, some hunters might not enjoy the lack of challenge in acquiring the full set of achievements, again though I think this is more about personal preference than anything.\n\nOverall I was very happy with the game, even at full price I would have still bought this when it came under my radar, so 96% off was a total bargain for me. Putting the minor issues aside, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a nice casual game of this genre without a doubt, especially if you enjoyed SSG and the like all those years ago.\n\nIn conclusion, my personal rating for Revolution Ace is :\n\n8.5/10\n","May 14, 2015","true","11.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

First of all the trailers on the store page dont do justice to the game at all. I bought this one by just looking at price.\n\nTurns out it's as good or in some areas even better than Jets'n'Guns which is my favorite shooter. Did not expect this at all from such a simple looking shooter.\n\nA bit about the mechanics: game has a leveling system and scrap (money) you get from doing missions, multiplayer battle challenges etc. With these goodies you buy new gear and in the spirit of Jets'n'Guns it is pretty much mandatory to test things out and find the best setups. Skirmish missions can be done if you wish to grind for some extra scrap. Configurations do matter as the Campaign start becoming harder bit by bit but the real test are the awesome battle chains where you or someone lays out a challenge to others in form of a level completion replay. Others will try to beat your score and you will see in a replay how they did it. Fun starts when someone rips the score so high you really have to think how will i beat this. You might need to re-think your setup to beat the score. (Your opponent see how many times you tried to beat his score so dont humiliate yourself too much by trying a strategy that just doesnt work)  Eventually the score will climb very high as the same challenge is bounced back and forth until either side just gives up.\n\nMultiplayer system is very good - though be warned that it is quite confusing to use at first.  Check forums.\nGame also sports a interesting notification system where you get a message to your steam notifications bar that someone has beaten your score and it's your turn to try to beat the opponents score.\n\nIn order to not just praise the game there is a bit of criticism too: Lack of feedback everywhere is annoying. menus are unresponsive for some time too yet not greyed out. In missions hitting targets does not yield much of reaction. i'd also like to see a bit more animation frames on certain enemies for a more flowing visual game experience. And just what are those really tiny white walkers that fire missiles at you? No big things but give a rough feeling to the game.","May 13, 2015","true","8.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Online Co-op! More shmups need to be on steam and they also need to have online co-op.\n\nVery good upgrades and weapons customization. Your ship has slots in which you can stick weapons wherever you want. Look at the community hub for screenshots of the shop. You can place weapons on the wings to shoot sideways. You have "scrap" (money for shop), experience points for leveling up your rank (which opens more weapon slots), and perks.\n\nThe levels move slow and it may seem like a walk in the park towards the beginning, but don't let that fool you since you can find yourself easily overwhelmed all of a sudden. It's not a "bullet hell game" since there aren't 1000 bullets on the screen, but that doesn't mean you won't run into a bullet infested screen. This is definitely apparent in the later levels. The level of challenge is perfect with this one. It's not too easy and it's not too hard to make you stop playing altogether.\n\nBesides it having campaign co-op, you can split-screen battle a friend to see who ends up with the higher score. There are a few power-ups specific that appear in this mode which will affect the other player. It can either be positive or negative so that you don't just grab every one you see.\n\nYou have one life to beat a level, but you have two lifebars. One of them recharges when you stop shooting and once the other one is depleted, you die. Very neat feature.\n\nBottom line: If you're into shumps, this one needs to be in your library.","March 28, 2014","true","6.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It has everything that you could want in a modernized aircraft shooter, all of the aspects you know and love from back in the day with hints of more modern features such as customizable weapons, upgrades, a perks system and some cool multiplayer and challenger features brought to you by the "Battle Chains" mode. The lengthy singleplayer campaign is also a very welcome addition.\n\nGraphically, Revolution Ace isn't anything ground-breaking, but it's still pleasant to look at and is sufficient for the gameplay it re-introduces. The game is only really flawed by what feels like some overall polish and optimization issues here and there, FPS drops tend to happen somewhat often during later levels in the campaign, this can be helped by lowering the graphical options in the settings menu (though it shouldn't be necessary as my machine is capable of running games like Portal 2 with maxed out graphical settings). The user interface isn't fantastic either, it feels somewhat rushed and amateurish compared to the game itself, but the gameplay more or less makes up for some small graphical issues.\n\nOverall, this is a game I would happily recommend to anybody who enjoys some casual Shoot-Em-Up action. It's not a groundbreaking game, but it succeeds at what it sets out to do. Revolution Ace is worth it's price and is guaranteed to keep you entertained for hours.","June 2, 2015","true","9.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/outlaw953/recommended/274560/","outlaw953","Metal Bison [33rd]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/outlaw953/","263 products in account","Thanks to my good friend, LockeProposal of the highly insightful Curator Page named LockeProposal’s Big Day Out, I was able to take a look into this-aptly labeled-bullet hell title. At first glance, Revolution Ace is simplistic yet charming, with simple graphics and exciting gameplay even on the lowest of difficulties. After completing the first level, however, I knew I was in for a wild ride similar to that of Tyrian (as you will see this title being compared to all over the internet, and for good reason.) I do have a few offline hours in this game, so please do not be evaded by my lack of logged time.\nHere are some things that really caught my eye when starting up and throughout:\n\nGraphics - I’m not really a stickler when it comes to graphics, so some of the simpler textures in this game didn’t bother me; I actually enjoyed how the game presents itself, as it is pretty much all you would need from a game of this caliber. Besides, why bump everything into the graphics when the only thing you will be looking out for is enemy fire? All joking aside, the graphics in this title actually surprised me, looking into how the defeated enemies scar the landscape and at the intriguing water physics. I understand some individuals are only interested in games that present themselves with AAA graphics, but that mindset should really be looked past with this title.\n\nControls - From the beginning, you are presented with two modes of fire: air-vs-air and air-vs-ground. These two modes of fire can be accessed separately by clicking LMB or RMB, respectively, but can be remapped if needed. Movement remains standard in Revolution Ace, with your classic WASD keys or Arrow keys representing the various direction. I know I cannot speak for everyone with this, but the craft in this title controls quite nicely as dodging enemy fire while utilizing quick reflexes becomes more important as you progress. You will learn what MMB is used for later. I don’t want to spoil the fun.\n\nGameplay - There’s a reason it’s called bullet hell. Revolution Ace is a side-scrolling (for lack of better terms) shooter with the objective of scoring enough points to ultimately better your ship and-subsequently-bring more pain to the bombarding enemy forces. As stated previously, the ship controls nicely from my perspective and the gunplay is fantastic. What I found of particular interest (described in the next segment) was the customization, which allows you to upgrade specific components of your ship to fit the scheme of play you want. For instance, do you want to stick to the classic missiles and guns on your ship and use the basic shield? or would you prefer utilizing an automated laser turret mounted on your craft with a chain-gun mounted on front and heat-seeking missiles primarily for enemy aircrafts?\n\nUpgrade/Customization System - Here’s where the game really shines. Remember the mention of only starting with a basic gun, missiles, and shield? As you progress through the campaign, both Experience and Scrap Points-which acts as a currency-are gained. Starting at an early level, ship upgrades-such as improving damage by 10% as your ship drops below 25% hull-can be chosen to better customize your level of play; be warned that once you select a ‘Perk’ you cannot reselect, though you gain more as you progress. Along with these permanent upgrades, you also unlock Slots on your ship, which allow for even more guns and other attachments-such as the aforementioned automated laser turret. From where I am in the game, this system of upgrades and customization has really impressed me, as I have been intrigued enough to switch my style of play so that I can buy different weapons. What also sets this system apart from others is that each gun, though different, is necessarily better than another so it really just depends on how you use each one. Did I mention there are things known as Super Weapons that can be used when clicking MMB and are cooldown based? Those are also really fun.\n\nTL:DR - There may be things I left out, but I have not been able to play the various game modes as of recent, which-by concept-are very intriguing. Though I did not mention it in the base review, I did enjoy the fact that there are no Achievements in the game pertaining to beating the Campaign at multiple difficulty settings, which allows the player to go at their own pace. At this stage, I’d highly recommend Revolution Ace for its fast-paced, over-the-top gameplay. Just remember: you will get hit. A lot. Thanks for reading.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

The progression of upgrades and weapons is nicely paced, and there's enough variety to keep things interesting (new weapons/armor, perks, leveling up, etc). Boss battles are challenging but fair, even on easy difficulties. My only real complaint is that there's a very, very tiny delay (think mouse smoothing or something like that) between moving the mouse and the ship moving on screen. This looks to be a feature, but it took me some getting used to. Other than that, the controls are intuitive and responsive. Every time I died it was earned.\n\nThe graphics are much nicer than the screenshots make them out to be. The music and sound effects fit in nicely with the action and don't become annoying at any point that I've reached yet.

But the lack of in game temporary picks ups makes the usually visceral experience provided by the genre absent.  Levelling up and being able to customise are good additions though. Having two seperate fire buttons for ground and sky enemies would have surely looked better on paper than it feels in game. Would prefer all guns blazing and coming into contact with the first enemy they hit vertically on the screen. As someone who accidentally flips through text based tutorials I did not figure out that there were ground and sky buttons until around the 3 or 4th game.

Still, the performance is quite good, with solid 60fps even with multiple explosions on the screen.\n\nGAMEPLAYYou control a customizable ship, and your objective is to get to the end of each map and defeat the boss.

If you never liked this type of games when they were popular in the arcades, I find it hard that you will enjoy it now.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game is very challenging on every difficulty setting, and it can get really frustrating the more you play it: sometimes dodging enemy fire seems impossible, and some of the boss fights will require more luck than actual skills.\n\nSOUNDThe sound effects are very good and each weapon and ship has its unique sounds. The soundtrack fits the game and, while it is forgettable, it does give you enough strength to keep going.\n\nREPLAYABILITYEven though there is small amount of Steam achievements (only 19), multiple difficulty settings, online leaderboards, local and online multiplayer will keep you coming back to this game more than once.\n\nWhile it lacks in a story and the gameplay is very formulaic, there is much to enjoy in this game and you will spend mutliple hours trying to improve your ship and get higher scores.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neon_cacti/recommended/274560/","neon_cacti","feed the flies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neon_cacti/","383 products in account","Revolution Ace is an Indie Shoot'em Up reminiscent of other, older, games like Tyrian or Raptor. The game is made in the Unreal Engine so it has some quite nice features, one of which would be actual game depth as opposed to a "drawn" background. Graphically speaking it isn't the top, but it isn't the worst. Some projectiles look nice, while then you have others which look like a brown Big Bullet Bills which could've and should've been handled differently. The music is mediocre, but it could get boring after playing it for a while. Some of the things that disturbed me the most was the lag/skipping of the music in the Main Menu, which didn't happen in-game but as well the fact it takes so long to unlock weapon slots and for some Achievements did not unlock. Some ground units seemingly just passed through impassable terrain making it a lot more confusing and for some reason some of the air units look like containers, furthermore confusing me about which projectiles to use because of the way they all look alike. Sometimes the combat feels clunky and slow, while the enemies just rush past you(most of the time you won't clear the waves, even when the enemies return). Shields will also regenerate only when you aren't shooting, but the whole point of the game is to shoot and destroy enemies, so that might need a rework. I also noticed the first two bosses were easier than normal enemies. Overall this game has high potential but it need some polishing, or so I believe. One of the most fun things is the upgrades the game offers for your Aircraft. I'd suggest buying it on sale, probably.\n\n\n>I'd give it a 4/10\n>Pros: High customization, destroyable terrain(buildings), nice depth perception, some parts of the graphics are nice, solid UI, multiplayer and several game modes, has cards and achievements(though the achievements didn't unlock for me)\n>Cons: Buggy, confusing enemy patterns, feels somewhat clunky and slow while enemies are too fast(most of the shots will miss because of that), first bosses weren't that challenging(I don't know about the rest)\n\nCopy supplied by developer.","June 6, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The scrap system with unlocking weapons slots is works well. The regularly upgrading item shop will keep you changing out and trying new equipment each level. The sheild system is one of the best Ive seen in this type of game. It also sports a cool perk system which allows you to further customize the experience.\n\nWhile the technical and paper design is fairly strong, where the game falls short is the execution. The UI is challenging and you will more than likely accidentaly purchase a weapon twice or salvage something you want before fully understanding  the shop/equip menu. The art is quite bad overall with uninspiring visual designs in enemies, VFX and environment.\n\nThere are a few really good boss encounters and some of the enemy patterns keep the gameplay feeling somewhat unique throughout.  The majority of the regular enemies and the bulk of levels are fairly bland and the pacing feels flat. There are very few highs and lows which makes the game start to feel boring too quickly.  Ground enemies shoot up at you and its very unclear when you will get hit so it can feel cheap at certain points.\n\nOverall: Good design + Mediocre gameplay execution + Bellow par visuals.  I will give this a very soft thumbs up, but I only reccomend this game to hardcore vertical shooter fans that have a lot of free time on their hands.","July 12, 2015","true","1.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yeah, this kind of game takes attention to detail) which makes experience organic and skill-based without some weird unexpectancies ruining the ride. Bosses are kinda fun: those are simple enough in terms of mechanic, but as I said - no unexpectancies: new enemies require adaptation, but learning ways to counter them is fun enough. Levels show interesting ways of indicating change of pace - zooming in or changing direction of flight. Leveling system is grindy sometimes but it provides good boost in case of hard level as loosing it makes XP accumulate regardless.\nIt is also notable this game has enormous amount of additional gameplay capabilities: versus mode and stuff which should make it really good investment for prolonged amount of fun.

My favourite genre is twin stick shoot-em-up`s. Having watched some video of this game in action, I decided to take the plunge, was it worth it?\n\nMy God, yes it was. This game contains everything I love about the genre. Masses of different enemies, many many weapons to unlock and equip, colurdul, detailed levels, and so much more.....  I think the Devs were trying to recreate the shooters from the old school, and they succeeded, and them some. The love and attention that has gone into this game shines through, and it makes playing the game even more pleasurable.\n\nOne of the best features is the multi-player aspect, of sorts. If you get a good score on a level, you can decide to upload that level to the online leaderboards. It then becomes a challenge, and anyone who sees it, can have a go at beating your time/score. If they manage to do this, they can the re-upload the challenge, and send it back to you. I have been having a challenge with another guy for about 10 days now. It is so satisfying to beat their score, and send the challenge back to them.\n\nIn closing, if you are in ANY WAY interested in this type of game, you really cannot go wrong. For the price, you are getting a game that is going to take you a fair while to actually complete, and then you have bonus levels, and the afore mentioned multi-player challenge system.\n\nI whole heartedly recommend this game.\n\n10/10","August 10, 2015","true","2.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

If you miss an enemy they will be back a second time with a yellow border.\n\nIt is the combination of all of these factors in the escalating mission design that makes this a top shelf shooter.

Those can be fun, just moving the joystick, rapidly tapping on the 1, 2 or 3 buttons, destroying everything and picking up everything. Then when you die, you just insert more coins and continue the game. One simple playthrough. No headaches.\n\nSome may like it that way, but some might find it boring. How about this: an aircraft shooter game that you can play in the comfort of your home, with elements of customization; change weapons, upgrade armors. Gives you all the more reason to pick up drops than just aiming for the highest position on the highscore board.\n\nThat is what Revolution Ace is. It is an arcade aircraft shooter. But it isn't just any aircraft shooter. It is 30% shoot anything that moves, 30% strategy and deciding what weapons to use for which mission, and 30% grinding for experience, levels, and the currency to upgrade stuff. The other 10%? Oh, that's reserved for the multiplayer capability.\n\nSo if you like all the elements that make out the 100% of this game, get it, but only if you're a fan of aircraft shooters. It's not the top notch game in the market, but it's not all that bad either. I can definitely recommend this.\n\nHikumi gives this game, a 5 out of 10.","June 30, 2015","true","12.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

For the price, you're getting a good game.  However, as expected, for the price, you're getting a lot of issues as well.  The online functions of the game need a lot of work as the connection issues it has can kick you out mid game, kick you from the party after the mission, or make simply joining the party a living hell.  The game also crashes rather unexpectedly for no apparant reason.  During certain missions, if you're not host, enemies may be entirely invisible.  Also as you hit higher levels it becomes a grind fest to get the scrap and experience to keep steadily progressing.  Nor do you get a reward for every level up which is a relatively minor complaint.  The most glaring problems are the multiplayer and I think with work it will be great.  If you get this game, don't expect to be playing it with friends.  It is a great time waster to play by yourself however.  The weapons don't feel imbalanced and the enemies don't really feel cheap or overpowered.","September 20, 2015","true","14.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Yep, and not the fun kind either.\n\nFor starters Revolution Ace is very unfriendly to new players. I've played for 2 hours and my weapons were just as useless as when i started despite numerous "upgrades".\nAlso if you like playing this kind of game with a mouse, forget it; the sensitivity is way too low even on its maximum setting.\n\nThere are a lot of dopey design decisions, chiefly:\nPower-up's having a delay between their appearance and their availability.\nEnemy ship types which are impossible to destroy on their first pass without you taking more damage than them.\nIn-game power-up's which don't last long enough to be of any use.\nSuper-weapons which are either ineffective or take so long to recharge that you only get to use them once per level.\nShip and weapon upgrades that don't appear to make your foes any easier to kill or your ship any harder to damage.\nLevel-up 'perks' which are so ineffective that one questions their inclusion in the game.\nThere is an auto shield-recharge but by the time the game has realised that you're not shooting anymore, the screen has filled up again.\nAnd occasionally the game crashes on exit and prevents you returning to desktop.\n\nWhat's good about it?\nSome of the music is cool and I like the 3-dimensional landscape.\n\nOverall Revolution Ace is more frustrating than is really necessary. With so many excellent shooters available, there really is no room for this title; at least not for money.","May 16, 2015","false","2.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Other reviews mention other games like Raptor, etc.   The last time I played games like this was either in the arcade or with some DOS games.  It does provide some nostalgia.  You can mount weapons that are air to air only, air to ground only, or universal.   As you earn points from killing full waves and also total number of kills, as well as the fortress or bosses, you gain both a chance for perks with your level and also you earn credits to purchase newer weapons or older weapons to swap into your various mounts.  You can store some in your inventory once bought, to be swapped in as the mission, in your opinion, dictates.  You can replay any mission via Skirmish, there is a campaign, and there is co-op, and a believe multiplayer.  I simply played single player through the first 4 missions or so and via skirmish.\n\nThis is not exactly my sort of game.  Although I did play some of the earlier DOS games like this, enjoyed Galaga at the Mall, and especially enjoyed Xevious.  This game is not unlike them.   That's the main positive.\n\nThe negative is that it is not that responsive and given that it takes a much larger footprint to accomplish the same thing, I think you might be, in some ways, better off playing older/similar games.  The graphics are not astonishing, nor are they necessarily better.    In defense of the game, I'm simply playing this on an Intel HD 2500 gpu, with an i5 rated around 3.4 GHz.   Still, this is not the most efficient program, but then, DOS and even Win95/98 were much more efficient to run on a computer for this sort of program.\n\nSo, it is fun, but it is not all that responsive.  I found that, for me, the main issue, is that the keyboard response for the airplane is a bit less responsive than I like.  I had expected it to run more efficiently.\n\nIf you have a decent video card, which I'm sure doesn't have to be that modern, you probably won't mind.  But I caution that this is a greater slowdown than I found in Skyrim, Bioshock, most FPS games in my library, and the like.   But games vary.   Where I had no problem running Dead Island with consistently good framerate, there is no doubt that Dead Island Riptide runs sluggishly, at least during the tutorial.\n\nStill, I'd expect better from Revolution Ace.\n\nOther than that, the game is similar, although it seems a bit less fair than Xevious.   It seems you are challenged more from the lower part of the screen than Xevious and the like.   Nonetheless it is adequate, if you have the time to learn the patterns and have good responsiveness.  It's relatively fair, looks ok, and is enjoyable.\n\nI got the game on sale for a mere $0.19  , that's an incredible price.   For now, I'd recommend those with laptop integrated graphics to be prepared to be disappointed, although my set-up is a desktop.  But for others, the game should be adequate in performance.   It's nothing revolutionary or stellar.   But it does take you back to the arcade when you want it to.   If you have other arcade like games, reconsider before you pay much for this game.\n\nOn sale for the price I got it at, it's impossible to complain.  If you have a decent video card, and you don't have some arcade game in the vein of Galaga, Xevious, Raptor, or Zone 66 -- it's worth giving it try.  But if you had already one of those and are happy with their look and responsiveness, I'd say so far it isn't worth adding to the library unless you simply want something new to fill in the gap in that genre.\n\nI'm going to recommend it, but again, this is a rather lukewarm recommendation.  If you see one of the older games and they look good enough for you, chances are high they'll be more responsive.","June 25, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is a storyline but I don't care about it and neither should you. Basically you're destroying enemies, collecting cash, upgrading your arsenal, and repeating until boredom sets in. One of the other reviews on this page compares it to Tyrian...or was it Tyrian 2000? It might have been Raptor: Call of Shadows for all I can remember.\n\nAnyway, this isn't a difficult game to process. The challenge is in finding the weapons that suit your style of play. Everything else is fundamentals (dodge bullets). There are a large number of stages, but most of them play out the same way. There are numerous enemies, each with their own pattern and method of attack. Through any number of combinations, their aim is to destroy you. While campaign levels are structured in a manner similar to classic overhead shooters of the 80s, there are an assortment of random levels where anything can happen. All in all, this shooter doesn't give off a hand-crafted and thoroughly polished vibe. It's not like the average game by Cave* which has 5 stages that are  meticulous in their design and execution. This game has a lot of stages, and the common theme is "We have tanks, ships, and turrets, let's cram them wherever."\n\nCouple this lazy level-design with poor mechanics (the hit-box is too big), bullets that can blend in with the scenery, and the result is something that I should hate.\nBut I dont.\nWhat?\nYeah I know, I'm a guy with a Cave avatar, I should be a bit more particular about the shmups that I enjoy.\nBut I have to admit that I like this game.\n\nTo me at least, the most compelling aspect for some games is experimentation. One of my favorite games of all time is Guardian Heroes, and most of the time I just play Versus mode. GH is a fighter/beatemup with a hugely unbalanced cast of characters. When I throw them all into the arena, the results can be interesting. Additional variables such as the experience level (which affects stats) further change how things play out. A lot of that game is spent just playing with ideas. It's a fun game on its own, but the creative aspects give it a lot of dimension.\n\nRevolution Ace has this same characteristic in not just its weapon system, but also in the random stages. Numerous enemies and boss combinations can appear, which can result in a number of unique situations. Furthermore, by progressing through the campaign, the difficulty can be increased (through a +1, +2, etc system). Sometimes the results are really unfortunate. I recall one level where the boss appeared, but then the field did a 90 degree turn. So instead of the boss being in front of me, he was to the side, and I didn't really have the weapons to reach him at that angle.\n\nThe Battle Chain mode is interesting. This is an indirect-competitive mode. What you do is play through a stage, upload your score, and then another player can opt to challenge that score. Now what makes this mode interesting is that all of the combos and power-ups you grab, can have an affect on the opposition. Larger combos can spawn more enemies, power-ups can add more dangers, etc. If the opposing player succeeds in beating your score, then you can challenge the new hi-score, and so on, and so on. You can even save your replays locally, and play against yourself. It's a really neat idea, but to get the most out of it requires strong weapons**. Getting strong weapons requires some grinding.\n\nThe grinding aspect is most likely going to turn away some players. There are some compelling aspects to Revolution Ace, but they require an investment of time. Usually with 2D shooters we're given a game that takes 30 minutes to "complete" but a great many hours to beat without continuing, dying, and/or getting the highest possible score. With this game however, the campaign is much longer, there are numerous optional stages, and most of the hours are spent leveling up and affording the best gear. For some gamers the grind is compelling in itself, but for others, they'll want to get the kind of experience that can't be measured in raw numbers. That's not to mention that on its own, Revolution Ace is a poor 2D shooter. It has a lot of flaws that would sink other games, and yet I think it's fascinating.\n\nBut that's just me.\n\n*I hope I don't get tired of mentioning Cave by the time Mushihime-sama comes out.\n\n**And players too, can't forget them.","September 21, 2015","true","9.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There is a storyline but I don't care about it and neither should you. Basically you're destroying enemies, collecting cash, upgrading your arsenal, and repeating until boredom sets in. One of the other reviews on this page compares it to Tyrian...or was it Tyrian 2000? It might have been Raptor: Call of Shadows for all I can remember.\n\nAnyway, this isn't a difficult game to process. The challenge is in finding the weapons that suit your style of play. Everything else is fundamentals (dodge bullets). There are a large number of stages, but most of them play out the same way. There are numerous enemies, each with their own pattern and method of attack. Through any number of combinations, their aim is to destroy you. While campaign levels are structured in a manner similar to classic overhead shooters of the 80s, there are an assortment of random levels where anything can happen. All in all, this shooter doesn't give off a hand-crafted and thoroughly polished vibe. It's not like the average game by Cave* which has 5 stages that are  meticulous in their design and execution. This game has a lot of stages, and the common theme is "We have tanks, ships, and turrets, let's cram them wherever."\n\nCouple this lazy level-design with poor mechanics (the hit-box is too big), bullets that can blend in with the scenery, and the result is something that I should hate.\nBut I dont.\nWhat?\nYeah I know, I'm a guy with a Cave avatar, I should be a bit more particular about the shmups that I enjoy.\nBut I have to admit that I like this game.\n\nTo me at least, the most compelling aspect for some games is experimentation. One of my favorite games of all time is Guardian Heroes, and most of the time I just play Versus mode. GH is a fighter/beatemup with a hugely unbalanced cast of characters. When I throw them all into the arena, the results can be interesting. Additional variables such as the experience level (which affects stats) further change how things play out. A lot of that game is spent just playing with ideas. It's a fun game on its own, but the creative aspects give it a lot of dimension.\n\nRevolution Ace has this same characteristic in not just its weapon system, but also in the random stages. Numerous enemies and boss combinations can appear, which can result in a number of unique situations. Furthermore, by progressing through the campaign, the difficulty can be increased (through a +1, +2, etc system). Sometimes the results are really unfortunate. I recall one level where the boss appeared, but then the field did a 90 degree turn. So instead of the boss being in front of me, he was to the side, and I didn't really have the weapons to reach him at that angle.\n\nThe Battle Chain mode is interesting. This is an indirect-competitive mode. What you do is play through a stage, upload your score, and then another player can opt to challenge that score. Now what makes this mode interesting is that all of the combos and power-ups you grab, can have an affect on the opposition. Larger combos can spawn more enemies, power-ups can add more dangers, etc. If the opposing player succeeds in beating your score, then you can challenge the new hi-score, and so on, and so on. You can even save your replays locally, and play against yourself. It's a really neat idea, but to get the most out of it requires strong weapons**. Getting strong weapons requires some grinding.\n\nThe grinding aspect is most likely going to turn away some players. There are some compelling aspects to Revolution Ace, but they require an investment of time. Usually with 2D shooters we're given a game that takes 30 minutes to "complete" but a great many hours to beat without continuing, dying, and/or getting the highest possible score. With this game however, the campaign is much longer, there are numerous optional stages, and most of the hours are spent leveling up and affording the best gear. For some gamers the grind is compelling in itself, but for others, they'll want to get the kind of experience that can't be measured in raw numbers. That's not to mention that on its own, Revolution Ace is a poor 2D shooter. It has a lot of flaws that would sink other games, and yet I think it's fascinating.\n\nBut that's just me.\n\n*I hope I don't get tired of mentioning Cave by the time Mushihime-sama comes out.\n\n**And players too, can't forget them.","September 21, 2015","true","9.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Hell, I loved the water physics that was promised, but at the first level you play at night, from the middle of the map and onward, the frames drop real low at a point I no longer have control of my ship nor can predict the projectile paths like I did in every previous levels, so yeah, the game disappoints me, it has potential but maybe it should focus on performance a bit more, in order to give the players a smooth gameplay.","May 7","false","1.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

What we have here is quite the contrary indeed.\n\nWhile the use of Unreal engine on a shoot them up might have been a weird choice, the action in itself is slick and fanciful, there wasn’t a moment where I felt put off by the graphics. The implementation of a physics system meant you can see you enemies explode in a multitude of ways as well, with debris causing ripples across the sea or scraps rolling down the hill.\n\nThat said, the game did suffer from some pacing problems with awkward windows where nothing spawned screen for ages, ruining your combo. The boss designs also suffered from a lack of creativity too, with a few so mundane that made the battle felt underwhelming.\n\nThe most noteworthy feature is the lengthy campaign, which has 18 stages in total spanning 4 to 8 minutes each. If that wasn’t enough to justify purchase, there are also procedurally generated challenges made with seeds, along with two multi-player modes. So if you aren’t completely sold upon first glance, you can always count on replay value instead.\n\nAll that aside, you can definitely do a lot worse with 2 bucks on Steam, so there’s no reason not to give this title a try.","December 29, 2015","true","12.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsc/recommended/274560/","rsc","RSCNyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsc/","106 products in account","This game has so many problems.\n\nNo story to really speak of, you seem to be attacking some Middle Eastern area, left unnamed, as far as I can tell. Visually, it's not bad. The models look pretty nice, and there's some good effects like the water rippling when you drop a bomb. Nothing that will blow you away, though.\n\nSound, some buttrock/Middle Eastern music mix, and sometimes just some buttrock. And not the funny/good kind. Sound effects were also lacking, and it all just started blending together after a while. None of it stands out.\n\nGameplay is where the game really suffers. The game is dreadfully slow by shump standards (Especially due to the numerous tutorials that pause the game): Even the most basic enemies can withstand seconds of constant, focused fire, Multiple enenies will often overwhelm you just because they take so much damage. You can take a lot of damage too: You have a shield, and armor. Once your shield is drained, you'll start taking armor damage.  Your shield will regenerate if you stop firing...and it regenerates extremely slowly. Also, not shooting in a shump? In fact, in one of the loading screen tips, the game encourages you to bypass 'weaker' enemies, so your shield can regenerate. Well, you can't do that too often, because again, the game loves crowding a lot of enemies on the screen, and this means you'll likely take damage regardless.\n\nThe enemy design is alright, there's a variety of air and ground targets. It's just, again, it takes way too long to kill either of these, and some weapons are air-only or ground-only. Keep this in mind for later.\n\nThe boss design, on the other hand, is absolutely awful. Way easier than the stages themselves, every boss has a very blatant weakness and they're just...not fun to fight at all. There's one boss that does two things: Fires mines that go to where you are on the screen, and fire bullets downwards towards you in a spread. Problem: Boss is in the middle of the screen, so you can simply go above it and be completely safe from all it's attacks. The bosses were just really not exciting or fun to fight in the slighest.\n\nAs you complete stages and destroy enemies/buildings, you earn levels and scrap to use in the shop. Levels unlock new gear for purchase, and you can acquire perks that give you minor upgrades that seem mostly ignorable. Scrap is the currency in the game, and the shop is where things really fall apart. You can purchase main weapons, sub weapons (missiles, bombs, etc.), super weapons (screenclear bombs), and shields. The problem is you can't tell which items are good, and which ones are absolutely awful.\n\nUpon reaching level 4, I unlocked a variety of main weapons: A defense laser, and a chaingun. Feeling like my firepower was severely lacking, I took a chaingun, which was air-only, and air-to-ground missiles. Sadly, the chaingun was really bad, firing in an uncontrolable spread, and only firing in bursts with a cooldown in between. With it, it was impossible to clear the stage I was on, and quickly went to sell the weapon back. And here's where my biggest problem with the game shows up.\n\nThe game won't tell you how much scrap you will receive when you're about to sell something. I was assuming a 100%, or close to 100% refund. Nah. It was something like 25%. This means I was not only unable to re-buy the chaingun, I couldn't afford to buy my default weapon again, which was more expensive for whatever reason. I was forced to sell all my missiles (I had anti-air missiles as well). I was forced to purchase the defense laser, which was really poor at actually killing things. Naturally, the current stage I was on was impossible with this weapon.\n\nThen it dawned on me: This game expects you to grind. A lot of the items you can purchase are extremely expensive, and you will need to go through stages over and over to earn enough scrap to afford them. Or, if you're like me, you can be thrown into a literal unwinnable situation, just because you had the audacity to purchase a new weapon because you think it would be better, based on vague information.\n\nThat's when I quit playing. I usually finish games (if possible) or put a decent amount of time in them before typing a review, but I honestly didn't feel like grinding the first level 4-5 times just to purchase a weapon that wasn't awful, and then MORE grinding just to get a subweapon. There's ways to put shops in your shumps in a way that isn't awful (U.N. Squadron/Area 88 comes to mind), but the fact you can potentially be stuck in a position where you have to either completely restart, or grind for ages just because you bought something from a shop? It shows that no one tested the shop system to see if such a thing was possible.\n\nThe game was bland and boring as it was, but the shop system pushed it over the edge into the "Really Bad Game Sea". It's one of the worst shumps I've ever played, and I highly encourage that, even at it's current price, that you do not purchase this product. There's way better shumps out there, especially on Steam.","June 21, 2015","false","0.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bosky/recommended/274560/","bosky","Olrac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bosky/","236 products in account","Okay wow this is an unexpectedly good game. Bought it randomly for $0.25 (ironically like inserting a single quarter into an old timey arcade machine).\n\nFirst of all my background: I played ~300 hours of Raptor Call of the Shadows when I was growing up (shareware version from a magazine, then I bought the full version that Apogee mailed to me on floppies).\n\nIf you loved Raptor you'll love this.\nIf you saw screenshots of Raptor without understanding it, or prefer Japanese-style bullet hell shooters, or side scrollers, you might not like this.\n\nThe tactical combat is almost exactly like Raptor, right down to most enemies shooting yellow orbs at you (and the "wave" gun and auto-targetting laser). You will take damage, that's unavoidable, so shield/armor management is an important part of each level (just like Raptor). You can equip multiple weapons with vastly different weapon patterns. Target priority and order is very important, as is deciding between air and ground. Lots of neat enemies and some fun levels with your plane flying higher/lower or the view rotating.\n\nFirst some complaints I read, but didn't experience. Not sure if the dev just fixed them over time or if the original issue was wrong. Either way:\n- Grinding - There was grinding in Raptor. If you don't think so you didn't play Elite difficulty, where you had to farm the lower difficulties for money and upgrades. Even before the final Outer Regions waves you'd farm the earlier levels that dropped shields to have more than the max. So redoing some missions or a bit of skirmish here shouldn't be unfamiliar or unfun.\n- Performance - Ran fine for me. I didn't have an fps counter on, so maybe the framerate dropped, but projectiles were still dodge-able and there was no visible stutter. When playing the graphics actually look better than the screenshots.\n- Slowness - For the screen/view size the plane is almost exactly as fast as Raptor. Again, expectations.\n- Anemic Weapons - Depending on your loadout you might have to stay on a target for a bit. There are few one shots here. No surprises considering how long even late-game Raptor took to kill some enemies. This means you need to get used to how many shots it takes to kill an enemy, and not waste more than that.\n- Hitboxes - Your plane/ship seems accurately represented, and I've dodged shots by what felt like pixels. Sometimes enemies have deceiving hitboxes in regards to their shape, but that's pretty rare.\n- PhysX - Someone mentioned needing older Nvidia drivers for this game. I ran it fine with the latest drivers at the time.\n\nSo basically a lot of the complaints can be explained as: that's how Raptor did it.\n\nIf I DID have a complaint with the game it's that incoming enemies don't have shadows, which makes it a bit hard to be pre-firing at the right area. The backgrounds can similarly be a bit distracting/overwhelming at times. And the weapon and equipment could use better ordering or sorting in the shop. Not anything game breaking though.\n\nBut that is balanced but a dozen pros, a few of which I'll list here:\n- Random Levels - I would have killed for this feature as a kid. You can choose a seed and get a random level complete with a boss. So fun and so replayable, and really adds enjoyment to any "grinding" aspect. In addition the campaign is 20 levels, plus another 4 unique plus 8 types of random for skirmish.\n- Shield Recharge - Shields have a recharge delay and rate which kicks in once you start shooting. Managing this is a lot of fun and adds a new dynamic.\n- Enemies Return - If you don't kill an enemy they come back later (and reward less scrap on death). So levels quickly spiral if you miss kills.\n- Ground and Air - Very fun switching between the two, and it's a bit more seamless than Raptor where you'd have to swap active weapons. Here you just hold "Shift" to fire any available ground weapons.\n- Builds - With perks and such varied weapons you get a lot of choice to each playthrough. You could focus on Plasma, or maybe go for rebounding missiles, or rapid firing machine guns.\n- Modes - Some really unique and imaginative modes outside the main campaign, such as competitive "Battle Chains". Great amount of content for such an inexpensive game.\n\nIn summary the best way to describe this game is an underrated gem and spiritual successor to Raptor. I'm sad for the dev that it didn't get more initial praise and seems to be misunderstood by the majority of the community.\nWell I'm happy to say as a hardcore Raptor player this hits the EXACT right spot.\n\n(And if your time is worth anything at all, in the time you read this review you earned well over the price of the game","May 13","true","7.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Revolution Ace, by Laser Guided Games, takes you exactly there.\n\nGraphically this game looks crisp but also feels like a lot of free assets went into the game, I might be totally wrong but some of what I found in the game looked very generic. Speaking of generic, the actual plane that you'll be flying is actually probably one of the weakest assets in the game.\n\nI love the background music, it definitely fits in with the arcade theme feel that this game is going for. I do really wish that there was a little bit more sound outside of the background music, this actually makes the game feel a bit weird.\n\nMy biggest issue with the game has to be the random crashes. I'm not sure what causes this to happen but there's definitely something odd going on when you're in the middle of the level and the whole game shuts down.\n\nAnother issue that I see with this game is the armory/money system. I'm not a fan of the pricing in the game, and the whole store just doesn't feel all that right. Now that being said I was using a gamepad, as this is the type of game that I feel SCREAMS gamepad, but perhaps I might be wrong.\n\nThis is a valiant attempt at making a top down shooter that has challenging gameplay, interesting levels, and some cool power-ups, but there's just something missing from this game that makes me want to keep coming back. I just think that this game has this unfinished feel to it, and maybe there's a lot yet to come, but as of right now this is a game that unless you are a DIE-HARD top down shooter, have to have every top down shooter known to man, type of person, this is a game better off left alone. This game gets a 5.6 out of 10.","June 30, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A quick check on its Steam page shows almost 400 reviews with a “Mostly Positive” rating. However, this genre resurrection is paid at a high price as most of the systems that made the genre popular in the first place have been sacrificed in favor of grinding and a generic power fantasy mechanic. There is obviously a market for this type of gameplay but I don’t see much intersection with the fanbase of the older style of sidescrolling shooters."","July 1, 2015","false","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can be left with nothing, which isn't a good sign for areal combat :)\n\nOverall this game was enjoyable until they introduced an aerial type that shot zigzag, I had no clue on how to get onto them :I And in the end my eyes hurt from playing this...\n\nBut I believe that someone out there will see this game as his favorite, also a shout-out to the developer for giving me the heads up on this game~\n\n7/10 Don't think I will return, but I think this game has potential to become something bigger than it is :)","May 6, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

You shoot the enemies with little pixelated pellets that go through your enemies without clear indications that you've done any type of damage to this unit. Enemies you miss go off screen and reappears after a short while with yellow outlines to indicate that this was the unit you didn't manage to kill earlier. It would be easier to kill them if the screen was longer then it is wider making you go left and right less often and if your ship could move a little bit faster it would certainly not cause any harm.\n\nI want to give this game a second try but the graphics are so bland that you actually have trouble understanding what is happening.\n\n4/10","May 14, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

As mentioned from other players, the gameplay feels too slow and clunky, the leveling, perks and choices of some better and more powerful weapons (from gathered scrap) seem nice, but it doesn't improve your efficiency towards the enemy as it should, which is really bad for a game such as Revolution Ace wants to be. I think this is the point when you stop playing, besides poor graphics, poor level design and poor story (did it really have a story?;-). Anyhow, it cost me only 19 cents on sale, so ...

This game is really fun; there's almost no learning curve, you can play it on a potato and if you were a gamer in the 80s and early 90s, this will bring you back there.  "It's a ripoff of Raptor" blah blah blah shut up.  Do you really think Raptor was the first of it's kind?  Guess what?  It wasn't.  Not even close.  Anyway, Revolution Ace is a lot of fun.  It isn't perfect, but it's basically 27 cents right now if you include the other 3 games, so why not try it?

It reminds me a bit of Air Attack HD only not as good. The graphics, music and mechanics are OK and it really plays up the 2 1/2D element, but the game just lacks the fun of similar games. It moves at a kind of pedestrian pace, enemies kind of fizzle and it isn't always obvious they're dead, and the level design is just OK. The dual attack system kind of feels in the way of the fun sometimes. Enemy attacks are sometimes inescapable which makes it seem frustrating. A little more effort in the design would make it more replayable. Local co-op play is a bonus, but it's no Crimzon Clover.","March 31","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It fails.\n\nNow while the game does try earnestly there are just some decisions that seem to have doomed the game to banality. As with Tyrian and Raptor, you can earn money to buy upgrades and weaponry; unlike Tyrian and Raptor, the addition of a leveling system pretty much means it becomes more about grinding than it does skill.\n\nThen there are the graphics: in games such as this it is extremely important for the player to be able to see what they are shooting, what they are hitting and what is shooting at them. This game kinda falls flat in that department. A more vibrant palette would have done this game a world of good.\n\nAll in all , this game might have been better if it had just been polished a little more. As it is, I cannot recommend it.

It reminds me a bit of Air Attack HD only not as good. The graphics, music and mechanics are OK and it really plays up the 2 1/2D element, but the game just lacks the fun of similar games. It moves at a kind of pedestrian pace, enemies kind of fizzle and it isn't always obvious they're dead, and the level design is just OK. The dual attack system kind of feels in the way of the fun sometimes. Enemy attacks are sometimes inescapable which makes it seem frustrating.

That said, it's a pretty fun game.  100% worth getting if it goes on sale.\n\nThis game is easily doable with just a mouse (make sure to enable "Mouse Move"), and is good for running campaigns.  I tried to figure out a way to get the precision of movements with the mouse, with the long-distance movements of a keyboard, but it ended up a mess, so I just stuck with mouse-only.  However, when you get into Battle Chains, you'll either want a very big mousepad, keyboard controls, or a handheld controller (most recommended).\n\nThe beginning is pretty boring and sucky because you have crap weapons, and the good stuff doesn't appear towards the end of the first campaign.  My recommendation is to put it on easy and push for level completion asap, as gear and perks are locked by level.\n\n[BEGIN SPOILERS]\nAs a side note:  Play through the first campaign once before going back and picking your perk/equipment.  Some people like the auto lasers, some people like homing missiles, some like chaingun spam, some people like the "death ray penetrator", etc.  Your build depends highly on what's available, and only until you have all your slots and weapons will you be able to form a solid build.\n\nThe most useful weapons for you early on will be your machine guns.  Because you only have two slots, and you're given missles which only hit Air-To-Air (ATA), you lose half your effective power against ground targets.  Because machine guns can hit both Air AND Ground, you don't lose your effective power using them (and because you only have a few slots available, you need to make the most of them).\n\nYou should be able to unlock **First Purchase and **Perky within 10 minutes.  And then **Unleash the Power and **Rejected within 30 minutes.\n\nAfter the end of the first campaign, you should be close to, or have just unlocked your last weapon slot (everything is unlocked at Lv16).  Once all your slots are unlocked, you can choose/tune your build.  Completing the first campaign will unlock **Victory is Mine.\n\nAfter you play around a bit with what you want to play with, create a new profile and start over again, picking the perks pertinent to your buildpath.  The new profile will also help you unlock achievements  **I Am Superior and **Long Running Series as you can play Verses Mode and Chain Mode between your two profiles..\n\nThe campaign can be played through 3 times on a profile.  The first time is normal, next time is called "+1", and the final time is "+2".  After that, the option is locked out, and you are forced to skirmish or battle chain.  At the end of +1 Mode, you will get **I am the Master.  You should also have completed **Powerful, **Super Master, **Ace, **Spam This!, **Careful Planning, and **Elite.  Possibly even **Millionaire, though I didn't unlock that until I started doing battle chains against random people.\n\nNow that Campaign Mode is locked out, it's on to Skirmish and Battle Chain Mode.  Soon you should unlock **Catch 'em All with the new powerups.  Also, depending on your superpower, you should be able to drain/black-hole the red ship to get **Seeing Red.\n\nAfter you chain a few times against yourself (I would suggest hanging around the last boss and letting your score surpass the other's by just a little bit), you'll get **Long Running Series.\n\nThe last two, **Just Too Giving, and **Combo Master, will require you to kill a *TON* of spammy things; I was finally able to unlock them by doing the "Random - Sky (+2)" level with 2 chains.\n\nAlso, as a side note, you can set levels to +3 after +2, though I'm not sure what the difference is.  Possible bug?\n\n[END SPOILERS]\n\nYeah, I got this game for under a dollar on sale in Steam, and it has provided me with many, many hours of enjoyment.  Definite thumbs up.","November 7, 2015","true","41.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed those...\nI actually have similar games like that, but they arent as much fun as Revolution Ace.\nOne Reason would be that i got a lot worse at these kind of games with age...\nAlso, you only have to complete map after map with breaks in between, you modify your plane in the Armory by your choices and go to Battle with your setup. You are not bound to get better weapons and upgrades ingame, while u have to beat lvl after lvl after lvl (oldschool)\nSo apart from the real arcade legends this has a more casual and easy approach and encourages to keep playing for dat next gun/perk/weapon slot.\nThis is an addictive mixture if you are a fan of the genre and you can even play it coop!","May 19, 2015","true","19.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It fails.\n\nNow while the game does try earnestly there are just some decisions that seem to have doomed the game to banality. As with Tyrian and Raptor, you can earn money to buy upgrades and weaponry; unlike Tyrian and Raptor, the addition of a leveling system pretty much means it becomes more about grinding than it does skill.\n\nThen there are the graphics: in games such as this it is extremely important for the player to be able to see what they are shooting, what they are hitting and what is shooting at them. This game kinda falls flat in that department. A more vibrant palette would have done this game a world of good.\n\nAll in all , this game might have been better if it had just been polished a little more. As it is, I cannot recommend it.

It reminds me a bit of Air Attack HD only not as good. The graphics, music and mechanics are OK and it really plays up the 2 1/2D element, but the game just lacks the fun of similar games. It moves at a kind of pedestrian pace, enemies kind of fizzle and it isn't always obvious they're dead, and the level design is just OK. The dual attack system kind of feels in the way of the fun sometimes. Enemy attacks are sometimes inescapable which makes it seem frustrating.
