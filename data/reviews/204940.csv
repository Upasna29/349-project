Shame the grandeur tends to also come with a small helping of bugginess. Crusader Kings 1 is perhaps the poster child for that. The title was initially developed by an outside studio, with a similar style to Europa Universalis but in the Middle Ages with a focus on families instead of nation states. Unfortunately, the outside studio kind of screwed some things up. Even with all the fixes eventually given to the title, there are still random quirks that don't work like they should.\n\nStill the grandeur honestly makes up for many of the blemishes. It is a pleasure to lead a family of small time counts to the head of the known world. Unfortunately, once you know the mechanics, you really have to hold yourself in line to not use them all. It's extremely easy to min max your way to a thorougly boring second half of the game. Don't give in to temptation, and you're treated to stories that can be great fun to remember and share, like the count who went mad, killed everyone, then just sort of sat there with no heirs til you inheirited from the people who were grateful to not have to put up with him or his heirs. Stories that grow out of the gameplay are really the draw from this title.\n\nAlso try looking up the Dynastic Glory program. It lets you parse your save game, and compare your family tree to those of other great families. It opens a whole new way to make a mark on the world, spreading your seed far and wide to have your namesake, if not yourself directly, as the top of all the houses of Europe.\n\nOverall, Crusader Kings represents a really interesting game style that should be experienced at least once. You may want to go for a less buggy or more accessible model though. Try Europa Universalis 3, for example. 3/5","November 25, 2013","true","152.7"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","33","36","0","2"

It has mechanics of Europa Universalis 2, the warfare, the economics, the diplomacy but unlike that grand strategy epic, this grand strategy epic portrays you not as some nameless entity ruling your nation through the ages but as the head of a noble medieval family, your faith not tied into the success of the nation you rule but the rulers themselves.\n\nYou start the game by picking which family to control, you can start off as a great King yes but you can also choose to play as a powerful Duke or even an impoverished Count. You then set about forging alliances, mostly through marriage, produce offspring that can one day take over the mantle of leadership and assert your claim to various noble titles. As you grow in power and influence new challenges will arise. Conquer too quickly and others will see you as a warmonger, your vassals may grow too powerful and seek to claim your titles for themselves and should you have too many children they may differ over who should rule when you are dead.\n\nEach character has a set of characteristics and traits that wouldn't feel out of place in an RPG. Some traits are purely positive while others make you an inept ruler. Each trait also has an opposite, brave to cowardly and so forth and characters with opposing traits will often dislike each other and this all works together to create a great web of intrigue that makes holding together a great Kingdom a real challenge.\n\nThis great seat of intrigue and dynasty building is not without it's flaws however, the lack of any sort of proper tutorial and the rather extreme wealth of information you get showered with from the moment you start up the game makes it near impossible for newcomers to get into the game and even veterans of Europa Universalis 2 will find themselves struggling to keep up with the flow of information.\n\nAll in all Crusader Kings is an extremely complex dynasty building game that more often than not throws you into the deep end and see if you can figure out the diplomacy of marriage politics before you die without an heir or have to resort to incest. It is a fun game, once you learn it but unfortunately most people will quit long before that.","May 31, 2013","true","259.8"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","33","37","0","0"

In the last month and a half I've been playing CK for about 100+ hours (initially purchased in GoG), and this game got me hooked so bad that I have not even touched the new StarCraft Legacy of The Void expansion, and by the looks of it, I'm going straight to CKII after I finish at least one full game, from 1066 to 1453.\n\nIn CK you manage a royal dynasty, a Monarch and his blood line, and of course his kingdom, and his religion. You can conquer as much land as you want, bringing the Catholic faith to the heathens at the same time making sure they have the ruler they need, that means you and your descendants.\n\nCK is a Grand Strategy game, players from the Civilization series, or Total War series, won't be having hard time enjoying it, but this doesn't mean the game is just like those games, or any other game for that matter (well, maybe except for Crusader Kings II or Europa Universalis), The blend of strategy, royal dynasty simulator and the random events create a unique and fun game, even the story telling that is created every time you play a game is a big part of the fun. One time I got my father and my grandfather beatified and sanctified, and later on the pope made me Emperor.\n\nThe game sessions are not shorts, and this may be a turn off for some people, you can easily spend 80+ hours in one game, specially if you start in 1066 AD, but this kind of games can create a very deep story of your royal dynasty.\n\nThe game plays much like a board game, you will be looking at a big Europe and its surroundings A LOT, looking at your lands and the lands of your enemies and possible targets, you will be spending a lot of time looking at your family, making sure your successor is a worthy one, because when your current monarch dies, the successor will be having th time of his life trying to hold together the great kingdom that just inherited together, some of his vassals may find they don't like him very much and will try to declare independence. These are the times you will know the meaning of ruling with an iron fist.\n\nEven if there is Crusader Kings II, this game deserves the chance of being played. Even if you just play ONE full game, with all its faults and weird design decisions, CK is worth playing.\n\n8.5/10","December 11, 2015","true","38.9"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","15","15","2","3"

In my most recent game, my ruler's youngest illegitimate son and steward (and a fine one at that), attempted to install himself as the king's successor and failed. Last night, he assassinated the king, but the crown fell to the eldest legitimate son (more powerful than even the king), making him King of Aragon, Castille, Navarra, and Portugal. Of course, all this happened after a round of strategic assassinations, opportunistic marriages, and timely wars.\n\nPros:\n-Tons of events (good and bad) in your realm that make each game special\n-THE PAUSE BUTTON (so helpful)\n-If you have the money and prestige in-game, you can do pretty much anything you want.\n-The game is pretty balanced.\n-It rarely gets boring. First, you have to claw your way to the top, which is difficult but not impossible. On the other hand, once you're on top, the game may throw something your way that can cripple you. You're ALWAYS on your toes.\n-Relatively few bugs (mostly a few graphical ones with troops being shipped overseas).\n\nCons:\n-No instruction manual or tutorial. (Although, there is a fantastic series of tutorial videos on YouTube.)\n-It's difficult to play at first (but that will get easier with time).\n\nIt's a great game with near endless possibilities for only $9.99. If you don't feel like shelling out the full amount for Crusader Kings II, get this game instead.

Every thing you do WILL have an outcome to be thoughtful. Civilization, Total Rome, and Fable 3 all mixed together.\n\nThe Negative:\nThis game has a hard learning curve but totally worth it.

There is quite a steep learning curve when you first start the game, there is no instructions, no manual, but that’s what makes it fun. Crusader Kings is a perfect example of one of those games that gets amazingly good after you have mastered the arts of playing, and it excels in both storytelling, and depth. Whatever you do in CK will affect all aspects in what happens in the moment, but also in the future also. Its set in the Medieval ages, so lots to do and a hell of a lot going on also, whether you are introducing new religions, waging war, or managing finances. What makes this game so unique and unlike other games in the genre, is the weird, and quite strange happenings that occur in the game. Some according to your actions, some dam right peculiar! Besides the diseases, random suicides, and acts of war declaration from your vassal, you wife will threaten you and try to make you buy the latest fashion fad. However, I just told her to go to church instead, that little quarry rightly resolved if I may say. I could write up a load of other little events, and often pleasurable instances which occurred in this game, but you really must try it for yourself.\n\nIn the end really I must conclude to the fact that Crusader Kings truly is a good grand strategy game, but not one of the best, and due to the amazing success of its spiritual successor CK2, a game that often is forgotten. Its worth a buy for sure if its on sale, but I wouldn’t go out of your way to purchase it, as after all Crusader Kings 2 is soo much better I must stress. Nice to play a game that led to CK2, or the likes of Sengoku, but not a game I would spend too much time on I guess.For me though, it will be forever in the shadow of its successor..\n\nCrusader Kings is a rather “Grand” Strategy game indeed, it may be pretty old, but even in its age it still offers a good play through.\nOverall:\n\n+ Solid Campaign To Work Through\n+ Very In Depth\n+ Easy To Run\n+ Grand Strategy Classic\n\n- Steep Learning Curve\n- Often Confusing\n- Has Not Aged Well\n\nGood 7/10\n\nThat goes it for my short Crusader Kings Steam Review\n\nThanks,\n\nThe-Sentinel-Gamer","September 28, 2014","true","24.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Even though the game seems pretty complex, many of its mechanics don't work very well. For example, I tried to conquer some pagan tribes in the Eastern Europe, sent my armies there, but as I declared war on them, after some bigger battles, which they lost, they just kept trying to fight me with diminishing number of forces and even though I crushed them repeatedly, couldn't really defeat them. On top of that, they kept "spamming" peace negotiation proposals every few seconds and, as I was a vassal to the "German king" (I know there wasn't such a title in this era), he just kept accepting the proposals and all my sieges were repeatedly broken, even though they had 10 troops left against my armies of thousands. The funny thing is that in that situation, I could decline the peace proposal, but, only if I was FASTER than the German king when clicking on the popup - and then the siege wouldn't be interrupted!\n\nSo in the end, every few seconds I got a popup for a battle, a popup of the pagans offering to cease hostilities (which I had to click really fast or risk the German king accepting it) and several random popups for various events. Add to that the fact that armies have something called "attrition", which means that a number of your troops diminishes over time, depending on various factors - which sounds great and complex and all, but combined with the situation mentioned above, it's just... stupid. I could have probably solved that by picking a different faction, but it's still pretty lame.\n\nNo, this is definitely not complexity, more like poor game design.","July 27, 2014","false","5.5"," 31 of 62 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","31","62","0","2"

Games like this seem to confuse "difficult" with "cluster-♥♥♥♥".\n\nAs soon as you press play, the game goes full speed ahead without you. In order to stop this, you have to click this tiny banner which does not even look like a button. The game throws out notifications all over your screen before you even know what is going on, and even then it is difficult to ascertain what it is trying to convey. The UI is not even remotely intuitive. The AI makes decisions that make no sense at all. Controlling anything is totally unintuitive.\n\nThis game is perfect for people who like to feel superior to others because they spent the time fighting the design, rather than playing the game. You can actually lose before you even started getting into things and then lose over and over again after having your first ruler die because they could not produce offspring. There is nothing you can really do to control this besides going "please respond" to every ruler on the map when looking for a wife. Even then, you can screw yourself. Not like it matters since your ruler will start to gain vices for no explicit reason, impairing his or her ability to rule. Again, you have NO CONTROL over what happens.\n\nYou want to simulate the trait rolls in this game? (DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS YOU WILL DIE DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS) Get a jar of used medical syringes and some rusty nails you found on the side of a construction site. Smash them on the ground and roll around and see what kills you. It does not really matter, but it's an accurate depiction of what it is like being a character in this game. (DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS YOU IDIOT DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS)\n\nJust get CKII. There is much more to do and it's just as "difficult" without being as obtuse. You won't have to deal with the resolution issues either.\n\nStill, if you absolutely love these types of games, I suppose you can get this one.\n\nAlso, it's pronounced "DOMAIN", not "DEEMEENZEE".","November 29, 2013","true","1.5"," 12 of 32 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","12","32","0","0"

Secondly, the game seems to go on for much, much too long, even on high speed (those 10 hours I've played are almost entirely on the first game and I'm still probably not even half way theough).\n\nOh, and lastly, I still don't really know entirely what I'm doing or why i'm doing it because everything is just so poorly explained. Add this to the seemingly monumentual length of the game and you have something which I now just find boring and don't want to continue anymore.\n\nOf course it's perfectly possible that I'm mistaken in some of these criticisms but I just don't know because I wasn't given a tutorial and the manual was rather inadequate.\n\n","March 16, 2014","false","10.1"," 24 of 63 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","24","63","0","2"

I would also like to point out that the publisher of this game has a new game out called Crusader Kings 2, As it happens they were able to release about 20 different DLC packs for that game to nickel and dime you to death but are incapable of updating this game to work properly with a modern PC.\n\nOne word comes to mind here and it is "lazy". What else can you say about a game which lists it's specs as requiring an obsolete operating system such as XP? I would like to play this game but I can't in it's current state without putting myself at great inconvenience. I have a duel monitor Windows 7 setup and every time I want to play this game I have to disable one of the monitors to prevent the game from putting my main monitor out of range for me when I try running it. If you run it with a multiple monitor setup it'll send one of your monitors out of range forcing you to restart your PC just to regain your primary display. Another thing I would like to make note of is how the game seems to never fully install because each time you launch it from within Steam It'll popup a UAC warning due to the fact that it wants to update DirectX EVERY. FREAKING. TIME.\n\nI bought this game to demo Grand Strategy games in general because Crusader Kings 2 was on sale and I was interested in buying it, I consider the money I spent on this game wasted because I cannot enjoy it fully on my desktop. I hear good things about Crusader Kings 2 but will not buy it now as a matter of principle given the fact that the apathetic developers of this series care only about money and push incompatible garbage like this game on the public without so much as a warning on the store page.
