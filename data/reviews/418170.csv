The game only has about 10 tracks and you can only have up to 4 cars in your race. But wait. There's more. The loading screen's graphics just wants to make you barf. But most importantaly, it looks like a guy made it in 10 minutes and uploaded it to Steam. I played for only 1 minute and it was already the worst game I have ever played.","December 28, 2015","false","0.1"," 31 of 57 people (54%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","54","31","57","8","0"

Would be better for me as windowed at specific resolutions on a big screen than being forced to upscale.\n- Difficult controls from keyboard with on/off for speed and turning.\n- Doesn't remember settings on restart\n\nOverall a mostly positive first impression.","December 15, 2015","true","0.3"," 25 of 66 people (38%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","38","25","66","8","1"
