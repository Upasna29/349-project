Reminds me of my first gaming days surfing the web and finding things like flash games such as Warfair 1917 and 1944. Good tutorial and lots of campaigns. A very solid game with a good price tag for what you're getting. Almost a rarity these days with 60$ titles releasing with huge amounts of bugs.","March 1","true","2.9"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","37","46","0","0"

I chatted a bit with one of the devs online and wfound out this was not a straight port but a rework.  For 10 bucks, I figured what the heck.  I am very happy I gave it a shot.\n\nWhat it has:  A very well done UI, quite easy to understand and friendly.  Nice graphics.  When I started in the tutorial I was reminded of the classic Panzer/Allied General games.  The tutorials are very well done and teach you everything you need to know to play well.\n\nA ton of content comes with the game.  Over 9 separate campaigns, each with multiple missions.  3 levels of AI make the challenge customizable for all player levels.  If you are a wargames expert and want a human opponent, there is a 2 player hotseat mode with 10+ scenarios as well.\n\nThe game play is fast, clean and easy to understand.  Your units can move and attack (think soldiers and tanks firing on the move) wuth a reduction in their combat effectivness.  Cover and terrain are very important for protection and line of sight as the map is shrouded (fog of war).\n\nOverall impressions:  I really like this game!  I started it up and when I looked up, 2 hours had gone by and I was still having a great time.  One of the first games in a long time that I was disappointed when life interferred and I had to stop playing.\n\nDo yourself a favor, get this gem of a game.  I know the devs are working on a American Civil War game as well and I am really looking forward to that one as well.\n","March 3","true","6.1"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","21","26","0","2"

But yes it's an Ipad port so not overly complex.","March 1","true","1.0"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","0"

Personally glad more mobile games are being ported. It's limitations are acceptable to me, given the fact it was written for a phone, tablet, or other "lost-down-the-back-of-the-sofa" device.","May 2","true","60.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game was obviously never properly tested for Windows 7, because after downloading it from Steam, the game will not launch! Tech Support from Scotland where this game originates from is as useless as ♥♥♥♥ on a Haggas. The only feedback received from another sucker who purchased this app only mess was 'are you using two monitors?' Not worth 10 cents in it's current condition. Let alone 10 Dollars!","April 16","false","7.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","4"
