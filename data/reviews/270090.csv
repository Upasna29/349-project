Even with the low cost of entry and the fact that it is currently on sale for 20% off as a new release, N.P.P.D does little to innovate in a genre that has been inspired by a plethora of other indie games as of late.  The look and feel are straight out of the mid-to-late 80's, but the gameplay unfortunately doesn't live up to the expectations or the intuitive mechanics we've come to enjoy from other modern classics such as Retro City Rampage or Hotline Miami.  If you're feeling nostalgic then you'd be better off saving your money for one of those two titles rather than picking up N.P.P.D RUSH in it's current form.  The gameplay sounds interesting on paper, but is only interesting for brief periods of time and coffee break style playthrus.  In fact it's very hard to categorize or compare the gameplay when it feels like a combination of less complete versions of more popular games and arcade gameplay styles.\n\nThe lack of any leaderboards, steam acheivements, or trading cards is unfortunate because those things might give gamers extra incentive to return to the game.  The complete lack of an options menu and the fact that there is no gamepad or controller support is also very disappointing considering that these extra features should be seen as a fundamental inclusion for any and all Arcade style games, top-down shooters, and of course platformers, whether it's an independently developed game or not, and regardless that they are made for PC.  This is the year 2014 after all.\n\nHere are the pros and cons:\n\n-- The Good (or at least mediocre): --\n\n- Interesting neon graphic style.  Very flashy, much like the arcade games of yesteryear.\n- Oldschool gameplay, reminiscent of the old Arcade games, Amiga games, Commadore, and Apple games.\n- Keyboard and mouse controls are fairly responsive, while also barely forgiveable.\n- Gameplay *can* be fun, but only in short bursts.\n\n--  The Bad:  --\n\n- The graphics might be a hit or miss for some gamers.  You'll either appreciate the aesthetics or absolutely hate them.\n- The music isn't very memorable and can become quite repetitive and annoying after a short time.\n-  Extremely basic user interface.\n-  No options menu.  **No resolution changes, no windowed or fullscreen control, no volume control.**\n-  No controller support.  This is an absolute must for any and all arcade style games or platformers these days.\n-  Nostalgia can only get you so far.  I appreciate the effort, but the entertainment value here is limited.\n\n\nFor now I'd have to say pass this one up.  With a little luck, maybe N.P.P.D will have an update or two that will rectify it's problems and glaring omissions.  If you're in the mood for retro arcade style goodness then check out Retro City Rampage, Hotline Miami, Aqua Kitty, Love, Oniken, or Muri, all of which can be found here on Steam.  You'll get much more value for your dollar out of them.","February 13, 2014","false","3.6"," 124 of 169 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","124","169","0","0"

However, that's all it has going for it. The camera distance is a killer. You cant see very much at all, and too much of what is happening when you roll around on your "motorcycle" is off screen. The targeting is pretty simplistic, with a movable reticule. Sadly, this was also a poor choice I think. Better if you just fired ahead IMO. Also, the WASD controls feel a little out of place as well. I would much rather seen gamepad support for this.\nOverall, I feel this game had some potential, but the issues (and most notably the cameras) render this game virtually unplayable for me.\nStill, you can farm cards, and I suspect most people at this point got this as part of a bundle (I did), so no great loss from a financial standpoint, but man...it's really too bad the developers didnt think this one through a bit better.\n\np.s. There is a 5 minute mission timer, and as I found out when I was idling the game, it starts on the main menu, not in game, so every five minutes when you are farming, you will still get an annoying alarm signaling the end of game time as it were.","November 22, 2014","false","1.1"," 55 of 63 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","55","63","3","1"

Between the horrible pseudo-retro graphics and below-average run of the mill twin-stick shooting, this game is contender for one of the worst I've ever played. There were no positives to this game except that it had trading cards, and even then that was stiffled by the fact you have to play this game for around two hours to get them.\n\nI genuinely like video games and can find even the smallest smidge of entertainment in them, even the bad ones. I was unable to find any such entertainment here. The game is a chore to play and there is no real incentive to actually do so. No plot, no real motivation besides 'do that'. Now, 'do that' isn't such a bad thing in and of itself. Mario would still be just as good of a game if it had no plot due to its addictive gameplay and responsive controls. This game is no Mario.\n\nWith a game that has no real story beyond a few lines of text, you would expect the gameplay to be unique or interesting. This has neither of those things. You simply shoot at enemies that could only be described as something the designers doodled up in the allotted hour of time they were given before the game was shipped to release and save junkies. They're reminiscent of enemies from a bad flash game you could find on a website that hasn't been updated since the year 2000. While struggling to find out if that blue blob you're shooting at is actually meant to be something other than a blue blob, you're also struggling with the controls themselves while you try to save junkies left about the city.\n\nIn a Shoot 'Em Up styled game, the most important part of that game are the controls. Why in God's green Earth would you release a Shoot 'Em Up that has blocky controls? Why in God's green Earth would you release said Shoot 'Em Up with NO gamepad support? Why is this still a thing in the year 2014? I can only hope and imagine that the developers were unable to provide players with such amenities because they had run out of time within their one hour deadline to get the game finished. It's completely unacceptable in this day and age for these things to not be resolved or dealt with.\n\nOverall this game is rubish and that's putting it lightly. Most of whatever trivial amount of time they spent on developing this game went towards the graphics that are more cringe inducing than they are interesting to look at, and sadly that's probably the main selling point to anyone who's interested in purchasing a game like this. Skip this game, as it's not worth the time or money.","September 28, 2014","false","1.7"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","28","35","0","0"

My guess is that I probably got this in a bundle and activated it just for the cards. I know I certainly didn't activate it for the amazing gameplay. It gives you a very short description of the controls in a screen that you have to click past every time you die, but aside from that, it just tosses you into the game with no idea what's going on or what you're supposed to do.

RUSH//- The milk of Ultraviolet is a very, very weird game! It's mostly a top-down shooter of sorts, with some light rogue-like and bullet-hell elements. It's a game that you can pretty much beat in less than 10 minutes, but it may take a couple of hours to understand what's going on and be able to beat it.\n\nBasically, you're dying. You've been in some sort of accident, lost your limbs, and are now attached to a motorcycle, with guns for arms. Badass, huh? Everything has a decayed, drugged feel, in a good way. Your task is to collect girls for an unknown purpose (later revealed), and try to survive while you're at it.\n\nYou kill enemies that drop money, and you can use that money to upgrade, sell your organs (and be left bleeding out), buy girls, buy more time, etc. Have I mentioned it's a crazy game?\n\nContext\nAfter Uriel's Chasm, Rail Slave Games seems to have become the developers whose games people just get for very cheap, and then do joke reviews on. While there are many legitimate flaws in this game, it certainly does not deserve the way people look at it as.\n\nI played his other game yesterday, and while I recommended it for people who owned it, and wanted a completely crazy experience, I do not think it is a very good game, even at its core. The cryptic biblical theme didn't help either.\n\nWith this game, however, while it's full of huge flaws, design-wise, it's also something very unique at its core, and I actually enjoyed it! Think dark Hotline Miami, on steroids. This is pretty much that, although in a smaller scale.\n\nI've bought it for less than 40 cents, and it gives you 3 cards, which you can sell for 9 cents each, so half of the game pays for itself.\n\nPresentation\nAlike their other game, there are steam reviewers saying the game's  retro look is badly done and very ugly.\nWell, the ugliness is completely intentional, and it gives the game a very personal vibe, in my opinion. It's a weird mixture of glitch and cyberpunk. It's gritty and cheesy, but it definitely sets the tone and carries the experience almost by itself.\n\nMind, however, that the game has many faults when it comes to feedback, and part of it comes in visual form.\nThis is because you get blood on your screen when you kill enemies (the one introduced after release doesn't, due to a bug...). This would look like you're the one being damaged.\nHowever, when you're damaged, the screen gets blue, and can often pass unnoticed.\nIt's ... not good. You'll often die because you didn't realize how close you were to death. It's unfortunate...\n\nThematically, it's very cool looking!\n\nThe sound-effects aren't very high quality, but again, help to set the tone. Didn't find them very good at all, but hey...\nThe music is also a mixed bad. It's mostly an amateur industrial metal. It's very noisy and low-fi, and I'll definitely not listen to it on my own time. Yet, it adds a lot to the experience. Most people will find it completely awful at first listen... the whole game feels like that. But if you can put yourself in the right mindset, you'll find that it's a very cohesive experience, design-wise, and thus creates a great atmosphere to visit for a short while.\n\nInterface and Options-wise, it's pretty horrible. Besides, half of the things do not exactly work as intended. Your preferences always reset when you get to the menu (either by starting the game, or finishing a run), the timer starts counting on the menu rather than when you start a run, etc. Still, the most important option for me was the game's volume (no separate sliders either), and that could be changed at any time, by pressing "+" and "-", so that's fine.\nYou always have to click when the cursor is on "back" to go back. Many people, myself included, simply press "Esc" to go back, and that closes the game immediately. There isn't any sort of saving, so you may lose a few runs by mistake like that.\n\nMost of the dreadful first impression comes from this. The developer has said that he doesn't like making options menus and the like and wants to express himself. I can understand that, but the result is a game that seems to have be hammered together. And, for most people, it's definitely a big wall to their enjoyment, leading the the whole joke circle jerk around the developer.\n\nThe game didn't feature any menu, initially, but it was updated after release to have some options. It was appreciated, but it explains many of the bugs. The menu exists, but the game hasn't been changed to accomodate it...\n\nBottomline is, it's probably the game with the roughest edges I've played. The interfacing is absolutely awful, and the presentation very unpolished. Still, if you can get past that, you may enjoy yourself!\n\n\nStructure & Mechanics\nIn this game, you need to save 30 girls, spread through 5 floors. After that, a passage on the 5th floors opens up, leading you to the final Bossfight.\nIt's a simple twin-stick shooter. You move with WASD, and aim/shoot with the mouse. The menus are the same.\nI don't know why people mention the controls as being bad. I thought they were fairly good. Sure, it does not have gamepad support, but it's no the end of the world.\n\nPerhaps people didn't notice that you're on a motorcycle, so you move as in such. It felt pretty good, to me!\nBesides, your guns have a very high rate of fire, and make the enemies seems like butter, at times.\nThe camera is also very close to your character, which may hinder gameplay for most people. Honestly, I was waaay past that when I played this game. It's the kind of thing you can play for 10 minutes, be challenged, and then put it down.\n\nEach floor has a different configuration, and you'll have to learn their layout to plan accordingly. You have a time limit (which you can increase with money), so it's important to know where to go. The levels are also full of enemies, some of which have a very bullet-hellish pattern. There are only 3 enemy types, though.\n\nThere's a shop in the begining of the level, and it's also your "staircase" to change floor. In the shop, you can buy one weapon upgrade, time, girls, and then there are 2 things with a heavy penalty to them. One, is buying health, but losing time. The other, selling your organs, for a big amount of money. Time doesn't tick when you're in the shop. However, once you sell an organ, your health starts to decrease, as you're bleeding out.\nWhile the intention would be for the game to have a very subtle balance between what the player buys, it can be cheesed (haha, obviously!). While that may seem a bad thing (and yes, it is bad design), it opened up a speed-run competition on the Hub, where people are trying to cheese the game faster. It's amusing.\n\nWhen I first beat the game, I beat it normally, by using the shop only to buy the weapon and time. I explored the levels thoroughly, and collected the girls. It took me more than an hour to understand what was really going on, haha! After that, I cheesed the game, and half cheesed it a couple of more times. It was fun.\n\nThe last Boss is in a small screen, with bullet-hell patterns. It only has one phase, and there are situations where you can't avoid to take damage. Still, I never died against it, and I'm not particularly good at these games... The Boss fight is also independent on the rest of the game, so no need to worry about health or anything else.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe game is very, very imperfect, and really bad at times. However, if you manage to ignore that, and even the sub-par design, you'll be left with a very unique experience, and quite fun at its core, I've found! I won't play any more than these 2 hours, but it was almost free... Besides, if you're into getting into the highest scores, the game is quite fun to play with.\n\nFor the vibe alone, recommended!

A surreal, semi-8-bit top-down speed shooter with a heavy emphasis on your dodging and resource management skills. The only goal is to rescue 30 junkies in 5 minutes* and then take down club owning drug lord Ultra Violet, buuuuuuuut the game is... hectic. Surrealist overlays (the designers describe it as "glitchpunk") and overwhelming visuals turn it from a relatively simple game into an assault on the senses and I'll be honest? It adds to the charm.\n\nIt is a game you will probably have to play a few times to beat, and there likely won't be much replay value for you afterwards, but I'll be damned if it didn't accomplish its goal and tell a sick, fun story in the process. Good work from the team behind it.\n\n* You can extend your lifespan but it involves some tradeoffs.

On a whim I decided to boot this up. 3 attempts and 37 minutes later I'm staring at a credits screen wondering what the hell I've just experienced. This isn't a game that goes down easy. N.P.P.D. Rush is confusing, violent, aggressive, and unforgiving. Yet somehow I enjoyed it.\n\nThe plot is given to you when you boot up the game; Nauseous Pines (a city) has a drug epidemic (Nox) by nightclub owner Ultra Violet. You're a surviving Nox addict, now berift of your limbs, grafted to a police motorcycle equipped with twin guns. You go around rescuing other drug addicts, saving them and quickly (30 in 5 minutes).\n\nWASD and Left click, that's it. No remapping controls, no windowed / full screen, no resolution adjustment, brightness changes. What you get is toggling scan lines, toggling "chip fat" (makes things blurry if you do), volume control, and your Bike's color scheme (which is random and you won't see until you play).\n\nIf you adjust ANY options, and die or quit the game, you MUST redo them every time.\n\nActual gameplay is five small levels of twin stick arena shooter. You have HP, which the drug addicts you rescue restore (10 per), and a timer that counts down from 300. Enemies drop money, which you use in the store area (that also contains going up or down floors) to buy a variety of things.\n\nClock Makers adds 60 seconds of play time for $3,000\nGunsmith has a one-time gun upgrade for $5,000. (Worth it!)\nOrgan Traffic pays you $10,000 at the cost of losing 2HP / sec each time you do it.\nPimp sells you a drug addict girl for $5,000. (Never needed this)\nNightclub sells you 120 health for $1,000, but you lose 50 seconds.\nGraphics are super muddy and try to hit that retro aesthetic, gameplay is intense and you WILL need to retry (possibly many times), and the style really evokes that "Futuristic 80s" vibe really well. Or, it does when the camera doesn't leave you nauseous with the constant zooming every time you stop moving.\n\nThings become a bit better when you rescue all 30; as soon as #30 is picked up you no longer have to worry about the timer. The enemies are much the same throughout, and the targeting reticule that follows you will continually attempt to summon what essentially are the Gradius fire worm creatures. These things are nightmares, avoid like the plague or face intense health drain.\n\nUltraviolet loses points for lack of optimization, lack of options, the god-awful camera, no Steam overlay or windowed mode (that I could find). But it is fun, it's not honestly THAT hard (3 attempts in 37 minutes) since you just need to remember where the rescuees are and beeline it for them (buying the gun on the 1st stage helped a lot), and it has such a unique flavor that it'll leave you thinking about it after you finish playing it.\n\nSuch is the flavor of the milk of Ultraviolet.","November 13, 2015","true","2.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

The problem is you'll probably last about 20 seconds and then die...if you survive (by buying more health) then the game may force you to lose anyway.

It doesn't explain anything. What many will identify as negative aspects of the game, some will find to be perfect for the vibe the developers intended.\n\nThe game is confusing. The gameplay and core mechanics are not described, or taught to you through 'learning levels' like so many other titles. The teletype text and short 'scenes' don't give the player much more than nebulous hints, but encourage an imaginative player to read a great deal of the story between the lines. The crazy colour scheme, soundtrack and HUD make the game difficult to follow, and it will take you a number of playthroughs to figure out even the core mechanics.\n\nThe objectively great part of this game is the soundtrack. Fast paced, bumpin beats set the mood perfectly, and wouldn't be out of place at your next killer house party. Other than that, why was this game worthwhile to me?

RUSH" (I'm not typing the full title) has some major issues.\n\nOld/retro games had to work with hardware limitations, like the nunber of colours which could be displayed at once and per sprite, scanlines on the display hardware and so on, and this tended to lead to cleaner but more abstract display. Unfortunately that's not the case here.\n\nWhile the noisy display this may be the art style, its done terribly. What you get is a confusing mess which means you can't instantly tell enemies from the backgrounds. The scanlines don't help, either - they seem to be applied on the display when its being rendered, and then again (optionally this time) on the final result, leaving a terrible moiré pattern mess.\n\nAdd to this a camera which zooms out slowly when you move, but almost instantly snaps back to a close up (meaning you can't even see the thing you were shooting at any more), and the mouse movement being locked to the player, so you need to constantly make adjustments, and you have something which is unfortunately signficantly sub-par.\n\nNice concept, poor execution.","May 2, 2015","false","2.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

RUSH// - The milk of Ultra Violet is friggin' weird, man. Set in a hellish cyberpunk future, you play the dying, limbless head-and-torso of a Nox junkie, freshly amputated and installed into a police-issue battlemech and sent forth to rescue 30 unfortunate women from the industrial dystopia that is Nauseous Pines before your life support systems fail or you simply get shot to pieces by drugged-up mutants and murderous nuclear snipers. The setting alone was more than enough to get me interested, and the gameplay certainly sounded compelling, but the final product is a whole lot more unpersonable than I'd hoped.\n\nThe game consists of five levels, each of which is filled with monsters, a number of women, and an exit that takes you to the next floor and offers you a chance to shop for upgrades. Killing opponents along the way earns you coins, which you can spend to delay the inevitable onset of time death, upgrade your weaponry, or rent a hooker for a health boost. More dubious services available include selling your "excess" organs for cash or getting a Nox hit, greatly healing you but causing your perception of time to get slippery. While there aren't too many enemies to encounter, the levels are randomly generated, so each game layout is at least a suprise. Unfortunately, that's exactly what you don't need in this game.\n\nThe visuals are heavily glitched out, resembling an NES game undergoing severe and likely fatal errors. Each foe you kill smears the screen with an opaque haze of red; each injury you sustain stains the screen blue. Every encounter leaves you semi-blind and hoping for the best. Even worse, your field of vision is intentionally so short that you'll be blazing along at high speeds, only to crash into an opponent and take heavy damage. The reaction time needed to not get mangled is inhumanly fast, and since the game has a timer, you're not exactly willing to go forward cautiously. The interlevel shops certainly help somewhat, but money's a scarce commodity, and spending time killing every opponent you come across is two kinds of suicide. In the end it winds up being a manic, stressful, anxiety-laden experience, and the lack of any sort of unlockables or achievements leaves you feeling that your 30 or 40 agonizing deaths served no purpose. Admittedly, you'll get better with time, but the game is still NES-title unfair and actively tries to aggravate you into quitting. It's a neat little art project with some gorgeous visuals and an enticing knack for authentic old-school agony, but if you're looking for a game you'll actually want to beat, look somewhere else.","July 30, 2014","false","6.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Everything is reminiscent of a really gritty neo-punk style. It looks cool, but the style is its own downfall. Is simple really, the game is a basic twin stick shooter and from what I could play it seemed decent enough. Although thanks to its graphic style, the game constantly covers your screen in colors, be it that you killed an enemy or you got hit by something. Thanks to this alone the game constantly blinds you and hampers you which in return results in an unenjoyable experience.","August 8, 2014","false","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game looks cool, and is sort of fun to play. Just there are a few minor problems that make me not recommend this.\nI've tried my best to complete this game, but I must be doing something wrong. From what I understand is that you need to collect so many women to beat the game (forgot how many)... only problem is the entire game is based on a timer that constantly drains over time and when you get hit. Because of this, I can barely make it to level 2. I've even managed to clear the first level with no hits, killing all enemies and collecting all money and women, and still only have about 10 seconds left of time to play on level 2. Since this happens, I've been stuck playing the first level over and over and over and the game got boring super fast. *The screenshots on the store page only show Floor 1, and that's all you will see as well.\nThe graphics look neat, but dear god I hate the SDTV Lines effect that this game has, and wish I could disable it. I know it's supposed to mimic the old TV look, but I can't deal with those screen lines. The old TV lines always give me headaches and hurt my eyes after some time...\nThe actual fighting and driving work perfectly. It's easy to drive around fast and shoot everything and dodge everything just fine. I've had no problems with controls.\nWhat really bugs me is there is no options menu. Can't change audio, controls, graphics, etc.\n\nIf your a Steam Card Hunter like me, get this only when it's dirt cheap.

With that said, it's not with out it's flaws. There is a lack of features, as well as no controller support. As a twin stick, I feel controller support is quite important. There doesn't seem to be a huge degree in variety, as it's really just shooting a bunch of stuff, but luckily, shooting a bunch of stuff this game does well, and it is quite fun.\n\nI'm not 100% if it's worth the full asking price, as low as it is, but if you are intrigued it's not terrible, just not perfect. Otherwise, I would recommend keeping an eye for a good sale, as it is at the very least, worth a check out.\n\nPros:\n- Suitable sound track for the game's theme\n- Shooting dudes is fun\n- Challenging\n- Well themed\n\nCons:\n- Can be repetitive to some\n- Lack of features\n- No controller support\n- Lack of variety","August 17, 2014","true","1.4"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","12","23","0","0"

RUSH// blew the mind out of my head, removed my limbs, and tossed me into the hyper-real clusterf##k of patterns and surreal violence that is Nauseous Pines. Now, MHLK 2.0 is Back TO KILL MY BODY.\n\nMy first impression of RUSH was like taking a hit of:\nENTER THE VOID, ROBOCOP, NAKED LUNCH, VIDEODROME, AND/OR BRAZIL while playing a glitched out SEGA Death.\nIt was a thrilling, desperate, intensely stimulating, and sickening ride. The visuals, sexy, tiled, and multi-textured, made me feel like I was bolting through a cramped, neon and chippy glass tower of 198X excess. The parallax scrolling and layering effects gave off the weirdest sense of dimensional overwhelm. The details beg for careful observation and some kind of meaning, but there are urgent matters pulling you into the search for bodies. Memory strategies and knowledge are gained through your failures and experiments, and it all starts to make sense and click in the end. A tense pulling apart of the mind's pattern recognition software is ultimately required to reach and defeat Ultraviolet. The classic version can be found on Desura service for those that crave it's crazy charm.\n\nUPDATE IS LIKE SUPER HARD AWESOME MODE GAME:\nInstalling the new version makes RUSH a totally revamped and extremely arcade like experience. You go way faster, hear louder music and more of it, kill more, face a more coherent and solidified challenge, and easily access upgrade shops from the start of each floor. You get brand new level designs, new graphics, new enemies and game mechanics, new presentation of ideas, and a new level of challenge. If you were perhaps turned off by the charming and quirky but problematic roughness features in the previous version, you will be happy to see that there is now a standard fullscreen mode, intro, menu screen, options and effect settings. When you die, you can start again without repeating the intro text. The new RUSH is a like a hardcore challenge mode. While the pre-patch version seemed to focus more on the mood, aesthetics and weirdness, the updated game focuses on action, speed running, and a smooth bullet hell gameplay experience. There is far less clutter and confusion, and more raw violence. The added CRT monitor, fatchip, and scanline effects are cool, but unfortunately I had to disable them by running in windows xp compatibility mode for my old rig to play without lag (Try running in 256 Color mode for an OLD TIMEY DOS feeling :) Overall, I feel the two versions are almost different games.

While the style and sounds are good, the game has a timer in it, and a very short one at that, just like the really old arcade games from the 70's and early 80's which only gave each person a few minutes to play, no matter how good they were. I hated this back in the day and I still hate it now. Without that timer it would be an interesting game and might have some longevity to it. Death, however, comes quickly, especially when you are rushing around trying to earn enough money to extend the timer slightly.\n\nThis game isn't for everyone but will appeal to some. Just not me. I like to enjoy a game at my own pace and be rewarded for playing well, not rushed through just because it's "retro".

It seems like the entire development budget went into making it look like an Amiga game on a broken television and not a thought spent on actual gameplay, which is repetitive, shallow and buggy. The freakin' timer (which kills you when it runs out) counts down on the pre-load screen! You can Game Over before you even begin playing!\n\nIt's difficult to tell what is an actual hazard and what is merely part of the trippy background, and you don't seem to have any mercy invulnerability, so you can take a massive amount of damage in a short period of time when your screen gets "splattered" with pixels, which it constantly will. The camera itself barely lets you see ahead of you, too, so if you try going faster than a snail's pace, you're going to run into enemies or their projectiles. For some reason, you use the keyboard to navigate the menus but use the mouse to make selections; but cannot actually select things with it until you've moved the arrow with the keyboard! It's also inconsistent, letting you use the arrow keys in some parts and forcing you to use WASD in others, and of course, there's no key rebinding options, and hardly any options at all.\n\nThe music is the only part that seems to have any semblance of quality, but even that feels like it's "trying too hard", and the soundtrack isn't included so that kinda negates it, since you're still gonna need to actually play this awful game. It's not very expensive, but even for the little I paid for it (with a coupon), I feel like I was overcharged.

You either ride on a tron lightcycle or that was just a regular motorcylce and it was simply a trail of my blood. So the game starts you out by pretending you have a character select but the only thing you can select is your settings. You can turn the scanlines off and the distortion effects off, but you can't turn the fish-eye effect off and this is probably the worst effect to have permanently on. The other games flaw comes from that the fact that all the sprites and effects blend into each other and you have little no to no idea what is happening at such a high speed. Most rouge-likes do something to distinguish important things to the player, but this is where the game falls short.

For a game like this, sure.\nN.P.P.D. RUSH is a game I want to see a full blown RPG based on. The kind where you roll dice. The visuals, the rediculous...whatever is going on, everything about it screams for more fleshing out. The developers are really onto something very, very interesting. At the very least, some sort of story or description or SOMETHING about this world; this really, really screwed-up cyberpunk dystopia.\nGameplay matches the graphics matches everything. It is fast-paced and simple, and rewards you for prioritizing targets and MOVING. The random maps give it good replay value. Sometimes you will be scavenging for enemies and junkies, sometimes you will be overwhelmed and, if you're quick, rich. The ability to move about the five levels freely is a false positive; you're always asking yourself if you grabbed the last one at the last level you were at, and, having to go search for that final junkie is killer. Literally.\nEverything scales well on a CRT monitor; looks exactly as it should. I can't speak too much on the graphics because of my weird setup and the nature of the game. If you're still rocking a CRT, you're in for a retro treat. Flatscreen 16:9? Don't know; hopefully it scales okay.\nThis game is the price of a bag of candy, or a big box of Pop-Tarts. I can say that this is a much better value than either if you like twin-stick shooters. Or arcade games. Or if you ever had a Sega Genesis. Or if you're a person.","September 16, 2014","true","2.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

I was lost as the window of the game warped like an age old CRT monitor, as layers of pixels and painted on cars stopped me speeding away from natural and mechanic, brutally harmful enemies shooting lasers and pins and rolling thunder, the dialogue of characters that headed over 2 screens max told me who they were, who I was, what this world was within 5 easily lost minutes.\n\nPlay it, if you get as much fun out of this as I did you'll be playing again in future, it's more than a retro-kick back, it's more than an aesthetic...despite being all about the aesthetics and aural sensations.

I've warped the marketplace -sell organs/buy a good time via escort to up my diminishing health/buy a few more gameplay minutes from what's left of my organ-fund/get out and try to collect more addicts-, I've driven around every floor...I always die or JUST run out of time.\n\nIn that way NPPD Rush makes me recall legendary flight/trading sim Elite or its sequel Frontier, there's no winning without manipulating the game's mechanics in stores. It's simple in every element, but put together like two dozen basic melodies in hardcore pop-punk perfection, which is anything but simple.","October 23, 2014","true","1.6"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","13","26","0","0"

I have reviewed games before and I say "after fifteen minutes I can see this is one of the worst games ever" but this is honestly the first game I have ever played that within the first sixty seconds I could tell that this was one of the worst games I have ever played. I am a fair guy so I played for five more minutes and I can say with honesty and without hesitation that this is the worst game I have ever played. The menu consists of "login" and "config". You press mouse 1 to confirm and I am not even sure what to press to get back out of a menu. I was in the config menu to see if there were other resolution options than what they programmed the base game to be like: like you are playing on a old ♥♥♥ retro TV with a turn dial. A TV with the warped corners effect like a TV from the 1940's because back then they hadn't learned how to make the screen glass flat. Nope no res options. I pressed escape to go back like it is in 99.99% of games ever made and the escape key closed the game. And I mean no confirmation, the game just closed when I pressed escape lol. This is the game's gameplay: use WASD to move around and hold down mouse 1 the entire time to fire, in which your guy moves at breakneck speed making it hard to not get pummeled with gunfire, which does not matter anyway because I have seen Atari 2600 games with better gameplay I am not kidding. If they were going for a retro look or whatever it is, they missed the mark by five thousand miles. The graphics are not retro, not oldschool, not charming or ambitious, not even by Atari 2600 standards. They are just a badly garbled mess of what looks like someone drew this game blindfolded in microsoft paint then swallowed that and barfed it back up. I wish I were just trying to be funny but that is no exageration. This was not fun whatsoever, I am ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I even wasted 50 cents on it, 0/10. No, -90,000/10.

HOWEVER, if you ARE looking for a game that puts you right back into the 199X era shareware feel or know what a ZX Spectrum is, then you must try this out!\n\nThe developer has created a gaming experience which harkens back to an age where most of the games were brutally difficult and those of the weak of heart dare not tread. The game is best described as cyber-trash punk (or glitch punk), a style which is hard to pull off considering trash-punk, by nature, looks unfinished.\n\nThe game also does not hold you by the hand. You learn how to play from both failing and trying things out. If you fear failure, this game is not for you! (and frankly, neither are most games pre-2004). As you play more and begin to understand what is expected of you, you begin to delve deper into the world that RailSlaveGames has created for you, and you begin to love the experience even more.\n\nYou play as a Junkie yourself... salvaged from the streets. What was left of your mangled and torn body has been merged with a high-powered police vehicle and sent on a mission to recover others who are on the brink themselves. You might be horrified by what you've become, but you have no time for that. You just focus on your mission and all will be revealed.\n\nThe game consists of 5 floors each with their own badass music track. The key to enjoying this game is to understand that each of these floors can be explored in any order. Floors do not need to be cleared sequentially. In fact, the key to beating the game is to find your own paths to acquire the NOX Junkies, collect the cash and get out!\n\nBy the time you're good enough to finally challenge the boss, you're sucked in and digging every moment!\n\nThis game would fit right in at the Data East arcade featured in Robocop 2, a gritty reminder of exactly the type of world which resides just outside the video arena.\n\nStill not sold? Well, you can watch me play around 2 hours of the game and decide for yourself! You can even challenge my score if you think you're RUSH enough!                  See you on the other side, NOX Junkie!\n\nhttp://youtu.be/PjhJsa_RAi4?t=23m25s","September 12, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Is the game worth $4, no.... Worth a buck on sale, maybe.\n\nWhether this game is worth having depends on whether you like retro top-down twin stick shooters---you move using WASD and have 360 degree range of shooting using your mouse to direct endless stream of bullets.  The shooting goes off screen, so one of the basic strategies in this game is to shoot as much stuff as possible off screen, which requires keeping a bit of a mental of map of the area since you only see a screenful at any one time.  It does remind me of some old NES games, but has a different flavor, given the subject matter that is a bit dark.   Also to be honest, this game is little more than running around shooting and collecting things.  The story, as it is, is infinitely ignorable.\n\nGranted the game is not the latest greatest twinstick shooter, but unlike many of that genre, this is relatively easy to play for some mindless fun.   While this game has the tag of bullet hell, it does not really fall in that subgenre, since you can generally avoid being immersed in a screenful of bullets, which is typically not an option in a true bullet hell shooter.\n\nThe game lacks basic stuff like configuring options, and even quiting (use Q) is initially obvious, but looking past these minor shortcomings, this game can lead to a few hours of mild enjoyment for those that appreciate mindless twin stick shooters.","June 27, 2015","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I wonder what the developers were thinking. It reminds me of an old school Sega game back in the 80s. In fact, Contra (you can get it free over the Internet) is much better. Now THAT is an old school classic! This game, however, is a disgrace to video gaming. I would rather watch wet paint dry than to play this game for 10 minutes!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HackMyDickNerd/recommended/270090/","HackMyDickNerd","Hydration Master","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HackMyDickNerd/","119 products in account","The game looked good at a glance, and let me state it again so you don't get anything mixed up. The game looked good at a -GLANCE-, this game when played though is terrible. First off the storyline for the first mission is (or the game) is that a drug called nox is being sold by a nightclub called Ultraviolet (hence the name) and apperantly you have used the drug and your body was horribly recked, but they find your body and now are appointed as an officer or chief (it never really explains that) of the N.P.P.D RUSH and all your limbs are gone and they hooked you up to a motorcycle as a replacement. Now if your brain hasn't melted out of your ears let me congradulate you. So after the weird girl moaning techno music intro you are a given two selections, 1) play the game 2) config (spolier THE CONFIG SUCKS ♥♥♥♥). The config consists of three graphics/video settings and a volume adjuster, the three graphics differences are a different paint job, scaleness, and sharpness (which only have two different settings for each, decent and ♥♥♥♥). Figuring out that the config wasn't going to help I played the game which presented me with a screaming cop telling me, "Save da jumkies!" to summarize it up. So I get past that and the game... First off there is about a 30 second loop of a guitar solo for background music, secondly the field of view is short to NOTHING which makes it impossible to play this game because it is fast paced and if you can't see what is going to kill you from far away then you're screwed (this leads to spraying down hallways, trust me I know you will do this), and finally the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ JUNKIES LOOK LIKE PURPLE GOO, NOT MISSING THEIR LIMBS LIKE YOU (and why did they strap you to a motorcycle, and why are you being put on a police squad? I just don't understand...). Thinking I could pause the game to take in what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, I press esc but suprise suprise! IT QUITS THE GAME ENTIRELY (which makes the game harder because now you can't just pause it when you want to, you have to go to the shop all the way at the begining of the map. Same if you want to heal, buy new weapons, or GET EXTRA TIME IN THE GAME SO YOU CAN PLAY MORE so I don't see this running back and forth thing interfering with any of those at anytime). The game like I said looked good at a glance but the finished playable product is NOT at all. Stay far away from this and DON'T BUY IT.\n\n3/10 Far below mediocore or ameuteur\n\nEDIT AS OF 3/3/15\nI'm glad that they've changed the view it makes the game a bit more playable, but I dislike that the view moves out when moving and I think that it would be better if you could set the field of view. Another thing I'm glad that they've changed is the instant esc quit and made it so you could pause but have the choice to quit, but that brings up another problem. When trying to quit on the main menu, it won't work because the esc would bring up the option to quit and pause the game when playing but it won't when on the menu. One thing I forgot to touch up on this the soundtrack, out of everything this actually stands out. The music is good and fits in. (I really enjoy the music when in the elevator menu)\nRight now I would rate it a 4.5/10 Not that good, but just misses the mark.","February 14, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HackMyDickNerd/recommended/270090/","HackMyDickNerd","Hydration Master","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HackMyDickNerd/","119 products in account","The game looked good at a glance, and let me state it again so you don't get anything mixed up. The game looked good at a -GLANCE-, this game when played though is terrible. First off the storyline for the first mission is (or the game) is that a drug called nox is being sold by a nightclub called Ultraviolet (hence the name) and apperantly you have used the drug and your body was horribly recked, but they find your body and now are appointed as an officer or chief (it never really explains that) of the N.P.P.D RUSH and all your limbs are gone and they hooked you up to a motorcycle as a replacement. Now if your brain hasn't melted out of your ears let me congradulate you. So after the weird girl moaning techno music intro you are a given two selections, 1) play the game 2) config (spolier THE CONFIG SUCKS ♥♥♥♥). The config consists of three graphics/video settings and a volume adjuster, the three graphics differences are a different paint job, scaleness, and sharpness (which only have two different settings for each, decent and ♥♥♥♥). Figuring out that the config wasn't going to help I played the game which presented me with a screaming cop telling me, "Save da jumkies!" to summarize it up. So I get past that and the game... First off there is about a 30 second loop of a guitar solo for background music, secondly the field of view is short to NOTHING which makes it impossible to play this game because it is fast paced and if you can't see what is going to kill you from far away then you're screwed (this leads to spraying down hallways, trust me I know you will do this), and finally the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ JUNKIES LOOK LIKE PURPLE GOO, NOT MISSING THEIR LIMBS LIKE YOU (and why did they strap you to a motorcycle, and why are you being put on a police squad? I just don't understand...). Thinking I could pause the game to take in what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, I press esc but suprise suprise! IT QUITS THE GAME ENTIRELY (which makes the game harder because now you can't just pause it when you want to, you have to go to the shop all the way at the begining of the map. Same if you want to heal, buy new weapons, or GET EXTRA TIME IN THE GAME SO YOU CAN PLAY MORE so I don't see this running back and forth thing interfering with any of those at anytime). The game like I said looked good at a glance but the finished playable product is NOT at all. Stay far away from this and DON'T BUY IT.\n\n3/10 Far below mediocore or ameuteur\n\nEDIT AS OF 3/3/15\nI'm glad that they've changed the view it makes the game a bit more playable, but I dislike that the view moves out when moving and I think that it would be better if you could set the field of view. Another thing I'm glad that they've changed is the instant esc quit and made it so you could pause but have the choice to quit, but that brings up another problem. When trying to quit on the main menu, it won't work because the esc would bring up the option to quit and pause the game when playing but it won't when on the menu. One thing I forgot to touch up on this the soundtrack, out of everything this actually stands out. The music is good and fits in. (I really enjoy the music when in the elevator menu)\nRight now I would rate it a 4.5/10 Not that good, but just misses the mark.","February 14, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is a mess.\n\nControls are imprecise and irritating, you constantly hit things.\nThe camera stays zoomed way too war in unless you're moving at top speed, basically ensuring you can dodge nothing and can see nothing.
