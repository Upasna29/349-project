The movement system and gunplay in this game is genius and revolutionized the FPS genre when the game came out.  Skills learned in this game translate nicely into other competitive shooters like CS and Insurgency.  This game is unforgiving and lots of fun.  The brutal gameplay forces you to get better or die repeatedly.  When you have mastered the game the feeling of superiority is very satisfying and makes you a better player in all FPS games.

I don't like this version of Quake as much as I do the others. It doesn't feel as polished as the others. The online portion is mostly just bots killing each other. The online community is hard to find. I have played this quite a bit and there is just something missing. The online play is ridged and not as smooth as I would like. The game doesn't have a single player but it does have alot of Multiplayer maps and bots for you to kill. The sounds take away from what it should really sound like. It feels like a couple notches down from were it should be. I have enjoyed my playing of this game but not as much as previous Quake's. I suggest to get this if you have friends to play but if your getting it thinking there are alot of people online then you are going to be disappointed.","February 24, 2015","true","9.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/2350/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Quake 3 Team Arena is an Expansion Pack for Quake 3, coming out in 2000, one year later. It's supposed to buff up team modes of Quake 3, probably in order to compete with other games at that time in this area. Still multiplayer arena FPS, yep.\n\nNow, for technical side. Yep, same problems as Quake 3 on Steam.\nWidescreen is not supported by default but you can edit resolution and FOV in config like in Q3.\nSteam overlay conflicts with game and would result in graphical glitches by default. You have to disable "GL Extension" in game's system options. If you will encounter random crashes, then you should just disable Steam Community for this game.\nQuake 3 Arena and Team Arena can break each others saves. After trying Team Arena I found that my Quake 3 campaign progress and options were wiped out, so watch out.\n\nAs far multiplayer community, it's completely empty. If you go to server browser and filter it to Team Arena only servers, then you will see void, unlike original Q3.\n\nSo, what it leaves us with is single-player portion of a game. There is no more campaign with whatever progress feel, just a bunch of matches to choose to play. Pretty much Skirmish. You can either play duel against 4 new bots in 4 new maps, not much to say about it, like a bonus. Or you can play in small teams in team based modes, therea re four of them. All of them involve you getting into enemy base to score, so defence is important. Classic CTF, One flag one (grab middle flag and bring to enemy), The one where you have to destroy skull thing at enemy base and where you have to kill people and bring skull they may drop to enemy. All four use same set of maps.\n\nBots were improved too. At least because you can give commands individually. And because they behave better, you can relay on them not to be dumb running around cluelessly with machine gun. They feel improved in general.\n\nAnd well, when it comes to bots team matches in most FPS, there is a problem that player may feel like he can't impact battle overall. Whcih is important, as he is the only real player. Youw ill feel somewhat disconnect from teambots in this game too, but at least with usual team size being 3v3 or so you will feel that you can take it on yourself. Maps are designed for such team sizes too. You can also give orders individually, though I didn't feel like these will be useful. Some matches cases can be won just by ordering all bots to go after enemy base, seriously.\n\nIt also introduces new weapons, powerups and runes. New weapons aer your everyday proximity mines, Nailgun that is like shotgun but shoots slow nails and Chaingun. I feel that chaingun is too powerful, being hitscan and packing a punch.\n\nAs for usable-at-anytime powerups you got only two and they both are fun: Kamikaze that lets you blow yourself and enemies and push back teammates. Really good. And thing that makes you stop in one spot, even in air, creating a timed shield around you, while you are free to shoot around.\n\nAnd then game attempts calsses in a really strange way. You see, one team's side of arena there are four runes. Runes can be picked only by member of it's own side and give him bonuses until he dies. It means that only four members can be classed too. Oh well, maps aren't designed for more than 4 on each side or so. Everys ingle of these runes is powerful:\nGuard - Gets 200 health and 200 armor. Health slowly regenerates.\nScout - Double speed and double speed of fire. Can't pick armor though.\nDouble - Double damage.\nAmmo-Regen - Double fire speed and slowly regenerated ammo.\nIn all honesty, I don't like them. They don't really make you play differently, it doesn't feel like each class requries it's own approach. More like, each class is powerful in their own way. But overall good, no big weaknesses. And well, some may get too powerful at times, it feels.\nI mean, if Ammo-Regen gets Chaingun, making already powerful hitscan shoot two times faster, it will not be pretty.\n\nAnd well. I can't really recommend this game. It feels more like a mod, I think that it was seen as redutant even when it was released. There is no online part due to lack of community and it's not much fun with bots either, having no campaign to progress too, sadly. Not sure of overall balance either. You can skip it.","August 9, 2015","false","1.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/N64Lain/recommended/2350/","N64Lain","N64Lain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/N64Lain/","58 products in account","I have played Quake III Arena for a very long time. When I was a kid, I enjoyed it to death. Then I had found that there was a Team Arena expansion pack. Since I was really obsessed with the Quake franchise as a whole, I immediately flipped out and needed this in my Quake library. Unfortunately, I wouldn't get to play this for a long while. Like..."when I bought this on Steam" long while. So as a very curious Quake fan, I checked it out.\n\nOkay so IF you don't know what Quake III Arena is, it's a fast-paced shooter that has a huge following and great multiplayer. I wrote a review on here so if you want more details just go ahead and check that out. As for Team Arena, it's all in the name. It's literally an expansion that revolves around teamplay. Team Arena adds some new maps and some new weapons. It's pretty cool.\n\nOne big addition to the game that I really like is the team communication. Yes it was in Quake III Arena, but the problem with that was the fact that it was all text and if you didn't look up in time, you wouldn't be able to see it. With Team Arena, however, when you used a team order, your character would speak. THAT is the big reason I am recommending this. It is super useful for team games like CTF.\n\nSo I already said that I recommend it, but if it was still 1999 and Steam hadn't existed yet, I'd say I WOULDN'T recommend it. There really isn't enough new things to make this a real expansion. The weapons aren't even added to Quake III, so they're pointless. The new maps aren't added to Quake III, so they're pointless. And even though the new communication tool is nice, nobody really plays this game enough for even that to be worth it.\n\nBut thankfully, id Software must have realized this since now EVERY copy of Quake III Arena seems to come with Team Arena, so it's a nice bonus for all us Quake fans.
