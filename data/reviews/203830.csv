The art is so beautiful and vivid that it is as if I am playing a point and click game on a canvas that develops fantastically as the story progresses that it belongs in a museum.\n\nNot only is the art which masterfully changes from cheerful to dark with impeccable precision a reason to pick up this game but also the soundtrack (violins, angelic chorus, harps, guitars and a variety of other musical instruments) and voice acting are spot on with precision accuracy only seen in the military (May only apply to one branch).\nMost importantly, the puzzles (as expected of a Daedalic game) range from "just right" to "just stupid hard" with a rewarding sense of feeling unreplicable by other games (that is of course, it is a Daedalic game).\n\nThe Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav has some rpg elements in the form of dialogues but the consequences of your decisions are immediate and are in no way long term. But, being that it is, it definitely renders a second and even a third play through.\n\nI would like to extend this review to several pages length but I want to get back to playing the game. :)","February 3, 2014","true","9.7"," 61 of 68 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","61","68","0","2"

The game started straight away, a blessing after experiencing major compatibility issues with Daedelic's The Whispered World, and soon I was in game, launching into a somewhat abrupt beginning. Suddenly, the game stopped, seemingly frozen, before launching into dialogue, followed by the same thing EVERY TIME I spoke to someone. Now, I don't have an amazing computer, but I can handle fully 3D games just fine, no hangs. So I went to the options menu, turned everything down to low and it WAS WORSE! After some forum hunting I finally found out that TDE:COS needs to run in native color depth. So, I went to the configuration tool, changed it to 32-bit (from the lowest option, 16-bit) and, lo and behold, a fun game began to emerge.\n\nI will say, that this was the most frustrating experience that I had with this game. The puzzles were fairly logical throughout the first half, with only a few leaps in logic towards the end, where some of the physics are more maleable. The dialogue ranges from stilted to quite engaging. The over-arching storyline has enough going on that I was fairly invested, though it did not bring much novelty. However, shortly after I worked through the aforementioned flaws, I began to really, REALLY, enjoy myself. The visuals are very effective and there is an ambience throughout the game that plucked at my fond memories of The Longest Journey.\n\nYes, this game is flawed. Yes, the graphics cause delays and hangs. However, once you look past that, there is a really great game here (anyone remember the flawed, but fabulous, Soulbringer?). Well worth a budget price.\n\nPros: Beautiful. Enjoyable puzzles. Fairly engaging story. Some of the voice acting. Solid musical score.\n\nCons: Running it. Some of the voice acting. A few of the later puzzles.\n\n3.5 out of 5 Stars/Thumbs/Turnips","November 25, 2013","true","9.7"," 74 of 92 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","74","92","0","0"

K. Chesterton, quoted by Neil Gaiman, Coraline\n\nI only knew The Dark Eye series as a classic German pen and paper RPG until this point. After some research, I discovered that the realm of Aventuria has been turned into several cool pc games including Realms of Arkania and Drakensang RPG series respectively. But I've never dared to expect an adventure game that takes place in a FRP universe! It has been a satisfying change of pace for a fantasy lover such as myself: enjoying the contents of fantasy without venturing into battle.\n\nOur storyline takes place in humble beginnings, with Geron, the novice birdcatcher of the local ranger Gwinnling who lives in the silent medieval town of Andergast. Geron is considered to be cursed by the town populace, both disliked and feared with heavy prejudice due to an old prophet's dying words: "you will bring great disaster to Angergast!" Geron's unpleasant life takes an interesting turn though, when he is given the opportunity to get rid of the crows infesting castle's quarters. As he tries to attend this opportunity carefully, he meets Nuri, a fairy that will change his so far predictable life - and fate, forever...\n\nI'll try and put my experience on the table shortly: I loved every single moment of this game! Characters are original, the narration is exquisite, and the story is incredibly well-weaved! On a fair notice, the art works are singularly amazing enough to buy this game! It gave me the thrill of old adventure classics like Syberia or The Longest Journey. I found myself wondering the next bold move of our heroes in every pace, so I played the game in one single night!\n\nPuzzles vary between 'the logically expected' and 'the brink of insanity', which sets a tone for every single environment by itself. The context of the game consists of the marriage of two separate themes: the dreamlike, abstract nature of fantasy and the heavy, forlorn quest for philosophy comes together to portray the world of Aventuria, a world worthy of getting to know surely.\n\nIf you consider yourself to be an adventure game player, please take note that this game - alongside its sequel, Memoria - are modern classics to the genre. You will not be disappointed!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","May 26, 2015","true","14.4"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","32","35","0","2"

This time I wanted to do it all alone and with no help at all. I did also remove any options for hints/highlighter, and played it in hard mode. Very wise choice!\n\nThe game got an interesting, good history and the way I played it, it got even more interesting, but also more frustrating too. As I went through the game, trying to play it as logical as possible, I often ended up in dead ends. I decided to quit the game and think about it a while and continue later.

To whom? To anyone who appreciates art. This is several paintings in interactive form. Not for those who just want to shoot stuff.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\n-As an introduction to Memoria, the sequel. You'll get to know the characters, and get the references in Memoria.\n-Clever puzzles. Some are perfectly logical and relatively easy, while others defy logic (faerie realm) or are just too convoluted. Walkthrough will be needed. Sometimes its just a tiny little detail that eludes you (a thing that had to be broken). They are, however, still worthwhile and enjoyable.\n-Good story! Its a nice adventure to have, meeting colorful characters, discovering many things, traveling to strange places and ultimately saving your hometown. Reminds me of the Chronicles of Narnia.\n-Unique. Like its sequel, there is no other game quite like this out there.\n-The visuals. The artists did an amazing job. While the puzzles in the faerie world are impossible to understand, the surreal art is wonderful.\n\nIs anything bad?\n-The lipsynching is broken. They fixed this in the sequel.\n-The music is lacking or non-existant in many locations. They also fixed this in the sequel I believe.\n-Some puzzles defy logic and may require a walkthrough for most to solve. They are not kidding when they give you ''impossible'' challenges. A hint system, such as in Machinarium, would of been appreciated.\n-Animations are crude, often making the game stall for a moment, disrupting the immersion.\n-Severak voice actors can be pretty annoying, especially the talking crow. Also, get used to almost every character hating your guts (its linked to the story though). The main town, Andergast, is pretty depressing (its pretty small too).\n-Pretty short, especially if you use a walkthrough. It might take you a while to figure out the puzzles though. I personnaly gave up on that to breeze through and see the artwork!\n\nCan't really give this a rating.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiaakuma/recommended/203830/","shiaakuma","shiaakuma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiaakuma/","696 products in account","This game is well above average for the point-and-click genre of games.  It, like the sequel, weaves a beautiful story with beautiful artwork and music, and is well worth picking up ("Memoria" is the sequel and is also available on Steam).  Like all of this genre, there are some things to figure out which aren't necessarily intuitive, which can be frustrating.  This is no worse than any similar game, however, and didn't detract from my enjoyment of the game.\n\nThe interface and inventory are very easy to use, which is much appreciated in a land of complicated inventory management and skill systems and perplexing (at best) UIs.  For this genre, less is more in terms of making a player jump through hoops to work the interface.  This game does just fine at that.\n\nI've heard others say that the story isn't anything unique, but as I've never run into a story quite like this before, I'll politely disagree.  There are some of the usual fantasy game tropes, but the overall story felt brand new to me.  At least personally, I felt it was a beautiful story with some parts that were heartbreaking (caveat: I am a softie, so I might be more emotionally invested in the story than some are!).\n\nThe characters were all nicely handled; I especially loved Nuri's simple naivete, which the writers made work nicely by not confusing simplicity with stupidity.  She is not stupid, even when her innocence about the "human" world gets her into trouble, and even when her inclination towards trusting everyone works against her.  "Your humans are angry with me, Geron!" she says after opening the cages of a town's entire animal population.  Her bafflement is endearing.\n\nThe artistry of the scenery and backgrounds is what really impressed me through both of my plays through.  The attention to detail and sheer beauty of some of the backdrop scenes really showed hard work on the part of the illustrators, and I respect that.  I have some screenshots uploaded from this game just because there were parts I went full-on tourist with the camera.\n\nTL;DR: one of my very favorite games of the genre, beautifully done in terms of character, art, and music, and well worth picking up, along with the sequel, Memoria.","June 6, 2015","true","14.0"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","1"

This clogs up your inventory.\n\nSummary : The Dark Eye : Chains of Satinav is an underrated point and click adventure game. The game is quickly forgettable, but to those enjoying a dark fantasy world the story and lore of this world will stay with you.","March 17, 2014","true","10.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","1"

What does that say about this game? Not too much....I started this on the heels of playing a couple other point and clicks such as Primordia and realized that I wasn't ready to commit the time to it at that point. Recently, I started really craving a good point and click tough, so I came back to the game, and I am glad I did.\n\nSet in the Dark Eye universe (which many other games such as the Drakensangs, Blackguards also hail), gives it a sort of muted, middle ages with mysticism feel to it, which held true in this game. It's a really interesting setting in my opinion. You play as Geron, a bird catchers apprentice whose master is slain for his participation in the burning of an evil prophet 13 years prior to the events of the game, and his knowledge of the presumed dead prophets plans to destroy the world as we (they) know it. This is actually not dissimilar to the Blackguards story line actually. Anyway, you end up meeting and falling in love with a beautiful faerie and embark on an adventure to save the world, even though you really don't know how. The story finishes with room for a sequel, but with enough resolution to not require it, which was a nice way to handle it.\n\nSo, this is a point and click adventure. How does it stack up? I felt it was pretty good overall. There were a couple frustratingly difficult puzzles (most notably in the faerie realm, for me at least) and a few super simple puzzles, but most were just right: they required some thought and trial and error, but not to the point of frustration or leaving you feeling bored. I thought it did what it intended overall, and was pretty well par for the Daedalic course. It didnt really stray from their adventure formula, but managed to stay interesting the whole way through.\n\nAll told, I would give it 7 out of 10.

There is a lot of content hear for you to explore and the story is a little weak at times, but overall it has a solid amount of challenging puzzles and interesting environments for you to interact with.\n\nThe reason I rated it down at first and my continuing problems with it are that the puzzles often have an element to them that requires you to pixel hunt the screens for quite some time to find them or use the hint feature (essentially cheating for a player who plays these kinds of games a lot).  One or two is fine, but the consistency of the issue left a bad taste in my mouth.  The other issue I had was that the main characters were very unlikable to me.  Especially the protagonist.  While a bit of negativity and "anti-hero" character can lend some authenticity to an otherwise cardboard cutout, he was downright miserable and his choices that I could not control left me with little sympathy for him or connection to him.\n\nThe reason I have redone this review is that, fundamentally, this was a good game marred with exactly the kind of things that can ruin a game for me.  However, they are MY buttons and after stepping back a bit it is clear that they were really not enough for a bad recommendation.\n","August 16, 2014","true","20.0"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

It's not an horrible game, it's actually quite well done, it's just isn't good enough for me to recommend and I will tell you why.\n\nIt's dull.\n\nThe story in itself is ok, if a little weird, maybe because of the large amount of lore behind it which the game barely manage to convey. The characters are rather weak, the main character especially who in my opinion is very generic and boring, a sin he shares with many other characters in the game.\n\nThe art is well done, with hand drawn backgrounds , but the colouring seemed a bit grey and forlorn for my tastes. The atmosphere in the game is ... weird. At first sight the cartoony look of the scenes and characters with the fairy magic and classic poor peasant boy making it in a knight world is almost Walt Disney-ish. But it's a lot darker, people get maimed and killed in horrible ways one moment, then the main character make a lighthearted joke the next.\n\nThe game doesn't seem to make it's mind wether it want to be nice and cartoony or dark and repressive and it's rather confusing. Some gothic games manage to handle those two mindsets well enough but in the Dark eye, it's more of a mess, it comes out as unfunny and uncaring. .\n\nThe puzzles themselves are pretty good, although not revolutionnary, the break\fix abilities the main characters has on object is interesting . Technically nothing much to say, although the graphics seem to be a bit slow especially in the cutscenes, nothing dealbreaking, but a slight annoyance.\n\nI still played through the whole game, as a whole it's mediocre but It's definively ok , and if you're desperate for an adventure game and it's on sale, go for it.

It all started a while ago when I saw how amazing the game looked, and that was all I needed to buy it. The first few times I tried it, I just couldn't shake feeling that this beautiful game was dull. So, I put it away. Some time later, I played Blackguards, a strategy RPG which takes place in the Dark Eye universe. To my surprise (strategy is not my usual forte'), I loved it! With the knowledge of how exciting Adventuria could be, I was ready to take another stab at The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav. All I can say is.....well a lot.\nFirst, I want to deal with the story. Don't worry I won't give any of it away, since it would take too long. Suffice it to say, the game starts very calmly and yes maybe even a little boring. However when Geron the birdcatcher meets Nuri, things quickly change, changing the story into a dark, serious, and sometimes playful adventure. The lore in this game is very well done, for a point&click. Things we take for granted in fairy tale/ fantasy worlds are not always what they seem in this game. For example,  Nuri is a fairy who finds herself in the human world. She is determined not to go back to her fairy kingdom . Thats a plot point that I found to be unique, and opens up a lot of questions. I really enjoyed the story, which is huge really.\nWell to enjoy the story, you have to like the characters, and I loved them. Geron, admittedly, is a character we have all seen before. He is the social outcast who is labeled by superstitious, small minded people and it plagues him wherever he goes. He is always trying to prove that he is not out to destroy the kingdom. Even though it's a fimiliar character type, I liked Geron. The English voice actor I believe did a good job portraying the struggle that Geron has, throughout the game. Then there is Nuri...again we have seen her before. A fairy (yeah fairies don't need wings in this game) who is excited about the human world and wants to see everything with Geron. Not an original character concept, but Nuri is so genuine, innocent, and loving that you won't care. The relationship between Geron and Nuri is genuine. Honestly, if the chemistry between these two aren't felt, then the game fails.\nDo I even have to go into how this game looks? It's gorgeous, unique, and the best 2D hand drawn game I've seen. Period. If all P&C fantasy games were Disney movies, this is the Lord of the Rings/Willow version of a P&C fantasy game. The look and sounds (gorgeous soundtrack) of this game gives it that epic, big, serious, vibe that I've never seen before. But then again, I haven't played Memoria yet....\nNow the game mechanics. Yes it works like most modern day P&C's. You all know how to use a mouse. Geron and Nuri use minor magic spells in order to solve puzzles sometimes, which I found to be fresh. There are times, when Geron has conversations with Nuri that will change how she sees him, but it doesn't do anything to change the overrall ending. The puzzles are a mixed bag of fairly easy to having to sit down and think. I would probably not suggest this game to a new P&C adventurer, although there are some things in the game to help. There is a button you can push to see all the objects you can interact with, therefore cutting scanning the screen. Some of the puzzles near the end are hard, HOWEVER the game does tell you everything you need to know in order to solve it. Depending on the person, this could take some thought. There were times I used a walkthrough, but that was mainly because I was eager to continue the story.\nOverrall, this was a wonderful experience. I know I will be playing this again to pick up the missed achievements. Also, I will come back to revisit characters I enjoyed and a world that I wish I could access through my backyard.\n\nUPDATE:  After this review, I played through Memoria.

Loved "Kings quest" and "space quest" as a kid, loved "to the moon" more recently. This is a review for people looking at the sale, but are only moderate point and click fans.\n\nFIrst off, the game's visual 2D backgrounds look stunning. thats the first and main thing you'll notice. It looks like they used 2D backgounds with 3D avatars on top for the characters. The artwork team was very good, and original in its design. The only qualm I have visually is sometimes the avatars are choppy and the speaking narratives sometimes aren't synced very well, ie: their mouth simply justs moves as the voice actor voices the lines. Very distracting at best, and story breaking at its worst.\n\nThe story is very good, which is why point and click games shine. Geron (Protagonist) comes off as a bit whiney, but he's fairly lovable by the end of the story. He kinda reminds me of an emo peasant a little bit, but he's alright. Nuri (supporting character, and love intrest??) is very naive, but is kind of adorable, and is an excellent contrast to Geron. Without Nuri, Geron would have been unbearable, but her cheeriness brings the development along well, and can also be a source of comedy relief at times.\n\nThere are many difficult puzzles!!! This is where the amatuer point and click fan should be aware! I had my phone open almost constantly with a guide while playing because I hate being stuck for more than five minutes (hey thats just the world we live in) there were a few times I used the guide and scratched my head saying "Who the hell would get that without help!?" So if you do decide to buy and play, its okay to use a guide and still be a hardcore gamer! I've beat portal, dark sould 1, and 2 and demon souls, etc. If you listen and talk to people while exploring everything you'll mostly be okay, its when you have 25 items in your inventory that things get tricky as some tasks require 6-10 items in a proper sequence to do properly :( not difficult guys, just punishing. Difficult games are fun, not punishing...\n\nBut I digress, the biggest dissapointment comes at the end, I won't spoil it but its kinda frustrating to get no closure from a ten hour game, like literally no dialogue is spoken by the main characters after the antagonist is defeated.\n\nWorth it for the casual gamer, but not perfect!","November 20, 2014","true","7.3"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

Although I am not new to the point-and-click genre, I've spent about 20+ years neglecting it while playing other genres of games, and haven't played point-and-click adventure games extensively since freeware titles on DOS systems back in the early '90s. This game was the first game of the genre I've beaten since then, so take that as you wish to.\n\nThere are two difficulty settings for the game, and after you choose one, it starts right off introducing you to the main character, Geron. Geron is a bird catcher by trade, and you quickly learn that he is mostly unliked due to the bad luck that always seems to follow him. There are crows that begin to settle in Geron's home village, Andergast, and with the crows come terrible dreams that plague its residents. There is talk among the populace that this is no coincidence, and that a man they once thought was banished is making a comeback. Adventure ensues as your character gets caught up in the drama.\n\nThe game, as mentioned earlier, is beautiful. It's a joy to wander through this land, screen by screen, and the varied nature of the art does make it feel like you are truly on an adventure. The puzzles range from "duh" to "I need a walkthrough," and I did find that there were a few where after I'd solve them, I'd look back on the resolution and still not understand why what I did worked. It definitely fell victim a few times to the same thing many in the genre do, of having solutions that don't quite make practical sense. For the most part, however, the puzzles make logical sense. The characters, particularly Geron and his eventual sidekick, Nuri, have personalities that play off each other well. However, I did find Nuri to be pretty annoying during a few parts of the game. She's extraordinarily gullible and daft, and sometimes her decisions lead to chapters of Geron trying to fix her mistakes. To make matters worse, she has a habit of laughing at him, which felt condescending toward Geron, especially since his character is the one to solve the majority of the game. Story-wise, I enjoyed the world and its lore, however, the relationship between the two main characters seems more forced than anything (with Geron feeling he needs to protect Nuri no matter the costs, despite the fact that they're strangers in the beginning). So while the story was intriguing, the loyalty our main character has to it was unbelievable at times.\n\nThe gameplay works as expected of the genre, and there were a few parts of the game where the point-and-click gameplay is incorporated into a type of cutscene, which was pretty unique to me. There were sometimes more than one solution to a puzzle, and at times your actions (or lack thereof) could change the story in subtle ways, earning you an achievement for one decision or another. Speaking of achievements, for those who care, you will have to beat the game at least twice (once on each difficulty) to earn them all, and a walkthrough is necessary for some. For example, there's an achievement for using a certain spell 50 times, and without seeing that mentioned in the walkthrough, I wouldn't have known it (the achievements aren't very clear in how you can earn them) and I also wouldn't have gotten it (you won't normally use the spell 50 times in a playthrough, and maybe not even in two). Many achievements simply will not be earned unless you know beforehand about them and where in the game you can earn them, and it was a little odd that such a decision was implemented in this game.\n\nOverall, The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav was a fun romp through a new fantasy universe, and makes me happy that I picked up the Dark Eye Armageddon Bundle back during the summer sale, as I have more to experience. It truly did make me feel like I was on an adventure, which is what I missed about this genre. However, it does have its flaws, and falls victim to some of the tropes point-and-click games are known for. Considering all of its points, I'm giving the game a 7/10. It is truly above average, and I'd suggest this game to both fans of point-and-clicks and gamers who'd like an introduction to the genre.","September 19, 2015","true","12.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/recommended/203830/","Rhykevance","Sharisad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/","1008 products in account","A beautiful adventure.\n\nThe strongest elements to me are the gorgeous art, nice music and great voice acting. Nuri and Geron in particular are two wonderful characters. Their voice actors sound so nice, soothing, believable and powerful. They can be cute, funny, heartwearming, sad. It's just a joy listening to them or to be there to witness and kinda share their pain. I don't know if I had ever heard emotions projected so well only through voice between two characters. I'd love to hear them in a third The Dark Eye game, and I think it must be these two doing it close together because I am hearing them in another game, the "Game of Thrones" RPG, in more isolated roles but they just won't strike me there as much. Perhaps it's their skills and the script working magic here in combination - it looks like they were given a nice amount of freedom, or at the very least it sounds as if they were wholeheartedly enjoying their roles.\n\nThe puzzling is less diverse than in Memoria (= the sequel) but still fine in it's own, traditional right as far as I can tell. I'd say it's of the easier (not easiest, but average) kind as you won't always have dozens of items to handle and the solutions aren't as absurd as they can be for example in Deponia. You can have points of interest in the world highlighted by the press of a button, and there is a combination helper that has item labels showing up in either blue or white color depending on whether you can still do something with them or not. This mechanic was dropped in Memoria it seems, maybe because randomly using the little to average numbers of items you have works just quicker than memorizing this color coding.\n\nThe only flaws of this game I came to notice are some technical hiccups; between actions there can be very brief "freezes" which didn't annoy me but which I heard one or another player complain about on the hub. This is nothing to lament over too much I believe though because there are no real-time action scenes that would require you to have everything work totally fluently.\n\nWhich is a bit unfortunate is that, like in Memoria, audio and text will not always align, at least not when playing in English. Some lines in certain scenes may appear in text or audio which simply don't belong there but to previous ones, or one or another sentence wasn't translated properly from German (the native language of the devs) to English. This doesn't happen brutally often, but it does on some occasions and you'll notice.\n\nWhat works better here than in Memoria is the the journey/adventure log, which is a relatively simply book with a short text what had happened and what you are about to do, roughly, with a world map indicating where you are (roughly as well - not that it would matter much because the game has you go through specific locations, you won't be travelling around the world by your own merit).\n\nAlso, the ending felt a little rushed; beautiful and fitting in some ways, but I was surprised it came as quickly as it did, and there isn't much of an epilogue either, which would have left me "unsaturated" if not for the fact that there is already a sequel which properly continues and somewhat ends what was started in Chains of Satinav.","July 13, 2015","true","65.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The game set in an almost legendary fantasy setting of "Dark Eye" (in some countries it's even more popular than 'Dungeons&Dragons' !), and above all an adventure, not RPG one, to me seemed like a guaranteed success.\n\nDespite minor flaws like surprisingly low frame rate, and a few resolution problems, I've started the story, and meet our Hero for the first time. In ‘Chains of Satinav’ we take up a role of Geron, a young bird-catcher who bravely stands against dark forces threatening his home town of Andergast. The narrative we follow is a solid piece of work, with some surprising plot twists and believable, memorable characters. Not only the fully voiced dialogues, so important in adventure games, but also the world itself are designed with a great care for details making the whole journey a pleasant and memorable experience.\n\nThe riddles that fill the world of 'TDE: Chains of Satinav' are pretty good, some of them really witty, but overall not hard enough to discourage You from finishing the game. A huge plus is the fact, that they’re all pretty much logical chains of actions, which prevents typical adventure-game puzzle rage. An unique addition to the common point and click mechanics are two special 'talents' that Geron can use to his aid. Our particular bird-catcher is capable of breaking, and later even fixing some fragile objects, which allows him to solve some of the harder puzzles.\n\n“TDE: Chains of Satinav” is a great adventure game, with beautifully drawn backgrounds and captivating story. The puzzles although not that hard, may provide just enough challenge to prevent You from blitzing through the game. Another great feature is an atmospheric music, perfectly accompanying Geron's adventures and enriching the whole experience.\n\nPros:\n-	A very good narrative with believable characters.\n-	Set in a vast fantasy setting of ‘Dark Eye’\n-	Need at least two play troughs to get all mutually exclusive achievements.\n-	Unique atmosphere created by hand-drawn stills and amazing music.\n-	Sequel already in store (check ‘Memoria’)\n\nCons:\n-	Surprisingly low Frame Rate.\n-	Some common problems reported with game freezeing and resolution.\n-	Puzzles are not that much of a challenge.","December 24, 2013","true","8.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Even though I´m not familiar with the Dark Eye World I found it an interesting setting. The story line is by no means original but the narrative still feels solid and keeps you as a player interested in seeing how the story will play out.\n\nAs other reviewers have done I will also recommend playing the game on hard difficulty since the game does become a bit to easy when played on easy with the help modes enabled. The main use I see for the easy difficulty is for those who wishes to play the game more like a visual novel, since the story and narrative is good this is a viable option. I found most of the puzzles to make sense and only the Fairy World may be considered a bit out of the ordinary in that department. The inclusion of a break/repair option was great since it creates more possibilities for item combinations without having to add more items to find in game.\n\nOn graphics one have to mention the backgrounds which look amazing and the character models are also great to look at when they are stationary. The animations are however not that good and both movement and facial expressions are jerky while the lip-sync in dialogues is even worse. Since one does get used to the faults and still get´s to enjoy the beautiful backgrounds the total impression on graphics is still very positive.\n\nMusic/Audio is for the most time quite nice even though I did find the protagonist Geron to be a bit whiny in the first chapters of the game. He does seem to mature or rather face up to the challenge as the game progresses which is a nice touch. The other characters, both minor and major ones, are well voice acted and adds to the overall positive experience when playing the game.\n\nIn short I will recommend this game for fans of the point-n-click game genre and I would also view it as a good game for those who does not have much experience with puzzle games but want to try one out. The full prize of 20 € does feel a bit steep since the game is not that long but at a sale it´s good time value.","May 27, 2015","true","17.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I so fell in love with the characters and was pretty shaken to see how they were left at the ending (a very dramatic one, I must day), which in itself says a lot about this game: it makes you care. All in all, it's a beautiful game, with great story and lovable characters, if you're into adventure/quest games - buy it, don't think!\nNow, a more detailed opinion.\nIt is very atmospheric due to the incredible hand-drawn backgrounds, some of which are beautiful, and some are moody or even downright scary, but never bland or boring. The characters were created with much love too, they really made me care, and even those characters who appear only for a short period of time are playing their part, be it for humor or to add some dramatic play. And they are, all of them, are not cardboard, they're interesting to see and I felt sorry that some died along the way.\nSo I must say in all honesty that this game's story is better than a lot of books I've had to read. Though, the story felt unfinished regarding some arcs (like, we get to see the fairy land, but don't get to learn what happens to it afterwards), but there's a sequel that I haven't yet played as of writing this review, but I do hope it'll fix those unfinished points.\nAs for the puzzle part, there were a few places that made me scratch my head, but 90% of the puzzles are pretty logical if you think in the terms of "how can I use the surroundings".\nThe only thing that made me cringe (besides the ending), are some animation bugs. I played Mac version, dunno if it happen in the PC one, but running water in the first part of the game and some moving animations very kinda glitchy, when Geron walked it sometimes looked like he's lame on both legs. It did not affect gameplay in any way, just looked weird.","November 19, 2015","true","10.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Instead of adopting the humorous irreverence of many games in this genre, it opts for a far more fairy-tale/ storybook style that sits well in line with the Dark Eye setting.\n\nIn terms of narrative the game offers its own unique perspective on the traditional story line of rescuing the princess/fairy. It's by no means original, but the game developers and writers have done a good job integrating a fairly staid and trope filled story whilst still retaining their own artistic integrity. The immersion within the Dark Eye Universe is deftly handled, a great deal of information is revealed throughout the story, at first leaving the viewer slightly overwhelmed with lists of names of background characters but by the end of the story, it seems most of the lore has been left out so that the richness of the setting is hardly scratched.\n\nThe art direction is highly unique and is in fact Chains of Satinav greatest selling point. The backgrounds are simply exquisite, and the impressionistic rendering of the characters to suit their setting is simply unbelievable. The only issue is the animation, both the speaking and walking animations seem rather jerky and unnatural, probably as a result of the overdetailed character models. At first it is quite disconcerting to see the facial animations however as the game progresses the mind adapts to the irregularity and it becomes slightly less noticeable but still annoying.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, the puzzle elements are particularly well done. Whilst there are still puzzles that seem to obey their own logic rather than true logic, they were fairly far and few between, and on the whole the solutions made a great deal more sense than some of the random item combinations that point n click games are known for. Although this seems to make the game a lot less difficult it also removes a great deal of the annoying item combinations and time wasting staring at inventories and clicking items on items is thankfully removed. The inclusion of the break and mend mechanics added a layer of complexity to the mix but didn't overcomplicate issues. As for the environmental puzzles they range from being fairly generic to two puzzles that were highly appealing due to their unique nature as well as incredible integration into the mythos. It was refreshing to find puzzles that adapted themselves to not only the world itself but served simultaneously as expanding upon the mythology.\n\n\nAs with most point n click games, once completed there isn't really much challenge which would entice a replay, however the charming fairy-tale like story could lead to a replayability factor in much the same way that we return to and revisit beloved children's stories.\n\nIn short it's highly recommended on the basis of it's art, story and puzzles but due to the fact that it is simpler than other point n click games will make it seem a lot shorter on time value.","November 29, 2014","true","12.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

He eventually meets this forrest fairy, Nuri, who he has to protect as she is one of the reasons why grim things start to happen in the lands of Aventuria. Initially it may look like a light-hearted story, but the tone deviates from that soon enough.\n\nNow, the art is simply brilliant, no doubt about that. The hand-drawn/painted backdrops are definitely worthy of a praise as they set an unique vibe and aesthetic to the game. In actual fact, The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav has, at least, some of the best detailed 2D visuals in a point ‘n’ click game to date. It would have been even better having most of its environments more interactive to enhance the experience. The soundtrack is also lovely as each track fits perfectly with each scene and sets the mood accordingly.\n\nBut honestly, that is as much as the game can be lauded for as everything else is either average or beyond mediocre. The story, characters and puzzles have glaring issues which put a toll on my patience and made me uninstall the game just when I was a bit over halfway through. I simply could not stand it any longer.\n\nFirstly, the story is a mixed bag for a fairytale setting. It has a few interesting moments, but these are overshadowed by the amount of monotonous events. Admittedly, the concept seems interesting enough to hold your attention longer than it should, but its writing can be shoddy every now and then. This aspect plagued the game with many pacing issues resulting in this agonisingly slow momentum in the narrative. Things pick up so slowly that you could easily fall asleep on your chair. Personally, the plot did not captivate me at all, and instead it progressively made me try to rush towards the ending as soon as possible. As mentioned previsouly, I quit before I got to the ending, so I have no idea if things get better. 7 hours in felt already too late for things to get appealing in my opinion though.\n\nAdditionally, the main protagonists are generally unlikable. They are boring, wimpy and lack personal charms. Not only that, but the fairy companion, Nuri, that you have to protect and escort up to a point in the story is borderline unbearable. I do not know if the writers' intention was to make her actually sound autistic, but I believe they succeeded to some degree by accident. At least that is the vibe that I got from her during every conversation. It does not help that the English voice acting is also dull as a lot of characters talk too whispery and without much energy in voice projection.\n\nLastly, the puzzles are fairly easy in the beginning and should not pose a problem to veterans of the genre, but they eventually become unintuitive and leave the player wondering what to do next in more than a couple of occasions. Therefore, do not be surprised getting stuck a couple of times later on. One interesting mechanic, though, is the ability to break or fix objects through a magic power which adds an extra layer of challenge in solving certain puzzles. Whilst this is nothing radically innovative, the mechanic is commendable as otherwise the gameplay is the same as in any standard point ‘n’ click adventure game from the past few decades. Sadly, it is only used a few times and not always in the most creative ways.\n\nIn conclusion, The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav had a lot of potential to be at least an engaging point ‘n’ click adventure game set in an already established lore (famously known in Germany), but its agonisingly slow pacing and painfully dull (English) voice acting are the two most prominent sins in this game which suck the majority of the enjoyment -- and closely followed by some of the characters and puzzles. Besides the break/fix mechanic, the game’s gameplay simply does not attempt to challenge the standard already set by the genre since the '90s. Although there is nothing utterly wrong with that, this means that both the story and puzzles, which are both average at best, have to carry the game – and The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav does not succeed in either of them. Much like the developer’s other franchise, Deponia, I was initially captivated by its unique visuals which led me to purchase this game in the first place. Now I wish I knew how mediocre the content is underneath that vibrant coat of paint. At this stage, I do not care how the story ends anymore as I simply could not enjoy the ride and do not want to revisit it. I might watch it on YouTube instead, some day. I cannot recommend this game unless you have an enormous amount of patience and tolerance. If so, I admire you.","January 24","false","7.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","8"

The story is fabulous, and the artwork is even better. This game is so pretty, I couldn't help but take pictures on a lot of the screens. The music and voice acting follow; they are both great. The game surprises you with some dark moments that you don't expect due to the cheeriness of some scenes in the beginning. Lately when I play point and clicks I find myself having to look up solutions to puzzles just because I can spend so long on one thing and start to think it's a bug or something. But I rarely had to look up solutions for this game - Only one or two that got me frustrated. I like to take my time so I'm sure this is excessive, but The Dark Eye kept me entertained for the whole 20 hours it took me to finish it :o Only real gripe is that I wish the ending was developed more, it felt abrupt and not as satisfying as I'd hoped.\n\nEdit: The ending is not a problem if you go right on to Memoria, the sequel, it picks right back up where you left off :)","June 29, 2014","true","29.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Without prior knowledge of this German role-playing game's history, I found the Dark Eye universe fresh while including many beloved conventions of fantasy. From talking animals, to fairies, to sweeping and surreal landscapes, seedy port towns with pirate ships, and memorable characters with distinct personalities, I'd almost say this game comes recommended to any lover of Fantasy period. If you aren't already a fan of point-and-click/puzzle-solving games in general however, I'd say this game, though finely crafted, probably won't be changing your mind. In summary:\n\nPros:\n+ Creative puzzle solving required to advance, aka makes you use your head\n+ Great voice acting which really brought characters to life\n+ Gorgeous art style! The painterly look was implemented beautifully, so kudos to the artist(s) involved with the design work :)\n+ Lovely soundtrack. Morose, ambient, and mysterious. Not a thing out of place\n+ Conclusion feels satisfying and is open-ended enough to lead smoothly into the sequel ("Memoria")\n+ Geron as a protagonist felt well-realized and fleshed out. Repair/destruct mechanic was neat\n+ Limited dialogue choices implemented as a small reference to the game's RP'ing roots\n\nNeutrals/Cons:\n- Although a certain character seriously annoyed me to begin with (manic pixie dream girl whom has trouble taking instructions), she did seem to develop as the story progressed, albeit in a...  not so positive way. The ending kind of sealed the deal for me admiring the direction the story decided to take, and the bittersweet tone felt nicely "realistic"\n- Some jerky animation and performance issues depending on PC and lip syncing was sometimes off\n- A few puzzles I remember as requiring one to not only think outside the box, but obsessively scope out every vaguely pick-able object in the environment. You will no doubt be seeking some kind of help from a guide or hotspot indicator by the end of it (and if not, WOW)\n\nOverall:\n8.5 out of 10\n\nThe Dark Eye: CoS is a unique game with a storyline which seeks to stand out, and for the most part I would say it has succeeded. If you're a fan of well-written fantasy stories (with that classic German spin on darker undertones), check out this game, and consider supporting Daedalic's work.","November 22, 2015","true","27.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

From human-sized fairies to blue beard dwarves to Black Fur Orcs to Imps and so on. I loved the imaginary creatures like the Oculonculus with his Oglescope, the Peaclock bird and the optical illusions with the flow of water.\n\nCONS\n1.

The art design was really neat even though I wish the lip speach had more work. Probably my favorite part was the fact that I could play most of this game without a walkthrough. Which means I've either gotten better from playing the other Daedalic games or this one was easier. Either way, I really enjoyed it. Obviously I wish it was longer but it has a sequal which I will play next. RIght now, I'd say this series is far superior to the Deponia trilogy.

Even though the story is not the most original and shocking tale i've ever experienced, it was interesting enough to keep me going the whole time. The characters are interesting and very well written, the backgrounds are gorgeous (just look at some of the screenshot I took!), and the puzzles are not half bad (maybe a tad bit too easy, although at least there are some twists to the original formula especially in one particular place within the game).\nFor these reasons I'd recommend the game even though it's not perfect. For me the voice acting wast the biggest annoyance, most of the side characters are passable, but the protagonist (Geron) speaks sooo softly in every situation, it's really off-putting. The other thing is the character-animation, sadly it's really choppy and the lip-sync is often way off. This could be bothersome for some people, I got used to it after an hour or so. These are just minor technicalities though and shouldn't keep fans of the genre from giving this a shot.","January 16, 2014","true","10.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I will recommend this under a few conditions. It's not a great game but if you love stories, as I do, it's worth experiencing. Probably a "sale buy," which is what I did.\n\nGameplay was ok. There were only a few puzzles I really enjoyed and only a few that really stumped me. Thankfully there were only a few times that I felt the eventual solution made no sense, but they are there.\n\nHowever, this is a story and character driven game. For most of the game, I didn't like Geron, the protagonist. He spends most of the game whining about how people treat him and he has bad luck, both due to a prophesy that he is a herald of doom. He finally meets someone who doesn't know about this prophesy and actually likes him, but he's a total jerk to her for a while. In contrast to the whiny Geron, you'll have sweet, naive Nuri. She is what drove the game for me, but I admit that's partially due to my natural protective instincts, so your mileage may vary.\n\nLater Geron does develop affection of at least a friendly sort for Nuri and does want to help her. However it still takes longer for him to get past his problems. When he FINALLY does, he FINALLY becomes a protagonist I could get behind. The end of the game is amazing, but I won't spoil it. As I said at the start, if you like stories, it's worth a discount buy to experience.\n\nSo what about other aspects? First, you are treated to some fantastic main menu music. However you will then play a game with almost no music. Sometimes this makes sense, as sound might be important in a very few scenes, but mostly it just makes the game oddly quiet. This seems to be only so that the game can reward you with a small musical line when you solve a puzzle. I'd rather have more good music.\n\nOn the topic of sound, most of the voice acting, including the main character, is terrible. There is one section, where he spins a tall tale, that sounds genuine, but in most conversations, it's very bad. There are a few exceptions, the most notable being the second main character, Nuri. She has a lovely voice and does a great job. It's one of the reasons I really like the character.\n\nVisually, the game is a mix and I never thought I'd see such extremes in one work. The background art and characters look great. However the animations are awful. This is particularly true with the characters' faces as they talk. It's a painted style, so they only have a few different frames they use.","September 15, 2015","true","12.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Ok, the settings are wonderful. Even better than wonderful actually. I can understand this is reason enough to play the game entirely. I should add that it got me very far.\nBut apart from these drawings, there is nothing interesting in Chains of Satinav. It's a very basic point&click, with pixel hunting and puzzles created by people who smoke a bit too much. But the true shadow is the story and the characters. It looks like the game adaptation of The Black Cauldron.\nI couldn't finish the game. Not because of the difficulty (which isn't very high), but because it's boring. Very boring.

Fed up with the useless girl, her irritating laughter, her profound stupidity and the fact that she's only here to sleep with the main character at the end (no matter how  many times he lied to her through the game).

You know that kind of person who played through most of Lucas Arts and Sierra games during the early 1990’s and still thinks that LOOM was a great game and who, when someone says pirate, spontaneously starts humming the LeChuck theme? Yep, that's me.\n\nBefore we begin, it should also be noted that I have never played the pen-and-paper version of The Dark Eye. Save for my encounter with The Blackguards (another game by Daedalic) I have had no prior experience of the rich lore of The Dark Eye universe.\nThis review is based on my three playthroughs of The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav (one regular + two achievement runs).\n\nLet us begin with the good stuff…\nThe graphics +++++\n\n…are absolutely stunning, with a high sense of details put into the making of every 2D background. Nowadays you can expect to find this level of quality in many games, but in my opinion, 2D art truly comes to show in point-and-click adventure games, whereas it tends to be overlooked in other genres. In TDE:CoS the scenery seamlessly intertwines with the storyline. You can see that the sketch artists allowed themselves to be touched by the story... and possibly a wee a bit of fairy magic was involved as well.\n\nThe music ++++\n\n…is also great, in all its simplicity. The tunes blend into the background so that you never take your mind off the storytelling. Instead of using their whole arsenal, the team who made the music carefully chose instruments that would mix well with both the story and the elfish concept art used in this game.\n\nVoice acting ++(+)\n\nMost of the voice actors did a decent job. Overall it’s not that great, but good enough to do the game justice. Most adventure games let you down when it comes to the speech. Perhaps I'm too old-fashioned, but voice acting kind of kills the spirit, doesn't it? It almost always ruins the imagination for me. How does a beautiful fairy sound like? Or a talking crow? A brutish orc? Perhaps you have a tingling sensation of the sound in your mind, but forget about trying to mimic that sound with your own voice. The task of giving voices to magical creatures is a task best left for professionals and in TDE:CoS some actors were obviously more professional than others. Several characters does not sound anywhere near authentic (putting aside my subjective opinion of the matter, they simply sound way too scripted, which I believe most players would agree with). Then there are others with great voices.\n\nTowards the middle of the game, you’ve gotten used to it. The female voice actors did an overall much better job than their male counterparts in this game. Or perhaps the dialogue was better suited for female voices, having been written and scripted by a woman?\n\nAs a side note: have you ever played the game called "Simon the Sorcerer[www.gog.com]"? If not, I feel for you. It was a lovely little gem of its time and as every other game from the early PC/Amiga gaming industry it was (initially) released without voice effects. Save for a few sound effects and background music, you never knew how Simon, the mages, trolls or any other of the absolutely hilarious beings in that game sounded like. And that was... g r e a t. Later on, they dubbed it (of course). Which version do you think received the highest scores?\n\nAnd I guess that’s my point; players have learned to expect mesmerizing graphics and all characters to have high-quality voices, no matter what. Some games try to come up with nifty workarounds (Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons comes to mind) but most such attempts fail. As a developer, you might not dare to let your product come off as a low-budget/indie game at first glance. But most of the times, less is indeed more.\n\nThe storyline ++++\n\n…actually works! I didn't quite know what to expect when I started playing this game. I had not read any reviews prior to playing it but I have (sadly) learned the hard way to lower my expectations whenever I tryout modern fantasy adventures. But TDE:CoS felt more like a child's story, having been tucked away inside the writer's mind for many years before being put to the pen and shared with the rest of the world. With a box office budget, I'm sure that this game could have been turned into a decent movie script. As such, the limitations of a point-and-click adventure sometimes makes the story come off a bit crude and rough around the edges. But it's nothing that you can't polish up a bit with your own imagination (if you allow yourself to focus on the good stuff and ignore the rest).\n\nMy consensus after playing the game from start to end three times in just a few days is that the story is probably a lot larger than what could be depicted from this rather small game. As a player, I strolled along through the chapters but ended up craving more after each intermission (which is a good sign, right?) instead of the short cut scenes. Same goes, without a doubt, for the ending.\n\nPerhaps the cut-scenes could have been more "layered" (in lack of a better word for it) to give them a bit more depth. Or perhaps the game could be filled with more dialogues, background stories and side-quest-lore that players could explore at their own leisure?\n\nSo, let’s knock off the most negative aspects of the game while we’re at it…\nThe coding/scripting\n\nThe single worst part of this game is irritably the part that should have been the easiest to get right: the coding and scripting of actions in the game. Although TDE:CoS should be more than able to run smoothly on almost any computer you could find today, it often slows down and feels sluggish between important actions and in scenes where the main character has to move from one side of the screen to the other. Why on earth did Daedalic not make this better? It saddens me to see such a seemingly easy task being carelessly ignored, especially when you consider the astonishing work made by the other members of the developing team.\n\nThe animations\n\nWhoever cleared these animations should have their eyesight checked out immediately. Save from a few exceptions, I have not seen animated 2D stills of such poor quality since... gee, we’re talking pixelated 1990’s here. Forget all about expecting smooth 12 fps stuff. Honestly, people of Daedalic, I implore you to search for better animators for future titles. And to forego any quirky remarks; no, I haven't played the sequel (Memoria) yet and no, I have no idea if the animations improved later on in the game series. But I surely hope so. The story and its characters deserve it.\n\nHad it not been for the lush scenery and music that straight off the bat inspired me to delve deeper into the game, I might actually have stopped playing TDE:CoS after just a few minutes due to the poor animations - that’s how bad they are.\n\nBut to everyone who has not yet bought the game: ignore all comments about the animations. Yes, sure, they suck. Yes, they will tick you off at first glance. But after a while you simply ignore them, because the rest of the game more than makes up for it. And they improve after a few chapters.\n\nOverall conclusion\nI think this game is a pearl. At the end I wanted to keep the characters with me in that same longing feeling you get after finishing a good book (or trilogy, as everything seems to be these days). Sure, some of the edges are a bit rough, but who cares when you end up falling in love with this dreamlike adventure after just a few paces into the game?\n\nAfterall, isn't that what adventures are supposed to be like?","January 24, 2015","true","30.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game has some of the best "hand drawn" art work going.  Secondly, the story...as with a lot of point'n'click adventure games, it has a very tongue in cheek clichéd approach to its story but my word it pulls it off very well.  It has been many a year that I have actually sat at work, watching the second’s tick away waiting to get home just to play more of a game.  Thirdly, some of the puzzles are actual brain ticklers.  I have played a lot of these adventure games over the years and for a while now, it was almost like I was just going through the motions...you know "I have a fish, I have some water, I have some beans...I bet I need to cook something with these...oh look there is a pot over there...let’s put these in and cook something". Yes this game does have some very basic puzzles but as mentioned before, it also has some right pain in the ♥♥♥♥ ones that actually make you sit back and have to think "hang on...how the f**k am I supposed to do this..."\n\n*Cons*\nThere are a few glitches here and there.\nSome of the voice acting is a bit hit and miss.\nAlso a lot of the NPC's are quite forgettable (not all though)\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nIf you like Point'n'Click adventure games, then add this one to your library ASAP!

Not only is it rather short, and has almost no "aftermath scenes" at all, I also consider it to be very bittersweet, which is something some people cannot or would rather not stomach.\n\nThe game's art-style is amazing, one can see in every single scene that there really went a lot of effort into making this. Every scene or location is drawn with amazing detail and all of them would make great dektop backgrounds/wallpapers (^_^).\n\nAbout the world of TDE/DSA itself I would say that it (as always) aims to fulfill every single lame cliché about high fantasy there is, though it's still a little closer to the standard J.R.R. Tolkien set in terms of the general availability and effect of Magic than most other fantasy settings. Still it is as usually heavily focused on it's fantasy pantheon, which I personally find irritating and annoying. The gods here, the gods there, this and that god be praised and fifteen others grant me power and so forth...\nStill the setting is 'thankfully' mostly just medieval dreariness so that's stomachable.\n\nAnyway, I hope this could give you some insights to help you decide whether or not you want to buy this game. I seriously recommend it to everyone who likes Point & Click adventures and who isn't too focused on always being bombarded with endless comedy in them.","May 18, 2014","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some of the biggest appeals are the story, beautifully fleshed-out backdrop, and the "close-to-home" fantasy lore that gives its fans exactly what they want in a game of its genre. The one thing that stands out as a possible set-back for some, perhaps is the cryptic and seemingly random nature of a handful of the puzzles throughout the game. Some puzzles seem obvious right away, others not so much. This game had me close out multiple times to eyeball a walkthrough to figure out what I was doing. I believe a good point-and-click can at least provide some clues that may be subtle and not deduct from the gameplay. I felt that this game was lacking that sort of "user friendliness" in some moments, especially when you are given items in your inventory that are used in highly unconventional ways. Maybe this is part of what makes this game interesting--testing out possible uses for an item with the interface or with other items...but where does it flip to tedium for the gamer?\n\nThe plot and art style of the game is what kept me hooked, there's a nice balance between clicking around just to explore an area and clicking around for items and descriptions of things to be used later.\n\nI recommend this game for its engrossing easy, and fair amount of dialogue that doesn't wear you down. For those who get easily frustrated toying with different objects in order to advance to the next screen, this game probably isn't for you.

At the end I felt bad for Nuri.\n\nPros\n- Great story\n- Beautiful scenery\n- Nuri\n- Voice acting\n- Hints\n\nCons\n- Animations could be better\n\nOverall looking that it is a point and click game I did not expect great graphics similar to adventure detective games like Noire, but I was quite taken by the graphical beauty of this game. Gameplay was refreshing although some moments could make you stuck for a while figuring out the puzzle.\n\nFinal verdict is solid 7/10 - Its worth playing for the story and beauty of the world.","January 18, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story was dark, but not enough to make someone depressed or anything. The art was well-done. The music was good. The puzzles were challenging (particularly in the fairy world). The main character was likeable enough and fairly developed well. Spoiler: I'm also glad that it didn't end on a cliché in which the main character ended up with the leading female character in some happily ever after-like setting.\n\nComplaints regarding story: They could've developed Nuri (the leading female character) a bit more. Spoiler: I get that the queen of the fairy world was tricked by the Seer, but I didn't really get why she was so crazy. Her sister didn't seem that way.  Another spoiler: It's possible I might've missed this, but I also don't understand how Nuri was able to leave her world. I get that she left because her mom went crazy and started making the world dark, but with all those rules, I wonder how she got away. I also wonder why the queen never mentions her missing daughter, unless that's part of how she's crazy.\n\nTechnical complaints: There were some slight glitches here and there with the graphics being too big (out of proportion to the scene), but nothing that a re-load couldn't fix. There was also this part in which I couldn't get another story option to appear until I went through a character's dialogue twice.\n\nDespite the flaws though, I really enjoyed this game. It kept me interested throughout the whole story, which is important for a game full of puzzles, because they can get a bit tedious and if I don't have enough interest in the story, I might just give up on it.\n\nDefinitely get it if you enjoy adventure, point-and-click games, rich story, and puzzles.","December 17, 2014","true","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The "Deponia" series, for instance, is ruined by the protagonist's rampant racism and misogyny; "The Whispered World" is ruined by the protagonist's relentless moping and whining; and "A New Beginning" is ruined by the unbearably morose protagonists and hysterically alarmist agenda. This game, however? It's like it was published by someone else entirely. The protagonists are delightful and the message is remarkably heartfelt. There are times when Geron & Nuri can be irritating, but those moments make sense in context and help express the difficulty the characters have adapting to the trials and tribulations which beset them. And that might be the most important thing about this game -- the characters ADAPT. They change. They grow and learn from their experiences. I haven't played a point-and-click adventure game this good since the last "Monkey Island" game! If this were a comedy (which it very much isn't), it might even give that series a run for its money!\n\nThe art is beautiful, the narrative is simple but engaging, the voice-acting is splendid, the characters are likeable, and the gameplay is perfect.

Geron, having lost both of his parents, was raised by Gwinnling the bird catcher. During his youth, he witnessed the death of an evil seer. As the evil seer was being put to the stake, he foretold that the young Geron would bring doom upon the town of Andergast. This prophecy fuelled the superstitious nature of the townsfolk and caused him much grief as he grew up with. In order to prove the seer and everyone else wrong, Geron decided to take part in a competition, in which the victor would be honoured by the King. As Geron sets his eye on the prize, his adoptive father, Gwinnling, seems to have more pressing concerns in mind... Certain concerns that relate to a dead seer and signs that point to his return.

I was looking to play something different for a change from my usual strategy games, so I picked this up on sale.\n\nI was surprised with how good the game was.   I would not say it is up there with the best - and I have played some of the best - but is a very solid adventure game.   The most outstanding quality is the art style.   It's unique and pleasing, although  a bit different aethsetic than most are used too probably, so takes some adjusting at first.  Still, it is a very beautiful game.  The voice acting and music is excellent.\n\nThe story is pleasing and will pull you in.  Mostly light and humorous at first, but there are definitely some darker moments.\n\nThe game is made by German developers and the influence there is strong.   I'd say a related impact is on endings to stories -as the endings tend to not always be what you expect or not necessarily as satisfying to certain tastes.  Yet, is still something different and enjoyable dependiing on your perspective.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable tale woven in what is really more of an old-school type point and click adventure game.  The puzzles are generally on the easy to medium side, but there are some stumpers here and there and puzzle or clues that are not that intuitive.  For the most part though, you should not have much trouble with them.\n\nLastly, the game has a satisfying lenght to it.  I actually thought I was near the end of the game at one point only to be pleased to find that I wasn't maybe a little over half-way through.\n\nDefinitely recommended for fans of adventure games, or those looking for a good game to try out the genre.","January 4","true","18.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Both Daedalic and The Dark Eye have had difficulties with gaining currency in the English-speaking world, but based on this adventure (my first contact with Daedalic) the fault may lie in the Anglo-American cultural attitudes, for Chains of Satinav was absorbing and challenging in equal measure.\n\nUnlike in so many adventures, the lead is not a wisecracker but rather a serious young man hexed with bad luck and shunned by society because of this. Yet the game feels more like a Grimm story than a typical fantasyland, either in high or low mode. Since "gritty, mature fantasy worlds" usually mean dwarves with liver cirrhosis and bisexual elven terrorists I am happy with this design choice. There is a general feel of sadness everywhere and the themes deal with innocence and corruption.\n\nThe graphics fit the above naturally and the hand-crafted scenery are lush yet clear. Colors are never garish nor murky and the visual presentation is an exact fit to my personal tastes. Animations are slighly limited, true, but that did not lessen my gaming pleasure. All sounds good too, especially the melancholy soundtrack which avoided the fake epic stylings so prevalent in many other titles. Settings are varied as well, from a crime-rotten port town to another plane where normal logics are superseded by fairytale equivelants.\n\nPuzzles are typically logical and the solutions are within reason but occasionally the clues are rather obscure and this can lead into confusion, especially in the fairy worls already mentioned. There are limited help options of which I used the hotspot highlighter, meaning that a button push shows all the interactive parts of the screen. Dialogue is more clear than flowery or punning and despite being based on a pre-existing RPG world there were, incredibly, no lore dumps anywhere. Since the story sees a downbeat young man protecting an innocent young woman I am unsure how the feminists would see that aspect but I did not see misogyny anywhere, nor other prejudices.\n\nAs a whole this 10-hour game was a positive first taste of the Daedalic adventures and I will most certainly play the other ones as well. Definitely recommended for adventure fans.","October 19, 2013","true","10.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The latter may be something you have to overlook when you're used to the more high-budget kind of games, but it definitely pays off on the long run. The more time you invest in this game, the more you will feel involved in the story and its two main characters.\n\nEspecially the quirky Nuri makes for a fun companion throughout the game, though it's a bit of a shame that some of the in-line jokes are sometimes lost in translation since German is the main language here.

Puzzels are logical and I only briefly got suck once or twice, more due to my own stupidity though rather than dodgy mechanics. If there would be one critique there is that the game doesn't really innovate the genre, so if you can't stand classic point&clicks or narratively driven games you might be at the wrong address. But seriously you should get this game for the writing alone!","December 1, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Character development is certianly second fiddle to the story but they do a decent job of showing Geron's evolution throughout and with response choice you get to make along the way.

The art style can only be described as an animated oil painting, and while the animation was only just adequate, the backgrounds in this game are absolutely gorgeous...the true selling point.  They story is captivating and the characters suffient enough to carry it although I did find the end a bit anticlimactic.\n\nI have to say, for a P&C, it was pleasant to find so many straight forward puzzles.  I love the genre and grew up with it, but i have low tolerance for frustration and will often "walk-through" before ripping my hair out trying everything against everything in my inventory.  Most of the solutions all made pretty clear sense.  Of course in the second half of the game there are a couple of instances of old adventure game pitfalls where I found myself saying, "come on, really??" when the solution was presented, but overall an easy play for a casual P&C adventurer.\n\nI enjoyed it but I'm not raving.  My recommendation is wishlisting it until another sale comes along.","January 11, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

They've won me over with an absolutely charming story.\n\nNow, let me start of by mentioning the drawbacks of the game. The voice acting is a hit or miss kind of situation. Some voices like the main characters, Nuri, Geron, and the Raven, were alright most of the time but others like that one eyed creature, the fairy queen, and the dwarf were so laughably bad that I had to turn down the volume. I just read the subtitles. But that brings up another problem. Something definitely went wrong with the english translation because there are a few awkward yet brief pauses and bad logical leaps with the writing. And the puzzles were a bit too easy to go through. The game also drops frames hard when real time texture compression is turned on.\n\nHowever, the story and the characters were just so damn charming and endearing that I just had to know how things would turn out for them. The story has that same fantasy feeling I had playing through games like the Longest Journey and Dreamfall. The music and the art is also fantastic. If given the chance to buy the soundtrack and artbook, go ahead. It's not a bad move.\n\nI would definitely recommend The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav to anyone that loves fairytales and has the patience for the drawbacks I mentioned.","December 7, 2013","true","10.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It immediatelly anchors you to the atmosphere, which is something that i as a visually oriented person throughly enjoy. The characters, while not may help to make the exprience even more engaging. Really the only fault i would find is that at 10h it might seem a little short. That being said, the feeling that the story went by so fast, and the wishing that it would last longer is often the trademark of the genre, is it not?\nI should perhaps note that the puzzles in the game, while fun are not extremelly difficult, so if that is what you are looking for you might consider another game. However if you are like me and are interested in a good story, then i'd recommend this game with all my heart. Because in the end heart is this game's greatest strenght, that and the fact that throughout the game it  leaves you entirely enchanted.\n\nPs. Oh and by the way the story does last longer as it is continued on in the sequel Memoria, the link to which you should see below and which game i'm told even surpasses this one (i've not played it as of yet, but i believe my source)","January 19, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

He's no hero though, and everyone blames him for being the herald of doom which is obviously not encouraging at all, his journey neither easy nor glorious. As for the gameplay, it's not the most challenging quest out there, but at the same time the game never gives you clear hints to your actions so you have to pay attention. The storyline is really charming and has a strong "dark European medieval fantasy" feel to it (well, I suppose it's only natural, considering the Dark Eye setting), and the backdrops are breathtakingly beatiful, each scene working towards creating memorable atmosphere of the whole game. Voice acting was better than I've expected, but it's no Deponia. Overall, I'd recommend spending some time on this game even if you're not too keen on point-and-click adventures.

It’s a very slow point ‘n’ click adventure with depressing atmosphere, engaging characters and interesting motivations that move them throughout the story.\n\nLong version:The German role-playing world of Dark Eye is not new for PC players; the setting was home for the Realm of Arkania and Drakensang games. ‘Chains of Satinav’, unlike those classic ARPGs, is a traditional point ‘n’ click adventure game with little action in it.\n\nSo little action, that it is almost boring. You move slowly, the story moves slowly, and all the voice actors speak like reading an audio book. So, even though the game is about an everyman teaming up with a fairy girl in order to save his kingdom from the icy doom of an evil wizard, it feels like watching an art film.\n\nWhat is lacking in plot is gained in the exceptional characters and their motivations; it doesn’t matter if someone is the protagonist or just a one-scene character, they get the same care and detail. This not only helps in fleshing out this stereotypical story, but makes you emotionally invested in every little aspect of it.\n\nWith a fantasy setting it is easier to find new roles to seemingly everyday items, which in an adventure game translates to increased difficulty due to inverted logic. As the story progresses, this can reach the point where even veterans may get stuck for some time, especially when the game starts to add complex combination puzzles.\n\nAll by itself, ‘Chains of Satinav’ is nothing exceptional. Until you learn that this story is required to play the sequel, Memoria. And believe me… even if this would be the worst game ever, it would be worth it to fully enjoy the greatness of Memoria.","June 22, 2015","true","17.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Nothing much actually happens aside from the events right at the start that set things in motion and a sudden "turn of events" some two thirds of the way through the game, nor do you learn much of interest about the plot after the start of the game.\n\nThe protagonist is relatively uninteresting to start with and he doesn't develop or "grow" during the course of the adventure. Same thing with the relationship between the protagonist and his protegé - it doesn't develop meaningfully and nothing really happens, with one noteworthy exception; by the end they still haven't really said anything to eachother that couldn't have been said within the first five minutes.\n\nWhen it comes to the puzzles I thought they required too much lateral thinking and occasionally simply trial and error - as opposed to logic - to solve. Too often it wasn't quite clear what the purpose of doing certain allowed actions was, and I used items on other items or hotspots "because I could", and was left wondering why until a contrived reason materialized itself after having done some other things.\n\nThe voice acting was pretty good. The graphics, well you can check those in the screenshots yourself. I thought they looked good to begin with, but by the end I had kind of stopped noticing the backgrounds and just looked around for the hotspots in order to get it over with.","October 4, 2014","false","46.5"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

The story was very good and much darker than any of their other games I've played. The puzzles were extremely well designed. They all fit into the story line and made sense; no randomly clicking and combining everything with everything in order to try and progress. If you thought about it, the solution always was logical. The difficulty is never that high as there are never more than 3-4 screens that you can traverse through at any given point.  Rather than limit freedom this seemed to make the plot's pacing better and I enjoyed the design choice.  The main character has a special ability to break certain things with a spell and then to fix them which made for some very clever puzzle solutions. The dialog did a great job of directing you too so that you always knew what your objectives were. The voice acting was hit and miss, but mostly miss.  This is too bad because the writing is very good and there is a major disconnect between what you the player are seeing/feeling and how the voice actors portray this in their performances.  The animation style took a little getting used to.  The had drawn artwork is beautiful so it is too bad that the animation doesn't live up to it.  It was kind of distracting for the first 30 minutes or so and then I either got used to it or it got better. (Most likely I just got used to it)  Even with its faults in animation and voice acting, the tale, the excellent puzzle design, and the dark fantasy setting is good enough that I was able to look past the flaws and really enjoy the adventure.  The ending left a lot of loose ends so I am looking forward to playing the sequel, Memoria soon.  Hopefully they fix the faults of this one and it can be really great.

After that you can breeze through your second easy-mode playthrough in half an hour. If you're not a begginer do yourself a favor and don't start it on easy mode, it will get seriously -and boringly- way too easy.

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #37 - The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav\n\nThe Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is a point and click adventure game.  It's based on a pen and paper German RPG that I knew nothing about beforehand.  I'm also normally not much of an adventure game player, so this is definitely the kind of game I wouldn't have normally picked up.\n\nThat said, I ended up enjoying this game more than I expected.  Only playing for an hour makes it pretty impossible to judge the game on it's story, but I'll say that I liked what I saw of it.  I wasn't rolling my eyes at any obvious cliches.  And I appreciated that the game doesn't beat you over the head with a ton of exposition at the start of the game.\n\nAll of the dialogue with other characters is voiced, and I thought the voice acting was pretty good.  I really liked the art style, and felt all of the backgrounds were really well done.\n\nAs with any adventure game you can expect to be solving puzzles.  From what I saw this looked like the typical point and click adventure kind of fare: finding the right objects and using them on the right things.  One thing I liked was the ability to turn hotspots on or off.\n\nMy only issues with the game had to do with the game engine itself.  I wished the transition between areas was a little quicker and more seamless.  Moving the mouse felt very sluggish at times, and there isn't any way to change the sensitivity.  The mouse cursor would also jump around when first transitioning to a new area, kind of like things were still loading in the background and slowing everything down.\n\nOverall the game engine just didn't feel very optimized.  I tried switching to full screen instead of windowed mode, and this didn't make any difference.  This brings up another annoyance in having to restart the game just to switch between windowed and full screen mode.  For what it's worth, I have a midrange desktop and I'm not using onboard graphics.

However, there is very little else enjoyable other than the graphics.\n\n1) Mechanics was awkward, movements were staggered between transitions. This was very distracting.\n\n2) Puzzles sometimes made little sense. In more than a few occasion you're left with very little hint as to what you're supposed to figure out or what the goal is. Puzzles follow poor and warped logic.\n\n2) Little character development: This is what got me the most. It was incredibly difficult to become attached to the characters or feel anything for them. The main character, Geron, exudes arrogance and incompetence. He consistently lies to Nuri, the other character, and treats her like a child. He shows little change from this shallow character throughout the game. He makes the whole gameplay feel like a chore.\n\nNuri's character is even "flatter" and one dimensional, she rarely makes any meaningful dialoogue beyond random comments and giggles. She causes trouble and makes irrational demands. It was difficult not to feel annoyed of her.\n\n3) Dull story line. Characters come and go, each with a brief dialogue and brief interaction. They throw all these details of folklore at you but it is so poorly presented and lackluster.\n\n\nOverall, I was really looking forward to loving this game. The non-existent character development and the awkward voice acting made it feel like I was playing a online point-and-click flash game, where the characters' existnece was just for solving ridiculous puzzles.  After a few hours I felt myself wishing the game to be over already , I will not recommend this game.","January 4","false","2.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The two spells provide an interesting, but ultimately underutilized device.\n\nCons: For a game of this genre, there needs to be either some challenge/innovation in the puzzle solving, or some degree of user determination (or otherwise deep investment) in the narrative's course.  Simply put, either the mechanisms by which the narrative is unlocked piece by piece need to be entertaining and satisfying, or the decisions that move the narrative forward need to be engaging. Ideally, both.\n\nIn this instance, the plot plods on deterministically with zero input from the player as to how relationships develop, characters grow, and moral decisions are made. Which may be due to a total lack of meaningful relationships, character growth, or moral decisions in the narrative. This is a shame, as there was ample opportunity for meaningful choices to be made that were passed up instead for rather trite and forced outcomes. As to the "puzzles", there was always one solution, and it almost always veered between extremes of either being blatantly easy or almost completely unintuitive. Frequently I found myself clicking things into place with no real concept of what the intended outcome was supposed to be until it happened.","August 30, 2015","false","10.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The graphics are rich and, as a point-and-click adventure, the game is better than most.\n\nUp until this point, Daedalic has never failed to keep me engaged with their work.\n\nThere is, however, a single glaring issue that I cannot ignore (which has completely killed any chances of my enjoying this game):\n\nThe game is utterly unplayable due to *constant* runtime errors and crashing.  The crashes happen ALL THE TIME.  I can't progress through a single chapter without (at least) twenty crashes.  It happens every single time I get through a sequence of the game.\n\nI've scoured all the forums, from GOG, to Steam, to Daedalic.

I have to say, this game has lost a bit of luster after playing the other titles, and gets downgraded to more of a "probably not" than a "yes" from me. Upon further analysis, the game is incredibly sexist: Nuri is basically a thing Geron drags around to use her magic power or to hit switches or levers he can't reach. She's barely a person, and dumb as a brick. Geron and Nuri are constantly declaring their undying love for each other in both this one and the sequel, and yet they almost never talk, grow, or get to know each other on screen. While the setting and writing is otherwise decent, the inherent sexism that carries through basically all Daedalic titles is rampant in this one. If that will be a problem you can't see past, I would avoid this one.\n\nOtherwise, my old review still stands as follows, as I DO like the art, setting, and puzzles:\n\nVery cool. Fun story, very pretty graphics.  I'll admit to having been truly stumped by several of the puzzles. It was usually because I had missed a clickable in another room; the handpainted graphics mean that clickables are really easy to miss against the background without using the highlight button, which of course feels like a cheat to experienced point-&-click adventurers like myself. The puzzles all had an internal logic to them. There were almost no occassions where I had to use a random thing that makes no sense like in some point-&-clicks. (Another thing that always throws me off in this type of game is when to use that one item that the character never drops (Indy's whip, Geron's knife in this case, etc.). It's a personal blind spot that I always forget I have it. Fair warning: Geron uses his knife a lot, specifically to acquire other items (pieces of rope, cloth, etc.))  Overall, very fun.\n\nAlso, I'm an old D&Der, and this kind of makes me want to drop it altogether in favor of the Dark Eye system/setting from Germany.\n\nProbably the primary complaint I have is the English voice actors. Both Geron's and Nuri's voice actors were very stilted and kind of felt like they phoned it in. Their writing was decent, but they didn't convey emotion very well.","October 13, 2014","false","15.3"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","0"

The pace is too slow with a lot (I mean A LOT) of story-telling via cutscenes, in between unchallenging puzzles and confusing world design. The characters have got some cool special abilities, like breaking and mendning objects by magic, which very well could have been this game's rescue, but it falls too short due to a limited amount of use and a far too linear story. The game is good-looking, and the acting is good, but it's not a game I enjoyed playing.\n\n4/10.

I don't know if the original German fantasy series is this bad, but the plot is totally wishy-washy. It's about some great evil being reincarnated, so you TRICK a fairy or mentally disabled girl (depending on your perspective) into going back to her "fairyland". There is NO HUMOUR, and It takes itself too seriously.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nEveryone has generic British accent. The characters also aren't even likable. Your main character is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who doesn't really seem to care what's going on around him. He's got a wimpy magic allowing him to break fragile objects. You use this ability maybe 5 times in the entire game.\n\nThe girl is mentally disabled, as I mentioned earlier. She will see a butterfly gets crushed into pus and ask, "Is she okay?" She talks to inanimate objects and drunk people, and gets into baths with other naked men without question...\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nNot bad, but half the time you're running around clicking everything you can think of instead of thinking what would logically follow.\n\nI spent 7 hours on it, regret it so much.\n\nRating: 0/10.","November 15, 2013","false","5.6"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","10","27","0","0"

They look great when the picture is still, but once your character starts moving it looks like a cheap game that has been tried to make look more valuable with the great pictures.\nIt's really hard to know what you can and cannot do here and the scenes are very complicated. You see silver arrows pointing the ways to other scenes, you pick the first one and get into the second scene. You go back to the first scene, choose another arrow and you're back in the second scene. Wait, what? Then you try to get back into the second one but end up in a third one. Point being, it's really messed up.\n\nAnd since it's so hard to know what you can or cannot do or what you're supposed to do and what not, I lost the interest in the game pretty quickly. Sure it's easy to pick stuff up into your inventory for later use, but you'll find so much things that fit absolutely nowhere even though there are lots of places you can interact with that it just messes everything up.\n\nUnless you're REALLY patient and willing to do about a hundred clicks per a scene, number of scenes early in the game being more than four, I do not recommend the game.\n\nPlus, the character you play as seems like a whiney little kid who goes to the guards when others don't play fairly with you (even when they haven't done anything against the rules, which, btw do not even exist)...

If you do, and you loved it as much as I did, then you'll love this game, too. It uses a very similar style of graphics. The story is deep, and the puzzles are perplexing. Try to resist using a walkthrough, and immerse yourself in it. If $20 is too much, then wait for it to go on sale like I did. I couldnt stop playing it until I was finished, and I can't wait to start Memoria.\n\nThe game could have used more descriptive dialog to get you to go in the right direction, as there were several hair-pulling areas. However, that did not take away from the feel of the game. I wish I could expeience The DIg all over again for the first time, and in some ways, this game has brought me back to that place.\n\nI totally recommend this game if you're looking for a little more imagination and creativity and a little less running and gunning.

Yes, that's it!\n\nLet's take it from the start. When this game was published on Steam, I wanted to buy it like hell but I said that others will follow. Still liked it much. But as far as I played it proved to be a completely fairy tale, maybe a very good one, but still a fairy tale. No, I don't have problem with fairy tales. I like them, but because they're easy to be made all the companies and especially Daedalic Entertainment has made a lot. I have played many games from the company and I wish to play them all. But really, more than half of the games are fairy tales. I liked most "Lost Horizon" or the "Gray Matter","RunAway" and many more from other companies and "A New Beginning",maybe "Deponia"series to that matter from Daedalic. Those games have a background to the real world and in modern era they can be called sandboxes.. ANYWAY, to the game...\n\nGraphics are good. The engine here is similar to the "Night of the Rabbit" and I should say again, a great graphic engine for fairy tales. Yes, it makes them look good,really! Great colors,beautiful sketches, that kind of stuff. The only thing that made me curious is a setting about texture compression. It is the first game since many years now that ran without that setting that is a MUST to all 3D games in order for the game to run without delays. The opposite,when this setting was ON the game had delays. I don't know. Maybe the programmers have reversed settings by no means.. Really weird thing.  In my system I would say though that the game has some bugs because sometimes the characters vanished from screen and came in again in dialogues and some others after the first half of the game and NOT every time. Sometimes. I also had some dialogue problems when sometimes the game had another language spoken and no English. I had to translate in google to solve some riddles. But those were NOT enough to make me stuck. Another weak spot is the videos.You'll see sketches,drawn in hand and a voice to say a part of the tale in days that we could use 3D animation. All the videos are in the same style.\n\nThe sound is good and the music too. No complain here. The game has also a great soundtrack made of knightofsoundtrack.net. Really good music inside and the voices were ok if not excellent. So, if you are like me, be free to turn up your hi-fi connected to the PC and enjoy.\n\nRiddles and difficulty. Here we are at last. The game until you made it to the smugglers' city is just a walk. But from there and on the riddles become challenging. No,you'll NOT need a walkthrough though. I didn't use one. We see a system that was used in "Yesterday" by Pendulo Studios,another great game. Places change all the time and are extremely limited so NO, you'll not get bored, but even better the riddles can't be much complicated. Because space and spots are limited every time. It's like solving many mini adventure games. In "Yesterday" the limitation is greater. But in "Dark Eye" we have more space and wider choices. That complicates things more but it does NOT make them inevitable. But the riddles' difficulty is much greater after the smugglers' city. Try to focus on what you have to do and discard the places you were finished. That will make things clear. Still, the game's difficulty persists till the last chapter and that makes it annoying in the way of tiresome. You'll catch yourself telling "Enough,make a break at last. Let something easy...". But no. From the difficulty change spot to the last chapter the game will be that way. But the riddles are smart! THAT's why I'll call it a GOOD adventure that we miss these days!\n\nThe story is good. I will say that I haven't listened to it as a kid. But still... Fairy Tale. It has North signs like orcs and german ideology. You'll also see some sexism in it like Nuri the fairy to be half naked and that stuff. Sexy smiles,voices. The man that always tell lies to the girl. It's good. For me that I have heard a lot stories is ONE more. But the most of us we like to hear them same, right,especially women? What I was a little bit curious was the end. Very sort. I told myself "That was it? Finished?". Really sort end. Maybe "Memoria", the sequel, corrects this spot.\n\nSo a GREAT adventure is what that game is. One more fairy tale BUT challenging riddles after the mid point.\nTAKE it or leave it...","December 18, 2014","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's good. For me that I have heard a lot stories is ONE more. But the most of us we like to hear them same, right,especially women? What I was a little bit curious was the end. Very sort. I told myself "That was it? Finished?". Really sort end. Maybe "Memoria", the sequel, corrects this spot.\n\nSo a GREAT adventure is what that game is. One more fairy tale BUT challenging riddles after the mid point.\nTAKE it or leave it...","December 18, 2014","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First off, most of the voice acting really is not very good. The lead character's voice is very monotone, droll, and sounds like he just woke up. Some of the secondary characters are done well, however. Also, some of the puzzles are really, really obscure. This game will probably be good for those who are vey experienced with adventure games, but I would not recommend this to newcomers because of the frustration that some of the puzzles will cause.\n\nThe biggest issue for me is the ending. That's not to say that I'm dissatisfied with the final conclusion, but the ending sequence was literally as brief as "... the bad guy was defeated, and the hero went back to his home." Wait, what? I can't say anything else without spoilers; but for all of the questions that were created, you get no resolution and no explanation. You get a brief statement of what happened (literally just two scenes) and the game ends. Maybe some of those questions get answered in the sequel ("Memoria"), but as a standalone game I cannot express how disappointed I am in how the endgame story played out.\n\nStill, I have a soft spot for hand-drawn graphics, which make the entirely of the game. Most of the world is colorful and vibrant; and those areas that are bleak are indeed grey and miserable. The art in this game is nothing short of gorgeous, and some of the unlocked videos show how some of the backgrounds were drawn, giving you a new appreciation for how much work goes into the art direction of the game.\n\nSo, if you really like point-and-click adventures, this is worth your time. Just don't expect too much of an ending and don't expect a lot of humor. "Chains of Satinav" is a very dark game. If you are looking for humor, the "Deponia" games, also from Daedalic, are a much better choice.","February 22, 2014","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a beautiful old school point and click adventure game that keeps VERY true to its inspiration. The game looks nice and has an interesting, if not necessarily stellar, story, lots of puzzles, and loads of inventor items to fondle. If you like older adventure games like Lucasarts' classics than you should probably just go ahead and get this game. It doesn't quite have the humor those older games had, but the gameplay is much the same.\n\nUnfortunately, many of the irritating aspects of those older games are very present here. Many of the puzzles require a good deal of "inventory alchemy," so you'll often find yourself spending time listening to the main character repeating quips like "What am I thinking" a dozen times in a row as you try combining every one of your items with every other item in an attempt to figure out what arcane combination will yield a helpful result. Puzzles are also rather hit-or-miss. Most are fairly logical, but as you get closer to the end of the game they become increasingly convoluted until virtually all sense of reason is lost. I'm not ashamed to admit that there is simply no way I would have figured out that last few segments without a guide. If you can put up with these irritations, than there is a good game here, but it is very much a diamond in the rough.\n\nA note to achievement hunters: This game has some rather odd achievements for a point and click adventure game. First off, you will have to play the game multiple times to unlock everything (which I don't see any point in for this type of game). There are also a lot of achievements for performing arbitrary and time wasting actions like "click on this thing 10 times in a row." There is however, one interesting achievement I wish I had seen earlier. You can earn an achievement for using the "Hotspot Highlighter" less then 50 times in the course of a single play through.\n","January 15, 2014","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personally liked it, though I'd imagine it's not for everyone.  I do wish the animations during the chat scenes were a little less stilted.  All of the lines in the game have voice acting, which is a nice touch.  The majority of the voice acting is decent, though some of them sounded like they didn't want to bother with it.  The puzzles start out in a very logical fashion and can be figured out easily enough just by following the clues the game gives you if you pay attention to what's being said and what's going on around you.  Unfortunately, in my opinion that changes part way through the game, roughly about the time you enter the fishing town.  Suddenly you'll find yourself wandering back and forth repeatedly between the same few screens over and over frustratedly clicking everything in your inventory and speaking to the same characters for a thousand times to get that one oddball thing you missed.  This seems to build up to an incredible degree near the end of the game with what I found to frankly be the most bizarre puzzle solutions ever.  The spot near the end where you put the wizard hat upside down in the chandelier and dump a decanter full of wine into it...I was shouting "WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS???" at the screen.  It only sort of makes sense after you're already through the end of that puzzle, but come on, really?  When you reach the final "level", things get a little more straight forward again, but that's mostly due to the fact that you have almost no inventory and there's not a lot of things that are clickable or screens to move between.  In spite of this, I'd still say to give this a play through.  The story made it worthwhile in the end and I'm looking forward to giving the sequel, Memoria, a try.","January 26, 2014","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While you only get to know bits and pieces, it felt fleshed out and as if there were more there, and I kept hoping that I'd get to see/learn more about this world. The characters and world were engaging and interesting; I just really wish we could've seen more. While I love adventure games, I think this game would've been so much better as a 3rd-person rpg, like The Elder Scrolls or something. The puzzles ranged from easy to difficult, relying on common (gaming) sense, though sometimes stretching the range of logic and requiring pixel hunting and/or trying every combination. The art-style was quite pretty and charming, though the few times the game displayed cut-scene animations, the resolution would downgrade a significant amount-- I played the game at 1600x900 and the downgrade in resolution appeared to look like it was created for half that and then stretched, i.e. blurry and choppy.\n\nPerformance was an issue, which is weird because the computer I played the game on far exceeds the recommended requirements. It became more apparent when I'd play the game more than an hour or two, so I think there may have been some sort of memory leak problem or something. My other problem was the voice acting. The quality varied a lot, with some great and some terrible, but it was the two leads (Geron and Nuri) that were just irritating the hell out of me by the end. Now, Nuri's can be forgiven for her weird, breathy, whispery delivery because she's a fairy, and later on when you meet other fairies, you see they all speak like she does. So, while her VA is annoying, it at least makes sense within the story. Geron's VA doesn't have that excuse though. Most of the time it was as though the actor was just whispering in a mic with little to no emotion, or with saying something in a tone that seemed out of place for the situation (this is particularly glaring in the very last scene at the harp when he's talking with the raven).\n\nI would still recommend this game to fan's of the genre however, especially those who like the worlds of King's Quest and The Elder Scrolls.\n\nUpdate 12/14/14 - I finished the sequel, Memoria, and was not disappointed! The game was much improved in almost every way, with really only the performance and animations leaving more to be desired. I definitely understand now why people recommend playing this game first, and I totally back that-- it'll only help you better understand Memoria and make you feel more invested in the story of Geron and Nuri (and possibly make you cry). Chains of Satinav may not be as good as Memoria, but it's the first game in what is sure to be a great game series, and it's not a chore to get through, so I do still recommend playing it!","December 8, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, that's it!\n\nLet's take it from the start. When this game was published on Steam, I wanted to buy it like hell but I said that others will follow. Still liked it much. But as far as I played it proved to be a completely fairy tale, maybe a very good one, but still a fairy tale. No, I don't have problem with fairy tales. I like them, but because they're easy to be made all the companies and especially Daedalic Entertainment has made a lot. I have played many games from the company and I wish to play them all. But really, more than half of the games are fairy tales. I liked most "Lost Horizon" or the "Gray Matter","RunAway" and many more from other companies and "A New Beginning",maybe "Deponia"series to that matter from Daedalic. Those games have a background to the real world and in modern era they can be called sandboxes.. ANYWAY, to the game...\n\nGraphics are good. The engine here is similar to the "Night of the Rabbit" and I should say again, a great graphic engine for fairy tales. Yes, it makes them look good,really! Great colors,beautiful sketches, that kind of stuff. The only thing that made me curious is a setting about texture compression. It is the first game since many years now that ran without that setting that is a MUST to all 3D games in order for the game to run without delays. The opposite,when this setting was ON the game had delays. I don't know. Maybe the programmers have reversed settings by no means.. Really weird thing.  In my system I would say though that the game has some bugs because sometimes the characters vanished from screen and came in again in dialogues and some others after the first half of the game and NOT every time. Sometimes. I also had some dialogue problems when sometimes the game had another language spoken and no English. I had to translate in google to solve some riddles. But those were NOT enough to make me stuck. Another weak spot is the videos.You'll see sketches,drawn in hand and a voice to say a part of the tale in days that we could use 3D animation. All the videos are in the same style.\n\nThe sound is good and the music too. No complain here. The game has also a great soundtrack made of knightofsoundtrack.net. Really good music inside and the voices were ok if not excellent. So, if you are like me, be free to turn up your hi-fi connected to the PC and enjoy.\n\nRiddles and difficulty. Here we are at last. The game until you made it to the smugglers' city is just a walk. But from there and on the riddles become challenging. No,you'll NOT need a walkthrough though. I didn't use one. We see a system that was used in "Yesterday" by Pendulo Studios,another great game. Places change all the time and are extremely limited so NO, you'll not get bored, but even better the riddles can't be much complicated. Because space and spots are limited every time. It's like solving many mini adventure games. In "Yesterday" the limitation is greater. But in "Dark Eye" we have more space and wider choices. That complicates things more but it does NOT make them inevitable. But the riddles' difficulty is much greater after the smugglers' city. Try to focus on what you have to do and discard the places you were finished. That will make things clear. Still, the game's difficulty persists till the last chapter and that makes it annoying in the way of tiresome. You'll catch yourself telling "Enough,make a break at last. Let something easy...". But no. From the difficulty change spot to the last chapter the game will be that way. But the riddles are smart! THAT's why I'll call it a GOOD adventure that we miss these days!\n\nThe story is good. I will say that I haven't listened to it as a kid. But still... Fairy Tale. It has North signs like orcs and german ideology. You'll also see some sexism in it like Nuri the fairy to be half naked and that stuff. Sexy smiles,voices. The man that always tell lies to the girl. It's good. For me that I have heard a lot stories is ONE more. But the most of us we like to hear them same, right,especially women? What I was a little bit curious was the end. Very sort. I told myself "That was it? Finished?". Really sort end. Maybe "Memoria", the sequel, corrects this spot.\n\nSo a GREAT adventure is what that game is. One more fairy tale BUT challenging riddles after the mid point.\nTAKE it or leave it...","December 18, 2014","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is interesting enough to keep you going, and it well explains the strange title. (It really should be called Geron's Quest or something more generic than this title so deeply steeped in the lore of the game. It's a little too full of itself at times in the attempt to be an epic adventure story). The voice acting isn't bad, and the puzzles were decent.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiderbun/recommended/203830/","spiderbun","Miss.Spiderbun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiderbun/","29 products in account","I was very pleased to find this on sale for two dollars after I made the mistake of buying the sequel before the prequel. Especially when I was so eager for more story pertaining to the characters. What I got out of the game was very different in comparison to what I was expecting however. Maybe playing the second game led me to have higher standards both for the story and gameplay, but some things I really can't honestly believe there is a solid excuse for. I can forgive the horendously annoying waterfall effects that occur all over. I can forgive the occassional disappearing character. I can forgive the random occuring foreign text and audio cut out that requires me to fix things via the main menu.\n\nWhat I can't forgive makes me greatly wonder whether I would or would not suggest the game on a whole. Warning:: Spoilers ahead. Starting out, I'd have to say that the inability to tell Nuri she can rest for a while when using the moonlight magic irritates me. She's clearly in pain. Even if we are in a hurry, with how much Geron cares about her well being it doesn't seem like he would put her in such danger no matter how much he was in danger himself. He's made a bond with her at this point and you can't say it's shattered just because he's got a time frame on when the sad faries will return. With none of the sad faries inside and how somehow the one standing guard outside can't even hear Nuri or Geron talking to one another, it's already pushing a fine line. You can't just say that Nuri's using certain magic can make her ill or even die, then have Geron suddenly be okay with this risk despite all of his efforts to keep her alive.\n\nOn top of this there were many more errors that had completely flawed logic. Saying that you're worried about breaking off an arm on statues one second, but using the petrified animals as a hammer the next? Reiterating all the time how you can only break certain things, that you don't have a spell strong enough to break this and that. Then suddenly, oh why yes you can break an EYEBALL. Yes there was a hint that said 'it would need to be broken first' that came after trying to use the odd spraying plant, but it didn't suggest what in the world needed to be broken. I was left thinking the plant itself needed to be used to darken all of the mirrors and surfaces to darken the room like Nuri suggested, but clearly the world had other ideas in mind. An eyeball that is said to be alive in every way shape and form, shouldn't logically be able to be broken. Especially when you have no clue in the slightest of the mechanism behind the eyeball in an alternate fairy dimension.\n\nThen came the random 'growing and shrinking' waterfall. This had no visible signs of growing or shrinking anything as far as I could tell unless you randomly decided to put something in it. Which didn't in fact work on most things I attempted to put in there. It took many, many times of clicking in different ways for it actually to tell me how it apparently would grow things. I'm not entirely certain this wasn't something triggered by something I accidentally did either. Whatever the case, I was very unhappy with how long it took to discover the mechanism for how much I actually fiddled with it thinking I might be able to do something with no results other than negative comments from Geron. On this subject, I also tested the drawer in Geron's house similarly with different items. It was stuck, and everything told me that there was no way to get it out. I kept trying of course after he said it was the drawer the recipie I needed was in, to no avail. It was only after considering removing the top drawer entirely to try to get to the stuck bottom drawer that I accidentally came across Geron's notion that I would need something smaller to get the bottom out of the top drawer. 'An empty drawer doesn't need a bottom,' or something to that effect was what he said. With the way his house looked half ransacked, I really really honestly cannot see how on earth Geron came to be of this opinion? The drawers were on its side for goodness sake. Will we be removing the bottom of every drawer we want to leave empty now to show Geron we just want to have an empty drawer for empty drawer's sake now?\n\nThen, Geron didn't stop there with his mind boggling ways no. He decided he was going to break the logic of magic higher than his own by removing an artifact from an otherwise impenetrable force. Not with guidance of anyone at the academy, oh no. With completely random tossed together bits and pieces we had on hand. Sure it made sense how the things worked together, untilllllll it broke through the barrier that was said to only be broken through by the one who made it. Here I was thinking we'd have to wake the dead or cut off an arm to reach through to get it. Don't mind me wanting to follow the laws and respect all magical ways when no loophole was given anywhere.\n\nAfter getting the item so desired by the seemingly all knowing Raven, we then decide to use a word commonly spoken of in relation to the Seer. One would think we would choose a word more unlikely to be said by the seer or raven, because we're trying to make sure he can't activate it. Right? Later on the seer explains how he is untouched by Satinav, but it really doesn't justify the way their train of thought went before Geron was given this knowledge. In reality all the word does is serve to bring an end to everything in a way that the player would find pleasing. Not only this felt like very poor logic, but Nuri's almost complete nudity? I can understand that the harp as well as the bird probably tore her clothes away in this matter over time but, really? Is it really necessary to have the most precious character that we've already lied to and screwed over so demeaned? You couldn't have her looking pale and skinny as death without exposing her chest?\n\nNow, when it's all brought together. I do confess I very rarely used a walkthrough, but for the problems I faced I really didn't think I would need a walkthrough. The overall goal of the smaller missions and puzzles was clear, but the pieces it took to finish them was unclear. The struggle I was faced with throughout the game drew out the story much longer than I think was intended. I would have liked to say that the story was well paced such that the game itself was long, but it really was just being stuck trying to figure out the way the game's 'logic' wanted me to solve things. Even going so far as to include tedious word choice puzzles that required me to say very specific things to certain characters being so repetitive I almost gave up half the time. The story, made me feel closer to the characters but not in a way that made me feel I like knew the complete story? I would have liked to have gotten to know Nuri better. I did get attached to her, but everything Geron did pushed her away. From lying, sending her to do errands, using her tears and her body to 'save' her? For someone who kept insisting that he wanted her alive, he really did put her in situations I don't feel he should have. Something just feels largely missing from this, even with the sequel. I was unsatisfied.\n\nIf you want to live with a walkthrough on hand, or have the patience to take breaks in order to give your mind rest enough to think through the odd logic of the game I'd say have a go. I cannot say I would pay full price, but if you're daring enough go ahead. I for one would more often than not advise to either not buy the game or wait until it had the best of deals for you. The amount of art and time put into it is clear, but I really wish they'd given the logic a bit more thought. As even with all of the 'hotspots' and 'hints for what combinations work' on, everything was disorienting. The reasoning for this likely being they decided on assigning too many tasks at once, meaning too many items in the inventory to give options for every individual task.","February 11","false","26.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But then one weekend I stuble across a Daedalic sale and picked up this little gem for the grand total of 75p, and what a bargain it was; I'd have paid more.\n\nAt first the story seemed to suffer with the old "in a time of wibblesnaps a young faropos apprentice discovered a magical snaliff that threatened the good citizens of morhop" that you sometimes get with over the top fantasy, but eventually the story became quite immersive and enjoyable.\nThe voice acting also gave me a few concerns at first, the blacksmith especially, but I absolutely fell in love with the voice of Nuri and then some of the later characters with good baritone joined the cast. The relationship between Geron and Nuri as wonderful to watch unfold and I found myself investing emotionally in the characters and their quest. Truly the best part of this adventure is the wonderful tale it tells and the way it tells it.\n\nAnother good point to mention is the graphics. Although the character animations are a little bit wooden, you can easily see past them when you admire the beautiful backgrounds that make up the world they live in, lots of detail went into the world and I could easily spend my time seeing new things in the background and in some cases the foreground.\n\nAs for the puzzles they make up a nice learning curve that leave you satisfied when you solve them. I may have had to seek help on one occasion, but I put that down to tiredness due to me wanting to see what happens next. Apart from that they do seem to be logical puzzles until you visit the fairy realm, and even those aren't too difficult.\n\nTL;DR it's a good game buy it","August 31, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For me, it had the complexity of a King's Quest game, but without the messing-things-up-will-lead-to-your-death-and-failure, which made it easy to sit back and enjoy taking the puzzles at my own pace and not having to worry about having not picked up a mushroom in the last area or falling to my death accidently.\n\nThumbs Up's:\n+Great Story telling, you are looking for a good story you will enjoy this game greatly.\n+You can't die or mess up. You may struggle to find the solution, but you will never run out of time and have to worry about reloading the game or missing an item earlier on.\n+There's a good amount of play through, both in the player's own puzzling, but even in general content. I never felt like I cheated out of game play from cut corners.\n+Controls worked very nice and smoothly. I thought the inventory layout was easy to use and access. TIP: Also, by double clicking on an exit to another screen the player can skip walking animation which is helpful in some of the more twisted and roomier puzzles.\n+If you like snarky replies. Deaths are not allowed, so Geron will not do anything that will actually kill him, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have some funny, snarky quip to give you.\n\nThumb Middle's:\n-Not a lot of replayability right away, but it's like a good book. You need to have some space to forget a bit of the storyline and how all the puzzles work, but I can see myself coming back to play this game once again after a few months or a year - and I definitely plan too!\n\nThumb Down's:\n-I just don't have one for this game.

Negative points are that despite reading all the text carefully ... I still don't get what actually happened, the story of the Seer seems somehow jumbled. I'm not going to spill the beans here for those who haven't played it but it was confusing enough that I googled trying to get a story summary about the Seer - without success. That leaves me rather unsatisfied and the end was anti-climatic too in my eyes. I had a "Huh? That was it now??" moment for sure.\nWhat I would criticize too is a more common thing with Daedalus games: female characters are always ... sweet/helpless, ♥♥♥♥♥y/hysterical or plain keyword giver without any character. Chains of Satinav doesn't contradict that experience unfortunately. Still it isn't too obvious or bad and the atmosphere from art and soundtrack helps to overcome this complaint mostly for me. Overall I would recommend the game, if it came remastered with more cohesive storyline and figures/dialogues less cliche it would certainly add to it though.","August 14, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a sweet little game, with a compelling story and likeable characters. Like the other Daedalic games that I've played so far, it took me about 10 hours to complete, which is quite a nice length for a game of this type.\n\nIt's unique selling point, and one of the reasons that I enjoyed playing it so much, is that you have magic powers. The main character only has one power - to break things, such as glass. Later, you are also able to fix things. It is this constant mechanic that makes this game so interesting. It makes you think around a problem very differently - for example, you may need to break something in your inventory, then use it, and then fix it again to solve a puzzle. This, and other constant useful items such as the knife and the flint and steel, makes this game more of a proper adventure. I, with my trusty knife and my magical skills, can do anything. Well, almost anything. Some things.\n\nThe game does, however, have it's flaws. Some of the puzzles are, in my opinion, a little bit too obscure for their own good. This is mostly down to this game's tendency to give you too many items at once (that, and an inventory system which is quite difficult to navigate, rather than in Deponia, where it is possible to see all of your items at once). Too many things at once does make it a bit difficult to work out what you're supposed to use, and even if it doesn't, the solutions are not always the easiest to work out. I made it through most of the game without help, most of the puzzles were challenging, not impossible, but sometimes you just don't know what they're getting at, and still don't understand it after you've googled the solution. I don't know, I may just suck at point and click games. This is by no means a reason not to play it.\n\nThe achievement system is weird. You make certain choices throughout the game, which don't affect the story much but do get you certain achievements (if you're bothered about that). The problem is, it's not just that you MISS achievements (there're some which it might not occur to you to try to get), you CAN'T get all of them in one playthrough. The achievement system contains alternative achievements, for each and every way of doing something. This is a little odd, but it isn't really important.\n\nThe main disappointment for me was the ending. There was nothing wrong with it, in itself - but it was abrupt. I had the same problem with Deponia (although the ending there was slightly less fulfilling). You complete the game, and then... it's just over. A little bit of a trailoff, but it doesn't hang around to say goodbye. There IS a second game to play - but, unlike Deponia, it isn't just a continuation of the same story. This story ended, and I felt a little cheated of closure at the end. Not much - and maybe it's because I was just sad to finish playing it - but there were a couple of loose ends, to say the least.\n\nNo matter, I'm greatly looking forward to the next game. Hopefully it will fill in some of the gaps. The Daedalic bundle is a great buy on sale (mostly just for Deponia and this, and maybe another game or two), I'm very quickly becoming a big fan of this company.","January 6","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of the clues are far too vague or don't make sense. Sometimes it seems like they did not even give a clue about some of the things required that you do. In many parts of the game it devolved into a tediuos series of trial and error experiments.  I know this happens in a lot in point and click adventures and I wish all developers would just give proper clues and quit trying to make the game longer or more difficult for no good reason. I bet they would get a lot more people to play these kind of games. The hand drawn backgrounds are great. Some of the animations seem like they could be better but it wasn't bad by any means. I have seen people say they didn't like the voice acting or the main character but I thought it was fine. I found myself really enjoying the story. I always tried to figure out what to do on my own but like I said I used the walkthough a few times and the game took me about 17 hours. I think that is a good amount of entertainment for a game like this. Overall I recommend this game and I already bought Memoria to continue the adventure.","May 30","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game did not disappoint.  Very impeccibly done scenes with amazing detail.\nSecond attraction: interesting universe (although somewhat formulaic)\n\nAnd now for the negatives:\n\nI really wanted to love this game as others did too but in the end I found myself forcing to finish it...which is always a bad sign.  My major complaints are more systemic to Daedelus as a developer than anything.  I have played many games of theirs...favourite thus far is Deponia series.\n\nVoice acting aside from narrator is atrocious.  I played most of the game with the voice off.  This is actually kind of funny...but I kept encountering a bug where after 30min+ of play, voices would cut out.  On top of being unacceptable in a normal game, I got used to it because the voice acting added nothing for me.  I think this is in part of possibly the actors being non-native English speakers but for me, the pacing, the emphasis, the mispronunciation drove me nuts.  It is a really bad sign when a player cannot stand the voice of the two main characters.  Same problem happened in Whispered World.\n\nGame engine needs to be SCRAPPED.  It shouldn't take 3 minutes from executing the game to start playing.  The framerate is horrendous.  Saving/Loading takes forever.  Switching scenes takes forever.  I have a high-end system.  These things shouldn't happen.  I had the same compliants in ALL previous adventure games by Daedelic.  I feel like I am playing an adventure game from the early 2000s.  Scrap it!!!\n\nAt this point, I probably won't be playing any more Daedelic games until these types of issues are resolved.","May 29","false","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They could have cut the beginning half shorter.\n- An interesting mechanic that involves breaking and/or fixing objects using magic.\n- Some very uninituitive puzzles, occasionally, but nothing surprising for fans of the genre.\n- A less than 2 minute ending that is somehow satisfying.\n\nThe reason I played through was because I heard that the sequel, Memoria, was excellent. I hope it's worth it.","June 1","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
