Nailed the platformer/flapper feel. Played with my kids taking turns. Really enjoyed playing. Can't wait to see it get bigger err well we can't get too far yet but we will crush it.","November 5, 2015","true","21.7"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","0"

The levels aren't easy, so there's a real sense of satisfaction when you completethem. However, the levels aren't easy, so there's also a real sense of SADisfaction when you fail twenty times in a row. Sorry about the pun, it's a coping mechanism.\n\nIf there's one tweak I'd suggest, it would be a second or two of celebration after completing a level, rather than abruptly being thrust into the next level with no fanfare. Come on, game designers, stroke our pathetic egos.","November 24, 2015","true","5.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","10","11","5","0"

However, it is quite fun and has a very enjoyable soundtrack. Simple concept and gameplay, but not the easiest thing in the world. I would definitely recommend this game.
