If you are looking for top of the line graphics you are not going to find it here.  Also, this game is not simple.  If you want simple there are tons of Flappy Bird clones out there... But Darkwind is definetly not going to be for you.  Quite simply, Darkwind is not a game for everyone.  But... The people that it is for will be blown away and will wonder "WHY DID I NEVER HEAR OF THIS GAME BEFORE NOW"\n\nDarkwind is a bit hard to describe, but if I would have to put it in one phrase it would be this:  Darkwind is a Turn Based MMO Mad Max Gang simulator on permenant "Iron Man" mode with a nice physics engine and a whole slew of vetrarn players who would much, much, rather spend time helping you than PVPing you into the ground.\n\nPretty much if you would rather play X-COM than COD, or Civ over Halo, or Jagged Alliance over Starcraft 2, you really should check this game out.","August 22, 2014","true","606.1"," 115 of 147 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","115","147","0","12"

The landscapes are terrible, even for post apocalyptica, the cars are really simple, and the UI is downright terrible. Visually it really has nothing going for it. Even the sound is somewhat irritating.\n\nBUT, you don't play this for aesthetics... You play it because of the amazing physics rich turned based combat/racing. Once you get used to the UI, this game really starts to shine. At the start of each turn you change steering, gears, weapon targetting, etc. and once it's all set watch the next 3-4 seconds play out. This gets hectic when you're racing against a large group of players.\n\nThe real beauty lies in how each action follows through subsequent turns. Made that hard right a little too hard? the next 3-4 turns will be spent countersteering, and when it works... oh boy does it work. Pulling off successful drifts, jumps, etc gives you a real sense of accomplishment. Combined with terrain realistically affecting your cars handling and you have racing that equals any AAA racing simulators.\n\nI've been playing this on and off for the past 4 years, so don't let the steam counter fool you. I highly recommend at least trying this out. Once you get past the unfriendly UI and get to the actual racing, you'll have a hell of a time.","August 22, 2014","true","12.2"," 62 of 91 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","62","91","0","1"

The game is also turn based, so it's expected to be slow - idiots that have a problem with it shouldn't really review a game that they don't like just because it's turn based. The game is rather simple to get in, you get a vehicle, you mount guns on it, you assign crew to it. One drives, other shoots. Or even the driver can shoot if you like. Unfortunately a few mechanics of the game aren't explained, the only way to get to know the unexplained mechanics are through community interaction, like demoralising - how does it work, you just have to ask. But the basics aka the driving/shooting is explained in a short tutorial. The game doesn't have any bugs as far as I seen, you shoot at others - they recieve damage depending on from which side you shot. You take damage if you get shot at, you damage tyres if you do too sharp turns, you damage your armor if you ram into a wall.\n\nAnother thing is permakill feature in this game, which isn't that much of a feature used in newer games. If your crew dies - you have to hire a new one. If your car is destroyed, it's destroyed. No fixing it. I myself like permakill feature in games, makes it more tedious when you're playing against a player (You mostly play against bots in this game however.) and you have to be more careful with your turns.\n\nSo yes, the game works, it's good, but it doesn't look good because it's a game from year 2007. Other than that, you can get rich and good without investing a buck into it - just "roll" a scout with other players, get new cars. Sell them or keep them. Your crew gets experience and get better the more encounters they survive.\n\nHowever, once you get rich and can take on any encounter, the game begins to be rather boring - there isn't anymore to do other than maybe fight other rich players for their cars. But it is fun till then, and that can be more than 100 hours.\n\nMost that review this game negatively are just casuals who can't handle losing their first car, really. The community is friendly as hell, and they will even give you a car if you ask nicely enough.","July 18, 2015","true","43.5"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","21","28","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/recommended/295710/","shoggofu","YouTube shoggofu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/","257 products in account","First of all this is a 2007 title and it look’s like it, not that that necessarily means that it’s completely bad. I’ve ‘played’ it for around an hour and 45 minutes. I say ‘played’ because I spent I most of my time in the menu trying to figure out how to start playing the game, the game decides not to work half the time. I was eventually able to complete a whole match which I enjoyed.\n- If you aren’t a really patient person, don’t a lot of time on your hands and don’t like turn based games you should probably skip this\n- You actually control your vehicles movement by using manipulating the steering wheel and with the physics your car can spin out of control, I thought that was really cool\n\nhttp://youtu.be/zTG_6Tv9VsU\nhttp://youtu.be/hQxOhW8nMn8\nSo at first I had no problem getting into the a couple of tutorial matches, You just need to click on the big tutorial button in the middle of the menu. The tutorial tips missed certain points like the fact that you need to destroy the car on the other side of the map to end the first tutorial. Also after my three attempts at completing the tutorials I initially couldn’t get into them again even though in the menu I was told that the tutorial would be starting.\n-----I thought the way you control your car is cool. It took me a while to work it out. You don’t actually just click where you want your vehicle to go. You actually need to change the position of a steering wheel and throttle by dragging them with the mouse or using the arrows keys. So it’s sort of like a simulation of real controls. The game indicates where your car will move to after you end your turn. When you end your turn a few seconds will pass and the vehicles move, a little bit… lol. You have to complete a lot of turns in order to cover substantial distances, because vehicles will only progress bit by bit. You will need to adjust your throttle and steering most turns in order to avoid hazards or losing control and to navigate the environment.\n-----I thought this was really cool. Your car will spin out of control if you just lock the steering wheel and max out the throttle, and stuff like that. I think going inclines can cause your car to flip too, I didn’t put that to the test yet. You can also drift and go over jumps.\n-----Vehicles will have different guns equipped depending on their model, I think you can also customize the loadout. Guns can be on the front, back or sides of vehicles. Drivers only appear to be able to fire front guns. But you are able to have passengers gunning weapons in the other locations.\n-----I had to figure out how to use weapons, I didn’t see any instructions. You have to fiddle around a fair bit. You need to open the management tab found to above of the throttle and steering wheel controls. Click on the weapon then the occupant you wish to assign as the gunner. If you can’t assign a gunner to a weapon it may be because it’s a melee weapon used for ramming. If it is a projectile weapon click on the weapon in the management tab again to see the firing arc and select a target by left clicking it. Then after one turn you will have the option to set the weapon to fire one time only or every turn until you say so. The weapon will fire when it’s target is in it’s firing arc, which may require many turns of repositioning to achieve.\n-----So that’s what I did for the first 20-30 minutes, the tutorials. So then I wanted to get stuck into the game, I wasn’t sure how it worked. I thought it would be like an open world but you actually just appear to join events such as death-races or arena combat. I think there is actually on foot combat events for you gang members as well as vehicular combat. The game makes reference to a number of towns but I have no idea how this all works i.e. how you go to them.\n-----I was initially very confused about how to actually join one of these matches, it probably didn’t help that I was tired. Anyway what you are supposed to do is click on an upcoming event, the list is pretty much in the middle of the main menu. Sometimes nothing happened when I did this, which is one of the reasons I had so much trouble getting into a match. I think this might have been because of connection or server, sometimes I was disconnected without realizing it. There is no connection status indicator or sound played on disconnect and and it’s easy to miss server messages with all the chat going on. Clicking login seemed to fix this problem sometimes. Unfortunately doing so while you actually already have a connection will kick you and make you wait 30 seconds until you can reconnect.\n-----Anyway if things are working properly, clicking on an event in the list should bring up a menu. Click register and then then scroll down and click register again. This should add you to the list of competitors. In each match that I joined everyone seemed to be given a stock car. Once the countdown timer has reached about 3 minutes you will be able to enter the event by clicking play game in the same window. You can leave this window before this but you may have trouble finding it again if there are different events with similar names. For some reason a lot of events have very long countdown timers, sometimes over an hour. You will probably want to choose one that has only a few minutes to wait.\n-----I have successfully joined and completed one ‘race’. There were initially two other player controlled vehicles. The other ten vehicles or so were AI controlled. Every human player needs to repeatedly end their turn in order for the game to progress, otherwise you can be sitting there waiting forever. I think all players were first timers like me. All the vehicles literally gradually inched along as the players locked in their turns. Although it was a race surprising at like turn 28 half way through the first lap, weapons went hot. So missiles began flying everywhere, but everyone quickly ran out of ammo. After around half an hour and I think about 150 turns, I think I came 5th which should have earned me a reward. But my car just disappeared and I returned to menu before the last cars finished. I didn’t see a results screen. I later joined a combat arena match but for some reason I was disconnected.\n-----You can buy and sell vehicles and items from NPCs and other players. I didn’t do anything with that, it doesn’t seem to be necessary for a new player.\n-----I started with five gang members. They crew you vehicles and have different stats making each of them suited to specific roles including driving and gunning. Again I haven’t played for long enough to see how this affects the game. I just allowed gang members to automatically be assigned to positions in my vehicles.\n-----There is also what look's like some form of scenario editor which I didn't really get a chance to look at properly.\n\nSo yes the game has 2007 graphics. But honestly they do the job. The textures are pretty basic, but the physics are cool. The cars bounce around on their suspension when they go over uneven terrain etc.\n-----The main problem is really with the interface in the menu. There is no indication when you are disconnected from the server. There is no status indicator for events that you have requested or registered for once you have left the event registration window.\n\nSo yeah they game is old but I don’t really care about the graphics. I actually really wanted to get stuck into the gameplay because I liked it. But with server issues and stuff the game just made it hard for me to actually play it. If you can join events with friends, I would like to do that. But I’m not even sure that you can at this stage. If I can get the game to work reliably I think I would like to spend more time playing it.\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","August 22, 2014","true","6.5"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","0"

So ignore my current played time listed.\n\nBefore giving this game a shot, you need to take note that this is no fast paced twitch based shooter like you'll usually see on Steam. Give the wiki a read and take a look at some of the introduction guides and videos.\n\nKEEP IN MIND! There are ALOT of issues popping up with the Steam release that should be fixed in the next few days. Give it some time aswell.\n\nDont jump on the hate bandwagon because of the graphics. Look past that and at the gameplay, physics and fun you can have.\nThis game is something you'll love if you enjoy turn based combat with wonderful physics. Tabletop games and pen and paper RPG's.\n\nHalf of the negative reviews shown so far are from people who didnt bother checking the guide or asking questions in chat.\nPeople load in, dink around in options and think "Oh, this isnt fun. I dont have anything to do." They dont bother asking questions, reading up on the game and just scoff "This game is awful" before leaving.\n\nIs the learning curve steep? Yes.\n\nBut, there is hope. I joined up just as confused as most of you. I took a wee bit of time to read up on things and gave a race a try. I then asked a few questions and quickly got assisted by some of the vets.\n\nIf half of you would take the time to ask some questions, play a few scouts with some good people and actually get a taste of the game I'm sure you'd either enjoy it or hate it.\n\nBut thats exactly the problem. Most people will join this game and assume you can get right into the action. Get mad because they cant figure out what to do, troll around in the chat for a few then run back to TF2.\n\nAgain... Give the guides a read and dont be afraid to talk in chat and ask us questions. We can gladly help you.\n\nAll I ask is before you post a review is do more than just dink around in the client for 6 minutes silently before logging off. Speak up and let someone ingame show you how this is meant to be played. Then base your review off this.\n\nKeep in mind aswell that Sam and the crew are busy making the transition to Steam aswell during all this and doing his best to fix all the problems popping up and give you an\nenjoyable experience.\n\nHugs and Kisses xoxo\n\n-Herzen","August 22, 2014","true","173.2"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

I keep coming back to it off and on and everytime I do I get hooked for awhile again! This game has alot to offer. Many different ways to play it.\n\nI can understand why some people are turned off by it. I remember when I very first tried it I thought how the hell could turn based car racing be fun. I thought of racing as flying around at breakneck speed dipping and dodging around an intricate racetrack. Let me tell you though... this aint the case! Its alot of fun and I personally think more games should be like this. Youve alot of time to try to line up perfect turns and manuevers and when things go bad (as theyy often do with the way I drive) its great to see it unfold turn by turn.\n\nThe other thing that I hear alot of people dissing the game about, especially since the steam release, is the steep learning curve. Ive been playing for a long time and I still learn new ♥♥♥♥ all the time. On that same note: Im pretty acclimated to the way everything works so Im probably the wrong person to make an observation on this point. I can tell you though, If you stick around long enough to learn the ropes, this is an awesome strategy game.\n\nAnother great thing about this game is the community. The vets that Ive had the pleasure of sharing this game with are extremely helpful. Even the developer plays with us occasionally. Everyone tries to help new people too. I couldnt even begin to calculate the number of times someone has helped me out with a vehicle or a quick shot of cash when I was down on my luck. Or the times I had a stupid question I was embarrased to ask in public only to have everyone chime in to help me understand.\n\nIn short this is a great game and Ill be playing it for as long as the servers are up! So see ya in the wasteland!","August 26, 2014","true","0.4"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It is based on the tabletop board game Car Wars of old. That means turn based, patient gameplay. You will need to be willing to give this game a significant amount of your time if you want to get the most out of it.\n\nFirst let me get the bad points out of the way; the UI isn't particularly friendly to new players, the graphics are very dated and you may come across the occasional bug in the game.\n\nThat said, the pros vastly outweigh the cons. The community in this game is the best that I have seen from ANY online game. This goes a long way to counteract the hard-to-get-to-grips-with game client. Most people are happy to answer any questions that new players have (and there tends to be a lot of those) and specifically appointed 'marshals' (identified by a username parenthesised by '*'s) are experienced with the game and will take new players out on scouts.\n\nThe depth of the gameplay in Darkwind is also second to none, and that is to the credit of the game's lone developer *Sam*. Premium players can have a gang filled with over 50 characters depending on the skill of their leader (mine currently has 57) and each character will be different depending on the skills you train them in. These characters can then be sent out on scouts, travel to different towns or used in town events. The perma-death in this game also makes you actually care about your characters, and mourn them when they're gone - because the aren't coming back.\n\nI've rage quit a few times, stopped playing for months because I've lost characters that were dear to me. But I always come back, because the game is worth it. This is a game that is constantly updated by a developer who cares not only for the game but for the community. Give it a chance and it'll reward you with an emotional rollercoaster and a drain on both your time and your resources. Don't blame me if your wife leaves with the kids because you are spending too long on this game after getting hooked.","September 2, 2014","true","98.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This game was fun, but its turn based Deathrace mechanics with AI that takes a few seconds to go (130 turns for the first place finisher on a single lap loop) adds up. The game is facinating, but poorly delivers on its premise. You queue up for races that have upcoming start times which becomes downtime while you wait for the next event to begin. The most distracting aspect is how often the game loads the steam browser to faciliate aspects of the game rather than handling it within the client.\n\nThis game is interesting, bring friends to laugh with you, but avoid if you are trying it out solo.","November 17, 2014","false","1.0"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

First, the gameplay is actually quite fun, I like it's turn based things, because that was unique to me. When it says "Think a few moves ahead" you really need to. I went into a turn, not planning the next 3 moves for the turn. I ended up hitting a wall, and stopping the whole race. One of my friends taught me the game, i'm just basically figuring out how to scout. Secondly, people say that switching through the web browser and through the game is quite stupid. If your lazy (like all the people who disliked because of that) this isn't your game. I was happy to learn that when you have no more gang members, its not game over, unless you have no money, which basically will not happen. The tutorial does give information about driving, which is helpful, but seek controls and help with other things, you just ask people. This is why I reccommend the game. Friend me.

It is also has a very unfriendly user interface and learning curve.\n\nThe game is turn based, if you want to hop in a car, drive around however you want in real time, and blow stuff up, then go check out the Twisted Metal series or stuff like that, this isn't that.\n\nThe graphics are old and not very good but functional.  The number of vehicles and weapons are pretty limited, even though this game has been live and active for years.  The gang and vehicle management is done via the website that is opened in an external browser.  The Free 2 Play aspects are not so limiting to a free player that you can't enjoy the game without having to pay as you get access to the 3 first major towns and most of the events take place there.\n\nSo why the recommend? Gameplay.  If you are looking for a turn based Car Wars type game with real physics, this is your only option and a decent one.  I prefer turn based games that allow you to succeed via your wits not your twitch reflexes.  Again, the appeal for this game will be limited to a niche group, but if you feel that might be you, it is free to download and give it a try.","August 22, 2014","true","0.3"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

I've been playing Darkwind for a long time before it came to Steam.  If you've played the table top game Car Wars, Darkwind is based loosely on this.  Turn based, but flows like real time pausable, you control a Mad Max style gang and watch them grow, train, become famous or infamous, get older if they're lucky, and eventually retire or die.  The cars/trucks that you aquire and equip with better and better weapons will enable you to reach deeper in the wastelands and eventually get even better gear... or end in complete financial disaster for your gang.  This game is a battle-game, RPG, financial simulator, all in one in a radiated distopian future.  If you've down voted this game, you haven't given it a proper chance to mature in your brain.  If you enjoy click fests, or first person shooters and nothing else, then move along.

Todays folks are used to sh*t they've seen already thousand times (COD LOL) and are not ready for something way more different, specific, complex and unforgiving like Darkwind. I used to play this game many years ago, when restrictions were so tight, you couldn't even own a car, nevertheless, with steam release, those limitations were removed and you get humongous amount of free content.\n\nPros:\n+ Dynamic gameplay\n+ Complex trading and faction system\n+ Joining factions\n+ Unforgiving (when it comes to dying and losing cars)\n+ Long-Term\n+ Creating camps (didnt even get to that)\n+ Loads of chasseses (is that even a word?), weapons and engines to combine\n+ Turn-based (love it)\n+ Free to play\n\nCons:\n- UI (for some people might be unbearable, you'll get it eventually)\n- If you want all the stuff, you need to get premium (however, you can happily play without it and reach skyhigh)\n\nJust a little warning for all of you, this game causes a serious rage-quitting issues (parental advisory :D)","February 14, 2015","true","237.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

For starters, its a great community of players, and the Developer, Sam often takes player's input, art, and literature and implememnts it into the game. If you ever played Car Wars, this game is for you. There is a tremendous amount of things to do in the game. You can concentrate on the many town events such as Deathracing, Racing, Arena Combat,, and Pedestrain Combat, or you can wander out into the wastelands seeking wealth and fame, looting prized vehicles and weaponry. You can also manage your gang member's skills, specialisms, and even try and curve their bad drug habits by sending them to rehab.\n\nThe game has several unique features, one of which is Permadeath. If your gang is fighting a bad battle, sometimes you have to ask yourself if it might be better to try and outrun your opponents rather than lose that prized gunner of yours... Also this game is turn based, so if your looking for constant button pushing in a short period of time, this game is not for you.\n\nLastly, what this game lacks in graphics is made up in game depth. Don't download this game and play it for 2 minutes and base your opinion on the graphics, or you are going to miss out on a great game.","August 29, 2014","true","661.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Don't expect to just hop into the game and understand the lobby or interface without asking questions in lobby chat or researching. Most of the veteran players are very friendly and helpful so don't be afraid to chat them up if you do decide to give it a shot.\n\nIf you just want to play for free, you have nothing to lose. Only real limitation on free to play is you are stuck in Somerset, the beginning town. My guess is you will find this game entertaining for about a month or two of daily gaming if it is your cup of tea. If it isn't, you won't make it much farther than the tutorial before you uninstall.\n\nPositives:\n- Scouting is very fun, especially with other veteran players.\n- The game is hardcore and you can lose your vehicle(s) and gang quite easily, especially if you scout solo. It is not an easy or forgiving game, especially with unskilled gangers.\n\nNegatives:\n- Huge time investment to skill up gangers, to go scouting, to do pretty much anything.\n-The developer of this game, Sam, has moved on to bigger and better things. There will probably be no more content added to the game, there are skills like cycling that your characters have but cycles aren't even in the game and probably never will be put into the game. Do not spend any money on this game if you are hoping for serious improvements or ANY additional content added in the future. It is highly unlikely.\n- The game is very time consuming no matter what you do. Scouting takes a very long time usually and if you decide to do events, there are specific times when events in each town start so you may have to wait an hour or more for a specific event to start. Yes, you can start your own events once every 30 minutes, but the rewards are much less than the ones that are on timers.\n- There is a bug where the npc vehicles can shoot through the ground/terrain and hit you and when you shoot at them, you shoot the ground. You think you have positioned yourself in a good spot, only to get damaged or even killed due to this bug. VERY VERY ANNOYING OR EVEN GAME BREAKING. Why has this not been fixed? Probably because Sam doesn't care about this game anymore as he is too busy working on mobile games now.\n\nMy ratings from 1(lowest) to 10(highest)\n\nGraphics - 5\nSound - 4\nGameplay/Control - 7\nLongevity/Playability - 6\n\nOverall Score - 6","December 1, 2015","false","351.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","3"

It feels a lot like my old tabletop car wars days in the 80s, but after a month of trying and actually buying into the premium content I cannot recommend it to anyone that doesn't have a very high tolerance for abuse if not being an outright masochist.\n\nThe game has potential, but it's broken in too many ways. It's AI is so stupid that to give the AI a fighting chance many events will have players so outnumbered that there is no way they could carry enough ammo to deal with all the targets.\n\nOn top of the shoddy AI, it's riddled with bugs, some totally game breaking and many which will result in the losses to the player, and the developer is a full time college professor so he's really not putting any time into dealing with the game abusing players or even to fix the bugs or finish including content that was clearly planned from day 1.\n\nAfter three major losses to bugs, once to a driver dying and a ride being almost totally trashed because the front scraped the ground on a bump... a bus suddenly launching into the air and landing on it's side... and today an encounter 'Trucing' (meaning you supposedly made peace and avoid the conflict) not once but twice and then still making me fight it, in all costing me far too much to just dismiss as "Meh, stuff happens."\n\nAlso, it's very unfriendly and borders on pay to win.\n\nCan't recommend it, tired of feeling abused by it, not expecting it to get any better anytime soon, and done giving it any of my time.\n\nIf you decide you are thick skinned and highly tolerant and want to try it anyway, I highly recommend not paying a dime into the premium content until you have gangers that have months of training under their belt because the premium content is not for new characters and most of the veteran players there will just ridicule you if you complain... Heck, they will ridicule you if you bring up bugs, because the game has a large number of callous fanboys that think it's perfect in it's currently buggy (but apparently very exploitable by experienced players) condition.\n\nPS: The icing on the cake for my leaving and where the real need to be thick skinned lies is in the Troll riddled community. There are a handful of fanboys that will simply troll anyone they don't like out of the game... When I tried to discuss the issues the main heart of the review focuses on in their technical forum I got flamed for pages, one of the flamers following me to a forum post here on Steam and generally the last straw was a toxic community around the game and once again a developer that simply does not care about what is actually going on with his game.","October 1, 2014","false","22.0"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

Gr8 driving mechanics, graphics to rival Star Citizen. A huge open world bigger than Skyrim. A gr8 Mad Max style setting. A story which I was hanging off every word of the quest givers dialogue, also has a rich backstory. Your build relationships with everyone of your gang members and all of them are useful when doing anything. It contains a fantastic first person mode and you can even target the guns from this view! The scenery is beautiful and includes, deserted skyscrapers, huge termite mounds in the desert that stretches as far as the eye can see. There are no microtransactions so I have no idea how this game came to be. If you build a team of other players you can combine and a transformers/power rangers style way to take down whole buildings in one hit and then you get to see the levelution.\n\nIn short this game is the best of all time it perfectly combines the gameplay aspects from driving games, shooters, MMOs, RPGs and open world games.

But for a game to come out in 2014 in this style is unacceptable. This game would be descent if there was an easier matchmaking system that is inviting.

Seemed good, the tutorial got me interested, but the lack of people playing means not many games are being set up.  On top of this if you sit idle for five minutes the Server drops you and you must wait 30 second to log back in.  This gets old, fast.  I wasn't able to get to the gameplay because of the lack of players wanting to start the game.\n\nEdit: On top of this review I've been getting flamed/trolled by people that play the game because I wrote this review!

This is not innovative and it is repetitive to say the least, heck I only played for 6 minutes and I was already bored. The music is in one word awful. Graphic on cars can be considered passable at best. The environments and textures are laughable. We shouldn't accpept bad games just because they're free. The best possible way i can descibe this game is so bad that it will make you laugh for a few minutes. If you are looking for a decent free game with more appealing gameplay and charm I suggest the Expendabros or You Have to Win The Game.

I wanted to like this game, I love the theme, the apparent table top inspired gameplay, the apparent depth... but there's just nothing here.\n\nFirst and foremost the UI is absolutly atrocious and painful to navigate. Menus hidden within menus, and none of it is very intuitive. This alone is unlikely to deter most potential players and if it was the only issue then it would be forgivable, however it merely sets the stage.\n\nThe fundamental flaw of this game is the gameplay itself. It is a lie. There is no depth here.\n\nThe gameplay is divided between events like racing and arena combat and then patroling which is where you will salvage vehicles and supplies.\n\nIn a patrol evry combat encounter will play out exactly the same regardless of what vehicle you have. You will spawn into the map, the enemy will spawn behind you or facing you directly. If they spawn behind you, then you run, spin, form a firing line with the other players and then shoot as the enemy comes into range. If they spawn in front of you, you form a firing line and shoot as they come in range.\n\nRegardless of whether your car is a fast muscle car or an armor-plated SUV the tactics are the same. The physics in this game are pretty good, and if they actually gave the vehicles some decent speed and acceleration, and if the maps themselves and the enemy spawns where different then you could make use of the physics and actually take a tactical approach to the situation, but it is here that the game sabatoges itself. The encounters are lazy line battles and it gets lame quick.\n\nThe races  have more to do with luck than the skill of the "driver" because there will inevitably be a giant crash and the winner is whoever manages to avoid it with the least loss of control.\n\nThe death races are equally lame because they present little in the way of strategy. Once again it is mostly luck. Pulling ahead means you got shot in the rear by everyone behind you, hanging back means you run out of ammo after dispatching one racer. The best choice is to hang neck and neck with the drivers in the middle pack and hope those behind you target the adjacent races, meanwhile exploiting the firepower of those next to you in order to take out those in the lead. If you are very lucky then those behind you engaged other targets and those next to you are now too low on ammo to destroy you as you try to pull ahead.\n\nIf the races were not all stock then perhaps some skill and much needed variety could be injected, as it is now though in an attempt to make things "fair" everyone is given the same vehicle and loadout and so we are left with a complete and utter mess.\n\nApparently this game has a deep player driven economy and a few other features I missed because they are divided betweem the browser side of the game and/or hidden somewhere in the UI.\n\nThis game has been out for a long while now, it still looks like crap, plays like crap, and shows no intention of fixing the core issues.\n\nThe community is atually quite pleasant, though some of the more well known players and GMs are passive aggressive ♥♥♥♥♥.","January 16, 2015","false","38.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I respect that it may be under develpoment and with the help of updates the clunkiness will disappear, however i just feel that the idea of the game being turn-based will not work, maybe if the turns were longer it might be enjoyable but as it is the game doesn't seem like it will work. Many things seem promising, but the lack of flowing gameplay and combine that with the frankly poor menu i feel the game will need a lot of work because it is truly playable/\n\nP.S I don't mean for this review to be to scathing, but i just feel the game could be so much better than it is, not just if it had more time I think the developers just need to take a step back  and think about where their going with the game.","December 7, 2014","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to look at what everyone else is doing, and think 3-5 moves ahead. If you like chess, or turn based games, you owe it to yourself to give this a try because there is nothing else like it. I'm hoping for a remake with a better UI and graphics, because I would play this forever !","August 29, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great game.\nDarkwind is a game following a society deathracing and fighting in a post-apocalyptic world. Although some of the stuff is hard to get used to, you soon find a nice group of friendly members and people who've been playing since it was a board game to help you.\n\nGood stuff time.\nFighting cars. What's not to like? Drive your tiny little family car into the side of a pickup and flip it over. The driver then gets otu and is instantly squished by another flurry of flames and wheels. Your gunner is forced to donate blood by the shrapnel that comes off your left plating, but manages to keep shooting. Great.\n\nThe community is a nice one. No noobs going 'AHH I HATE THIS GAME I CAN'T EVEN PLAY IT ARGH IM NOW GONNA SPAM UNTIL SOMEONE FEELS THE SAME AS MEEE'. Instead, the noobs are asking the vets what to do, and the vets are helping. That never happens anywhere else.\n\nThere are a load of things to do in the cars. You can go scouting, which involves drving in a little team through the desert until you find something worth shootin'n'lootin'. Although it seems a little confusing at first (See cons) you can really feel like part of the society quickly.\n\nNow, bad time.\n\nAlthough the game is both complete and spanking new, the User Interface is terrible. You cannot easily find some crucial things, like scout parties and vehicle shops. I have yet to fully work out where some stuff is.\n\nThat is basically all the bad things.\n\n9.5/10 Great job.","September 1, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's quite unique in just about any way. I don't know of any other  turn based full physics vehicular combat MMO. It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea, and unfortunately the community is slowly dying.\n\nI remember the joy of getting my first Buzzer and the subsequent frustration when it was blown up two missions later.\n\nI remember setting a teammate's expensive Ambulance on fire by accident and watching it blow up a few turns later. They never talked to me again.\n\nThe memories I made in this game are priceless, and was well worth the cost of strugging to learn how to play and almost losing everything during the first few hours of my gameplay.\n\nThis game had a lot of potential.
