The play space moves, it's slow, so not terrible, but it's not great for more than 15mins play. Especially when looking in a different direction than the velocity is heading. FLoating disc under the player doesn't help also, it rotates with in your lower periphery.\n2. Audio is not spacialised, it gives no clues as to which direction zombies are in and how far away. The audio in general feels pretty weak.\n3. Weapon feels like it needs a 20 degree tilt to match how you would comfortably hold a vive controller and match other shooting games.\n4. Switching weapons is pretty awkward, grabing from over the shoulder would feel much nicer. Just because the controller has buttons doesn't mean you need to use them.\n5. Hit effects need some work, the animation and particle effects don't seem to fire on every hit. Makes weapons feel less real.","April 30","false","0.6"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","31","41","0","5"

Left4Dead was probably my last really passionate survival game(s) I spent way to much time playing. I am a 40 year old gamer and really don't get rattled by much. Let me just say, I was NOT prepared for how immersive this game was in VR. My very first play session lasted about a min, I got overwhelmed with Zombies and I actually said NOPE and took the headset off. I had to actually mentally prepare myself to go back into this game. I am having a BLAST, despite it being somewhat difficult for me at my current skill level. (can't seem to survive past that first real corner on the normal difficulty level, I really don't care, this game makes you want to keep playing.

I just felt I should take a minute to show this title some love. I received my Vive on Monday, 5/2/16 and spent a little time checking out the bundled software and The Lab, since it was free. From the moment I put on the headset I have been completely blown away by the VR experience. This stuff is really cool!! So after a few hours of time, spread out over a few days, checking out the free stuff I had, I decide to buy my first game. Out of the games on my wishlist I decided to go with HordeZ, on nothing more than wondering what it would be like to shoot some zombies on the Vive.\n\nI truly wasn't prepared for the experience I was about to have. LoL, To be frank, it scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me!! In a good way though, kind of like that haunted house scary during Halloween when you get frightened and then have a laugh. The first time I started, it startled me so bad I snatched the headset off and sat on my couch laughing at myself as I drank a beer and regrouped. Ok... Now I know what's up, let's do this! I strapped back in and went for round 2!!! If you'd like to see me make an ♥♥♥ out of myself, I recorded it on my phone and uploaded it. Be warned, I curse a lot. lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxrzfXpBlb4\n\nI just want to say that so far, this has been the defining VR experience for me. The immersion, presence, fear, nervousness, it was all SO REAL and I loved it. Watching videos just can't convey the feeling of being strapped in to this thing. It looked and felt so unbelievably real that I think I will no longer make comments about preparing for the zombie apocalypse because this game taught me that I'm a big scaredy cat!! lol\n\nGood job on this game guys. It looks great and plays really well. There were a few moments when the moving platform made my legs feel a little wobbly, but never really gave me any severe motion sickness. This mostly happened when the platform started or stopped.  I only mention that as an observation, not a complaint as it really wasn't a problem for me. But I know some people or more prone to the motion sickness thing!!\n\n10/10 Should probably put down puppy potty pads while playing this.","May 6","true","4.3"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","15","17","2","0"

Game slowly moves you through the area on a floating pad, but you can still move around as much as you want in the size of the room you've dedicated to room scale VR, allowing you to physically dodge and run from zombies.\n-Graphics/sound are fantastic\n-You can either use guns/grenades and use a magnet gun to "suck" in ammo boxes as they fall around you, or (my favorite) you can just equip two katana swords to ninja your way through the area.\n-$15.99 is an absolute steal. I would have paid $50 for this game.\n\nThe only possible improvement the developers could make is adding gamepad support so when the Virtuix Omni treadmill launches later this year, we can move about in the play area as far as we want to without worrying about hitting walls.\n\nA+!","May 16","true","104.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

Its easy to pick up and play. Bizarrely, after the initial scary vibe, its almost relaxing to play! **I have only played it on normal tho, Im sure things get plenty hectic on the 3 higher settings!\n\nAn addition of a shotgun and some further tweaks and this would go from good to great.","May 7","true","4.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Man, am I glad I did.  I thought the models were very detailed, the playstyle was arcade-ish but had enough realism to scare the s&*t out of me.  I only played for about 10 minutes before heading to bed tonight (HAD to write this before bed if that's any indication of the impression it left on me).\n\nI also always try to point out the good with the bad, and I'll say that it felt like switching between guns was a little clunky.  Your thumb needs to be directly over the item, rather than just in the quadrant where the item is.  My suggestion would be to make it an area selector, and not item selector.\n\nAside from that, great game and worth every penny.

Best Zombie VR Shooter yet!!! Great price!\n\nI love that it moves! Even if it is on rails. The pacing seems just about right, although at times the enemy spawn locations are not timed correctly and enemies spawn in unrealistic locations. I know it's a fantasy game so how could it be unrealistic? Well, if I have my back to the wall and an enemy spawns on top of me...I'd say that is unfair. I also played almost half the level with only 5 zombies attacking me. There are also glitches with zombies running thru the door of the first level. BTW, grenades work way better when thrown underhand. Is that a tracking issue?\n\nSo... Things done well:   Moving health level to controller is a great choice. When I first played this game I didn't even know it was on the floor. Having it on my controller is great. For added realism, could it be placed on the player's wrist, like a fake watch?\nSpeed of platform is perfect.\nSword play is a great feeling!!! Although I don't feel the zombies always react appropriately.\nIncreased size of zombies is defintely more intimidating! Especially for shorter players.\nCurrent faults:   A better way of incorporating rectangular play spaces to always be in line with the play space.\nWhen enemies get too close I see thru them instead of them stopping upon contact with me. When completely surrounded I sometimes have to shoot my self to kill them.\nGrenades don't always explode the portals. Is there a secret?\nThe gear grabber sometimes gets stuck in the on postion, or lingers on even after I've switched weapons.\nNeeds/Wants:   I'd prefer the weapon select to be a simple swipe, not a swipe and a click.\nA better way of incorporating rectangular play spaces to always be in line with the majority of the level's hallways. For this game I turn the floor chaperone on so that I'm not banging my walls.\nI'd like the sword to continue to make impact even when an enemy is dead.\nDecapitation with sword would be awesome sauce!\nCan I shoot the knee caps! It would be great to stop the explosive zombie in its place and then explode at will later with a well timed shot.\nHealth wrist watch as mentioned above.","May 2","true","2.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Let's break it down first lets get rid of the cons.\n\nCons:\n1) The game is a little buggy. You may fall through the floor on the occasion, not a frequent bug.\n2) Sometimes the game freezes up or fails to load , but I've only had that happen about three times.\n3) Weapon management could be better but honestly once you get used to it, it's not an issue. Kinda gives you that frantic moment of omg there's 10 zombies and I need my gun NOW.\n\nPros:\n1) The game is overall just fun! I've been looking for a shooter and this game really hits the spot. It reminds me of a doom style game mixed with tower defense minus the staying in one spot.\n2) Yes the weapons are not realistic in mechanics but I don't think the developer intended to be which is great because the game doesn't need it. I love the swords, the machine guns are cool and the pistols are hard to use!\n3) The game is HARD. Which is awesome! I love a challenging game and this one is difficult. It sets it up perfectly for online play.\n4) Graphics are really nice, dark and creepy remind me of left 4 dead 1 graphics. The game is really immersive and can be startling!\n5) The rail movement. Now I know a lot of people don't like this but I think it's fun. It makes you feel presence a lot and if you do not get motion sick then PICK THIS GAME UP'!\n\nSummary;\n\nWhile yes there are some minor issues the game has a lot to offer. 8 levels and a horde mod with only multiplayer, zombies , guns, and creepy settin for 11 bucks. If you are on the fence about this game like I was just dish the money out and try it.

Super fun VR and a must have for shooter fans. The trailer really doesn't do it justice.\n\nI was expecting a bland rail shooter experience, but with VR its so much fun. It's my first VR game that I look forward to playing again.\n\nMy first play made me slightly sick. The slow moving "rail" messed with my head. I thought I wouldn't be able to play it, but I got used to it quickly. My 11 year old son actually couldn't handle it and turned on the VR sickness options (recently added FYI, note for some negative reviews), which are a nice alternative. Additionally, playing through again using the teleport option makes for a different play approach.\n\nMy complaints/suggestions for improvement are\n- Audio. The monsters growls and foot steps seem to be one volume and its very, very difficult to determine which direction they come from. Big guys are sneaky quiet. Footstep sounds is horrible. So many footstep sounds overlapping it can sound like clapping.\n- Trackpad weirdness. Switching weapons feels bugged. Rarely does it switch to the item I want unless I'm looking at it. Menu at the end appears when pressing the touchpad, but doesn't actually work until you press the menu button. Continue button doesn't do anything (wrt end menu) and options of Quit and Exit are confusing.\n- Glitchy. Sometimes the shots go right through them. I emptied 3 clips into a floating skull without killing it.\n- I suck at throwing grenades. Hitting the big circle portals is harder than it seems it should be. Now I only throw underhand, it is more reliable. I've had many self kills with grenade bouncing and rolling back. (It's a literal skill based weapon, which I wouldn't complain about, but it difficult to learn and improve given the game timing and tension and the risk of it rolling back and ending your game.)\n- Swords and room space. Swords are dangerous in the room space if you swing them. I know this limitation and can adapt, but I wish I could disable them or something. Inexperienced players end up swinging erratically and the room bounds don't handle this well.\n- End game statistics take too long to animate. Just show them or let me skip it.\n\nThese are small issues though, in a game I have thoroughly enjoyed and loot forward to playing more.","May 9","true","8.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Good in multiplayer also. Buy it.\nUpdate on my review. After playing in Multiplayer witha couple people my review is to still go out and buy this game. VR Multiplayer is just awesome !!! Hard mode on this game is really hard and that is good. So much fun.\nDId I say to go buy this? Please. You will not regret.\nI can't fathom how you would not like this game. Especially in multiplayer.\nThere are some quirks and the devs are working on it but it does not take away from the fun factor. Get a friend and go to the game lobby. One starts a server and one joins. Hit start or ready and then good to go. Start killing zombies. Enjoy. For the price it is well worth it. Support VR developers if you have a VR system. Let's get this ball rolling and let the world know VIVE is here and here to stay. VR is here and here to stay.\nUpdate again: This is in response to whatever negative reviews are out there. For $15 this game is well worth it even with whatever quirks you may find. The game is not broken except in the net work connection area occasionally and that is being addressed. I mean what do people expect from games like this? It is an arcade shooter basically so every hit won't be exact and sometimes you will get swamped. Who cares? That is what makes it challenging. Are people so unintelligent these days that they can't find ways to beat the game and work around the quirks? It is one thing if coding makes the game boring and easy but another if you can still finish a level with some annoyances that make the game harder. Everyone wants free and easy these days. I am very happy with the VR community right now and how receptive they are. They all deserve good ratings for their efforts to get us games out as fast as they did. Yes a few VR games may be trash but this game is not one of them. That is my thoughts whether they are worth reading or not. If you have an issue then just send a message to the devs. They are listening but at the same time if something needs a fix then that may take some time. I am still having a blast with this game. I still say buy it if you like zombie shooters in VR. If you are still not sold then I have YouTube videos you can look at.","May 30","true","10.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There's just something extremely satisfying about a zombie shooting gallery.\n\nI get that everyone is different when it comes to motion sickness / vertigo, but I had absolutely no problem with the extremely slow movement.  It moves slow enough to not upset gameplay (ie:  you can't just race to the exit), but fast / often enough to keep the environment fresh.  Controls took me a while (3 or 4 rounds) to get used to, but I prefer the current weapon switching to any over the shoulder ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Right now I can grab ammo out of the air and switch back to a pistol without bothering to look at all.\n\nThe only real complaint I have so far is the grenades bounce too much.\n\nThe only bugs I have experienced are:\n\n1 -  level 7 in the generator room - i start getting black textures and soon can't see even zombies.  (Reproduceable - fix this please devs, I have a 980ti and am not used to having textures not drawing).\n2 - zombie which won't take damage other than a grenade (but has his eyeball fly off a dozen times as I empty a clip into his face)\n\nAs for the naysayers:\nYou CAN adjust the tilt (maybe this is new, or maybe someone didn't bother reading the options)\nYou likely can't see tracers sometimes because of muzzle flash (i've seen it every time otherwise)\nI agree the disc is lame, but hardly a show stopper\nI can hear what direction zombies are coming from just fine.  Sometimes they take a long path to get to you, but If you want to complain about audio, why not riff on the fact that the fat zombie makes no sound at all?\n\n$18 CAD is a bit high, but worth it in my opinion.\n\n","May 8","true","10.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The first few times I played it I was completely terrified.  It is very immersive and the graphics are excellent.  I can't wait till we can actually run/walk around in VR.  It's uncomfortable feeling nearly immobile in a hostile environment.\n\nThe bad: I do think the game was more worth it at the original price point.  I'm really just nitpicking here-I don't think it's way overprice or anything, just a tad high for the amount and quality of content that you get.  The game is a little buggy and unpolished in some areas; however, there are no problems with it that were game-breaking for me.","May 7","true","2.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are some pretty good jump scares, and the logic is solid. Changing weapons is still a bit panic'd but thats part of the experience i guess. I'm exited and hopeful  to have more content and possibly a refinement of the texture/model quality. Also, the tractor beam gun is quite flaky, so I spend a fair amount of time trying to pick up dropped ammo and heath. I'm hoping this is fixed soon to make it a fire and forget type of thing where I see ammo drop, i fire my tractor beam at it once, and it comes back to me.

Also, when one gets too close, it is very difficult to pull back / aim the gun to shoot it. I also have problems throwing grenades (posted in the forum).

Being a huge fan of House of the Dead, this makes me feel as though I'm inside that game. The "on the rails" movement occasionally gets me dizzy but overall, it doesn't bother me. I tried the teleport mode but I feel it takes away from the gameplay. There is some general clipping, i.e. zombies walking partially through walls. Also, when one gets too close, it is very difficult to pull back / aim the gun to shoot it. I also have problems throwing grenades (posted in the forum). Otherwise, I've spent more time with this game than any other for the Vive and it is definitely one of my favorite games.

But it's not. The following issues break the game beyond it being fun:\n-The amoured zombies are unkillable when close, so you just end up getting swamped. Where you shoot them is irrelevant. Eventually they will die, but this is after 20-40 direct shots to the face (unarmoured)\n-The waves/types of the zombies need to be controlled based on where you are in the level. So many times an explosive guy comes around a corner so close to you, that he will take half your health no matter what you do. There is no way to avoid this.\n-The headshot is very unreliable. It feels like it's in the neck, but not the head.\n-There's no dynamic effects for where you shoot the zombies. Same response head to toe (or at least that I've noticed)\n-The tiny zombies have no headshot box.\n-The sound doesn't give you much idea of direction. It sort of works, but not really.\n-Multiplayer is completely broken, or there is noone online. No idea how to fix this. Googling didn't reveal.\n-The shotgun, with a range of 1m. Errrr?\n\nThe good bits:\n+ Level design is good, textures are nice. Has a good feel to it.\n+ Pistols are great, rifles are OK but feel very sterile\n+ Holy ♥♥♥♥, getting swamped (for the right reasons) and desperately trying to fight your way out :)\n+ Immersion most of the time is high. Good jumps when you find someone behind you.\nI have given this game a No recommendation, as for £12 quid I expect certain mechanics to be working.\n\nI hope the devs take this feedback as positive, as it is not an attack on them. Their game will be great, just not recommended at the moment. Once it is suitably mature, I'll change my review - and to be honest, it's not that far off.","June 2","false","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Technically, everything as a guest in a coop game a is a little janky, but that's easy to look past if you aren't too picky. From a gameplay perspective, it's a lot less stressful having a friend watching your back in, and that's a good thing.\n\nCoop is frenetic, fun, and exciting. Me and my friend will have each of us take two directions to watch and hope we don't get overwhelmed. The game is challenging on it's easiest setting and that's not a bad thing, as it leaves you with stuff to come back to.\n\nPrice-wise, it's about perfect at it's sale price of $15.99. Unfortunately a lot of the bugs in this game feel like an early access title, but the price sort of makes up for that.\n\nHonestly, if you have a friend to coop with don't pass this game up. Here are my few issues with the game that stem from coop.\n\nCoop bugs:\n-When logging into game it assigns you an IP address. This is pulled from your gateway, which is often the same as other users. For my friend and I to play together one of us had to edit our IP address. This also doesn't save and you have to do it each time you close the game.\n-Models are almost always in the seated position in coop, but if you shoot the air above a player it will still hurt them.\n-Models don't hold their guns, they are floating in front of them\n-Animations for models basically doesn't exist, it just snaps to a few random positions.\n-The gun that allows you to suck in ammo doesn't work consistently when joining a game\n-Shots have a delay when joining a coop game.","May 16","true","4.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a fun distraction, but there are simply too many immersion-breaking elements for me to recommend.  The sound design is poor; it's hard to pinpoint incoming enemies before you see them and there's often a crackle if you fire both guns at once.\n\nThe guns are also poor.  Very unrealistic and unsatisfying, and they look like toys. The bizarre shotgun-thing particularly bad. The weapon selection device is a pain (and has to be seen to be used), and I frequently selected the wrong weapon multiple times.\n\nEnemy design is not good.  The basic zombies come in so few models that it feels like shooting up a clone army.  Monsters run up to you until they are a couple of metres away, then start a slow shuffle, which is obviously for balance purposes but looks totally artificial. The dynamic damage systems are nowhere near as good as L4D. Also, your character floats a bit off the ground, which makes all the zombies look much smaller than you, negating much of the scariness VR can bring.\n\nIt's really annoying, because there's the shell of a fun game here.  It's basic, but with polish it could be a solid experience. I thought I couldn't possibly feel short-changed with a game that cost £12, but I was wrong.

Please fix!\n\nThere appears to be a few decisions which were somewhat corrected in the latest release.\n\nFirst it appears that the game slowly moves you forward through the levels by default. An automatic teleport option has been added that apparently keeps pace with the auto forward mechanic. This is substantially better, however I constantly run into instances where the game teleports me in the middle of a legion of zombies. There's also a blinding flash when this happens which makes it very hard to figure out how you've been teleported, what direction your facing, and where all the zombies are. This should really only happen when a player chooses it to happen, or after the current zombie wave has been killed off.\n\nSecondly the default weapon selection is rather bad. When pressing the trackpad a number of bubbles appear around the controller and you need to move your controller into that bubble to pick up the weapon. It's similar to Hover Junkers of those to know, but is worse. The much better option has you selecting weapons in a pie menu on the trackpad. This is similar to Space Pirate Trainer, but not as good. I've tried to choose the center option by just tapping the trackpad, but it never works. It seems you need to rub your finger around and then release. You also can't run your finger off the edge of the trackpad (like SPT) or the menu is apparently canceled. There is no audio or force feedback when selecting a weapon either. Worst of all, the shotgun is inaccessible with this option.\n\nSpeaking of the center weapon, the tractor beam, I don't really understand why this item exists. The tractor beam solely exists to magically grab items which magically pop out of dead zombies. An item this magical seems very out of place with everything else in this game. I'm not sure why the decision was made to have this instead of of allowing you to just shoot the item like you can in games like House of The Dead or Time Crisis which this game is mimicking in VR. What is even more puzzling is that you loose points for shooting these pickup. You'd think you'd get bonus points for electing to not pick up ammo and powerups. It's not like you'd shoot this on accident. The frequency of drops is also so often that when combined with the finicky nature of weapon selection it basically means you need to have it out all the time; eliminating dual weapon usage to only once you've played the game multiple times and know exactly whats about to happen. It's a real bummer.\n\nThe combination of picking up items with the poor weapon selection really takes a lot of the fun out of this game.\n\nThat said, there's clearly only one weapon you should ever use unless you run out of ammo with it; the pistol. Not only does it do more damage than any other weapon, but you also score bonus points for racking up consecutive headshots. The assault rifle is incapable of doing this due to it's recoil, you can't select the shotgun with the better weapon selection, the katana is too short to kill anything without you being injured and the grenade can't headshot.\n\nThe grenades are however good for scoring bonus points on "portals" which you only know about if you read the convoluted starting lobby. The grenades however don't make any sound, just a flash of fire and splattering body parts if you hit anybody. Same goes for the exploding zombies.\n\nThat said the sound that the game does have is rather good. Many games have poor 3D positional audio, but this is one of the rare areas which the game excels at. There are no weapon swap sounds, there are no hit sounds, there are no damage sounds, there are no explosion sounds, weapon fire is generic, all zombies sound are generic; however the positional audio is quite nice.\n\nCatch is, a lot of people like this game; I don't know why. There's something here that could be improved into a good game, but I think that would involve destroying a lot of the game which a lot of people seem to like. Good for them I suppose. Personally I would not recommend this game. Play The Brookhaven Experiment demo instead, if that doesn't catch you fancy then wait for another zombie game, if you don't want to wait I guess you buy HordeZ.","May 27","false","1.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

You slowly move along creepy backdrops with zombies attacking you from all directions, big ones, little ones, explodey ones. Until it brings you to the level goal. Kind of like a super plodding "House of the dead" but the zombies are actually shuffling into your personal space. It handles the VR movement issue well as the "on the rails" mechanic just melts into the background when battle commences. Allowing you to go crazy capping zombies by dual weilding a decent selection of arms including melee for close quarters. I love how fun melee with dual kantanas in VR is, so you can play out your walking dead fantasies and feel like a bad ♥♥♥.\n\nThis game is untimately let down by the weapon selection controls, but this is beyond the devs control as there simply arent enough useful buttons on the Vive controller for decent hardcore gaming. That means its either the track pad (yuck) or flailing in the air for weapon selection. As you would expect this sucks and is frustratingly the reason for "game over" other than bad ammo management or lack of aiming skill, sigh -_- Valve just love their trackpads when an actual button would work so much better.\n\nStill, it's fun, lets you pop on your own music for an undead battle and gives you a katanna. Definately worth the price of admission and is the best shooter on Vive right now, but with Brookhaven's release imminent that title could be up for grabs before long.\n\nGet it while its hot...smelly and decacying.","June 5","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
