I made it to day 27 (12th place on the leaderboards for kicks) before I gave up. Once you get a powerful enough weapon, you can just stand there and hold the mouse button while using your other hand to feed your mouth with chips.\n\nI can see this game getting a lot better, but:\n\nNays (as of now):\n- I found very little use for most of the weapons, there's a lot, but you'll probably never use them.\n- Items that give you temporary stat bonuses don't last long enough/aren't very interesting, I couldn't justify picking them up.\n- Block placement is fun, but I never seemed to be able to collect enough resources to build more than 8 blocks at a time.\n- Music starts to get annoying, it's not a bad track, I just wish there was more than NUNUNUNUneeeNUNUeeeeeNUNU...\n- You can't be bothered to look at the UI early on, it's very small and should be more noticeable.\n- The cursor/crosshair is also difficult to spot, I never know where it is after blinking.\n\nYays:\n- The A.I works very well, I can see there is some AGGRO involved.\n- Bullets don't simply go straight, there's some realism.\n- Hit testing is spot on for walls/structures.\n- Various mobs, the game is not limited to zombies.\n- I don't regret paying $4 for this.\n\nBasically, this is Bird's Eye Serious Sam, but the weapons will eventually need some major balancing.\n\nWants:\n- Map Maker, especially for a tile-based game like this.\n- More items: fences, mines, det-bombs, bla bla.\n- Bosses, bosses that don't like it when I spend that past 3 hours camping in my 7x7 structure.\n- Leveling and more stats...

I would say this one is in a perfect place to be entering Early Access. The game itself is already playable and fun, but I can still see where they can add even more in the future. The co-op works flawlessly, you don't have to jump through any hoops to play with a friend. I ran into very few bugs while playing and none of them were game breaking.\n\nOver 9000 Zombies! is a Tower Defense like game, where the thing you're defending, in essence is yourself.  You can place turrets, of which there are currently 6 to choose from, you can place a block barricade, and there are roughly 20 weapons to collect.  Zombies drop health, grenades, scrap (with which to build), and on the rare occasion, new weapons.\n\nI played only co-op, but I can see it being a little difficult for someone in single player.  After one play through, we found ourselves searching for a more defensible building, as well as working out strategies to survive specific zombies on later, tougher days.\n\nI look forward to future updates. I hope to see more turret types, more maps, a map editor, perhaps more zombie types and more zombie 'bosses'.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend it!","June 25, 2014","true","6.9"," 65 of 87 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","65","87","0","1"

Even though it might look like every other indie game, just few of those games can combine gameplay and graphics like Over 9000 Zombies!. First things first, you're not gonna enjoy this game to the maximum if you're planning on playing it alone. Sure, it's fun for a while, when everything is new for you but it easily gets boring. So if you want to buy this game, buy a 2-pack and play it with your friend, otherwise you might not get the full experience.\n\n======OVERVIEW======\n\nThere's not much to say about the visual side of this game. It fits the whole theme perfectly, it's simple yet efficient, the UI is easy to use and read, simply said: I wish more indie developers would use this game as an example. It also has enough content to offer, Steam Workshop, variety of enemies, several guns (not as crazy as in Zombie Party but still interesting), etc. The game, of course, gets more and more difficult throughout the game but the difficulty level peak is not really that crazy. You can handle it if you try hard enough and already know all the basics. Plus it's, of course, easier to beat with your friend. Another thing I like about Over 9000 Zombies! is soundtrack. It's fresh, dynamic plus it supports the whole atmosphere. Don't expect a soundtrack blockbuster though. Let's move on to things I don't really like about this game. Replay value... Yeah, you probably not gonna spend hundreds of hours in-game as this game gets old pretty fast. Partial solution for this would be customization. I just feel like this game loses huge opportunity as there are not many things to custom. Actually, only thing you can custom, is map. You can create it from scratch or you can partially change it with turrets/blocks. So yeah, if you could custom or atleast choose your character, it'd be much more fun. Plus it could also revive the Workshop.\n\nPROS- gameplay/controls\n- visual side\n- soundtrack\n- Steam Workshop\n- achievements/leaderboards\n- multiplayer (although it still misses 4-player coop)\n- price\n- slightly addictive\n\nCONS- replay value\n- no customization\n- singleplayer is rather boring\n\n======RATING======\nIf this game is currently not in sale, I'd put it in wishlist and just wait for it to go on sale. Not because it's a bad game and not worth buying at a full price, but because it's on sale every now and then and you could save yourself some money. Highly recommended to buy with your friend(s).\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","February 7","true","4.6"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","0"

Valve say that you should be careful with EA and only buy games if you want to play them as they are now. Well now you can't even bank on things staying the way they are when you buy the game: they can get worse, as is the case here.\n\nSome of the videos on the store page still show the old map which is very misleading for new customers. The videos have always been misleading in other ways too: showing glitchy video effects that are not present in the game, despite in some cases appearing to be. Also at least one of the videos rotates the screen but you can't rotate the screen in the game, they are actually rotating the picture to give this misleading impression.\n\nedit: The dev has said the large map won't be coming back:\n\n"We had to make some design decisions about the size of the map, mostly because the sort of zombie survival game that this is, is the sort where you barricade yourself in a build and fight off an overwhelming swarm. Both a large and small map were tested, but because of the spawn mechanics and the way the swarm operates, I had to choose either a small one or a larger one, and the small one just played better in my opinion."","August 13, 2014","false","1.3"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","25","35","2","2"

Like hold down the grenade button and lay on that flamethrower and there are still too many zombies to see the ground. We're talking like, if these zombies were spontaneously generating from dirt, there's no way we aren't violating conservation of mass with all these zombies. We're talking more stories than grandpa has about the fourties zombies.\n\nIt's fun and simple.

Alot like Nation Red without the absurdly overwhelming difficulty to start out on.  You collect scrap that zombies drop to fortify where you wish to dig in at, you can also build turrents and find new weaponry that zombies may drop.  There are also an absurd ammount of zombies on screen at one time, there is veriations of zombies among the horde that don't feel so rehashed.  A massive assortment of weapons that you can pick up that carry from game to game to  make you stronger aginst the zombie threat plus new weapons to pick up ontop of that.\n\nIt is still quite in development, but I don't think it needs the early acess logo, it is solid enough to play on its own and cheap enough to afford, from what I see currently a great game is only going to get better, pop for it if you can afford it!\n\nAlso I would like to note that the devloper of the game, is listening to those who comment on it in the forums.

Using the same weapons unlocks new, similar ones along that tech tree and leveling up will allow you to choose an increase in one of four attributes.  There's a map editor, local co-op, and multiplayer in addition to single player.  The graphics are a bit, well, lacking and could have admittedly been a bit better for the $10 price tag.  There's also a plethora of different turrets and walls, though the map sizes are relatively small (like in Smash TV).  Along those lines, I'd probably pay $5 for this game and not $10, though everyone's mileage varies on what they're willing to spend on something in particular.

You can use the scrap metal to build turrets and barricades to try and survive the hordes of thousands of zombies. It actually seems to work quite well, though right now it does have a few good and bad points.\n\n-Surprising amount of content so far.\n-Music is nice and has good production value, gives good energy to the fights.\n-Vast numbers of enemies and explosions going on.

Considering what it aims to do, combining a top-down horde-mode shooter with slight building mechanics, it does a very decent job. However, as stated in the video, I feel that the combination of static building and dynamic horde mode does not work nicely together, as your character grows into being nothing more but another turret, static, waiting for the hordes to be taken apart by your armoured base, instead of actually being on the run, taking advantage of speed, weapons or temporary buildings.

I love the turret type style where you build while defending (fan of tower defence but i always get tired with it) so doing both is really fun.  Game is fairly easy at the beginning and gets progressively harder as the zeds get buffed but dw, you get slightly buffed too (choose different buffs according to what you want and your play style).  Something that really bugs me is the building mechanics, you click on the menu and then place it on the map where you want it to be which is fine but sometimes i try to click on a new thing and then it spawns the wrong one.  I.e. i placed a wall and then i wanna place a turret and then i waste resources placing a wall where i wanted the turret.  All in all, its a really good game, I suggest picking it up with a friend.\nPros: Towerdefence with retro shooter\nSimple and easy to pick up\nPretty addicting\nMultiplayer:D\nSteam workshop supported and you can make your own map\nPretty good replayability (with different maps)\n\nCons: personally finding material to build with was kinda difficult but thats just my opinion\nOnline may be a bit buggy atm (couldn't join some games)\nissues with building and placing turrets (tho it can be avoided if you close the building menu and reopen it)\nMechanics (the actual game) can be repetitive as there is no really difference in gameplay (kill zombies, build)\n\n8/10 reccommended:D\n\nEdit: I got this in a humble bundle and I just saw the pricetag.  Definitely not worth it.  10.99 and as much as I enjoy it, I've had it for months and i barely have 2 hours.  It's not really something you can keep coming back to by yourself.  Perhaps with a friend, it'll be better but for the price and replayability no.  Like maps will change but i played some more and it doesn't really affect gameplay... You hole up one way or another and wait for your turrets to kill, pick up material, rinse and repeat.","January 12, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Growing up playing lots of SNES games, for some reason it reminded me of SmashTV and I love that game to death. Aside from having to stay in just one area and fortifying yourself against zombie hoardes, it has that SmashTV feel to it: you kill a whole bunch of things and collect useful items. The only major difference is instead of toasters, microwaves and money you're collecting scrap metal and grenades to survive the massive amounts of zombies.\n\nOverall I really recommend this game. It has that feeling of a throwback while also capturing some elements relevent to modern games, especially the ever growing zombie survival genre. Don't be fooled by its pixel graphics either - to me that's probably one of the most enjoyable aspects of this game, and they're really well done in a way that's both enjoyable but also nostalgic.\n\nAs a side note, it's just a great damn game to run around and bust up some zombie ♥♥♥.","May 12, 2015","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was fun at first but there is absolutely no replay value. All of the maps are essentially the same, some of the more complex ones simply feeling claustrophobic. They're all fairly boring. The game is pretty broken after you play it for a bit, and the difficulty really stops increasing after a while. Once you're all set up you'll live for as long as you want. We had six turrets set up and ended up just alt tabbing and idling to see how far it would get us after a while. Quite a few bugs and glitches, it doesn't seem like they did much testing with this... It's really unbeliavable to me that this is what passes as a $10 game, you can easily find far better games than this on New Grounds or any other flash game site for free. I respect the effort put in to this by the devs, but I really feel that this isn't deserving of the price, or the praise. It might be worth it on sale, but even that is a generous statement. There's a ton more I could say about this but it would just sound like a laundry list of digs. Better luck to the studio in the future.","February 15","false","4.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

In my last run through i made it to day 9 which i found very challenging to do. On the game mechanics; I enjoy the turrets and building yourself a little base, however i didn't "feel" much difference between the range of weapons you can use. In the end i mainly ended up relying on my turrets and just throwing out my grenades, which i had over 300 of. The grenades thing i feel was a bit ridiculous as that is far more the you should be able to collect, and i was pretty much spamming them constantly. Other then that a very enjoyable game, and i hope i can make it to the 20 day mark :D\n\n(I Streamed my first playing it, however it isn't on the twitch game list so only 1 person actually saw it in the whole 2 hours :D.

'Over 9000 Zombies' basically is a tower defence game but without the actual tower defending.... if that makes any sense. The focus this time lies on keeping your character alive. You can run around the map, salvage scraps and pick up grenades. With the scraps you're able to build defences and turrets to help you in your aid. Obviously every wave you will have to defeat more and/or more difficult zombies. There are several different zombies like fire spitting zombies (or bombs?) and zombie dogs but you will also gain new weapons like shotguns, rifles etc.\n\nThe first 6/7 days are easy to survive and completing a wave takes quite a long time. During that time you will be doing the same thing (killing zombies...) over and over again that, combined with the pretty bad graphics, might be a bit boring and/or cause you an eye strain. I have not yet played this game in co-op but I'm sure it would be the most fun.\n\nOverall 'Over 9000 Zombies' is a neat little game, although I would not recommend it for the current price of 7 euro.\n\n","January 20, 2015","true","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
