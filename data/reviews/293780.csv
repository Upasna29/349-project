Playing side by side with friends and family, bulky plastic controllers in hand is a lost art and one that deserves a lot more attention. We've seen many titles try and bring back this passion for a more human gaming experience in the living room recently with successful titles like Nidhogg and TowerFall Ascension reminding us of that feeling of intense person-to-person competition and friendly rivalry we were able to get with console games in the past. With the rising popularity of online PC gaming where does this close and personal human interaction go, is there still room for the local multiplayer experience?\n\nCrawl thinks so, and it answers the call by pitting man against monster, friend against friend, in the darkest and nethermost of dungeons of the most replayable player on player brawler to date. You will die many times by the hands of your most trusted acquaintances but as Bram Stoker once wrote, "We learn from failure, not from success!”\n\nThe heavy, ominous chip melody evokes a feeling of terror and haste as the monsters swarm about the mortal player for their own chance at sweet humanity, and must tear it from the cold dead hands of their cohort before losing the chance to turn the tables. All sound direction is incredibly fitting, with voice samples sounding as if straight out of an authentic 80's pinball machine or arcade cabinet. Suspenseful horror aesthetics and the doom-impending tone of the music compliment the tension, chaos and madness of the multiplayer struggle for supremacy all too well.\n\nYou begin by choosing one of the Gods of unspeakable horrors, determining which set of ghastly familiars you will be taking control of and leveling up throughout your mad grab for humanity. Blood is gained as you spill it from your human target to be exchanged for gold and used at merchants to buy an array of varied equipment and skills, ranging anywhere from double-daggers with fast speed but short reach to floating glyphs that fire lasers on your command. This puts a lot of motivation on the monster players to bleed the human as much as possible, in order to better prepare themselves with loot once stealing back humanity.\n\nMonsters themselves add one of the deepest layers of the game, each with branching sets of evolution trees to play around with. Evolving your monsters is dependent on Vitae which is acquired through enemy humans leveling up, and keeps the playing field between the two more or less balanced. Honestly, though, I don't think anyone is capable of explaining the mechanics as well as the trailer does.\n\nBefore even getting a chance to sink my teeth into Crawls' gritty and visceral gameplay I couldn't stop watching the trailer, it sent chills down the spine. It's really the most captivating I'd seen in awhile and the narration nails the urgency of your doom-ridden quest. I had to know how such an effective voice actor was acquired.\n\nAfter questioning the developers on the subject, it turns out that the narration wasn't hired or professional help at all, but the contributions of a close friend they had previously worked with and this fact just fortified in my mind the strong bonds behind the creation of the game and it's origin of a personal and human nature. According to Dave, "The voice actor from the trailer is a friend of ours, Adrian Vaughan. He’s a 3d artist who we met at the first game studio that Barney and I worked at together. He’s one of those guy’s who’s always putting on funny accents and I got him to do some voices for an adventure game I made for a competition (called The Unicated)."\n\nApparently they weren't expecting the trailer to gain as much attention and praise as it did for the game, as Dave goes on, "We were incredibly pleased with how the trailer went, we had no idea if it would be received well or not while we were working on it. We thought it might be too long, or wordy, and it was difficult getting a balance of the tone and the explanation of the game. We’re so glad we did it that way now though."\n\nCrawl clearly has some heavy retro arcade influences, and upon discussing the game with the developers the sources of inspiration were confirmed. "For Barney, two big inspirations were Bomberman and Gauntlet, and they shine through in the gameplay most of all." and with it's blend of the dungeon delving hack'n'slash action of Gauntlet and the rage-inducing competitive aspect of Bomberman, I'm inclined to agree that both of these examples shine through. He continues to explain, "We’ve grabbed inspiration from tonnes of games though really, old RPGs like Legend of Zelda, the gothic tone of the first Diablo, and a bit of Dark Souls’ brutality to name a few." All being perfect representations of where Crawl takes its grim and savage direction.\n\nThis is a game that will bring together the most unsuspecting of players, serious-minded people who don't even game will forget themselves and get caught up in the blood-boiling clash for mortality. Not only does it bring friends together but it tests the limits of your friendship, edging you closer to feelings of vengeance on your once trusted peer. Similar to the feeling of having the excitement of 1st place in Mario Kart swiftly crushed and ripped from you by a friend lucky enough to get that one Blue Shell and take your place of glory, leaving you with nothing but the desire to track them down and kick their ♥♥♥.\n\nCrawl is a game made by friends, for friends. A multiplayer experience unlike anything seen since the 90's. A game made by two close compatriots who wanted to rediscover and reinvent what gathered them around the tube so many years ago. The kind of entertainment we've lost sight of after so many years of growing into adults, getting jobs and families, and in general forgetting what made us really have fun as kids.\n\nDespite being its best around warm-bodied experiences I can still wholeheartedly recommend the game even for those who might be too busy or too far from friends to partake in the multi-person mayhem. With bots and their adjustable difficulty, I was still kept on the edge of my seat during every attempt to steal the victory from the intelligent computer opponents. With even more balancing on the horizon as well as constant updates to content, and a serious community involvement from the developers on forums there is pure determination shown in shaping the game how players want and proves that Crawl is already one of the shining examples of Early Access done right.","August 6, 2014","true","19.3"," 239 of 274 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","239","274","0","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/recommended/293780/","spiritreviews","Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/","732 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFull disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\n\nFor the longest time now publishers and devs have decided that gamers no longer have friends in real life... our social gaming lives exist solely online. This has lead to the downfall of “couch co-op,” with many multiplayer games being released completely lacking any local multiplayer feature. It's time we say enough is enough! I still have buds over to play video games, real ones that stay too late and often drink too much (Hey Will! Sure, what kind of party would it be if you didn't vomit everywhere?).\n\nThe devs of “Crawl” remember the yesteryear of “couch co-op” and they hear our cries. Like silent, brooding Batman-y types they're the heroes local multiplayer deserves; and they're paying an homage to classic, “Gauntlet” type dungeon crawlers. The concept is simple: you and up to three friends select a god to represent (you can also use bots that are HIGHLY competent). Each god represents different creatures you'll take the form of during battle so choose wisely. Then you're dropped into the first level of the dungeon. One player is the hero, the rest of you are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ specters of death who's sole purpose is to thwart the crawler with traps and dark symbols through which you become corporeal monsters. First player to kill the crawler becomes one themselves, and the cycle continues. Be warned: “Crawl” has friendship killing potential the likes of which haven't been seen since “Mario Party,” “Mario Kart,” and the little-known “Mario ♥♥♥♥s Your Friend's Mother.”\n\nThroughout each dungeon you'll gather gold to spend on upgrades and weapons. As you clear each section you'll use vitae gathered to “evolve” your monsters, branching off into more powerful ranged, magic, and warrior types. Each level also features an ominous Stonehenge-like monument pulsating with blue magicka that unlocks the final boss once you or one of your former pals reach level 10. At that point you can choose to face the big baddie. You'll get a cool battle strategy hint in the boss fountain room before entering the arena. Each of your friends (and bots) will possess the boss, working in tandem to stop you from winning by using a variety of attacks. Assuming you win it's game over, you won! Assuming you lose another friend gets a shot. But each time you face the boss you do damage to the monument and if no one wins you will all game over.\n\n“Crawl” is beautiful, stylish, and a blast to play. The monsters are really cool, the music is most excellently retro, and when playing against three friends (or AI bots with the difficulty increased) it is a challenge. The devs (now famously) sent out a cool apology gif when they had to delay “Crawl” briefly – which to me is a good indicator that they will work with the community to continue expanding and polishing an already excellent core game.\n\nALAS, I have one major gripe. It isn't a deal breaker, not for me anyway. But at the moment there is no ONLINE multiplayer. Now I know what I said earlier. I miss the bygone days of local mutliplayer and I'm happy to see it as an option. But I still have lots of friends I want to play this with online, ones that live far away in mythical places like California and Canada. I want to live in a world where I don't have to choose. I want both, perhaps greedily. Hopefully we'll see it implemented. Otherwise keep in mind this is Early Access. At the moment there appears to be one final boss and only three deities to choose from. But what is there is highly polished and very fun. They'll be adding more end bosses and deities throughout development. I also hope to see more variety in the dungeon layouts and color schemes. But as it is this is an excellent title. For ten bucks I easily, heartily recommend this.\n\nReviewer's Note: “Mario ♥♥♥♥s Your Friend's Mother” probably doesn't exist. Probably.","July 29, 2014","true","11.4"," 128 of 163 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","128","163","3","15"

I saw this game on greenlight awhile ago (love at first sight), and I instantly wanted it. this game totally packs a new kind of competitive gameplay into dungeon crawlers. What is this game? it's multiplayer 1vs3 dungeon crawl, where 3 people can be the dungeon masters and one person will be the player; Here is the twist though: Once you kill the player you "steal" the players humanity and become the player yourself (the killed player becomes a dungeon master); which is totally new compared to the typical co-op experience you get in rogue-like games.  The goal of the game is to level up and gear up untill you can face the final boss. Whoever kills the final boss or has the most xp will win.  Another cool feature is that you can level up the enemies you can spawn as a dungeon master with a currency called vitae, which is gained by other players leveling up (Very good balancing technique, people who cant kill the player and remain at level 1 will gain more vitae than the others, so they can make their monsters super OP and finally kill the player). You can also collect small brown blobs that charge up the dungeon master's skill, and be able to summon slimes. However this game is not complete, and is still in early access; It also only supports local co-op at the moment (Not LAN co-op, its couch co-op), so For people expecting the multiplayer to be online should wait a little untill the developers can add it.  My score for this game is a definite 10/10, and it is completely worth spending $10 on.\n\nHow can this game improve?\n\n-ONLINE MULTIPLAYER: in my opinion online multiplayer is this game's key to becoming even better. Even if it is peer-to-peer/Direct IP entry multiplayer, it will still be a major step for this game's future. I know Powerhoof said that multiplayer MAY be added later, but I do not feel comfortable with "may".  From what I've seen from powerhoof's website this is their first major release, and pretty much all the other games they released were point and click adventures. It's likely they are unexperienced with networking a game, and I dont blame them (I dont know how to add multiplayer to a game). I wish for the best they can get the help they need to eventually break through this barrier and add the feature this game would be perfected with.\n-MORE SPAWNABLE MONSTERS: (maybe make several more monsters with different upgrade trees and have them randomly chosen when you choose which deity you worship).\n-MORE SKILLS FOR THE GHOSTS: The dungeon masters/ghosts skill could be different for each deity (current skill just spawns slimes after you gather enough brown orb things). Some examples: Choosing Murkan gives you the ability to summon red crystals and traps, also blocks all the doors in the room, Choosing S'hrim gives you the ability to summon zombies/skeletons that do poison damage, and Choosing Teok gives you the ability to summon slimes/or maybe dwarfs with red cone hats :P  .\n-MORE BOSSES: (could have them choosen randomly once you enter the boss portal).\nIdeas include: Hydra: it lurks in a cave inside of a pool of water. maybe a plant boss of some sort who can roots come out of the ground and stab the player, (it would be in a forest-like cave).  Another boss could simulate games where you keep running right (the boss tails right behind you as you run) untill the boss is dead (similiar to the wall of flesh in terraria).\n-CAMPAIGN MODE: let the player set the number of floors (10,20,30) before starting. after every 5 to 10 floors a portal will appear that lets you teleport to the boss which will be randomly chosen; after beating a boss in their respective lair a staircase will appear allowing you to continue,at the final floor there will be a giant red door which will lead to the final boss; the final boss will not appear in arcade mode (arcade mode is the original gameplay that you guys can play right now).  There would only be 3 tries for each boss (boss is still controlled by the ghosts (dungeon masters).  The bosses difficulty scales as you continue going down the floors (more health/damage).\n-A POINT SYSTEM: this would be shown on the screen (for campaign mode and arcade mode), to be honest I do not like that the points are completly based on gathering XP which pretty much makes everything you did as a dungeon master pointless (pun-intended).  Points Should be added once you get xp and kills.  Each XP orb gives (1) points, every time the human player hits a monster he gets (1) point, points should also be given for damaging the human player in any room; this system would be similiar to how the blood currency is distributed - Example: 1st - most damage dealt (75)points, 2nd (50)points, 3rd (25) points, 4th - least damage dealt (0)points), killing a monster gives (25)points.\nkilling a player gives(100) points, killing a player with a trap gives (150) points, and lastly\nkilling a boss gives (400) points.  This makes it so that even if you didnt kill the boss you can still win first place. The point counter would be shown at the top of the screen, but would be small enough so that it doesn't block any view of the game.\n[optional] A message could be displayed under the players point interface, announcing why they got the points.\n-DIFFERENT PORTAL MECHANICS: Don't have the portal generate on every floor, and make it so portals dont appear untill floor 5. It's kinda annoying when BOT's fail the boss, and just end up fighting him again on the next floor. Also If a player fights the boss already and loses he should have to wait a certain amount of floors before being able to fight it again (lets say 3) this way it gives the other players a chance to fight it if they are not level 10.\n-MORE TYPES OF TRAPS: (Poison darts, mine launcher, spike floor where spikes pop out of the floor when the ghost activates it, and a trap that shoots out acid that remains on the floor for a bit.\n-DIFFERENT RED CRYSTAL MECHANICS: A higher chance for red crystals to spawn in a room with traps, and a chance for red crystals to Re-appear in rooms if the player were to enter a room he has been in more than one time. (sometimes BOT's tend to run around FOREVER, and traps don't work well if the player can just run through the room which leads to this situation: The second you posses a trap the player has already left the room).\n-MORE ARTISTIC VARIETY: as you go deeper into the depths the floors theme should change. As for what you could do I have a few Ideas. A floor everything is slightly dark and is illuminated by candles (the player and enemies will have a dim glow around them so the players can see where there characters are) The pentograms will also have a red glow. Different themed floors will change the look of the enemies slightly (different colors that match the floors theme).\n-MORE DECORATIONS: Pictures, procedurally generated furniture, knight statues, sword racks, etc.\n-HERO CUSTOMIZATION: this game could have 3 different hero classes. The customization options (vanity) are unlocked after completing challenges (ie: kill 50 enemies to unlock the beholder mask).  You will also be able to choose your class and how your hero will look before choosing which deity to worship (which monsters you will have).\n\nWell This is about everything I can think of that can be added or improved, I hope you can take my review to heart and add these features in the future even if not all of them.","August 9, 2014","true","11.3"," 50 of 54 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","50","54","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jhaxavier/recommended/293780/","jhaxavier","Haxavier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jhaxavier/","312 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOne of the best local multiplayer games ever made. My friends and I have played this almost every week without fail since launch - it's that damn good. When we meet new people who claim they're into games, we vet them on this and see if they have fun or can appreciate the depth of game mechanics. We love this game because there's nothing like sitting shoulder to shoulder with a pal and howling with rage at a stolen kill, laughter at a horde of slimes causing a human to suddenly play a Shmup, or roars of hype when a close bossfight comes down to the wire. My short recommendation for this game is BUY IT. But now let's get to why you should.\n\nCRAWL is a local multiplayer game that involves between 2-4 players. One player is a human, and the other 1-3 are monsters. Every time a monster kills a human, whether it being done as a monster, as a possessable slime, or a controllable trap, that player will become the human. This has to be done on a last hit. This means that the three non-human players must work in a loose alliance until the very last minute, because there can only be one human!\n\nThe other gameplay mechanics are a bit more complicated than that, and I'll explain the most complicated one, the leveling system and the asymmetrical nature of the players:\n\n-A player possessing a human can kill monsters to gain XP and continue leveling up. This primarily adds extra health and to the human and gets the player closer to a boss run, since only characters with level 10 or higher can do boss runs. Humans get better gear and stats by accessing shops. They use gold that they gain primarly while being a monster (I'll get to that later)\n\n-Nonhuman players control ghosts most of the time. Ghosts can possess pentagrams to spawn as monsters and fight the humans. They can also control traps or collect ectoplasm while they're in Ghost mode to drop slimes, which are weak, autonomous/controllable monsters that can be dropped at any time. This is useful for trapping a human in a room, since humans must kill all monsters before leaving a room. Slimes aren't too strong on their own, but if the human's health is low, and/or the room is full of traps, they can be utterly devastating. All players can level up their monsters at the end of a round. Nonhuman players can also all control a boss monster Voltron-style, with each player controlling a limb or head and working together to kill the human.\n\nNow here's what keeps this asymmetrical gameplay balanced from a progression standpoint. As other players level up their human forms, all the other players get "Wrath", or monster XP. So as any given player human(s) get stronger, the monsters of the other players get stronger. This keeps the players' monsters roughly scaled with players' human forms, and it means that people who are especially good at playing only humans or only monsters may be in for a dramatic uphill battle once they get out of being a human/monster for an extended time.\n\nAlso, while players are monsters, they gain gold by hurting or killing the human. HOWEVER, this gold can only be used when you're a human! This means that someone who's been a monster for a long time will most likely have strong monsters, a lot of gold, but low human levels. Even if you can buy out the shop, you'll still be a pathetic creature of flesh until level up or reach the shop to get some assistance.\n\nThere's a lot more stuff going on here as well. Single-fight upgrades that require slime/gold/human health sacrifice, spells, dodge rolls, blink teleports, poisoned food, magic staffs, frog hexes, cursed weapons (that make you insane), repeating crossbows, Gabe Newell, I could just keep going on and on. Let's just say there's a LOT of content packed in the core game, and different human/monster builds play very differently from each other. There is also a ingame database to keep track of all the traps, monsters, and items, and even a monster/boss duel mode, where you can practice as a human or as a monster to improve your skills.\n\nThe only drawback I could say about this game is the fact that it doesn't have online multiplayer, and that it is quite different in terms of gameplay flow when you get started for the first time. The online multiplayer aspect is not a big deal. This game plays at a fast, almost twitch-like speed, and lag would utterly ruin the experience. As for the gameplay, a gross approximation I would make is classic Zelda crossed with Dark Souls, but the monsters are hilarious jerks because they're your friends sitting next to you! But really, it's a bit of a gross approximation - CRAWL is one of a kind. And the devs are great guys. They provide substantial updates to this game - not very often, but it's only 2 guys and they take the time to address balance issues while adding content during updates. They'll even talk to you on their Facebook page and respond to emails you send them.\n\nI'll say this though: if you ask them about online multiplayer, they'll tell you that they'll finish the game first then add it later, so don't get your hopes up.\n\nAnyway, get it, my personal GOTY every year since it launched because it's just so damn fun.","January 24","true","81.7"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","46","51","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/293780/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCrawl is a roguelike game that is being developed by the Australian team, PowerHoof. This game was put onto Steam's early access list in August 2014. The developers are very active with producing updates and content for the game, as you can see by their updated blog - http://www.powerhoof.com/\n\nWhilst I try to steer clear of Early Access games, and especially reviewing them, I decided to break my trend and try this game out as it was one I have been following for a while now.\n\nCrawl can be played single player, or with up to four people on local co-op. I have only played single player so far, so my review will be solely based on that.\n\nOne of the players will control the hero, and the others will be in control of ghosts. The ghost's aim is to kill the hero, they can do this by possessing traps in the randomly generated dungeon the hero is crawling through. Ghosts are also able to spawn into demons and monsters in various rooms.  The hero will gain experience points by killing monsters put before him, more experience means more health and more damage. The hero will also find gold, which can be used to purchase new weapons, items, potions and special abilities.  Once the ghost manages to kill a hero, they swap roles and you rinse and repeat. Monsters which kill the hero will be rewarded with Wrath points, these points can be used at the end of each level to level up the monsters to be able to do more damage and gain more powerful abilities.\n\nThe traps found throughout the dungeons can vary from bouncing spike walls, to bolt arrow turrets. All of them provide a sufficient threat for the hero, since they can't actually be destroyed, all the hero can do is escape to the next room. Unlike the monsters, where the hero has to clear the room before being able to move on.\n\nCrawl uses a nicely presented pixel style art which has a nice charm to it. Whilst it is more pixelated than most games that use this style, it actually looks a lot better than most of them. It gives it a feel as if you are playing in an arcade, with the Metal Slug style character selection screen, and the health bars at the bottom for all the players. I really enjoyed the look of Crawl, even though it's using a style which is growing very thin in the PC market at the moment.\n\nFrom what I have seen so far, there is no story behind any of the game, purely focuses on the gameplay elements.\n\nTo begin with, Crawl is a very hard game to get to grips with. There isn't an easily find-able help menu or tutorial, and you are kind of just left to figure it out on your own. Whilst this can be done after ten or fifteen minutes, it would of been nice to get a proper introduction to the game. Since I was playing on single player mode, and was up against the AI all the time, I managed to breeze through the levels with hardly any difficulty at all. When it comes to purchasing items from the shop, the AI just seemed to pick things at random, whether they are worse than what they currently had or not. Maybe this is something which can be fixed in up coming updates.  I would anticipate the multiplayer mode to be where a difficulty curve takes a large rise though.\n\nAll of the dungeons in Crawl are randomly generated, so I can't really say much about the level design, but what I can say is that all the rooms are still interesting to be in, they have a large selection of breakable objects, some of which will hold extra gold, there are normally one or two traps in each room for the ghosts to poses, and there are normally, two, if not three, summoning ports for the ghosts to take control of one of their minions or monsters.\n\nThere is a huge amount of replay-ability to be had with Crawl; I am about two hours into playing so far, and I am barely scratching the surface as to the amount of gameplay there is. Each time you finish a run, you unlock new weapons, items and abilities to use, making the next run you play completely different to the last.  I would absolutely love to see some sort of online multiplayer added to this game, limiting it to just local multiplayer seems like a silly idea to me, especially if you are putting your game on Steam. It could so easily be integrated with Steam's servers and made to be a fantastic online multiplayer experience.\n\nI had no technical issues whilst playing the game. A controller is highly recommended, as most rogue-likes go, it is increasingly difficult to play these games on a keyboard.\n\nTo conclude, since Crawl is still an early access title, I am simply going to recommend it, but verging on the side of caution. Whilst the devs are still updating the game currently, early access games always run the risk of never being completed. However, the game has a low enough in price to allow you to take that risk with the knowledge that you are easily getting your money's worth as things stand at the moment. If/when this game gets a full release, it's easily going to be a game you'll keep installed ready to launch when you have friends over.\n\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It is the best trailer for any video game I have ever seen. Don’t worry I’ll wait.\n\nNo seriously, watch it.\n\nIf you have no idea what kind of a game Crawl is, let me tell you…\n\nCrawl is a four player local co-op dungeon crawler. One player is the Human and the other three are the Monsters. Simple concept. Amazing execution.\n\nYou might be thinking, “One guy is the Human? Sucks for the other three!” Not really.\n\nI’ve had the game since Early Access release (August, 6th 2014), and in that time I’ve learned this game is fun by yourself, but it shines when you have four living breathing people to play together. It is a lot like Super Smash Bros: great by yourself, but best with friends. And it’s completely possible to have a wonderful time never even playing as the Human. The Monsters are that interesting and fun.\n\nAs the trailer showed (seriously you should watch it), when a monster kills the Human their ‘Humanity’ is transferred to the killer. Just like how gold is awarded in DOTA, rage upon last hit stealing is also included, which ensures everyone is going to be the Human at least once per playthrough. And as the Human player(s) level up, everyone else gains ‘Vitae’ which is used to level up your Monsters, ensuring there is always a challenge.\n\nIn some cases, Human players will take an early lead and level up too quickly, causing the Monsters to scale up faster than the player can cope. Meaning at level 10, Humans might have a similar experience to a player at level 1 (they can still get their teeth kicked in with relative ease). There have been many cases in which I’ve skyrocketed to level 6 or 7 and suddenly I’m fighting all 2nd tier Monsters with starting gear. This usually ends how you would expect; weeping in the fetal position.\n\nThe only way to actually gain gold is to draw blood as a monster. Mechanically speaking, that means damaging and/or killing the Human. This creates a desire to play as both the Human and the Monsters. The only way to improve your Human is, ironically, to hurt and kill other Humans. Many times I have thought “I wish I had blood” whilst doing my best to prevent the others from taking my Humanity. In my experience, you almost always feel like you’re about to die when playing as the Human. And when playing as the Monsters, you’re working with your friends one minute and then actively working against them the next. The fluid nature of the cooperation in this game is amazing. There is nothing else like it.\n\nThe main goal of the game is for the Human player to reach level 10 as quickly as possible, find the Eldritch Stones, and challenge the boss. If they win, they win! If they lose? They have to continue further into the dungeon with about 1/10th of their HP. After a total of three loses, the current Human loses the game. They’re ‘CONSUMED FOREVER,’ and the game deletes their account.\n\nDark Souls would be proud.\n\nThere is never a dull moment when playing Crawl. Whether you’re the Monsters or the Human, there is always pressure. If you wait too long, the Spirits will collect ectoplasm and summon blobs on you. There’s nothing worse than fighting tooth and nail to get through a room only to have all of your buddies summon nine blobs to finish you off.\n\nTrying to fight three other players who are working together to kill you but against each other to kill you first… is very hectic. And with so much happening on screen, it can be difficult to keep track of who and where you are. For the most part, it isn’t too hard to parse your position. It’s definitely harder to find yourself after you’ve lost track than it is to lose track in the first place. Perhaps something like an aura with your color could be added?\n\nLosing yourself aside, Crawl has an incredible lo-fi feel, while still letting you know it’s a modern game. The sprites are evocative of older games, yet they still feel fresh, new, and lively. The animation is fluid. The colors are deep and have good contrast (Thanks to the v0.3 Plague Mushroom update, released 1/15/15). Seriously, this is some of the best pixel art I’ve experienced.\n\nAlso the music is superb. That’s all I really have to say. It’s great.\n\nOverall, Crawl is an exceptional game with great gameplay, amazing art, and outstanding music. It’s simply dripping with flavor. Powerhoof managed to cram so much style into a “simple” game. It is refreshing, fun, and one of the best $10 games I’ve ever had the privilege of purchasing.\n\nBuy it and play it with all of your friends.\n\nThe dudes over at Powerhoof are going places. They have created such a great game and deserve more recognition.\n\nAnd, seriously, that trailer was amazing.\n\nLike this review?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/293780/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2360 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is only an Early Access review for C.R.A.W.L., so please keep in mind that everything is subject to change. Hopefully for the better, because I don't see how this game can get any worse.\n\nIn this 1 v 3 player game, there is only hero meant to save the world, until his jealous ghost friends stop him. The game fluidly changes from one human fighting off 3 ghosts who summon all manner of atrocities and thirst for his blood, to three "friends" partially wanting to help each other kill the human, but at the same time all those friends are just backstabbers.\n\nWith only a dodge roll and sword to start with, dodging traps, buying equipment, crawling through dungeons, leveling up and fighting monsters controlled by other players (unfortunately, unless you are smart enough to just play with bots), playing as the human means juggling three different, unpredictable enemies and traps controlled by jerks who hate you and your life.\n\nIt takes a certain amount of out-of-game problem solving to defeat/overcome the people pretending to be your friend: sometimes your opponents will say their strategy out loud to communicate to each other, but are they speaking in code? Are they trying to use reverse psychology on you (I mean the corner is totally a vulnerable spot right?)? Should you try to con them or will they see right through you? Are they whining about not playing as the human to trick you into losing? Can you just unplug their controllers or throw something at them? How good are you at throat punching? Should you practice throat punching more? Probably. All of these strategies take some serious pondering.\n\nOn the business end of the human's bloody sword, playing as the three ghost is intense and gratifying. You can summon and possess all manner of colorful monsters with different play styles and strengths. At the end of every level you gain sweet, sweet hero's blood in order to upgrade these various monsters from lowly skeletons and rats into demon lords, dragons, and beholders (among others and more to come). When not completely wrecking your friend the hero's day as fiendishly awesome monsters, you can ruin your friendship by obliterating them with traps and summoned blobs that auto-attack but can also be possessed.\n\nWhile you are happily torturing the poor human you are becoming best friends with your other two friends who aren't a lame human: you are communicating strategies through eye blink Morse code, you are yelling out fake strategies to throw the human off, you are playing dumb to catch them off guard, you are probably even fake-choking to gain the upper hand. All is great, until you realize the human isn't your only competition. And when you realize that everyone in this house sucks at the Heimlich maneuver.\n\nNow you know that those other two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are trying to take your rightful kill from you. What the hell is up with that? You were best pals just a second ago, you were like siblings, but now you deserve to be human and they aren't letting you. Now you have to try to trick the other players out of the kill by assuring them that you aren't going to unleash a fountain of fire in order to take the kill, maybe you pretend to miss all of your attacks right until that last sliver of health is begging you to take it.\n\nThen one of two scenarios happens: you get the kill and start the cycle of 1 human v 3 ghosts all over again, or someone else gets the kill and you kick them out of your house and refuse to speak to them again.\n\nI don't recommend playing Caustic Relationships And Wretch Losers (C.R.A.W.L.) unless you want to be alone. If you are already alone, the bots aren't so bad. At least they aren't a bunch of backstabbers. You can always count on red to be your friend....\n\nSeriously though, Crawl, at a most basic level, is incredibly interesting. Part co-op, part competitive, and all fun. It covers a wide audience range by being finely tuned for accessibility while still remaining flexible and deep enough for more serious players to give each other a good challenge. I eagerly look forward to all of the tuning and content updates will bring.\n","January 25, 2015","true","104.9"," 43 of 50 people (86%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","86","43","50","28","0"

Awesome.\nThis dungeon crawling masterpiece is incredibly fun to play. I love playing it so much. Here's why:\n-Radomized Dungeons: Each time you play the game, you get something different. Even the textures on the wall are different each run.\n-Wide Variety of Weapons: There are lots of different weapons to choose from, and not all of them are the same. There are heavy melee, light melee, ranged weapons, and magic weapons as well as various spells/abilities that can be aquired during a run.\n-Play as the Monsters: This game is meant for 2-4 players (I suggest 4 even if 3 are bots), 1 player is the hero while the other 3 are ghosts who can become monsters to try to kill the hero and take his place. It adds a unique feel to this game.\n-Multiplayer Mayhem: This game really is meant to be played by 4 people (even if can be played by 1), with 4 people this game becomes an all out brawl to become the hero and beat the boss to clear the game. It is an unforgettable experience to gather some friends and just play this game.\nCrawl is an amazing game and the devs should be really proud of themselves. I can tell that they put a lot of hard work and energy into making this game the best it can be.

You have a primary attack, and a special attack which can be changed. When you get enough XP, you get to Level 10. When you reach level 10, you fight the only boss so far, Kourok. If you defeat him, you win. If you lose, then you have 2 more tries. 3rd try and you fail, and you lose.\n\nThere's a catch though. One player is a hero, while the other three are ghosts who control the traps and spawn the monsters of the randomly spawned dungeon. Your monsters are determined by the god you choose. The god also influences your bonus stat. (Ex: Each monster has +1 HP) When a ghost's monster or trap kills the hero, they "take their humanity" and become the hero, while the killed hero, becomes the ghost that is empty. When you reach Kourok, all three ghosts control each part of the boss. (Ex: Bubbles, Laser Eye, Acid) The three tries are for your whole group, so if you are the 3rd person and you lose against Kourok, you are disqualified. When you attack the hero with a monster/trap, you gain the hero's blood. When you are the hero, you can trade the blood at a buddah like shrine for gold. The gold can be used to buy weapons, special moves, and other things like artifacts and potions.\n\nThis game is one that I will be playing until my fingers fall off. The movement is smooth and the attacking is snappy. The competitive nature of this game is so great, that I throw my gaming pereferal at the ground screaming while my friend(s) laugh. This game can be played with bots, and it is fun with bots too, but playing with your friends is a whole new level to the masterpiece which is 'Crawl.' I will further help and give tips/feedback to this game and I hope POWERhoof the best.","February 22, 2015","true","7.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","20","23","3","0"

Ever.\n\nBut this game deserves it. So let's get started.\n\nFirst of all, what is Crawl?\nLike the name suggests, along with the pictures, you might understand that it's your usual dungeon crawler. But it isn't.\nIt IS a dungeon crawler. But not in the likes of Diablo or Torchlight. It's more of a skilled-hack 'n' slash-dungeon crawler.\nAnd TBH, as a fan of dungeon crawlers, this is the best one I've ever seen.\n\nI might also add that I may have a little bias about it because of the god damned amazing music/teaser trailer. But I digress.\n\nAs I've said before, it's not your usual dungeon crawler. And there's also another reason because of that. It's not open world and it's not story driven. It's an arcade game.\n\nAnd it does it really well. The game, as you may already know if you're reading this review because you want to be sure that the game is nice, is a local co-op/versus game.\n\n"But Baron! I don't have any friends! I'm a god damned loner!"\n\nWell they added some bots which you can play against for "practice while you're waiting for your friends". And they're also going to add multiplayer in the near future. So that's good. Because I'm also a loner.\n\nHow's the gameplay?\nIt's good, 10/potato.\n\nJust kidding. The gameplay is absolutely amazing, but to be played at its best you NEED a controller. Which isn't a problem FOR ME, but might me a problem for the people who can't afford to buy one. Any controller that is supported by steam will do. But personally I prefer to use a PS3 controller with the scarlet crush drivers.\n\nAs I've said at the start of this review, the game is part hack 'n' slash. And it's a blast. The controls are responsive and easy to learn. It's literally just two buttons. I've never found myself saying "God damn it, I didn't want to do that!", if I died it was 90% of the times because of the skill of the bots or because I wasn't good enough.\n\nThe only problem about it might be that they made the button to attack also the button to "use" stuff. I've found myself sometimes entering the final boss battle by mistake with little health remaining and dying by the hands of the bots controlling the boss.\n\nHow are the graphics?\nWell, I really don't know, I don't have eyes to see a god damned PICTURE ON THE STORE PAGE.\n\nTL;DR?\nDo you like co-op fast paced hack 'n' slash dungeon crawlers games? Then this is for you, I guess, I've never heard of games like this, but whatever, everyone has their own fetish.\n\nGib scor plz\nKK bb, from a scale from 1 to 10:\n\nMusic: 10\n\nGameplay: 10 [seeing yourself getting ♥♥♥♥♥ to death just to kill the same bot that killed you is an amazing feeling]\n\nGraphics: 10\n\nOverall: 10\n\nOn a side note, it runs on my toaster, 10/10","August 6, 2014","true","19.0"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","3"

One person starts out as the hero and the other three players (or AI) are ghosts that can inhabit deadly traps to attack the hero, or stand on a pentagram and become a monster with special abilities.\n\nThe goal of the hero is to level up and beat the dungeon boss, while the goal of the ghosts are to collect ectoplasm to level up, kill the hero, take over his body and kill the boss. Along the way, you stumble upon shops where you can buy trinkets that give you buffs, or new weapons. Going deeper into the dungeon allows all players to level up their summonable monsters which evens the playing field between hero and ghost.\n\nThe first time I got to play this game with three other friends was when I realized that this game was truly worth the purchase and the risk of buying an early access game. I tend to stay away from EA games unless I see that they have true potential of becoming a complete game, and this one definitely has it. If you're on the fence about getting this game, take my advice and BUY IT!

If you're looking for non-stop fun killing your friends and taking your throne as the ultimate friend, well this game is for you. Definitely worth the money you paid for this game.\n\nYou can play with someone using only mouse and keyboard. Other than that is through the use of controllers.\nWhile you wait for your challengers, you can train against the bots and they are deemed quite powerful in the normal difficulty, how much more in the hard difficulty which is no mercy.\n\nThere are also deity challenges that really measures your capability against others. One of it is the Glub where you only stick to one monster type and weapon in which you cannot evolve nor change weapons. Are you up for the challenge?\n\nI am keen and supportive to the development of the game because I am a huge fan of this game and to the team behind it.

Once a game starts, one player is chosen to be the human hero. The other players start as ghosts, that can only affect the player through possessing traps around the dungeon, or spawning as a monster on a pentagram. All monsters have unique abilities.\n\nIf a monster kills the hero, they will become the hero themselves, and transform the previous hero into a monster. If the hero kills a monster, then they will gain xp, as well as give "wrath" to the enemy ghosts. The ghosts can then use this to upgrade their monsters into evolutions with different abilities. This keeps the game balanced very well.\nA hero can use collected gold to purchase new weapons, spells and accessories at shops. The hero also uses xp to level up to level 10. Once that has been reached, a portal will open on the floor, and allow the hero access to the boss.\n\nBoss fights are interesting, because the enemy ghosts can take control of different parts of the boss. Shooting acidic balls out of one hydra head, or bubbles out of a tentacle.\n\nThere's a lot to the game that makes it very interesting, and can be quite strategic if you really plan things well.\nIt's a lot of fun when played with friends, although the AI is also quite competent.\n\nOverall, a great game!","September 21, 2015","true","3.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","16","19","2","1"

The amount of time that was put into devising upgrade trees for monsters and old gods to worship is visible.

I do have a few complaints about the overall balancing however.\n\n1. Defensive playstyles through monsters are ultimately more rewarding than aggresive playstyles, and camping is a big problem. (Atleast, in the 12 hours we've played collectively).\n\n2. Because of this, some of the final monster evolutions are not worth evolving too (Im thinking of the slug, for example)\n\n3. Part of the issue is because of all these defensive options you're given as monsters, it almost feels like online would just be overwhelmingly frustrating to deal with if it was implimented. If i wasn't sitting next to some friends playing this game, i'd probably have ragequit against the defensive playstyles in an online setting playing against people who i didn't know. (This is just personal prefernce however, and im sure online would still be an amazing adition for the community and players of this game)\n\nIf the dev's were able to find a way to combat this while not completely destroying the ranged characters playstyle, it'd be much more rewarding to play as a monster, and maybe not feel like such a scumbag to your friends all the time.\n\nNegatives aside, this is still a blast to play, and leads to many hilarious moments. May lead to some frustrations, but ultimately is one of the most entertaining Couch co-op games i've played.","April 17","true","14.7"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","17","22","2","0"

Upon slaying these monsters, you gain experience points, which you can use to fight the boss after you have collected enough.\n\nIf your friend (a monster) kills you, you swap places, meaning you spawn the monsters, and they fight them. When you kill the adventurer, you gain "hero blood" which you can trade for gold to spend at a shop, spending it on weapons, allies, and abilities.\n\nWhen you eventually fight the boss, the game doesn't stop being multiplayer. Oh, no. The non-adventurers must actually possess parts of the massive boss and work together to defeat the adventurer. If the adventurer kills the boss, he/she wins. If the boss "kills" (you teleport back aways) the adventurer 3 times, the game is over.\n\nWhen a game is over, you can unlock new monsters which players can transform their previous monsters into. You also unlock new abilities for monsters and adventurers, etcetera.\n\nOverall, I think that Crawl is a masterpiece. The pixel-art blends very well with the shifts in scene, the soudtrack is amazing, and the gameplay itself is one-of-a-kind.\n\nI rate this game 10/10, and it's still in development.

The game features an unique A-symmetrical competitive design where it's a hero against a team of ghouls. Though the ghouls can not directly harm the hero, they can spawn mobs, turn into greater mobs, and take control of traps to hinder the hero's progress. Though the ghouls have the common goal of killing the player, they are still in competition with each other to land the killing blow. To break it down, it's an XP race, and you can't gain XP unless you are the hero, and you can only become the hero if your ghoul lands the killing blow. This dynamic presents some very interesting and unforeseen strategies.\n\nThe game's art, music, and sound design are all top-notch, and worthy of praise. The pixel art is detailed and well animated, while the music and sound design is distinctly 16 bit. Overall the game keeps to it's theme quite well, and it's certainly not too hard on the eyes.\n\nThough the game features some very unique and interesting ideas, and top shelf presentation, it's not with out it's flaws. Currently, as of this impression, the game only features local multiplayer. For a game that is very multiplayer focused, this is a huge sin. Those who have people close at hand, Crawl is an easy recommendation, but if don't, then you have to consider your purchase more. I've played this solo and still enjoyed it greatly, but after a while, bots are bots, and once the gimmick of the unique mechanics is settled away, boredom can eventually set in. I can see how this is much more interesting with live people, unfortunately I never got to experience this very important aspect of the game due to it's lack of online.\n\nOverall all Crawl is a very uniquely designed competitive game that is both engaging and beautiful. Even at it's current early state the game feels stable and "finished". Any new updates from this point will feel more like extra content, than the game making up for obviously missing parts. This is a good thing :) It's just too bad about the lack of online. With out it It's not as easy of a recommendation as it deserves to be, but hopefully in the (near) future, that will be rectified.\n\nPros:\n- Uniquely designed competition / mechanics\n- Great presentation\n- Easy to understand, but challenging\n\nCons:\n- No online... :(","August 7, 2014","true","4.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","5"

This game is especially good for when you want to sit down and have a quick instant fix of fast action, because matches mostly range between 20-45 minutes, and can even last longer depending on how much you want to level up before facing the boss.\n\nThe atmosphere is on point in terms of making you feel as if you're exploring a dank dark dungeon that's haunted by an ancient evil presence, the spirits that haunt you, follow you and possess traps and summon monsters only add to this feeling... there are some references to Lovecraft's work in the level names which is always a nice touch, the rooms and map layouts are randomly generated and every playthrough is different, but unlike many other games with randomly generated rooms you don't start noticing the same variation of a room being repeated until maybe 5 or so hours, there isn't an arbituary set pattern in which you experience rooms either, the only thing that's consistent is that each floor has one store (with each floor having randomly selected different items, making way for different character builds which further ensures each playthrough is unique), one portal that leads to the final boss and one exit that leads to the floor below.... anyway regardless, even if the room layouts aren't always unique... the map layouts are always unique, the repetition of rooms isn't something you're bothered by because you're too busy trying to get the final shot on the hero or you're the hero desperately trying to cling to every last inch of your humanity and you really become absorbed in the addictive gameplay... it's also worth mentioning that the developers are awesome dudes who are very responsive to the community, always respond positively to ideas, negative criticism, and are still constantly showcasing screenshots of different environments / room layouts that are in progress so you can expect to see much more variation in that department in the future, at the rate I see them posting screenshots of new room types, my point on rooms repeating themselves once or twice per match will probably be completely and utterly void by the time this game gets a release... it's also really fun to play single player even if it's designed for co op!\n\nRecommended!\n\nPS: I love the skeletons to death, whenever they laugh or use their ranged attacks where they throw a bone at you, I get a flashback of Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness where the skeleton says to Ash; "I've got a bone to pick with you!" :P","April 3, 2015","true","67.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

And I know some people will say that was a terrible game, but it has a warm spot in my heart. There is something very primeval about getting to be a monster, especially when massacring your friends.

The replay-ability of this game is actually amazing! I used to play this game with my brother a year ago and now I have most of the people on my college dorm floor actually addicted to palying it. This, combined with the fact that the game isn't actually finished is stunning. The balance between human and monster gameplay is amazing. Many people will talk bad about how some monsters you can just troll with, and to that I say, "Git gud."\n\nThe only problems I have observed with this game are the variety of final bosses. There are currently two. Most of the time a certain player has the skills to destroy a certain boss, no matter how good the boss controlers are. Therefore, sometimes its up to the flip of a coin as to if someone will win the game automatically or not. HOWEVER, I am happy to hear that they have annaounced and are in the progess of making a thrid boss. This will fix the lack of variety.\n\nAnother note is that the longer you play the more you find really cool room themes. Some I have seen semi-frequently are rooms with the walls/floors lined with blood sigils or rooms that have grass and vegetation. I would love to see even more of these fun-to-find environments as the game is developed.\n\nOverall, this early access game could be a game all on its own right now if it wanted to. However, I am very glad work is still being done on it. I encourage literally everyone to buy and play this game.

You're four lost souls damned to wander an unholy dungeon, fighting to escape through exerting your will upon the frail flesh which happens to pass before you. As a spirit, you are ever at odds for when you inhabit the hero the other spirits seek to displace you, and when you are a spirit, you must be the one to strike the killing blow if you would escape. Once you've advanced your hero to a sufficient level, and subsequently discovered a portal, you can go through it to face a monstrosity which may end up inhabited by all your foes. Fail there, and return to the dungeon, until someone escapes, or you collectively fail too often.\n\nIf Crawl has a flaw, and you do not agree that the flaws are at times inherent to the beauty of a piece, it is that the game loop is secured around four players. If you do not have four people, you will need to fill the remaining slots with A.I. which - while quite capable - is not nearly as unpredictable and thus exciting as a human player.\n\nPurchase a copy, invite three of your friends, and prepare to writhe - no - crawl your way back to the living.","January 9","true","3.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

The interesting mix of so many elements is immensely entertaining.  Crawl is a retro themed, but modern take of a dungeon crawling mix of assymetrical multiplayer with co-op and campaign elements among many other great elements.  This game is the perfect combination of game elements that just becomes... well, perfection.  I started gaming years ago and have played games of practicaly any kind, but this game is somewhere in my top 3 favorite games of all time!  It is perfection!\n\nNow, time to address negative reviews.  All negative reviews of this game either complain about the lack of online multiplayer or lack of content in the Early Access version at the time they typed up the review.  Since the writing of those reviews at the early Early Access of the game, the game has gained a ton of more flesh to it.  It is full of content and exciting gameplay and there are still updates to come because this amazing game is still in Early Access.  Online play has not yet been implemented so it can be hard to find the full 4 player game it was meant for, however, at the time of me typing this review I have a 19 hours of gameplay.  At least 12 of which have been me with no other players and just a full roster of bots and I still found this game amazingly entertaining.\n\nOverall, this game is one of the best games of all time and deserves to be on a top 10 list of games of all time.","May 8, 2015","true","35.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

You can play it against bots and they work great but multiplayer is really where it's at. It feels like arcade games used to back in the golden age of arcade games.\n\nIt makes a great party game, but take note that the multiplayer is local only (at least for now) and you will need joypads, ideally.\nOne player can use the keyboard but you can't aim precisely using it. You can use this to handicap a player if they're winning too often though, or turn off precise aiming for everyone if you like. You can even use a mouse as a controller if you're desperate.\n\nPowerhoof have also added a 'taunt your god' option, to properly handicap individual players in a variety of ways, fixing the one gripe I did have about the game.\n\nOne player at a time has human form and all the other players are ghosts that gang up and try to kill them with monsters and traps. Get the killing blow on the human player and you take human form instead! The human player advances through the dungeon to attempt to kill the boss and win.\n\nThe animations are superb, the music is great, the controls are tight and responsive and the combat is smooth and impactful. Even in Early Access the game has a lot of variety, there are a ton of weapons, items, potions, abilities and monsters.\n\nAlso the trailers are great, and the main trailer gives a nice overview of the game if you're about to start up a game with new players.","March 25, 2015","true","9.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I wore them for leisure and abuse their usage and flung them at this game. Again and again, the bots cut me down! And I was tickled to see a trace of smugness in their eyes.\n\nDid they think I would just play with bots down here?\n\nPlay with 3 Human Players!\n\nThe others flanked with analogs, mice, and keyboards, and bled bots of their purpose. They were soon to die, these puppets of artificiality. But when will Powerhoof deliver the killing blow? If they could slay them now, the game would be reborn . . . filled with humans.\n\nKill your friends and smile about it.\n\nAnd as time went on, they fell! Purpose poured from their corpses and filled CRAWL to the brim and flashed praise and anticipation of multiplayer and flared my excitement, reborn.\n\nGo to the forums; post your opinions and suggestions\n\nPowerhoof was pleased with the suggestions we have given and rewarded us with content and updates. Taking these, I lobbied with a friend, for fun, excitement . . . and the urge to kill.\n\nOnly one gets out alive after all\n\nWith new vicious tools, I butchered friend after friend, growing ever delightful, but my friends grew also, and I could seldom hold my Humanity for long. Avatars were shredded underfoot as we fought for our prize: that one fading spark of opportunity.\n\nWe seized it!\n\nWe lost it!\n\nWe took it and we fled!\n\nFor Humanity alone held the difference. And stealing that prize, I hurled viscous blades and teeth and flame—\n\nTo a room most strange and very boss-like.\n\nThe eldritch stones split a ragged hole in the air, a gateway to the Final Boss above.\n\nAnd winning . . . if you dare take 1 of 3 chances behind.\n\nahem, ahem\n\nOkay, now that that’s over with. The results are here:\n\nGraphics: Retro, not a bad thing really. It worked well here.\n\nSound: Retro and somewhat repetitive. Like the olden games betwixt the 80s and 90s.\n\nGameplay: Chaotic, but fun. Really fun. Future updates will have to require an indicator to keep track of your player’s location on the screen, though; colors alone are insufficient for something this fast-paced.\n\nReplay Value: Oh eff the hell YESSSSSSS!\n\nVerdict: A great buy for playing with friends and ganging up on each other. Also hope to play with strangers in multiplayer.","August 16, 2014","true","1.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

I'll try to avoid giving out the same details as everyone else, but the praise is well-deserved, this game does a ton of things right! Now, since all the peeps below me have given the game the good stuff, I'll say all the bad stuff I have come across.\nFirstly, the rooms look nice, they really do, but they all look the same, their shapes are different, and that does determine life or death in circumstances, but still, change it up a bit please. Secondly, the game could use some balancing, the starting human starts off at  major disadvantage to the monsters when they inevitably fall and become a monster, they're a super-weak monster (this is an early access, so this'll be fixed sooner or later.). The controls are also less fit for a keyboard as you can only aim in 4 directions, this can be fixed with a controller, but not all of us have those, and it often makes the game a tad more difficult when aiming. The boss also has an unskippable cutscene which after a while made the boss look kind of...Cute, in a derpy fashion...(IGNORE THAT.).\nBesides the above, this game is a great example of early-access done right, and its dev's are fun guys. I highly suggest you get it if you have friends locally near you, if not, it may not be the best, but you can play with bots, who are pretty smart, and can become stupid if you turn down the difficulty.","August 7, 2014","true","17.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Its pretty much like its not in early access. What I like about the game is that there are a lot of possibilities in the battle of who is to win. I like how there are only three chances you get to win the game. With that being said, anyone over the level of 10 could go for it when they reach the shrine. As of right now there are two bosses you can either be or fight which is randomly chosen for you when you activate the shrines. Either you or the other 3 players (depending on who activates the shrine) become part of the three parts of the boss, and you have to try to defeat the boss while the others use the boss to defeat you. Anyone can fail twice fighting the boss battles. The third time whoever fails will ultimately lose the game and the other players win in a first, second, third basis.(The loser being 4th) I also like the dynamic of there is one hero and the others are ghosts vying for the life of the hero and use forms of monsters to try to steal the life of the hero and become him. All an all this is a great game and I cannot wait for the full version. What I would like to see in the full version is a database for all that you unlock like a lore, just like Risk Of Rain. And also I really hope and pray they create multiplayer because that would make it 5 stars in my opinion.","August 7, 2015","true","6.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Even though it is in early access, it has very little bugs. ( so little I haven't spotted one)\n\nThe main goal is to level up to ten and defeat the boss at the end.

( for both ghosts and humans) The game is also very balanced. You also unlock more items for your next round. I haven't unlocked everything yet, but everytime I do unlock something (you unlock at least one thing every game) I want to see it and test it out. This game has a ton of items to choose from. Making it very easy to fit your play style. One more thing I love is the "gods" you can pick from. The gods is like your class for your hero. They give you three monsters and a passive to help your ghost or hero. In the end of every level you can level up your monsters.\n\nIn the end, I am so pumped to see every update, to unlock every new thing, to destroy my friends in a battle with all odds against you.

I invited some friends over, and we had a blast screwing each other over, and continue to to this day. The game has come so far, starting with just 3 evolutionary trees and a handful of monsters, to 10+ trees, 40 monsters, and a gigantic variety of monster-slaying weaponry to fend off your impending doom. If you're looking for a fun party game with an arcadey, rpg feel, this is the game for you. If I had the opportuntiy to buy this game again, I would gladly do so,\n\nI do have a few minor complaints -- you almost need controllers to have the best experience. Playing with the keyboard or mouse is sufficient, but controllers provide a more fuild playstyle. Other than that, the only other problem I have is that some evolutionary trees seem to be better than others, but that really depends on your proficiency with certain monsters.\n\nAs of when this review was written, there are only two bosses, but the ghosts work together inside of one boss to thwart the player. There is a hydra, with three heads -- fire, ice, and poison -- and a kranken that fires an enormous laser whilist trapping the hero in bubbles and spewing pink acid. Nothing is more satisfying than killing the boss on your ast try, with 1 health remaining... or, killing the hero at the very last second.\n\nHaving all 4 players isn't a necesity, but does provide a unique experience. Colluding with your friends to utterly destroy the human is such a fun feeling. If you don' have 4 friends immediately around, playing vs another friend is a challenge that tests your ability to fully utilize your monsters and/or hero abilities and skills. On the off-chance you have exactly 0 people to play with, you can always fight with the AI on varrying difficulty levels.\n\n10/10, would kill friends over and over again.","September 19, 2015","true","45.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

After several hours of playing I have not once experienced a single crash or significant bug. The fighting is also incredibly balanced and the player and monsters never feel ridiculously powerful or impossible to kill. you never die from a cheap shot and every bit of damage you take feels like you could have avoided it. it has a very Dark-Souls-Esk feel to the combat, its fast, fluid, responsive and satisfying and you never feel punished for dying.\n\nAdditionally, if you have no buddies to play with the, AI is superb, acting much like a human does in how it moves, fights and decides to buy items (pausing for a brief moment to think). having the choice to alter the amount of players (from 2 to 4) is great and acts as  a subtle way of modifing the difficulty in addition to the AI also has a difficulty modifyer.\n\ncontrollers also have complete compatability, very literally plug and play. either it be a 360 or ps3. (I cannot confirm for other controllers, but it seems to be the case)\n\nbut when you have 4 controllers, the computer hooked up to the big screen and a few beers around, this game absolutely shines. even in alpha this game is honestly brilliant.\n\n\nBUGS\nThese are the only bugs that I have noticed thus far (and they are pretty minor ones at that).\n\n1. as a ghost you can fly around the map collecting ectoplasm. when you collect enough you can spawn upwards of 3 slimes to enter the field at any time. they are weak, but can certainly be an effective distraction, causing surprising damage if not delt with.\n\nThere appears to be a spawning bug, you can place them anywhere on the field  however placing them too close to a wall or corner will result in them getting stuck and unable to move. This is no problem as they are easily cleaned up and the game can continoue, but this will probably be quite easily fixed in later versions.\n\n\n2. The AI. while acting pretty reasonable most of the time and are certainly a worthy challenge (I am yet to win a watch against simply 2 AI on normal, I cant imagine what 3 on hard would be like).\n\nthey do, ever so rarely get a little confused if there is alot of gunk on the floor. As they try to avoid it they end up running over it multiple times and take significant amount of damage figuring out how to behave (but they do snap out of it eventually) . yet, so far, this has only happened maybe 2-3 times in the many matches I have played and only seem to last for that room. its a rare occurance and will probably be patched at a later date.\n\n\nbut apart from that.....nothing of mention, the game is very well polished. very easily worth the asking price.","November 21, 2014","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SwearToDog/recommended/293780/","SwearToDog","Dog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SwearToDog/","68 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've really liked this game. So far I've been playing it for about an hour and here are some of my first impressions:\n\nGameplay: The gameplay itself is very sleek and smooth. Crawl resembles that of a button mashing arcade figher, which isn't a bad thing. There are two buttons you use to attack (primary and special) which just feels very satisfying. The concept itself is original as well, and that's something I haven't seen in quite a while. It's almost like a multiplayer dungeon crawler King of the Hill RPG.\n\nYou battle your friends who are attemtping to kill you in order to revive themselves as humans and collect randomized dungeon loot along the way. If you or any of your friends finish off the human, they revive and then have their shot at completing the level. As the ghost characters, you take control of items and can summon monsters which you can evolve. At a certain point along the way you gain enough experience to fight the boss battle. Admittedly, the boss battle did come a little quickly and I had beaten the game before I knew it. However I noticed I unlocked a few items, so I know that coupled with the randomly generated levels means replayability is implied.\n\nArt Style: I'm also a fan of this art style which is what first caught my eye. The animations are smooth and the characters are well drawn. I've never been the type to complain about pixel art as if it were an excuse to "real art"; it looks great. The only issue is I find myself backing away from the monitor to get the full view of some text which is otherwise a little difficult to read from up close.\n\nMusic: About what you would expect, pretty catchy but has a few points where it appears to stutter.\n\nThis game is in early stages, and it looks promising. So if it's good now, it can only get better.\nIt's only $10 right now so there's really nothing to lose by giving this a try.\n\nI suppose the only thing I'd like to see a network multiplayer. And I understand the naivity of most people who make that statement and don't understand that networking isn't an easy task, but I could see this game being a blast at LAN parties and with friends who don't want to crowd around one screen or use mutliple controllers.","August 12, 2014","true","1.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Runs absolutely perfectly, with brilliant gamepad support using steamos-dkms xpad drivers.\n\nI have a soft spot for local multiplayer, and so I tend to add to basket as soon as I see a game tagged in this way. This review starts by saying that Crawl is potentially one of the best local multiplayer games I've played for a while.\n\nI played this game last night with my sister and parents (3 gamepads and myself, the unfortunate soul with the keyboard). I know we'll play again tonight, its that kind of game. Each time you play it begins like this, someone starts up the game, everyone taps their respective controller and occupies a slot, which the game cutely refers to as inserting a coin. You enter a 3 letter name, or choose a previously used one. Then you select a deity to worship (as of writing this review there are 3 deities; two instantly available and 1 unlockable). Your choice of deity decides what sort of beasts you can manifest yourself as to hinder the current hero. The game begins.\n\nThe current hero is selected randomly from the up-to-4 players, and attempts to crawl through the dungeon as far as possible, amassing gold, buying new items and buffs. All the while, the non-hero players attempt to kill the hero by either manifesting as monsters by activating pentagrams that are one the floor of some rooms, "going-poltergeist" and possessing traps or turrets, or summoning slimes that they can stockpile by collecting dust. The non-hero player that kills the hero player gets to continue where the previous hero player left off, albeit without his buffs and items, these have to be collected individually. The object of the game, which you can only progress towards during your time as the hero, is to reach at least level ten so that you can open the boss portal, and defeat the boss. Aside from this the game has intervals everytime a player descends to a lower floor. During these intervals players receive vitae points for everytime an opposing player levelled up on the previous floor. They can use these points to evolve their selection of beasts, making them stronger and a greater threat to opposing heroes.\n\nWhy I like it so muchThe game offers a simple but very replayable mechanic. The non-hero players work together to try and kill the current hero, but ultimately want to beat the others to land the final blow and secure precious flesh-and-blood hero time. The current hero works to improve their items, spells and buffs so that they can fight off opposing players for longer. The struggle is fast paced, skillful and very fun. After level 10 players have the chance to nab the winner's position by choosing to fight the boss, but they only get so many chances, otherwise they finish last. As more bosses are implemented into the game, the risk of entering the boss portal will become even more interesting; what if its a boss you don't like and you only have one chance left? Maybe you should level further? But what if one of your opponents goes through?\n\nSo so fun.\n","August 15, 2014","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After several hours of playing I have not once experienced a single crash or significant bug. The fighting is also incredibly balanced and the player and monsters never feel ridiculously powerful or impossible to kill. you never die from a cheap shot and every bit of damage you take feels like you could have avoided it. it has a very Dark-Souls-Esk feel to the combat, its fast, fluid, responsive and satisfying and you never feel punished for dying.\n\nAdditionally, if you have no buddies to play with the, AI is superb, acting much like a human does in how it moves, fights and decides to buy items (pausing for a brief moment to think). having the choice to alter the amount of players (from 2 to 4) is great and acts as  a subtle way of modifing the difficulty in addition to the AI also has a difficulty modifyer.\n\ncontrollers also have complete compatability, very literally plug and play. either it be a 360 or ps3. (I cannot confirm for other controllers, but it seems to be the case)\n\nbut when you have 4 controllers, the computer hooked up to the big screen and a few beers around, this game absolutely shines. even in alpha this game is honestly brilliant.\n\n\nBUGS\nThese are the only bugs that I have noticed thus far (and they are pretty minor ones at that).\n\n1. as a ghost you can fly around the map collecting ectoplasm. when you collect enough you can spawn upwards of 3 slimes to enter the field at any time. they are weak, but can certainly be an effective distraction, causing surprising damage if not delt with.\n\nThere appears to be a spawning bug, you can place them anywhere on the field  however placing them too close to a wall or corner will result in them getting stuck and unable to move. This is no problem as they are easily cleaned up and the game can continoue, but this will probably be quite easily fixed in later versions.\n\n\n2. The AI. while acting pretty reasonable most of the time and are certainly a worthy challenge (I am yet to win a watch against simply 2 AI on normal, I cant imagine what 3 on hard would be like).\n\nthey do, ever so rarely get a little confused if there is alot of gunk on the floor. As they try to avoid it they end up running over it multiple times and take significant amount of damage figuring out how to behave (but they do snap out of it eventually) . yet, so far, this has only happened maybe 2-3 times in the many matches I have played and only seem to last for that room. its a rare occurance and will probably be patched at a later date.\n\n\nbut apart from that.....nothing of mention, the game is very well polished. very easily worth the asking price.","November 21, 2014","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The kind of experience that makes you want to arrange an in-person handshake. The gameplay is moment to moment satisfaction: your attacks make big loud noises whenever you smack a foe around, making the whole experience incredibly active. Not to mention the thrill of negotiating when to dodge, when to attack, what monster to take out first and what traps you THINK you can jump over. And all the while, big bright numbers are popping up whenever you score a hit, level up, collect gold, etc. The music builds and travels around you in a way that makes you feel like you're traveling further and further into something dangerous. Unlockables always make you want to play a second match, and there is an amazing amount of variety here for just ten dollars. All of the monsters and their evolution chains will bring a whole new slant to the way you fight, with some creatures bringing straight-up entirely NEW mechanics to gameplay that are exclusive to them. There's only one monster that can summon low level zombies. Only one monster that can heal itself and other monsters. Only one monster that can summon a gust of wind to move the hero into the path of a trap. Only one monster whose eye can be used as a weapon after you kill it! Bottom line, when love is behind the making of a game, you can tell right away. And the result is bombastically fun. Mighty fine balance that gives advantages to both being the ghost and being the hero, with both roles always presenting opportunities that will permanently better a player's position. The final boss is gorgeous and puts up a fight that will make you chomp your lip and raise your fist. This whole game will make you chomp your lip and raise your fist. Pummel-loving gameplay with an AD&D monstrous manual vibe that will make you smile.

I'd never seen or heard of the game before, but that pixel art drew me in close enough to click on it. Boy am I glad I did.\n\nIn Crawl you play as a ghost trying to murder your living friend, or a hero trying to survive your dead friends' onslaught. Hero's can explore the map, break things, buy weapons at the shop, open chests, and attempt to kill the monsters your friends summoned and are controlling. Ghosts can summon monsters when inside a pentagram, possess various kinds of traps throughout the dungeon, spawn slimes if they've collected enough ghost fluff (or whatever it is...), or even take control of a boss the hero is trying to kill.\n\nSo, the game starts as one of you randomly chosen as the first hero, who goes about the dungeon exploring rooms, and fending off friends who actively try to kill him. "Why?" You may ask. Well, the ghost that lands the killing blow on the hero regains their humanity and becomes the new hero, while the dead hero becomes a ghost. And the fight continues.\n\nThe hero progresses through the dungeon, leveling up by collecting experience from slain monsters. They can buy new weapons, which range from broadswords, to crossbows, to dual throwing knives; special abilities, which allow you to replace your starting dodge roll with better dodging abilities, beserker rage, and lasers; as well as potions and apparel that grant permenant effects like Dragon's Blood that lowers your max health, but makes you deal more damage. My personal favorite, Golem's Blood, which causes you to mave 10% slower, but raises your max health by 40%. Acid cursed rings that causes you to loose pools of acid every time you get hit to damage your attacker, or the shield that floats around you blocking damage altogether. Need some more gold? Cash in all the blood you took from the hero as a ghost to earn a ton of extra cash.\n\nOnce a hero reaches level 10 they can challenge the boss. The boss is also controlled by the ghosts, who work together to keep the hero from winning the game, because the boss slayer automatically wins first place. If defeated, the hero returns with low life, sure to die within the next few moments.\n\nNow, here's the catch. You can only challenge a boss three times before the portal permenently closes. If the hero loses here, not only do they automatically get last place, but they lose that character forever. Normally, even if your the ghosts and lose when someone beats the boss, your character profile is saved, and you can use them again next time. (with all abilities and weapons reset of course) Not if you lose to the boss the third time. If that happens, your gone forever. This allows you to sort of keep a win streak, or stay-alive streak rather. I can't wait to see how the devs use this in the future.\n\nNow, heros can level up, so how do the ghosts compensate? They can evolve their monsters. When a hero levels up, each ghost gets Vitae that they can spend evolving monsters when the hero completes a floor. There's lots of monster evolution chains and you can unlock even more. Before you start, each player chooses a deity to worship, which changes the kinds of monsters that are avalible to you as a ghost. Staying the hero for too long will yeild very powerful enemies for you friends, but stay a ghost for too long and you'll never have a shot at beating the game. The longer you stay a ghost, the more powerful your monters become compared to your friends, and the more powerful your monsters, the higher chance you have at landing the killing blow and becomeing the hero. You see? It's all ingeniously ballanced.\n\nYes I can recomend the game right now. Although there's only one boss and and a few deities. The devs are working on more. This is really good for an early access game.\n\nOn a side note, This game is Lovecraftian as heck. And I love it for that.\n\nOnly one issue with the game. It's local multiplayer only at this point. Not that I have a big problem with that, but...\n\n\nNow all I need is 3 people willing to sit around a computer screen to play with me :p\n\n8/10","August 7, 2014","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a fairly simple dungeon-crawler, yet it is very enjoyable. Very old-school, which is something I appreciate. In each round there are 4 players. Of these players, 3 are ghosts and 1 is a human. As a ghost, the objective is to work together with the other ghosts to slay the human. This can be done by turning into enemies, activating traps, and summoning blobs. When a human dies, the ghost who landed the killing blow then becomes the human. The goal is to stay human long enough to become level 10, after which you must find a portal and defeat a boss.\n\nPros and Cons:\n+ Simple to learn, yet hard to master\n+ Very addictive\n+ Great multiplayer\n+ Nonstop action, monster or human\n+ Well-balanced mechanics (monster strength, health, etc.)\n+ Old-school, classic video game feeling\n+ Well randomized, even with small details\n+ Lots of weapons\n+ BE THE MONSTER\n- No online multiplayer\n- Only 2 bosses\n\nAs you can see, I have few complaints about the game.

The monsters evolve after each floor, getting tougher and tougher, and eventuallly, they will kill you, you only get "xp" (or vitae, as its called ingame)  to evolve your monsters if the other players level up, so it has a massive competition side to it, if you survive the whole floor, and not be killed once, then you probably wont be able to evole your monsters.

The other players are getting the advantage... but not really, you have weapons, swords and bows and javelins/spears to fight them off, some quicker some slower but more damage, there are many, many many many weapons to this game to kill your undead enemies, atleast, i think there are.\n\n(plus theres assassins blades... so thats cool :D)\n\nEach time you finish a game, more content gets added (it of course tells you what once you beat it) like more weapons, traps, gods and more, so if theres not enough content for you, dont you worry there will be more.\n\nSo your a monster and you kill the player, whoever got the last blow turns into the human, and you got it, what do you do? go to the blacksmith shop, or find it, because every time you hit the player, you earn "blood" which you can give to a statue in the blacksmith shop. the statue is happy from the blood you spilled, and rewards you, with money, that you can use for weapons or purchase a "spell" that replaces your dodge roll.\n\nSo this game offers much, and is definatley worth ten bucks, infact i think that is a lower price than what this game offers, and the fact this game is going to ofer more in the future... well thats just great.\n\nSo welcome to the dungeons, Crawler","August 7, 2014","true","39.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In fact, I've played it everyday since I got it. It's a fast-paced game with great music, atmosphere, gameplay, and a lot of challenge without too steep a curve. I have only played with AI so far, and I still have a lot of fun. They feel like proper opponents, and help set the illusion that you're playing with people.\n\nI first used keyboard controls. They're alright; I wouldn't advise you slouch or curl up while playing though, as there's a lot of rapid button-pushing involved and that'll make your hands cramp up very quickly. I now use an iBuffalo Classic USB gamepad; the same goes for it, although that might just be because it's a new gadget and hasn't been broken in yet. Both control sets work great! Word to the wise, though: As of now, you can't adjust the gamepad controls in the main menu; you have to start a game and then use the controls menu that appears immediately after.\n\nThe developers are still working out the kinks, I imagine, and they're adding new content all the time. The brief story-like introductions have some great variety to them, and there's nothing more awesome than going through all the new monsters, weapons, and items you unlock after every game. I have no complaints!","May 24","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, instead of having a party of heroes, venturing into a dusty pit of doom, you have one hero and a party of evil ghosts, trying to kill him and thus take his place as the hero. The version I've played just before the early access started, had three evil gods to worship, each with his own set of horrible upgradeable monsters + tons of magic items for the hero to invest in, including madness inducing swords. And there's more to come!\n\nIf you love playing with a bunch of friends, this game gets my highest recommendation, even with the content at Early Access release. It's hours of fun for the price and the originality of the gameplay together with the charming blocky art style has already made this one of my favourite local multiplayer games on Steam.","August 7, 2014","true","8.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I posted some ideas in the forums that I think would make the game absolutely great and help balance out the late-game where heroes can get really overpowered and cause the game to drag on; but most everyone thinks their ideas are great, don't they?  A large selection of options like in Worms Armageddon and Super Smash Brothers may also boost replayablility and make each game more (or less) interesting.  Anyway, I would like to see that this game continues to develop and hope that it will get more balanced out.\n\nOverall, this game is a 9/10 and definitely worth getting if you've got a few friends to play a local co-op game with.

Check\n-Offer a variety of weapons and items to equip? Check\n-Offer varios monsters that can all be upgraded? Check\n-Have several weapons, monsters, items, and monster "loadouts" to unlock? Check\n-Do all of this while simultaeniously causing you to lose all of your friends? Check and Check!\n\nThis is a very fun game no matter if you are playing against AI or actual people. It is frantic fun that usally will have all who play on their toes. Defeat is sad, but encourages you to get your revenge, while victory encourages you to keep going as long as you can, just one more floor, just a little more gold, just one more shopkeeper.\n\nAlright, so to start, if you know Binding of Isaac or Enter the Gungeon, it plays like that with hack n' slash combat. What happens is a wonderfully crafted, simple yet effective backstory is given as to the what and why of the game. The 4 heroes (up to 4 players or 3 AI) become 1 while the other players(or AI) inhabit the spirits. It is the Hero's job to reach at least level 10 and kill the boss, all while surviving the traps and monsters that lurk in the dungeon. The hero also needs to stock up on various gear and weapons. The spirits are tasked with taking down the hero by means of possesing the traps and summoning runes that lay marked on the floor. Once they kill the hero, they then take on the role of hero, slayer of ghouls and the fiends they possess. Throughout the game, the hero levels up and sometimes gets rewarded with gold by finding interactive objects or dealing damage to the hero as sppirits. The spirits on the other hand evolve by earning their own currency gained by causing harm to the hero or when the hero levels up. It is something like that. It is a fun and rewarding back and forth game that is surprisingly well balanced with no bugs that I have encountered. I bought this game just a few days before I found it was also part of my Humble Monthly. I did not request a refund from steam for my purchase however because this game is easily worth the money I paid. I would recomend this game to anyone who has local buddies (or can play solo) and loves dungeon crawlers.\n\nThings it could improve would be to add online functionality, and more diversity to the level design (maybe make each chapter go with the theme the title implies of sorts) and just more content overall (though it is honestly not needed).\n\nGo give the game a chance!\n\nEdit: After spending more time in this game, my review still holds. If anything, I think higher of this game. It is truly something special. They have added new interactive intros to decide who the hero is, more voicework, and new monsters. I would like to add that more uniqueness to the monster evolutions would be nice as well as new bosses. One new boss is being worked on now, but some enemies share the same evolutions and though there is still plenty of variety, it is a little sad to see a unique spot currently wasted on something similar. I trust the developers will deliver, and if they dont, this game is still smashing (really really good).","May 7","true","12.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Crawl itself has a crazy simple design, looks and feels like an old arcade game (only 2 buttons, and one stick) I played with a controller and loved it (haven't yet tried the mouse). As simple as it was on paper, playing the hero took some work (monsters actually felt more responsive and intuitive, controllwise, than the hero), aiming ranged weapons took finesse, and missing a special or crucial attack because the target was moving around was heartbreaking, but  each time I moved to deny either my friend or the AI my precious humanity was a moment of absolute triumph. The cutscenes between hero death and the new hero entering the game gave the unfortunate loser a chance to exclaim thier losses, while the winner exclaimed thier victory.\n\nThe Games basic premise is refreshing, with 4 players all competeing for the chance to be a hero and defeat the boss. The switch off between being the hero, a monster, a trap and a ghost was enjoyable. Best moment was when I realized that the final boss was also controlled by the ghosts, and I took great pleasure in shooting my friend with a simple, but really enjoyable array of attacks. The ghosts will need to work together to take down the hero, because although they outnumber him, most of the time the hero has more health, and often does more damage (depending on monster level), when an AI hero battle began my friend and I would quickly talk strategy and each try to exploit the hero's predicament in order to land the final blow ourselves.\n\nThe chaotic and quick pace that ensued was enjoyed by all, and even though we didn't win the match, simply playing the game was enjoyable.  Finaly, after finishing the match we got to see the new items we unlocked for our next game, I can't wait to try and find them all.\n\nFor an early access game feels both polished, and nuanced.\n\n8.9/10, can't wait to see what this game becomes!","November 5, 2014","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat, the evolution system, the bosses and gods (both will be expanded upon in the not-so-distant future incidentally, or so the VERY friendly people behind this game are stating) all blend together to create a deep and enjoyable experience. Literally the only downside to this game is it's lack of an online multiplayer system, though for what it's worth the bots are very human like and responsive as well.\n\nSpecial shout out to the visual style of the game, it's simply fantastic, and the sound effects which make every attack seem to have a special kind of weight to it.\n\n8/10, as petty as it sounds I'd bump it up to an easy 9/10 if it had online multiplayer simply because this is the kind of game that goes so well with a crowd of friends to play it with, and many such as myself rarely have the time (or in my case even spare controllers) to get a group together and crowd around a computer screen.

Developed by the two man team over at Powerhoof, Crawl is a local co-op dungeon crawler for up to four players, and provides the answer to that very question.\n\nIn a rather interesting turn of events, one of you controls the hero, slaying monsters, gaining levels, and buying loot, while the other 3 players use ghosts to possess traps or summon monsters with the simple goal of killing you to become the hero instead. The point of Crawl is to survive long enough to reach level 10, then activating a portal to the final boss encounter. The player that reaches and defeats the final boss first wins the game.\n\nIf you have local friends who frequent your house, Crawl is an insanely good time. Its short 30-minute games, combined with its accessible pick-up-and-play control scheme, make it ideal for parties or for larger groups of people to pass the controllers around. However, if you’re running solo, you’ll most likely grow tired of fighting the A.I. rather quickly and there isn’t anything to do after that.\n\nFull review: http://wp.me/p2go2D-4Gd","August 6, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is probably my most anticipated Indie game title that I have ever purchased. The game has an extremely unique concept of being a dungeon crawler where other players play as the monsters. Tons of fun to play with friends who come over, considering the game does not have online capabilities.\n\nEven though the game is in early access, it still delivers a positive gameplay experience and has a lot of content. The developers spend a lot of time in the discussion forums reading over concerns and suggestions so that they can deliver the best possible gaming experience. I would say that the game is "safe" to buy during the early access stage, but is a must have once it is completely finished.","August 12, 2014","true","31.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not usually one to pick up early access games as I would prefer to play a finished project, but after seeing this on the Humble store, I  immediately fell in love with the pixel/glitch art style. I checked out the gameplay video and decided to give it a chance.\nCrawl starts up as if it's an old school arcade game, asking you to insert coin and enter you initials. Up to four players can play via couch co-op (no online unfotunately, but I think the fast paced gameplay lends itself better to local co-op) using keyboard, mouse or controllers. One player starts as the human character advancing through the dungeon collecting money, loot or finding the exit to the dungeon. The other three player take control of ghosts who can summon creatures or possess traps in the dungeon with the purpose of destroying the human character. Once a ghost player has killed the human player, they become the human. End game happens once a human character destroys the main boss.\nAs you progress, your character levels up and can buy weapons and equipment that change the way the game is played. In between levels, you can upgrade the monster creatures you send out as a ghost, making the game more difficult as you progress. It's very nicely balanced and I never felt like one player was too strong or weak against other players. While this game is meant to be played with multiple players, I found single player with bots surprisingly challenging, and at times forgot I was playing against the computer.\nI highly recomend Crawl if your looking for a frantic couch co-op game to play with your friends, or just looking for a fast paced arcade style game to play by yourself. With the added promise from the developers of more creatures, dungeons, and items to be added in the future, as well as the $10 price tag, you really can't go wrong with this one.","August 9, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The team work potential of Spirits to destroy The Hero, using the huge number of combinations of items, monsters, and traps that exist gives the game a lot of replay value.\n\nA few parts beautiful graphics, several parts chaotic action, one part slow motion, Crawl is a great game that will (probably) cement your bonds of friendship with friends.\n\nClever trash talk not included.","August 10, 2015","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play as the monsters to regain your humanity or fight as a human to keep your humanity. This extremely unique multiplayer experience cannot be overlooked.

It's really fast-paced and you go from being an aggressive villain to a defensive hero within seconds! Matches last about 30 minutes and the competitive and tense nature of these matches really is fun. Local multiplayer games are not very common on PC but this really works. I also love the aesthetics! The art style and animations are very smooth and reminescent of older games mechanics-wise. 9.5/10! I love this game.\n\nOnly improvement would be to adjust the pacing of the AI when in singleplayer, as soon as they are level 10 they try the boss, I wish they'd wait a little bit to get upgrades first.","August 11, 2014","true","21.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The idea and setting of the game is utterly marvelous. Not only creeping through a dungeon with your friends trying to cause your downfall, but with care, they can take that delicious chance of freedom from you is so very entertaining. I personally love the art style, it's suitable and really helps set the theme for this dark dungeon crawl. The controls are simple, yet very satisfying, every strike with a blade and every dodge to spare your life is as satisfying as any. Not to mention the monsters you encounter, some you love and some you hate, but that makes you fight so much harder just to make sure you do not see your grinning friend shout in success as he steals your humanity. Though many people have complained about an online functionality, I understand however am not too upset by it. If there is not going to be an online function however, I would like to see some improvements to the AI. Often I've found the AI to act in peculiar ways, like they're on a cycle, letting another AI or player get away with things completely at certain times and it's tremendously obvious when they do so. I'd like to see the AI be a little more dynamic and not quite so inclined to help each other, it is a desperate fight for freedom after all. Aside from that however, so far into the Early Access I am loving the game, and hope many more do. Absolutely  worth the price, and the fun to be had.","May 27, 2015","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Crawl is a co-op(or single player with bots) retro arcade simulator fantasy dugeon crawler. Aiding yourself with powerups, spells and abilities, and tons of unique weapons, the hero must fight through levels and levels of dungeon against player coltrolled monsters. As you get stronger, so do the monsters. As a human player your goal is to reach level 10 and kill the boss(which is also player controlled). However, everyone else plays the roll of the monsters and traps in the dungeon which constantly evolve and become more and more difficult. If you are killed you become a ghost and your killer becomes the hero. See where this is going? This game has competition and rage written all over it. One can play a quick game within 15-20 min, but the longer the game lasts the more exiting it tends to be. The developers are constantly releasing new content and making the game better and better with each update.

Ok first of if you enjoy classic 8 bit style games or their modern counterparts such as Terraria, Risk Of Rain, Super Meat Boy, Shovel Knight, then I would take good hard look at Crawl.\n\nWhat's so fun about it? For one it has a very fitting, nostalgic, well made soundtrack. You're given many controller options and the controls them selves are very simple and In addition, are very responsive. They don't feel goofy or sloppy. *UNLESS* you choose to use the mouse as your controller, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nThe level design is randomized, you will never play a game and feel like you've been on a particular level before, it just doesn't get old. The scenery always seems fresh.\n\nThe game is stable I've played around 37 hours so far and bugs as well as crashes are rare. It's most likely not a game you're going to be frustrated by because it crashes every 20 minuets.\n\nThe AI is actually very enjoyable to play with, it's surprising how clever they can be at times which provides a highly entertaining experience. With few bugs to mention besides occasionally getting trapped it's a great addition which allows you to play offline any time.\n\nI could go on about the large selection of weapons, unique items, buffs, monsters, mini bosses, bosses, statues, traps. But that would take a long ♥♥♥ time.  To keep this short, In the end, for $10 this game is dripping with content, and quality, and fun times.\n\nThe only thing that I'd warn of, is that the game isn't online multiplayer, only local multiplayer (as in) you plug in 4 controllers to one computer and you can play with 4 friends like a console.\n\nOnline would be a great addition but it's not currently avalible.","April 24, 2015","true","78.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of the best games I've ever played. This is an addictive, competitive, dungeon crawler that will keep you on the edge of your seat when fighting friends. Most of the monsters seem balanced and are very fun to use.\n\nHowever...\n\nMonsters Problems- The Green Shaman monster thing that summons the zombies need to be nerfed to hell and back. It's very very fast, and has so much health. Not to mention that the slime it leaves behind slows you down so much it's not even a fun challenge. The tentacle things need to have slightly lower health and weak attacks also. The one that is able to go underground and then come back up and attack you is way too ogrepowered. It need to have lower health or do less damage, or not be able to go underground as often. The other one's not as bad, but the tentacles it makes come from the ground are SUPER bulky and take up the whole screen! The minotaur that stems from the rat monster needs to be slower or have a longer recharge on it's sprint. I'm really good with a bow and it frustrates my friends when I kill them because they can't even reach me due to me speeding around the map so often. Other than these specific monsters, I can't really think of anything else in the monster catagory.\n\nBoss Problems- Kourok needs to have more health and need to be stronger. Something about Kourok needs to be stronger because anytime someone activates the portal, it's either guarunteed death, (Ghidraak) or a free pass to beat the game. Kourok is nowhere near as strong as Ghidraak and is too easy of a boss. Ghidraak is WAY TOO STRONG! I have probably beaten this boss maybe 3-4 times when fighting it. It is incredibly overpowered in full dragon form, but the fact that EACH INDIVIDUAL HAED GETS THEIR OWN LIFE AFTER DETACHMENT completely breaks the game. You struggle through enough with fighting the boss. Some people are probably saying "That's why the healer is there!", but it doesn't matter! Even if the healer doesn't get hit AT ALL to where he doesn't run away, he only drops 3-4 health orbs at the MOST. It MIGHT be okay for Ghidraak's head to each have a second chanceif their ealth wasn't so high. Their health is the same as if not more that it takes to knock it off of the dragon body in the first place.\n\nPLEASE PLEASE POWERHOOF! FIX GHIDRAAK!!!! PLEASE! The ending of the game literallly depends on if the human gets Ghidraak or Kourok, and that's really unbalanced and unfair. It needs to come down to the players skill, and no matter how much skill you have, it's near impossible to kill Ghidraak, even without competant playuers. (I just ten minutes ago fought Ghidraak and was versing an "easy" bot, and lost. I am very good at this game and have played for wuite a while.

Not sure what my play time will show on my account but I've played more than it will show. We own a ton of games in this genre. The local co-op, retro, throw everyone in the ring and fight each other type games. Stuff like Towerfall, Samurai Gunn, Gang Beasts, Nidhogg, BroForce Deathmatch, etc. Theey're a great style of game for when you have friends over. Everyone can grab a controller and get right to the fun. No wasting time. Crawl adds to this genre in a big way.\n\nThe concept is pretty genius. 1 player controls the hero while 3 other players control ghosts which can "pocess" traps and mobs while the hero runs from room to room in the dungeon. The fun exists because the hero needs to kill the monsters to collect XP and level up. Once he gets to 10 he needs to find the portal room and portal to the boss. At which point the 3 other players take pocession of different parts of the boss and try to take out the hero and send everyone back into the dungeon. The catch comes when a ghost kills the boss, he then becomes the hero and tried to level up his hero to 10. There are many other things to consider while leveling. Finding blood and turning it in to merchants sos you can buy weapons and spells and potions. Ghosts collect points to level up the monster they can transform into in certain rooms in the dungeon.\n\nThe whole game put together keeps everyone engaged and in it to win it not matter how far behind. First time playing my guy hit level 10 first but I never made it to the boss through the portal room. Another guy made it to the boss several times and died. The guy who ended up winning was in last the entire match.\n\nI generally do not do EA but this one is a gem. This one should be fun to play for a long time as long as you have some people around to play with.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/Cj8nZXmg8UY","January 11, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The players will be competing for gold and experience while traversing a dungeon. One player will spawn as the hero, and the remaining players will start as ghosts. The currently alive player will move from room to room, coming across pentagrams in most rooms. The ghosts can activate these to summon one of 3 monsters chosen in a kit at the start of the game.\n\nShould a ghost deal the killing blow on the player, they spawn as the hero and must continue the dungeon! Each floor has a shop and boss ring the player can interact with, as well as other wishing wells and a few other entitys to work with.\n\nThe combat is fun, there's plenty of weapons the store offers, plenty of artifacts to modify the character, as well as spells to get from the shop.\n\nPros:\nA fun (currently local) fighting game for friends to challenge each other in.\nPlenty of weapons to choose from, a good bit of item variation.\nLots of unlocks to encourage replayability.\nChallenging bosses that force the ghost/players to work together to kill the hero/player\nMore content to come!\nThe combat is solid and fun.\nNice design for a minimalist/pixel game.\n\nCons:\nWhile maps are randomly generated, there isn't any difference in backgrounds or themes at this time of review\nThe sound is very harsh and not appeasing at all.\n\n","January 1","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This is definetly a game you should play with your buddies. It is a dungeon crawler, but the most authentic and unusual one you have ever played. And you know what? It works out really well. The pixelart looks awesome and I really dig the music which fits the artstyle perfectly. Really cool music and presentation and I didn't even get to the gameplay. This dungeoncrawler lets you fight against your friends. Your friends are actually the enemy, not the AI as it usually would be in a coop game. At first, all the players fight against each other and the last one alive gets to "crawl" the dungeon while his friends try killing him as all sorts of mobs. The variation is really surprising, you play a fish, a undead, a samurai and so much more. Those are the opponents of the human player. As soon as one of the dead players kills the human one, he gets to be human. This sounds really weird but it totally works and is probably lots of fun together. I really love that the game finishes so complete. The animations in the menu alone are cool with the music.","May 21","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Of all of the roguelike, couch co-op indie games out there, Crawl has to be my favourite. The atmosphere of the game is just creepy enough to send the willies up newcomers, not to mention the new intro cutscenes narrated by the magnificent Old Shrimpeyes. I don't know what that man eats, drinks or starves himself of to get that kind of voice, but whatever it is, I want it.\nIntro and Atmosphere aside, Crawl is just a boatload of fun to play. I picked up the Steam Link recently and said box of goodness has proven itself to be quite good at processing these pixel-style games. It's situated in my living room, so I of course went on to have a real couch co-op experience with a few mates which consisted mainly of ghostly noises and violent screaming. The graphics are great, especially when running at 60fps as you get to watch the current human shifting fearfully from hall to hall before being set upon by rats, spiders and goblin grasshopper thingies, all of which are controlled by either bots or the people sitting next to you.\nThe best part is, if you haven't been human for a while, you gain Wrath every time the lucky fellow levels up, which in turn allows you to evolve your goblin grasshopper thingy into a rock-lobbing giant. This system of EXP for the living and Wrath for the dead makes the game a lot fairer and keeps things interesting in a long runthrough.\nOverall, I'd recommend Crawl for anyone hankering for some old fashioned jolly cooperation; I can't remember what I bought it for because I was a pre-release funder, but whatever it costs now, it's worth it!","June 6","true","33.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So many hidden references and jokes, but yet incripted, et cetera as to stay in the same atmosphere, its mechanics, and gampeplay, and just about everything I can think of about this game is perfect. I mean, to think it is only £7, to think that it is only early access, well, in the future I cant even think on how they can improve the perfect, but Im sure Those 2 creative people down there will find a way, for whatever choice they make, even if they poke fun at a real religion, would be done in such a way nobody would care! The concept of the game is, when you start, everything is glitchy. >:D. Ok, so, it causes a good unsettlement at the start, thats ok. then you start playing with a friend. And then you realise the TRUE PERFECTION THE GAME IS!!!! I mean, I have a friend who owns it, and I am sharing it using the steam library, but I AM SO BUYING THIS GAME ANYWAY! You start as one of you a human, entering a place, and walking around, when there are pentagrams. Your friend, a ghost, goes up to them AND BECOMES A MONSTER AND YOU FIGHT AND THE MONTER KILLS YOU, AND THEN THE MONSTER BECOMES A HUMAN AND YOUR THE GHOST!!! THEN YOU LEVEL UP AND KEEP ON DOING THE SAME THING, AS DIFFERENT MONSTERS, AND THEN YOU GO TO THE NEXT FLOOR AND EVOLVE THEM UNTIL YOU BEAT A BOSS AND WIN! Unfathomably great, atmospheric and suiting music, insrutably satifsying and fun gampeplay, concept, et cetera. All in all, I rate this game: 11/8. Must buy. as soon as I get the money I am going to get another game for my own.

Apr. 2015:\n\nSince my last "review" the game has already doubled in size of content and it is constantly getting better, still being in "work in progress" state.\n\nEverytime I start the game just to have a quick match and take a look at whats new I end up playing 4 or 5 matches and forcing my self to quit playing. This game is fun! Even in single player mode playing against bot enemies!\n\nSo if you like couch coop games, I'd definately say "go for it!".","November 19, 2014","true","27.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It is a game which you can play with your other 3 friends-or bots if you have less friend, offline by using keyboard, mouse and two joysticks. One to be a hero and the other contrl the creeps(read the game instruction). It is not only kill their contrling creeps, but also cooperate with your other creeps which your friend's contrling,  against the hero to slow him go furder and earn the blood to upgrade your creeps, or just kill him-when you think he is suck, too weak in the other word- to be a hero-then you will be the hero. The hero would upgrade- of course -and also can buy the magic, item, weapon and so on to be more stronger. When the hero upgrade to lvl10, the hero can activate the charm to teleport to the final boss room. The boss would be contrled by other players, cooperate to kill the hero. If the boss kills the hero, the game will continue, otherwise, game over, the hero who kills the boss wins. The charm can only activate 3 times, after 3 times, game over also (I forget who will win in this case because no boss alives in our hands). Its really fun to play with your friends, more players, more passionate. Really, really worth to play. Go buy it and play with your girl friend now, and you will break up by my will, ha-ha.\nCHINESE\n先说，这游戏值得一玩。这是一个4人游戏，跟朋友一起玩特别嗨，除非你的朋友很少，那你可以跟电脑玩儿。这游戏就是一个人扮演英雄，其他人扮演怪。具体游戏是什么个玩法，自己看游戏介绍。我想说的是，这不只是一个杀怪的游戏，怪之间要懂得配合，把英雄当BOSS打。或者说，你觉得这英雄太菜了，就干掉他（抢人头！），自己当英雄。怪可以靠攻击英雄打出的伤害获得BLOOD来升级，英雄可以击杀怪物获得经验升级，然后获取金币去商店购买物品、魔法、武器等等用来加强自己的东西。10级之后就可以激活符咒开BOSS房打BOSS了，总共有3次挑战BOSS的机会，控制怪的玩家控制BOSS攻击英雄，杀了他之后会损失一次挑战BOSS的机会。谁干掉了BOSS，就谁赢。要是3次全失败，呃，反正我们没有失败过3次我不知道会发生啥事。跟基友们一起玩特别基情，人越多越基情，真心值得一玩。快买买买，然后跟你女朋友玩儿去。然后就会正如我所愿的分手的。哈-哈。","October 29, 2015","true","9.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","3","5","3","0"

I found it by scrolling down some Local-multiplayer games and it caught my eye. It looked beautiful as a retro styled game. As I have some nearby friends who can't just go out and buy things on Steam so we could just play online, this local game, is perfect! The game is simple too! Theres 2 buttons, 1 for attack and the 2nd one for a spell or dodge. There are many ways you can buy, so that each item you find you wonder 'how will this come to my advantage'. I recommend this game for you if you're looking for a good simple local-player game!","October 17, 2014","true","8.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Like a normal Dungeon Crawler, you go from room to room fighting off monsters. However in Crawl, the players play as the monsters, all trying to attack the main player. The goal of the game as a monster is to kill the human player and take their place, while the goal of the human is to kill as much as possible and gain XP points. You win the game if you're the player and you go into the boss room and destroy the boss. (The other players also control the boss too!) However, you may only do this at level 10. If the players fail to slay the boss 3 times, the player who fought the third time is removed from the game forever. (And I'm not kidding, it actually deletes your name!)\n\nIf you have friends locally, this is for you. Just grab a couple of controllers. And no, unlike 70% of steam games with controller support, it DOESN'T need to have XInput. The devs of this game were sure to incorporate as much controllers as possible. As long as it has a USB that you can stick into your computer the controller probably works. Did I mention the game only uses 3 buttons and a d pad? (2 not including the start button) Haven't tested it, but this should work in theory: http://www.amazon.com/Classic-USB-NES-Controller-PC/dp/B002YVD3KM\n\nIf you want one of the best local play experiences you'll ever have, buy now. Also the game devs are really active in the community pumping out updates like mad.\n\nPositive Features:\n-Up to 4 Players Locally\n-Single player mode with AIs\n-TONS of controller options\n-Innovative control scene\n-Active Devs (As of now)\n-Low Price\n-High Repeatability\n-Cabinet mode (You may hook the game up to an arcade machine!)\n\nNegative Features:\n-No online support yet. May not come for a while. Don't buy the game hoping for online support, it's clearly not it's focus, although it may come in the future.\n\n\nOverall, this game is wonderful locally. If you're having a party or just inviting friends over, this is a must have. It's still fun with bots, but not as good with other people, I haven't played much single player but I know it's kind of a mixed response, some like it and some don't. I like it though.\n\nAlso you can fight Gabe Newell. He hits you with his custom skinned digital knives. 10/10","February 6","true","45.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It creates some really fun tims with friends even if it's not online multiplayer, and has unlimited replay-ability. But now for my recomendations to the developers. I beilive 3 things are needed to make this game even better than it already is, the first is just simply more enemies, bosses, and items, however I know that those are all in development already anyway. The second is online multiplayer, but that is a very time-consuming feature and maybe not worth it in the long-run. The third is a new team mode, where there is 2 humans at once, both of them with weakend health, and sharing gold though. And of course 2 monsters, both on the same team. So that when you kill one of the humans the other one also dies and swtiches to the monster, and both monsters become humans. This would make a really fun addition to the game, with the enjoyment of fighting against even AI with your freind on your team. And I think this should seriously be condisidered to add an awesome new element to an already amazing game.","June 7, 2015","true","23.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Interesting competitive mechanic where everything changes and you want to be the guy to kill the hero, for a chance to win yourself. Graphics are colourful and the monsters and scenery are well designed. It's satisfactory even as a dungeon crawl, with weapons to upgrade and artifacts of power.\nBest played in a 4 player group, but it still works with less players. And played in single player against bots it's not that bad either.\n\nRecommended for it's original gameplay mechanics in a "you get to be the bad guys" style.","August 5, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/twist3dlogic/recommended/293780/","twist3dlogic","TwistedLogic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/twist3dlogic/","325 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA great concept of a game carefully crafted and bundled into an easily set up multiplayer game. There is character progression, adversity which shifts constantly as other players take the role of the hero and the others take the role of the monsters trying to turn him into floor paste and some great bosses which allow for some nice action.\n\nOverall, a solid concept. Now the reason for the no recommendation;\n\nI played local multiplayer with a bot or two (not having more than one other person immediately available) and the result was a frantic scrabble after the AI, trying to figure out what to do. This itself did not take long, but the frantic scrabble continued on and on and on. Normally, frantic in a game is good, but this just felt like always playing catch-up and never progressing. At the end of each floor, regardless of character advancement, it always felt like we were not quite sure what had been achieved, what happened or what we were even trying to do. We continued on for a while, had a few boss encounters and played as both the monsters and hero a few times each. It was around the time my friend said "I'm bored" that I realized that I was too and had just been forcing fun onto the session.\n\nThe ghost characters constantly felt like they were dragged from room to room, rather than chasing the hero, often never having the chance to even attempt the various awesome traps in the corridoors between some of the rooms. The blob drops were a nice touch, enabling the ghosts to stay in the action, but not overwhelm the hero too much with mobs. But it still felt a bit bland and it was hard to relate to any of the characters with the constant control switch (mostly with the AI bots getting in there 9 times in 10). Overall, for two of us playing with two bots, it was not fun.\n\nOther people with three friends to play with may very well have an awesome time with Crawl, but I think it needs a little more balance, maybe some humor or something, anything to bring it to life. Players need something to work with to get fun out of a game. Other than that, the devs have done an awesome job (love the boss intros, they looked awesome!) and I hope I get chance to have fun with this in the future.","September 27, 2014","false","0.6"," 91 of 182 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","91","182","5","5"

It starts out great.. you trucking along and oh.. whats this portal.. hmm level 10 to use portal gotchya... then you make to level 10.. omg portal takes you to boss ... ok... kill boss... game over... 10 mins... beat the game... wtf i have only played the game for 1.8 hours and i have beat it like 6 times.\n\ni get that this is supposed to be more of a couch game and a multiple person game but the bots do a good job.\nThe game play is fun. upgrading weapons is fun. and the currency system feels great.\n\nbut the game is SOOOOOO short. i was super pumped that the game was level based... then you kind of realize that each level is kind of the same... and it almost seems like they are random generated. so there is no outside... there is no travel or anything like that.  i would have loved to see this in a more open style with armor upgrading aswell.. toss in a minor storyline and some different worlds and more bosses and you have youself a hell of a game.\n\n\nso... overall i would still recommend it... but i feel like 10 dollars is too much... 4 dollars seems more legit for the amount of gameplay you actually get out of it. but still pick it up for the expirence lol","April 9, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

Lo and behold, it was on Steam! I immediately bought, noticing it had a single-player feature as well, something that appealed to me, since I don't have the best Internet in the world. After the fast download, I played it for the first time.\n\nWow! I had seen gameplay for this game on Youtube, but I never thought it would be soo much fun! Even against the AI, the game itself has a simple yet challenging playstyle to it that I love, and the music and graphics match so well with the action the game can offer!\n\nI have few complaints, to be honest. Normally, I would have a number of them, seeing as this is Early Access, but I only have a few.\n\nFirst, it just seems so short. Eight floors just seems so small for a game. But it is in Early Access, so I could understand why.\n\nSecondly, while I enjoyed what I saw so far (I managed to play the AI into losing his Humanity, which was satisfying), maybe adding different kinds of surroundings, like mossy dungeons or dark, dank caves would be possible. It'd be interesting to see how a fight against a mindflayer (or hentai tentacle beast, either way, they're pretty interesting) would go in a cave with floor-to-ceiling rock formations here and there.\n\nAnd lastly, the weapon selection. While the weapons are useful in different situations, it just seems kinda boring to swing a sword or throw some daggers around. Maybe adding a bow or possibly a staff is possible? It'd certainly change how players played the game.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a great game to play with your friends. Everyone is involved in not just the dungeon-crawling levels, but also the final boss, which was pretty interesting.\n\nI've never seen a game like this before, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing how much more is going to go into this game!\n\nEDIT:\n\nAfter playing the game a few more times, I realized that it DOES include other weapons, as well as other monster elvolutions. My bad for not playing more of the game and securing my knowledge. All it takes is a completion of the game as either the human or the spirit, and those new unlockables are given to you before heading back to the main menu.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nI'm forgetting or overlooking quite a bit in this game, apparently. I recently discovered a spirit-usable statue feature, which allows spirits to become strong, high-level monsters that would normally be available through monster evolution. It's a pretty interesting concept, and one I kind of dread. A low level player can quickly be eradicated by one of these monstrosities, but the battles are tense and hectic.\n\nAs for other features, I noticed that there are a number of other weapons that are unlocked through continuous play, such as javelins and clubs. Once again, makes play throughs a bit more interesting as time goes on.","August 28, 2014","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It actually succesfully replicates the old retro feel of games.\nSitting down with a couple of friends, and having a good time. The mechanics of this game are great as well. The fac that you can evolve your monsters and hero keeps the game fun and exciting. Also, being given only 3 chances for the play to defeat the boss. It provides an insentive to keep playing through the floors even after you reach level 10 so you can truly defeat the boss. Another cool thing that you don't really see is players being able to controll the boss. This allows for cooperative fun even though it is the final.\nOverall, this game is fun and I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a retro style game.","October 11, 2014","true","6.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It is still in development though, but the devs have done a superb job of keeping in touch with their community and letting them know about what it is they're doing and planning to do. Content is released at an acceptable pace as well. They're a shining example of how these titles should be handled, at the moment. I've enjoyed this game immensely and that's without being able to get people together to play it with me on a regular basis. That's right, I'm having fun playing against the AI. I'm not saying that the AI is in anyway extraordinary, but I just find the game itself so fun that I don't mind playing by myself, even though this game shines the brightest with friends.\n\nAs of right now I can recommenced this game to anyone looking for a unique game concept and a fun party game.","November 19, 2015","true","33.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Singleplayer is nigh unplayable, especially given the poor tutorials, and the game is entirely designed around multiplayer, so no online option just brings this down to a wasted purchase.\n\nI know netplay is a difficult thing for indies to add, but when the entire game revolves around it, and it's the #1 thing requested for over a year of early access, it really needs to be a priority. Especially in the PC market, local only is baffling for an entirely multiplayer game.\n\nWill revise review if netplay becomes available, otherwise, absolutely do not recommend.","December 23, 2015","false","0.2"," 26 of 66 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","26","66","0","1"

Very, very fun.  Any criticism I have is in no way a deal-breaker.\nPros:\n- Balance: Lots of attention seems to be paid to keeping it interesting w/ the power dynamic between players constantly shifting.  Getting your minions' butts kicked? You'll rank up monsters faster. Spent a bunch of time running around as the hero killing everyone else? Now you're reincarnated as an toothpick spitting inchworm. All this is done without feeling like it's simply picking on the person in the lead.\nADDITIONALLY, the end-game is satisfying regardless of outcome since everyone both worked for and against it the entire time.\n- Pace: I'm impressed how well it allows for a leveling and item system while still keeping the gogoGOGOGO!GO!GO! mentality.  There always seems to be something for everyone to be doing.\n- Mood & Atmosphere: The glitched out voice acting brings me right back to scratchy copies of Golden Axe played on poorly tracking TVs.  Pixel graphics can be an aquired taste, but I think it fits well and this game puts a cool spin on it (this kind of "possessed game cartridge").\n\nCons (somewhat minor, but I hope can be addressed as the game develops )\n- Player confusion: With the unsaturated color palette it can be easy to lose track of your player.  This gets harder during big brawls when some people may be controlling the same type of minion.  Regardless, the learning curve is small.\n- Advancement & Unlocks: As it stands, the item and "God" unlocks after a session seem arbitrary.  Currently, they seem to be coming out of the glitched-out ether of the game (which is cool mood-wise), but it might be nice to see as least know what's triggering them - Are they indeed random? Tied to playtime? In-game exploration?\n\nI've only played this a few hours but it is already well worth the price - for the single player experience, let alone the strong party game this is!","January 16, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was slightly difficult for them to pick up the mechanics of the game and once they realized what was going on it was a little late.\n\nI only went through this game about 3 times so a little salt needs to be had here and I know I didn't unlock everything yet.\n\nGripes:\nThe game itself is fun and competitive but most of the time it was a little too one sided.\n\nOnce you pick up permemant stats from merchants it starts going down hill pretty quick for the opposing monsters because by the time you get the next merchant, you have at least died once and switch back again after (because they can't buy permenant stats on the same floor they have to fight off the next level of mobs on the new floor.) It was resolved quickly when blood fountains started to appear more often in the first rooms (They act as teleportation to merchant's room.) But by that time player who got ahead first early pretty much kept a mile lead.\n\nPostive notes about the game:\nThe game has a small decent variety of weapons/spells/items, as you play the it through a couple of times the game unlocks more items/mobs/spells you can use in the next game which keeps it interesting. Mini-bosses are fun to play as.\n\nSomethings I would tweak about the game.\nTraps slightly more visible for players (it's mostly for the ghoul's benefit.) Sometimes I can run into a room and friends would not see the traps they could posses after their mob form has been defeated.\n\nI was just thinking it would be better if there was gameplay option tweaks, speeds, respawnable items or demon circles, changing the RND for chests/mini-bosses/traps, how many ectoplasm slimes can be held by ghouls, stuff like that.\n\nPossible additions to the game:\nDeath pits! Lava bits! Water world. (Different wall sprites, it does get monotonous after 11 floors to see the same green decaying stone walls.)\nHolster/switch weapons? Most game controllers have more than 4 buttons...\nThrow mechanic for player? Throw props? Hide in them?\nHolding more than one spell? Requires switching delay.\nMore than one final boss?","December 5, 2014","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great music and visual imo. Gameplay is in a top down dungeaon crawling game. Main advantage it has is that it is very different compared to other couch multiplayer games. One person is the "hero" whilst others are ghosts going down levels of a dungeon.\nHero\nThe aim of the hero is to level up to level 10, activate the portal and defeat the boss monster. The hero can also buy stuff from the black smith and store including weapons, buffs and special ability items.\nGhosts\nThe aim of the ghosts is to kill the hero and therefroe become the new hero. They do this by possessing traps and activating pentagrams to become monsters in the dungeon. The ghosts get viae points by other heroes leveling up to spend on evolving their monsters. Their is a good variety of monsters as of v0.3 with more to come. When the monsters hurt the hero they earn blood which they convert to gold to buy stuff when they are the hero.\nBoss\nOnce a hero reaches level 10 they can activate a portal on a dungeon floor, with each floor's portal only allowed to be activated once, to fight the boss. The boss is controlled by the ghost players, eg one boss hass two tentacles and a head  making three control points and one boss has three different heads. If the hero dies they are shunted out. The boss can be fought three times total in a match until the games end.\nNO signs of online multiplayer anytime soon but I don't mind as the game has decent AI and I prefer them spend time adding more environements, creatures and bosses.\n\nIn the end I would recommend this game if you want a multiplayer game such as towerfall, samurai gun, gang beasts etc mixed with dungeon crawling rouguelike gameplay and assymetric multiplayer like evolve or nintendo land games.","January 19, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics really aren't too bad, and besides, I vastly prefer well-made 2D graphics to fuzzy, badly made 3D graphics any day. Very fun gameplay, and I like the fact that you can, for once play as the traps as well as the monsters.\n\nMy only real problem with this game is the aiming, and the fact whatever you are shooting goes whichever way you are facing. This makes ranged monsters/heroes feel uncontrollable at times. I would like to see some more content, such as new monsters and equipment, as well as maybe a couple of new traps. I also think the Gatekeeper is a bit easy, and could perhaps have some more health.\n\nApart from that this game is AWESOME! I highly recommend it to anyone who likes dungeon crawl games, as well as Dungeons and Dragons players. By which I mean, of course, PROPER D&D, the Pen and Paper games, not that stupid Neverwinter game made by Perfect World. That game sucks.\n\nAnyway, DEFINITELY a reccomendation.

The concept, gameplay and art style were all so fresh and unique that I was immediately hooked by this game. There are too few games in the world today that evoke the same emotions as the quest involved in playing a round of Crawl with your friends.\nFirstly, as an early access game, I was astonished when I picked this up because I found little to no glitches or bugs and it was bursting with content right from the start. The community is also very much alive and the developers are simply phenomenal, always keeping you updated as to their progress and ideas for the game.\nThe gameplay is like nothing I've ever played with up to 4 players playing locally (3 as ghosts and one as a hero) attempting to become a level 10 hero and defeat the dungeons boss. The catch is that since there is only one hero at a time, if you are not playing as the hero, you are one of the 3 ghosts controlling the dungeons minions, traps and bosses attempting to kill the hero and whomever deals the killing blow becomes the next hero.\nGames are generally fast-paced and frenetic yet the overall game round can take up to 30-40 minutes to play through depending on the players experience levels. The fact that the game is truly semi-cooperative in nature at all times is wonderful and keeps player interaction high. This is what makes local multiplayer gaming so wonderful to me and Crawl really delivers on that front. Many gamers have argued that they wished this game offered online support, and while I understand that not everybody has the opportunity to play with 4 players locally I really don't think this game would deliver the same experience if it were being played with people miles away on the internet instead  of your friends and family on the couch next to you.\nWhile I absolutely love this game and how unique and just plain fun it is the one major frustration for me would have to be the fact that the monster who deals the killing blow becomes the next hero and not the monster who dealt the most damage or some other qualifier. This just seems unintuitive, unfair and unrewarding to the non-hero players and I really think this should at least be an alternative option for the game settings if not the standard. I have discussed this with other gamers and while I understand their points as to how making it the player who deals the last blow can work as a balancing mechanism for weaker players I've seen it create just as much imbalance and more importantly change the flow of play to where camping is encouraged for monsters so that they can prepare themselves to deal the killing blow instead of simply attack the hero relentlessly. I truly believe that there should at least be an alternative option available in the settings for the monster who dealt the most damage to become the hero because I find it silly for a game to inherently make one of its mechanics just frustrating for the players  and immediately turn them off the excitement.\nDespite my one major criticism I have seldom found a game whose development has excited me as much as this one and I really hope that the developers consider my opinions on the game. Overall Crawl is definitely a game worth checking out for any gamer who wants to experience a new and exciting type of game and I highly recommend it if like me you are a huge fan of local multiplayer games that appeal to that childhood sense of playing arcade games and other video games side to side with your friends and family before the lonely Online Gaming era.\n","October 27, 2014","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're losing half the experience.\n- Nothing is as menacing as a fat fish shimmying towards you.\n- Remember to chant "Spoooooooky" whenever you're in ghost form. No, it doesn't get old, ever, and don't let the others tell you otherwise.\n- Amass ghost blobs and deploy jelly monsters to assert your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ status. Best practice includes:\n** Deploy blob before the player wishes to leave the room or travel down stairs.\n** Whenever the human player enters the boss chamber, deploy every jelly. Watch them swarm him while the cut-scene plays.\n- Don't underestimate the small floppy fish and its pew-pew stick projectile. It is the Magicarp of this game. By god, you don't want to die from Splash.\n- Most monsters let you leave trails of colored fluids.

The game mechanic and design is just wonderfully put together and work realy well even in this stage of the game.\nThere is a lack of content, you realy have to say that, but content is just a thing to be patched in and nothing of consern when the artstyle, the music, mechanics and gamedesign are allready perfect.\nIn my 2 hours of playing i also only encountered one singel bug, impressing.\nYou may not play this game for more then say 2 or 3 rounds in a row (one round is a bit longer then 30 minutes) but its still worth the 10 bucks as you and your friends will be drawn back to it.\nBesides, this game looks, feels and sounds just AMAZING.\n\nOne final thing to the developers (maybe they are reading this) , the solution for not having a minimap as there is allready so mutch going on UI wise is absolutely genious, why have i never seen this before in any dungeonCRAWLer? Realy well done.\nYou allways know exactly where you are and where to go, the problem is that this doesnt realy allow for bigger complex or maze like dungeons but thats allright in my books as this game is more focused on the multiplayer aspect.","August 8, 2014","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a great local co-op party game!  I'm not even sure what to compare it to...\n\nIt's a dungeon crawl (get it?) but only one person is the hero at a time.  The other people play the monsters.  When they kill the hero, they become the hero who then joins the monsters.  As you level up, you level/upgrade your hero and your monsters at the same time.  You basically play until the game ends one way or another (hero wins or monster wins).  The winner is the person scored the most points along the way.\n\nThe pixel graphics are beatiful.  The whole feel of the game is nostalgic, yet fresh at the same time.  It only takes a few moments to figure out what is going on.  The polish on this game is already amazing (even in the early access phase).  It's already a complete game in my opinion, but I can't wait to see what content gets added to the full release!

Final verdict is that it was definitely worth the wait, with the only disappointment being no online multiplayer (which hopefully comes). The whole concept is every fun and novel, in which all the maps seem to be procedurally generated as you play. One player starts off as the Hero, while the others play as three Ghosts, which have the ability to possess things throughout the rooms... such as pentagrams, for monster summons, and dormant traps, which can be utilized.\n\nThe object for the players is simple: Be the first to get up to XP Level 10 so you can open up the portal to face the final boss and fight for your escape. A Hero earns their experience by killing the opposing players who take monster forms, but there's also a second form of specialized experience, particularly useful to the Ghost players: Vitae. Every time a Ghost player causes damage to the current Hero, they earn this currency, which can be used in a variety of ways, like taking a warp to the floor's shop, pay tribute to an idol for quick cash, or... if you're feeling more offensive... use it to upgrade your monsters. That melee skeleton not cutting it for you? Upgrade it to a bow skeleton for heavier, ranged damage. Being an early access game, I can see there's still plenty more to be made for this game, so I can see this system being expanded on quite nicely. Even better, winning the game makes unlocks more things to use in the game, which helps increase the replay value here.\n\nMy only gripe is the lack of online multiplayer, which could make this game's popularity explode greatly, but even then... If you have four controllers to plug into your PC? Get this... NOW. It's definitely a riot of a local multiplayer party game. :>","August 9, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The human is seeking gold and experience. Once the human grows up to experience level 10, they make go into a special realm and fight a final end-boss. If they win against the boss, they are the dungeon survivor.\n\nThe ghosts, on the other hand fly around grabbing orbs. Once they collect enough orbs they're able to drop simple slime monsters into the map. If ANY monster is in a room, then the doors lock and the human must slay them. In some rooms the ghosts may be able to use Monster Symbols to take control of a larger monster and directly fight against the human. In some rooms, the ghosts can possess traps and trigger them against the human. If a ghost kills the human, they come into the game as the human and the dead player returns as a ghost.\n\nHere and there you'll find a shop where you can upgrade your spells, weapons, or passive abilities.\n\nThe entire purpose of the game is to play as a human long enough to get to level 10, then escape the dungeon by killing the boss.\n\nWhat's really fun, is that you only get 1 chance to fight a boss monster per dungeon floor. If you fail, or are not a high enough level, then you most descend further into the dungeon before you can try again. Between each floor in the dungeon, the players can exchange the power they've gained (granted when the human levels up) to evolve their selections of monsters, to effectively increase the difficulty of the next floor of the dungeon.\n\nThis is definitely a lot of fun.\n\nThe final boss is a large beast that 3-players can take control of simultaneously against the human. If the players are on point, it's VERY HARD.\n\nWith only a few players, this game is very very simple. With 4-players actually trying to do a good job, the game is hectic and REALLY shines.\n\n-- Family --\n\nMy 4-year old is a little unsure of the exact goals. But, she does like possessing items in the maps.  But, she gets tired of the game after 1 run-through.\n\nThe 9-year old has it all figured out and she does a great job.\n\nWe really like playing this game 4-player as a family. The 4-year old gets a BIT distracted sometimes. But, overall she's ok. I definitely had to take her through the game a few times 2-player with the explicit purpose of showing her around before she could understand it.\n\n-- Overall --\n\nI can't wait till they add more boss types and dungeon diversity. This game has fantastic style and I trust these developers to make the right decisions for the game.","August 10, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Notice all the actors are trying to steal the show? Crawl is just like that – with chunky bloody monster bits. And friends.\n\nCrawl encourages us all to be narcissistic actors.

You, along with three of your friends (Or bots, if you so choose or have no one to play with), start right off the bat in the middle of a dungeon. One of you four is the hero, who must battle your three friends to first reach a high enough level to challenge the final boss, who, might I add, is also controlled by your three friends. The three who are not the hero control spectres, who take over dungeon traps strewn about, as well as transform into monsters with the use of bloody pentagrams on the floor of the dungeon. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU CONTROL MONSTERS. How cool is that?! For those of you who are like me, I've always thought that controlling the monsters in games would be completely, and utterly, awesome.\n\nThis game makes all your dreams come true. And with the granting of your wishes, the devs are still updating the game and planning for huge additions. This game will satisfy your hunger for blood, and then some. Something I love about this game is the local co-op. This game was made for you to butt heads against your closest friends, then claw into them. Not with a random guy you get paired with. However, while I really love this concept, I think that it would be a wonderful idea to add the option for us to do that. Especially if you have no friends who are interested in playing with you.\n\nAlso note that this game is Early Access. This is something very important to keep in mind. The devs are still working on this game. And from what they already have available, I would say it is definitely worth getting this game if you are into this type of game.","September 19, 2014","true","28.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All the items are super fun to combine and it's been fun seeing how long I can go with certain monsters without having to evolve them, and things like that.\nSome things I'd think would be awesome if they were added:\n-A Campaign: As fun as it is to grind through with a bot accosting me at every room, I would really enjoy some plot. It would be really cool if I was able to save my level and my items that I have at the time, and continue through the dungeons and such. I would definetly log a lot of hours on this game if such a thing were to exist.\n-Gods: I'd like to kind of have a plethera of gods to choose from, with all their different minions and monsters. I'd also like to see some use of the actual gods themselves-- there are pictures of the gods, but no real reason to know what they look like. They're just a face. It would be really cool if there was a point in the game (of even a gamemode) where you get to play as the god you chose, and get to unleash your special kind of hell on your enemies.\n-Heroes: As it stands now, when playing with four people, one person is pitted against three ghouls who get to try their best to rip their friend a new one. It would be nice to have some 2 v. 2 action, or maybe (when there's three players) two heroes and a ghoul. Just something to change it up and put it more in the players hands.\nIn addition to the Heroes suggestions, maybe you could have different hero types, or characters. Something to vary the gameplay.\nIt would also be pretty cool if people could submit their monster, item, and hero designs to 8bit-ify and have in the game.\nPretty much like workshop.\n\n\nJust some ideas I've had while I've been playing-- I'm sure that half of what I've said are things you guys are already considering or even working into the next update. Either way, I'm excited to see where this game is headed!","August 21, 2014","true","68.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For ten dollars I can't recomend this game enough, although I do have a few complaints. The game can be too short which can make the upgrades from the shop feel worthless if you challenge the boss soon after. Also in order to beat the boss consistantly you only need hyper dash or berzerk when playing against the computer. My second complaint is the lack of game modes.

One of you will be a human fighter while the others are relegated to existing only as insubstantial phantoms. The hero is free to exlplore throughouth the dungeon, delving deeper into its catacombs as necessary to continue on in hopes of treasure, merchants, or a teleporter which can take the hero to the final boss room and either freedom or absolute destruction. As the hero moves from room to room, however, the phantom players can and will do everything they can to kill the hero, from possessing a variety of traps and summoning helper slimes to, most essentially, manifesting in the physical forms of any manner of beast from bear-trap summoning goblins to centaur archers to formidable gazer demons more than capable of slaying would-be-heroes. In the event that any phantom does kill the human opponent, they themselves will procure that player's humanity, spawinging as their own mortal fighter. This is the key pattern of the gameplay, with the hero being rewarded with experiencing points and the chance to purchase rare treasures from merchants nestled within the dungeon catacombs, while the phantoms are rewarded with stronger monsters and blood, which can later be turned into gold should they attain human form. The essential goal is to reach level 10 as the hero and, with the aid of an already impressive variety of unlockable weapons, potions, spells, and other items, reach the teleporter room instanced on each floor of the randomly generated dungeon and face the final boss in combat. The phantoms can possess parts of the boss's body to aid in the assault against the hero in an all-or-nothing battle. With victory, the hero is rewarded with freedom, but, should the hero be slain by his friends in his final assault, his name and likeness will forever be cast into ashes.\n\nThis game is still a work in progress but is still an easy product to recommend because all of the fundamental features and gameplay mechanics are already quite functional, entertaining, and polished. The core gameplay of killing your friends and becoming stronger in doing so is well-polished and, a few Early Access hiccups aside (including a lack of variety as of the time of this review and a forgivable level of question of balance with certain elements) is absolutely addicting in it's fast-paced flow of action, chance, and reward.\n\nThe game is themed well with what could be called a haunted-arcade vibe that keeps the visceral action light and helps the player appreciate the charming and beautifully rendered retro-style graphics. While the look could understandably be considered "played-out" to some extent, in the current indie environment, but the atmosphere cast over the room by the up-tempo horror-midi soundtrack is both appropriate and exceptional.\n\nWith flawless controller support, easy-to-grasp yet hard-to-master brutal combat, quick 20-60 minute gameplay sessions and great mood I would absolutely recommend "Crawl" to any gamer who lives with other gamers or plays often with others in the same room. "Crawl" has no online support whatsoever and, while the bots are functional and helpful if you have less than 4 people, playing alone feels like more of an empty practice session at best. This game is just a blast with friends that you can easily show someone whose never played before a controller and play well into the night without becoming bored, and that's only with the content available as of this very early access build. For 9.99 I personally think that a better value is difficult to find, even here on Steam.","August 16, 2014","true","36.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/girthspirit/recommended/293780/","girthspirit","Jesus Was My Dad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/girthspirit/","49 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is probably one of the most fun games I've ever played. Being a fan of both roguelike adventure games and oldschool 8 bit action and never being able to get my fill of either, this game stopped up the hole in my soul. Competitve game fan? This is totally for you. Friendships have almost been ruined. I've made my girlfriend's little brother rage quit several times  (claims Berserk is op, wants you to remove it. plz dont.) The huge amount of unlockables keeps me coming back for more. The variety in weapon animations, awesome/funny monsters (huge fan of the "flash my tentacles from under my robes" mind flayers :D) and interesting spell/item mechanics to keep everything spicy in the dungeon.\n\nI know this is the earliest version of early release, but I have a few polish suggestions for you guys.\n\nIf you could add twin-stick movement support for game pads that would be awesome. As it is now there are specific advantages that mice have over keyboard/gamepad, and vice versa, namely a full 360 degree aim for  mouse players and  ease of movement for kb/gp. I suppose for some people without game pads it wouldn't be as fair, but I would just as well go out and buy two more so everyone at my pad can enjoy perfect aim and movement.\n\nAnother thing, somewhat building off of the last suggestion is within the Kourok boss fight. Along the bottom of the screen to the left is a blind spot where, unless a mouse player is taking control of the eye beam, you cannot hit the challenger whatsoever. Perhaps you could add a scrolling left/right adjustment crosshair instead of the five direction spread for the eye beam? That way every section of the screen can be blasted with the beam.\n\nBesides that as of now, I don't have any complaints. I don't think balance is an issue seeing shops/levels/monster spawns are all random, and everyone has access to the same types of spells/items/weapons/monsters. It's a perfect balance of luck/skill that allows a player to excel if they perform well, but can still be thwarted with a bit of teamwork and quick thinking from the ghosts.\n\nI can't wait to see how you guys expand on the dungeon aesthetics, more colors/props/texture and whatnot. If I could give any suggestions/requests on this, I think it would be interesting to see the dungeon floors randomized like the Infinite Layers of the Abyss from Dungeons and Dragons Grayhawk cosmology. Instead of having the floor's identities set in stone, just have the decor and name reflect each other and randomly generated (ie, acid themed floor "The Acrid Hive" or flesh walls/floors "Hall of Goosebumps.") Another roguelike game that has this element somewhat is a bullet hell  called Shoot First. Music reflecting the decor would be awesome too.\n\nAnd one last request.. please implement a monster that's like the Devil from Heroes of Might and Magic 3 http://www.heroesofmightandmagic.com/heroes3/h3px/archdevil.gif\n\nThey are able to enter a burst of flame and teleport across the battle grid... maybe area damage when enter/exit the flames? The scythe would be awesome flavor too.\n\nThanks for reading!~","August 16, 2014","true","106.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Looking forward to the additions they plan to make: more bosses, more monsters, more evolutions, more weapons (!) and more tilesets. A ton of fun even solo against bots; if you have your PC hooked up to your TV - and can swing the amount of controllers required - this looks like an amazing party game, moreso than even maybe Guardian Heroes for the Saturn.\n\nI hate to admit it, but perhaps it would be easier if Crawl found a home on the PS4 or XBone. It almost seems like it was natively designed for those systems (i.e. local multiplayer setup). The fast-paced competitive nature of the game reminds me of Power Stone 2 where the sole goal is to become MORE AWESOME than your peers. There is a certain 'equilibrium' to the leveling scheme that I very much enjoy and everyone can be involved & have fun whether they are the protagonist, monsters, traps, or just marionetting the boss.\n\nThe pixel art-style does an amazing job of illustrating the action on-screen and also suggests careful choices of form and color. The level design of the dungeons (as mentioned before, they are planning more) feels like a fun slog through a Hero Quest scenario only not in boardgame iteration. Do I recommend getting it as it exists currently? Yes. Will it be better after it has time to ferment? Double yes.","August 17, 2014","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It can be played up to four players, one person being the hero, and the other three being ghosts. The ghosts try to kill the hero by taking over objects or using a demon circle to summon a monster to fight the hero with. If one of the ghosts kill the hero, the ghost that got the killing blow will become the new hero. At the end of every floor the ghosts will get points every time a hero leveled up, and they get to use the points to evolve their monsters. While you're the hero; you try to get to level 10 so you can open a portal to the final boss. If you kill the boss (Which the ghosts will control) you win. If not, you'll be kicked out of the portal and have a small amount of health left. If the boss isn't beaten after three tries its game over and the ghosts win.

It is a local coop dungeon crawler intended for 2 to 4 players and meant to be played with controllers.

Otherwise your experience may vary, because (I didn't try, it's just a presumption) it won't be very fun to play with AI and there's no online coop, so you have to gather up at someone's home.

We had 4 players, 2 with xbox controller, 1 with the xbox controller from the guitar hero drumkit and one (who despises controllers) on the keyboard. First they made the mandatory jokes about the pixely graphics and how it made their eyes bleed, but in the end the gameplay really made up for it.\n\nSo, in this rogue-like game you are an adventurer trying to survive a maze of rooms and monsters (your friends) on a quest to defeat Kurok, the final boss. So while you are making your way through the rooms, your friends control incorporeal ghosts that can spawn monsters and possess traps. In some rooms pentagrams appear that allow a ghost to materialize into one of his monsters (randomly chosen) and try to gain back his mortality by defeating the hero. The one who delivers the final blow gets to play the hero.\n\nOverall, everyone got to play the hero for a while.. except me. But that's actually not a bad thing! Once you reach the trapdoor of a floor you get to the next stage and before starting, every player can upgrade his monsters. You get upgrade points (or "vitae") based on how many levels the other players gained, which means that if you didn't get to play the hero, you should get a lot of vitae to make your monsters a lot stronger. I really like this mechanic, but it didn't work out that well for us, since my friends still had pretty strong monsters as well (until I got the dragon, muahahah).\n\nWith 4 players the game is pretty intense and we had a great laugh. I really recommend playing this game couch-coop.","September 28, 2014","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Final verdict is that it was definitely worth the wait, with the only disappointment being no online multiplayer (which hopefully comes). The whole concept is every fun and novel, in which all the maps seem to be procedurally generated as you play. One player starts off as the Hero, while the others play as three Ghosts, which have the ability to possess things throughout the rooms... such as pentagrams, for monster summons, and dormant traps, which can be utilized.\n\nThe object for the players is simple: Be the first to get up to XP Level 10 so you can open up the portal to face the final boss and fight for your escape. A Hero earns their experience by killing the opposing players who take monster forms, but there's also a second form of specialized experience, particularly useful to the Ghost players: Vitae. Every time a Ghost player causes damage to the current Hero, they earn this currency, which can be used in a variety of ways, like taking a warp to the floor's shop, pay tribute to an idol for quick cash, or... if you're feeling more offensive... use it to upgrade your monsters. That melee skeleton not cutting it for you? Upgrade it to a bow skeleton for heavier, ranged damage. Being an early access game, I can see there's still plenty more to be made for this game, so I can see this system being expanded on quite nicely. Even better, winning the game makes unlocks more things to use in the game, which helps increase the replay value here.\n\nMy only gripe is the lack of online multiplayer, which could make this game's popularity explode greatly, but even then... If you have four controllers to plug into your PC? Get this... NOW. It's definitely a riot of a local multiplayer party game. :>","August 9, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It would be interesting to know if this game would have been more lucrative as an arcade hit or a Steam game because it really puts together some great elements for multiplayer action.

The human is seeking gold and experience. Once the human grows up to experience level 10, they make go into a special realm and fight a final end-boss. If they win against the boss, they are the dungeon survivor.\n\nThe ghosts, on the other hand fly around grabbing orbs. Once they collect enough orbs they're able to drop simple slime monsters into the map. If ANY monster is in a room, then the doors lock and the human must slay them. In some rooms the ghosts may be able to use Monster Symbols to take control of a larger monster and directly fight against the human. In some rooms, the ghosts can possess traps and trigger them against the human. If a ghost kills the human, they come into the game as the human and the dead player returns as a ghost.\n\nHere and there you'll find a shop where you can upgrade your spells, weapons, or passive abilities.\n\nThe entire purpose of the game is to play as a human long enough to get to level 10, then escape the dungeon by killing the boss.\n\nWhat's really fun, is that you only get 1 chance to fight a boss monster per dungeon floor. If you fail, or are not a high enough level, then you most descend further into the dungeon before you can try again. Between each floor in the dungeon, the players can exchange the power they've gained (granted when the human levels up) to evolve their selections of monsters, to effectively increase the difficulty of the next floor of the dungeon.\n\nThis is definitely a lot of fun.\n\nThe final boss is a large beast that 3-players can take control of simultaneously against the human. If the players are on point, it's VERY HARD.\n\nWith only a few players, this game is very very simple. With 4-players actually trying to do a good job, the game is hectic and REALLY shines.\n\n-- Family --\n\nMy 4-year old is a little unsure of the exact goals. But, she does like possessing items in the maps.  But, she gets tired of the game after 1 run-through.\n\nThe 9-year old has it all figured out and she does a great job.\n\nWe really like playing this game 4-player as a family. The 4-year old gets a BIT distracted sometimes. But, overall she's ok. I definitely had to take her through the game a few times 2-player with the explicit purpose of showing her around before she could understand it.\n\n-- Overall --\n\nI can't wait till they add more boss types and dungeon diversity. This game has fantastic style and I trust these developers to make the right decisions for the game.","August 10, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You, along with three of your friends (Or bots, if you so choose or have no one to play with), start right off the bat in the middle of a dungeon. One of you four is the hero, who must battle your three friends to first reach a high enough level to challenge the final boss, who, might I add, is also controlled by your three friends. The three who are not the hero control spectres, who take over dungeon traps strewn about, as well as transform into monsters with the use of bloody pentagrams on the floor of the dungeon. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU CONTROL MONSTERS. How cool is that?! For those of you who are like me, I've always thought that controlling the monsters in games would be completely, and utterly, awesome.\n\nThis game makes all your dreams come true. And with the granting of your wishes, the devs are still updating the game and planning for huge additions. This game will satisfy your hunger for blood, and then some. Something I love about this game is the local co-op. This game was made for you to butt heads against your closest friends, then claw into them. Not with a random guy you get paired with. However, while I really love this concept, I think that it would be a wonderful idea to add the option for us to do that. Especially if you have no friends who are interested in playing with you.\n\nAlso note that this game is Early Access. This is something very important to keep in mind. The devs are still working on this game. And from what they already have available, I would say it is definitely worth getting this game if you are into this type of game.","September 19, 2014","true","28.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very, very fun.  Any criticism I have is in no way a deal-breaker.\nPros:\n- Balance: Lots of attention seems to be paid to keeping it interesting w/ the power dynamic between players constantly shifting.  Getting your minions' butts kicked? You'll rank up monsters faster. Spent a bunch of time running around as the hero killing everyone else? Now you're reincarnated as an toothpick spitting inchworm. All this is done without feeling like it's simply picking on the person in the lead.\nADDITIONALLY, the end-game is satisfying regardless of outcome since everyone both worked for and against it the entire time.\n- Pace: I'm impressed how well it allows for a leveling and item system while still keeping the gogoGOGOGO!GO!GO! mentality.  There always seems to be something for everyone to be doing.\n- Mood & Atmosphere: The glitched out voice acting brings me right back to scratchy copies of Golden Axe played on poorly tracking TVs.  Pixel graphics can be an aquired taste, but I think it fits well and this game puts a cool spin on it (this kind of "possessed game cartridge").\n\nCons (somewhat minor, but I hope can be addressed as the game develops )\n- Player confusion: With the unsaturated color palette it can be easy to lose track of your player.  This gets harder during big brawls when some people may be controlling the same type of minion.  Regardless, the learning curve is small.\n- Advancement & Unlocks: As it stands, the item and "God" unlocks after a session seem arbitrary.  Currently, they seem to be coming out of the glitched-out ether of the game (which is cool mood-wise), but it might be nice to see as least know what's triggering them - Are they indeed random? Tied to playtime? In-game exploration?\n\nI've only played this a few hours but it is already well worth the price - for the single player experience, let alone the strong party game this is!","January 16, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're losing half the experience.\n- Nothing is as menacing as a fat fish shimmying towards you.\n- Remember to chant "Spoooooooky" whenever you're in ghost form. No, it doesn't get old, ever, and don't let the others tell you otherwise.\n- Amass ghost blobs and deploy jelly monsters to assert your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ status. Best practice includes:\n** Deploy blob before the player wishes to leave the room or travel down stairs.\n** Whenever the human player enters the boss chamber, deploy every jelly. Watch them swarm him while the cut-scene plays.\n- Don't underestimate the small floppy fish and its pew-pew stick projectile. It is the Magicarp of this game. By god, you don't want to die from Splash.\n- Most monsters let you leave trails of colored fluids.

The graphics really aren't too bad, and besides, I vastly prefer well-made 2D graphics to fuzzy, badly made 3D graphics any day. Very fun gameplay, and I like the fact that you can, for once play as the traps as well as the monsters.\n\nMy only real problem with this game is the aiming, and the fact whatever you are shooting goes whichever way you are facing. This makes ranged monsters/heroes feel uncontrollable at times. I would like to see some more content, such as new monsters and equipment, as well as maybe a couple of new traps. I also think the Gatekeeper is a bit easy, and could perhaps have some more health.\n\nApart from that this game is AWESOME! I highly recommend it to anyone who likes dungeon crawl games, as well as Dungeons and Dragons players. By which I mean, of course, PROPER D&D, the Pen and Paper games, not that stupid Neverwinter game made by Perfect World. That game sucks.\n\nAnyway, DEFINITELY a reccomendation. They are still bringing out more content for about another year, and after that the price is going up, probably to this games actual worth, about $20.

The concept, gameplay and art style were all so fresh and unique that I was immediately hooked by this game. There are too few games in the world today that evoke the same emotions as the quest involved in playing a round of Crawl with your friends.\nFirstly, as an early access game, I was astonished when I picked this up because I found little to no glitches or bugs and it was bursting with content right from the start. The community is also very much alive and the developers are simply phenomenal, always keeping you updated as to their progress and ideas for the game.\nThe gameplay is like nothing I've ever played with up to 4 players playing locally (3 as ghosts and one as a hero) attempting to become a level 10 hero and defeat the dungeons boss. The catch is that since there is only one hero at a time, if you are not playing as the hero, you are one of the 3 ghosts controlling the dungeons minions, traps and bosses attempting to kill the hero and whomever deals the killing blow becomes the next hero.\nGames are generally fast-paced and frenetic yet the overall game round can take up to 30-40 minutes to play through depending on the players experience levels. The fact that the game is truly semi-cooperative in nature at all times is wonderful and keeps player interaction high. This is what makes local multiplayer gaming so wonderful to me and Crawl really delivers on that front. Many gamers have argued that they wished this game offered online support, and while I understand that not everybody has the opportunity to play with 4 players locally I really don't think this game would deliver the same experience if it were being played with people miles away on the internet instead  of your friends and family on the couch next to you.\nWhile I absolutely love this game and how unique and just plain fun it is the one major frustration for me would have to be the fact that the monster who deals the killing blow becomes the next hero and not the monster who dealt the most damage or some other qualifier. This just seems unintuitive, unfair and unrewarding to the non-hero players and I really think this should at least be an alternative option for the game settings if not the standard. I have discussed this with other gamers and while I understand their points as to how making it the player who deals the last blow can work as a balancing mechanism for weaker players I've seen it create just as much imbalance and more importantly change the flow of play to where camping is encouraged for monsters so that they can prepare themselves to deal the killing blow instead of simply attack the hero relentlessly. I truly believe that there should at least be an alternative option available in the settings for the monster who dealt the most damage to become the hero because I find it silly for a game to inherently make one of its mechanics just frustrating for the players  and immediately turn them off the excitement.\nDespite my one major criticism I have seldom found a game whose development has excited me as much as this one and I really hope that the developers consider my opinions on the game. Overall Crawl is definitely a game worth checking out for any gamer who wants to experience a new and exciting type of game and I highly recommend it if like me you are a huge fan of local multiplayer games that appeal to that childhood sense of playing arcade games and other video games side to side with your friends and family before the lonely Online Gaming era.\n","October 27, 2014","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It can be played up to four players, one person being the hero, and the other three being ghosts. The ghosts try to kill the hero by taking over objects or using a demon circle to summon a monster to fight the hero with. If one of the ghosts kill the hero, the ghost that got the killing blow will become the new hero. At the end of every floor the ghosts will get points every time a hero leveled up, and they get to use the points to evolve their monsters. While you're the hero; you try to get to level 10 so you can open a portal to the final boss. If you kill the boss (Which the ghosts will control) you win. If not, you'll be kicked out of the portal and have a small amount of health left. If the boss isn't beaten after three tries its game over and the ghosts win.

The concept, gameplay and art style were all so fresh and unique that I was immediately hooked by this game. There are too few games in the world today that evoke the same emotions as the quest involved in playing a round of Crawl with your friends.\nFirstly, as an early access game, I was astonished when I picked this up because I found little to no glitches or bugs and it was bursting with content right from the start. The community is also very much alive and the developers are simply phenomenal, always keeping you updated as to their progress and ideas for the game.\nThe gameplay is like nothing I've ever played with up to 4 players playing locally (3 as ghosts and one as a hero) attempting to become a level 10 hero and defeat the dungeons boss. The catch is that since there is only one hero at a time, if you are not playing as the hero, you are one of the 3 ghosts controlling the dungeons minions, traps and bosses attempting to kill the hero and whomever deals the killing blow becomes the next hero.\nGames are generally fast-paced and frenetic yet the overall game round can take up to 30-40 minutes to play through depending on the players experience levels. The fact that the game is truly semi-cooperative in nature at all times is wonderful and keeps player interaction high. This is what makes local multiplayer gaming so wonderful to me and Crawl really delivers on that front. Many gamers have argued that they wished this game offered online support, and while I understand that not everybody has the opportunity to play with 4 players locally I really don't think this game would deliver the same experience if it were being played with people miles away on the internet instead  of your friends and family on the couch next to you.\nWhile I absolutely love this game and how unique and just plain fun it is the one major frustration for me would have to be the fact that the monster who deals the killing blow becomes the next hero and not the monster who dealt the most damage or some other qualifier. This just seems unintuitive, unfair and unrewarding to the non-hero players and I really think this should at least be an alternative option for the game settings if not the standard. I have discussed this with other gamers and while I understand their points as to how making it the player who deals the last blow can work as a balancing mechanism for weaker players I've seen it create just as much imbalance and more importantly change the flow of play to where camping is encouraged for monsters so that they can prepare themselves to deal the killing blow instead of simply attack the hero relentlessly. I truly believe that there should at least be an alternative option available in the settings for the monster who dealt the most damage to become the hero because I find it silly for a game to inherently make one of its mechanics just frustrating for the players  and immediately turn them off the excitement.\nDespite my one major criticism I have seldom found a game whose development has excited me as much as this one and I really hope that the developers consider my opinions on the game. Overall Crawl is definitely a game worth checking out for any gamer who wants to experience a new and exciting type of game and I highly recommend it if like me you are a huge fan of local multiplayer games that appeal to that childhood sense of playing arcade games and other video games side to side with your friends and family before the lonely Online Gaming era.\n","October 27, 2014","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun to play with your pals in front of one screen and on one couch to enjoy the game.\n\nOne of the most notable features of Crawl is its extreme replay value. Everybody loves getting rewarded even if they lost, so the game will always intensify after every time you play, which adds more possibilities for a character! The 0.3 update was very useful, because it doesn't take long to unlock everything in v0.2 and especially v0.1. v0.3 added some dieties, evolutions and even an alternate boss that can be very useful and effective. But that's what's best about this game: the frequent updates! But, one of the most well-known features is the awesome animations and the retro feel. The animatons are indescribable. They are the smoothest out of every single pixel-graphic game I've ever seen.\n\nThus, I rate this game an 11/10. That's right. 11/10.

Well worth the $9.99.\n\nPros:\n-Each time through is different\n-Good variety of weapons, monsters, traps, and spells\n-Great fun with a group of friends\n-Unlocking new items and features after every session makes it hard not to start up another session just to see what the new stuff does\n-Plays quick (about 30 - 60 minutes) for a session\n-Very polished already and very few minor bugs\n\nCons:\n-No online support yet: I can't play it with friends who don't live near by : (\n-Music variety: Good music but there is only a few tracks\n-Scenery variety: The rooms always uses the same brown brick and tile, a variety of different backgrounds would be nice.\n\nMixed Bag:\n-Your aim is always in the same direction as your movement. This keeps the game controls from becoming overly complex, but it prevent you from back-peddling while firing a projectile attack.\n-Fights can become super chaotic, and it becomes very easy to lose track of your character.  Sometimes this adds to the fun and other times it can be a little frustrating.\n","January 17, 2015","true","26.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No idea why,I desinstalled and reinstalled it about 20 times before but for some reason,my controllers get properly recognised now (maybe a patch was released,I don't know)\n\nSo the review then:\n\n- This game is really fun.It's a bit difficult to understand and to explain (especially when playing with non english speakers) but the learning curve isn't too steep.\n-The mechanics are really engaging and you won't find yourself watching your friends have fun,some times you'll prefer playing as a monster because who doesn't want to be able to be a dragon,a lovecraftian-cthulhu-mind flayer,or a giant skeleton knight ?\n-I just started but it seems like there is a LOT to unlock in this game.Combos with skills/trinkets are pretty cool though sometimes imbalanced (raging bull + haunted axe x 3 = GG GL HF)  but it's a party game,not a competitive game.\n-The versus doesn't just inculde monsters vs human.You'll often try to steal a kill to regain your humanity,but when the human player has to fight a boss,you'll cooperate to make sure he doesn't win.\n\nI didn't quite understand how you reach the final struggle(game ends after that,which caught us off guard as we thought we could re-try the final boss several times) but hopefully I'll find an answer in the forums.It's definitely a multiplayer game though,so I wouldn't recommend buying it if you don't have anyone willing to play with you,the bots are fairly easy to beat.","October 27, 2015","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

Up to four players can play at a time. 1-3 play as the spirits inhabiting the dungeon, and they attempt to destroy the Hero who is trying to conquer the dungeon by controlling traps and summoning monsters. The more blood from the Hero that each spirit spills, the more they can offer to the gods in exchange for gold. Once the Hero is defeated, the spirit who delivered the killing blow now takes his place. The new Hero can take all the blood spilled from the old hero as an offering and receive gold which can buy new items like weapons, spell tomes, potions, armor, and charms. This essentially leads to a race for level 10 as the Hero. However, at the end of each floor, for each level the Hero has risen, the spirits are given points to level their monsters. Whom ever can level their hero form to 10 can open the portal to the final boss, Kurok. Kurok can be controlled by all three spirit players simultaneously, and will provide and extreme challenge to the Hero with weapons like toxic sludge, trap bubbles, and a humongous eye laser. Each run of the game, no matter who attempts to defeat Kurok, there can only be three attempts to defeat Kurok before he unleashes his wrath upon the world. If all three attempts fail, Kurok will break lose, and all players lose. The lowest scoring player of the game has their in-game profile permanently erased.\n\nWhilst I still have not unlocked every God in the game, this has become my favorite party game ever. When you find yourself smiling at the person who is playing Hero, saying to them "I'm definitely going to kill you", it creates a special moment. This game has created the most friendly gamer rivalry I have ever experienced. The localized experience that the players get is absolutely incredible. It does not take long to understand how the game works. Then, after about 8 hours of  play, the participants can still find themselves discovering new items popping up in the blacksmith shop.\n\nI still find this game incredible, and I've recommended it to many friends. We all agree, it creates the best and most friendly kind of game rivalry we have ever experienced.","December 20, 2014","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything currently in the game is extremely tight, polished, well-balanced and incredibly fun. I only have a few gripes.\n\nPlay if you're looking for:\nLocal MP with some beers and some buds.\nPolished dungeon crawling with excellent controls.\nCompetition.\nMonster evolution.\nA game where you get to be the bad guys/bosses.\n\nDon't play if you:\nHave no local friends to play with.\nDon't have a controller.\nDon't like pixel games.\n\nAs I have said, everything in the game is amazing. The only problem I have is what's NOT in the game. For this to really hit just the right spot, it really only needs more content. The developers are releasing updates every several weeks, however, so this shouldn't be a problem for long. I would personally like to see more than one boss, as there is only a single one right now.\n\nIn time, I would also like to see the life of the game sessions expanded a bit. I'm certain it's a lot more fun with a full party, but if your game consists of only two players it is over quite quickly. The monster evolution trees can be fairly short and the requirement to unlock the boss is easy to attain. I would like to see an option wherein you can increase the level required to access the boss.\n\nThe mouse and keyboard controls are also terrible independently. You can either pick the keyboard or the mouse, but not both. An option to combine these two would solve the problem (WASD to move, mouse to attack).","December 9, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No idea why,I desinstalled and reinstalled it about 20 times before but for some reason,my controllers get properly recognised now (maybe a patch was released,I don't know)\n\nSo the review then:\n\n- This game is really fun.It's a bit difficult to understand and to explain (especially when playing with non english speakers) but the learning curve isn't too steep.\n-The mechanics are really engaging and you won't find yourself watching your friends have fun,some times you'll prefer playing as a monster because who doesn't want to be able to be a dragon,a lovecraftian-cthulhu-mind flayer,or a giant skeleton knight ?\n-I just started but it seems like there is a LOT to unlock in this game.Combos with skills/trinkets are pretty cool though sometimes imbalanced (raging bull + haunted axe x 3 = GG GL HF)  but it's a party game,not a competitive game.\n-The versus doesn't just inculde monsters vs human.You'll often try to steal a kill to regain your humanity,but when the human player has to fight a boss,you'll cooperate to make sure he doesn't win.\n\nI didn't quite understand how you reach the final struggle(game ends after that,which caught us off guard as we thought we could re-try the final boss several times) but hopefully I'll find an answer in the forums.It's definitely a multiplayer game though,so I wouldn't recommend buying it if you don't have anyone willing to play with you,the bots are fairly easy to beat.","October 27, 2015","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

The game is updated every few months providing plenty of time to test out the new additions and get used to the tweaks. The devs are active in the steam forums and are VERY open to discussion and reccomendations.\n\ngameplay:\none player (chosen at random) controls the hero at the start, the other players are ghosts that control the monsters and traps.\ndungeons are randomly generated and each room has a minimum pentagram(monster spawn point) equal to the number of players controlling ghosts.\neach player has 3 monsters based on the god you choose to worship.\ngod can also provide a bonus to your hero character.\nevolve monsters by damaging or effecting the hero.\nbranching monster evolution tree.

Crawl is a insanely entertaining game with loads of things to explain. So I'll jump right into it. Crawl is a really fun game especailly when playing with freinds, and even if you are forever alone. Its still pretty fun ( But not for long. ) Anyway I am getting way off track here. In Crawl you either play as the human, who travels through a massive dungeon collecting gold and XP and buying tons of new weapons and sub-weapons which brings you to the final show down. With either a three-headed dragon or some weird chubby alein thing. However playing the human wont be easy because your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ freinds. ( Or CPU's. ) will be playing as ghosts trying to beat every last clump of living poo out of you. As a ghost you can posses traps to make them attack the human, which is supprisingly effective. Or you can go the more aggresive and entertaining way. Turning into a monster. Playing as the bad guy never felt so good but you wont be laughing for long, because if you are the one to deliver the finishing blow to the puny mortal. You basicly switch spots with the person you killed, so now they get to have ajolly old time chasing you around. Putting twice as much stress on you, however if you the human become level 10 and defeat the final boss. Then you unlock new stuff and earn bragging rights. So yeah... I would recomend it!","September 25, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is superb, though a bit tricky to get used to at first. (But hey, they're doing something new, so it will take a little bit of getting used to).\n\nThe ability of the player mobs to spawn on pentagrams is well thought out, but they also have the ability to take control of traps to further inhibit the Dungeoneer. This can become a bit of a cluster♥♥♥♥ if you have 3 enemy players, as some of the rooms are very small in regards to the amount of anti-hero objects in them.\n\nThe leveling up features seem pretty smooth, as well as the Wrath mechanics, and the shop. The Boss pentagram that appears on each level (accessible at lvl 10) sends you to a room where you battle one of many huge bosses. This can feel a bit like an attack-spam sometimes, but only if you are significantly prepared for the boss through the purchase of upgrades. It does still feel like a retro boss battle.\n\nOverall I would give Crawl an 8/10\n\nThey are bringing something new and interesting to the table in the form of something familiar. It is a great game to play  alone, or with friends, and it's a great excuse to cuss your friends out when they booby trap kill you before the final room.","January 1","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is superb, though a bit tricky to get used to at first. (But hey, they're doing something new, so it will take a little bit of getting used to).\n\nThe ability of the player mobs to spawn on pentagrams is well thought out, but they also have the ability to take control of traps to further inhibit the Dungeoneer. This can become a bit of a cluster♥♥♥♥ if you have 3 enemy players, as some of the rooms are very small in regards to the amount of anti-hero objects in them.\n\nThe leveling up features seem pretty smooth, as well as the Wrath mechanics, and the shop. The Boss pentagram that appears on each level (accessible at lvl 10) sends you to a room where you battle one of many huge bosses. This can feel a bit like an attack-spam sometimes, but only if you are significantly prepared for the boss through the purchase of upgrades. It does still feel like a retro boss battle.\n\nOverall I would give Crawl an 8/10\n\nThey are bringing something new and interesting to the table in the form of something familiar. It is a great game to play  alone, or with friends, and it's a great excuse to cuss your friends out when they booby trap kill you before the final room.","January 1","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everybody gets torn apart in this game. A lot.\n\nOh, you might be wondering, what stops the player in the human flesh bag from just dawdling around and wasting everybody's time? You can do that but when the ghost players aren't otherwise occupied, they're always zooming back and forth gathering up ambient ectoplasm blobs which they can spend to summon slimes. Slimes are pretty pathetic but you can summon them in numbers as a distraction in larger fights and the hero doesn't get rewarded for killing them. Best of all slimes lock the doors when you summon them, which is good fun when the hero is just about to rush out of a trap room.\n\nI was surprised though, I was worried being a ghost would feel like wasted time but honestly not only is it fun to be a ghost but you still feel like you're in the running and pushing to win, and as a session progresses humanity starts flipping back and forth between people with hilarious frequency\n\nIdk I'll write a real review later maybe, basically it's good and you should get it. It's wonderfully competitive enough that even when playing against bots you forget that you're playing against bots","February 29","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although it does need a bit more work.  Which they are doing... They just fixed the bots never miss projectile aiming and increased their ability to deal with cheese.  Best played with other humans though, a.i. just won't ever be on our level of mind games and co-op.\n\nBalance is fairly decent, I would say the better player is almost always going to win...  However any slack in balance is evened out a lot by the always changing 'alliances'.  Kingmaking isn't really an issue the majority of the time, because everyone feels like they have a chance at winning after a game or two.  Plenty of 'fair' handicapped choices for experienced players to choose against greenhorns as well.\n\nDefinitely falls into one of my top 10 games.","January 9","true","35.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
