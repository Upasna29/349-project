"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EligibleHusbando/recommended/367340/","EligibleHusbando","Eligible Husbando #1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EligibleHusbando/","132 products in account","Fleetcomm in its current state consists of only 8 "tutorial" missions designed to get you acquainted with the game's controls. The actual game chapters are going to be released at a later date (hopefully for free), with the first scheduled for May 30, if it isn't delayed.\n\nKEEP IN MIND THAT YOU ARE PAYING FOR TUTORIAL MISSIONS WITH NO GUARANTEE OF RECEIVING A FULL GAME.\n\nSo what's it like? It's a slightly more "tactical" variation on games like geometry wars and asteroids. It has a fairly typical loadout of shmup-like weapons, a shield, a weak laser with infinite ammo, a stronger "railgun" with limited ammo, a temporary cloaking mode and a bomb (which doesn't seem to actually do anything). The gameplay mostly consists of trying to fulfill simple mission objectives such as "destroy all of X". You'll be given a small ship to navigate around a 2D plane (think asteroids but with freedom of movement) and you'll have to dodge/reflect numerous projectiles and enemy ships, while trying to shoot down as many enemies as you can.\n\nSounds great in theory, so how does it play? Kind of like a steaming pile of garbage. The controls are really awkward. You use the mouse to steer the ship but the mouse buttons aren't utilized at all, requiring you to engage in some pretty awkward fingerwork on the keyboard.  Enemy design consists mostly of amorphous blob like enemies, which gives you the impression that you're fighting amoebas rather than a menacing alien fleet. The game is certainly colorful and your screen will often be filled with flashing green lights and various bright artifacts but you're more likely to get a migraine than enjoyment out of it.\n\nTo be fair, the game is definitely playable and there's a kind of logic to the gameplay, but it's just not fun. Even the original Asteroids feels like a much smoother and more intuitive experience.  I'd also go as far as to say that Asteroid's 4 bit sound effects were a lot better than Fleetcomm's bizarre mixture of hums, drones and blips that make the shooting feel very unsatisfying. Some of the weapons, including your primary gun, don't even make a sound and it's hard to hear the very quiet buzz of exploding enemy units over the deafening dubstep soundtrack. There's just no weight to it at all and you just don't get that feeling of "mass destruction" that you should get from playing a shmup.\n\nAs for the deafening dubstep soundtrack? It's as I described. Repetive, distracting, unpleasant, and it consists of one single track that plays over and over again. Just terrible!\n\nI would rate my 30 minutes in Fleetcomm lower than coming down from an ecstasy binge in a really bad nightclub. Really not a very good experience, and nowhere close to a "complete" one. This is essentially an early access game without the early access label, and a bad one at that. Don't spend your money on this rubbish.\n\nAnd the worst part of it all? It's the result of 4 years of "work" and over $37,000 in public donations. What an absolute joke.\n\nEDIT: ONCE THE PRICE OF THIS GAME INEVITABLY DROPS TO A DOLLAR, IT MIGHT BE WORTH BUYING AS A KUSOGE OR A GAG GIFT, BUT ONLY IF YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE GIVING THE DEVELOPER YOUR POCKET CHANGE.","May 24","false","0.5"," 158 of 169 people (93%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","93","158","169","14","6"

The music sounds like you gave a toddler a laptop and said "make wubwub" and the result makes me want to struck deaf so I shall never hear again. This game is full of bugs, a great example is the lack of a firing sound for the gun in the game. Keep in mind, this game took 4 ♥♥♥♥ing years to develop, theres no excuse for such ♥♥♥♥♥♥ry. The game was about feqw dollars at its discounted price, but honestly I feel owed money for taking up 305 MB of HD space for this digital ♥♥♥♥.

There's a game somewhere in here that's playable that I look forward to seeing in the coming months. Squadrons and formations appear to be fully customizable, which may prove to be interesting if the program can handle it.\n\nCONS: Poorly optimized, it cannot decide if it wants to play at 10fps or 80fps and eats through CPU. No resolution options. Nearly no environmental feedback whatsoever. Program can't execute a proper close without crashing. Interface feels like a clumsy interactive Flash circa 2006, making preview videos misleading, at best. Spammed input can freeze the game up; Not an great asset for a shmup. The tutorial area is a confusing mess-- It introduces concepts slowly, but with absolutely no explanation. Whether you succeed or fail, each mission boots you back to the title screen. Slow, floaty gameplay does not fit the camera-shaking, no-holds-barred style it portrays itself as and is very slow. Balance issues are present in Chapter 0, where you can die within a couple seconds of starting a level, or not take damage for 15 minutes before knowing how to even properly pilot the ship. (If the ship loads. Sometimes it does not, and you are piloting just the directional circle around it.)\n\nWORTH: It may be worth testing out, but I'd question keeping it even at this massively discounted price. This game had been delayed well over five times with a complete disregard towards dates set, so updates for future missions feel extremely bleak. Whether or not this is true, we will find out on May 30th. But as a consumer, it would be foolish to not have major trust issues with such promises being treated so flippantly before. Hopefully the dates set from here on-out will be abided by.\n\nOVERALL: I would like to return on May 30th to see what Chapter 1 has to offer, and alter my review to reflect the changes made. I am a big fan of this genre of games and have anticipated this title for a long while.\n\nSCORE:2/10","May 24","false","6.7"," 87 of 95 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","87","95","2","4"

Let that sink in. Even ignoring the drama of the developer, that alone is worth a downvote. Add in that the music and sound effects were done by Slade's cat clawing its way away from him while he did things illegal in most states and even a shill wouldn't +1 this. Oh and apparently this is just a tech demo, it's not even the full ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed game!\n\nThen consider that this developer actually thinks he can act like he represents the anti censorship group #GamerGate while aggressively censoring his own damn community so much so he delayed release about 4 or 5 separate times because he does not even Striesand and didn't realize the more he censored people that called him out on his BS the more word of his corruption would spread. It's certainly why I'm here. If it were merely a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game I'd have ignored it and let it fade away on its own. Corrupt, censoring, suicidal indie dev? Nope. Get Executed with Impunity. As someone who actually believes in what #GamerGate is about, and developed a deep hatred for this sort of corruption well before I knew #GamerGate existed I'm gonna come in, have some lulz at the dev's expense, and continue on my way.\n\nHere's some highlights of stuff that was censored that's far more entertaining than this "game":\nSlade was called out on "Stolen Valor" - where he claims he recieved military honors he didn't.\nSlade disrespected the military in general by admitting he hid like a coward while calling the people that actually fought stupid.\nPeople asked where's the game? Slade got TrigglyPuffed and perma censored.\nSlade's probably spent more time worrying about some guy who likes Splatoon characters than actually working on this "game".\n"FleetSCAM" is probably more discussed than "FleetCOMM".\nOne of the delays was because Slade clicked a phishing link and compromised his account.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dominicwhite/recommended/367340/","dominicwhite","Dominic White","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dominicwhite/","1887 products in account","In the interest of disclosure, I really do not like the developer of this game on a personal level. However, this has nothing to do with anything, as I am also capable of seperating the Art from the Artist, and there are a great many things that I have enjoyed over the years, knowing full well that a jerk made them.\n\nWith that said... Oh dear. Oh dear indeed. Fleetcomm is a bit of a mess, to understate the situation completely. From the very first menu's inconsistent (but piercing) audio, to the realization that the ONLY graphical option is 'Fullscreen on/off', we're looking at an incredibly bare-bones game here. Content-wise, this really shouldn't be carrying the 'V1.0' label, as it currently contains justt seven disconnected tutorial stages (plus one survival arena), with the first chapter of the planned story not due until later this month.\n\nOkay, the gameplay - the game claims to be a tactical shooter experience, but what that really means is that it's Asteroids + Gradius' Options with hideously convoluted controls and almost impossible to read graphics. The background (in this version at least) is a near solid black field with occasional dark red haze, and almost all enemies are the EXACT SAME COLOUR with no clearly visible highlights, so in order to clearly see what you're shooting at, you need to hold your Scan button (Tab by default) to draw obnoxious yellow lines to every enemy in the arena.\n\nThis is also somehow worse than early alpha builds of the game, which were still pretty confusing to watch, but the background provided at least SOME contrast against the enemies. Basic readability and usability were clearly not the focus of development during this game's many delays.\n\nBesides that, the game feels twitchy and hard to control in the worst of ways. What should be an intuitive arcade shooter is made convoluted beyond reason by drowning every simple and accessible element in a haze of noise, both visual and auditory. The soundscape of the game is a hellacious mess. A cacophony of piercing wails and beeps that never really seem to indicate anything of use.\n\nThe engine is also a mess. Just by firing missiles I've managed to drop the game - in windowed mode, to boot - to single-digit framerates, which never recover even after the missiles explode. Music tracks play on top of each other. Physics seem to be a suggestion rather than a rule, with enemies drifting in random directions contrary to what their sprite might suggest. There's also no indication from the starfield to tell you which way you're drifting.\n\nSomehow, despite the framerate tanking, my GPU is still running cool. However, on the totally static mission selection menu, the fans rev up, as if it's rendering some impossibly complex scene that I can't see because there's a couple blue box-buttons in the way.\n\nThere's really only one thing I can say in this games favour, and it's that the music isn't too bad, although I gather that was produced by a third party too. In short, this is an ugly, painful, messy experience, and woefully unfinished. Despite this, it's being sold as a full product, with no indication on the storefront itself (you need to check the Recent Updates page) that there's nothing but the tutorial here at present.\n\nFour years of development and multiple crowdfunding campaigns, and this is the 'final' product released. Even with more content planned for release, somehow I doubt adding more of this is going to make the game any better. Avoid. This game is bad. I've written so many words here, but I still cannot really describe how broken this feels on even the most basic conceptual level.","May 25","false","0.7"," 43 of 44 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","43","44","0","3"

This game is more of a mess then Jeb Bush. We need to make indie game dev great again, we need to build a firewall to keep terrible devs away.\nI tried to play this game, i gave it an honest chance, but its worse then a low energy mess, its an acid trip gone wrong.\n\nvideo first impressions:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH3f4oA_ZG0\nFull Review:\nThe game starts out promissing enough, it has a menu that reminds me of that one time i had both diareah and was projectile vomiting. when fiddling around with the menu, you will  quickly find small things like the logo not disaperaing when you go into the options.\nAfter you finally muster up  the courage to step into the world of "4 year long failed acid trip" (if the lag allows you to of course) you will be greated with some tutorial missions that do a terrible job of teaching you anything, and a great job of inducing epilipsey.\nThe game pretty much consists of finding enemy ships, faster then the speed of an old consitpated lady taking a ♥♥♥♥, and shooting them with different weapons (which are specific to one of three ships), all of which offer little feedback when you hit the enemy. Not that it matters tho, as the enemys dont care about you and simply float around and ocationally release bombs which are more like triangles.\no and the tactical part of the game? it boils down to being able to select 5 ships and slightly move them around in a "formation", which means nothing.\n\nBut the most daming part of the game is not is garbage gameplay, or its high end music (which was made by placing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cat that is tripping balls on a skrillex cd), its the fact that this 2d space game that is more like a D grade software project made by a highschool student runds worse then the witcher 3 on a 1996 computer. Why? why does this game run worse then Bernie Sanders in a marathon? because this developer does not care about consumers hard earned cash.\nthats why.","May 24","false","1.2"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","47","51","11","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfangs/recommended/367340/","wolfangs","Sir Cum-A-Lot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfangs/","356 products in account","FleetCOMM, a game in development for approximately four years that managed to deliver nothing. From going silent on Kickstarter backers to flood of delays just before its launch, developer apparently had his hands full with something else rather than his Asteroid re-imagination.\n\nBut how bad can it be? UI looks worse than most games stepping out of prototype stage, gameplay itself was rather dull though that might be a matter of preference, aesthetically game was seizure inducing, bright colors, abstract swirly backgrounds almost felt like it was made by a completely baked graphics designer, sound wise it was nothing to write home about and music was lingering somewhere in an okay category.\n\nThe most absurd part about this game, is that majority of it is missing. After going to chapter selection you will be greeted by varied selection of two chapters, Chapter 0, the tutorial and Chapter 1 which is currently unavailable and will be released on May 30th. Now considering reputation of this developer and their history with delays, I wouldn’t put much hope in that date, but perhaps you’re younger than me and still have some snippets of optimism left, good for you.\nFunniest and rather disingenuous part of this entire ordeal is, FleetCOMM released as a full game, yet with this lack of content it should be considered an Early Access title. So after all that gloating that game is released and all the haters (more on that soon) complaining about him being incapable of finishing his game, will choke on it, turned out that he didn’t finish it after all, but hey, at least it’s on Steam, right?\n\nAnd that brings us to another important chapter, the PR mismanagement. After game got delayed several times while already being on Steam, people started asking questions, expressing their dissatisfaction and yes there were occasional troll or two poking fun at a game which release was long overdue. Response was to ban trolls, then any kind of criticism, and finally nuking entire community hub, it’s almost like streisand effect is unfamiliar concept to these people :^)\n\nClosing thoughts?\nThis game should be renamed to FleetCUMM, because it’s nothing more than glorified wank of an incompetent developer at attempt of an Asteroids reboot.","May 25","false","0.4"," 43 of 46 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","43","46","5","0"

The difference between weapon systems encourages tactical thinking and the various elements are introduced in a sensible way. It is stable on my system, with only minimal slow-down when things get particularly busy on-screen.

When in actually: the world doesn't care about him; the people who have interacted with him don't like him because he is annoying, angry, and alliterative; and his game is a tech demo from 1998 (at best) that I plan on uninstalling and hope to never hear about again.","May 24","false","0.1"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","35","37","2","0"

Not only did it actually come out, but it managed to be a worse game than Depression Quest. Zoe might have had the help of five guys to finish her game, but at least she completed a game that manages to run. Despite having the specs to run this game, it CTDs (crashes to desktop) on launch every time it's launched. I really wanted to actually be able to play this game to review it, but that’s my fault for expecting a finished product. A journalist might be forced to abandon the review because of the ethical dilemma of reviewing a game they haven’t played; but thankfully I’m a blogger.\n\nTo continue the review I had to watch a Let’s Play that TheBaconFromHell uploaded to Twitch. The graphics are very bad and when I say it’s bad, what I mean that I’d rather look at Zoe’s Deviant Nation and Broken Dolls pictures. Gameplay revolves around spinning in a circle and using Pink Floyd Laser Light Show beams to give the enemies Grand Mal Seizures until either they die or you stroke out.\n\nThe sound is arguably the worst part. For whatever reason when you drag a cursor over a menu item it makes the MLG air horn sound. I’ll have to assume that he was trying to make MemeCOMM appeal to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ demographic because there’s absolutely nothing professional about this game’s release or development. The soundtrack itself is mostly generic synth with a few hilarious standouts. Boreal Sun attempts Synth Hop Dubstep on Fafnir and it’s as hilarious as you’d think it sounds. Garm is a motorcycle engine revving and synth mashed together.\n\nI received my Steam Key for free via Groupees and I would say that this game is worth no more than what I paid for it. I would say that the $0.50 Groupees “pre-order” price is going to be the most fair price point for this content. The game as it stands is an unfinished mess. What you receive is a tutorial for a game that knowing the track record will be plagued with delays. The dev team has released no word if the remaining chapters of the game will be free via updates or if they will be paid DLC. It also inexplicably refuses to run for several owners who meet the system requirements. In addition the developer seems to be going on a ban spree out of paranoia of “being ebullied.” So far ban reasons have included such horrible things as asking why the game is late, posting criticism of the game itself, posting screenshots of the game (resulting in content upload bans), banning artwork, etc. For these reasons I can’t recommend this game to anyone who doesn’t possess a masochistic streak.","May 25","false","0.2"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","88","36","41","10","0"

I thought the fan in my laptop was going to explode when I clicked on "Start Mission" and then when the screen finally shows up, a message appears that says the actual game is delayed until next week.\n\nThe only "playable" part is a few tutorial missions and you cant even fire lasers in them and it's laggier than a turtle dry-humping a snail.\n\nI'm going to have to do a system restore to make sure this hot mess is completely off my harddrive. I think there's a virus included in this game's install file. It's a bit unnerving that Steam is allowing such an obvious fraud to be sold on their marketplace. I'll be flagging this game and requesting a refund.\n\nDo NOT buy this game!","June 2","false","0.2"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

I mean it's not the worse thing that's happened recently for a Spaceball, but it's still horrible.  You can't see ♥♥♥♥, the decision making is stupid, it's like...  It's like...  Somebody dumb and cross eyed made this!\n\nAnd that's when it hit me...  HE'S MY COUSIN!\n\nAnd that's when the greatest moment of my life happened!  It doesn't matter if we didn't get all the air in Druidia.  It doesn't matter that Spaceball 1 got blown up by Captain Lonestar.  It doesn't matter that everything went to hell.  It doesn't even matter that this game is complete ♥♥♥♥.  My cousin is alive and making video games.\n\nSo all I can say is...

I did not recieve this for free.\n\nDevelopment on this game has been slow for a variety of reasons, and while I'm somewhat willing to forgive, there are many who are not. I don't really blame them. I was worried that Slade would buckle and burn out, but he hasn't. Good.\n\nFleetcom is a twist on the tradition top-down arena shooter. Visualizations are abstract and distracting, line of sight is low, and every mission is a chain of short, frantic engagements whose mechanics vary depending on your fleet and the enemy type.\n\nIt's a solid concept, but the main thing lacking right now is content. The first update is supposed to be released before May 30, and contingent upon that, I'll give this a recommendation. For 6 bucks, you get a novelty shooter that can scratch that itch for a good 15-30 minutes, and it's got enough potential variety to be something you can come back to often.\n\nNot sure if 10 is a good price point, though. Unless some major content hits, I'd say to keep this on the table for a sale grab.","May 25","true","0.3"," 4 of 50 people (8%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","8","4","50","6","2"

I Can't see ♥♥♥♥. and this is how games should be made and only a true successor to Astroids could accomplish that while shooting enemies you can barely even see.\n\nLet's face it this game is the Dark Souls of the Astroids genre and even though you could spam all the weapons at once making the game easy who wants to that? It's about the challenge and about the waves and waves of enemies coming at you until you get tired of it and go to bed.\n\nThis game is better than any Ace Combat game.\nExcited for the 1st chapter after playing this tutorial.","May 24","true","37.2"," 23 of 129 people (18%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","18","23","129","51","5"
