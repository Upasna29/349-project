"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/recommended/321870/","astralchaos","Falem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/","1065 products in account","Note: Got review code for the game before it released.\nJust what I need after playing Depression Quest, playing a suicidal character known as Jacob Reeves who attempts to kill himself. Instead of ending his existance, he loses his memories  and tries to figure out who he is and what happened to him. Silence of the Sleep is a psychological horror game that mixes things up constantly for a refreshing experience.\n\nStory(Pacing)\n\n+Good blend of mystery/horror\n+Characters are intelligent and react realistically\n\nThis game paces itself well by allowing the player to talk people and walk around the environment without the feeling of tension during the horror sections.  Players will fetch them items, solve puzzles for them, or simply chat with them in order to better understand whats going on and solve the mystery.\n\nBasically the game is broken down into two sorts of segments, mystery and horror. The mystery segments are based on figuring out your situation by interacting with the people around you. While the horror segment is solely based on surviving your encounters by using your environment to your advantage.\n\nThe characters you meet throughout the game actually act somewhat reasonable and intelligible. The first one being a paranoid guy with a gun asking you to go into another room so that he feels safe leaving, by locking the door on you and passing through. The characters have their own quirks about them, this is especially true in later chapters where the mystery segments are longer.\n\nMechanics\n\n-No difficulty mode\n-Movement can be slightly improved\n\n+ Can interact in 4 directional places despite being a 2D game\n+ Puzzles codes are randomized\n+ Save Feature is tied to in-game objects (no autosave)\n+ Multiple interactions for detecting enemies\n+ Multiple Choices in dialogue\n\nEquipping inventory items is important to remember when interacting with the environment. I made the mistake of trying to open a door without having the key selected. Which was a sign of clear brilliance on my part…\n\nYou can get key items ahead of time which allows you for example to double interact with a person and complete the task to obtain the reward instead of having to go back and forth. This can happen on accident, during the mystery segments of the game but not during the horror ones.\n\nKeys override each other, meaning that you need to click one direction at a time instead of multiple keys. Going from north to south however is a tad more complicated than left to right. When I went into a room and saw the monster I clicked the opposite direction but since I didn’t click left or right first my guy refused to look that way (since it was a south door and I was looking forward). An improvement to how your character reacts to the keys you press would be welcome, though they only been a problem really once or twice due to close calls. Normally, it’s not an issue when walking left or right out of a room just north and south.\n\nYou are offered some choices in the game, like accepting the drink from Bar Mcon though i was rather cautious to accept something from someone with con in their name. Other choices in the game seem to really not have much effect on the ending of the game from what I could tell, which I could be wrong, but it seems more like the walking dead approach where it simply affects your relationships with the characters.\n\nThere are multiple ways to tell if a enemy is near the exit of the room by hearing, looking, or having a alert appear. This changes depending on what type of exit it is, if the door has a peep-hole then you are able to look through as an example. It’s nice that the interactions are always changing throughout the game and like the enemy AI does not remain the same. Each chapter feels like a refreshing experience from the previous and never makes the lazy mistake of repeating itself.\n\nAdding a limited amount of records for saving in a new difficulty mode might give the game a bit more challenge that people would like. It's a minor negative that hardly effected my enjoyment of the game it's simply something nice that could be expanded on later.\n\nVisuals (Atmosphere)\n\n+Fluid animation\n+Music/Sounds follow events well\n+Transparent objects make world easily visible but keeps complexity\n+Characters have color to highlight importance\n\nHaving alot of background characters can be confusing unless you differentiate them from the important characters who actually further the storyline. In Silence of Sleep this is done by coloring a unique aspect of the person,whether it be their tie,hair, or other characteristics of them.\n\nThe sounds from enemies to the crackling of the fireplace is all well done and really help you either feel fear or warmth. The sound just strikes the right balance, and never feels tedious or out of place. It has a certain type of buildup and explosiveness that is missed in quite a few games at certain points.\n\nSlow motion occurs when you hide behind crates which affects the sounds everything produces. It can transform sounds from sounding relaxing to something of horror. The visuals are also affected when hiding and make everything appear red.\n\nEnemy AI\n\n+Progressive AI\n\nHiding within the environment and sneaking past enemies is the only way to ensure survival.\n\nThe game is more of a hybrid between thriller and horror. There are some encounters where they will show a viewport of the monster to give you enough time to react, by finding a hiding place. While other encounters you simply have to pay attention to the sounds they make and use the exit mechanics to your advantage.  Think of Chapter 1 as the tutorial for survival, the various encounters you face involve enemies traveling a certain distance and you gauging when to leave rooms or not.. Once you are thrown into the abyss that is Chapter 2 you will face with enemies with better AI that will chase you unless you hide yourself away from them using the environment.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe game manages to deliver a great experience by making each chapter have new enemies and puzzles, sounds that are effected by what your doing, environments that are well done, with a memorable story that comes together nicely by the end.","October 1, 2014","true","25.1"," 195 of 228 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","195","228","2","16"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/321870/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","For a one man team, Silence of the Sleep is a huge accomplishment, and I give full credit to Jesse Makkonen for creating something as big and intricate as this by himself, but that doesn't erase its many flaws.  There are plenty of good ideas here that feel held back by questionable design decisions and a somewhat unfocused vision. Perhaps my expectations were too high going in, but I feel like it could have been so much more than it is.\n\nOn the surface, this is a brutally hard adventure game.  The puzzles can at times be obtuse with clues that in some cases are so incredibly vague one wonders how the developer expected the player to reach the solution at all.  The design is very reminiscent of early adventure games where hand holding was certainly not the norm and the player had to put a lot of thought into things.  As such, there is a great sense of accomplishment when you've figured out that particularly puzzling obstacle.  The problem comes in with the survival horror elements, however.  Make no mistake, Silence of the Sleep is as much a survival horror game as it is adventure.  Death comes early and often, but a bit too often in my opinion.  Something that a lot of developers fail to grasp is that while death is indeed scary, frequent death is not and only leads to frustration and a break in immersion. This is where I feel the game began to lose me.\n\nChapter 2 started off great, but by the end I wanted to crack my keyboard in half.  Not only are you dealing with some  pretty difficult puzzles, but you're continually interrupted from your train of thought by monsters that randomly appear, chasing you into hiding to wait them out lest you end up splattered on the wall.  Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with difficulty in games, but it's a fine line to walk, especially when you're asking not only for difficulty in thought but also in mechanics at the same time.  If you're giving me a puzzle to solve, give me the time to solve it, forcing me to flee and continually reset my thought process is not fun or scary, it's  rage inducing.\n\nThings manage to ease up once you move past that particular area, but then we go from extreme frustration to extreme boredom in Chapter 3.  Just when you feel like you're finally getting somewhere with the story, things slow to a crawl and you're forced through mundane tasks for far too long before the action picks up again. I understand that Makkonen was steering the narrative in a particular direction, but the pacing is uneven and thematic tone all over the place.  I can't help but feel that the game would have been more effective as either an old school adventure with crazy difficult puzzles or straight survival horror with a bit more mechanical complexity.  Juxtaposing the two genres reveals the flaws in both while at the same time stifling the narrative flow.\n\nAll of that said, the presentation is phenomenal. There is plenty to admire from the unique puzzles to the interesting mini-games that are sprinkled throughout, most of which are stylistically implemented.  And then there are segments that pull you out of the standard gameplay and have you crawling through drain pipes or slowly shambling down a hallway that gets darker and darker with the disgusting and disturbing sounds eventually drowning everything out.  These segments are excellent at conveying a sense of foreboding and claustrophobia.\n\nThe atmosphere is artfully crafted with sound design that brings this horrific world to life.  Some of the audio distortions were extremely disturbing in an almost hypnotic way; there's nothing freakier than hearing a baby's cry morph into almost inhuman moans...creepy stuff.  But above all, the artwork.  My God, this is a beautiful game in the  grittiest, ugliest sense of the word.  Jesse Makkonen designed everything himself from the ground up, and that should be commended.  His eye for interesting and emotive imagery is spectacular with some of the most artistic graphical design I've seen in an indie title.\n\nThe story is also fairly good and doesn't quite go in the direction one might expect.  Although the end felt a little rushed and some elements seem to come out of left field, it gives you plenty to think about and possibly a reason to play through it again as there are clues spread throughout that will help further puzzle together what really happened.\n\nAnd that's where I think I'm the most disappointed.  Silence of the Sleep is a horror game that tells an interesting story in a unique and creative way, yet its deficiencies prevent its massive potential from ever fully realizing.  And that is why I must ultimately give it a lower score despite really wanting to support this developer.    I would recommend the game to those who are interested in an difficult experience, but if you're looking for the next great horror story along the lines of Silent Hill or even The Cat Lady, unfortunately, Silence of the Sleep is not it.  Given more time and perhaps another try at the genre, however, I believe Jesse Makkonen may yet get there.\n\nBottom Line 5/10","October 20, 2014","false","12.4"," 231 of 283 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","231","283","2","20"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bernardoone/recommended/321870/","bernardoone","BernardoOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bernardoone/","4943 products in account","A horror/psychlogical thriller adventure game where you play as Jacob Reeves, a man that has killed himself. He wakes up in a strange hotel without any memories of his past life. There he finds a strange bartender that, while giving more questions than answers, gives somehow of a pointing finger to your next ordeal.\nYou must solve diverse puzzles/quests and avoid the monsters/ghosts to progress and try to find out who you are and what you are doing exactly on this strange place.\n\nThe game has two diverse sections you go and alternate through. The mistery one, where the atmosphere is somewhat more calm and soothing, and you can interact with various others inhabitants of this strange world and get to know it better, trying to work your way with other character's requests and hopefully getting to learn more about them. And then there's the horror section, where the exact same world that was quite pleasant before takes a dark turn, and you have to learn how to avoid and run from dreadful monsters that will kill you if they get their "hands" on you. For this, the game uses a gameplay mechanic where you can see what's happening behind a door, or listen to it, and progress only when the cues you got from that mechanic indicate that you are good to go.\n\nWhich in turn makes me want to talk about the sound design of the game, which is absolutely wonderful. The sounds is expertly used as a game mechanic to avoid the monsters but also as a great tool to set an interesting,compelling and even scary atmosphere. It also has a great soundtrack, with songs that fit the game perfectly and are used just at the right moment.\n\n\nThen there's the overall artstyle and animation of the game. The artstyle is absolutely gorgeous to look at, and often there's sights that make you want to take a screenshot and just use it as your wallpaper immediately. The differences between the dark/light versions of the same world create a striking and unsettling atmosphere that further adds to the sense of mistery and tension the game has. The animation quality is also pretty good, movement is fluid and the animations itselft are pretty rich in variety.\n\n\n\nThe only negatives I can point out:\n\n-Controls. In this game, despite being 2D, you actually can move your 4 directions. Left,right, up, down, and you have to turn to a specific direction to use a certain item. And you can't go from up to down directly, you have to go from up/down to left/right before you can go down/up. Albeit I actually like this setup when there are monster encounters, as it adds a lot to the tension, in the calm and quiet sections of the game it's just annoying.\n-Useful items can blend a little too well to the backgrounds, making hard to see what you're supposed to check and use. While I don't have a problem with this in a general sense, as it makes the investigative section of the game more immersive, it did made me miss the save points a couple of times, making me replay some long sections again.\n\n\nOverall, one of the best games I played this year and definitely one of the best games in its genre. It's hard to believe that this was made by only one person as it excels in many factors, may it be sound design, art style or story.\n\n\nDefinitely recommended and a worthwhile buy at full-price, on of my GOTY's of 2014 for sure. 9/10","October 2, 2014","true","5.5"," 57 of 68 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","57","68","0","0"

The atmosphere and the environment is nice and it promises a decent horror adventure game. Just the controls are really clumsy, for some reason you can't turn 180° when facing the wall, you first need to turn left or right. Also the hero can run only for about 3 seconds before getting tired.\n\nStarting with Chapter 2 you get randomly attacked by monsters insta-killing you on touch, often giving you little chance to avoid them. Yeah I know you can learn their paths and how to avoid them, but at the same time you are supposed to find your way in a labyrinth of same-looking rooms, find hidden items and solve complicated cryptic illogical puzzles. Even after an hour of playing when I knew the level pretty well, I still got regularly killed resetting my progress to the only savepoint in the level. Also it forces you to spend a lot of time just waiting for the monster to finally go away (over and over and over again). This is not scary at all, it's just annoying, frustrating and boring.\n\nChapter 3 is completely different but not better. The monsters are gone but so is the atmosphere. This chapter consists of a bunch of dumb fetch quests (find a lost bunny, get a toilet paper, ask everyone some question, ...) and running around trying to find out what the game wants you to do next.\n\nChapter 4 and the monsters are back. This time it's actually a bit better. There are two savepoints in the level, plenty of places to hide and a MAP! Finally! I realized why I had liked Amnesia so much. Unlike this game Amnesia didn't throw a monster on you every 30 seconds and it didn't kill you every 2 minutes.\n\nChapter 5. This one consists of a ton of cutscenes (this game has more endings than The Lord of the Rings trilogy) and pointless "walk right" sections. The biggest problem is that there is no savepoint and the cut-scenes and dialogues are not skippable! On my first playthrough the game crashed after a few minutes, returning me back to the end of Chapter 4. So after restart I had to watch the cutscenes and click through the dialogues again. Then I got to a level so dark I could barely see anything. I heard a telephone ringing but couldn't see it so I continued walking right and suddenly I got instantly killed by a monster. Back to chapter 4!! The third time I didn't miss the telephone booth but the game crashed again. BACK TO CHAPTER 4!!! Finally I was able to finish this damn game. The ending was... ok, I guess. Not very surprising, I expected something like that, but it could have been worse.\n\nOverall: Not many games were able to make me scream on the screen like crazy. Silence of the Sleep did it several times. Both thumbs down.","April 18, 2015","false","8.0"," 64 of 83 people (77%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","77","64","83","13","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/321870/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Now here's a real curveball from the horror genre. Silence of the Sleep looks very much like another Lone Survivor-style side-scrolling horror game, and it is, for a little while. Then it turns into something very, very different, and the change is not altogether unwelcome. I'm going to have to spoil some things about how the game is laid out, because it's very hard to give a proper recommendation without speaking on the game's true structure. However, if what I tell you sounds good, spoilers shouldn't really hurt the experience.\n\nYou play as Jacob Reeves, a very sad man who opens the game by chucking himself off a cliff. However, instead of Kratosing through a pantheon, he ends up in a strange, dilapidated hotel with a man I can only assume is the bartender from The Shining. They have a nice talk, and then a shadow thing tries to find and eat Jacob. So, we're off to a pretty good spooky start, right?\n\nThe elevator out of the hotel takes Jacob to a black-tie affair in a swanky ballroom. Suddenly the game turns into an adventure game, with Jacob chatting with guests and trying to work out some odd puzzles. There's still a dreamlike veneer over everything that ties back to the hotel opening, but the tone is completely different. After the ballroom is another horror segment, and a very effective one. But after that the game launches into its longest chapter, which has almost zero horror elements throughout. It's nearly all dialog and dealing with NPCs, with hardly even any puzzles to work out.\n\nThe end takes it back to horrorland and ties it all together, but all told the game is way more adventure than horror. And that rather works to its benefit, actually. The horror segments can be clumsy and frustrating, with hiding mechanics more touchy than those in Knock Knock and the same navigation problems that plagued Lone Survivor and Claire. I will admit that the spooky bits have some very effective monsters and moments, but playing through them quickly became more tiring than the dialog-heavy parts, strangely enough. The characters of Silence of the Sleep are all well-written and fully-realized, each with goals and hangups to explore. They also make it easier to know how to move the story forward than the scurrying about darkened hallways.\n\nAll of this is presented in rich, detailed backdrops for the silhouetted characters to break out against. Silence is a very good-looking game, with some clever uses of its 2D style. The sound design is solid as well, and while the controls are a little stiff, it won't matter much outside of fleeing monsters. I'm not a big fan of this particular story archetype, but Silence of the Sleep had the presentation and the polish to keep me engaged all the way through.","October 28, 2015","true","0.4"," 45 of 53 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","45","53","0","0"

The protagonist kills himself for reasons unknown and awakens in a mysterious place where he meets a barkeep who might as well be the devil in disguise. From then on, he has to solve puzzles, evade shadowy beasts, and talk to the inhabitants of this world in an attempt to find out why he's even there.\n\nIt can be quite scary at times and has fantastic graphics and cutscenes to offer, especially for being made by a single person, but the gameplay stumbles from time to time. I really didn't like the constant threat in chapter 2, especially due to the master key which is designed as a puzzle and can lead to a gruseome death while you fumble around in search for the right combination. There seems to a hint for all possible combinations though.\n\nAnd the following chapter throws you into a mental institution and forces you to do some inane minigames that add nothing to the plot and could easily have been cut without losing anything important.\n\nLuckily, the story is interesting enough to keep you going. It might not be original, but it's certainly presented well enough. So if you like 2D horror games, then give Silence of the Sleep a try.","October 1, 2014","true","7.9"," 41 of 53 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","41","53","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/321870/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Silence Of The Sleep is a psychological horror adventure game that has you playing as a man named Jacob. After committing suicide you end up in some sort of dream, at least, that is what it seems like at first. But this dream is quickly turning into some kind of nightmare…\n\nThe game starts with you throwing yourself off of a cliff. After that you wake up in a motel and after exploring for a bit and eventually solving the first puzzle you make your way downstairs.\nMore puzzles wait you there, but there will also be different kinds of freakishly large and deadly creatures roaming around from then on.\nYou’ll also meet different people along the way, and one of them is known as The Bartender. He’ll help and guide you through the levels, but he may not be who you think he is. On the other hand, he’s the only guy you can trust and rely on in your ordeal. Your goal is to eventually find out what you’re doing there, and why. You’ll play through several chapters in order to find out the exact reasons.\nSilence Of The Sleep is a horror game but not one with tons of jump scares. There are some creepy and disturbing scenes in it but it won’t ever get too scary. This might have to do with the 2D viewpoint instead of the first person viewpoints most horror games use these days. One thing’s for sure, though, and that is that it has nothing to do with the atmosphere, which is just amazing.\nIn fact, its mysterious nature reminded me of some of David Lynch’s movies, to be more specific here: Lost Highway.\nThe gameplay is relatively simple, as long as you’re familiar with point-and-click adventures (lots of puzzle solving and looking for clues and solutions), but the controls could definitely use some work here. Your character can move into four directions, even if the game is shown from a 2D perspective. You can (obviously) move to the left and right, but you can also move up and down. Pressing E will allow you to perform an action. But instead of just facing a direction while standing in front of a door you’ll have to face your character specifically towards the door. This makes for tense situations when a creature is chasing you, of course, but it also feels really clumsy and requires more input than I think is necessary.\nThe game uses an interface that is hardly noticeable, which is just great for immersion. By pressing the Spacebar you can pop up your inventory and by letting it go you can use the item that you have currently selected. Works great and I wouldn’t want to see it another way.\nThe puzzles require a lot of walking in search of items and clues. If you’re not putting together items, you usually have to remember or find some numbers to eventually get inside something. Sometimes these numbers are hidden in clues, and other times you have to use your faithful flashlight. But the puzzles are never too easy and they’re made to motivate investigations.\nSaving is done by finding gramophone players. So there’s no way to save wherever and whenever you want, and there’s no autosave. The gramophone player option works well, but they’re usually hard to see. I missed it completely when I entered the recreation area/bar/lobby and had to restart entirely from where I first took the elevator after being almost done on that floor. Now I first scout for gramophone players before doing anything else so it’s a lesson well learned I guess. But still something that could be a little clearer. Not everyone will notice them immediately. Same goes for some of the items you have to look for; they're integrated into the backgrounds a little too well sometimes.\n\nAs I said, the atmosphere is amazing. The graphics (in this case I specifically mean the environments) have tons of detail in them and the character silhouettes are created and animated very nicely. Some of them could benefit from some extra frames, but it’s nothing distracting and I can’t believe this entire game was created by just one person. Just for that this game (and its developer) deserves your respect. I did miss some visual options, however; you can only stretch the graphics (full screen) or view it in its original state, which is still full screen but smaller and centered and with black bars on the sides. The last option gives the sharpest graphics, but that should go without saying.\nI found the music to be subtle (until an enemy notices you) and the others sounds (thankfully) less subtle. Enemies make crazy, disturbing noises and objects like fireplaces make correct, realistic sounds. Music and sound play a big part in horror games and in that aspect Silence Of The Sleep did not disappoint.\n\nThe game has 5 chapters and finishing it should take you somewhere between 8 and 10 hours, depending on how much trouble you have solving the puzzles and finding the required items. Chapter 3 is a little slow which also makes the game feel longer and even a little boring but since it's all part of the story I can't really fault it for anything. In any case, it's a pretty long game for a horror/adventure game, especially considering the price Jesse's asking for it.\n\nSilence Of The Sleep is a brilliant little game and one that I would gladly recommend to all horror, mystery and point-and-click adventure gamers. Not just because it was made singlehandedly by just one person but mainly because it’s just a great game with an amazing atmosphere and with tense encounters. Well worth the time and money, bravo !\n\n[Rating: 85/100]","October 1, 2014","true","8.8"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","32","39","0","1"

It does one thing and then throws you off with another, in the truest "what the hell just happened" sense.\n\nThe story is follows some horror tropes, but still finds a way to not only keep you entertained, but also has some twists that not even the most veteran horror game fan might not see. It's an amnesia story, which takes you through depths of darkness and back to light, only to drag you deeper. The game is divided in to chapters, each of which have their own gameplay twists and mood. The darkest parts are not just scary: they are horrifying to the point where you don't want to know what's behind that door.\n\nThe gameplay itself, might be the roughest part of the game. It's a 2,5D game, where you can run in 2 directions but turn in 4. Running and turning and some other sections are a bit clungy and slow, which sometimes makes certain parts of the game hard to complete. Especially on the enemy heavy sections it might frustrate you to no end, but also encourages to use the chapter-to-chapter changing mechanic. In one chapter you are running an hiding from enemies, in other you are exploring surroundings with an mysterious object. Sometimes you are listening through doors, sometimes you are peeping through a hole. Sometimes you are just engaging in everchanging conversations or having your hand in a bloody bathtub. There also seems to be some choices that might or might not change the progression of the story, so there's at least some replayability factor.\n\nThe strongest part of the gameplay are the puzzles and there are lots of them. Puzzles rely, in classic horror genre way, on items and tips found around the areas. Some are simpler, some make you search through every nook and cranny. The game also offers little tips on how to complete certain puzzles and items are many times well hidden (often without having any indication which points are searchable and which are not), encouraging for almost pixel-huntish adventure game logic. Still, the puzzles aren't unfair or overly difficult: they just require time and patience.\n\nThe graphics and sounds+music are beautifully handcrafted: there's tons variety, there are many interesting effects to creep you out and the music fits the mood perfectly. One minor complaint is that the art is only 720p native, which makes waste of higher resolutions. Game can be scretched to fit the screen though without any brutal graphical issues. At the time I was playing the game, there were a few slight glitches, such as being able to walk through a wall in a certain store room wall and some confusing gameplay choices, such as not showing that "E" is the default action button in the beginning, but at least the "E" problem was fixed with a recent patch.\n\nIf you can look past the rough edges, love games such as Silent Hill or Deadly Premonition and are willing to spend 6-8 hours on getting creeped out, intriqued and even slightly frustrated, this might be a game just for you.\n\n","October 15, 2014","true","6.8"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","2"

Atmosphere is creepy and tense, even when everything seems to be quiet for a while. Silent Hill inspirations are quite heavy in my opinion. Quick summary of its pros and cons:\n\nAdvantages:\nGrim, heavy climax,\nNice tempo swings - pace of the game changes rapidly and at unexpected moments,\nPlot is complex and unclear up to the very end (though it may be disadvantage for some),\nSneaking mechanics are quite interesting, with all this hiding and hearing.\nArt!Disadvantages:\nControls are choppy, which can be frustrating when running away from monsters,\nHorrors are scary, but you bump into them just too often, and quickly they become a nuissance,\nStory is in my opinion a bit 'overcomplicated'.While these minuses may appear to be quite irritating, Silence of the Sleep is one of the best indie horror adventure games out there. Definetely worth to try out.","December 26, 2015","true","7.7"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

Your mileage may vary on whether they are geniuinely scary, but the game creates a tense and unsettling atmosphere.  Do yourself a favor and devote real time to playing it in the dark without distractions.\nThe story is a bit wandery and you will be confused if you don't read absolutely every line of dialogue, but it isn't a major detractor--it gets its point across all the same.  You'll find yourself wondering where things are going to go next even after you've stopped playing.\n\nThe control scheme of the game is by far its weakest point, however, with a "semi-2D" plane which still requires some 3D navigation.  Turning is imprecise and sometimes lags, and this can make a frustrating difference when you're trying to dash into another room to escape a monster.  The game would have been far better off with click to move controls like most point-and-click adventure games--and at its core, that is what Silence of the Sleep is.  There is no combat, all you can do is run away and hide.  Most of the puzzles are fairly straightforward with a surprising lack of the usual "adventure game logic."  It's not a brain teaser but you will have to stop and think from time to time.\nThe game could also have used a proofreader.  There are some noticeable spelling and grammatical errors here and there.\n\nIn sum, if you won't be unduly bothered by its sometimes irritating controls and want to try something different, give Silence of the Sleep a try.  Let yourself be immersed in it, you won't regret it.","December 9, 2014","true","36.4"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

It's moody art style and tense nature makes you pay attention to the details you might otherwise run past in other games. Add in Monsters you can do nothing but hide from and puzzles to keep you not only thinking but striving to accomplish before the badies can reach the character, and you have a recipe for a psychological horror that will have you whimpering and begging the game to let your proceed out of terror :P\n\nCons:\n- Controls feel sluggish and awkward at times, but this can add to the tension.\n- There is one resolution and "fullscreen" which isn't fullscreen (At least for me it wasn't) causing it to have awkward large black box around the game play.\n\nWill update further as I progress.","May 25, 2015","true","20.4"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","23","29","6","0"

This is one of the best games I played in a while (in my opinion) and I really enjoyed it. The puzzles did not stand out and you really had to think of the next course of action and not just have it handed to you. The characters are actually really well-defined and interesting. I highly recommend this game now for it's unique art style and it's well done 2-D gameplay. Even if this is not you're type of game, if you like horror,paranormal, mystery games (or a mix of all three) with logical or realistic (as you can get) puzzles, then give this game a shot.\n\n\nThe cons: The ending was not predictable for me, nor was the ending expected, even though throughout the game there were subtle clues here and there, but it was dissapointing as the catalyst was something very common compared to the game's not-so-simple horroresque atmosphere.\nWhy? (SPOILERS) When I finished the game, I learned the catalist for this freaky 'Twin peaks meets House on haunted hill-esque' horror game was all because of  baby . -_- really? The character's story in the game was that the loss of his baby drove him to drink and drive, thus ending up in a head-on collision killing a family with a baby, so it one baby's death wasn't enough, we got another one for ya! He feels horrible and then jumps off a cliff to wind up in a so-called limbo, where she encountered the woman suffering over the loss of her baby.  Oh, baby baby...  But wait, there's more: the character as well as myself leaned that he was not responsible for her or her baby's death (nor his baby's, apparently) and that he is forgiven and she and her baby were murdered by her husband who walked away from the car accident apparently and so he is saved from his jump to wake up alive and well in the hospital.\nI undertsand that a baby's death can be traumatizing, but so can the death of a person without a baby. Just the death a single person or the actions of one lone person can be enough to drive said person to enter a world of immense insanity, hell and pain. Just saying.\n\n\n\nNOTE: This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.","December 28, 2014","true","14.7"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","0"

Here's my reasoning (so far):\n\nMusic: The music is spot on everywhere. From the ambiences, to the more direct music (like the bar scene - LOVE that saxophone), it really fits.\n\nControls: Enjoyable to use, quite a good control scheme. The controls are really smooth, too. Even if you panic because of, say, a monster, you will not lose reasoning of your controls like in other games.\n\nStory: So far, REALLY great. I like how it always has something new to intrigue you, VERY sweet. Off the bat, it will grab you and keep hold, as you try to figure out the mysteries going on.\n\nGraphics: Beautiful. Of course, they aren't "realism" graphics, but that is obviously not important. The art style is much more powerful in evoking immersion than "realism" graphics would have.\n\nGameplay: Gameplay is very good. The way it is two demensional but utilizing the foreground and background is an interesting addition to the game that increases immersion.\n\nImmersion: EXCELLENT. I could play this all day, and get totally lost in it. You really feel the spirit of this game.\n\nDesign: The design of the game overall is outstanding in my view, and you should totally get it.\n\nA few small things I noticed:\nFirst of all, there are two options for the game, native and fullscreen. I don't have issues with either, just thought I would point out the fact that when it comes to resolution options, it isn't your typical selection. On the other hand, this game supports multiple languages. As I only know English, I don't worry about language issues for most games. Other people are unable to understand English, so that is a good move on Mr. Makkonen's part.\n\n\nMy rating of this gem would be a solid 10/10. It is totally worth buying.

What I really noticed was not only the obvious silhouettes of all the people you come in contact with or the simple side scroll mechanics but also the very simple features that most people might let slip over their head like it is nothing special for example:\nNo voice acting.\nNo emotions of the characters in the dialogue boxes.\nSoundtrack.\nSlow paced menu opening.\nSlow paced transitions.\nCut Scenes.\n\nTo me, these features are what really struck me even emotionally to further emphasize Jacob's life and adventures. The fact that no voice acting or facial expressions are used are a BIG plus to me because like many of Mark Twain's books, you have the freedom to create and guess what each characters facial expressions and emotions are only based on stance or previous events.\n\nThe detail and atmosphere of surrounding areas really shows and expresses what jacob is feeling and what his situation is. It makes it seem like Jacob and the walls are talking to me, telling me what I must do and what I need to accomplish to find the truth.\n\nThe slow paced menu opening and game transitions make overall gameplay really slow and virtually never rushed making the player take their time to explore and gather their own thoughts on the situation and Jacob's situation.\n\nLastly the cut scenes can be quite sudden emphasizing what Jacob has gone through or has experienced in his past life.\n\nThe only downside is that sometimes the keyboard keys are unresponsive causing my head to be ripped of by a monster.\n\nAside from all of these GREAT qualities, my favorite feature was the story and the way it was presented.\n\nThe story line is without a doubt....the best story line i have EVER experienced in this genre of game. The fact that the beginning is representing the "beginning of the end" and you are playing through his supposed afterlife with other "ghosts" or apparitions was a GREAT way to fold out the story line and develop it. With a storyline as fluent and complex as it was, I could only IMAGINE how it must of been organized to properly tell and present the story and situations of Jacob. Just figuring out what order the story should go in would have made me have a mental break down. Overall, I think making the storyline not take the chronological order route made it more mysterious and relatable and was the correct choice to make.\n\nBefore I end my review, (I don't know if he will read it but..) Jesse Makkonen.... GREAT JOB DUDE!! For a one man game i am astounded and i hope to see you continue your passion and your dream and make more indulging games. This might sound weird and creepy but for some reason...i get the feeling that Jacob represents you in some way and you use the game to express yourself but even if you didn't, GREAT JOB MAN! The game was really indulging and emotional for me and i hope to see you express your talent to more people in the future!

I hoped that this will be only smaller part of game, but when this continued without a break, I deleted the game. This is definitely not my cup of tea.

Forgive me.\n\nThese are the opening words of the protagonist (or unorthodox anti-hero) Jacob B. Reeves as he stands in front of the choice whether to plummet into the abyss beneath or not, with the choice already chosen for you.\n\nGraphics/art style - 10/10\n\nDuring that short scene and every subsequent scene thereafter, you'll notice a unique style to the game, artisticly for one, that immediatly catches your eye. Jacob has a face when dialog is presented, but at all other times, he is a pitch black silhouette shape of a man, which begs for interpretation throughout the entire game. Beatifully crafted envoirnments and characters (monsters, eeeeh) separates this game from alot of others titles flooding the marked.\n\nGameplay - 8/10\n\nMoving through the, presumably, personal hell of Jacobs own making, alot of things are thrown at you and sometimes, mostly, thinking on your feet (fingers?) will get you through it. Some things take trial and error until you go "Aaaah, DOH!" and then there's the frustration inducing "DOH! AAAARH!"\nThen there are some puzzles/actions required, that gives no explanation when it is most needed. The first 4-5 instructions are short, informative and precise but it kind of falters after that. Spending 20 minutes rotating a bobby pin lockpick, having no clue what cues to go after, walking around a cottage for just below 1 hour confused because I decided to take a break, return to the game and having NO idea what to do, so a little (Hate myself for suggesting it) 'objective' reminder would have been alot of help and basic instructions in some places.\n\nSoundtrack 7/10\n\nI love a good soundtrack, but trying to remember some of the music, I honestly draw a blank. I remember thinking "Stellar soundtrack!" during different points of the game, but games like Bastion, Hotline Miami, Super Meat Boy are lightyears ahead of tailoring music to the game, but that is okay! Making a memorable OST would be a nightmare for the general person, me especially, because where would you start?! So considering what limitations there is, the OST for Silence of the Sleep is good as it is experienced ingame.\n\n\nOverall - 9/10\n\nJesse Makonnen -the games creator- and all who helped him out in his 1½ year stretch to finish this game did a FANTASTIC job! With an ending that draws from suprising parts of your journey, to disturbing SUDDEN moments that make you wretch, this is a game every fan of a good story and horror should not miss, especially with a 15$ / 15€ pricetag for hours of gameplay, despite a few pacing problems!\n\n\nSITENOTE\n\n---The game bugged out in chapter 3, where it is suppose to initiate a cutscene. After specific dialog happens, you are put outside the room you were in without warning; deceptivly unlucky that is does so without hiccups, so when you were about to progress it brainfarted maximum and had me walking around for 2 hours before resetting and moving on ingame, just a heads up---","October 10, 2014","true","21.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

I had to replay some longer passages simply because I oversaw them a few times.

He meets a mysterious bartender who holds his answers and his journey to self discovery begins. Avoiding disturbing shadows and solving clever puzzles, jumping at the random bumps and sounds, I found myself engrossed in the story as each chapter presents another side of the world, while the protangonist digs deeper to find out why he is here in this place.\n\nAs the story continues (trying not to spoil anything), you discover that not everyone wants to leave, not everyone wants to know how they got here.

Silence of the Sleep does have some very interesting sound design and visuals (even the pause menu looks impressive), and a decent story too. The concept itself was just brimming with potential. Unfortunately, the developer simply failed to capitalize on much of it, probably on account of their inexperience in making games. While it feels like a very early attempt, if we assume that was the case, it's a really good start, and I'm sure the developer will make great games once they've got some more experience under their belt.\n\nNow, let's get into why it's not worth playing (and certainly not its pricetag!). While the game had some very interesting things going for it, it ultimately just wasn't fun to play. The first thing you'll notice about it is that it's extremely tedious at times, and it only gets worse about this as you progress. It violates a basic rule in horror, particularly in games, which dictates that no matter how terrifying your monsters are, if you're overexposed to them, the whole thing goes from scary to obnoxious very fast. I can't say that its puzzles helped with that either, as most of them are just a lot of running around and very little else (Chapter 3 is particularly guilty of this). And speaking of the weak point that is Chapter 3, all of the game's attempts at humor not only felt out of place, but also fell mostly flat. The whole thing is filled with unentertaining mini-games that completely break imersion and leave you wondering whether you bought a horror game or the Halloween edition of Wario Ware. (In all seriousness though, one of said mini-games is trying to lure a rabbit out from under a bed with a carrot.) These minigames, while not necessarily bad things in and of themselves, don't belong in the bigger picture and are reflective of one of the larger problems with the game, which is a lack of focus. It meanders in a lot of ways, wasting effort that should've been spent on making the gameplay more tolerable and the plot development smoother. Last and possibly worst of all (the thing that made me finally quit, in fact): the puzzles toward the end of the game make very little sense and rely on artificial difficulty that results from enemies that are extremely tough to avoid. Said enemies make the labyrinth environments difficult to memorize or even navigate once you have them down. On top of all this, a new and player-disabling game mechanic is introduced to make it all even more frustrating.\n\ntl;dr: Despite its wonderful aesthetic, atmosphere, and interesting themes, I can't say I enjoyed the game itself due to its many frustrating design flaws.","November 5, 2015","false","11.0"," 34 of 57 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","34","57","2","0"

From here a strange, surreal journey through his past actions and memories plays out in a side scrolling, slow paced and intensely unnerving narrative, involving puzzle elements and avoidance combat with enemies. The man, Jacob, finds himself in one strange place after another, always somehow familiar and oddly out of place. The people he meets are cryptic and often vague about what they are doing there or how indeed they got there, and no one really seems to know what's going on.\n\nOne of the game's biggest strengths is its sense of foreboding atmosphere. Each location feels disconnected from any proper sense of reality, and the player is constantly uneasy about what could be around the next corner or hiding in the shadows. This is largely due to the incredible atmosphere the game creates through a minimilistic and strikingly unique art style and colour tone, with oppresively dark, dirty environments contrasted against gashes of bright red of blood soaked interiors. The visuals, as the essence of the world, perfectly encapture a broken, twisted and depressing place that allows the theme of the story to shine through brightly in this dark nightmare.\n\nThe sound direction and design is some of the best I've witnessed in any game. Ambient creaks and gnarls of the environment echo around the player as they navigate through the game's locations, always keeping tension just tangible enough to keep the player's wariness at a draining level. The shrills and alien cries of the grotesque, deforrmed monsters instill such dread that for the most part their presence is a terrifying and heart pounding thrill. There is a beautiful musical score throughout the journey, across many instruments and often involving the player's input. The overture haunts and bleeds as the story unravels, and fills the sky of the game like the grey, oozing rain that never stops.\n\nGameplay revolves primarily around exploring areas, finding items or clues to advance to the next area, talking to NPC's and avoiding the enemy monsters. There is no combat at all, and if you get too close to the enemies its Game Over. This allows for a tense hide and seek between you and the patrolling enemies as you navigate the dark hallways and hide to avoid a quick death. While this system is effective and can be genuinely skin crawling, it can get incredibly frustrating when you are trying to solve puzzles or get through an area and have to constantly stop and wait for the enemies to pass. In fact, this might be the biggest gripe I have with the game and I spent a lot of time reloading again and again with growing annoyance at some sections, as a simple task could stretch well beyond the point of tension or enjoyment.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly straightforward but fit in well with the world created. The story unravels slowly and deliberatley vaguely, never completely telling the player everything and shrouding the whole experience in a veil of uncertainty and clouded clarity. The story's tone and somewhat ambiguous nature is perfectly presented in the dark, dank and gloomy environments, and the twisted and sporadic nature of the events that occur. Jacob can rarely discern what is real or indeed what is happening, and the player is just as submerged in this confusion. The player wanders the levels in the crushing darkness, getting lost and fumbling through rooms hoping to find the next clue, just as they do with the game's narrative.\n\nOverall, Silence of the Sleep is a beautiful, terrifying experience, not so much for the scares it imbues but more toward the brutal tone and theme of Jacob's journey. Life and death is presented as shards of glass, constantly sticking and twisting into the strange world as Jacob's memories and emotions bleed onto the screen. It's not perfect and will most likely frustrate, but as a grim walk down a very mature and despondent road, it is a marvellous, dreadful time.","January 2","true","9.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/321870/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","The Silence of Sleep, developed by Jesse Makkonen, puts you into the shoes of Jacob, a man who thought he just ended his own life, it's not really a spoiler to tell you this, as you will learn about this IMMEDIATELY as the game starts. The strange thing is he does not actually die but plunges into darkness. He will find himself with most of his memories gone, and a very tricky path in front of him to leave the place that he finds himself in.\n\nGraphically this definitely gives that creepy vibe of anything could jump out at you. You will go through several different locations, and they will range from fancy to dilapidated. This is almost a side-scroller but does have the 3D space feel to it as doors will be in front, behind, and to the side of you. The monsters that creep around this game and will kill you with quick ease are very nightmarish. I did find it interesting that everyone is cast in silhouette in this game, but it works.\n\nThe sound is going to be used as another layer of the game. There are certain sounds that when you hear them you know you are in trouble, and you either need to run or hide. I do wish that this game was voiced, it definitely would have furthered the immersion into the game.\n\nThe controls are really straightforward. You are going to use the WASD combo to move, 'e' to interact, and 'f' for flashlight (which you can use the mouse to gain a little bit more precision on where the beam is aimed. I will tell you this though, if you use 'w' or 's' to face back or forward, you will need to press 'a' or 'd' before you can face forward or back, with the exception of left and right, there is no 180 turns.\n\nAlright so lets get into the meat of the game. You are going to be put on a path that is really a point A to point B type of situation. You are going to be put to the test through each section of the game, and each section has its own wrinkles. There are going to be puzzles that you will have to solve in order to advance the game, and sometimes the answers are not the most straightforward thing. You may miss something small, and that will haunt you as you are combing over each section of the game to try to get a combination, or a solution.\n\nThis game has a lot of back and forth to it through each section as you try to advance the game, there's also layers of gameplay that keep getting added, which I don't know if I really liked. The first real example of this is that you will get to a certain part of the game, after you have already run into at least one nightmarish monster, where all of a sudden you are now able to see through a peephole or listen to the door to try to determine where the monster is so that you can hopefully get past it and not get killed by it. This left me wondering why not start off the game with this ability. Then a little bit later you all of a sudden have an ability to hide from the monsters. Now I'm all for adding layers of complexity to the game, but this just feels like the developer decided to come up with ideas and throw them in as they went, never thinking about previous sections.\n\nThis is a tough game, and there's going to be those moments of absolute frustration, but as long as you save, A LOT, by interacting with the record players you find, you might find a hidden gem here. Personally this game doesn't feel as polished as I think it could have been, but there's definitely something to the game that kept me coming back. The story was interesting, I wasn't a HUGE fan of the font being used for dialogue, actually that was not a good choice, but the font didn't bother me to the point where I wanted to stop playing.\n\nThis is actually one tough game to rate. There are parts of the game that I didn't like and then there were pieces of the game that I liked. It is a good game, but at the same time there are things that just don't rub me the right way. So I guess I'm going to have to say that this game gets a 6.9 out of 10.","November 14, 2014","true","1.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

At first the game allows you to explore the world without danger. However, the mysterious atmosphere creates plenty of tension. I was genuinely enjoying taking in each location, and teasing out each puzzles.\n\nThen the game introduced monsters that kill you in one hit.\n\nTension turned to frustration. I'd be in the middle of a puzzle, and every half a minute a monster would spook on up to me, and I'd just have to hide behind some boxes. Over and over and over. It was like the game was actively discouraging me from progressing.\n\nMonsters worked in games like Silent Hill because you had plenty of options for how you wanted to deal with them. They also wouldn't interrupt you in the middle of a puzzle, if you'd cleared out the room. There were rules in that world which allowed enemies to coexist with the more exploratory nature of Silent Hill.\n\nBut the 2D world of Silence of the Sleep removes many of these options. The monster gameplay becomes a dull 'run the opposite way' goose chase, until you find some boxes to hide within, or hit a dead end and start over. It's incredibly restrictive.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, but it just reminded me of better horrors. Hopefully the developer's next game, the Human Gallery, plays to its strengths, rather than introducing needless elements.","June 24, 2015","false","2.7"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

The sprinting was a little buggy and would cut out randomly while holding down the shift key (I even switched keyboards to double check it wasn't user error), but it was only a small annoyance at most, and I was generally too focused on running away from something to care enough anyways...Aside from that, moving back and forth while avoiding monsters can get a little monotonous after a while, but for the most part, again, you're too busy running away from them to care too much.\n\nSo overall, I find this to be a great game!

This is actually one of the main cons in the game which almost gave the game it's downfall but thank god chapter 5 saved it from turning the game into a disaster because I was enjoying the game a lot & I just want to mention in Chapter 2 with the monsters in the motel as much as they only had a repeated pattern of walking they didn't move slow as hell so hopefully more of that tension in your next game & if your going to add a sewer level please add something new in the plate because backtracking isn't fun or scary. My final issue is the controls for moving your character I'm just going to be blunt I hate turning my character like a ballerina a lot in the calm sections but I didn't mind it when I'm chased by monsters because it added tension for me so that's the last con to mention but hopefully the next game won't make me twirl around like an idiot the entire game.\n\nNow for the accomplishments the one man game dev delivered an awesome story to get addicted on (The game lasts around 10-11 hours but it depends on how good you are at puzzles because I sucked at some puzzles & sadly there is no voice acting in the game so you have to read all the text) despite the game having some common horror tropes the game manages to remain fresh with a unique animation style, great music, weird shadow monsters (I think that's where the Silent Hill influence kicks in), some cool puzzles (I'm leaving out the sewer puzzles because that level sucked) & a bunch of interesting NPCs like the mysterious bartender for example but I could just ramble on forever on what the game did right but I can't do that because there is a limit of how many words I can type so overall on a good sale or if you want to pay full price you have to check this game out.\n\nBonus: An official short film for the game has been made https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpHRpt4VX3Y\n\nBonus 2: The game dev is making a new psychological horror game called The Human Gallery so keep your eyes on that game in the future https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwWvdCW5ATM\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=408270544\n\nEDIT: The game dev takes feedback seriously & I respect that kind of passion","February 18, 2015","true","11.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","2"

He constantly checks his Facebook, Twitter, and Steam page, commenting on people needing help, their opinions, and thanking people for their support.\nSilence of the Sleep is a very uniquely designed horror adventure puzzle game. The biggest noticeable thing is that it’s a side scroller, but don’t let that fool you, that doesn’t take away from its horror elements. In fact it even improves its puzzle and adventure elements. The horror bit consists of the standard jump scares, but that’s just the cherry on top. The real fear is from personal anxiety and paranoia. The game isn’t all about horror though. There are some parts where there are no threats, and its pure exploration and talking to other characters. There are in total 5 chapters of gameplay, with chapter 3 focused on story and being relatively calm and 5 being the ending which is more handheld than anything. The game has a very similar feel to older horror games, specifically point and clicks. In General the game took me about 9 hours to beat, however some ran through it way faster or slower.\n\nPros\nUnique design\nInteresting color scheme\nInteresting characters\nFulfilling ending\nFANTASTIC music\nEmotionally investing\n\nCons\nCertain areas drag on a tad (house)\nAfter a few deaths on a monster, that monster loses its scary element (it comes back with others)\nCertain parts is just remember the monsters path (sewers)\nNot necessarily a con but the game gives you multiple dialogue and action options, but they will only affect minor things, if at all.\n\nI personally think the game is worth its price tag, however I did get it through the auctions, so my 2 cents might not be as valuable.

The puzzles are mostly bland and unsatisfying, the characters and monsters lack imagination, and I don't see a lot of originality. To put it blunty, the first few seconds of the game are the most interesting.\n\nSPOILERS:\n\nJust to cover some specific instances of puzzles, you walk into a room and hear a baby crying, in the room is a crib where you find an item. So I guess the baby crying is supposed to be a clue to look in the crib. But the crib is literally the only thing in the room to interact with.\n\nIf I had to make a suggestion it would be to scale it back, every aspect of the game seems like it's designed to be scary.

It's wonderful.\n\n- The art style is quite unique which is a nice thing to see in any game, but if I had to liken it to another game it would be "The Cat Lady" which makes it all the more terrifying. It's simplistic at first glance, but there are some WONDERFUL details if you just look - hooking your attention and sucking you in just enough to scare you when it wants to.\n\n- There is a perfect amount of making you commit to awful choices, puzzle solving, plot development, and showing just enough to scare you without being in your face - and I'm only through the prologue and a bit of chapter 1 as I write this.\n\n- The music and sound effects are superbly horrific - reminds me of David Firth's style (Salad fingers, Spoilsbury Toast Boy, Dog of Man). Personally I couldn't ask for more on this front.\n\n- Despite being a horror game, I laughed out loud a couple of times due to little things in the dialogue which is a nice touch. The dialogue itself is quite good and it may seem text heavy for some but I didn't find it overly wordy enough to ruin the game for me. I think the balance is fairly good.\n\n- I like the fact the text dialogue isn't read out-loud by a voice actor, that can sometimes ruin perfectly excellent games and it makes you feel quite isolated even from the people you speak to. <b>ATMOSPHERE</b>\n\n- Colours and minor details are so important to determining the importance of objects and characters and what sort of person they are. I love this feature. It really immerses you.\n\n- The scary parts of this game are beautifully crafted and there are some great mechanics involved.\n\n- Amazing story thickening so far and I can see so many threads crossing and coming together. So wonderful. Hats off to Jesse Makkonen\n\n- Note, I'd not recommend this game to those who are easily frustrated and take stuff at face value. You need to figure stuff out for yourself. I'm sure someone has done a walk-through but if you're a puzzle solver you're going to love this.\n\nI have a playlist for this game on youtube if anyone wants a "Let's Play" of this beautiful game by a sweary northern girl.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxfY8SwPHa0&list=PLggjiDW8CHQWnjZDa7W8EYcpLGb9GksV","August 4, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After I went back to get it again he acted as if I had it already which I did not and I could not progress without it. Also the save point in chapter one blends into the background making it almost invisible it took me a good while to notice it.

The sound design and music fantastic! As well is the monster design - although I feel that there could have been more sections that were horror focused and the build up to these sections felt a little week. I plan to replay SotS soon after finishing, which is a good sign.\n\nI hope that the developer, Jesse, has taken some feedback from fans, improves the game length, allows for more tension prior to the monsters whilst keeping the solid art direction and great sound design for their sequel The Human Gallery.","June 22, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

The biggest downside is that sometimes hiding and running from the monsters gets really annoying because you have to wait for one minute at one place and then do whatever you have to do in a 30 second window and then repeat this in the other direction. Most losers get heavily frustrated at chapter 2, but I'm telling you - wait until you see chapter 4. I finished the game for about 8 hours, but it could be faster because sometimes I was really overly patient to wait for the monsters.\nArtistically the game is very interesting, I like this style very much, also the story is fine, not the best but quite alright.

You are a shadowy figure that walks and jogs around a hotel. The game is made up of walking around with a flashlight opening doors and flicking switches. There is no direction, just you checking every door and interacting with every object to see if it works. You backtrack and walk around doing the same things over and over. The "scary" aspect isn't even really scary. And in true stupid adventure game fashion, in order to move forward you need to specifically have done something in one room to be able to go back to a different room, so something will then be able to trigger later. I had no idea where to go, and there was this box that I knew the combination for, but it wouldn't work because I hadn't triggered the random event that when I turned on the TV in a different room numbers would pop up (uh ok?). Games like this with boring gameplay (such as point and clicks/adventure-esque games) usually boast a good story and characters to keep your interest piqued. This doesn't have that. You are a shadow that fell off a cliff and end up in a purgatory hotel talking to other random people there, while you hide from shadows/monsters. That's about it. So after wandering around and opening every door and trying everything I said "life is too short" to waste time for a game that is boring anyways. No more walking around with a flashlight opening doors for me.

Isn't very easy to understand the details. I didn't connected all yet.\nYou need to let you think about the history, think about the scenes, to understand.\n\nAnd it's horror game!\nUnlike some horror games, there aren't cheap jumpscares in this one.\nThere's a tense atmosphere.\nFor me, it was very immersive.\n\nYou will need to solve puzzles to keep going. You will search for clues to solve easier.\n\nI enjoyed all the game except one parte of one scene. I think was the last of chapter four. With monster obstructing the path every time. Making you go back. Was quite boring.\n\nI didn't find much "bugs" in game. However I found one. I can't tell it because will be a spoiler.\nBut It doesn't interfere in the history.\n\nI generally don't play scary games. But I gave it a try.\nAnd totally worth.

It's pretty good, but also pretty bad.\n\nThe style of the game caught my attention. It has a pretty unique look to it. I'm a fan of the contrasting silhouettes of the characters against the backgrounds with the occasional pop of color. Looks aren't everything, so moving on.\n\nAnother reviewer mentioned that this game is like a 2D Silent Hill, and that's basically what sold me on this game. I do agree, that there are some similarities, but once I made it to chapter 3, I began to feel like playing this was more of a chore than any fun. Don't get me wrong, there are some parts of this game that are down right interesting and fun to play.. but there are other areas (the lock picking puzzle................) that are just frustrating as hell.\n\nBasically,\n\n-Some puzzles are interesting, others are a pain in the ♥♥♥ and I didn't find them clever or satisfying to solve.\n\n-The controls are clunky. I use the default Shift key to run and I'll randomly stop running and just casually stroll. I've tried key-binding my run to my mouse, but it was the same problem.\n\n-The "combat" has some unique bits to it. Once you get the hang of the pattern each monster follows, you'll be fine though. So it's really not that difficult.\n\n-At several moments throughout my play though, I ran around in circles looking for the trigger to move on in the story only to find out that I wasn't facing the right direction or in the exact position to speak with someone or pick something up.\n\n-The aesthetic and soundtrack are both fantastic.\n\nRight now, I'm taking a break from this game. I just finished the lock-picking nonsense, so I saved, and I'm done for awhile. I might come back and keep going because just prior to that, I thought that the art therapy room was a really neat touch. I'm just finding that one annoyance is enough to kill my morale for playing this game. I would like to know what's going on with Jacob though, so I'll likely keep going unless something reeeeeeeeeally ticks me off. That's when I'll just watch the ending on Youtube or something. ♥♥♥♥ it.","January 27","false","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You must turn to one side, THEN you can turn the other way) and there are dead end rooms with no hiding places, so if you're in one and a monster appears you just die. That gets rather frustrating and it shifts from scary to annoying. I've seen better approaches where you take damage from running past a monster but aren't automatically dead.\n\nAll told, I still recommend it but in the "monster chase" levels you'll want to figure out the monster's patrol pattern fast and keep track of it.","January 21","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art is beautiful and the story had me hooked from the get go.\n\nThen its ruined at chapter 2! The repetitive monster chasing is no fun at all and after being killed about 50 times, I give up and shut down the game. I wanted the adventure and mood this game started out with, not monster after monster coming after me so othen it stops being scary and becomes more of a nuisance. How am I supposed to avoid the monster if it spawns right next to me just after entering a room? How can I do anything if I'm being killed over and over again before I can move three steps. Its frustrating as hell!!\n\nI would have loved to play this game and enjoy the cool story and awesome art style, but its ruined for me.\n\nVery disappointed.","May 21","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Listen to those who made it through the game. It´s (more or less) easily possible.\n\nCons:\n- Indeed clunky controls!!\nAfter moving you need to stop 0.5-1 seconds until you can turn. Yes, that may become frustrating when you are in "a hurry/panic". Als after looking to the fore-/background it takes a while and some clicks to make a 180-turn (i.e. from front to back or vice versa). But also you get used to it.\nFuthermore sometimes your character just stops running, so you have to press shift+direction again. Also annoying when you´re on the run.\nAlso at the beginning it is not clear how to interact with certain characters/things: Mostly you have to stand "in front" of them (since it´s 2D i.e. "on top" of them), but later sometimes next to them (slightly i.e. left or right of them). If you don´t know that, you may get confused first, but thank go there´s the internet ;)- Sometimes "interactables" are hard to find, because they do not really stand out from the background. (kind of a disadvantage of the artystyle)\n- Crashes sometimes ... for reasons. But usually takes not mroe than one minute after save points to get there again and it usually doesn´t freeze again and again at thes epoints. So still playable\n- Where´s my picture?! ;)\n\nPros:\n- Great sound: The music, as well as the atmosphere, as well as sound as an important part of the gameplay itself. It´s really great, enjoyable and supports the story/gameplay really well.\n- Visual design is pretty unique, though somewhat simple. A mixture of realistic movements and comic-like animations.\n- Great atmosphere in sound, visuals and dialogue.\n- Pretty dark and implicitly violent. (Sometimes also explicitly, like the "cutscene" ;)\n- Nice mix of adventure-like story progression and horror parts. So you can breath through and relax a bit in the "story parts" while the other sometimes make your heart bump.\n- Interesting and somewhat catching storyline.\n\nHints:\n- Keep an eye on the background.\n- Save if u can\n- Don´t forget that flashlight is on F ;)\n\nBesides the mentioned control issues it´s a pretty decent and throughout playable game. Like with many adventure games you will sometimes have to check a playthrough if u gets tucked (but see "hints").\nThe atmosphere is really great in all aspects. The music is really fits the story and the overall melancholic mood that goes through the whole game. The combination of adventure like parts (find item A  use it at  spot/bring it to person B) are well combined with the more horror oriented, fast paced parts.\nSo some horror fans may call  the patterns/movement of the "thing" h(a)unting you too simple and easy. Adventure fans may call the "puzzles" (which really aren´t THAT much puzzling) too simple. I like the balance of both.\nAfter all it´s a very story heavy game, which starts giving hints on the (possible) outcome of the story from the very beginning, so that you are interested and inclined to guess and wanting to know how the story will finally end.\nAnd actually i missed a part of the conclusion that was indicated pretty strongly throughout the game (bathtub?!?).\n\nThe "it´s a one-man-job"-argument shouldn´t be an excuse for flaws of the game, but it is really a great work for basically one guy doing such a creative and well rounded game.\n\nIf you are a fan of horror and adventure and still doubting whether to get this game or not, just wait for a 66-75% discount or a bundle containing it. Then you probably won´t make a mistake. I got this game in a bundle and remembered latewr, that this was one of the reasons i bought the bundle in the first place. And i can say it was worth it\n\n\nConcidering the control issues and minor bugs/crashes, but relatively low base price i´d give it\n8/10","May 27","true","11.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
