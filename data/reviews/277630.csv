Simple but good graphics. Graphically the best Panzer General Clone in the market\n2. Long single player campaign. I think it take you more than 30 hours to compelete it\n3. More accesible to casual gamers than Panzer Corps\nCons:\n1. No multiplayer\n2. No additional single player scenarios\n3. No adjustable difficulty level. Actually there are three campaigns there (Germans, USSR,Allies), that ascend from easy to hard\n\nIf you like this genre, there are few new game right noe in the market, so if you fully exhaust Panzer Cops and all of it's DLC, You can give this game a chance.

This game is not nearly is interesting as Panzer General. It lacks many features, for example you cannot postpone action of the unit within the same turn. Like moving infantry first, then moving artillery, firing artillery, then attacking with infantry you moved first place. And feature of Panzer General 3D called "suppression" is priceless.\nAgain I've thrown my money away when I bought BitComposer title.

Instantly got it and its great. I had to try the 2nd mission 4 times in order to get *** and the secondary objective. Havent played challenging game in a while so this was a great change.\n\nYeah, there are annoying things in the game, like having to confirm each movement after you make it, or the lack of tooltips.

I have a ton of xp playing the panzer general series, commando and hearts of iron so I know this kind of game and you are getting a decent game here.\n\nThere are some cool things in this game like the commando units and the leadership attachments.  The visuals are great and there are no cut scenes that slow the game down or distract you.  And for what your paying for your are getting a deal I think.\n\nThere's only a few minor issues I have and that's things like playing the Afrika Korps and seeing Panther tanks and me going huh as they were never in Africa the tanks that is.  The campaigns don't seem long enough or involved enough.  And the army you build seems sketchy as im not sure I keep my units from one mission to another.\n\nBut the rewards system is great and love what we see there and secondary objectives is cool in the fact that many games would have given no incentive to capping those obj's.  But this game there are cool perk's.  But wont ruin for you.\n\nId love to see more missions and make the fate of your world for your faction seem to be bigger and I could see story added to these games one day as I like what has been done with this game so far but i always have so many ideas how these games can be pushed.\n\nThis game is crisp and clear and is not too difficult and not too simple and if you are looking for a relaxing war game this is a good one to try.\n\nThanks to the developers.","May 23, 2014","true","14.8"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","26","40","0","0"

Back in the pre-smartphone days of 2007, if you wanted to conquer Poland during your commute (and who doesn't?) this mediocre Panzer General clone was your only choice. I played through the whole DS version, and although I enjoyed it, I also became very familiar with the game's GLARING flaws - a very passive AI, silly power-ups (magic forcefields!), useless tank destroyers, etc. I haven't played this port long enough to confirm that all of those OLD flaws are still present, but there are some obvious NEW flaws including a ridiculous death explosion for every unit (I guess it would have been too much trouble to animate the infantry figure just falling down), and a "fast movement" option that makes it impossible to tell what the AI is doing during its turn. The game also starts off with an awful tilted perspective (like the one from Advance Wars: Dual Strike) but you can mercifully turn that off. It's also kind of impressive just how badly this port squanders the vastly greater resolution of a modern PC monitor compared to the DS's tiny screen, forcing you to click to secondary screens to see basic information like how entrenched an enemy unit is, or what type of unit a transport ship is carrying.\n\nIf you're looking to play WW2 strategy on the PC in 2014, you have several good options. This DS game from 2007 is NOT one of them.","November 21, 2014","false","3.8"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","27","43","0","0"

The different types of the units arent useful because the only different because of them is that the modern ones better in all way (except price)the older one. So u will always use the moderner types of the units. The missions have also not really challenge cos there are only a few missions in all campaign and the missions are linear,there is not difference if u win or lose (if lose game is over)-except 1-2 bonus mission-but in comparison with Panzer General series (from the 1990's) there is much fewer missions and units. It would be better to create a game with only one side of the fighting forces (allies/axis/russia/japs) but with more interesting and bigger numbered  campaigns and more different units. I also didn't like the game cartoon-style graphics and  I missed some  WWII picture /movie in game to increase its entertaining value for a WWII fan.\nIn all,the game is not bad,the main feature of it is the generals,but after you ended a campaign you wont want start the next,cos it became soon boring.","November 2, 2014","true","21.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Experience intense battles in three extensive campaigns. More than 150 units and countless tactical options offer hours of fun. Relive the offensive of the German troops, the Soviet counter-attack and the liberation of Europe by the Allied Forces across three campaigns.\n\nPanzer Tactics originally launched in North America on November 7, 2007 and in the rest of the world on the following year on February 15, 2008. Panzer Tactics was also launched only for the DS but won the German Developer Award for the best console game in 2008. It has been developed by Sproing Interactive and going to be published by bitComposer Games, respectively. Panzer Tactics HD is a remake of the original Panzer Tactics but with a few changes; including new textures, better gameplay, and launches on PC iPad! The game promotes hex turn-based warfare. You are also able to play as the Axis, Soviet Union (Russia), and the Allies. Panzer is available on the Steam Store for $29.99.\n\nWhen companies decide to remake their games with new HD textures, you believe it's because they need more money and just want to shoehorn some clunky game and call it a remake. Panzer Tactics HD is definitely not a money grab, and am thrilled to say that. If you check out a comparison of the old version comparing to the new, you can see that the textures have definitely improved, and for the better. The game looks unreal compared to the original.\n\nWhen you start off as the Axis (unless you have the guts to play as the Soviets or Allies; which are set with much higher difficulties), you are able to play through a tutorial that is great for new players. I was able to learn the gameplay through the tutorial and it's very simple to learn the controls. Panzer Tactics is also marked with the non-complex UI which allows players to not have to struggle with reading small messages or find a command with a ridiculous amount of steps.\n\nHistorically, the game does well on battles that happened during World War II. I am a huge World War II guy who gets his hands on any World War II game he can get. There is also a large arsenal in the variety of units to pick from, in which all have strengths and weaknesses in which players must use to win a battle. There are also a huge diversity in the terrain that you are able to have battles on which creates many different types of scenarios for you.\n\n8.5/10 - Great for any strategist or World War II fan, or both! Panzer Tactics HD brings back the fun of the first one and adds with some great visuals as well as better gameplay!","May 18, 2014","true","8.3"," 37 of 66 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","37","66","0","0"

Like old VWs, sometimes older models worked better than the new stuff.\n\nYou can win the entire war without a single anti-tank unit.  Just recruit more tanks and just embrace violent and glorious tank-on-tank battles.\n\nParatroopers are glorified suicide squads.\n\nYou're not really suiciding units if you're using them to win as fast as possible.  War sucks bro.\n\nRoads are death.  Forests are life.\n\nTaking risks with your aerial units never works.  They will get blown out of the sky the moment you lax on the paranoia.\n\nThe French lost that war on purpose.  Nobody can be that bad.\n\n"Stay together, or die."

This game is easily the best turn based strategy war game I have ever played in my life. For only 11 bucks I have already had over 23 hours of enjoyment and probably have about another 40-50 to go before i ace all the missions in the 3 campaigns. The game looks and sounds great, it rewards strategic thinking and tactical planning, it is fun, the logic of the game is based on real life so it makes sense (units run out of fuel, ammo, tanks are at a disadvantage fighting in mountains/cites etc.\n\n\na bit more details if you care:\n\nEasy to pick up, lots of depth and a tutorial that actually teaches you things! shocking i know right...seriously though, play the tutorial and the ? at the top right of the screen if you click it will break down to 4 screens explaining all of the stats for your units. Weather reports will let you know the forecast so you can plan for your or the enemies airforce.\n\nThis game forces you to use combined arms tactics if you want to excel. You must also spend your resources wisely...at the same time though, while losing a core unit can be painful, it does not ruin the experience and actually makes you plan a bit so you don't needlessly squander your units.\n\nAlso, FYI the units already on the map that are yours when you first start, are non core units (i.e. they don't persist after the mission) so if you know you are going to have to lose a unit...risk them..don't risk your core units, and whenever possible upgrade them too to make them more effective.\n\nAnyway, can't say enough good about this game. IF you like turn based strategy, pick this up, you won't be dissapointed.\n\n\nFor cons there are a few minor niggles...like when switching the view bt air/land units sometimes the cursor will show the air unit but when you click on the tab to move it to, it switches back to the land unit under it (solution is to just click HQ tab and then back out of it, this will reset the tab and you can start again. Not a huge issue but does crop up occassionally.\n\noccasionally, some of the optional secondary objectives don't really give you enough info at first and you kind of have to figure out what you need to do or the best way to accomplish the mission (a few times i restarted a map because of making a crucial error...at the same time however, towards the middle of the campaign i finally had a pretty diverse group of core units that could handle whatever came their way if i read the map and mission brifings as well as reports to guess the enemy intentions and deploy and utilize my units effectively. Again, not a major issue since not everyone likes to get perfect mission ratings on every map..but i do so if i screwed up i started over and then applied my lessons well.\n\n-only other minor issue is that there are only 5 save slots and the music could be a bit better (its pretty decent but not amazing). The sound of your units, graphics and weather effects definitely overshadow that minor issue and make you forget and lose yourself in the game.\n\nBottom line...i have had several concussions and thinking a lot gives me headaches...despite this i sometimes play this game and lose track of time and quit only when my head feels like it shrunk and is two sizes too small...lol its that good!\n\nBuy this game already! it is amazing!\n\n","February 2","true","27.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
