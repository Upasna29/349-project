Since it's in early access at the time of writing, there are obviously some bugs. The game feels completely build around you using a controller, but keyboard bindings are easy enough to change. Over all though it's pretty fun.","June 4","true","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But i hav not tryed playing 4v4 yet but i think the utter chaos would be amazing.This game is good and the developers love it and are passionate about it. It  is worth the price.","June 2","true","0.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
