This is because, unlike Lemmings, Spirits relies upon a sort of physics engine where windspeed is the most important factor, capable of replacing most of those mobility-boosting skills in Lemmings.  In theory, by using the capacity to shape windspeed by adding new currents to the mix, you can achieve subtle solutions to a wider range of problems with a smaller number of tools.\n\n... Too bad it doesn't work out.\n\nThe main problem is that the game focuses heavily upon "perfection" in getting your spirits out, and that means you can't miss.  Unfortunately, the power you have to block wind flows through some areas are a total roll of the dice as to what they will actually do - sometimes, they block a passage you need blocked, other times, they bounce off some miniscule glitch in the geometry, and go flying into some random spot that winds up ruining your whole map, forcing you to reset.  Again.  And Again.  And Again.  Because, through no fault of your own, the game bugs up in specific spots, but you get punished for those things beyond your control.\n\nThen, there are missions where you have to blow spirits up and over spikes on the ground, but where there are also spikes on the ceiling - you need to carefully change the airflow to miss both... but then, there's really no means of judging where a spirit will go in those wind streams but for trial and error.  And if you mess up, start again.\n\nDid I mention that some of the later stages are quite long, and restarting restarts the whole level, where you can again be forced to reset due to geography glitches because those are, again, not under your control?  Yeah.\n\nWhich brings me to what I ultimately have to rate the entire concept behind Spirits upon - Lemmings was a game about precision, which is why having very precise, very predictable effects worked for it.  Spirits adds in this system that demands precision randomness and a cloudiness where there's really no way to foresee what exact positioning of powers will just barely dodge the traps without trial-and-error gameplay.\n\nThe original Lemmings was frustrating but fair.\n\nSpirits is just frustrating.","December 6, 2013","false","10.1"," 62 of 75 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","62","75","0","0"

I mean kudos to the developers (if this was what they were trying to achieve) because this game seriously grinds your brain and will really test your patience and make you pay some serious attention to detail. I honestly can't tell if it's creative or if it just got lucky with how nit-picky the spirits are on the ground and how randomly they seem to move in the air.\n\nIf you just want a puzzle game to relax with and casually play and aren't super concerned with perfect completion then sure, I'll recommend this game (do aim for the sale price).\n\nPS I am ashamed of how long it took me to realize something useful happens if you click on the spirits while they're in midair.","January 10, 2014","true","5.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

It reminds me mostly of Lemmings. You have either these special abilities like digging through walls (bashing), blowing other spirits over gaps or blocking wind streams as a bloated spirit which you can assign to each of them. Of course then its life is lost. The aim is to bring as much as possible of them to the great magic swirl. Additional the spirits are reacting on windstreams but mostly they must be bewared of walking or floating into dangerous spikes everwhere. Dumb as lemmings ...\nIn a level each plant must be pollinated and a certain number of spirits must survive to solve the map perfectly. Your world rank is even breakdown to each level and will be permanently updated after playing. Not many people have seen the last levels it seems. And also the least achievements to make the last levels all perfect are quite rare.

It was a genre-defining game, and one that has spawned countless clones and lookalikes. Now, in the 21st century, Spirits is a promising game that incorporates elements of Lemmings, but in a new and more vibrant way than other earlier games of its genre.\n\nSpirits is simple by nature, with an A to B structure. There are no enemies, rather wind, spikes and cliffs will be your obstacles. You control a group of spirits, born from fallen piles of leaves. These spirits must reach the portal at the end of each level, to leave Autumn and find their way home. Each spirit can assist its siblings by digging, creating a breeze or building a new path. These actions all affect the spirits that come after it, and inevitably these abilities are what determines success or failure in each level. The ability to speed up the game often came in handy, especially when you finish sacrificing some of your spirits and wait for the rest of them to find their way to the end.\n\nThere are always a certain amount of spirits needed to pass the stage, and these can differentiate between a casual player, an a professional. As I strived to get as many spirits as I could into the portal, I saw my global statistics. I was often the world #1 on the easier levels, but that soon changed about halfway through. Plants are also found scattered through the maps, and these are essential to achieving that perfect score after your little floaty friends transport to their next challenge.\n\nSpirits' art style is fantastic. Every level you pass has been hand-drawn, and looks akin to landscape scenes in  Anime movies such as Spirited Away or My Neighbour Totoro. The beautiful silhouettes contrast against the vibrant reds, yellows and oranges, creating a warm glow like you're playing the game in front of a woodheater. The wind physics were especially lifelike, with tiny particles rushing past the spirits, glinging off sunbeams and swirling through corners. Everything in Spirits feels alive and realistic, even down to the tiniest things only a handful would notice.\n\nThe Glow Affect in Spirits was the only thing that turned me away. It is turned on by default, but when I first started up Spirits, the spirits felt blinding and ghostly. I understand that the spirits are meant the be, well, spiritual, but the power of the glow was too strong, so I had that feature turned off. Either way, the spirits looked fuzzy and warm, and their walking and flying animations all seemed carefully thought out.\n\nAll things considered, Spirits is a wonderful puzzle game, both in mechanics and in aesthetics. It's a mysterious, dreamlike and calming joy to play, and is a great break from the hectic action and fighting found in a lot of other popular games on Steam. I recommend this game to anybody who's up for a challenge, but at the same time wants a deviation from the norms of popular video games.","November 28, 2014","true","5.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

I'm also changing from 'not reccomend' to 'recommend' but leaving the rest of the review untouched.\n\nIn the beginning it looks promising - nice relaxing graphics and music, lemmings style gameplay, plenty of levels, more variants to get to the finish, etc. And for the first few levels it works really well but later on the game starts to show its flaws. Most of all it's the controls in combination with the level design. The controls works like this - to assign some function to a spirit you have to click on it and then click on a corresponding button. The spirit stops on its place until you assign him his function (which is good) but the other spirits are still walking forward. And because they're all in one dense line you have only few seconds (like two or so) to click on the right button before the second spirit outruns the selected one and jumps to his death (for example). This is not only flaw in the controls by itself, the worst part is that many levels use this as a challenge - the game uses it's own weakness against you. Great example of this is the 30th level where you have to control three different lines of walking spirits at the same time. You have to be not only really fast but also very accurate so you don't choose unwanted function. After a few good levels the game changes from relaxing to this really annoying attention and eye-hand coordination test. It would be much, much better if you could just simply assing functions to the spirits when the game is paused or if the level design wouldn't rely on superhuman reactions. But this is not the case.\n\nPros:\n-Nice graphics\n-Relaxing music\n-Many levels\n-Some interesting achievements\n\nCons:\n-Flawed controls / level design","July 29, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The movement of the air in the level is represented by pixely particles.\n\nThe music is calm and charming, classical/instrumental, i guess. Visuals are enchanting too.\n\nPuzzles get quite challenging after time and surprisingly hard not only to perform, but to solve too. There are some, where you need to assign the job at the precise spot, almost to pixel perfection. There is also the quite tedious part of trying to "perfect" every level — that is not just bring the required amount to the exit swirl, but also visit "plants" (or pollute in a bomb-dropping fasion from a flying spirit).

However, you'll find if you don't enjoy trial & error, this sense of tranquility is quickly lost. Knowing the correct solution to a problem isn't always good enough, as the game demands a certain amount of perfection in execution. Despite this, I found myself striving to achieve perfect scores on each stage, motivated to increase my World Rank which is a great feature of this game. The later stages being as difficult and sometimes unforgiving as they are makes completing them all the more satisfying. Overall, I'd recommend this if you enjoy a game that is visually/musically rich and you enjoy problem-solving/trial & error.","March 9","true","13.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

That's ludicrous in 2014.\n\nI can't judge the gameplay (it seems to work fine) because I don't personally enjoy Lemmings-type games. This is why I wish I could give a neutral review.","June 5, 2014","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Like for instance, the first choice is blowing which blows your leafs the way you choose.\n\nSo the pros:Game looks good, has it's own style and moves.\nThe cons:not really that fun, would recommend just playing lemmings.

Spirits pares down your options to 4 abilities--each of which are directional--and adds the element of ambient wind, which you must skillfully fight, stymie or exploit to rescue yr leafy phantasmagoric lil' dudes. Simple idea-->clean, pretty design.\n\nAnd a pretty damned good balance of puzzle solving and route optimization... refining solutions and climbing the global ranks is gratifying (I'm enjoying it anway). Easier to make real headway on the boards than, say, Super Meat Boy (smaller community, natch). The gameplay is quick and seldom tedious, with just enough of the old "pixel death" randomness to keep you on yr toes.\n\nAll in all, an excellent casual puzzler with hxc score ladders for replay value.

Simplified version of it. Can be annoying, can be fun, can be different, can be repetitive. Hard to say. I prefer it on Android. 7.5/10","March 9, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developers should feel horrible for making the game impossible to enjoy because of this poor design decision.","January 6, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neutybottom/recommended/210170/","neutybottom","NeutyBottom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neutybottom/","88 products in account","Spirits is a relaxing little puzzle game that's essentially a tribute to the old Lemmings games. You have a bunch of Spirits that you need to guide to an exit using wind currents and the Spirits' little abilities. However, using a Spirit's abilities will also consume it, meaning you need to carefully plan your moves so you don't waste them.\n\nCompared to Lemmings there aren't as many abilities for you to use, but this has largley been replaced by the wind physics. Your Spirits float on wind currents and are highly susceptible to even the gentlest breeze. This means that the environment plays a large factor into solving the puzzle. The downside to this is that can be tough to predict how the environment might affect the Spirits movements, so restarting frequently will be neccesary past the first few levels.\n\nAll around, its pretty good if you're looking for a gentle way to kill time. Each level only takes around 5-10 minutes, but there are well over 40 of them, so you do get your moneys worth. After you're finished each level you can also go after the perfect rating, but this seemed tedious and I never went for it.","January 18","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
