It's written down on a scroll somewhere. It's a platformer in an ocean of platformers. It's sweet and pretty, it's enough and not too much, it's easy on Normal and sometimes annoying on Normal, cos who enjoys falling to their death repeatedly? But that's the genre.\n\nGet into the swing of things using Thief; mow down skeletons using a bow with up to three arrows in one shot. If she's dead for some reason, choose the knight to mow down even more skeletons. If these classes fail, use the Wizard to get to the next checkpoint. You can even fly Aladdin-style using two conjured planks on top of one another, once you turn on levitation. Leviosaaa, baby!\n\nI haven't tried co-op  and I've yet to play the game on Hard mode, but I'm 4 achievements shy of 100%, so I felt comfortable enough to share my thoughts. Finland has some great developers, so I feel good about supporting them. I rate this game "Ihan mahtava, peukalot pystyyn!"","January 2, 2015","true","20.5"," 55 of 61 people (90%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","90","55","61","12","0"

You have three characters that you can switch between on the fly, similar to the old Lost Vikings game. You first have the most useful class, the Thief that can use a grappling hook to wooden ledges, a bow, and a flaming bow to light torches. Then you have the wizard that can magically make boxes by clicking or holding the right trigger and draw a box. You can also draw platforms and click and drag specific things to move them or get them out of your way. You can use your boxes and platforms to crush enemies. These first two classes are a lot of fun and have a lot of depth, but then we get to the third class / character, the warrior. He is just your straight up sword swinger, effective melee character.... with a shield that seems pretty useless.\n\nThe game is very beautiful, bright and vibrant. It is also very physics based and the physics feel nice. There are nice visuals with diverse settings and instead of cut scenes, the game just uses narrations as you play, which I greatly prefer. Since it is so visually beautiful, it can be a beast on lesser video cards, even at the lowest setting. Your platforms and boxes crush enemies, objects can be thrown into enemies or through destructible walls, the grappling hook lets you swing, and you can wrap hanging spike traps around platforms so they don't fall. I seemed to get the most fun out of unintentional things, such as teeter tauter platforms combine with Ferris wheel like platforms coupled with skeleton warriors jumping and sliding around to fill the room. The platforming dynamic of moving physics based platforming was a lot of fun.\n\nThe controls are very simple, and a controller is highly recommended. You have a jump button, a change weapon button, a trigger for drawing boxes or a grappling hook, two shift character buttons, the left stick controls the character, the right stick is like an aim for the bow, to draw platforms and to aim your shield (which is useless when you can easily dodge attacks). You can aim the bow and the longer you aim it, the further the arrow goes. If you don't like switching between characters, you can also play with a friend, but it is sad there is no online co-op.\n\nEach character has their own health and mana bar, but the mana never really seems to run out with enemies constantly dropping potions. If one character dies, they're dead until you reach a checkpoint, even previous checkpoints. If all three characters die, then you simply restart at the last checkpoint. Its a forgiving system, which I'm happy about.\n\nAs you progress through the game, you'll level up to get your choice of skill upgrades. You'll also find new tricks and skills.\n\nThe enemies seem competent and dangerous enough. The basic enemy is the skeleton that comes in four flavors, standard, shielded, archer and pyro. They will jump over pits, climb, fall and do everything to get to you (except archers that stand and shoot). The enemy AI seems good enough so every situation can be different  There are also spiders and bats, but for the most part, that's it.\n\nIt is a quick game, about 4 - 6 hours, but still a fun play through (not as addictively fun as Guacamelee). There is some replay value here with collecting stuff from each level and no playthrough feels exactly the same due to the physics and AI. It was a good design choice to have collectables stay collected when you enter each level so you don't waste time getting what you already had.\n\nIf you can get it cheaper than $10, go for it. If you're not into puzzles, avoid it, because the combat is pretty shallow.","May 28, 2014","true","10.9"," 51 of 57 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","51","57","0","0"

Players are given a set of tools (three characters with unique abilities) and are presented with problems that can be solved in several ways, resulting in an adventure that feels wide open despite being relegated to a mere two dimensions. The beautiful visuals and sound bring this world to life and there is something new to discover around every corner. A lack of enemy variety, disappointing conclusion, and the wonky multiplayer keep Trine from greatness, but this is still a highly recommended puzzle platformer.","June 9, 2015","true","12.2"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","34","36","0","1"

Trine simply looks stunning! It successfully captures the atmosphere of a medieval fantasy world.\n\nTo make it interesting we have 3 protagonists - a knight, a rogue and a wizard - but we can only use one at a time. And no, the wizard cannot conjure up lightning and summon creatures or throw fireballs at the approaching enemies. Amadeus can only create boxes, planks or triangles - objects with which you can proceed further ahead on each level.\n\nAnd this is where Trine shines: There are many puzzles and you need to think and find the solution. Occasionally, you can progress fast but on your way you notice you have left some collectibles behind. So, while completing the game does not necessarily take long you are apt to spend hours with the game just to make a 100% progress on each stage.\n\nFrozenbyte did a wonderful job when releasing this gem back in 2009. Instead of picking this one you should look for the complete edition which has its sequel, the DLC for the 2nd episode and the soundtrack included. Here in Hungary the retail version of the same bundle costs around 5 EUR and you can activate all the contents via Steam.\n\nYou cannot go wrong with this one and as Trine is regularly discounted you can easily find it for a suitable price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kahmu/recommended/35700/","kahmu","Kahmu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kahmu/","298 products in account","My thoughts on Trine:\n\nTrine is a beautifully designed 2D action-jumping-fighting-puzzle solving indie game. You get to play three differennt characters at once - a knight, a thief and a wizard. While obviously only controlling one of them at a time, you can switch between those three at any time, using their individual strenghts and abilities to make it to the other side of the map.\nAs the knight, you're armed with shield and sword and are capable of lifting heavy objects and throw them at your enemies. The shield can be used to block any incoming attack, while the sword is the perfect weapon to deal with the growing numbers of skeletons, bats, and other enemies that you'll encounter.\nThe thief is armed with a bow and thus able to fight enemies from afar (duh), and can shoot a rope on wooden objects to swing across pits, pull herself out of them in case you still manage to fall and perform cool looking jumps.\nAs the wizard, you can summon cubes or planks to make yourself an easy way across pits, build stairs to get over high cliffs or drop them on your enemies.\n\nEach ability and spell can be upgraded throughout the game, like letting you shoot several arrows at once, create more cubes to stack on each other or make your sword even deadlier. There are hundrets of casks granting you exp or mana hidden across the game and finding (and reaching!) them all is no easy task!\n\nThe graphics are among the best I've seen on a 2D game, only behind this games successor Trine 2. A special praise goes to the awesome person who created this beautiful soundtrack, the music fits this game just perfectly.\n\nI personally didn't like all of the jumping parts that much, just because I'm usually not a big fan of jumping games (and suck at it too), and died several times over. I know I'm criticising a jumping game for its jumping parts, so someone who's into that kind of stuff will have a really good and challenging time with this game. For people like myself, it's still enjoyable, and swining around with the thief is fun, but after a while it can get boring. There could be more different enemies too, since in like the first three chapters or so all you fight are skeletons and bats.\n\nLots of good things to be said and a few bad too, still I'd recommend anyone to buy this game, especially if it's on sale for like € 1,- or so.","July 31, 2013","true","2.7"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/35700/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2360 products in account","A beautiful blend of action, platforming, and puzzling Trine manages to offer lots of fun and even some challenge. There are also some RPG elements through level ups, skills, and hidden equipment. I will admit, the story wasn't very gripping and my friends and I would often just skip it, but the gameplay is top notch.\n\nArmed with a bow, the thief is the most agile of the three and you can use her grappling hook to traverse the environment. The knight is the traditional melee character and comes with a shield, sword, and a hammer. Probably the best character though, is the wizard. He can create boxes, planks and floating platforms, and he can also move them around. If that doesn't sound exciting, wait until your slinging boxes at all your enemies or throwing planks on your friends to make them fall into pits.\n\nWhen you aren't busy knocking each other off of cliffs or into fire or spikes, you will find that Trine is an extremely well made co-op game. Everyone character and player really has to work together to get through the game, and everyone fills a role. The thief's grappling hook is perfect for those hard to reach places and she is often the one retrieving experience potions, though she can hardly do it alone and the wizards platforms help immensely. The wizard is arguably the leader of the team because he is able to carry everyone on platforms, disable traps by obstructing them, and he can handles enemies fairly well with his objects. Admittedly, the knight seems to have the short end of the deal as he really only shines in combat; he can throw boxes and break walls, but there are very few cases outside of combat where he is absolutely necessary.\n\nTrine was the only local co-op game me and my friends would play for quite a while, it was just too good to put down. Now with the automatic update to Enchanted Edition, this game just got better. This game goes on sale often, and I buy it for friends whenever I can because this is a well made game and this is great developer. They worked tirelessly to completely update a 5 year old game that probably didn't rake in as much other less deserving games, and when they finished they just included it for every owner for free.\n\nYou might find find a better action platformer, or a better puzzle platformer, but you probably won't find a game that blends the two together well and offers a terrific co-op experience.","July 24, 2014","true","23.2"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","26","29","0","0"

Whilst there is nothing particularly difficult about any of the puzzles encountered during the play-through many of them are fun and engaging to solve.\n\nIt's such a pity that its all over just before it begins and with only a local drop in/drop out co-op option.

You have a Wizard (who can build blocks and platforms), a Thief who can swing and climb and a Warrior who can fight.\nYou can only use one character at a time, but the game lets you switch between them easily enough so it's not hard to link abilities together. So, for example you could build a platform with the Wizard to setup an easy jump and climb with The Thief. It's that level of combination and thinking that makes Trine a fun game to play. It also helps that the designers have done a good job of scaling the difficulty at just about the right pace to keep the game challenging, but never boring or frustrating.\nThe native 360 Controller support is a welcome feature too, and makes gameplay slightly more friendly.\n\nFurther more the developers have kindly updated Trine with the engine from Trine 2, which is why it's now referred to as the 'Enchanted Edition'. The real bonus here is if you already owned Trine, it was updated free of charge.\n\nThe only real negative could be the slightly wonky fighting mechanics, but that's none issue as the game isn't about the fighting or enemies.\n\nIn short, Trine is a fun, well presented Platform Puzzle game that offers a good combination of problem solving, exploring and physic manipulation.

One of the best purchases in Steam at the moment!\n\nYou play simultaneously as Pontius the Knight, Amadeus the Wizard and Zoya the Thief, who accidentally got stuck together by a magical artefact called Trine. In an attempt to rid themselves from the spell and go their separate ways, this unlikely group of Heroes find themselves growing more and more into each other.\n\nIf you are even remotely familiar with the concept of RPG games, you'll know immediately that these three guys should have completely different abilities which more or less complement each other, and that is more or less true. Some points passages of the game are far easier to be completed with one class than with other, and being allowed to freely switch the characters is what makes this game so dynamic and fun.\n\n"Simple" is the keyword for this game: the gameplay is simple, the controls are simple, the character customization is simple (only 3 skills per character, and some few equipments), the story itself is simple and cliché, but the overall environment is charming, thanks to the absurdly beautiful graphics and the really well worked voice acting.\n\nThe game is fairly easy. You can die as many times as you want, you'll always wrap back to the latest checkpoint. Unless you activate the "hardcore" mode (which disables the infinite respawn) you will face no challenge even in Hard Difficulty.\n\nThe achievements are well done but following the rest, they are also too simple. I wish there would be some extra challenge there at least, but in only 10h I've finished my first run with all achievements.\n\nMy only real critique to this game is that Pontius seem to be considerably underpowered, since Zoya can easily steal his spot most of the time. His shield is rarely needed, and often one doesn't even care to switch. Fastforwarding a bit, in Trine 2 they seem to have fixed that.\n\nThe Linux port is perfect also.\n\nDefinitely buy this game.

They're everywhere. The market has been saturated since the NES days, back when sides weren't meant to be scrolled. But they made that jump. And once the floodgates were open and the money was there, the industry got hit. In this day and age, it takes a lot for a platformer to stand out from the crowd. Especially when you consider that it's the genre Nintendo almost monopolizes, with the exception of smaller franchises and indies.\n\n\nSuper Mario is a powerhouse. And all of his Nintendo cronies run the platformer business. But that doesn't mean a billion smaller upstarts can't nibble away at the glory of a AAA publisher, putting out their own innovative or gorgeously styled games. Some might even outshine Nintendo at their own game.\n\n\nTrine is one of those games, managing to nail smart level design and chaotic multiplayer in a way Nintendo always tries to. Originally for PC and PS3 and later remasted as Trine: Enchanted Edition for PC, PS4, and Wii U.\n\n\nTrine is a game about boxes. Boxes and skeletons.\n\n\nA knight, a wizard, and a thief walk into a tomb. You've probably heard this one. They find a treasure. A couple hundred skeletons and boxes later, they all live happily ever after.\n\n\nThat's the whole game.\n\n\nA clever physics-based puzzle platformer, Trine is simply gorgeous and a pleasure to play. Utilizing an interesting three-character system, you'll have to use the powers of different characters to advance through different portions of long, puzzle-filled levels. An agile thief, a powerful knight, and a wizard. He's not really powerful or agile. But he's a ♥♥♥♥ing wizard.\n\n\nTheir different abilities are the key to making it through the game's tricky puzzles. And what makes the game so fascinating is the amount of thought put into making each level friendly toward each character. The thief uses a grappling hook to reach far off places, while the wizard can generate platforms to help reach the. The knight can't really do either, but he's by far the sturdiest of the trio and has the easiest time dispatching enemies. It's an interesting power dynamic.\n\n\nWhen playing by yourself, Trine is a pretty good platformer. You'll be mildly challenged. You'll need to figure out the best hero for each obstacle, and the proper series of powers to use to solve each. It's pretty easy, honestly. You just figure it out, switch to that character and go. But Trine's multiplayer mode is by far where the most potential is. Because suddenly, you can't just switch to the character you need. That character is somewhere else. And maybe that character isn't doing what you're saying. Maybe they have their own ideas on how to solve things.\n\n\nTrine's multiplayer is complimented by the level design, encouraging not just progression by creative progression. There's multiple solutions to each puzzle, and there's usually multiple paths. It all comes down to how competent your platforming and wizarding are.\n\n\nThose are really the only two skills needed for the game. Though it is fun, Trine does tend to stick to the same couple puzzles over and over. Variations on a theme, or making things slightly more complicated or dangerous. But never quite pushing the limits of what it's capable of. And I suppose it's better off that way, seeing as how some of these basic physics puzzles are hard enough to solve with an incompetent party of three.\n\n\nAt the very least, Trine is gorgeous. It's impossible to deny that. The Enchanted Edition does offer some upgraded looks, but the original is still as beautiful today as itgreat was when it first launched. Complimented by a great soundtrack, Trine does a perfect job of really building and selling its world. I'm not even particularly a fan of the generic fantasy setting, but Trine pulls it off impeccably.\n\n\nOut of the millions of platformers out there, this one is pretty good. It's interesting, has a nice multiplayer gimmick. Some boxes, skeletons. Skeletons are great, everyone loves skeletons.\n\n\nSometimes you just need to unwind with some boxes and skeletons, you know? And this is the perfect game for those moments.","December 3, 2015","true","16.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","14","18","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/35700/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nI have already reviewed Trine2, after the enchanted update was released I don't know how much different this review will be from my first review of Trine2. (I'll refrain from the temptation of copy pasting my old review, but definitely check out my trine2 review! )\nTrine Enchanted Edition is a 2D fantasy adventure RPG, where you can choose between three different characters whom all have different play styles. You can get through most of the levels and puzzles simply by playing as one character, or make it easier on yourself and switch characters.\nhttps://youtu.be/z17ZMGjKJrI\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  I don't want to give away too much about the story, because the story is what makes this game so great. Whenever I play this game I feel like I'm listening to a bed time story being red to me by my grandfather. It has a magical attraction too it, many times it's very over-the-top just like real fairy tales, but it's that approach that just makes a game like Trine, shine (rhyme intended).\nYou play as Zoya the thief, Amadeus the wizard, and Pontius the stout errr knight; each one has a unique game play style, but I'll explain more about that later, these three hero's are joined together by the trine, and must save the kingdom!\n\nGame Play: As has been hinted above, you play as three characters: Zoya, Amadeus, and Pontious. Firstly, Zoya (thief) is the most agile character, you shoot arrows, grapple hook and swing your way around the game. Amadeus (wizard), being a wizard can conjure up boxes that can be dropped on enemies, or used to help get to high hard-to-reach-locations. Lastly, Pontius (knight) has always been used as my "meat shield", he has his own unique qualities but those don't reflect my play style very well. He uses a sword and shield and a hammer; while he doesn't help for puzzle solving very much, he is very useful for bashing enemies!\nSeeing as how the game is 2D, it controls very simply, but I've always felt that the more simple the controls the more tight and enjoyable the game. You move right left and jump. You use the mouse buttons to shoot, attack, etc. When you start the game the game explains to you how to play it.\nAn additional note is that thanks to the latest update the games graphics have been revamped! It now looks and feels like playing Trine2 on trine1, if you miss the old graphics or are curious about how the original trine looked like, just change the launcher to the classic trine and you can play the original game again)\nAnother quick note about the enchanted edition: you can now play the game in multiplayer, which makes the game a whole lot more fun. I played with only one friend, but you can have 2 friends playing with you at once.\n\nAchievements: I have earned all the achievements in trine. After trying to get past hardcore mode on hard difficulty on trine2 I never thought I would get all the achievements on Trine, not for a long time anyway. after getting all the achievements aside from hardcore, I literally speed ran my way through hard mode and beat the game in one day.\nWhat that says to me, is that for those of you who want a really tough game experience, you might want pass on this game, for others who just casually play the game you're not going to get much out of it aside from a simple play through, for achievers this is a great game to increase your "perfect games" count +1.\n"What other types of achievements are there, oh derailed one?" I'm glad you asked! Trine (and trine 2) have very straight forward achievement categories: Beat the game, Collect all the things on all the levels, do this with this character (different character challenges), and beat the game on the hardest difficulty.\nNOTE: there is one more note about the achievements, at the time that I'm writing this review (08/16/14) there were several bugs for achievements, I can't remember off the top of my head which ones were bugged for me, but you simply need to load the classic trine and play through that way instead of the enchanted edition. (I imagine these bugs will be fixed soon enough, but I wanted to note it)\n\nPrice: Trine the Enchanted Edition is currently $14.99 I spent 13 hours playing the game, that's almost a dollar an hour, which according to my value system; is very good. I really liked that the graphics were updated, I don't grade a game based on their graphics I was enjoying the classic trine just as much as the enchanted edition, but the updated graphics really helps.\n\nConclusion: I rarely have very negative things to say about games that I play, I tend to enjoy games more then find them annoying. To quickly recap: I have always loved the Story in Trine. The gameplay is always smooth and enjoyable. The achievements were usually easy but enjoyable. the price was fair.\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fantasy games, platformers, or 2D games.\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update March 16, 2016: Added a link to my Trine YouTube Video Review!","August 16, 2014","true","15.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/35700/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","OverviewTrine is the first iteration of the trilogy which bears the same name. It is a 2.5D action puzzle sidescroller with a focus on visual art and environmental atmosphere. The game features three characters - a wizard, a thief and a warrior - which have been magically bound together, and the player can switch between the three in an attempt to fight spawning skeletons and conjure objects to help getting to hard to reach areas of the map. The puzzles are minimal, so don't expect a brain-teaser, however the challenge to overcome obstacles and areas where good timing and reflexes are mandatory keep the game fun, especially in Co-Op mode.\n\nThe Pros Beautiful Visuals - What makes this game really stand out from most side scrollers and platformers in general is the art style. The forced perspective turns this game into a 2.5D effectively, however the surrounding environments are actual 3D objects, and they are simply beautiful. Each level has its own assets, and everywhere you go you can see brightly colored backgrounds with beautiful, atmospheric lightning which at first glance will take away the focus from the gameplay just to admire it. The low resources needed to run this game also ensures a glorious 1080p60fps experience to accompany the already fancy graphics.\n\nHumorous Characters - Even though the game is not focused on its lore and backstory, the three characters have a     personality, and a funny one at that. Through the levels, you can hear them exchange some dialogue that will make you grin at least. Makes the gameplay seem much less fake.\n\nReplayability - The levels feature hidden treasure chests and XP bottles as well as a determined number of monsters you need to kill in order to fully complete it. It makes the player want to return to these levels and search for hidden areas. While at times you will struggle to find that one last missing XP bottle and get frustrated, it's still fun to go through the levels again, nonetheless.\n\nSkills and Inventory - As you progress through the story and gather XP and find hidden treasure chests, you will level up your characters and improve their abilities, as well as find items that you can distribute as you wish among the three protagonists to boost their stats. Adds a certain degree of strategy as you build your characters and makes spending some extra time in uncovering those secret areas worth-while.\n\nCo-Op Mode - You can play this game in co-op with up to two other friends, each controlling one character or anyone can play with anything. Makes the game both more fun and more easy(depending on your friends).\nThe Cons Not Challenging Enough - the game, even on hard, is pretty easy to beat. If you are careful, even the Hardcore mode isn't too much of a challenge. Do not mistake this with the game being un-fun. It just doesn't represent a hard enough gameplay for those adventurous gamers.\n\nUnbalanced Characters - The thief, with multi-arrow shots and extreme maneuverability from the grappling hook is blatantly overpowered, and combined with the mage's "Floating Platform" skill makes it incredibly easy to just swing through the levels easily. The warrior is the most useless of all, except for very little occasions.\n\nShort Playthrough - Starting a new game as an experienced player and going through it again at a slow pace will take you about five hours. While a Co-Op wizard Floating-Platform + Thief Grapple style of soaring through the levels, ignoring XP and enemies could get you somewhere around two hours to complete. There are 17 levels in total, along with a boss fight that is more or less... missing. The boss level is just a "Climb to the top of the tower before the lava reaches you" minigame, albeit a bit hard and frustrating.\nConclusionThis game is very fun while it lasts and the Co-Op revives it at times. I recommend this to platformer and action puzzle fans. Steam Achievements, Trading Cards and Cloud Saving, along with the fact that it is bundled with Trine 2 for a very cheap price at any sales are good selling points too, although the gameplay itself is enough to justify the purchase.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

All of the features of the game are simple in design but intricate in execution.  The gameplay, aesthetics, and narrative all come together to create a whimsical and charming adventure. I highly recommend this for all gamers to consider; and for fans of the genre it is a sure bet.\n\nBy far the best aspects of the game are the stunning visuals and alluring atmospheric presentation of the setting. Each and every environment you explore is diverse, captivating, and charming. The ambiance really captures the mystical aura of the game perfectly. Trine easily has one of the most immersive 2D gameworlds I have encountered in video games.\n\nThe gameplay is light and quick to grasp. Anyone should be able to dive right in, regardless of ability level. But various difficulty levels and a "hardcore" mode ensure that skilled players can still find a challenge. And whether you are playing on “easy” or “hardcore,” the gameplay is entertaining. Mixing elements of platforming, action, and puzzle solving with the unique identity of the game establishes an experience that is simultaneously familiar and novel— and irrefutably fun.\n\nThe story is whimsical and fantastic; and the characters are pleasant and endearing. This synergizes well with the aforementioned atmosphere to establish an amusing fantasy experience. But it also remains light and relaxed, and never takes itself too seriously.  So even casual fans of fantasy will enjoy the narrative.\n\nTrine is definitely a worthy pick-up. No matter what your standard preferences are, you should give this game some consideration. Check it out.\n\nAddendum:  The game was upgraded to a better engine and to add online coop. The new cooperative mode adds an extra layer of possibilities, as the unique gameplay is a joy to experience with friends.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","24.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

If you don't play carefully and diligent enough, you'll miss most of the exp vial/bottle, and makes your hero didn't get to expand their skill as the level continue to become harder, that's the second point of puzzle game, push ourselves to the edge of fun but entrusting us to always be patient.\ndon't forget you can always play local co-op with two of your friend with one control each hero by themselves.\n\nSound & Narrating (8/10)\nyou will never get bores as the old man wizard speaking, it's so calm and yet the deep voice give you chill and keep you interested at the narration (at least for me, to be sure). Thief voice actor makes you fall in love shortly, naughty voice! and that Knight, well, it always makes me laugh to hear him sayin' things.\noh, amazing sound effect btw, sure to fill up your adventure.\n\nGraphics (8/10)\nI'm not too whiny about graphic, but if you can have game that perfect at gameplay and graphic altogether, this game welcome you. From darkness of cave and colorful landscape of fairy mountain, it's an eye candy to everyone of you.\neven with the lowest setting you still get pretty visual effect.\n\n\nOverall score (8.5/10)\n"Not just a game that waste your time like any other 2D(3D) sidescrolling platformer, it give you pleasant time finishing it puzzle and worth all your well spend time."\n\n\n\nIt has it flaws, no games are perfect right? Here's some list that bugging me (you can say con) :\n- since the first level till the end, you just fight skeleton, ♥♥♥♥ing skeleton with upgraded armor at the last level. I mean, c'mon frozenbyte, there's like many other creatures in this fantasy world you can come up to.\n- Thief (archer), is the most played character in this game, almost every single puzzle required her to grap and swing. And things going worsen when Wizard get the last skill, creating triangle that can be hooked by Thief grappling hook. and at that time it become Thief-centered-puzzle-solving.\n- Level 3 fire arrow + Amulet 25% damage (for skill that use energy) is total ♥♥♥♥♥. 4 full stretched shot to big boss, 1 to full armored skeleton, sure a funstopper.\n- The ending was good, but to be honest, I thought I'll be fight a massive big flying skeleton, but em-em nope at all.\n\n\nTL;DR\nsummarize my review, it's a great platformer game, fill up your 15hours gameplay.","April 10, 2014","true","10.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Trine offers a side-scroller hack ‘n slash platformer game that combines puzzles with action packed adventures.\n\nStory:\nIn a magical far away land the world is slowly falling apart as corruption spreads through the kingdom. Yet who will save the kingdom, but three mismatched fools who found themselves drawn to an artifact of power. A lustful wizard Amadeus, a greedy thief Zoya, and a gluttonous knight Pontius all become bound by the Trine. The Trine takes the heroes essences and combines them into one individual. In order to free themselves from the Trines bindings they must complete the quest and bring peace back to the land.\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign offers a great tutorial which starts off as you playing each of the characters as they find their way to the Trine. After you have got each character to the Trine the campaign truly begins. There are fifteen levels: Astral Academy, Academy Hallways, Wolvecote Catacombs, Dragon Graveyard, Crystal Caverns, Crypt of the Damned, Forsaken Dungeons, Throne of the Lost King, Fangle Forest, Shadowthorn Thicket, Ruins of the Perished, Heartland Mines, Branblestoke Village, Iron Forge, and Tower of Sarek. Each level includes puzzles, secrets, and numerous enemies. Some of the levels are incredibly long, although all the of levels have checkpoints spread throughout so even if you die you will only be set back a small bit. The campaign offers a lot of amazing features, but the best part is that how you complete the puzzles is up to you.\n\nGameplay:\nThe Trine allows you to play as three characters, but you can only operate one of them at a time; the Trine operates as a way to switch your characters. Amadeus, the Wizard, uses spells to conjure platforms and boxes which you can use to build structures, as weapons, or even as a shield. Zoya, the Thief, has a bow and a grappling hook giving her the benefit of range and agility. Pontius, the Knight, has a shield and sword which makes him a formidable tank. The levels are filled with puzzles and mysteries, but unlike most other puzzle games Trine allows you to choose how you complete the puzzle. Use Amadeus to activate switches, or maybe stand on it with Zoya and grappling hook before the door shuts. How you solve the puzzles and defeat the many foes ahead is up to you. I played the game and essentially never used Pontius, not that he is bad, but I preferred to play as Zoya and Amadeus.\n\nResults:\nIf you love hack ‘n slash puzzle games then this is the adventure you have been awaiting. Trine is a fantastic game at an incredibly reasonable price. If you can get Trine on sale, even if the sale is only 10% off, you are getting one incredible deal. Trine offers character variation, brilliant dialogue, a wonderful ambience, a fantastic story, and gameplay that is almost impossible to find elsewhere. By combining Hack ‘n Slash, Plat former, Puzzle, and RPG Trine offers something that everyone would love. I would entirely recommend Trine and every second you don’t have it is just another second you will regret once you’ve got it.\n\nPros:\n+Fantastic story, dialogue and storybook cut scenes.\n+Amazing level design, puzzles and secrets.\n+Awesome level up system that allows you to customize your heroes and equip them with items.\n+Great character depth, variation, and combination.\n+Beautiful ambience, music and scenery.\n\nCons:\n-Getting each of the characters to full ability essentially requires 100% completion.\n-In rare instances I have had a glitch where my characters fell out of the map (this was not too much a problem as I would just switch to another character).","April 17, 2014","true","8.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Now to start, the gameplay is excellent. Each of the three characters are perfect manifestations of the stereotypical types of classic fantasy. This game is an excellent romp of fantasy. The archery, magic, swinging, melee, and just about every other feature of the three characters is well thought out and impressively executed. The narrative is perfectly balanced between not actually being too imporant that it takes itself too seriously, but also adding an excellent layer of culture to the game world.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bobbaru/recommended/35700/","Bobbaru","Methadon3000™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bobbaru/","362 products in account","Gameplay: 9/10\nStoryline: 10/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nSoundTrack: 9/10\nOverall: 9.25/10\n\n"I’ve said this before but I must reiterate: although I figured some downloadable games would eventually become good options for casual gamers, they would never be anything I’d purchase. But it didn’t take long for me to eat my words, as the likes of Wipeout HD, echochrome, Shatter, Flower, and even Magic Ball have all surprised me with their wonderful polish, extremely high fun factor and equally high level of playability and accessibility. Now, when I see a game like Trine pop up, I do question the $20 price tag and ask myself, “is it worth it?” Then, I remember the many great games I’ve downloaded off the PSN and immediately become encouraged; I went into this new title with that same optimism and once again, I wasn’t disappointed. For those of you who never played Trine on PC, I’m here to tell you it made the transition very well and without much of a stumble; it’s a beautifully designed side-scrolling action/adventure that will test your wits and your reflexes.\n\nVisually, this is one of the best-looking downloadable games you will ever see. In fact, artistically-speaking, it may be the best, although one could make solid arguments for Wipeout HD and Flower. This beautiful 2D world is alive with vibrant colors, gorgeous lines and environment depictions, and a very impressive level design. Each of the three characters look great as well; they’re nicely detailed and enjoy fluid animations, so Trine is definitely a joy to behold. The only drawback centers on the enemies, which are little more than generic skeletons and a few bats here and there. They don’t appear to be anywhere near as polished and accomplished and in all honesty, I never liked to see the skeletons show up because they’d instantly mar an otherwise pretty graphical presentation. Even the brief cut-scenes that only include still-frame photos look like paintings and blend nicely with the gameplay visuals. Really, I have every confidence you’ll smile when you see Trine.\n\nThe sound is good, too, but I once again have to complain about the lack of a stellar soundtrack. The music fits the atmosphere, certainly, but it’s just not brought out enough during our adventure and it’s also far too repetitive, although you probably won’t notice. I say you won’t notice because the gameplay is guaranteed to keep your attention, but we’ll get to that in a moment. The effects are clear and accurate, although there’s a slight balance issue as the Thief’s grappling hook always seems louder and crisper than just about anything the Wizard can do with his magic. These minor complaints aside, the narrator is fantastic and adds to the fantastical, fairytale flavor, the voices for each character are good (although not heard often), and overall, there’s nothing to get into a twist about. Trine sounds almost as good as it looks, and that’s all you really need to know.\n\nAt first, if you’re not familiar with the game, you won’t be too enthusiastic by what you first see when you start. You lead three separate characters in the same general direction and while you might correctly surmise that each section is a mini-tutorial of sorts, you might not realize that all three characters will be used at once when the trio comes together. This is the crux of the gameplay: there’s a Knight, Thief, and Wizard, and each character has his or her own special skills and abilities. The Knight has a sword and can easily deal with most enemies, and he can also cut ropes and pick up small objects. The Thief has a grappling hook (uber-helpful throughout) and a bow, which she can aim on the fly in a full 360 radius. The Wizard can use his magic to move objects around and he can even draw boxes in thin air and transform them into solid objects, which is another very useful skill. On the flip side, all three have the exact same platforming/jumping ability; they can all leap the same height and distance.\n\nWell, at least I think they can. I keep thinking the Thief is slightly more agile but I could be wrong. Anyway, each level, which is set up with an old-school, 2D side-scrolling format and you must find a way past the variety of obstacles, puzzles, and foes that lie in your path. The Thief can easily swing across a gap, provided there’s a piece of wood above that can act as an anchor for her grappling hook, or the Wizard can move a box for the Knight to leap atop of and clamber up to the other side. There are any number of ways you can tackle a certain problem, and switching between the characters is as easy as pressing the R1 button. Each character has his or her own health and magic bar so if you get nailed as the Knight, you might want to rely more on the bow of the Thief. The gameplay mechanics are excellent and because you aim the Knight’s shield exactly as you would the Thief’s bow (with the right analog), you can block in any direction. This adds some substance and depth to the battles.\n\nOf course, it’s not really about the combat. You will really only face two large boss-type enemies in the entire game, and neither prove to be much of a challenge for the worthy Knight. This is a bit of a downside, though, as are the spawning skeletons that can prove annoying and tiresome in certain areas. Furthermore, and speaking of those two bosses, I noticed some definite collision detection issues with the giant skeleton; whether or not his big sword actually hit me seemed random (even if I had my shield up).(...) If, on the other hand, you want a great adventure experience that makes you think and rewards you for your ingenuity and dedication, you’ve come to the right place. The levels are so ingeniously designed, you almost never do the same thing twice; the developers definitely take advantage of the three distinct skill sets available to the player. Best of all, it just never seems to get old…the progression is surprisingly addictive.\n\nYour goal will be to nab as many green experience potions as possible. The good news is that it doesn’t matter which of the three characters picks up an experience potion (unlike the health and magic potions; obviously, you’ll want to nab those with the characters that need them). The experience is distributed equally, which means everyone will basically level up at the same time. You will earn new abilities as you go – and enhance them with acquired points – and if you can nab some treasure chests, you’ll be able to equip some nifty accessories, too. In this way, combined with the relevant stats, there are role-playing elements sprinkled in with the side-scrolling adventure/platforming format, and it all gels together very, very well. Oh, and if you lose a character, he or she will automatically come back at the next checkpoint.\n\nOddly enough, even though three players can team up and go through the adventure cooperatively, it’s actually more rewarding as a single-player experience. This is because that with three players, each one has to work past an obstacle without the help of any other character; so even though the Wizard can’t just swing around like the Thief, he still has to find his way across. This slows things down and makes the game a bit more tedious. Furthermore, I think it takes away from the hidden genius of the game: being able to switch between each of the three characters on the fly and have access to each skill set when attacking obstacles and puzzles is great. It's what makes this game so much fun to play; the options you have and the way your brain works when it considers all three. It’s too bad that the co-op isn’t quite as good but hey, at least the multiplayer option is there if you want to give it a go. But really, you gotta play it through by yourself, even if it’s not very long.(...)"\n\nBen Dutka - psxextreme.com","January 22, 2014","true","20.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Sometimes you have to switch rapidly between the charakters to get one particular problem done. Some other time you can choose which way of progress suits you the most.\n\nI think this game is one of the best 2D (ok the graphics are 3D so I assume it's one of those modern called "2.5D" game-enignes) platformers you can get today though I must say I haven't played the second part yet and I hope it will be even better than this part of the series.\n\nThere are demos available of both parts of the gage. Go on, download them, be stunned by the exellence of execution in this title and then buy it. It's worth every penny even more though it's on discount on nearly a regular basis.\n\nThere is only one thing that annoys me a little and that is the impossibility to look up or down. There are a few spots, even in the earlier levels, where you simply fall to death and there is no glimpse of a warning.

But it didn’t take long for me to eat my words, as the likes of Wipeout HD, echochrome, Shatter, Flower, and even Magic Ball have all surprised me with their wonderful polish, extremely high fun factor and equally high level of playability and accessibility. Now, when I see a game like Trine pop up, I do question the $20 price tag and ask myself, “is it worth it?” Then, I remember the many great games I’ve downloaded off the PSN and immediately become encouraged; I went into this new title with that same optimism and once again, I wasn’t disappointed. For those of you who never played Trine on PC, I’m here to tell you it made the transition very well and without much of a stumble; it’s a beautifully designed side-scrolling action/adventure that will test your wits and your reflexes.\n\nVisually, this is one of the best-looking downloadable games you will ever see. In fact, artistically-speaking, it may be the best, although one could make solid arguments for Wipeout HD and Flower. This beautiful 2D world is alive with vibrant colors, gorgeous lines and environment depictions, and a very impressive level design. Each of the three characters look great as well; they’re nicely detailed and enjoy fluid animations, so Trine is definitely a joy to behold. The only drawback centers on the enemies, which are little more than generic skeletons and a few bats here and there. They don’t appear to be anywhere near as polished and accomplished and in all honesty, I never liked to see the skeletons show up because they’d instantly mar an otherwise pretty graphical presentation. Even the brief cut-scenes that only include still-frame photos look like paintings and blend nicely with the gameplay visuals. Really, I have every confidence you’ll smile when you see Trine.\n\nThe sound is good, too, but I once again have to complain about the lack of a stellar soundtrack. The music fits the atmosphere, certainly, but it’s just not brought out enough during our adventure and it’s also far too repetitive, although you probably won’t notice. I say you won’t notice because the gameplay is guaranteed to keep your attention, but we’ll get to that in a moment. The effects are clear and accurate, although there’s a slight balance issue as the Thief’s grappling hook always seems louder and crisper than just about anything the Wizard can do with his magic. These minor complaints aside, the narrator is fantastic and adds to the fantastical, fairytale flavor, the voices for each character are good (although not heard often), and overall, there’s nothing to get into a twist about. Trine sounds almost as good as it looks, and that’s all you really need to know.\n\nAt first, if you’re not familiar with the game, you won’t be too enthusiastic by what you first see when you start. You lead three separate characters in the same general direction and while you might correctly surmise that each section is a mini-tutorial of sorts, you might not realize that all three characters will be used at once when the trio comes together. This is the crux of the gameplay: there’s a Knight, Thief, and Wizard, and each character has his or her own special skills and abilities. The Knight has a sword and can easily deal with most enemies, and he can also cut ropes and pick up small objects. The Thief has a grappling hook (uber-helpful throughout) and a bow, which she can aim on the fly in a full 360 radius. The Wizard can use his magic to move objects around and he can even draw boxes in thin air and transform them into solid objects, which is another very useful skill. On the flip side, all three have the exact same platforming/jumping ability; they can all leap the same height and distance.\n\nWell, at least I think they can. I keep thinking the Thief is slightly more agile but I could be wrong. Anyway, each level, which is set up with an old-school, 2D side-scrolling format and you must find a way past the variety of obstacles, puzzles, and foes that lie in your path. The Thief can easily swing across a gap, provided there’s a piece of wood above that can act as an anchor for her grappling hook, or the Wizard can move a box for the Knight to leap atop of and clamber up to the other side. There are any number of ways you can tackle a certain problem, and switching between the characters is as easy as pressing the R1 button. Each character has his or her own health and magic bar so if you get nailed as the Knight, you might want to rely more on the bow of the Thief. The gameplay mechanics are excellent and because you aim the Knight’s shield exactly as you would the Thief’s bow (with the right analog), you can block in any direction. This adds some substance and depth to the battles.\n\nOf course, it’s not really about the combat. You will really only face two large boss-type enemies in the entire game, and neither prove to be much of a challenge for the worthy Knight. This is a bit of a downside, though, as are the spawning skeletons that can prove annoying and tiresome in certain areas. Furthermore, and speaking of those two bosses, I noticed some definite collision detection issues with the giant skeleton; whether or not his big sword actually hit me seemed random (even if I had my shield up).(...) If, on the other hand, you want a great adventure experience that makes you think and rewards you for your ingenuity and dedication, you’ve come to the right place. The levels are so ingeniously designed, you almost never do the same thing twice; the developers definitely take advantage of the three distinct skill sets available to the player. Best of all, it just never seems to get old…the progression is surprisingly addictive.\n\nYour goal will be to nab as many green experience potions as possible. The good news is that it doesn’t matter which of the three characters picks up an experience potion (unlike the health and magic potions; obviously, you’ll want to nab those with the characters that need them). The experience is distributed equally, which means everyone will basically level up at the same time. You will earn new abilities as you go – and enhance them with acquired points – and if you can nab some treasure chests, you’ll be able to equip some nifty accessories, too. In this way, combined with the relevant stats, there are role-playing elements sprinkled in with the side-scrolling adventure/platforming format, and it all gels together very, very well. Oh, and if you lose a character, he or she will automatically come back at the next checkpoint.\n\nOddly enough, even though three players can team up and go through the adventure cooperatively, it’s actually more rewarding as a single-player experience. This is because that with three players, each one has to work past an obstacle without the help of any other character; so even though the Wizard can’t just swing around like the Thief, he still has to find his way across. This slows things down and makes the game a bit more tedious. Furthermore, I think it takes away from the hidden genius of the game: being able to switch between each of the three characters on the fly and have access to each skill set when attacking obstacles and puzzles is great. It's what makes this game so much fun to play; the options you have and the way your brain works when it considers all three. It’s too bad that the co-op isn’t quite as good but hey, at least the multiplayer option is there if you want to give it a go. But really, you gotta play it through by yourself, even if it’s not very long.(...)"\n\nBen Dutka - psxextreme.com","January 22, 2014","true","20.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's pretty good. This is how character switching should be done (I'm looking at you CreaVures!). In Trine you play as three separate characters who are magically bound together, due to the three touching some hokey magical item that apparently does this, and only one of the characters can be active at once in some sort of multiple personality disorder situation where your other personalities can bring weapons along with them. Makes sense? No? Well it doesn't have to because the gameplay is good. Trine doesn't make you go back and walk your other characters through the same level after one has cleared it already because all characters occupy the same space. Good old platforming with skill switching to accomplish certain tasks. That is what Trine offers and it does not fail to disappoint.","July 18, 2013","true","15.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Now, after completing Trine 2 this summer, i have decided to play first one in Steam. And, boy, it looks old. Well, looks are still pretty, especially some places like the Iron Forge. But the physics are bad, comparing to the new one. I know it is not fair. But it was harder to control objects and control heroes in this one. Experience collecting achievements are easier in this one, but still there are some hidden in lava or acid or other invisible places bottles, which made me mad sometimes. And skeletons. I wish there were fewer of them. They usually do not pose any threat and you just have to stand and shoot them, one by one, one by one, hordes of skeletons on every level section. You can skip them, if you don't want to collect enemies experience and if you don't want to level up or get the achievements. Yes, so you have to stand and shoot (or smash with the knight). This just creates boredom in this unique game of physics puzzles. So it could be less dumb enemies and more puzzles, or maybe a few smarter enemies.

In this review, I will list the many things I loved about it and the few things I disliked.\n\nPros:\n1) The graphics are absolutely gorgeous. They're extremely colorful  and detailed.\n2) The abilities of the characters are well thought out, and you are rewarded for looking for chests.\n3) The mechanics of the three characters work very well together. Near the end of the game, I was finding myself subconsciously switching from one character to another.\n\nCons:\n1) The characters would occasionally glitch out, especially while using the Theif's grapple.\n2) Enemies were not developed well. Much of the time, a skeleton trying to attack me would begin running and swinging at a wall. Took away from the immersion and flow of gameplay.\n3) Bosses were not made well. [SPOILER ALERT] I had to face the same two bosses twice. I defeated the first one, then the second one, then I had to face the first one again, and the second one again. These were the only bosses (excluding the final boss). Also, as I was fighting with them, they glitched out. The second/fourth boss froze during battle and let me kill him.\n4) The story of the game was short and undeveloped. I'm still rather confused about the plot of the game. If most games create a story and base the game off the story, it seems like Trine made the game and then wrote the story afterwards. I would've liked more character development/attatchment. As well, the story itself didn't last long. I beat the game in 6.9 hours, which included me gathering nearly every experience bottle and chest in every map.\n5) The end of the game was not satisfying whatsoever. [SPOILER ALERT] The final boss isn't a fight. You must climb through a level rapidly, fighting skeletons and destroying objects dropped on you with the boss. In the end, you climb onto a platform with the 3 artifacts, and you win. Then, during a cutscene, the "boss" tries to attack the theif, and gets crushed in one hit by the Knight's hammer. This wasn't satisfying at all, the battle was intense enough but the end left me feeling cheated out of something, like I still needed to finish the battle.\n\nAll-in-all, this game would be absolutely astounding if the developers were more thorough. Whether this was due to a low budget, time limitations, or lazy development, the game felt incomplete. I recommend buying this game and playing it if you're looking for some fun. I hope the next two games will be better developed, and if you plan on playing those, I highly suggest playing this first to get even a vague idea of what the story is about.","November 8, 2015","true","8.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The characters (which can be swapped at will) each have their own unique way of tackling the levels, which makes for lots of variety in how the game can be played. Gameplay takes place on a 2D plane, but the environments are all rendered (gorgeously, I might add) in full 3D. The story is fairly generic, but the voice acting is decent. Combat is done well and is pretty fun, but unfortunately gets old pretty quickly - you'll be fighting the same few enemies over and over again throughout the whole game. The issue isn't a deal-breaker by any means.. it's just a tad disappointing. All in all, Trine is a really well done game which I fully recommend for 2D platforming fans.","November 2, 2011","true","9.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You can switch on the fly between them to solve the various puzzle sections in a way you see fit. This multitude of different ways to proceed through Trine is also its greatest strength.\n\nNext to the vibrant environment and great love for detail, the well-done physical effects are also noteworthy. The controls are good and simple, and the A.I. is competent enough to keep you on the edge.\n\nFurthermore the multiplayer adds some extra life to the game, as the experience is genuinely different.\n\nFun fact: Trine was originally started as a side-project by a senior programmer of Frozenbyte, while the rest of the team was working on another project. The other project ran into publisher and funding problems however, and the team decided to focus their efforts instead on developing Trine.\n--\n\nMy rating system consists of five categories in descending order of importance:\n\n-	Atmosphere\n-	Details\n-	Puzzles\n-	Story\n-	Combat & Controls\n\nBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading:\n\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).\n--\n\nAtmosphere: A-Rank\n\nDetails: S-Rank\n\n(When we are no longer able to change the situation – we are challenged to change ourselves.)\n\nPuzzles: S-Rank\n\n(You are always a student, never a master.

From it's gorgeous visuals, fantastic soundtrack, excellent narration, and fluent mechanics, it's no wonder this game was such a success!\n\nTrine focuses on the diversity of it's titular characters, and the level design of it's extremely well built maps. Each character has a unique role in the game, from the Knight, Wizard, and Thief - with each character being compatible with the other in terms of move sets, and combat. The games platforming works exceptionally well, and the puzzles (while not necessarily that difficult), provide enough thought and complexity to some of the maps level design thus creating entertainment and replayability in leaps and bounds!\n\nNow, while the game is incredibly fun playing solo, it should definitely be tackled cooperatively. Amusing antics and crazy combinations will put a smile on your face, and keep you coming back repeatedly! However, Trine doesn't boast "online multiplayer", but "local co-op". That being said, it is still an excellent title and definitely deserves a playthrough! In the end, Trine is well worth the asking price in terms of content, replayability, and quality!\n\nEDIT:\n\nTrine: Enhanced Edition is on the horizon!

Fun on many levels.  I gotta give this game a shout out because if you want to just have some nice casual co-op fun this is the game to play.  Each of the three characters has their own strenghts and weakensses, coupled with their ompletely different abilities.  I'd say that alone makes this game replayable because playing different characters forces you to approach each puzzle differently.  On top of that, most puzzles require teamwork so be prepared to discipline your mates.

Tight, responsive controls (I play with a wired xbox 360 controller), good sound, great gameplay, and just a really well made game that is a pleasure to look at and play.

Fun on many levels.  I gotta give this game a shout out because if you want to just have some nice casual co-op fun this is the game to play.  Each of the three characters has their own strenghts and weakensses, coupled with their ompletely different abilities.  I'd say that alone makes this game replayable because playing different characters forces you to approach each puzzle differently.  On top of that, most puzzles require teamwork so be prepared to discipline your mates.

Then, shall we start:\nThough I have never played RPG-platforms games like this one I've to say that it's awesome.  The art ist beautiful, the landscapes of the different levels are enjoyable. It's a perfect environment for the game. I've played the italian version so I don't know how are the english voices but the italian ones were pretty good so I guess the english' are as well. It was really the same as being told a story by a storyteller. And the music. OMG. It was so eargasmic. Such a pity it doesn't come along with the Enchaned Edition. Fortunately in Trine 2 it does and it's quite similar from what I listened.\nThe game is a puzzle-kind that offers exploration to fulfill completely the levels. I'm a perfectionist, so I tried to collect every collectable that existed. In many levels I couldn't, so I'll try them again until I get all the potions and secrets. Some are hard to get and others to find.\nThen, I've to say that is rather short, in 7 hours I finished it (the 0.8 h it's due to my play in co-op) and well, the story isn't very immersive but still is beautiful. It's a cliched one and it has no cutscenes. And the "final" battle it was somehow dissapointing completing the level was harder than defeating the boss. In fact, the boss isn't beaten directly, in order to beat it we must go up and complet the level, which is kinda difficult, but still, a final boss-battle could have been really amazing.\nI should say that there were no bugs except a few "bosses" that got stucked, paralyzed. I don't know if it was due to the co-op, since I completed 80% of the game on online co-op with my brother, but still, they had a bug that made them got stucked sometimes. The AI is also interessant, they are able to jump as you are so they can get where you are in a few seconds! And in some levels there were many of them and combined with the level difficulty makes the game so freacking attractive. With some treasures, which I reccomend to search, find and get, the abilities of the three characters improve so much.\nI also reccomend to play it in co-op when someone with whom you can talk, sometimes was really funny when we both died in the same stupid way xD Ah, the levels that you complet on co-op are also completed in the Single Player, so be aware of it.\nThat's all. Ah, another thing. There are two versions of the game, the Enhanced one and the Original. I played all the game with the Enhanced one, which has the same graphic engine as Trine 2. I opened the Original one a few minuts ago and I've to say I prefer the Enhanced, whose graphics are more... soft.\nThanks for reading.","March 16, 2015","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Probably more fun in co-op mode but the game still works fine in single player.\n\nThe basic story in Trine is that one night, Zoya the thief, Amadeus the Wizard, and Pontius the knight, touch a magical object known as the trine at the same time, thus disappearing from the Astral Academy. Zoya was there to scavenge for treasures as the Academy had recently been evacuated due to the incoming undead army. Adameus stayed behind to work  on potions, and Pontius had only just arrived, convinced he was supposed to protect the academy. Binded by the trine, the trio work together and adventure through forests, tombs, catacombs, castles, to try and find the artifacts that would break the spell.\n\nAs a sidescrolling 3D game it has a remarkable attention to detail. The backgrounds are filled with art pieces and the levels are designed rather well, never being repetitive in style or layout. The enemies are repetitive though, aside from the few bosses. The gameplay consists of using each of the characters special abilities to get past blocks in the path, etc.\n\nAnyway, I really liked it.\n\n9/10","June 19, 2015","true","4.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a physics platformer with a rather unique mechanic of 3 playable characters.  They are tied together by magic so you can switch between them at any time and use their abilities to make your way through the levels.  Puzzles are quite varied requiring a number of different strategies, especially if you want to collect all the experience orbs which can be quite difficult to reach.  All of the characters are well-balanced and necessary to proceed through the game.  The game is also very well-written and acted which is a welcome change from most platformers.\n\nWhere Trine really shines though is the graphics.  The art in this game is absolutely stunning and it's amazing how well it runs even on older hardware.  It also makes use of nVidia PhysX for high quality physics simulation (nVidia hardware not required.)  The world and levels are very well designed and quite engrossing as well.\n\nThe only thing this game is missing is coop, but that was added for the sequel which is just as awesome.  Play them both!

If there are any people out there who have read my other reviews with any regularity, you know that I am not a fan of puzzle platformers. With early access and indie development being so accessible, the market is flooded with crappy 2D platformers and just the thought of them puts a sour taste in many peoples mouths.\n\nTrine enters the “2 1/2”D realm because the environment and models are all done in gorgeous 3D and it is only movement which is restricted to a flat plane. The gameplay actually surprised me because it focuses a good amount on combat, bringing in a sort of metroidvania feel without the exhaustive and often tedious backtracking. You can freely swap between one of three characters: a knight, thief and wizard. The knight is a go-to for combat while the thief covers mobility and the wizard... well he makes boxes. I found myself almost exclusively using the thief while only briefly swapping to the wizard to spawn in a box or plank. Meanwhile the knight sat around in limbo collecting dust between boss fights. It really felt like the characters were extremely balanced on paper but in practice the thief really is the main character, only needing the wizard to make some new platforms and the knight to smack around anything she can’t keep at bay with her bow.\n\nThe good parts of Trine are really good, and while I feel that the characters aren’t balanced quite right this doesn’t take away from the writing, animation and overall quality this game brings to the table.","March 9, 2015","true","15.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

On one hand, I feel like putting some thoughts together regarding Trine is well overdue, whilst on the other hand, it's actually fairly daunting. Trine has appealed to me in more ways than I expected when I first sat down to play it, and even now, on my third or fourth playthrough, I still find myself swept away by the game's grandeur.\n\nTrine's outstanding visual aesthetics and compelling soundtrack are just the tip of the iceberg as solid gameplay and well implemented puzzles expose the game's true beauty.\n\nFull review with screenshots here: http://twolofbees.com/cheesetalks/trine.php","December 2, 2011","true","13.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/recommended/35700/","misspauling","Cade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/","586 products in account","Trine is a game about three typical fantasy hero archetypes (the mage, the thief, and the knight) on a typical quest through typical locales to get (as typically) three artifacts. Along the way, you'll use typical weapons and fight typical enemies while solving typical puzzles and looking for typical secrets.\n\nDespite all this, Trine is fantastic. You play as one hero at a time, swapping on the fly, and they each play differently; the Thief has a grappling hook and a bow, the Knight is an excellent melee fighter and can lift and destroy heavy objects, and the Wizard can create and move platforms, crates, and the like.\n\nThe game itself is beautiful, mostly thanks to stunning art and level design, and the soundtrack is excellent, fitting the game thematically and doing its part to add an overall sense of exploration. The gameplay is top-notch, although the platforming can be a bit floaty at times.\n\nThe game is a decent length (6-8 hours or so) and never really overstayed its welcome, and finishes with a fantastic level that's much different from any previous one. Throughout the game, you'll level up your characters and find hidden items that you can equip to any of the three for stat and ability boosts.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with Trine and recommend it at almost any price, but I did have one gripe with it: the heroes are vastly varied, but unfortunately that applies to how fun they are, too. The Wizard is by far the least fun to play, although he's probably the most useful; the Knight I had the least amount of fun with, until I got a late-game upgrade that made him feel, at least, powerful; but I almost exclusively used the Thief, whose grappling hook and ranged weapon made her incredibly fun to play and almost made the other characters obsolete for platforming and most combat scenarios.\n\nThat, however, is only a personal problem and completely subjective. Other people might find the Wizard to be the most fun, given his versatility, or the Knight, since he can throw rocks and smash skeletons to pieces in an instant.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Trine to anyone who enjoys solid platformers with a tiny bit of puzzling, fantasy themes, or beautiful scenery.\n\nNine out of ten.","January 26, 2013","true","10.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

For starters, the graphics are pretty good. The puzzles on their own aren't necessarily the hardest thing to get by, however they're still very fun. The characters aren't necessarily the most well balanced, as there is a certain one of the 3 that can be pretty bad *cough the knight cough*.  The narrator fits the tone of the game quite well which also makes it fairly entertaining.\n\nThis game also has the very elusive Box Wizard! Yes, you heard it here first folks, there is a Box Wizard. He is a professional Boxer in a sense that he can summon boxes! He can also summon some other stuff, but who cares about that when you have freaking boxes?!?!\n\nThe story of the game is also pretty enjoyable, making it a great game to unwind to. So, if you want to adventure as a Thief, Knight, and a Box Wizard, the Trine series is perfect for you. If you're not sure if you want to get into this game, I'd still give it a go, you never know, you might enjoy crushing your enemies under some boxes.\n\nSide note, this game is so awesome that it thanked coffee in the end credits!","July 25, 2015","true","7.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

Rather than hack and slash, you can step on lesser enemies, swing yourself (by grappling hook) to crack them, or perform other stylish tricks to fight.\n\nMost of the puzzles can be solved by different characters with different methods. Well, let talk about the Wizard guy; he can create objects and throw them onto spikes, leting himself pass unharmed - which is pretty cool.\n\nTrine is one of the greatest games you can't miss on Steam, and you don't want to miss its soundtrack.","November 11, 2014","true","7.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerazull/recommended/35700/","nerazull","The Dirt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerazull/","69 products in account","Just finished Trine in the free-weekend.\n\nI wanted to play this game for a while, and I took advantage of this opportunity to finally try it out. I am not disappointed, but I'm not fully pleased either.\n\nTL;DR review = Beautiful looking game, impressive degree of immersion for the genre through graphics, sounds and writing. Gameplay mechanics are not terrible, but they are the weakest link in this game. Not a deal breaker though, game is worth a try.\n\nTL review:\n\nGameplay:\nI know quick-time events are not a necessity for side-scrolling platformers, but when you have a rich 3d environment and heavy physics, they become important. Case in point, the grapling hook from the Thief seems often buggy (often goes through stuff you can jump on, breaks with no clear reason, etc), staying on platform edges or jumping on them can be more tricky than it should, and creating platforms with the wizard can prove difficult if there's the slightest denivalation in the terrain (boxes start to roll, etc). Combat is pretty repetitive and non-interesting, you don't have a lot of moves/attacks, and enemies have an attack animation that doesn't really land with the effect.One more thing; this might be an intended mechanic, or because of time and/or development constraints was not implentend: moving/dropping non-attached stuff with your wizard. It kind of feels like moving an object in editing software; physics are mostly there for the move part, but the drop part is just like dropping from a fixed point with no velocity, no matter what.\n\nGraphics\nThis is where the game shines. It looks gorgeus. There's a heavy accent on colours and detail, a beautiful 3d environment with a fixed side-scrolling 2d camera. The style gives every setting the feeling of magic, especially the outdoor forest parts. It's also not extremely demanding, at least in the original version; I was able to run it with an acceptable framerate on an outdated low-end laptop, and it looked great. Enchanted Edition wasn't all that spec friendly :D.\n\nDesign\nStory - Not bad. It's sort of like a narrative that you knew as a child, a tale of heroes bound together, who overcome obstacles to reach individual goals, but find that their bond changes their perception, and seemingly work together for the greater good.\nSounds - The music in this game is great. It fits perfectly with the story/writing, and with the adequate graphics behind it, it's conveying a sense of immersion. The sound effects and voice acting aren't bad either, but it's the music that truly shines.\nLevels - The levels are not too difficult, ergo this game is not too difficult. You may find it troublesome to get some achievements, but all in all it's pretty balanced, at last until the last level, which seems to jump the volume of difficulty to 150% (from 100% obviously...idk, I had no better analogy...). Again, it's not THAT difficult, it's just that the game progresses really smoothly in difficulty, not really increasing or decreasing by much, and at the last one, BOOM, it's like you switched from normal to hard (this game doesn't have a difficulty option, btw).\n\nConclusion\nWell...what can I say, I enjoyed it, even though gameplay mechanics kind of frustrated me. I'll put some of that on my rig though, and considering I'm recommending this game, what I found problematic isn't that much of a problem.","October 23, 2014","true","9.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It has a bit of humour, and has personality that many games which cost five times as much would kill for. You can tell a lot of love went into this game.\n\nSADLY, it's really janky. The platforming mixed with physics can be really frustrating to play, not because it's difficult, but because it's not very accurate. This can lead to lots of "miscalcuated" jumps, and whatnot.\n\nBesides that, there's really not much variety to the game, and the core mechanics of switching between Wizard, Thief and Knight to battle and solve physics puzzles really don't cut it after a couple of hours.\n\nI'd be hard pushed to recommend this game at £6.99 unless you have a real itch for a physics-based puzzle/action/platformer.

It has very well lit levels, and yet all the levels are dark, with fire everywhere, and enemies intertwined on different platforms, with swings, slides, and other sorts of mechanical objects to manipulate, but the way the light plays on the surfaces makes it into pure videogame artistry. With a difficulty at higher levels that makes even me cringe at the repressed memories of what it takes to beat the last level of this game without dying, it could take a normal gamer over 80 hours to even get close to perfect completion. I only stood a chance because I almost beat in on 360 when it came out, investiong about 80 hours, but by comparision the 360 version looks too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to enjoy as purely as this. Before the Enchanted Edition I could run this game at max settings, not anymore. That's amazing. They really cranked the fidelity and extended the life of a game that didn't even need to be revived, I wish this would happen with more games.","July 31, 2014","true","38.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is like your grandfather telling you a bedtime story! The narrarator is great, his voice is so awesome. It looks pretty, especially on 11 (level) "Ruins of the perished". The combat is good to, the Knight is my favorite class. There is items you can find. Upgrades are pretty good, very linear. There is 3 parts to each type of upgrade like for instance the knights sword eventually is upgraded to a  flame sword . The imersion is so so because it does drag on eventually and let me explain. As you advance the levels keep on using alot of elements from earlier levels saying that the enemies do not change frequently as much as alot of other games. I would have like to see more enemies especially from a platformer game. It does get boring sometimes because the some of the levels look the same. The character interaction is only at the beginning of levels when they talk. I think it is worth your time and money so if you like platformers and medieval fantasy then this game is for you.","July 2, 2014","true","19.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Additionally, this excellent physics based puzzle game actually rewards multiple solutions and trial and error methods for solving its fantasy puzzles.

I installed it due to it's small file size and thought "Meh, let's see what this is like." I didn't get off it... It's a fantastic game with 3 characters that you can find different perk items for to maximise their abilities. It's also a great puzzle solving game as you have to use your initiative to navigate the missions. The wizard has awesome powers to conjur up platforms, boxes and bridges. The thief is great because she can reach high up places and the knight is just kickass for when you have a lot of enemies around you. I favoured the thief the most due to her ability to grapple onto any wooden surface and climb the grapple rope. Following her closely I favoured the wizard as he can get your other characters around very fast. I love the idea of having 3 characters merged into one interchangable character, makes the gameplay really smooth.This game took me 5 and a half hours to complete, and that was on medium. The last mission is pretty insane and very fast paced. It has a great immersive world and it can keep you occupied for ages. Great time killer as the missions aren't massively long but there are nifty little hide-aways that have experience vials and chests, that if you play with the intention to fully play a mission, can take you quite a while.\n\nFor a 2.5D game it is very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.\n\n\n8/10","March 27, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As far as platformers go this has actually been more fun for me, if of course less challenging, than Super Meat Boy which is one of the best platformers of all time. The colours, sound and voice acting are all so well created and put together that I struggle to find any flaws with the presentation and audio. The story is very simple as you would imagine so if you're looking for some sort of epic tale then this is probably not going to be first on your list. Controls are fluid although you cannot use a controller, something which I believe they fixed in the second edition to this series. I couldn't reccomend this game more to people who enjoy platformers or want to support good indie gaming or hell even people who just like looking at something pretty. Replay value is pretty high as there are tons of secrets and achievements to conquer as well as hard and very hard difficulty modes respectively.

So, here are my impressions.\nVisuals: This game is a real feast for the eyes. I find it redundant to describe it in detail, since it's overall beautiful.\nGameplay: The control interface is comfortable and is neither too simple, nor needlessly complicated. The interaction of the characters with their envoirment is on a highly satisfying level, be it objects or enemies. What surprised me in a pleasant way are the physics in the game, making the platforming and puzzles a fun and challenging experience. The combat is rather simple, but decently done for this type of game.\nSound: No objections, just like a cherry on top of the cake it rounds up an enjoyable game.\n\nSo far it sounds like this is a perfect game. But, it does have it flaws, mainly the sadistic difficulty of the final level. Be warned, this is one unforgiving level with literally no room for error. The reason why it is signifficantly harder than the rest of the game is that not only it punishes every big mistake with the need to restart the level, and that it is quite fast-paced compared to the other levels. Another point is the replay value. Once you've completed the game, that is all what the story can offer, it has no extra content, only higher difficulty. That hardly means the replay value is zero, on the contrary. Unless you replay it several times in rapid succession, you can always rediscover this games charms and try to complete every challenge it offers.\n\nThe verdict: 8/10\n","February 12, 2014","true","54.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Interesting little game though the challenges don't get too much more interesting. Figuring out how to get chests and experience bottles seems to be the most puzzling part and I felt I cruised through the rest. The constant respawn at the checkpoints is nice, but takes away from the challenge of playing on hardest difficulty. The last level and the secret level were both slightly more exciting with a up down scroller as opposed to the typical left to right, but I feel it could of been added earlier. The whole (running against the clock) near the end as well also could of been utilizes more as it added intensity to the gameplay.\n\nAlso, I feel there should of been more boss presence in the game. A couple LARGE minions that could be counted as 'mini bosses' perhaps, but nothing that really bosslike impacted me throughout the game once.\n\nI also have Trine 2 and look forward to playing it. I look forward to seeing how coop may differ from regular gameplay and what kind of advantages that would have. I would not rate this in my top games, and I DID get it on a sale for both Trine 1 and 2 on a 3 dollar deal... But I believe trine 1 is worth at least a 5 dollar purchase.\nFun but not OVERLY exciting. I played a couple levels at a time and had to put it down.\n\nI would rate the game a 6.5/10 and would recommend for a younger audience, or people just wanting to burn casual time. Still fun, but not overly EXCITING.","February 13, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I feel like I'm going to say a lot of the same as what you'll read in other magazines.\n\nIts beautiful... its thoughtfully designed... though I won't say its challenging. Its easy just like a lot of games of our current day. When you have been gaming since the 1980s and things like ghosts and goblins I don't think anything is as challenging.\n\nIt will keep your attention for some time as there are many different ways to get through the levels. It gives you options which is nice for this day and age. Its like a platformers deus ex when it comes to choice. Though generally you will find that the warrior is less played and that you spent most of your time either as the rogue or the wizard as they are the most playable. I feel like the warrior was just added in there so they could call the game trine.\n\nIt may sound like I'm bashing the game a little but in the end I enjoyed it a lot. Probably the most through the achievement challenges and trying to beat the last level without taking any damage.\n\nIf you buy it and you like platforming games you'll love it.","January 3, 2014","true","22.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Bought it on sale, decided to give it a crack and haven't looked back.\n\nStunning visuals, devious puzzles with an almost perfect learning curve make this game amazing. Essentially the game revolves around having three charactors, Thief, Warrior and Wizard who all have unique abilities. The Thief can shoot a bow, and use a grapple to swing around and over obstacles, the Warrior is your melee charactor, with sword, shield and hammer, which can be used to bash through certain obstacles, and the Wizard who can leveitate objects and create boxes and ramps. As the game progresses, some of the chests you find will equip you with loot that enhance existing abilities, and also allow you to use them in different ways. This is alongside a relatively basic levelling system, which allows you enhance your abilities also.\n\nSome of the puzzles will have you using all three charactors to solve.\n\nThe achievements blend well with the game, and will have you playing each level over over to find all the secrets and experience. Finding some of the secrets will leave you scratching your head, until ultimately leading to the AHA! moment when you finally work out how to get there/find it.\n\n9.5/10 for me and definately worth buying. The fact that it comes on sale for $1 relatively regularly means this game just needs to be your inventory no matter what.","January 1, 2014","true","26.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Wizard, who can create boxes and levitate things in the air. The Thief, who can shoot arrows and use her crabling hook. And The Knight, who's speciality is killing monsters and lifting heavy objects. Using these three different characters in puzzle solving and platforming player must make his way to several different gorgeus looking levels.\n\nBEDTIME STORIES\nGame's story in other hand, is kinda cliche. Three main character are by accident been connected to the magical artefact, Trine. By working together, they must find way to stop Undead army and find artefacts which could undo Trine's spell. Story won't seems like much first, but feels like it was rip off from bedtime storybook and sucks player into himself by it's charm and music.\n\nDIFFERENT KINDA PUZZLER\nTrine mixes in it's gameplay puzzle solving, platforming and hack 'n slash. Especially in puzzle solving game shines. Mixing all three characters player can find several different solutions in puzzles, but was those solved by own way, progressing feels satisfying. Game have couple problems which could be worth to mentioning. First, enemy waves have bad habit to continue even then, when player have had enough, and second, game don't have any kinda online co-op, which is shame, because this game almost sceam for the online co-op. Levels are full of secrets like exp-bottles and special items which give game small RPG-feeling.\n\nVERDICT:\nTrine is a beautiful and personal looking puzzle platformer with it's couple annoying parts and not having online co-op. I suggest everyone who have any kinda interest to puzzle games and/or platform games.\n7.9/10","December 22, 2013","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was quite sceptical how the some kind of fairy tail/rpg-ish setting would match a platformer. Silly me, cause it perfectly did and furthermore the setting should not remain the games only strength.\n\nAs you may have already read, you are not going to play not one, but three-in-one character(s) - leeding to some refreshing game mechanics. As such you follow a not particulary special yet beautifuly told story through several stages with more or less (but rather less) difficult puzzles. Though the difficulty of the game in general is all in all rather not as challenging as other platformers might be it never felt unsatisfying.\n\nAfter all and especially consindering the price (even when there is no on-going sale) you really can't do much wrong with this gem. Even if you're not the one for platformers I'm almost sure Trine's charm and artstyle will win you over.","February 28, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You can change characters on the fly just by pressing 1, 2 or 3.\n\nThe visuals are stunning and I was constantly just looking at the scenery. The sound is equally good, with fantastic music that suited each level. It's worth noting the sound effects were all great and of very high quality.\n\nThere are several different enemies and "bosses" throughout the game. However, the enemies lack variety and will constantly repeat over and over. I put bosses in quotes because they are actually quite easy. Maybe mini-bosses is a better term.\n\nTrine is a very forgiving game (played on the default difficulty). It's easy to pick up and play a level. It never gets very difficult and has a very generous checkpoint/revival system.\n\nThe story is as good as it can be for a game like this. There's not much too it, but it’s conveyed well to the player through a fantastic narrator.\n\nThe controls are ok. Sometimes I got frustrated with my character motion and jumping onto ledges. But it is a minor gripe.\n\nTo fix my framerate stutter\n+I ran an uncapped fps and left it to vsync to run at 60fps. This caused stuttering every couple of seconds. I fixed this by telling Trine in the options to run at a capped 60fps. Completely smooth after that\n\nFix input lag\n+Another easy fix. My mouse input lag was pretty bad. Trine has an option to reduce lag. You'll want to put a check mark in that box\n\n\nPros\n+Beautifully styled graphics.\n+Sound design is solid.\n+Overall platforming is fun.\n+Game rewards you (with experience) for exploring corners and trying to find the secret chests.\n+Smooth 60fps\n+Stable. Never crashed on my Windows 8.1 machine\n+Great narrator voice acting.\n+Fun puzzles and having to think how to progress further\n\nCons\n+Not much to the story.\n+At times I fought with the controls\n+Default difficulty could be a little more challenging\n+Only a few useful power-ups. A lot of them don't affect the characters much. (This may change when played on a harder difficulty)\n+Very few unique enemies.\n\nFinal score: 8/10\n\nI would absolutely recommend Trine. The regular price of $14.99 seems a little much. I would not pass this up if it goes on sale. I got the Trine collections for $2.49 during the 2014 Summer Sale.\n","February 14, 2015","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fun. It manages not to frustrate the hell out of you. Plus the lovely Thief has the voice of Isabela from Dragon Age 2. You can shoot skeletons, smash 'em, chop 'em or just drop something heavy onto them. The puzzles are not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like they are in some games and... wheee grappling hoooooooo...\n\nQuite frankly, the visuals are stunning. I'm normally not one to focus on graphics but Trine is really excellent. Which is good, because it's not one of the soulless, mass-produced turds that get released so much lately.\n\nThat could tempt you to think it's just the visuals. but no, as I said - while it depends on the player, I found the balance between combat, puzzles and platforming quite appealing. There are also things to pick up for all the completionists, so you might find yourself replaying Trine if you're that kind of a person.\n\nI guess my main gripe with the game could be that it doesn't really have big flaws. It's not frustrating, you might actually consider that one. I don't. The game isn't really particularly hard, except possibly finding all the hidden thingamajigs. While there's not much of variety in opponents, they're not exactly the main focus either and the levels actually show variety. Which is pretty good, as copy-pasting is a pretty nasty sin.\n\nTrine hits quite a few nice spots and it calls back to the nostalgia days of Super Mario, just without taking the wrong cues - instead of picking up the ugly graphics and frustration, it takes the spirit of platforming and adds a spin on it. And while it uses physics for its puzzles, it avoids the pitfalls of that fairly well, delivering quite consistent results to what you do. It also gives you freedom to approach a few places in different ways, which is good - but as my memory serves, that resulted in me mostly using the Thief and the Wizard, with the Knight just doing bugger all except freak accidents when he was actually needed.\n\nThe game is pretty good, if a little short. I'm a bit on the fence whether it's a good thing or not, but then again it does avoid the pitfall of stretching everything too far and lets you have some carefree fun in between things. It's not even particularly rough around the edges, so it's definitely worth checking out.","November 24, 2011","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You probably will not find very new elements in this game that havent been playable before. However even the game adds nothing new to the gaming world i was fascinated by the beautifully created scenaries. The story of the game is not very deep and you wont see cutscenes at all. The music is very atmospheric and a great addition to the scenary. The voices of the characters and narrator are suiting well and are available in different languages. (I played on German and English language settings.) Mostly i enjoyed the multiplayer mode where you can join or host a public or private game and team up with 2 other players. Its a nice way to get to know different people or have fun with your friends. You can plan a strategy to find your path and even different strategies might lead to success. The different abilities of the 3 charakters have their own strengths and weaknesses which you will get to find out very quickly. I purchased the game in a bundle package with Trine 2 for only 3,22 euros and gave it a try but even without the discount i have to say, Trine is definately worth its money.","March 16, 2015","true","27.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't remember buying it or even trading for it.\nToday I booted it up so I get some cards to sell and I figured I should at least play for an hour or so (the time it takes to get the cards.). After clicking "Start" I was instantly unable to quit the game. The graphics were amazing, the physics were amazing, the story was great. Heck, even the characters themselves were good. It's about a knight, a thief & a wizard being stuck together (Don't ask.) so you have to switch between the three and all of em have unique abilities. (Except the knight, he just kicks ♥♥♥ with his sword/hammer). It's mostly a puzzle game but it has some great fighting parts. There are also some RPG elements (leveling up your character & choosing skills etc.). I played it for 4 hours until I finally beat it.It is a great game and you should buy it and play it. Then buy it for your friends so they can play it. Then play together. (still have to try the multiplayer, hit me up if you want to play.) Right now, I'm off to play Trine 2.","March 19, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's also a small skill-tree to explore: each character has three skills, each of which can be upgraded twice.\n\nDuring your travels through the levels you may find various "secrets" (items). They will be automatically assigned to one of your characters, though you can always switch the inventories around.\n\nThe levels are pretty short and cleanly divided, so it's easy to ration your play time.\n\nFor someone looking for a challenge this might be too easy, as I started playing on hardest difficulty right away and don't really think it's all that hard (supposedly there are more enemies and they hit harder, but the puzzles stay the same). But then there's also the hardcore mode, which I have yet to try out.\n\nThe puzzles are pretty simple.\n\nI can recommend this to everyone who enjoys platformers and beautiful sceneries, adults and children (10+?*) alike.\n\n* there is no gore or anything and the game might also be okay for children younger than that, but I'd always rather be safe than sorry","May 6, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In theory each character has their strong points and should contribute to specific areas of the game... However in reality for the majority of the game you could pick which of the three you like the best and roll through levels with them. Compounding on this problem is the fact that the Knight character is mostly useless leaving you to use him to eat damage. The narrative is clever with good voice over work between levels but can't seem to figure out if it's trying to be humorous or quaint. The graphics are beautiful but many parts made me wish I had been able to walk into the back/foreground (like Bug 3D).\n\nIf you enjoy platformers or RPGs this will be worth checking out since it combines elements of both well.","February 1, 2011","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The platforming is one of a kind, find your own way through the levels, with every level and area available to be transformed and manipulated to your own play style, with whichever character your prefer the most. Although the story is quite dark, the world is being sucked of its magic and happiness, the developers have really gone out of their way to make this story fantasticly fun, and the comedy and witty banter between characters cuts through the doleful yet beautiful and comedic storyline.

It plays VERY well with a keyboard and mouse.  Haven't tried with a controller yet, but I imagine it handles just as well.  The responsiveness you need in a platformer is there, the puzzles are interesting enough to make you think, and its not bad looking either.\n\nGraphics warning: Turning on AA will send your framerates into the toilet.","October 6, 2014","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Such a great idea and also well implemented... what else can you ask for? This is one of those games that are kind of special to me, along with its sequel Trine 2.

I never really paid too much attention to the story of the game, but that's just because the game is so fun that I was always eager to get started. The gameplay mechanics are great, I love how each character does different things and serves a different role within the group. In fact, I'd recommend playing this game with your significant other/housecarl. This is one of those great co-op games, definitely perfect for a couple or maybe even some friends... so long as there are just 3 of you!\n\nIt is true that the game is not hard at all, with the exception of the last stages,  but even on easy it'll take you some time to find everything in the game and discover all its secrets.

Beautiful! The graphics in this game are trully outstanding. The setting takes place in a magical world, and visuals transport the player right into it.\nApart from this, the gameplay is very original, and although it takes a little while to get used to, once you get into the game it can be a true godsend :) I would class this game as a casual action / puzzle / platformer. It is an easy-to-play kind of game, during which you can just relax and enjoy the scenery. This may be a downside to those who enjoy a challenge (especially when it comes to enemies, as these don't really get any harder throughout the game), but overall it is an utterly enjoyable experience.\nThere is also a lot of storyline which is definitely worth following.","January 8","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Guys you have to give it a try, but please it is better to play it after trine 2, trust me , you ll more things to understand and love in the game!!\nso its an 8/10 from me","December 20, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Such a great idea and also well implemented... what else can you ask for? This is one of those games that are kind of special to me, along with its sequel Trine 2. Athough the game was launched in 2009, the developers updated the game not long ago with a lot of new stuff. I never really paid too much attention to the story of the game, but that's just because the game is so fun that I was always eager to get started. The gameplay mechanics are great, I love how each character does different things and serves a different role within the group. In fact, I'd recommend playing this game with your significant other/housecarl. This is one of those great co-op games, definitely perfect for a couple or maybe even some friends... so long as there are just 3 of you!\n\nIt is true that the game is not hard at all, with the exception of the last stages,  but even on easy it'll take you some time to find everything in the game and discover all its secrets. I just managed to get all the achievements and it took me about 15 hours, but I'd say the main game would take you about 6 or 7 hours. Definitely more if you replay some of the stages, or if you like to go treasure hunting like me!  Oh, and in case none of your friends have the game but you still want to collaborate with other people while playing, remember that Trine also has an online mode. Besides all this, the game is in a lot of different languages and the dubbing is also very good in all the versions I've heard so far. I'd mention its cons, but I simply don't see any. Don't think about it too much, just choose the knight, the thief or the wizard and find that elusive Trine before it's too late!","February 17, 2015","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Plenty of side scroller action. If you want to play through the story and enjoy the combat this game will not let you down. Id even recommend buying  the Trine bundle which comes with Trine 1 + Trine 2 complete. However I will say the gameplay mechanics are the same between the two with Trine 2 have more color to its graphics and having co-op. If you are a fan of side scrolling action, with a light touch of rpg elements this game will not let you down. It has controller support but I find keyboard + mouse to be much more enjoyable to use.\n\nBottom Line: Worth gtting if you want to play the story of the characters from their beginning.Now with its enhanced edition it comes with the Trine 2 graphics and co-op.","July 18, 2013","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not a 6 hour binge or a 12 hour marathon session, but just a wind-down and chill out session of zen gaming? Well if you need to be remended then I highly recommend Trine. This gorgeous plateformer delivers level after stunning level of puzzle-platform fun in a relatively short but action packed package. I played through with an xbox360 controller and was pleasantly reminded of the console platformers I grew up on.\n\nAll in all a game well worth your time and dollar.

I may go through the game again on enchanted to see what differences there are besides better graphics....and while I'm at it, I might as well go for 100% completion so that means getting the remaining achievements I haven't already got from running with the original....\n\nOooohhh, I don't know why I started this on Hard difficulty(but didn't change it because I don't like changing difficulty half way through a game so I stuck with it)....hahaha - guess I thought I could take the heat! Apparently not so died so many times! hahaha... Actually I probably won't bother with 100% achievement completion(But I will try to get as close to that though) as I just took a glance and one of them was completing it on the hardest difficulty, which would be the next level up from Hard as this is the 2nd hardest(unless there's harder - there's apparently hardcore mode mentioned in the descriiption of that achievement....).\n\nAnyways, it's a puzzle, platformer, action and adventure game. That's what the genres should be, but it was tagged as only action adventure... So you start the game when the three characters collide with each other and combined into one being(I can't remember the exact details on how this happened as I started the game a couple or so years ago but never finished it), they are the Thief, Knight and Wizard. Thief's a  woman and the other two are guys. So are set out to find the other two powers(I forgot what the other two were called - lol and just finished a several minutes ago! haha), you have Trine. After that, the three beings as one will seperate into themselves again.\n\nSo gameplay is you can do local coop, or coop on seperate PCs and can play each of three characters, or if you don't have people to play with you can solo it, like I did. When soloing, you can switch between the three to use their unique abilities and strengths to overcome obstacles in your way. I would imagine it would be more fun and quicker/easier if you had someone or two to play with and they control the other two characters... If you know platform type games like oldschool mario, then I don't need to explain any further as it's similar to that, with added puzzles. If not, then you basically jump and down - killing and or avoiding enemies, solving puzzles, and the screen sidescrolls for you automatically as you progress into the level.\n\nGraphics, yeah I thought the original Trine graphics was nice and pretty with everything maxed. Had average fps  of about 67-ish. The physic in this game, which uses nVidia's PhysX system, was awesome! Another one of those rare PhysX games.\n\nAudio, well I can say that it actually made full use of my 7.2 surround sound setup - surprised as it's a sidescroller platformer type game which I would have though stereo would be enough, but nope! The atmosphere and music was great! The voice overs were cool too. Sound effects were nice. I believe it must be thanks to the EAX checkbox I ticked....\n\nUm not sure what else to say...I liked it enough to give it a thumbs up, though some of the parts are fustration especially the timing bits and to add skeletons attacking you at the sametime that you have to avoid or and kill off....hah....the last level.....oh god......almost raged but got through it in the end! hahahaha Oh and once you've finished the game, you unlock a harder difficulty, Very Hard - which I'm not even gonna bother with(Hard was fustrating enough for me thanks!)...hahahaha...also there's a new level that unlocks which appears to be similar to the last level of the game.........................................................\n\nSo yeah....you like solving puzzles?

The game is in 2D which is not a problem and you have to travel from the point left to the right, while climing fighting monsters and solving puzzels.\n\nPros:\n-Great environement!\n-Unique Story\n-Smooth controls\n-Archer charater well balanced\n\nCons:\nWizard charater and Breserker (fighter) Charater not balanced at all.\nI was playing this game with some friend so one took the archer the other the wizard so I took the breserker and my charater is suppose to be the best fighter since it's hes speciality.\n\nMouvement: Because the breseker cannot jump as high while doing parkours and puzzels and hes really heavy so to get him around he needs assitance on each levels. (wizard need to move him around) And trust me there is no other way.\n\nCombat: Sure your sword can bash into the skeletons quite easily but the wizards can easily block them with hes cubs and kill them drop cubs on him. So in combat your not that useful since there is also the archer shooting arrows behind to aid.\n\nBoss Fight: You do not damange the bosses (mini bosses so far) so you just block and jump around and hope to live an other day while the wizard tries to block him with hes cubs and the archer to kill him.\n\nBreserker: This charater is pretty much useless and destroy some of the trio coop gameplay because when you play the wizard you do 70% of the work the archer does 29% and the bresker does the last 1% because all you do is try to jump but it fails so you wait to be moved by the wiz, in combat you try to help but they other can handel it and in boss your kinda just here to watch.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------Conclusion-------------------------------------\nGreat game but unbalanced charaters in a trio coop so if you end up with the wrong charater you will be watching the others play.

Great game for casual co-op as well.\n\nYou play a trio of heroes trapped in a single body by a mysterious magical artifact called the Trine. While your souls are bound, you can be any one of the three characters at any time: Wizard, Thief, or Knight. Your quest is to find out why you’re bound together and how to undo the “curse.”\n\nThe game is played with keyboard and mouse though other players can drop in using a game controller on the same computer. You progress mostly from left to right in a two dimensional plane with a lot of jumping and scrambling from one level to another. With a press of a button you can instantly switch between the three characters, each with their unique skills useful for fighting (knight) grappling (thief) or conjuring objects to use (wizard). Each of the characters has their own life bar so if they die you need to either make do with the other 2 characters or backtrack until you get to a checkpoint (a glowing sphere). You can backtrack as much as you want in this game, which is useful since there are a lot of collectibles to be found. The collectibles mainly come in the form of experience potions, and when you level up you can upgrade skills unique to each character class (for example increasing the number of objects the wizard can have conjured at any one time).\n\nPros:\n+Amazing graphics for a little indie game. The environments look 3D despite being a simple side scroller.\n+Free upgrade to the Enchanted Edition. The upgraded version uses the Trine 2 engine and got a large number of new Steam achievements.\n+Nice story with good narration. The narrator appears as an announcer in Dota 2 so you may recognize his voice.\n\nCons: Not much really, the game is awesome.\n\nThis is a great, cheap game that anyone can get into. If you didn’t get it for free sometime in the past you can probably see it in Humble Bundles occasionally. Play with friends and family!\n","March 7","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So when I was first introduced to “Trine”, I was all like: here are new “The Lost Vikings” (by Blizzard, 1992): three characters, each one with his strength and weaknesses complementing each other and solving little puzzles to complete levels.\n\n“Trine” is not, of course a copy of “Vikings”: it is more of an action, the puzzles are a bit easier, characters transform to each other, not being present on screen simultaneously (much like Silmarils’ “Metal Mutant” of 1991). Of course game looks much and much better, the world is designed beautifully,\n\nGame’s characters get experience from killing monsters and finding secrets, which can also contain unique items. Level-ups make them stronger in combat and platforming.\n\nSo if you are into mildly difficult puzzle-platformers with a bit of RPG elements, you should check this one out.","February 26, 2015","true","11.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It suffers from some difficulty issues, especially in the end, yet those can be easily forgiven when you get yourself lost in the immersive visuals.\n\nLong version:Indie platformers on PC are far from being rare, but seldom do we see a gem like Trine. The largest selling point of the game is the breathtaking visual style and carefully constructed, detail-rich levels. The backgrounds are just teeming with and movement, making you feel you are playing in a living 3D environment, even though the gameplay itself is limited to 2D.\n\nThe game itself is a very traditional platformer, where the levels require agility and a bit of resilience to get through. You also get three characters with distinctive abilities, but they all seem to lack personality. Although the original design suggests that all three are needed to clear the levels, in reality most stages are beatable by using mostly, or only the Thief. Despite this shortcoming, the level design is fun, and gathering all the (optional) experience can be a challenging, but not impossible task.\n\nThe only part where the game falls short– like most platformers– is the story, which really boils down to: “Evil wizard is evil, go kill.” Still, the narration is pleasant and the banter among the three reluctant heroes is entertaining enough to keep you interested in the simple plot line.\n\nYou can also switch to the Enchanted edition in the Betas tab, where the engine is replaced by the sequel’s, but even though I can run Trine 2 with no problems, the Enchanted edition suffered massive frame drops for me, so I can’t judge the upgrade.","September 10, 2014","true","13.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The art alone is worth buying this, but the game is actually really fun and well done also.\n\nAs for the art, it's not just the drawings/models/textures, but the animation is pure genius as well. Every moving thing in the game is done with absolute perfection, and even though it's sort of a "2d platformer" as for genre, everything is done in 3D with great precision. Just the way the warrior blocks with his shield clearly has sooo much time and thought put into perfecting the action. And everything else is done with just as much care.\n\nI don't have as much detail to say about them, but the music and sound effects are just as great as the visual effects, and clearly just as well-perfected.\n\nThe physics are absolutely perfect, again done with absolute precision and perfection, with almost real life precision and realism. I'm on I think the 5th level, and there isn't a *ton* of combat, but there's just enough and it's well done like everything else. The game is probably a bit more puzzle-platformer than action(so far.. and I should say there's plenty of platform jumping, swinging, and hand/eye coordination stuff.. you just aren't constantly fighting enemies the entire time too), but the puzzles are great.. not unrealistically impossible, but they require some thought and dexterity and they continue to get more challenging the further you go.\n\nIn every aspect, this is one of my most satisfying purchases. And by the way, if you try the demo and like the concept, but aren't sure if there's enough to it, you gain more abilities and everything gets SO much cooler as you get further in. The wizard can create more boxes and also platforms(and there's still 4 more ability slots I don't know what they do... that's 4 for EACH character, and I think 5 more for the thief), the warrior gets a charge ability(and 3 or 4 more I don't have yet) and you get various special items for even more abilities, customization, and bonuses.","April 23, 2014","true","7.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's a mix of all the genres I love: RPG, puzzle, platformer, exploration, and it also has some fighting. I've loved it so much I beat it twice in a row! I started playing the Original Game (OG), which was amazing, then I moved to Enchanted Edition (EE), which was even better (if you wanna play the game just once, go for EE, although playing both might be worth, since they still feel slightly like different games). I'll definitely play Trine 2 when I have the chance! (Note: I haven't tried playing it online, so I can't comment on that)\n\nPros:\nGreat balanced mix of different game genres\nBeautiful graphics\nAwesome BGM\nThree different interchangeable characters who are likeable and have their unique set of upgradable skills\n15+1 long and well-planned distinct levels with their own atmosphere and a lot of secrets to find\nCollectible equipment to further customize your characters\nReally addicting, it doesn't get old even if you're replaying a level\nNice voice acting, especially the narrator's\nEven though the game is old, the devs are still responsive at the forums, especially after EE, I guess\nCons:\nZoya, the Thief, is a bit overpowered\nI wish there was more to the story--I thought it was a bit shallow and I wanted more\nA bit easy for me, even on hard (haven't tried the OG-exclusive Very Hard Mode though)\n(OG ONLY!) Moving objects is slower than needed to be (a lot faster on EE)\n(OG ONLY!) Conjuring objects with the controller is a pain (improved on EE)\n(OG ONLY!)

The game focuses far too much on its combat system and too little on platforming or creative puzzle design. There's about three different types of enemies throughout the entire game, and they're all over the place in each level. So fighting them gets... really boring, really fast. Though the bats never stop being annoying. Ever. The puzzle design is mostly physics-based and can also be entirely broken, basically defeating the point. I have plenty of fun playing as the thief and doing neat platformery stuff, but that's fairly limited throughout the game... I kind of wish the game was based more around that mechanic than the combat or physics puzzles, really. But as it stands the game just felt like it dragged on forever to me despite not even having that massive of a play time to it overall. Not going to say it's outright terrible but it's not particularly impressive either.","April 12, 2014","false","15.6"," 35 of 69 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","35","69","0","3"

Damn, I love this game. Seriously. I want to hug it and kiss it, it's THAT good. The game is simple. You complete levels by solving the puzzles. And these puzzles are mostly solved using physics. Depending on the puzzle, you choose one of three characters (you can switch between them on the fly) to solve them. Along the way you battle enemies and collect orbs to level up. You can also find chests with items, so it also has an RPG element to it. A shame the game is over too soon, I really did not want it to end. So I had to replay it several times since then, which, of course, I didn't mind at all. Yes, this is a must have !\nBring on Trine 2 !!

You will be jumping around on said platforms quite a lot, but instead of having just one character, you have three, which you can change on the fly (unless one or more of them died) and also has his own set of skills.\nThe mage can conjure crates, planks and a floaty triangle thingies, the thief has a grappling hook and a bow and the knight is best suited for combat, but the thief is pretty much the best class, mostly because of her grappling hook, which you will most likely use extensively. It's also great to just circumvent the few "puzzles" you get in the game.\nHer bow is also a great weapon, even in close combat, unless you are overwhelmed by enemies.\n\nAnd now let's talk about those enemies, shall we?\nSkeletons. Tons of 'em. Not running around in the levels, no, they're spawning. Again and again. And that is nothing more than annoying and certainly not fun.\nSometimes I've felt like in Call of Duty, when you aren't moving forwards and enemies just keep spawning and spawning...\nYou will also encounter bats from time to time, which are also quite annoying, but at least they're not as common as those skeletons...\n\nAll in all a good and quite nice looking game with some annoyances here and there.","January 25, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is a pleasure to play simply to look at the environment. The detail to the characters, spells, enemies and background art is great. The voiceover of the characters is also very well done. All in all, the production and art, design elements are top notch.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are well done - but the areas that could have been improved are the RPG elements. The gear and skills for each character are fairly irrelevant. It doesn't seem to be much of a stretch to say you could ignore all the gear and all the skills and finish the game without notice that you didn't use anything. They are merely small accents to your character - which is cool - but feels like it could have been developed more to make each character even more specialized and the party dynamic more rich.  As it stood, I used the fighter all the time and only switched to the mage when I needed a box and the thief when I needed to swing (and maybe at least half the time I could just make boxes to achieve the same ends).  This wasn't enough to detract from the fun of the game - it just had me thinking there was a lot of character overlap or lack of puzzle diversity to properly utilize each character more.\n\nLeading to the "puzzles" - each level, each map was essentially always the same type. Eventually you get slightly different obstacles such as spinning boards, button pushing, but most of the time it was "jump, make a box, jump, make a box, (maybe swing)".  More diversity in this area would have enhanced things. Same with the story. I don't put much weight into the story, but it could have also been a lot more interesting than it ultimately turns out to me. It was only 10 hours in length for me, and I don't play very fast, so expect others could go through even faster.\n\n\nWith that said, it was still a very fun game. Recommended if on sale for sure.  I have bought the 2nd game (as a testament to the enjoyment of the first) and hope some of the things above are more fleshed out making it really what it could be. Then if things go well, onto the 3rd installment.","May 31, 2015","true","10.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I usually do not enjoy many platformer games, but in this case, I was pleasantly surprised. The visual aspect of the game is just gorgeous. The lighting really does make it feel 'enchanted' (enchanted edition). However, this alone is not what makes this game spectacular. It is the fact that there are so many creative ways in which you can complete puzzles and get about and around in the game that made me stick around. You play as 3 people whose souls are stuck in the Trine. If you play alone, then you have to switch out between the Wizard, the Thief, and the Warrior. Each character has different special abilities, giving you the opporunity to solve the same puzzles in so many different ways. As a gamer, it really makes you feel creative when you solve a difficult puzzle/climb a difficult part of a level in your own unique way. It is all up to you in how you will get around in the game, whether it be using the Thief's grappling hook or the wizard's floating platform (etc). This game is amazing because there are no limits and no standards to how you solve a puzzle/level. It is all up to your imagination :). This is definitely worth playing!","January 4, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Let this sink in for a moment, in this day and age of nickle&diming for worthless trinket pixel additions or triple A pricing for practically untouched re-releases. If you already own this, it is worth reinstalling and playing all over again; if you don't own it, it's worth every penny.\n\nAt the current sales price of 80-90% off for ALL Frozenbytes games (Trine 1&2 and Shadowgrounds), you really should just stop reading this and go buy whatever parts your collection is missing, right now. In fact, buy copies for all your friends. This company needs encouragement, and their success needs to be a bright beacon of enlightenment for games developers and publishers out there.\n\nThere's free demos to all their games if you're still doubting. Its unique experience is best understood through direct gameplay anyway. Get it, play it, then tell me again this isn't worth paying for.\n\nBtw, performance tip: if you use the enchanted version with an NVidia GPU, make sure to add the trine1_32bit.exe file to the NVidia control panel under Manage 3D Settings, otherwise even though it uses the same engine as Trine 2, you will get a lot worse performance. The enchanted executable is in a subdirectory of the main Trine game folder. Doing this with the free downloadable nvidiaInspector and adding to the predefined Trine 2 profile is probably the best way to take advantage of the optimizations for the updated engine.","July 25, 2014","true","35.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's not terribly hard unless you play it on the hardest difficulties, mostly due to offering infinite lives and copious checkpoints, but it always feels like a fun adventure and doesn't lack for challenge, even if you'll be able to respawn until you complete it eventually.\n\nPlus it's got an amusing sense of humor and a solid artstyle, and with the Enchanted Edition upgrade, online multiplayer for when you want to help (or screw over) your friends through the levels.

It is a pleasure to play simply to look at the environment. The detail to the characters, spells, enemies and background art is great. The voiceover of the characters is also very well done. All in all, the production and art, design elements are top notch.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are well done - but the areas that could have been improved are the RPG elements. The gear and skills for each character are fairly irrelevant. It doesn't seem to be much of a stretch to say you could ignore all the gear and all the skills and finish the game without notice that you didn't use anything. They are merely small accents to your character - which is cool - but feels like it could have been developed more to make each character even more specialized and the party dynamic more rich.  As it stood, I used the fighter all the time and only switched to the mage when I needed a box and the thief when I needed to swing (and maybe at least half the time I could just make boxes to achieve the same ends).  This wasn't enough to detract from the fun of the game - it just had me thinking there was a lot of character overlap or lack of puzzle diversity to properly utilize each character more.\n\nLeading to the "puzzles" - each level, each map was essentially always the same type. Eventually you get slightly different obstacles such as spinning boards, button pushing, but most of the time it was "jump, make a box, jump, make a box, (maybe swing)".  More diversity in this area would have enhanced things. Same with the story. I don't put much weight into the story, but it could have also been a lot more interesting than it ultimately turns out to me. It was only 10 hours in length for me, and I don't play very fast, so expect others could go through even faster.\n\n\nWith that said, it was still a very fun game. Recommended if on sale for sure.  I have bought the 2nd game (as a testament to the enjoyment of the first) and hope some of the things above are more fleshed out making it really what it could be. Then if things go well, onto the 3rd installment.","May 31, 2015","true","10.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Over-hyped game. Apparently Trine 2 is better.\n\nI did not expect being disappointed by a game with 'overwhelmingly positive' reviews.\n\nAm I the only one who noticed that there are only 4 types of enemies in the entire game? That the 1st and 2nd bosses are used several times throughout the game? That the game has no endboss despite being an action platformer? The ending is a complete joke. In addition, the tag 'puzzle' doesn't suit this game because the puzzles are either too easy or can be completely avoided in Singleplayer thanks to the thief's abilities.\n\nThis game is boring because there is an obvious lack of variety. The classes are also really unbalanced. As a consequence some are more fun (Thief) than others (Knight). The knight's gameplay is based on smashing the same button to kill ennemies. Amazing. Later on you get upgrades which allow you to insta-kill ennemies, but beware: you will need 2 buttons! Playing with the Thief or Wizard makes the fights at least a bit more entertaining.\n\nI won't deny that the graphics are great, that the music is nice, that the story is better than for typical platformers, but none of these elements can make up for the lack of gameplay variety.","April 11","false","13.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Gorgeous, colorful background/art design (it's a really great looking game). Not very difficult, but there are a few more tricky obstacles. You control one out of three, instantly switchable characters with different abilities to navigate the levels, manipulate it's objects, create your own or fight enemies. These three characters have some personality, but you don't get to know much of their backgrounds and they remain stereotypes mostly:\n\n- Charming, lady-lover wizard who conjures boxes, planks and platforms. Kills enemies with physics.\n- Mysterious, reserved thief who uses a grappling hook to pull and swing herself around. Kills enemies with bow.\n- Overweight knight and wannabe hero who likes food and drinking. Uses shield to avoid damage. Kills enemies with sword.\n\nThe story leaves to be desired. There is one, there is a narrator speaking before each level and the characters sometimes comment things too. But it's your generic good vs evil fantasy thing. There is a name-giving "Trine" artifact binding the souls of the three characters together. It sounded interesting first, but it's not worked out further, it's only a tool to give reason why these otherwise very different personalities come together for an adventure, and creates the outline of it.","March 29, 2014","true","17.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Trine has modability though, so this may help sway your decision if you are worried about getting enough bang for your buck.

If you are not so much into the dexterous manipulation of a character on moving platforms over pits of death (or exreme damage), then stay away from this game.","April 1, 2012","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And damn, it's fun! The combination of puzzles and action that force you to use the three different characters as effectively as you can keeps you entertained and on your toes. Sometimes the objective can be unclear and some solutions not obvious enough, but the humour, tons of collectibles and rewarding way to progress will make up for it. I'm almost done with the game and can't wait to get my hand on the sequel!\nPS: Who needs fireballs, anyway?","December 27, 2011","true","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The enchanted edition updates the visuals of an already delightful platformer. If you like platformers and like the look of the gameplay from trailers - you won't be disappointed by this game. It's not necessarily the most hardcore or involving affair - even on the max difficulties, and the narrative isn't terribly compelling, but it is pleasant - whimsical - and beautiful. A perfect game if you just need to relax and feel like you're in some fantasy world. The soundtrack is superb. Would give it two thumbs up if I could.","May 30, 2015","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'd've easily paid full price for this. This game is good to play for a few minutes or as long as you want and with the ability to Save the game and pick it off where you left off is a plus.\n\nPros:\nThe graphics are pretty good and the environments are very impressive.\nThe mehchanics in this game are easy to learn.\nEach level allows for many different ways in which it can be solved using each of the heroes abilities to make it happen, I favour the wizard.\nThe game loads very quickly so that you're ready to play in no time.\nThe abilities available in this game are simple and effective.Cons:\nThere are honestly no Cons I can think of at this time. This could change over time, of course.\nI also managed to buy Trine 2 when it was on sale around the same time and am already looking forward to playing it. Would certainly recommend this to people who enjoy simple side-scrollers without the pressure to get through an entire level in such a short time.","May 29, 2015","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I did it, and boy would I do it again.\n\nIf you want an atmospheric platformer with puzzle elements this is the game for you. Not only because the game is just something you should've played. It's also a bit different than your normal platformer. Because you can switch between 3 different characters while playing with a simple push on the button. A warrior, who is strong and fierce, a mage who can't cast a fireball, and a ninja-like archer.\n\n+ Character switching feels quick\n+ The level design is amazing\n+ The story is alright, but the narrating is done much better\n+ The various abilities keep the game fun\n+ Doesn't feel liniair\n\n- Terrible controller controls / Magician not playable\n\nI definitly recommend getting Trine.

This game has ANY negative reviews? Wtf?\n\nTrine. This is one of the most breathtaking, fantastic games I have seen in the past decade. It's just stunning. The graphics are incredible, the physics based stuff is all hugely entertaining, and I find obliterating skeletons to be immensely satisfying. It's just fun. I enjoyed going back to levels and redoing them time and again to find stuff I missed, because they were just that good. I play with mouse n keyboard, naturally, so I didn't really have any issues with my controls. I can't imagine trying to play Trine with a DS3 or Xbox controller.\n\nZoya is my favourite, naturally, Amadeus is my least favourite. Being a wizard is nice and all, but he really only exists to make boxes, for the most part. And you can end up making a -lot- of boxes. But, yeah. Pontius is okay too, and his hammer is AMAZING. It's awesome to see everything on the screen explode.\n\nI never really had any issues with the difficulty. It's fun enough just going through the game. The story is, when you really think about it, quite plain - essentially, skeletons appeared, and then three random heroes touched a thing called the Trine and became one in a way. But I still love it. It's just so quaint, and gives me a warm happy feeling inside. What's better than a story about knights in shining armor (and his thief companion, and the cowardly wizard guy who followed them about)?\n\nThis game has no real elongated cutscenes or anything. It's just a simple platformer. You jump around the level, and hopefully you're the thief and you abuse the hell out of your grappling hook. The grappling hook is in my opinion one of the best parts of this game. It's just way too much fun to swing about with.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing. It's just amazing. The tone of the game is perfectly in harmony with what you're seeing, and it always feels appropriate. Each level has it's own theme. I love it.\n\nAnd the last level... I loved it. It was extremely challenging the first time, but that's great! I actually felt challenged, properly, not just because the devs had a range of multipliers for enemy HP and damage (which the game has anyway, but I played on hard nonetheless) but also because on this last level, the 'AI' drops stuff in front of you as you're going up this tower. If you're not fast enough, the lava rising with you gets you. It took me several tries to beat the first time, but it's absolutely just a measure of skill, even now when I'm out of practice I bet I could go back and complete again, easy. It's just about learning.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough. Some people complained that the levels aren't varied enough, but honestly I disagree. You're not just wandering around a castle, there's quite a variety of beautiful areas to get through, and I feel like each level has it's own set of things that distinguishes it from the other levels, they really don't all feel the same to me at all. Would you say Super Mario isn't varied enough, because you just go from one end of the level to the other, platforming along the way? No, you wouldn't.\n\nIn short, Trine is an amazing game, especially at the price. It's on sale for as low as $1.50 so frequently you can set your watch by it. I think I remember this game being only $10 at one point, I don't really remember them raising it, but, hey, I'd pay $15 for it again if I knew beforehand how much enjoyment I would get from it.","November 5, 2015","true","11.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay is fast and fun, using the wizard to summon blocks to jump up to unreachable hights, then shooting skeletons with the theifs bow. The puzzles are difficult and will keep you interested, while trying to find the hidden xp bottles around the place.\nTrine is a very pretty game, beautiful even. The graphics are memorable and even if your not a big fan of platformers you can still get lots of enjoyment out of this game, mainly because of its well excecuted boss fights and interesting dialogue. For all ages, I would recommend this as a worthy pickup.\nHere is my overall rate:\nGraphics 8/10\nGameplay 8/10\nDialogue 7/10\nStory 6/10 (not mind blowing but interesting enough to keep me playing)\n\n9/10 would get crushed by my own blocks again.","November 7, 2015","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, "Rock 'n Roll Racing"?\n\nNo?  Where you alive back then?  If not, then you have a temporary excuse.  Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine.  If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of "The Lost Vikings", and play it through to the end.  If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of "The Lost Vikings" for your eighth birthday.  Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses.  Go.  When you're done playing through the game, come back.  I'll be waiting.\n\nIf you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person.  That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance.  You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.\n\nAlright.  Done playing through "The Lost Vikings"?  "Trine" is a lot like that.  Slightly different abilities for your "Vikings", and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea.  Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).\n\nWhat, never heard of worm-jumping?  Were you alive/competent in 1997?  See the above paragraphs, and replace "The Lost Vikings" with "Worms 2".

I can't say too much about the story since I just couldn't get into it. The 'leveling' seems a bit slapped on and doesn't really add too much since you're effectively railroaded into it anyway; same could be said about the inventory. These things and the occasional focus on fighting things just don't seem to fit very well. Some skellie killing is all well and good, throwing a boss into a puzzle room is much fun, but the times when you're screen locked into fighting 1by1 spawning is weird for this kind of game.\n\nAs for the co-op... Honestly it's way easier to do yourself. And the level doesn't change with multiple people so it's completely unnecessary to have the other person. If anything you're just slowing each other down.

While I want to give this game my whole-hearted recommendation, I had to hesitate because I found that the game failed in the story-telling department.

There are very few indie games out there that has this much color and graphical fidelity. Trine is extremely pleasing to the eyes and it perfected the fairy tale graphical style. While the graphic is magnificent, the 2D plat-forming gameplay is just average. There are virtually zero depth in puzzles and progression, basically a child can play this game and get to the end without fail.

The main gameplay point, one where you play one of three characters which you can swap between seamlessly makes for some really cool basic puzzling and combat.\n3. The story itself is somewhat generic fantasy but that's something that really appeals to me and pulls this off in a manner that is not too sterotypical to the point where it becomes annoying but is just cliched enough that you recognize and enjoy it.\n\nA great platformer, the high point being it's stunning visuals and rope-swinging thief character.","April 13, 2013","true","11.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Meaning, for example, that if the char is on the edge of a platform since few seconds, he/she may fall after a little while without pushing any button; other example is: given a distance between the point where you're at and the ledge where you have to grab on, one time he/she will grab the ledge and another time he/she wouldn't. Making you fall on an acid pit or spikes, of course.\nThe graphis are pretty rich but the surroundings are not clear and defined.

The visuals are charming - the characters and the background have a distinctive, beautiful fantasy-world feel to them. The controls are tight - you will have a lot of fun with all 3 of your characters, playing them in 3 different ways to jump around the levels and defeat the baddies.\n\nThe main downsides of this game are two. First of all, it's just not challenging. I'm not sure if this game was trying to be a puzzle platformer but it falls down on both the puzzling and the platforming. In terms of puzzles, nothing really confuses you for more than a few breaths. Exploiting the physics of the game to move around the levels is usually how it's done but gets old after awhile. The story is also lacking. It's entirely non-descript. This may be a non-issue for some, especially given the short length of the game, but along with the lack of challenge this meant it got boring by the end of my four hour playtime.\n\nIf you're particularly intrigued by the concept of this game or you find a great sale, go for it! It's a fun little romp. If you're looking for a bit more depth, look elsewhere!","October 24, 2015","false","5.0"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

One after another kept saying it is good.\nBut it's so far from the truth.\nWhen one delves deeper into the depths of Trine one might not come back the same as he once was.\nTrine shares a common trait with certain platformers, for instance you must collect certain items each level to get that perfect score. Yet most levels require several playthroughs before you can finish them 100%, not that it's bad.\n\nBut when you come to a certain point where you needed to jump slightly instead of running off of it, and that wasn't the first time you forgot it either, comes frustration. And as I was playing things just kept adding up.\n\nThe story was pure horribleness, the attempt at humour was even worse, the wizard is the most annoying character in the game, once the thief is dead you might as well restart the level seeing as most levels requires her to finish.\nThe items are terrible, I can't remember if I ever found something for the wizard, not that I would care to either but there's a certain principle of things.\n\nThe enemies are pure moronic, they will either try to kill you with a wall between you and him. Or just casually walk off a cliff trying to get to you. Bats are only there to rid you of your health, a lazy enemy at best.\n\nThis game is stupid, I don't know why nor would I be able to comprehend anyone that likes this.\nMy joy was killed at the beginning of the game, and the horrors of 2player mode (control-wise) ensured me that I would never be playing this again.\n\nAlso, why does this game have or even need 2 sequels, I can think of at least several things that could've benefited from all the money and time that went into their creation. Like planting a tree or stepping on my balls so I would've been midly distracted when hearing such news.","January 16","false","8.1"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","7","0","0"

The puzzles get slightly harder, but its fairly even through out the levels.  Then all of a sudden at the end, the puzzles get much harder, and there are unreasonable amounts of enemies.  They just spawn, and spawn, and spawn, and you have to wait until they are done before you can complete the puzzle.  Then the last level shoots the difficulty all the way up to completely insane.  I was playing medium difficulty, and after getting killed 6 times after spending 5 minutes climbing, I went down to easy mode, which didn't make much difference.  The last level would make a nun curse out loud.\n\nOther than the ridiculous difficulty ramp, the story is bland and tacked on between the levels.  The enemies are all basically the same skeleton, and are plain and boring.  You are always forced to fight them as they will aggressively chase after you, pulling off insane manoeuvres like leaping 40 feet in the air to grab the ledge you are on.\n\nOverall, the game was OK but did not live up to the hype.

Repetitive gameplay, very little challenge unless you go for the extra experience and hidden areas. Oversaturated graphics look pretty cool but can be distracting at times. Nice music. Story is generic and skeletal at best but doesn't waste your time or detract from the gameplay, and the voice acting is pretty good. Occasionally it is difficult to tell the environment apart from the background, and sometimes parts of the level obstruct the camera.\n\nOverall it's not bad; I did play it through to the end. Still, it's nothing too special, even from an indie developer. On a numeric scale I'd rate it a 3/5.","July 11, 2014","false","9.7"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","28","5","18","0","0"

I did.\n\nAnyway, this game starts out with the neat idea of a puzzle/adventure game - which seemed to impress a lot of people when it came out - only to stop being creative halfway through and produce a game with the audacity of a day-old gumwad. Stop playing halfway through - I guarantee you did all the enjoyable parts already, the Knight's hammer isn't even that great, and the last level is one of those pseudo-timed lava-slowly-rising dealies. The controls turn out to be too sluggish and most obstacles are better solved with methods that feel like cheating, so the whole experience sort of just falls apart and feels half lazy and half frustratingly vindictive. Sliding off ♥♥♥♥ into hazards that were way off screen happens way too often in the late-game.\n\nAlso the characters are idiotic tropes, the narration is predictable, cheesy, pointless, and even kind of wrong in a couple points ("and then they heard his voice" isn't really accurate if the only things he does is laugh), and the payoff at the end is just so embarassingly bad it should've been replaced with a big "YOU WON" sign. The graphical design is pretty nice in a lot of parts and only confuses you over what's actually something you can step on in a few parts, so that's, uh, positive. A big negative is that a lot of the music sounds like it belongs in a Geico commercial or a bad fantasy parody movie - or one of those off-budget CG movies that try to copy Dreamwork's titles to cash in on grandmas who want to buy their grandchildren a fun DVD but weren't paying enough attention to the ads. Although Netflix is picking up a lot of them now so I guess the irony factor is working out for them.\n\nAnyway, if you bought this on Humble Bundle for however close to almost free you wanted to get, fine, whatever, but probably save yourself the hassle and stop after three levels.\n\nIf you bought it when it came out - thanks to your inflation of its popularity, they made a Trine 2, which I bought before actually playing through this tasteless ♥♥♥♥♥ack.

It really doesn't get much more trivial than this for a platformer, even Super Mario Bros. has more variety and little unnecessary filler.\n\nThe AI is dumb and will constantly fall off ledges and jump back up, only to fall off again. Weapons are slow and inaccurate, the wizard's conjuration ability requires such precision that it becomes useless in any combat situation. Also, why can't I jump and fire arrows or use my conjuration spells in the air? Stupid limitations.\n\nThe premise is interesting, the Trine mechanics are innovative, albeit contrived. The story is lacklustre. The narration during the loading screens is so slow and fragmented that I can't be bothered waiting to hear what's being told.\n\nThe levels are all too similar in layout and lack inspiration. The puzzle mechanics aren't challenging and are too predictable, they seem to be the only reason for the physics engine to exist in the first place.\n\nCo-op is almost unplayable and seemed tacked on "just because" as both players control one of three characters, but only have access to two of the characters at a time, which slows down gameplay considerably. It also doesn't make sense in context with the Trine itself. The option for three player co-op is there but I'm not certain many people would be able to take advantage of this on PC.","February 6, 2013","false","14.7"," 13 of 38 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","13","38","0","0"

However, in solo, that concept break down because of Zoya. Zoya has a grappling hook, that allows her to bypass most puzzles, and zoom accross levels. It's fun to stay in the air for a long time, but that doesn't provide for interesting challenges. Also, since she is also good in combat, she makes Pontius optional, and since Amadeus is so limited, he too is almost optional.\n\nThe game is obviously meant to be played in coop, so that each character's weaknesses must be compensated by the other's strenghts. You wouldn't be able to zoom accross the level with Zoya, because you would have to find way for Pontius and Amadeus to cross the obstacles. However, I haven't had an opportunity to try that, so i can't tell you if that actually works.\n\nHowever, regardless of whether you liked this game, I do recommend Trine 2, which is awesome in all regards.","December 31, 2013","false","16.3"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","2"

Many others would disagree, but this is the biggest point of the game to me. I got severely bored only after 1 hour of play and I was quite happy to get done with the game.

There is quite a mess on screen and it's sometimes hard to tell a bonus pickup from an enemy attack.\n\nThe controls - which should be the most important thing for a platformers - don't allow for enough precision and feel sloppy, which will often trigger misses. Not that it matters because the game is too easy anyway.\n\nAll the levels feel exactly the same, beyond level 1 there is hardly any new mechanics, from there it's just grinding your way through.\n\nThe fixed camera placement is annoying. You know objects are there but the camera won't budge or allow you to place objects outside the current field of vision.\n\nThere are just 2 bosses, they're not epic, just merely a slightly tougher foe, and they come back several times in later levels.\n\nNot much variety in enemies either, it's just the same skeletons from the beginning to the end.\n\nAll in all, this is just like playing the same level 15 times over again, with a different backdrop.\n\nI can appreciate some may be drawn by the medieval fantasy storytelling or by the luxurious backdrops. The graphics got overhauled recently with the enchanted edition and it's quite superb.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GFJmember/recommended/35700/","GFJmember","GFJ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GFJmember/","771 products in account","Mediocre.\n\nThis game seems to suffer from an identity crisis? What is it? Quoting the manual, "Trine is a great\nplatformer game for the modern era infused with action and puzzle elements"\n\nWell, I'm afraid it doesn't do any of these particularly well.\n\nThe jumping is sloppy, and you never really feel confident in landing in any particular spot. The game's physics are sloppy. Very frequently I found myself trying to "brute force" my way through jumps, especially when landing on platforms which are affected by the mass upon them (such as beams which pivot around their centre).\n\nThe puzzles are based on the physics engine, and quite often involve using the Wizard to move/create blocks and planks to get somewhere. However, this is often sloppy. It feels more like you're 'guiding' blocks around, careful not to knock down any towers you have built to get anywhere, as the thing you are dragging rotates unpredictably, rather than firmly dragging them around. I suppose it fits thematically, as it is telekenesis, but from a gameplay point of view, the player doesn't feel in control. Furthermore, it usually takes a few tries to create what you want, particularly with the square blocks or triangular floating platforms (which rotate and are very unstable)\n\nCombat is plain awful. There are four main enemy types in the game, and they're all skeletons with varying abilities. You'll be seeing them throughout the whole game. What's worse is that they just keep spawning. One can spend several minutes just whacking them, as more keep spawning in, with no indication on how long until they stop spawning. You don't have a very varied move set either. It's either hold up your shield and wait for an opening with the knight, shoot an arrow at them with the theif (who cannot fire in mid-air) or hit them with a heavy object, usually with the wizard (who can't move when creating objects/using telekenesis).\n\nEnemy AI is also poor, trying to scramble over ledges, waves of monsters continually walking into a situation where they crush themselves. I admit, I played this on easy, but as far as I'm aware it only changes damage given and taken, rather than gameplay or AI.\n\nSo, to give some positives, the environments are very detailed, music is fine, dialogue has some witty moments, even if the story is unmemorable.","June 14, 2014","false","9.2"," 3 of 17 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","3","17","0","0"

It's hard to not play it alone as you need to switch characters quickly. And an evil guy is conjuring items like boxes and planks right in your face. So three bad things you never got trained in all the levels before.

Due to this, they have to solve the logic problems in their journey together in order to get past traps they won't be able to solve separately.\n\nThe gameplay is really beautiful and reminds to the fairy tales of Grimm.

That would require you mainly to go back through the levels to collect everything (treasure, etc.) you missed the first time around.  I'd imagine that could take roughly another 5-10 hours to do all of that, depending on how well you did completing the levels the first time through.\n\nGood game was good.  If you're into medieval platformers with good graphics, this game may be for you.  You take control of a knight, thief, and wizard.  Each has their own abilities and you can alternate between each character at any time to get through certain parts of the levels.  The knight is mainly good for fighting close range.  The thief fights well from afar with arrows and can use a grappling hook of sorts to grapple and swing to areas.  The wizard is able to conjure blocks, platforms, and bridges to get through the levels...which comes in real handy and lessens frustration that you might get from other platformers since the wizard can just cast a bridge the size of your choosing to cross two platforms without fear of falling and dying.\n\nThe music I'd describe as easy listening medieval.\n\nGraphics are colorful and nice.  No complaints.\n\nThe only complaint I would have if I had to get nit-picky would be that sometimes your momentum when jumping onto a platform from below may make you lose your footing by making you slide a bit and falling.  I usually used the thief when jumping around so I could just grapple if I fell.","February 4, 2015","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't think I've been so gleefully surprised by a single game as I have by this one in a long time, if ever.\n\nThe game is a true old fashion puzzle-platformer where the player controls 3 characters; a Wizard who can create platforms and boxes for mana, a Thief who can swing about and attack with a bow, and a Knight who bests his allies at combat. While you only control one at a time, you can switch between the 3 at will using 1-2-3 respectively, and you'll need to do so constantly to overcome the challenges the game throws at you.\n\nIf you're a fan of platformers, you should have this game already.

But that doesn't do the game justive on just how much -better- that makes a game like this. You still have to manage three seperate health bars, but the ability to on the fly switch and keep the other two members of the Trine safe really makes this whole concept go. Not to mention of course the  abilities of the Trine making the puzzle platforming an enjoyable cerebral exercise that isn't a strain to complete in the simple functionality sense but in the actual solving as a puzzle should be. As impressive as it can be, one doesn't solve a rubix cube with their feet, and one shouldn't play a game with poor mechanics and controls.

The AI can get stuck, making them easy targets for your thief and her bow. Overall, except for bosses, the enemies pose no real threat compared to falling into a spike pit.\n- The physics can get frustrating. Stacking boxes or getting platforms rotated properly can be a pain sometimes.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n- Certainly worth the couple dollar asking price in a sale. I wouldn't pay full price for this title, but given what it goes for every Steam sale, a real bargain. It also is appealing as something that can be played in short spurts and still be enjoyed, which is about all I have time for these days.","January 10, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This makes for some unique puzzle challenges as each has particular strengths/weaknesses and different ways to solve similar problems and some that only they can deal with.","July 10, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has splended graphics, a funny story, and really cool gameplay.\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\n\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nIt has superb graphics, especially for a platformer. Every nook and cranny of every part of every level was a sight to see.\n\nStory: 8/10\nIts story was really neat. It's silly and all, but still fun to watch and learn about.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nMost of its gameplay mechanics were absolutely fun. Anything and everything had physics, which made combat really fun. The biggest flaw of its gameplay was the SOMETIMES horrendous spawning. There were several times where I died, waited a few seconds, and respawned only to instantly die again (I played on the hardest difficulty). Other than that, the gameplay was incredibly fun.","July 11, 2014","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While there's a bit of room for improvement (that's where Trine 2 comes in), Trine has aged very well and has now been made even better with the new upgraded Enchanted Edition that adds local and online co-op, refreshed graphics and visuals, and a few other enhancements.\n\nIf only every game developer cared about their fans and customers as much as Frozenbyte, we'd have a much better gaming community and industry.","August 1, 2014","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
