Aside from 7 years bad luck for breaking one, they also are believed to be portals, gateways to the soul, a tool for visions and much more. RETSNOM gives you the power of mirrors in a clever and twisted Puzzle/Platformer. You can bend and warp your surroundings to your will as you make your forward in a strange laboratory full of zombies. What makes RETSNOM so enjoyable is the key to solving puzzles lies in your ability to think outside the box. This game has more then one way to skin a cat and this is what I absolutely loved about it. What enables this trial and error of imagination is the games amazing level design. Each level adds a new challenge and makes you think of a new way of doing things. This especially becomes more true as you move deeper into the game as platforms begin moving not only from left to right, but up to down, and can disappear all together. Other areas of the game shine, such as the soundtrack which is purely instrumental and builds on the somber but thoughtful story of the game. The game revolves around one mans quest to cure his daughter of the zombie virus and he won't stop at nothing and will kill anyone who gets in his way. While zombies are over done, the tone of the story reminds me of strange and classic sci-fi story from the early 50-60s. Involving time, space, and consequences of ones actions. RETSNOM is a very underrated game and really deserves your attention. There are times that can get frustrating and occasional bugs but each level is more or less 2-8 minutes long. So repeating content isn't that big a deal. So if you are in the market for a great soundtrack, amazing level design and an intriguing story. Get this game. Plus its a good price!\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/Z_DtzLPawGo\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","November 1, 2015","true","2.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

I wanted to get another early impression out because it seems like not many people are buying at this point and are perhaps waiting for some reviews to show first.\n\nSo, Voila!\n\nPROS:\n- Mind-Bendingly Challenging!  No really, your head will hurt -- dull aches all around.\n- Presentation is neat and simple.\n- The Story of a father looking for his daighter is enough to get you hooked and to motivate you ahead.\n- Really interesting Puzzle mechanics with seemingly multiple ways to solve them.  What I mean is, there is a lot of room for the random element and I would venture it would be sometimes impossible to design these puzzles for one solution only.  It is a really cool system.\n- Pixel-Art is minimalistic and GREAT as ALWAYS.\n- Music is good and melancholy.\n\nCONS:\n- As of right now, I can't really fult it for anything other than being SUPREMELY FRUSTRATING.  But that can either be a PRO or a CON depending on who you are.  The game definitively needs to be approached by one having the right/relaxed mood and mindset.\n\nThere is a bit of a Combat Mechanic and I am interested to see where that will go, - if anywhere - but insofar it serves as a nice break-up between puzzle solving.  Who doesn't like Machine-Gunning some Zombies?  The enemies can also be killed inside of walls that you move and the effect is rather satisfying.\n\nOverall I would say jump in if the video looks even remotely interesting to you.  Just make sure you are relaxed first!\n\nBEST OF ALL:  When you get stuck and cannot progress, there is literally a key to press where your guy bends down and bashes his own skull into the ground again and again until there is nothing left but pulp, chunks and pooling blood, LOL!","July 23, 2015","true","1.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","10","10","2","0"

You change levels in real time, solve puzzles, proud of yourself being smarty pants. On paper. But a bunch of  Level-design is far from perfect. You can not rebind buttons. Gloomy colours make eyes bleeding (Yes, you can make a great game with single colours - look at brilliant VVVVVV. But this game's greyness is just ugly), what makes all this swapping absolutly unintuitive and easy to lost any idea wtf you just tryed to achieve. How shalI I say it, that game just has a lack of individual style. And one of the most annoyng thing - if you push the mirroring button and change your mind, you can't cancel it,  have to wait until that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking bricks will snap into their place and push damn button again and again. Considering that all game is based on this mechanics, it's annoying as hell.\n\nI read all of this positive reviews and now feel some disappointment. It's like sort of prototype, not the final product. This game is not bad, no way, it may be frustrating a lot, but still fun. So much potential and mirroring levels is really, really cool, awesome and original idea, i like it. I just can't recommend it in this condition (and it's a pity for me). Good news: developer still works on it and works actively.\n\nSo get me right, I don't regret buying it. Indie games need our support, so if you're fan of 2D-platformers (just like me) and experimental games with original ideas, then please, please give this game a chance.\n\nWould like to see his next work.\n\n\n\nUPD.: after tough thoughs i finally changed my mind and show my thumbs up. The game is far from perfect, but I'm ready to forgive this in condition of future patches.","July 27, 2015","true","4.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","1"

The level’s blocks can be distinguished from the background easily and even with the limited amount of animation possibilities, the flying tie while running adds just the right amount of flavour into the mixture.\nSound The sound design, especially the music most of all, manages on top of the aesthetics to instil uncertainty into the player’s consciousness. All of it leads to a form of unknowing suspense, a tense atmosphere in a somewhat slow paced puzzle game. Very intriguing indeed.\nGameplayThe first world starts you off with a basic mirroring mechanic, allowing you to copy blocks from left to right and vice versa. The puzzling starts of easy enough, however soon thereafter, I found myself experimenting rather than trying to specifically look for a targeted solution, as getting into the mind set of mirroring blocks, especially multiple times in order to find the perfect pathway ended up being far too complicated for my puny human mind. My way of approaching the puzzles did not impair any of the fun that was to be had though. I feel RETSNOM is at its strongest when it allows you to experiment and play with certain elements of its mechanics - not instantly leading to your demise or a forced restart. Sadly, this happens more than quite a few times. Especially in world 2, where the mirrored blocks disappear after a few seconds, timing becomes essential.\nProblems?The problems that arise when timing elements are combined into puzzle games, especially in either slower paced ones, or when combined with imperfect controls have been discussed time and time again. In RETSNOM, we are dealing with both of these problems, the latter one being the more important one though. The platforming itself, is NOT satisfying in RETSNOM. Combining this with the necessity of timed jumping and mirroring, sometimes even to an extreme degree, as shown by the climbing level in the background, nearly made me drop the game altogether. My educated guess is, that SOMI, the game’s developer, is really good game design itself, while lacking experience in level design though. The underlying mechanics of RETSNOM, the mirroring left and right, or up and down with the play of gravity, or the possibility to break mirrors in the last world and completely change and alter levels to the player’s desire is just shy of mind blowing. Nonetheless, I felt the game did not utilise its full puzzle potential and instead forcing weak platforming upon the players.\nVERDICTTo sum it all up, RETSNOM is a really creative puzzle platformer with a suspended and tense atmosphere. Sadly, the game misses out on some puzzling potential and trades it for subpar platforming from time to time depending on the level. If some levels where skippable, let’s say similarly to Super Meat Boy, I would personally have enjoyed my time more. Nonetheless, for just five Euros, RETSNOM is surely worth a grab for all puzzle platformer fans out there, especially if you like experimenting with very interesting game mechanics.\n\nNOTE: The game at least for me sometimes jumped between 30fps and 60fps for no reason and made the whole platforming even wonkier. Be aware.","August 23, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It is atmospheric and the recent update has only improved it. My only criticism was the wording of some phrases, but the update entirely cleaned up those issues. The pixel art style works really well and the animation of the protagonists tie adds just enough movement to give the visuals balance. It is actually kind of pretty in its own way. The game is very easy to appreciate and honetly under priced. The puzzles can be very difficult, but it is fun just to play around with the different game mechanics and experiment if you get stuck. The story is pretty cool too, the idea that a father would do anything to save his daughter even if the whole world has to suffer, I really like it.
