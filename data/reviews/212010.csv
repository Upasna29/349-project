I've clocked just over 7 hours and I've spent at least 3 of them mining and doing freelancer missions. The campaign itself is somewhere between 2 and 3 hours at best.\n\n-You don't get any advanced ships or weaponry during the campaign. All of the rewards from the story missions combine to about 100k which is the price of a single high end piece of equipment. Top of the line ships meanwhile cost upwards of 2 million. Thus you'll spend most if not all of the story flying a starter ship or one marginally better and if you want the end-game stuff, you'll have a lot of grinding to do.\n\n-While we're on the subject of the story, it's quite mundane. Without spoiling too much, it boils down to some gibberish-speaking aliens popping up all over the universe and stealing cargo and we have to stop them. Who are they, why are they doing this, is there more to this? Who cares, just shoot them.\n\n-The universe is underdeveloped. There are 4 different factions but I only noticed that when one of them started shooting me because I got friendly with their enemies. Who are they and why are they fighting is a mystery. Naturally, you can't affect the wars (which incidentally would've made for a much better campaign than what we got)\n\n-The combat. It feels like a poor man's Freelancer combat and that game is what... 10, 15 years old? I think it suffers from being developed for mobile devices.\n\n-Lack of support. Apparently the developers were very surprised (and quite unpleasantly so) by the fact that PC players didn't throw twenties at them for the 2 hour experience and they've decided to essentially take their ball and go home to the iOS crowd that has more money than brains. As a result this is all we're going to get. No patches, no DLC, no modding support, nothing.\n\n-The developers themselves. Looking over a few of their replies to their customers, reveals them to be quite arrogant and obnoxious.\n\n-The price. Frankly, the game is overpriced for what it is. If they had bundled the DLC with it, MAYBE it would be worth 20 bucks. As it stands, it most certainly isn't.\n\nIn conclusion, while the game has it's moments, I can't recommend it at it's current price. If you can get it on sale 70% + off, go for it. Otherwise, stay away","September 10, 2015","false","9.1"," 314 of 353 people (89%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","89","314","353","21","14"

The graphics are good, combat is okay, and there's a fair variety of missions. I cannot recommend it, however, because the game was functionally abandoned by its creator. GOF2 started as a tablet game, and like many such games, the best and most interesting parts are available as DLC. But Fishlabs only ported the core game to Windows, and they've made it crystal clear that nothing more is forthcoming because the Windows port "didn't make enough money" to bother supporting any further. For what I paid, I assumed that content was already included, and after finding out that it's not only not included, but it will *never* be available, I feel ripped off. There is no way this game is worth anywhere close to the asking price. Fishlabs Entertainment doesn't deserve your money because they don't support and stand behind their products.","December 28, 2014","false","37.5"," 191 of 208 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","191","208","4","9"

If you really want it, get it for your phone.\n\nAt first I was rather excited about this. It is, in just about every way possible, a very basic, simplified, single-player version of Eve Online (even some of the ship/station names and appearances are a little too similar to be purely coincidence). It is a freelance space simulator where you are a pilot and must hop from starsystem to starsystem trying to make a living through mining, combat missions, bounty hunting, or even just freighting trade items from station to station. Then you can put your earnings towards whatever you need to further your goals, better mining equipment, tougher armor, better weapons, larger cargo holds. The idea is solid, but execution is lacking.\n\nOutside of the very very beginning of the game, mining became immediately useless as you could make far more cash in less time through combat missions. And by the end of the game even the combat missions had been phased out once you had a good cargo hauler and the ability to warp anywhere in the galaxy without having to system hop. You end up with 2 systems where you buy up all of an item for cheap, then warp to the other and sell it, then warp back and repeat.\n\nYour money also tends to just sit around. In my first hour and a half of playing I'd already found and purchanced (without the use of guides) the best armor, shields, scanner, tractor beam, repair bots, and mining laser. From there there was nothing left to upgrade apart from getting bigger ships and better weapons. And thats only cause the best weapons are pure luck as to whether you will find them, but I'd already secured the best readily available ones. It's flat upgrades across the board you are looking for and since you can sell items for the same price you buy them unlike most games, you never lose money. If its better, buy it, cause when you find the next upgrade you can just sell your current for full price and buy the next. Theres no reason to try and save money or skimp out on small upgrades as you can't really lose money even if you try.\n\nThe game is also incredibly easy. At no point did I ever die while playing, or even come close as I recall. This game originated as a mobile phone game so the controls are very simple and oversensitive with a mouse, and enemy hitboxes are unrealistically large to the point its hard to miss.\n\nIt was a mobile phone game that was poorly ported to PC. At multiple times my UI buttons would flicker on and off, some of the menus just wouldn't work requiring you close and open them a couple times, and trying to actually use any of the buttons on the HUD instead of hotkeys was the most aggrivating thing ever as it seemed to desire to actively fight swapping from having the mouse control flight to having the mouse control the UI. Click to swap to pointer mode, a second late it swaps you back to flight mode, click it again and yet again before you can get to your target button it swaps back to flight mode.\n\nTheir worst mistake? They also decided to NOT INCLUDE THE DLC!! A horrible mistake as many parts of the dlc fixed many problems with the gameplay by adding some extra use to mining, so extra storylines beyond the single super short story, extra side missions hunting down high bounty criminals to extend the end game, adding automatic turrets to actually make turrets useful, adding extra ship equipment so you dont stagnate an hour into the game with the best stuff, extra ship and star systems to hit up for better missions and gear, a main base to call your own for storing items and ships so you can have more than a single ship at any given time, and this list could go on longer. With the DLC included, this would have been a decent freelance starfighting game worth picking up on sale and playing through in a weekend. Without the DLC it is a horrible thing that will get incredibly boring shortly into your playthrough and leave you feeling incredibly cheated out with just how little they give you to do.\n\nSorry for the long post. Really wishing I'd gotten this on the phone instead...","February 17, 2015","false","22.1"," 152 of 171 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","152","171","8","0"

Trading, fighting off pirates, doing escort missions, mining asteroids for ore etc. pp.\nYou''ll earn money from doing so, which you can invest in a new spaceship and equipment. There are quite a lot of ships to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. More cargo, better hull, more slots for primary weapons...\n\nDepending on how man equipment slots you have, you can choose to install mining lasers to mine asteroids, getting different sized cabins to transport passengers, getting a shield, a cloaking device etc pp.\n\nThere is also the possibility to buy trading goods and sell them somewhere else for a higher price. Though the economy isn't really complex or deep in any way.\n\nThe main storyline isn't very long and also the systems/sectors aren't that big, they basically consist of an asteroid field, a space-station and a jumpgate.\n\nSo, if you don't mind a rather small space, repetition in quests after a while (to get money) and a relatively short main storyline, this might be for you if you liked Freelancer, Starlancer and similar games.","September 5, 2014","true","17.6"," 52 of 58 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","52","58","0","3"

It may not be as complex as the X series of games, but personally i think that is one of many plus points about this title.\n\nThis game essentially plays as a slightly dumbed down version of the classic Freelancer, and is every bit as enjoyable as the title that clearly influenced the design. So, it's easy to pick up and start playing, plus it has an engrossing storyline which it also allows you to follow at your own pace (so you can put the story on hold while you raise enough cash to buy yourself a much better ship and/or better equipment and armaments, for example).\n\nVisually the game is very pleasing, even though there are occasionally some very serious jaggied lines in clear view no matter how much anti-aliasing you're using. I run the game with 8x AA and 16x AF and yet they are still quite prominent, especially on the space stations. Incidentally, in the game configuration application it has the option to run 16x anti-aliasing but this option is always greyed out and i've never been able to select it... nor do i know anyone who has, no matter what graphics card they are using. This is one of only two negative points. The other is that stability could be improved. I've only had the game crash twice, but it is annoying when it happens during a mission and you need to start it from the beginning again.\n\nThe console versions of this game may have additional DLC which will not be coming to the PC version, and yes that is a shame that we won't be getting it, but don't let that sway you from buying it. The core game itself is extremely good and well worth buying, especially at the low price it's currently on sale for.","November 29, 2013","true","14.5"," 51 of 59 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","51","59","0","0"

I know you can't really rate a game on price, but you can value it on the principle of price and with $20, you will not get your money's worth when you can get it for free, or an older more in depth space sim for the same price or less.","March 19, 2015","true","2.3"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

The first thing you'll notice is how easy it is to control and play, even with a mouse and keyboard it's easy to pick up and master in a matter of minutes.\n\nCombat of which there is a lot is rather predictable and shallow, pirates will appear at most hubs and you'll soon find them a minor annoyance rather than a serious challenge. You can be helped by station defence fighters and by hiring wingmen to protect you although even on the hardest difficulty they are rarely needed. You are able to outfit your ship with up to four primary weapons depending on how advanced your ship is and four secondary weapons. Primary weapons constitute a selection of different laser based weapons whilst secondary are rockets and bombs.\n\nIn order to afford these upgrades you'll need to make money and you can make money quickly, easily and in a number of different ways. Completing missions is the fastest way to make money and these can be picked up from various talking heads in the bars of each space station. However they soon become repetitive and lack depth, you'll be offered a variation of defence missions, clean up missions, escort missions, retrieval and transport missions. The only thing that differs between the missions on offer is the location.\n\nThe next best way to make money is to trade goods between stations or mine for materials from asteroids from asteroid fields outside each space station. Mining is a mini game of keeping your cursor within a circle whilst it moves erratically as the circle becomes smaller. Once you've mined enough ore you can sell this on for a minor profit. Trading is a simplistic affair as you buy and sell a wide range of goods from station to station.\n\nThe worst part of the game however is the awful dialogue and amateurish voice acting, another of those occasions where just text instead of bad voice acting would have improved the game. If you can't afford good voice actors it's sometimes best not to have any. The protagonist is Keith T. Maxwell, yes you read that correctly, they named the main character Keith. The name Family Guy mocked as being the "most unattractive male first name in the English Language". Not to be outdone by such a terrible character name they follow that up with characters called 'Mkkt Bkkt' and 'Erkkt Uggut'. The plot itself isn't too bad if not clichéd. It centres on a mysterious race called the Voids who are striking at outposts across the Galaxy from wormholes and it's up to Keith to save the day. However the terrible dialogue and voice acting makes you want to avoid it or rush through it and to play the game as an open sandbox world instead.\n\nEven with all these criticisms I would however just about recommended the game. It is extremely easy to pick up and looks pretty in places. It also doesn't require a big time investment or more than a few minutes to learn the game mechanics. A lot of people have described it as a poor man's Freelancer which it is but it still enjoyable enough for fans of space-conflict games and there isn't a great choice out there at the moment. Obviously this will change with the upcoming Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen.","June 16, 2014","true","25.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

This might be a bitter decision, but it is a business decision we have to do as a independent development studio as well.

When drilling - use gamepad (not bad X360 pad support), because its nearly impossible to control it using the keyboard. So you will be forced to use 3 different controllers. Story - nothing special, but it justifies all the shooting and exploring. But when on the phone all that exploration and barter feels like "a lot of content" on PC is like a neverending chore, boring and tiring.\n\nI could recommend this game only as a bargain bin purchase for 1 buck.

The story and dialog is pretty weak, but there's still enough here for a few hours of fun.\n\nWhile there are side missions, they consist of just a few "canned" missions like transport, attack pirates, trading goods, escort, etc. They're a quick way to make money and don't add to the story. There are a few npc's that will sell you charts to "hidden" systems or special items.\n\nFor a game that tends to focus on trading, they didn't make it very intuitive. There's no way to store goods, so you either have to get a ship with LOTS of cargo space, or just sell anything you get right away. There's also no economy map. You can look at the highest\lowest known prices for each item; but prices change a lot, and so you have to constantly check which turns into a click-fest. If they just added an economy map all this could be remedied.\n\nAI is mediocre, usually the only challenge is being outnumbered 10-1. Fighting a couple ships at a time usually isn't a challenge once you get some better weapons and items. But watching AI battle each other can be painful.\n\nGraphics look decen't, but for some reason the background stars look blurry and washed out. Planets and special fx look really sharp and crisp, overall they get the job done.\n\nI'd highly recommend a controller, and to get the game on sale ($20 seems a little steep).\n\n5\10","April 11","true","20.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

It's not very deep at all, and beating the main game can be done in likely one afternoon.  There are enough little missions and variations of things to do to keep you interested as you play through the game, without a doubt.  Sometimes you have to dogfight in space against various ships, sometimes you have to escort cargo frigates, sometimes you have to smuggle some goods, and sometimes you just need to mine some minerals so you can buy a better ship or weapons.\n\nGoing for the 100% completion got a little repetitive, but most games do.  For the average gamer that doesn't care about achievements or 100%, there's still a nice little campaign to be conquered which should leave you satisfied.  If you find yourself really into the game, there are infinite side-quests of various types which you can continue to complete to grow your riches beyond your wildest dreams, even after saving the galaxy.\n\nThere's really nothing groundbreaking or amazing about the game, but it's definitely a fun experience nonetheless, and it is nice to look at.  If you like the idea of flying around a populated galaxy as a Han Solo-esque character, in various spaceships which you can upgrade and customize, completing various mission types, and saving the galaxy... then you will probably enjoy this little game.  I recommend picking this up at a price you feel comfortable with and just enjoy the scenery and simplistic action that makes the game charming.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 26, 2013","true","27.7"," 28 of 47 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","28","47","0","0"

There are games with much more in-depth economy systems, games with more advanced flight simulation, and games with a better storyline.  Like I said, it shouldn't stand out.  But it does, at least for me.\n\nSomething about this game just does it for me.  The atmosphere is handled so beautifully.  The game has a really immersing vibe, and the way everything comes together into an overall experience is just fantastic.  Particularly when starting a new game, I get really into the look and feel of the whole game.  It also has fantastic graphics and art; the ships have some really cool designs, and the stations have really sexy interiors when you're docked.  There's a lot of nice touches in the presentation as well, like difference in audio when talking to somebody in person vs over radio.\n\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, this game is better viewed as a more casual entry in the space combat/trading genre, but what it does it does well.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrJinxed/recommended/212010/","MrJinxed","Jinxtah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrJinxed/","510 products in account","Let me start off saying, this is a really short game... If you let it be. However, after having played for about 5 minutes, I was contacted by a friend on steam who saw what I was playing, and told me to take my time as the game was really short if I just followed the storyline.\n\nAs it turns out, he was right, and I'm glad I listened, because what I got was a really good experience instead of a mediocre one. The ingame timer says I completed it in 11 hours, 45 minutes, and I'd estimate the main storyline would take about 3 hours or so. That's not to say I was extremely thorough, because there's a lot more systems to see and more expensive ships to buy than what I saw, and purchased, but the game did end rather abruptly, and after it finished there was really little reason to play on (though it's a possibility as it's open ended).\n\nNow, the game is probably the closest you'll come to playing freelancer again, and it's not really in the same league at all. This is a much more simple version of the same style of gameplay, but it's not without its charms. The voice acting is appalling, but you quickly learn to just smile at it, and completely disregard it (at least that's how I coped with it).\n\nSo what makes this game fun? Well, it's one of those sandbox type games, where sure there's a main story, but you don't really care so much, as there are lots of star systems to visit, with even more planets to dock at. Each planet has a space lounge, where you are offered side missions for money, or good/bad deals in terms of merchandise. These missions range from the typical defend this convoy, or destroy the pirates, to scanning out a traitor at the local defense force, and getting shot at by everyone else afterwards until you dock, or transporting goods, or passengers to other systems. It's a good idea to do these missions, as it sets you up with a base currency so that you may buy a better ship with more equipment slots.\n\nThe real money making doesn't start to roll in until you get a so called Khador drive, which lets you travel to star systems without using a jump gate. This is part of the storyline, and won't take long to get. Once you have that, you're able to sort out what's profitable to sell where, as long as you have been docking at all stations in the system you've visited (it'll give you system name for where it's most profitable to sell a certain item at), but enough about that. Another way entirely to make money is to mine. You do this by outfitting your ship with a drill and getting a scanner, and then just drilling astroids outside the various stations. It comes with a minigame of its own, but it was rather boring, if you ask me, so I didn't really get into it.\n\nYou also have to be careful who you do missions for, or against, because there are 4 "friendly" factions in the game, and they are paired up against each other, so doing missions for the Vossk will decrease your Terran reputation to a point where they will outright shoot at you, and refuse to let you dock unless you bribe the station chief. You can fix this by paying a diplomat which sometimes spawn in space lounges if your rep is low enough, but it'll cost you a pretty penny to do so.\n\nThe story itself is nothing new. Start out with nothing and find out it's up to you to save the world.\n\nThere are many different ships to choose from in this game, and they are all different in terms of weapon/equipment slots, armor, the way it handles, and so on. You can outfit you ship with a wide range of modules, including shield, armor, tractor beam, cloak, booster, agility mod, warp drive, passanger cabins, and more. This allows for a great deal of flexibility. The weapons comes in form of primary and secondary. The primary slots are for your autocannons, blasters, lasers, and what have you, and the secondary is reserved for missiles, rockets, or emp bombs to disable enemy ships (this will also allow you to steal their cargo if you have a scanner and tractor beam for example).\n\nYou'll see combat almost everywhere you go, so some good advice would be to get a shield and an armor mod and equip them on your ship as soon as possible, and go from there.\n\nActually.. I will finish the review off with a couple of things I thought were a great shame.\n\nYou can't really play this game with a controller. The game allows for it, but this being a iOS port, it wasn't designed for it, and even if you are using a controller, everything ingame will be listed with keyboard commands on the HUD. The keyboard/mouse works well enough, so it's not a big deal, but I thought it was weird.\n\nTwo expansions were released for the iOS, which supposedly made the game a lot better, and introduced new mechanics (upgrades) and ships to buy along with a new storyline, but that will never make it to the PC.\n\n\nI could ramble on, but I suppose I've written a lot already.\nOverall I really enjoyed the game, and if you can live with a less than stellar experience, I'd recommend you get the game while discounted, and enjoy the ride. There are a ton of achievements you can chase to keep you busy, and if you want the best ships in the game, you'll be playing for many more hours than I did, so in terms of bang for buck, I certainly got mine.","June 26, 2014","true","15.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Initially on iOS, the graphics have been beautifully updated for PC.  Unfortunately, we don't get the DLC that iOS has, which is a shame since the story is so short.\n\nSadly, the game quickly becomes very predictable and repetitive: every system has planets; every planet has an asteroid belt; every planet has a single station; every station has a shop to buy/sell equipment, ships and commodities, as well as a lounge to pick up random missions and buy the occasional rare blueprint or coordinates to a hidden system, which is effectively the same as all the others. There's nothing else of note to discover or explore.\n\nYou can outfit your ship with weapons, armor, shields, cargo space, tractor beam, cloaking device, afterburner, repair bot, jump drive etc.  With only a few tiers of each, variety is lacking.  Ships are small and underwhelming.  Most content is procedurally generated and travelling gets boring very quickly.  I only recommend this to lovers of space games, and just barely.","October 20, 2012","true","26.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

You're basically paying $20 for a game that plays and feels like a game made for a mobile phone, because that's exactly what it is.\nI got it for a dollar off of HumbleBundle. I will HIGHLY recommend this for a dollar. But I will not recommend it for $1.50.\nThe company that made the game went bankrupt, and there is no PC support. All updates and patches are MAC only.\nThe biggest glaring flaw that you will run into is the fact that you will target lock allies over enemies, meaning that using guided weapons of any kind is worthless.\nThe second biggest flaw is that this game is far FAR too easy. Maybe I've been too spoiled by X Series games, EVE Online, or Evochron Mercenary (All of which, except X Rebirth, I recommend over this game). You will probably beat this game easily without even dying once.\nOverall, the game is kind of like a single hot passionate night of love with a beautiful woman, only to wake up in the morning and find out that woman was your mother. It is fun and fufilling when you first play it, but then you wake up a few hours in and realize it is nothing but a pile of shame.\n\nI'd also like to emphasize that, because the addons aren't available on PC, and never will be, the game is incredibly short, with half it's content, and ships, missing as a result.\nThe developers previously used the excuse "Sales weren't good enough on PC". Of course, with a $20 pricetag ($15 more than the mobile phone counterpart), its a wonder why, on top of the fact that most negative reviews about this game stem from the fact that none of the DLC has been, or ever will be ported to PC.\n\nI hope this helps anyone looking into this game.

It would be hard for me to recommend this game without playing it completely through.  That said, I stopped playing it within the first few hours.  Weeks later I installed it again, to give it a second chance, and again stopped playing it within the first few hours.\n\nI, honestly, found the game didn't hold my attention.  I've played games similar to this one and have been extremely drawn in by not only the galaxy but the story content, "Freelancer" comes to mind.  That said, this game really didn't have anything for me.  I found the space missions to be somewhat short and rather dull.  The commentary, aka storyline, lost my interest before I even left the first station.  Graphics were a little dated.  Equipment and effects seemed plain and ordinary.  There really wasn't anything to keep my attention.  This game isn't for me.  Note, I said "for me".\n\nThe whole reason I got this game is because it came highly recommended by some Freelancer playing friends of mine, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.  Obviously they liked it, which means there are people out there (perhaps you) who will enjoy it as well.  For me, it failed to entertain.\n\nI'm not going to recommend it, as I personally didn't enjoy it.  I'd much rather stick to Freelancer, which may be a dated game (so is this one) but is still, in my opinion, at the forefront of the space RPG and has an extensively powerful modding community.","July 8, 2014","false","0.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

There is no way to customize controller input (I used a 360 controller) and the mouse tracking is far too fast for conventional usage.  I had to turn my DPI down to about 400 before I could play properly.  The text was also far too small to read on my sub-1080p monitor.

That game was meant to be an App for iOS and Android as far as I know and was converted to the PC. The graphics are great and the HD is well deserved. The Gameplay itself is rly smoothed and it's really easy to fly around. The story itself (you travel through the time, not on purpouse, and got to defeat the 'Void') is fast played and I rly wished it was deeper, e.g. what do the Void want? Why do they rob the other nations etc. Or, Why are same nations in war and others not? They could've made much more out of it, but OK it was meant to be a game for mobiles, so whatever :)\nAfter you beat the Storyline you can do sidequests, explore the other systems and mess around farming to get the best ship. Or jsut get all the achivments on Steam!\n\nI rly wish they think about converting the AddOns on PC as well... It's kinda sad they gave us only half of the game. I really want the two AddOns. Please. Please..\n\nAnyways! Great game, Not sure if worth the 15 bucks, because the story is kinda flat and short and all you can do afterwards is exploring and farming, but if it gets on sale I'd highly recommend it.\nFun Game, nice setting and hella fun. 8/10","July 10, 2014","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So far I'm enjoying the game, it's a lot more fast paced than other large space sims and while that helps to move the game around quickly (You don't have to spend more than a few seconds in an area to hit the station and warp to the next planet) it does leave the game feeling a tad... Small.\n\nControls take a second to get used to but there aren't many of them so you'll learn fast. Features SOME gamepad support but requires the mouse during trading and navagating the stations shops/bars.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a quick, arcadey space shooter, I can't recommend it higher.

It's a kind of shallow, but easy-to-approach space sim in the same vein as Freelancer, but way, way simplified.  While relatively bug-free, the gameplay is extremely repetitive.  The voice acting isn't awful I suppose, but the script is extremely cheesy and B-movie-esque.  The story is pretty much a cut and paste from Freelancer, without the length, wow-factor or plot twists.\n\nThe sandbox gameplay is lacking any inspiration and you'll find little reason to continue playing other than you can't currently afford the best ships in the game.\n\nTo be fair, the game isn't terrible, but I'm kind of past considering that praise.  I can no longer afford to waste time or money on games anymore that don't innovate in some manner.  And being an indie title is no excuse for making a mediocre game.  In fact, the lack of time constraints and publisher pressure should, if anything, improve one's ability to look outside the box and approach even a well-travelled game concept with original ideas.","December 10, 2013","false","12.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I installed the game, and the "fun factor" is a definite 10!  The game has kept me entertained for over 10 hours now, and I have really started getting into this great game...\n\nHowever, I hit a wall today in regards to this game, and hit it hard.  I've been playing the game through Steam on my PC, and on the wiki and other pages I've been hearing all these great things about new systems, ships, upgrades, etc. that you can get with the DLC / expansions.  I rushed out to the Steam Store to buy every expansion I could find - but they aren't here!\n\nApparently, the developer decided it wasn't worth their time or effort to release the DLC / Expansions to the PC version.  Note I said "PC version" specifically, because the develeoper has released the DLC to ALL OTHER PLATFORMS (Android, iPhone, and Mac).  I can't even begin to tell you how frustrating that is... There is all this cool content that I could be enjoying, but I can't simply because the developer doesn't want to make them available to the PC players.\n\nThis basically sours the game for me.  Yeah, the base game is still fun for a while, but I find myself losing interest now because I know I am missing out on the best new content for the game.  There should be some kind of warning on the Steam version of the game, to the effect of "This game is no longer bieng updated by the developer".\n\nEnd Result:  Don't buy the game on PC if you want the full experience and enjoyment of Galaxy on Fire 2.

The enemy ai only has two modes, 1. Fly straight at enemy and fire when in range,  2. when you get close, turn around and fly straight away from the enemy or at a slight angle, turn around when far enough and repeat from the top.\n\n\nOn top of that, all the npcs are actually faster than your ship. You have only one speed, and its slower than all npcs except large freighters can move by default. (and even the large freighters are almost as fast as you). The only way to keep up is to use the booster addon you can install to your ship, and its sort of a 5 second speed boost followed by a long wait for another, with inertia absolutely not conserved whatsoever. In combat, actually, npcs will slow down to as fast as the player can move, and then at scripted distances will speed up suddenly to normal speed.\n\n\nThe story starts cheesy, gets good, and then ends horribly really quick. That ending, man.\n\nIt feels like the dev team started with a good concept and got most of the resources and plot done for the first chapter of what was supposed to be a AA game for iOS, and then got bought out and fired and replaced with a team of college students with a 1 month-from-now release deadline.\n\nThe gameplay as a whole is pretty nice and a good timewaster, but enjoy the random sandboxy stuff you can do and don't dive too quickly into the main missions or you'll find it ending really suddenly (With a pretty terrible ending that also leaves more questions then awnsers).\n\n\nTurrets are absolutely useless. Don't even bother with them. They're all manual, and in order to make them not useless hood ornaments you have to open the interface, press the turret button, and then slowly wheel the turret around while your ship helplessly flys in the direction you left it.\n\nApparently automated turrets were added in an expansion, but the expansions are only purchasable if you have the iOS version of this game, and the devs have clearly stated that they are NOT bringing the two expansions to the pc version EVER because they're "a mobile gaming company".","March 20, 2015","true","6.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"

And the controls are great, barring that you annoyingly need to use the mouse for shops and menus.\n\nThe game is somewhat open-world, though each of the planets has roughly the same features (space station with varying degrees of "tech level" which determines what equipment and ships are for sale, asteroid field with different materials, faction ships, pirates, sometimes a pirate space station, etc.), and there isn't much variety for missions (help defend area against pirates, escort large cargo ships, ferry people or materials to area, etc.), and the story is nothing special.  But it's still fun.  You mine asteroids or destroy/disable ships for their cargo to sell to stations for money to buy better ships and equipment, and there's a Skip button for all the story bits if you really want to go that far.\n\nAll ships have a number of stats, being how well-armored they are or how many primary weapons you can equip at once, and there is a lot of equipment choices, so there is a lot for customizing and agonizing over which equipment to take this mission.  Combat is fairly basic, with three-dimensional movement, optional boosting, instant braking, throttle control, and strafing, so you won't have anything fancy like somersaults to get behind the enemy, or rolls to deflect enemy fire.\n\nI overall recommend the game if you want a light third-person space shooter game, though I would say buy it only at $10 or so, as $20 without the expansion content the mobile devices have is a bit steep.","December 15, 2012","true","17.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

I wouldn't pay 20.00 for it though as it seems the tablet version has ALOT more content. Also there are issues with the  controller support. when exiting a space station or switching in and out of Auto pilot your controller may stop functioning...sometimes temporarilly  (20 sec) sometime you have to restart the game. Also i have had it crash a couple of time right after this has happened. In any case if you can get it for 5.00 like i did it is well worth that price and i am enjoying the game. Again without the support of the DLC's fromt he mobile platform this game is simply not worth full 20.00 price tag.

Despite that,  this game was well worth the fun.   This was very easy getting into it and play for fun.    Learning curve is very low which I enjoyed when in mood of a casual game.\n\nThis game has difficulty setting you can choose from Easy to Hard.   I went with Easy difficulty and spent 25 hours playing to 100% completed the game.  In a perspective of achievements,  this game can get a bit grindy but that feeling came very late when I only needed several hours to finish off this game.   The story itself is unfortunately very short.   I did not count but probably around 10-15 story missions at most.   That is quite short.\n\nSo obviously the aim of this game is not the story but rather immersing yourself in a relatively small galaxy doing side missions to make money here and there.   There is also mining.   Mining was very simple to do in this game, can be difficult or easy depending on Mining equipment you have.  Combat wise,  you will find it similar to some of very simple arcade games you played before.    If you have not play anything like this,  I would take an extra step and tell you that this game will be an ideal game to play.   Again, very simple and easy get into the game.   It should take no more than an hour to get that feeling of this game.\n\nOverall,  I enjoyed this game I picked up from a bundle.

I am a PC gamer and it was released on PC thus its passes or fails based on what I would expect for PC games.  Now that’s out of the way GOF2 is your basic space combat explore\combat game. (Freelancer, Privateer)  Similar to those older games you get dropped in a ship\fighter and allowed to roam the universe. The fun is derived by completing missions to build up skill and cash and then upgrade your ship.  In this GOF2 main core has decent potential.  However the pacing of the ships and weapons wasn’t well thought out.  I spent the entire main story game in 2 ships, and never was close to getting any of the larger ships until long after the game was effectively over.  If that was GOF2’s only flaw then I believe we could all ignore it.  However GOF2 is cursed with a Mass Effect 2 planet scanning mini-game that is core to the gameplay.  Whoever on the design team thought it would be fun to issue an uncontrollable mining technique to create a challenge clearly has missed their calling and should apply at the Creative torture center of the CIA.  The plot of these games is largely secondary to the experience, which in the case of this title is good because it’s utter nonsense.   The way the feelings of the player character and Carla develop indicate it was written by someone with a 12 year old’s understanding of an adult relationship.  Yet to be fair there is a lot of potential in this game, a better plot and MUCH better writing would go a long way to help.  More time spent balancing the ships values and mission variety would have also gone a long way to help.   I was borderline on recommending this game because let’s be frank they don’t make these kind of games anymore.   Yet I can’t ignore the glaring problems and woeful shortcomings.

It's a good game (not great, but fun none the less). Graphics sure ain't 'full hd', they are mildly outdated but okay enough. Story is weak, gameplay is reasonably fun, the customisability of ships is interesting and marketplaces across the galaxy vary, making it fun. Trading can be very profitable as well.\n\nSadly, I found the only true way to get particularly rich is to just turn evil. Really hard to scrounge up the cash other than by being a pirate and raiding lucrative cargo carriers. If you manage to ♥♥♥♥ (annoy, since censors dislike the p word) off one of the factions, you can just spend your time in other territory and most of the time if a mission drags you to an enemy faction, you can just speed in and out with minimal damage. Not that I really hate 'evil' play but I wish there was an equal option to be good and still be profitable. Missions stop at in the double digit thousands for rewards, while you can make a million blowing up a human carrier with a particularly good cargo.\n\nOn top of this, the game is pricey, and the plot short. While you can continue playing after you save the galaxy, it is pretty much pointless. Missions are rarely very risky or even fun once you upgrade, and travelling around deep space can be slow and painful until you get a warp drive.\n\nIf it was on special, I'd recommend it, but not full price. I think I pulled it out of a humble bundle.","November 10, 2014","false","10.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The standard price is $20, 4x the cost of both DLC's on the mobile game (excluding quick access to Kaamo).\n\nCurrently, if Fishlabs (the devolpers) were to have some sort of massive problem and shut down all work on the PC version, I would go with the mobile version.

You should have made it clear this is NOT the full version. There's no DLC for PC and the best parts of this game are in the add-ons. No Shima System means no Kaamo Club. That means no saving or storing multiple ships and no access at all to the best ships. Buyer beware... This is a crippled port of ONLY part of the game.  There was no indication of that before buying.  On that basis, I give it a thumbs down. But for a properly informed player, I recommend the game as an enjoyable distraction that won't fry your nerves -- and only if you get it at a huge discount.","June 12, 2014","true","128.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay basically boils down to holding down the mousebutton at an enemy with little to no strategy and/or running and failing to dodge. Its got other stuff to do, but really its not the best experience ever.

Voice acting?! My WORD! How did they ever fit all of that onto a few A: discs back then?? It's like Elite but...like..MORE Elite! Wow! And GUNS! You can shoot GUNS! And a space station?! And..and...you can buy things! And when you fly around you actually fly AROUND, like, 3D like! None of that silly business where you look down upon your ship and fire up the screen at a formation of drones but....\n\nOkay, look... I'm laying on the sarcasm as hard as possible because somehow this game was actually being sold for actual money. I'm not sure if anyone else noticed but the ship moves so slow I kept expecting a granny with a walker to float by. "Combat" is laughable because the dogfighting is more like watching fish lull around in a tank. I tried crashing into the space station but...no...that didn't help make the game more fun. I guess mining is the cool part because it presents the only challenge in the game. And...um...whatever. This game was released just a couple years ago but I would have pegged it for a couple decades instead.\n\nUnless someone can tell me how to unlock "FUN MODE" then I'm just going to say that it's a pile of crap.\n\nAnyone know how to "give away" a game on here?

NO further DLC has been added, nor will it ever be, given the developer's (FishLabs) abhorrent attitude to the PC community.\n\nWhat's the Story?\nYou play as Keith T. Maxwell, a space 'soldier' who is whisked several decades into the future after a malfunction in engaging his hyperspace drive. Keith is now stranded in an unfamiliar section of the universe with no money, no ship (now obsolete and damaged beyond repair).\n\nThankfully he is rescued, and brought to the nearest space station. Here you start with a basic ship and no money. To begin with you must slowly make money by mining asteroids to pay off your saviour. Then you are let loose to follow the storyline of trying to re-assimilate yourself in this new sector of space.\n\nYou learn of a hostile alien race known as the Voids. They control wormholes between their homeworld and any parts of the universe to attack various other space stations, wreaking havoc and causing distress to all of the resident alien factions. It is up to you, with the help of others, to defeat the Voids and restore peace to the universe.\n\nThus the storyline is linear, predictable and rather boring. If you value this aspect of game design, you have nothing to find here :P\n\nWhat's the open-world 'Universe' to discover?\nThe whole 'universe' as such in the game is from Keith's POV a previously uncharted sector of the universe. It consists of 22 Star systems. Each has an un-visitable star surrounded which is surrounded by several un-visitable planets. (all gameplay takes place either in space surrounding the space station or within the space station itself)\n\nOrbiting (more like next to) each planet is a space station which one can enter (not seamlessly - loading screens are key) within which various functions may be performed:\n\n- Automatic ship-repairs (armour bar fills up - yay)\n- Automatic Updating of Steam Achievement Progress#\n- Space Lounge (talk to different people for side objectives)\n\n- Hangar (consists of Shop, Ship and Blueprints):\n- Shop (sell/buy resources, equipment, weaponry)\n- Ship (equip equipment, weaponry)\n- Blueprints (build equipment/weaponry by collecting a certain amount of different resources)","December 24, 2015","false","35.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

It is not just flying around and killing stuff.  You have to earn credits to upgrade your ship by doing all sorts of different missions like escorting ships, destroying junk in space, mining stuff, etc.  Also in regards to the flying it is not even close to as complicated as other games and that is welcome.  In regards to the graphics for this game let me just say it had me taking screenshot after screenshot because it was so beautiful at times.  I also have to say the story has been fun and the humour in it actually did make me laugh thus far.  After 2 hrs+ of play I know I will be going back to playing this game soon.  I definitely recommend this to others.","October 9, 2014","true","2.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The tutorial is very bland and lacks information about the game. It doesn’t explain anything besides ship controls and fast traveling. The game attempts to teach you as you go along but that takes away from its simplicity and turns it into complexity and frustration which can very commonly be associated with the X series, because you find yourself pondering around trying to figure something only to realise the game doesn’t want you to know till later. After completing the tutorial I struggled to understand what the game wanted me to do, the HUD is absolutely horrible. You have your spaceship and around the spaceship there is a visible ring that represents all the possible locations and markers in the current area, however it absolutely fails when you are in a high speed chase attempting to combat enemies, it moves around and fails to indicate which direction you are supposed to head in for example during a quest. The idea itself is good but was poorly executed and lacked any sort of polishing. The combat system is a simple dodge and attack or simply run and gun. There is no innovation to it. The game is also filled with bugs, over the course of 1 hour that I played this game and decided I do not wish to invest any more time into this insipid game I have encountered quite a few game breaking bugs. After accepting a quest the marker did not appear at all forcing me to restart the game multiple times. Sometimes a quest tells you to go and kill X amount of enemies which do not even spawn prompting a reset, all these bugs are infuriating and will most likely never be patched as the developer seemingly went out of business apparently. Another problem with the game is that it forces you to grind from the very start. After you complete the first few quests assuming you don’t turn off the game by then, you are told to kill time by doing quests or just venturing from station to station. It seems the game wants to introduce you to how missions work in the GOF2 universe but there is nothing to introduce the player to as all you get are the same 3 quests over and over again. I completed about 4 of those quests in my hour of playtime and the game still didn’t prompt me to continue. That very point is when I stopped playing and simply decided it’s a game that should have stayed on a tablet. There is a major issue with the controls on the controller. The prompts are not even visible and the tutorial doesn’t state what buttons to use to perform certain actions, it might as well have a block of text that says “Press the glide button to glide.” There are many achievements but they are mere mirrors of each other, it’s the same achievements for most of the time that is rewarded for an action such as mining 50T of ores, the next achievement is granted for mining 150T and so on for the majority.\n\n\nPOSITIVES:\n\nThe game runs really well being a tablet port I would assume it has to run well, however it delivers very beautiful visuals at times and for someone like me with a bad computer its quiet a nice thing to have your game run constantly at above 60FPS. The game also has a vast world to explore as well as many weapons and ship upgrades that the player can attain, if they are willing to get past the grinding stage. The controls are decent on keyboard and mouse that is.\n\n\nVERDICT:\n\nThe game is not that great it has many flaws however there are certain small positives that might improve one’s experience. Don’t buy it wait for a sale and then buy it, unless you really want to.","November 2, 2014","false","1.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Voice acting?! My WORD! How did they ever fit all of that onto a few A: discs back then?? It's like Elite but...like..MORE Elite! Wow! And GUNS! You can shoot GUNS! And a space station?! And..and...you can buy things! And when you fly around you actually fly AROUND, like, 3D like! None of that silly business where you look down upon your ship and fire up the screen at a formation of drones but....\n\nOkay, look... I'm laying on the sarcasm as hard as possible because somehow this game was actually being sold for actual money. I'm not sure if anyone else noticed but the ship moves so slow I kept expecting a granny with a walker to float by. "Combat" is laughable because the dogfighting is more like watching fish lull around in a tank. I tried crashing into the space station but...no...that didn't help make the game more fun. I guess mining is the cool part because it presents the only challenge in the game. And...um...whatever. This game was released just a couple years ago but I would have pegged it for a couple decades instead.\n\nUnless someone can tell me how to unlock "FUN MODE" then I'm just going to say that it's a pile of crap.\n\nAnyone know how to "give away" a game on here? You can have my key. This game is garbage.\n\nLike, Boba Fett garbage.\n\nWait, I take it back. That was some sweet garbage floating around with Boba Fett.","February 5, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","0","0","5","4","0"

That's the sum of what I feel about Galaxy on Fire 2. It's a better looking version of the much beloved Freelancer without the interesting story, characters, and overall sense immersion.\n\nAs someone who likes space sims to a certain capacity, I liked playing this game on my first gen Nexus 7 tablet as a freebie. Like I said, it looks pretty, at least it sold me on Tegra 3 at the time. Plenty of well designed ships that can be outfitted with various weapons and equipment to choose from, and I thought it played well enough given that the touch controls didn't give me carpal tunnel during combat. It's a good, probably even a great game on the mobile platforms. But the standards on PC are a bit higher and I can't say that this game measures up.\n\n$20 is asking a bit too much considering the other options out there. I got my copy for $7 during a random sale, which I'll say is a good point of entry for a space sim that looks and plays well but lacks the depth of what other games of the genre can offer. But still, like the X games are way too complicated for me to get into, GoF2 is a little too simplistic.","August 14, 2014","false","24.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You travel from sector to sector, defeating ships, taking their loot, mining, whatever tickles your fancy. Each Sector is comprised of a varying amount of planets, usually no more than around 6, and each planet has a space station that you can visit.\n\nNow, that doesn't meant the whole sector is one huge map you can fly around. The entire game is a series of small to medium sized maps. Each space station is a small-medium map you can fly around in. I'd say it'd take 40 seconds to 1.3 minutes to fly from one side of the map to the other.\n\nEach space station has a Commodities Market that you can buy and sell goods at, meaning you can spend your time buying low in one sector and selling high in another if you wished. It even tells you where you saw the specific good, or more importantly, where you saw it selling for the most and where you saw it being sold the least. It's a nice feature. You can also mine asteroids and make a fair amount from that too. Each station sells different Ships, Weapons, Missiles, Commodities, and Miscellaneous Equipment so you'll have to travel around a bit to find what your looking for sometimes.\n\nSpeaking of ships, there's quite a number of different ships, each having it's own unique appearance(though not always). They each have different amounts of health, armour, shields, weapon slots, equipment slots, speed, etc., so it's quite possible to find a ship that meets you play style perfectly. There's a fair amount of weapons too, and they all have reasonably different effects and stats from each other too.\n\nEach Station also has a 'Lounge' where you find people offering a small variety of things: 1) They can offer you a mission for an amount of money dependent of the missions difficulty. 2) They can offer to become you're Wingman for a certain amount of time for a reasonable price. 3) They can offer to sell you a varying amount of Commodities or Equipment at a reduced price, so you can sell it for profit later. 4) And sometimes they don't really do anything but chat with you, though sometimes they'll tell you which sector is selling what and sometimes at what price.\n\nThe combat is fun, and you're not required to do the main story for too long. You start with nothing really, and you'll slowly be given more equipment as the story goes, until you eventually get the ability to jump to different sectors freely. It doesn't take long until you're allowed to do as you wish, so just hang in there.\n\nWhile you can get new ships, it DOES take quite a while until you're given missions that reward a decent amount of money, so that can take a while. It's slow enough in the beginning to where you'll be VERY tempted to just cheat and use a memory editor to give your self loads of money.\n\nAnyway, this is a pretty fun game at a pretty low price. Definitely worth it.","June 26, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a mobile/tablet port that's just better off staying on that platform because the control interface suits it well than a mouse or joystick. I was really looking forward to another flight sim that has joystick capabilities. It works but it doesn't feel exactly right.\n\nWhat I didn't like about this game were the terrible reverse physics logic, voice acting, the characters, side missions on REPEAT just to continue to raise money, and Mission 11. What I mean when I say "reverse physics logic" is the sad idea that certain objects are not approachable and others are. If you approach a capital ship or a space station and you're too close it will auto redirect your flight path or simply PUSH you in another direction. Whereas, if you're NEAR an asteroid in passing, then it randomly explodes just because you're near it and you haven't really come in contact with it. It's terrible. Also, there's no such thing as collision with OTHER space craft! The voice acting and characters feel phoned in and hammy. As stated before, the side missions are only there to raise money and maybe raise your tech level but there's only a few types as they're constantly RECYCLED missions. Endlessly there to provide work for you so you can raise millions of dollars for the ships and equipment you'll use. Mission 11 is quite possibly the worst mission in this game because it revolves around mining. Anyone who's played this mission will say I'm whining because I suck yet something tells me they only had to deal with TWO enemy space craft whereas I had to fight against SIX. With superiror ships like the Veteran and Anaan (granted not THE best ship compared to others), I still got destroyed countless times trying to complete the most boring aspect of this game.\n\nWhat I liked about this game is simple. It looks great visually with all the graphics and designs along with the variety of space craft to offer. With each space craft, they have their own unique stats and equipment slots you can customize with. That's it. Pretty game with many space craft options and the abilities.\n\nI only recommend this when it goes on sale. If you feel like you wasted your money, even then, I can understand.

That's the sum of what I feel about Galaxy on Fire 2. It's a better looking version of the much beloved Freelancer without the interesting story, characters, and overall sense immersion.\n\nAs someone who likes space sims to a certain capacity, I liked playing this game on my first gen Nexus 7 tablet as a freebie. Like I said, it looks pretty, at least it sold me on Tegra 3 at the time. Plenty of well designed ships that can be outfitted with various weapons and equipment to choose from, and I thought it played well enough given that the touch controls didn't give me carpal tunnel during combat. It's a good, probably even a great game on the mobile platforms. But the standards on PC are a bit higher and I can't say that this game measures up.\n\n$20 is asking a bit too much considering the other options out there. I got my copy for $7 during a random sale, which I'll say is a good point of entry for a space sim that looks and plays well but lacks the depth of what other games of the genre can offer. But still, like the X games are way too complicated for me to get into, GoF2 is a little too simplistic.","August 14, 2014","false","24.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you loved Privateer or Freelancer games, I'm sure you won't be dissapointed by this one.\nHovewer, some negative aspects of the game should be noted. Targeting a planet for a jump while in an asteroid belt may prove a pain in the A as crosshair tend to lock nearest asteroid instead of a planet. The biggest dissapointment, of course, is that PC version of this game lacks both DLC's, which are otherwise available on consoles.\nThis game provides several hours of enjoyable gameplay, but considering the PC version I would recommend to hold your money until it's available at a discount (which was the reason I originally bought it).","May 20, 2014","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You travel from sector to sector, defeating ships, taking their loot, mining, whatever tickles your fancy. Each Sector is comprised of a varying amount of planets, usually no more than around 6, and each planet has a space station that you can visit.\n\nNow, that doesn't meant the whole sector is one huge map you can fly around. The entire game is a series of small to medium sized maps. Each space station is a small-medium map you can fly around in. I'd say it'd take 40 seconds to 1.3 minutes to fly from one side of the map to the other.\n\nEach space station has a Commodities Market that you can buy and sell goods at, meaning you can spend your time buying low in one sector and selling high in another if you wished. It even tells you where you saw the specific good, or more importantly, where you saw it selling for the most and where you saw it being sold the least. It's a nice feature. You can also mine asteroids and make a fair amount from that too. Each station sells different Ships, Weapons, Missiles, Commodities, and Miscellaneous Equipment so you'll have to travel around a bit to find what your looking for sometimes.\n\nSpeaking of ships, there's quite a number of different ships, each having it's own unique appearance(though not always). They each have different amounts of health, armour, shields, weapon slots, equipment slots, speed, etc., so it's quite possible to find a ship that meets you play style perfectly. There's a fair amount of weapons too, and they all have reasonably different effects and stats from each other too.\n\nEach Station also has a 'Lounge' where you find people offering a small variety of things: 1) They can offer you a mission for an amount of money dependent of the missions difficulty. 2) They can offer to become you're Wingman for a certain amount of time for a reasonable price. 3) They can offer to sell you a varying amount of Commodities or Equipment at a reduced price, so you can sell it for profit later. 4) And sometimes they don't really do anything but chat with you, though sometimes they'll tell you which sector is selling what and sometimes at what price.\n\nThe combat is fun, and you're not required to do the main story for too long. You start with nothing really, and you'll slowly be given more equipment as the story goes, until you eventually get the ability to jump to different sectors freely. It doesn't take long until you're allowed to do as you wish, so just hang in there.\n\nWhile you can get new ships, it DOES take quite a while until you're given missions that reward a decent amount of money, so that can take a while. It's slow enough in the beginning to where you'll be VERY tempted to just cheat and use a memory editor to give your self loads of money.\n\nAnyway, this is a pretty fun game at a pretty low price. Definitely worth it.","June 26, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Elite, Privateer and Freelancer have not had any particularly brillant successors.\n\nGalaxy on Fire is good, and does still belong at very the end of that list.  The ship designs are excellent, weapons fire, local stars and nebula look beautiful.  The sounds are great, and the music is awesome even if it gets repetitive after a couple of hours.\n\nI found the overall experience astonishing on ipad, because of what the developers were able to run on such  a weak gaming platform, but on PC it's a lot less impressive, even with the higher resolution textures.  Visuals are better than Freelancer, not as good as X3.\n\nThe combat is simple, but fun, and very reminisent of Freelancer.  Upgrading your ship is rewarding and will keep you cracking through the game despite the lacklustre storyline and it's cheesy cartoon characters.\n\nThe trading is very simple, with no real economy to speak of, so if you're a fan of X3 or Eve Online because of the economy and empire building aspect of the gameplay, then this won't be enough to keep you interested for very long.\n\nThe DLC availble for the ipad version is not availble for the PC release.\n\nMy advice - if you spend a lot of time gaming on an ipad - then get it FREE in SD (or very cheap in HD) from the app store.  If you want it for PC and the price isn't cheap enough for you, wait until Elite 4 or Star Citizen come out in 2015-onwards.

Maxwell.  You get to explore a small section of the galaxy and do different kinds of missions. The game is open ended, letting you play for countless hours. The game is great and there are hardly any major bugs or glitches. The graphics are great and each star system has a unique appearence which is great. Though I have a few complaints. Occasionaly the game crashes when I go through a jump gate, making it irritating when travling non-stop to a far side of the map. Another complaint is that unlike the app for IOS, you don't get any dlcs and the station known as "Kaamo" (where you can store supplies and ships.) The games freelance jobs pay good money, but can be repetative and often can be too easy (atleast for me). Another complaint is that the main story alone can take about an hour to beat. The only time consuming thing that makes the game longer is doing side quests and trying to get new ships and gear. However, the game has pretty smooth gameplay and has many different things to offer. You can mine, fight, explore, do missions, and trade goods. My biggest complaint is that the IOS version of this is FREE while the PC version is $20. I find it unfair to waste money on something that is free somewhere else. If the price was a bit lower I would possibly find it more fair. Even though the game offers some good gameplay, It's still exactly the same as the mobile version and lacks qualities that made it great. I would not recommend this game. If you want this game, get the phone/tablet version of this game.","January 19, 2014","false","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You want to read everything and listen to the characters voices, it's really well made and you find yourself remembering names and places that in most games you skip through. Not only that, the story is optional, there are some benefits from it that I have experienced so far but nothing says you can't fly off and do what you want.\n\nCustomisation - You can buy multiple ships with different benefits, some with more weapons, cargo space, equipment slots etc.. Multiple weapons can be equipped, including different types so you can mix and match to suit your playstyle. Equipment slots let you equip enhancements like Shields, Armour, Speed boosts, Mining equipment and more. You can turn your ship into what you want it to be.\n\nFreedom - As I said above, nothing stops you from going anywhere, earning Credits(currency) how you please. You can go to safe Systems and mine rocks in comfort, sell them at stations to pure profit. You can buy/sell commodities to and from stations. You can complete side missions for NPCs, involving Pirate killing, transport, selling items to them and many other activities. Or go hunt down enemy factions and take what you want, then sell it off. Much to do!\n\nGraphics - I think the graphics are great. The Systems in the game all look spectacular and the Planets are superbly well made. You see the screenshots, I need say no more.\n\nOther stuff;\nTravelling is very well made and navigation help is quite minimal.\nScanning / Lock on system is also really cool. No simple button to instant loot, you have to aim your tractor beam at your loot and allow it to fully activate, same with auto navigation, you must lock onto your target before auto navigating. Both can be improved by buying better equipement.\n\nThere are only very minor niggles for me. Firstly the AI sometimes seems a little lacking, they'll fly right through asteroids and sometimes I have exited a Station inside one. The asteroid generation is also similar, sometimes you get asteroids clipped into the Station / Jump gate. The Auto navigation is also a bit silly, It will fly your ship directly into an asteroid, it doesn't fly around objects. Again not too big of a deal but it could be improved.\n\nOverall the game is worth it by far for space sim lovers and anyone alike.","February 21, 2014","true","24.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Elite, Privateer and Freelancer have not had any particularly brillant successors.\n\nGalaxy on Fire is good, and does still belong at very the end of that list.  The ship designs are excellent, weapons fire, local stars and nebula look beautiful.  The sounds are great, and the music is awesome even if it gets repetitive after a couple of hours.\n\nI found the overall experience astonishing on ipad, because of what the developers were able to run on such  a weak gaming platform, but on PC it's a lot less impressive, even with the higher resolution textures.  Visuals are better than Freelancer, not as good as X3.\n\nThe combat is simple, but fun, and very reminisent of Freelancer.  Upgrading your ship is rewarding and will keep you cracking through the game despite the lacklustre storyline and it's cheesy cartoon characters.\n\nThe trading is very simple, with no real economy to speak of, so if you're a fan of X3 or Eve Online because of the economy and empire building aspect of the gameplay, then this won't be enough to keep you interested for very long.\n\nThe DLC availble for the ipad version is not availble for the PC release.\n\nMy advice - if you spend a lot of time gaming on an ipad - then get it FREE in SD (or very cheap in HD) from the app store.  If you want it for PC and the price isn't cheap enough for you, wait until Elite 4 or Star Citizen come out in 2015-onwards.

Your hitbox extends way out from your ship, meaning that enemies hit you incredibly easily, but they are also incredibly stupid, turning and running from you (allowing you to shoot them from behind) even when they have the distinct advantage.

Overall, the designed mechanics are exciting and addictive. You choose your own ship, your own weapons, and your own style of play. You even get to choose which factions you want to commit piracy against, which is in fact profitable. Speaking of which, the game economy itself is broad and very much worth exploring.\n\nThe only downsides I point out in Galaxy on Fire 2 in order to discourage are that the developer has decided not to port the expansions to the game to PC at all and that they have made the game pretty much unmoddable.

Only merits about a 6 on the PC space sim scale.\n\nPretty bland, shallow, and underwhelming when compared to games like Freelancer, X, and Tachyon. Nothing wrong with it mechanically (it plays perfectly naturally using a 360 controller, other than some menus that require using a mouse), but all of the systems look the same, with the same randomly-generated asteroid field, handful of ships, and a single space station. None of them have anything distinctive or memorable about them, and they totally lack the vast feelings of scale in some of the more well known space sims. Main storyline is short, completely by the book, and with no surprises -- thoroughly uninspired in general.\n\nThe main appeal of the game is for those who enjoy space trading and/or like the feeling of progression in games that let you upgrade your gear.

Maxwell.  You get to explore a small section of the galaxy and do different kinds of missions. The game is open ended, letting you play for countless hours. The game is great and there are hardly any major bugs or glitches. The graphics are great and each star system has a unique appearence which is great. Though I have a few complaints. Occasionaly the game crashes when I go through a jump gate, making it irritating when travling non-stop to a far side of the map. Another complaint is that unlike the app for IOS, you don't get any dlcs and the station known as "Kaamo" (where you can store supplies and ships.) The games freelance jobs pay good money, but can be repetative and often can be too easy (atleast for me). Another complaint is that the main story alone can take about an hour to beat. The only time consuming thing that makes the game longer is doing side quests and trying to get new ships and gear. However, the game has pretty smooth gameplay and has many different things to offer. You can mine, fight, explore, do missions, and trade goods. My biggest complaint is that the IOS version of this is FREE while the PC version is $20. I find it unfair to waste money on something that is free somewhere else. If the price was a bit lower I would possibly find it more fair. Even though the game offers some good gameplay, It's still exactly the same as the mobile version and lacks qualities that made it great. I would not recommend this game.

You want to read everything and listen to the characters voices, it's really well made and you find yourself remembering names and places that in most games you skip through. Not only that, the story is optional, there are some benefits from it that I have experienced so far but nothing says you can't fly off and do what you want.\n\nCustomisation - You can buy multiple ships with different benefits, some with more weapons, cargo space, equipment slots etc.. Multiple weapons can be equipped, including different types so you can mix and match to suit your playstyle. Equipment slots let you equip enhancements like Shields, Armour, Speed boosts, Mining equipment and more. You can turn your ship into what you want it to be.\n\nFreedom - As I said above, nothing stops you from going anywhere, earning Credits(currency) how you please. You can go to safe Systems and mine rocks in comfort, sell them at stations to pure profit. You can buy/sell commodities to and from stations. You can complete side missions for NPCs, involving Pirate killing, transport, selling items to them and many other activities. Or go hunt down enemy factions and take what you want, then sell it off. Much to do!\n\nGraphics - I think the graphics are great. The Systems in the game all look spectacular and the Planets are superbly well made. You see the screenshots, I need say no more.\n\nOther stuff;\nTravelling is very well made and navigation help is quite minimal.\nScanning / Lock on system is also really cool. No simple button to instant loot, you have to aim your tractor beam at your loot and allow it to fully activate, same with auto navigation, you must lock onto your target before auto navigating. Both can be improved by buying better equipement.\n\nThere are only very minor niggles for me. Firstly the AI sometimes seems a little lacking, they'll fly right through asteroids and sometimes I have exited a Station inside one. The asteroid generation is also similar, sometimes you get asteroids clipped into the Station / Jump gate. The Auto navigation is also a bit silly, It will fly your ship directly into an asteroid, it doesn't fly around objects. Again not too big of a deal but it could be improved.\n\nOverall the game is worth it by far for space sim lovers and anyone alike.","February 21, 2014","true","24.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I beat the game on normal in roughly 7 hours play time. I honestly wouldnt mind trying a higher difficulty if there was an insentive, but the equipment is pretty limited compared to other space games (I basicly hit the best equipment within 4 hours of play time). After I got my gear I was expecting to hit harder areas especially since some were considered "risky" and "dangerous",  but the difficulty seemed to stay roughly the same. My problems with the game summarized would be: there is only 1 ship class size available (that I know of), the run time is to short, and there is a serious lack of equipment variences. I believe there is only 3 different lvls to each type of equipment, which means that you could honestly have one of the best weapons in the game within farming 40k-80k which may take you an hour at the start.\n\nAlso on a side note I hated the mining :P it was a pain in the butt to do and it wasnt particularly worth it compared to mugging people.","February 25, 2015","false","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

GoF2 combines all the best elements of past Space Exploration, Trading, Combatting games into one. The graphics are stunning and will leave you wanting to explore new systems for hours on end.\n\nShip control and firing is done through using your mouse. The system is identical to freelancer in a lot of ways and I find to be the best way. The story mode is engaging and well worth the play. Character voices have been meticulously developed for all of the missions and really fit within the game quite well. You have many options while playing GoF2. You can either do all the story missions, or if you get tired of those, you can go trading, mining ores, doing side missions you can pick up from the Space Lounge which include cargo delivery, pirate hunting and killing, transporting people from one star system to another, and you can even find great deals on rare items being sold at times.\n\nCombat is pretty straight forward. Depending on your ship (and there are a great deal of different ships to buy), you can have a number of different types of weapons equipped. Ship movement is handled by moving your mouse. Ship speed is handled by your mouse's wheel scroller and firing primary and secondary weapons are handled with your left and right mouse buttons respectively.\n\nThe only downside to this game is that there is no online or Co-op multiplayer. It would be great to play with other people around the world and team up in fleet's to go exploring and pillaging deep space. However, having said that, in one way its also good that its not online, simply because if it was, it would more than likely be the standard PVP style that leaves you without the option to opt out of PVP battles which is a trend in online space exploration games.\n\nIf you love space games, Galaxy on Fire 2 HD is one you should not live without.

I wish the PC version had the DLC, and I understand from the wiki that the company may be in financial trouble so these may not make it to the PC version.  *sigh*\n\nPlus, grrl gamers, be prepared to suspend your feminism yet again -- think of this as a retro 1950s space shooter -- at least, I hope that's what they meant, right?  Because otherwise these guys were so retrocranially inverted about gender issues, they belong with the boys who cheer the dickwolves.  Some of the dialogue is just painful if you are female.\n\nThe first scientist they rescue is never questioned to be male in any of the pronouns.  Unlike the manly men who fight, he's stammering and skinny.  The second scientist appears -- amazingly she's his boss!  She's beautiful and it's so surprising she has brains and is a looker.  So the hero can't possibly take her into a dangerous situation.  Upon returning from said situation, he refuses to do his next assignment for her (presumably his acting CO at this point?) unless she promises him a date upon his successful return...\n\now ow ow ow ow...\n\nYeah, it's all supposed to be romantic...or post ironic...or something...I guess?

It has pretty visuals and fast engine. In the case of space sims it comes from the technical realisation, there are less polygons to move than in most of other genres so game designers can use the extra processing power on speed and lights that look really good here. Considering that originally it is a mobile game (first I saw it there, it is pectacular on mobos) the HD graphics in the PC version that I played is quite decent too. The overall atmosphere is really nice and space-y LIKE IT SHOULD, you get into the feel in seconds. The ship flies and shoots well, the mouse drive function gives me no desire for attaching my game controller. It is a nice working space fighting engine.\n\nWhere it lacks is where its buddies Freelancer and Darkstar One do: the content that fills the big space with life. The side missions become repetitive after a while as if there was a big book of space sims with patterns to follow, e.g. you get the missions in the bar the same way as in many space sime games before and the skeleton of the missions share that, too. The beautiful big star system feels to be empty after a while and the main story is rather predictable with no real depth. If you fly by the storyline you can finish the game rather soon.\n\nApart from that, it is an enjoyable space shooter and developers did everything to enhance the experience and reduce unnecessary time burn. The time speedup function is one of the friendliest around and it has the best planetary nav computer programming I've seen so far in any space sim. Due to its mobile origin, flying commands are simplified to the bone and they work pretty fine. Minigames (like asteroid mining) are fun and dialogs have a good sense of humour. Also, the game contains one of the best supporting game character names I've ever seen: Mkkt Bkkt the intergalactic drug dealer whose one single trade can render the whole crew of a space station useless. The name alone sells. All in all it is a fun game that is quite entertaining during the main mission but it doesn't start a revolution. Maybe a space trade sim doesn't need a deep story line like Mass Effect, who knows. As a gamer, I'd just happily see a space sim that changes the almost 30 years old Elite formula more boldly.","June 21, 2014","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Be a mercenary for hire, a pirate, a do-gooder, ... but keep in mind this is a game that was originally an iOS exclusive. There is indeed lots to do, but it's not terribly deep.","August 28, 2012","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Easily what I was looking for to scratch my space itch.\n\nVery good achievement value, happy with the graphic level from 2012. (2 most important things to me in space games)\n\nThe skill based mining makes ship upgrades a little more meaningful. Given I can see myself getting sick of mining.\n\nSo far im happy with the scope and size of the game, will add any negatives later but right now I dont really have any...\n\nWell auto pilot ran me into asteroids... and thats about it. So far the missions have been short and stress free, will see how the story plays out.","July 9, 2015","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They should have a local system of solar system you can go back and forth between where you fight the standard pirates, etc.  However, once you get jump ability you then go to new set of solar system where the enemies is more advance (I am tired of killing hundreds of these pirates – not getting any challenges).  I have 3 lasers as main weapon and lock on missile as 2nd with shield, armor and re-gen bot… seems rather boring after level 6 or so.  One of the missions makes you go across several systems without special drive, and come all the way back… if you get killed, you are going to do the whole mission again (be sure to save at each step).\n\nBuy the game on sale , play up to mission 11 and then quit…. At this point you will give a much higher rating to the game , if you continue, the negatives start to take over as you just keep seeing so many pirates that are too easy to kill and just slow down everything you are doing that is already becoming painfully repeatative!\n","April 22","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can climb up from very low to very high on tham with lots of work.\nI mostly satisfied with the controlling, I was confused only few times.\n\nOver all this is a nice game if you like missioning, mining and pew pew a lot.\nThis is not realy a sandbox game and not realy open world, but with the 30-34 system not far you can go.\nWith this content this game will not nail you to your PC for days but fun for several hours.\nWith high respect for the devs the ~13Euro is a bit too much, but if you can buy for some discount it can worth it.","May 16","true","33.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
