The graphics, is, well, not pretty. The gameplay is pretty fun, though, and if you are into Diablo-esque RPGs you may want to give it a try.\n\nTo those who are worried if Darkstone will run on their modern systems, it works perfectly on my Windows 7 without any readily apparent bugs or visual glitches. Though naturally, I canâ€™t vouch it will work for everyone, but steps to make this game work on modern systems were obviously taken (my old CD version stopped working ages ago).","September 26, 2014","true","18.6"," 337 of 352 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","337","352","3","13"

Seeing it here on steam actually made me excited since I hadn't played in FOREVER. Today is my second day with it and I'm already feeling the nostalgia, heh.\nAnyway, you play as 1 or 2 of 8 possible characters from 4 basic classes off to fight a necromancer (supposedly) who can change into a dragon, but you must acquire 7 crystals in order to make a powerful orb to help stop him first. This is where I find I love the game the most. Each crystal has around 3 or 4 possible quests randomly picked for it, so that's between 20-30 different combinations of quests you could have. Dungeons are randomly generated, so are monsters, loot, yadda yadda yadda, been there before. Yes, graphics are seriously outdated, but graphics don't make a game bad or good necessarily unless they're so abysmal you can't tell what you're looking at. The only problem I notice so far is that occasionally during dialogue, it tends to skip a little, but you can always check the "Previous Dialogue" tab to see what someone had said if you're playing without the subtitles.\nAll in all, this is a favorite of mine from childhood, one I recommend to people who like simpler RPGs that simply puts you as a hero out to fight an evil dragon/wizard/thing :P Doesn't need to be any more complex than THAT!","September 27, 2014","true","11.2"," 82 of 87 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","82","87","2","1"

It was one of the few games me and my friends would play together and I loved it.   Once I saw it on steam (and it was so cheap) I had to take a trip on the nostalgia train and play it again.  Only problem is, my graphics card and the game do not mesh well together...missing textures abound.   The trees that act as a border around the maps are just black shadow squares, my character's face is missing and NPCs are invisible unless they are in town (sometimes)   I went down to the first level of the dungeon and discovered my character as well as all the enemies and doors and items that dropped were invisible save for their shadows.\n\nI still recommend this game if you like dungeon crawlers, I loved it back then and I still do now...I just have to fix this graphical issue so I can enjoy the game to the fullest.\n\nEdit: When I wrote the review I hadn't googled the -sortbyz fix (and wasn't aware of where to put it) but after google and Norpal commenting on it, the game runs much much better.

The graphics are dated, but in a sort of endearing way, and have aged rather gracefully thanks to the cartoony style. In contrast to Diablo's grimdark oppressiveness the overall atmosphere in Darkstone is much more light-hearted and carefree, incredibly campy storyline (which the game never forces down your throat) and all.\n\nIn summary, Darkstone is an old hidden gem of a game that's still fun and fluently playable to this day, 15 years later. A great little ARPG for when you just want to bash some goblins and take their shiny things without having to worry about... well, much of anything, really.\n\n","September 27, 2014","true","1.5"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","42","49","2","0"

Was super disappointed when I couldn't launch the game AT ALL even with some of the fixes listed here on steam.\n\n== The only thing I had to change in the launch options was add "-32bit" ==\n\nI personally added "-nointro" as well, but that was just to skip the opening video.\n\nThey seem to have updated the game since I last played, adding a combat training area, a town guide, and voiceovers! Then again, I could've just forgotten about these features considering I haven't played this game in over a decade.\nThe PC controls are a little.... odd... but the gameplay works just fine with the point and click mechanics.\n\nThis isn't your typical WASD game. I find myself resting my left hand on right shift and arrow keys for combat toggle and camera controls while my right hand pilots the mouse for movement, targeting, and clicking the on screen buttons for inventory, map, etc.\n\nHaving a configurable gaming mouse helps as well as I can assign the numbers on the side to F1-F8 for quick item use on both characters.\n\nWhich reminds me of one last thing I really love about the updates! Party system! I remember only being able to play as one character at a time, but now you can have two characters in play! One you control and the other following behind (which can be toggled off for solo exploration). Combat for the follower can be set to automatic or manual, and you can switch between who you're actively playing as at any time.\n\nI don't know anything about co-op, but local co-op is something that seems to have been added as well.\n\nOverall I still love the game, though if you don't have that nostalgic attachment from your childhood the game may be a bit outdated.","March 5","true","2.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

You ask me why you should grab this game ? It's because Darkstone is just too awesome not to try to ;) You begin game by choosing one of four classes but every class has male and female character variation. After choosing your wanted character you start your game in small town of Darkstone. In town you can find weapons trader, healer, tavern where you can rest, bank, potions and magic stuff dealer, passive skill learner and even training facilities in which you can try every type of weapon and even magic spells. After you leave town all the goodness starts to happen :) Game villain is Draak the necromancer who can turn hinself into dragon and you need to collect 7 crystals in order to defeat him by combining them in time orb. Biggest game plus is what you don't have to play same content over and over again because there are three diferent variations of quest for every region you enter and that is just main quest :D There are also side quests like killing strong monsters or bringing back old relics of townpeople back to them.This game runs great on Windows 10 64bit FullHd resolution no aditional patches required also you can play it coop with your friend. So if you are not scared of outdated graphics but want to experience game of same goodness or even better than Diablo1 give it a try :) For me this game is even better than Diablo1 and i am shocked there is no Darkstone2.

There are no resolution options so everything was way too big on my 27" monitor. This is like playing an unpolished Diablo 1.\n\nHonestly, I remember liking this game back in the day, but it is just painful now. If you KNOW you will like this for nostalgia, get it on sale. Otherwise, my recommendation is avoid for everyone else.","January 2, 2015","false","0.1"," 8 of 38 people (21%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","21","8","38","5","0"

I recommended it to friends that use to roll with me back in the days. First time player: look up some gameplay videos before you buy it. I don't expect a patch any time soon but the game new some polishing or adjusments to new hardware/software becouse there are some issues that i've never seen before like lag, dark spots on textures and thing like that.","January 20, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think there are some improvements that could be made to the game to make it a little more compatible with modern pc's. The game does have a very good nostalgic feel to it and reminds me of the good old days of gaming on the PS1.\nEven with the couple of graphical glitches I experienced I would still recommend getting a copy of this game as it is really fun to play.","September 25, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The illustrations are well, not lovely. The gameplay is pretty fun however and on the off chance that you are into Diablo-esque RPGs you may need to try it out.\n\nTo the individuals who are concerned if Darkstone will keep running on their present day frameworks, it lives up to expectations flawlessly on my Windows 7 with no promptly obvious bugs or visual glitches. In spite of the fact that actually, I can't vouch it will work for everybody, except ventures to make this game take a shot at cutting edge frameworks were clearly taken (my old CD adaptation quit working a really long time prior).","September 29, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
