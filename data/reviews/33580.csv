So not a board game and should not be confused for one....\n\nBy building plantations with different crops you're trying to create enough wealth to get the best art collection. To make things intresting there's stock trading, an auction where you try to buy the paintings and scripted events from the historic timeline(early 19th century) that affect markets. For the paintings you also have the option of studying art directions so you can spot fakes. Or to raise price for your competitors who might not even realise what you're doing...

Then I see it comes in a bundle with two other games. This one, The Great Art Race, perked my interest a bit. Only in a bundle? Not for sale on it's own? It can't be that good then.\n\nMy mistake completely.\n\nWhat we have here is an extremely solid resource management/board game. Essentially you play as one of five nephews/nieces to a rich uncle, who is terminally ill and wishes one of you to inherit his fortune. The condition? Become insanely wealth and then use said wealth to attend art auctions in hopes of finding and retrieving his stolen artwork. And how does someone become insanely wealthy? By travelling to smaller cities like Bombay, Guatemala, Mexico City and Saint Louis, among others, and buying up land for plantations and hiring workers.\n\nThere's a pattern to the game. You visit your plantations and pay your workers, ship the goods to London or New York for sale, go to one of those cities to sell them at the market value or sign future dated contracts to sell them at a higher price, and then when all that is done you can find an auction to attend. No auctions? Maybe you can attend an activity for the exclusive social club you're all members of. Horse racing to bet on? Maybe take an expensive expedition in a foreign land in hopes of finding something valuable? Maybe visit your uncle and get drunk with him, or help him re-arrange his salon? This all raises your reputation which can result in you getting a bonus paining at the end of the year.\n\nMaybe you can attend an art class to determine if a painting is real or fake (basically allowing you to make sense of the included decoder file)\n\nThere are two game modes. The main one tasks you with locating the most paintings, with bonuses for all paintings of a series and for the aforementioned bonus paintings. The other tasks you with just having the most assets, with paintings adding to your overall value. Each one can be played against any combination of computer players or human players via hotseat. You can also set the difficulty, and set the length of the game to 2, 5, or 7 years.\n\nThere's a fair bit of depth here. It's quite fun all in all, even on your own. The music for the cities is catchy, and the colorful graphics and sound effects make it a pleasant audio and visual experience. Having not played either Darkstar One or Patrician III (the other games in the bundle) yet I cannot comment on them but The Great Art Race is so enjoyable it alone is worth the cost of the bundle.","November 30, 2015","true","8.9"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/33580/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1777 products in account","The Great Art Race is a light, simple, short, and casual strategy game. Once you develop a system for creating cash and being punctual to the auctions, it will be an almost effortless win even on the more advanced difficulty setting. There are some randomized events, but they will not effect the outcome very much. The graphics and presentation are not impressive at all, to say the least. There is very little animation, and minimal sound. It is fun for about two hours or so, keeping in mind there won't be very much of a replay value. Once you're done (and you'll be done quickly), there's not much to go back to. It somehow reminds me of a less fun Jones in the Fast Lane from the early 90s. I played for about 2 hours, and I plan on keeping it installed for the time being, just in case I feel like playing a quick "coffee break" game.\n\nThe Great Art Race is okay.","March 20, 2014","true","2.5"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

While flawed in some aspects, it is well worth grabbing if you are into management games. Specifically for this one, time management.\n\nThe players are the family of the wealthy art collector, explorer, and general high society member Uncle Walter. There are two problems, however. Firstly, your uncle is old. He is nearing the end of his life and is looking for an heir to his fortune. Secondly, his prized art collection has been stolen. All the paintings have gone missing, and are popping up at auctions.\nHe thusly decided that the one to bring back the most of his precious collection would be his heir.\n\nThis means it is up to you, and up to 4 other family members to get back those paintings. In order to get them you will need to start plantations, get yourself a fortune by producing up to five different crops and selling them in either London or New York. Prices fluctuate, and there are orders placed in advance you can fill for more profit. You can buy shares in the companies who transport these goods, and you can pay your opponent's workers to strike and stop working.\nAside from the economic things going on, you have a reputation to uphold. Explore the jungles, adventure in Asia, and bring back fancy figurines and other such interesting things. Bet on horse races, and of course spend time with your uncle before the end.\nAnd all of this while still making your way to auctions and having the money needed to buy the paintings.\n\nPaintings that could be forgeries. You can luckily take art classes to identify these(A PDF is included with the game, you will need it to check what is real and what is not), at which point you can bid up the price of a forgery if your opponents don't know it is one to make them lose out on money, or you can just let them outbid eachother for millions of dollars on what you know is a fake.\nThe gameplay is mainly about time management, rather than managing your business. Travel across the world is faster than in the age of sail, but it still takes several days to travel anywhere. And that adds up. You can only personally tell your warehouse to ship goods, so you need to be in India to send goods from there to London. And you can only personally pay your workers, but if you don't pay, they stop working. It is all about managing your time, and making sure you are in the right place at the right time while still having enough money to do what you need to do.\n\nThe greatest of flaws, aside from its age locking it at a smaller resolution than most screens and potentially making it difficult to get it working on some computers, is the multiplayer.\nBy which I mean, the AI are not too great at the game, and the only multiplayer is local multiplayer.\nIt would be a much more enjoyable game if it were one that could be played with friends over the internet.\n\nAs it is, The Great Art Race is an interesting, somewhat hidden game that is quick to play and finish (About an hour per ingame year), satisfying to get through, and yet leaves you wanting more of it. Assuming of course you can look past the small flaws and slight inconsistencies out there.","February 14","true","10.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Along the way you'll build up a global plantation empire, invest in stocks and hotels, participate in art auctions, and (of course!) sabotage your rivals.\n\nFor a game that was released in 2009 the graphics are very underwhelming. But graphics aren't everything, and I'll play anything as long as it has an interesting premise. This game's premise of being one of the wealthy elite during the Roaring Twenties appealed to me so I gave it a try.\n\nUnfortunately there are some flaws that cause this game to fail.\n\nFirstly, there is no in-game tutorial so I had to go hunting for the manual which I eventually found hidden in one of my steam directories. You really need to read the manual before starting the game, otherwise you won't have a clue how to get started.\n\nSecondly and most importantly, there are game-stopping bugs. I was running Windows 7 64 bit and had random crashes. I once made it two years into the game but then I got a crash that I couldn't avoid even using the auto-save, so that was it for me.\n\nIt's a shame, there's 95% of a game here, if they could have just done some more polish it could have been a decent resource management game. But since it came out in 2009 it's doubtful these bugs will be fixed, so I have to give it a thumbs down until further notice.","May 28, 2014","false","10.1"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

It's a great idea.  It completely lacks any sort of tutorial or guide, or pop-up hints, and some of the b.s. you have to deal with is just lamely frustrating, but that doesn't make the game bad.  It's fun to try, I'd like to try the multi-player.\nIf you're looking for a game to rip-off or plagerixe, this game would be a great starting point.  Re-theme it and tweak some things to make it better.","September 21, 2015","false","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Originally I got this game as a part of the Patriciants and Merchant bundle (The Great Art Race  + Darkstar One + Parician III).\n\nWhen I got into the game it suprised me positively. It's nothing world-changing, but it's a fun little game. An interesting blend of tabletop looks and strategy computer games. And has it's own depths too (to buy paintings you need money, witch comes from the plantations, wich need to be looked after, or else it stops producing for this or that reason, than to actually got the paint you have to travel to the auction and outbid the other players, etc...), though you has to get used to some of the game rules.\n\nBut it's still a pleasent option to kill some time with it, especially if you got only 5-10 minutes or half-an hour to do so. And maybe this is the game's only true problem. It's meant to be played in short bursts, otherwise it easily gets repetitive and tedious.\n\nStill, to those, who seek a game that is quick to pick up, easity to return to, with just the right amount of strategizing, very basic economy simulation and the simplistic, stylzied look of a tabletop game, this is the right call for them.","December 27, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is an interesting take on high level management in a high profit industry.\nYou travel the globe exploiting the locals for high profits. It is not a very in-depth simulation and would be very easy to play again with even better results.\nI class it similar to other buy/sell games a la drug wars, etc. It seems not very random which makes it easy to understand what you need to concentrate on to make a profit.\nAgain, recommended.","May 18, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do not usually play these anymore, but this has been great fun.  My only criticism is that it could have been more developed in terms of things like building up plantation towns, share fluctuations and opening up new areas.  The main focus of the game is making enough money to buy paintings to inherit your uncle's (meagre) fortune.  Tried playing it turn based with a guest and it worked very well for entertainment.  Might want to turn the game sounds down a bit as the choo choo gets a bit tired.","May 1","true","25.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays much like a board game with a computer screen as a board. If you like the board game Puerto Rico this incorporates many of the same aspects into the game play and competitiveness.\n\nThis game is cutthroat, seems balanced, and is quite replayable. If only I had more friends who would get into it, I'd play this game on weekend board games nights instead if choice were prestented.\n\nAnyway, point is, this is less about a race for art and more of a race for economy. time management, & cost analysis. It is fun, challenging, and the bots are brutally vicious.","May 29","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
