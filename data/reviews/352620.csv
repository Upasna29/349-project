This gamemode features an online leaderboard, there is much fun and competition to be had.\n\nWe would rate it a 7.5/10 as co-op experience, we would give the solo gameplay 6/10.\n\n- Sywick","May 21, 2015","true","1.5"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","18","21","3","0"

It's got high quality engineworks - no lags experienced at all! Action is all about adorable porcupines getting dramatically bald and now they fight for survival with one needle left each... you shoot it in the direction you move and the 2d pseudo-phisics here is totally allright! The point is you have to collect your shot back when it bounces off walls and falls somewhere, can't catch it mid-flight.. the most fun comes from occasionate suicides, when you kill 2 enemies with one shot, deflecting off two surfaces but weirdly the trajectory ends right in your own ars while you've been trying to evade the mole which has just popped out of the ground! It's lightning-quick, crazy random in a good sense and really feels nice, even singleplayer!\n\nПростая и чертовски быстрая стрелялка со стрельбой по направлению движения на арене с прекрасными отрисовкой, дизайном интерфейса и персонажей, и с подходящей музыкой (в стиле 8-бит, но очень мягкая, не утомляет). Движок высококачественен - торможения замечено не было! Действо происходит по поводу очаровательных дикообразов, трагически лысеющих, так что теперь они сражаются за выживание с одной оставшейся иглой на брата... стреляем по ходу движения, а двухмерная псевдофизика реализована на отлично! Фишка в том, что снаряд нужно забрать обратно там, где он упал после отскоков, поймать на лету не получится... самый прикол в неожиданных самоубийствах, когда дважды отскочив от поверхностей и убив двоих, траектория все-таки оканчивается прямо у героя в заднице, потому что он пытался увернуться от вылезшего из земли крота! Игра скоростная, в хорошем смысле полна случайностей, и весьма приятна, даже в одиночном режиме.","January 25","true","4.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","9","10","3","1"

Kinda in the same way it's easy to play but also quite challenging once you and your friends get good at it.\n\nIt's meant for 4-player gameplay, but I managed to have fun playing alone with the bots. There's a solo mode too with steam Leaderboards, which is nice. Menus overall could be better, yes, but the game really shines on gameplay.\n\nWill definitely keep playing it with my friends, goes great with beer :)","May 21, 2015","true","10.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","10","13","2","0"

Playing as a handful of near-balding porcupines, you must destroy all the baddies with one single, thankfully retrievable, super sharp quill. Your quill is a one shot masterpiece but you are just as susceptible too! I'm reminded of Titan Souls with that need to be as precise as possible and rebound shots are king here. I had a blast playing it as you can see in the video and I strongly recommend it, for yourself, for your friends, and for your inner violent porcupine! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yud4t0xzJvo","June 17, 2015","true","0.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Single player consists of killing enemies with your quill and collecting the skulls of your enemies while more enemies spawn. Try to get a high score on the leader board. Multiplayer has decent ai.. I found it kind of hard but I didnt play it very long.  you can play as teams with or without ai. Game has several maps with different gimmicks for each.\n\nAfter trying this game local co-op I think game equals morethan the sum of its parts... Or for lack of better words, It is very fun. It seems too simple when compared to some games but in the end it's pace and its mechanics work.","November 8, 2015","true","6.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"
