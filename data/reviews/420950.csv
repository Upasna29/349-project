Nor is it that the boobs grow about 5 extra cup sizes due to extra estrogen in such a short amount of time despite cells not being able to grow that fast even if they are cancerous. I seriously don’t mind it.\nMy problem with this games is that as a visual novel the user should have more choice but this game has only two and only one choice effects the ending in any significant way. So little choices basically make this a book and there are so many better books for me to read than this one. If there is going to be so little choice it must have a good story, a good story would have nice no matter what amount of choices were given, or else it is rubbish. Another alternative they could have done was do what hunie pop (which had no story to speak of) did and have mini games if they didn’t want to wreck the story or to keep a user interested. Sure the girls look good but their animation is average seriously there is better art work out there, but I guess I shouldn’t be too hard since this is Silver Cow’s first game and hopefully they learn from this and make a better game next time which is a sequel to this game.","November 20, 2015","false","4.6"," 282 of 379 people (74%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","74","282","379","60","8"

Do you like really big boobs? Well then this is the game for you. There's plenty of boobs, but the actual storyline ends on a cliffhanger right when it starts to pick up, with only a message announcing a sequel to be released in early 2016 to give you hope of seeing more boobs. It's not nearly as bad as I've learned to expect from an American visual novel, but it is a mostly kinetic novel, with only two choices placed near the very end of the game that don't really have any lasting effects, and I was able to see everything the game had in less than 3 hours, so it's probably better to wait for a sale for this one.

Being that I love big boobs and big boobs getting even bigger, I thought - well why not? As I found the art to look hot enough, even if it's not the greatest.\nAnd I have to say that some of the CG art looks a lot better (well at least to me) than what's shown in the screenshots here, but at the same time there are other pieces that look really bad (even worse than the screenshots).\n\nObviously, I bought it, and after only about 1 hour and 30 minutes, i was done with everything in it. As other reviewers have mentioned, the game only has 2 choices where only one has a real effect on the rest of the game. So it's not a "game" for anyone expecting a visual novel or a "game" pretty much. More like just fanservice for those like me who like fanservice.\n\nThere's not much to say about the story without "spoiling" it, short as it is. But simply said, it's pretty much just short and kinda weak. Though to be honest, it felt more like a "demo" rather than a complete game, with that sequel teaser at the end. But still, it wasn't awful, and with the CG images popping up every few minutes, it was at least able to keep me until the end.\n\nAnd the music was actually somewhat nice.\n\nIn the end, as a game and visual novel, I think I'd say it's bad.\n\nBut somehow, i kinda liked it anyways. I suppose that's because i found the two girls Kyo and Rose to be likable, and as I mentioned earlier, I myself found the artwork to look appealing.\n\nSo would I recommend this to everyone? No.\nBut if you're like me, finding the artwork to be appealing, don't really care if it's "bad" and simply just don't really expect anything from the "game", but still willing to pay like 10€?

It’s an obvious fanservice game, with giant boobs all over the place. But… It isn’t THAT bad? The background songs are really great, I’d buy this game’s soundtrack without hesitation. The art sometimes is nice, other times is weird and not… appealing. They should have kept the quality in all the CGs.\n\nAlso this game has almost zero interactivity (which isn’t that bad, I like those kind of visual novels too). Characters are plain and there’s no much depth in their personalities. Background images suffer the same thing like the CGs: sometimes they are nicely done, other times are just… meh. The story was a bit more “complex” than I expected for a game of this kind. There’s a few plot holes, but it’s fine.\n\n6/10. I gave an extra point because of the soundtrack to be honest. The game could be better, but it’s still fun to play (or “read”, haha :P).

About two and a half hours to go through. A good evening's worth of entertainment and story wasn't half bad. Wasn't sure what I was getting into with this but I'm happy with the purchase. Some of the art is a little off (nothing too bad, but as an artist specializing in 'mature' things I noticed some stuff, mostly easy fixes) and it started out very anime trope-ish, and of course there is fanservice, but it does propose some interesting questions and choices later in the game with a nice twist and multiple endings.

(But, I would have really liked if there HAD been, you know, similar interesting consequences to the time-travelling on Tenshi... Something unique could have been explored there, is what I'm saying.)\nThe quality of the art/pictures is pretty great, except for a few odd cases where the characters appear 'hand-drawn in a much lower quality'.\n\nOne thing of note though, as several people already mentioned :\nThe *severe* lack of choices, of being able to actually 'DO' anything- be 'involved' in the story. A lack of even simple ''artificial choices'', like being able to decide which girl to go talk to first/in what order you want to go talk to them(like in the beginning)... I seriously doubt this would have been something hard to implement, especially in such a game, yet it would have made a world of difference.\n\nSo, yeah, a game that is easy to like (especially if you are one of the MANY people with a soft spot/weakness for charming characters), but it really didn't have the weight it definitely could had have, if it had offered more real or artificial choices (and not just *barely* 2, right at the end, which really hurt replayability).\n\n(Oh, and one significant inconsistency I found : In the beginning, it's said that Tenshi was at the hospital for about 2weeks, after the house burning/parents' death, to insure he was 'ok' all around, yet he later says to Michelle that his parent died '3 days' ago.)","November 29, 2015","true","9.3"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","12","17","5","2"

While I'm sure that many people scoff at VN's, particularly these kinds, they're also just looking at the cover for the game and making up their opinions from there.\n\nI would not call this the best Visual Novel I've ever experienced. It is very abbreviated, it's plot feels very condensed and there's only two choices in the game near the very end. However, this VN has a lot of heart and charm to it, the characters are likable, understandable and charming, it has a decent amount of humor and is aware of itself.\n\nWhen one of the characters, Kyo (The girl with the aqua colored hair) goes out to shop with Kenji (The protagonist) she wears what looks like a black lingerie slip, which is what she usually wears, and I thought to myself, don't tell me you're wearing that outside, and Kenji mimics my thoughts and questions how she can wear it outside as well.\n\nIt is not just limited to being aware of itself in humor though, it also tries its best to address certain expected aspects of a game like this. While it doesn't do it in a deconstructive way or analyze it too deeply, it does go out of its way to make it so certain cliches are presented as realistically as it can and tries to address certain qualities of other VN's that people groan at. This doesn't mean it doesn't have its fanservice but it's clearly not supposed to just be about the fanservice, I've seen VN's that are, and I can certainly say that the creators of this game were not going for that.\n\nI recommend this game to people that want to support the creators. This is apparently their first game and I can see that they have potential to stretch out and get better at making VN's and that they do want to tell an interesting story while also having some goofy or fanservicy moments along the way. Most Visual Novels don't come over to America from across the sea and so I would be very happy to see more companies make them in my own country. But they need support to get to the point where we can get more complex stories and different genres. So please, if you want to see more VN's, give this one a shot, it doesn't cost much and its a pretty relaxed ride through the game.","December 5, 2015","true","10.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

And, once again, I have agreed to Satan's demands to the peril of my very soul.\n\nI played through this crime against human culture and, as usual, found myself disturbed and left wondering about the decline of civilization.\n\nRight so first we've got the usual: the shameless art -- huge ♥♥♥♥, ridiculous bodies, absolutely absurd dialogue between characters, a male protagonist who holds himself up for his 'honor/treating women with respect/being a nice guy/etc', and female characters who are just blown away by what a NICE GUY he is.\n\nAlso as usual, the game tries to build-in story reasons for the ridiculous scenes and artwork that it includes. To explain how stupid this is, I'll have to give a basic synopsis, so here goes:\n\nYour family's house burned down and they all died. Your grandfather decided to take you under his wing, so you head off with him to his laboratory, where, COINCIDENTALLY, 3 big-breasted young girls work as his assistants. WOW. WHAT A SURPRISE. Your grandfather, genius that he is, invents a time machine, and WHAT DO YOU KNOW, the time machine makes all the girls' breasts HUGE. SURPRISE. APPARENTLY TIME TRAVELING JUST WORKS THAT WAY HUH.\n\nOf course, and it couldn't be any other way, time traveling also makes them act seductive and sexual, huh, man, what an odd coincidence. Time traveling, apparently, just hugely increases estrogen or some ♥♥♥♥ like that? Yeah, I mean what're you going to do? Guess they'll just have to wear really skimpy outfits to accomodate their HUGE breasts. YEAH THAT'S THE PRACTICAL, OBVIOUS SOLUTION. CLEARLY.\n\nSo where does the game go with this premise? You know, I really couldn't tell you. The plot makes absolutely no sense and doesn't come to any clear conclusion by the end. The game tries really hard to play around with lots of profound, existential messages about fate, determinism, choice and consequence but, unsurprisingly enough, just ends up making no sense, falling flat, and making things that would normally be meaningful, meaningless.\n\nTrying to sum up what happens is rather difficult still, I can't get the sequence of events, shifting loyalties,  unclear conflicts between characters, motivations, or goals straight in my head at all. Seriously, it makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense, much as I tried to fill in the blanks where the game and the dialogue weren't clear at all.\n\nSo you and the girls go back in time to stop the evil corporate time travelers from screwing with time so they don't 'shatter reality or destroy time' or some ♥♥♥♥ like that? They do this by hitting them, which sends them back to the present? Of course, before they go back, their clothes disintegrate. Not kidding. They carry that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on for awhile, not advancing the plot.\n\nThen the bad corporate time travelers abduct you and take you to the future. They explain why they're actually the good guys, etc, blah, because the future is bleak and everyone died so they're trying to stop that from happening. Further, everything is determined so it doesn't matter anyway, you can't really change anything cause it's all set in stone, or not? They weren't clear on this.\n\nNaturally, the girls with the huge breasts come to rescue you, and, as it turns out, the stern, responsible girl of the three was apparently also the mastermind behind the corporate time-traveling girls? This is where it all really stops making any coherent sense. Following this we get scenes with 'oh you betrayed us how could you' where the motivations and goals of all the characters involved are still completely unknown to the player.\n\nShortly after this we're told that we have to make a choice: either kill our own family in burning our own house down or lose all memory of the past week/big breasted girls the protagonist met and potentially destroy reality. Why this choice is presented to you, why it has to be made, why you're being forced to make it, all of those pesky little questions of 3rd grade writing are left for, I don't know, never.\n\nSo you either kill your family and everything goes back to normal, the stern girl is fired and you go cry about the 'cruelty of time' with whichever of the two big breasted girls you picked. OR you don't kill your family and your timeline ceases to exist and you're sent back to your family, alive and well. On the same day, you're sent to the lab to help your grandfather and you meet all the big-breasted girls ANYWAYS and you all retain your memories of what happened for some reason?\n\nThe stern girl who compelled you to either kill/not kill your family gets sucked into the time machine and we're left on a cliffhanger if she comes out again? Apparently you've got to wait for the sequel to find out what happens in this riveting and well-written tale.\n\nHaving choices to make at all is pretty impressive for this genre of garbage we call VNs. Too bad those choices offered made no contextual sense in a story that was, also, complete nonsense. Add in the usual big breasts and shameless artwork and you've got a completely typical game for this genre.\n\nCongrats!

Despite that being in your face at the start, it's really just a side-dish to the time traveling plot. I liked the story, though it had flaws. Some of Chrontek's plan doesn't make any sense and their a moments where the characters lose all sense of logic and I'm left scratching my head over where their intelligence has gone. Still, I enjoyed it overall. The plot carried some some surprising depth to it that one generally wouldn't expect while judging the cover. Questioning morality and putting a choice in your hands that I was genuinely curious to see how both options played out. The characters are cute, silly, and fun, and fit the plot well.\n\nWhile the story is nice, imo, there is a lack of choices throughout the game that makes this far more a true "visual novel" then say an "Interactive novel" you might find elsewhere. However, I've also read some VN's that just provide an illusion of choice, making all of their options but one a simple "Game over", thus keeping you on a linear story anyway. At least Time Tenshi drops the pretense and just gives you the two options that matter for your particular story. As this is Silver Cow's first VN, the more linear nature of Time Tenshi is understandable. I personally enjoy more choices and hope to see more branching story arcs in the future as they acquire more resources to evolve their methods. As for Time Tenshi, it gave me a laugh and I look forward to reading the sequel! There is definitely a lot of setup for a continuing story here. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys a read of silly psudo-science and, of course, a view of heavily endowed anime girls.","February 18","true","4.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

Its nothing special that he censored you don't see anything much.\nThe story is boring(Not exciting, no real plot twist, finished everything in 71 minutes), and no real control of the plot plus it literally cuts off to say "buy part 2 to continue"... They better make that "Here is part 2 FOR FREE"\n\nAll I can say is I absolutely do not recommend this game to anyone interested in the Visual Novel gaming catagory.","February 26","false","1.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeonusStarwalker/recommended/420950/","LeonusStarwalker","Leonus Starwalker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeonusStarwalker/","172 products in account","About as basic as a smutty visual novel gets. The story is fine for the most part, the serious bits are interesting and keep you intrigued, the silly bits are as ridiculous as you would hope, and the sexy bits do their job fine enough. The art looks fine, if a little limited (specifically the characters state all the time how their breasts grow and shrink dramatically to different extents at different times, but since there's only 2 sizes for each character, both huge, it may as well not be in the story), and the music, while basic, usually suits the mood fine enough, although having more variety for the serious moments would do the game well. The game's only MAJOR flaw is a near complete lack of choice. You are only presented with two choices, both very close to the end of the game, and the one doesn't even do anything beyond slightly alter a few lines of dialogue.\n\nIn terms of less severe issues, one is that throughout the entire game, you are constantly praised for having the self control not to try anything with the girls despite the circumstances. The problem is that A. many of the times they praise you for self control you really had no opportunity to do anything if you wanted to, B. every situation was either so rapey you would have to be a sociopath to think what you did wasn't the only right choice, or so forceful on you that the only reason someone would decline in the situation is from genuine lack of desire, and C. the player has no choice in the matter anyway, so you aren't excercising self control, you're just reading text. It just ends up feeling like nonsense every time the characters bring it up.\n\nThe other issues come in at the very end, so skip to this paragraph if you care about spoilers. The final part of the game revolves around you having the option to prevent the event that caused you to be involved in the game in the first place, creating a time paradox, and what would happen if a paradox is created. Pretty basic time-travel stuff, but the problem is that rather than your interpherance being what prevents the event, you somehow were always the one who started it, and you go back in time to either cause it or not cause it, which means there's a freaking time paradox anyway! How the developers couldn't see that making it so you go back in time with the option to stop it from happening or letting it continue wasn't the more sensible choice baffles me. If you choose to continue with the status quo, you basically get a non-end where it feels like nothing even happens. If you choose to create the paradox, all the pre-concieved notions of how time travel works (which were flimsy at best to begin with) fall to pieces and next to nothing about the ending makes any sense, teasing that a sequel might explain what the hell just happened. Either way, the ending is less than stellar.\n\nOverall, if you've got a thing for breast enlargement, or are looking for a funny softcore hentai to laugh at or take seriously, you can certainly do worse than this game, but it's nothing to write home about. Buy it if it's your thing, youtube it or ignore it if it isn't.","November 20, 2015","true","1.7"," 17 of 44 people (39%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","39","17","44","3","0"

Granted art style did tend to very when it came to close ups but I found I ignored it and wanted to know the story more than the attraction they tried to play with and not much player choice was put into the game but i find it that with less choice there seems to be a big outcome which shows with little choice follows a bigger plot and story twist.
