The enemy AI is a complete joke, often times shouting at you to get your attention (and not actually firing at you). Your friendly AI teammates are dumb as dirt and will walk right in front of you while you are firing, get stuck on objects in various maps and otherwise prove useless in resolving a particular situation. There is also a game killing bug in mission eight “Distillery” where the screen goes black after a ladder is climbed early in the mission, preventing any further progress.","November 22, 2014","false","11.1"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","27","31","0","0"

Of course all of us Rainbow Six fans prefer the original titles with the planning phase and all, but despite the bad reviews I still believe Lockdown is a good game in itself. A decent shooter with an OK storyline, chasing down a terrorist cell with a bio agent threatening the world. (the usual Tom Clancy storyline, y'know.) The guns have a good amount of recoil and actually feel like they have a punch, unlike a lot of other shooters. The AI are a bit bad though. Especially your teamates. You're better off playing alone or cooperatively over LAN. The map designs are pretty clever and challenging for a first timer as well. And the graphics aren't that bad for a 2006 made game.

You have up to four team members at a time, and you issue fairly straightforward commands to them. They are fairly mindless and sometimes stand stupidly while being fired on. It's not so bad, though - the enemy does the exact same thing. Both of you are dealing with not-so-bright comrades so it all evens out.\n\nReally, the thing to remember in single player is that it is all a training mode for multi-player. You always get far better challenges playing against live humans than against computer-driven drones. So consider this your training grounds to get used to the commands. On one hand the game is a bit challenging - you can't survive infinite hits with a gun before you go down. It is much more realistic than many games in that sense. On the other hand, once you get even a basic grasp of how the tactics work, you should be able to rip through many of the missions without any need for cover or caution. The enemy is fairly clueless and you can usually kill them long before they start to take action.\n\nLockdown is worth a look and gives a solid decent amount play time, however people new to the series would be better to start on another Rainbow six game as this is certainly not a highlight of the series.\n","December 6, 2015","true","9.4"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","12","19","2","1"

The developers strayed away from an already working formula and experimented a little and ended up with this monstrosity. Kudos for trying to do something new but they done ♥♥♥♥ed up.\n\nCons:\n•	Lousy graphics\n•	Useless AI (both team and enemy)\n•	Lots of bugs\n•	Very limited character customization (you can choose between 4 different uniform colors)\n•	Multiplayer doesn’t work\n\nPros:\n•	Good selection of weapons and attachments (including a grenade launcher which is a first in the R6 series)\n•	Okay story\n•	Game isn't that short\n•	Stays faithful to some of the original characters from the R6 universe\n•	Gameplay is fun and challenging and it doesn’t get too repetitive\n\n\nAll in all it’s a below average FPS and if you're not an avid Rainbow Six fan boy then it’s not really worth buying.

I think a lot of the gameplay can be really fun but the story is basically not even a thing, John Clark explains most missions before you go in and it's so short and fast and you can't choose the crew that comes with you. I never got to play the multiplayer to this game because the servers are down.

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","As someone who wanted to revist the R6 franchise after years of an absence, I cannot believe I'm going to say this:\n\nI like this game. No, really, I adore this game.\n\nThis game is the most guilty pleasure I have ever found in a modern-military/tactical-shooter, and it's because it's so bad at being both a competent game and a MMS/TSS.\n\n"Charlie, Bravo; Alpha-Niner, R6 Over and Out..." "Wait, what just happened?"\nThe story is nonexistent with Tom Clancy's typical phobias of Cold War 2 and of Marxism terrorists going to take over the world with what's given in the PC version. There are no cutscenes in-between missions like the Xbox version, and for some reason this game is structured entirely different from the Xbox version.\n\nI don't think this story-method is inherently flawed. A game that puts you into missions with concise briefings can be an interesting way to tell a story in this genre. With actual characters and time to talk things over with your teammates for quiet time, I think you can pull twists off and engage the player than any dumb modern-military shooter.\n\nAs I played the game I felt like a cadet given the scrapest of intel and told to get the job done with lives resting in my hands (which would live for tomorrow whether they died ro not in the mission). These intel could be better utilized to figure out choke-points or learn more about the R6 Heads by what they don't tell you in black-marks or hide in the briefings vs. the debriefings.\n\nHonestly, I'd love for a MMS to do this narrative justice. Or maybe an anti-war game would be better given the quality of game stories that genre has made.\n\nIf it Ain't Broken... Doesn't Make up For What Is\nWhat works in this game is actually surprising.\n\nFor starters, the level-design feels quite nice and colorful. There are a variety of settings that each keep the corridor shooters just slightly more interesting to keep playing.\n\nYou have desserty middle eastern places, universities, caves, bunkers, urban areas, hospitals, morgues, catacombs, junglely areas and more. A lot of these areas are typical for MMS, and yet the level design and color palatte feel refreshing.\n\nThe aesthetic and detail of the game also reminds me of FEAR with the lighting effects and the reference humor on the walls. Ubisoft games, fake ads, fake product placement and more that made me question why were they here in the first place. The game's environments and gun-models look great still for today, but the humans all look like abominations of early 3D gaming.\n\nEverything else about this game... is godawful.\n\nThe AI, whether your squad(s) or the enemies are hilarious to watch in their failure. Your AI will clear rooms walking backwards into gunfire; the enemies will spray their guns toward you moving them left-to-right like Rambo, and yet missing you all the time; your AI will flashbang themselves when breaching a room; the enemies will run around you at times to find the right spot to die at; your AI will stay "in cover" while the enemies are filling him/her with holes behind him/her or shooting him/her at an angle.\n\nAs much as I save-scummed my way through this terrible, TERRIBLE game, I chuckled all the way through with how serious the situations were contrasted with the game's AI. It is almost self-aware.\n\nThe gunplay is all right, I suppose, but the guns are all cosmetic and audio differences, and the default loadouts are decent enough to get your through the game. I varied up my guns because you can only stick with the loadout you are given at the start, so be sure to have plenty of ammo for the situationis.\n\nGlitches galore, and random moments plague this game worse than any Ubisoft game released in 2014. And it's still not patched.\n\nYou Done F*CKED Up\nI got my money's worth out of this game with just the single-player shennanigans. Almost. On Mission 15, however, the game infuriated me to stop.\n\nYou see, there's an area where an enemy is directly at the ladder where you need to drop down . If you don't have a grenade to kill him, it's game-over; there is no way to lure him up, shoot him from above, or send your squad-mates to kill him. And this is the third section of the level, so you'll have to restart the entire mission. Oh joy..\n\nPutting that game-breaking design-desicion aside, I wanna recommend this game ONLY if you buy this game as a part of the R6 pack on a steep Steam sale and you want a jarring experience for a mechanically sufficient tactical shooter with the dumbest AI I have ever played with in all FPSs.","June 24, 2015","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While lacking the more linear style levels of the console counterpart, the PC version of Lockdown has larger levels, more open levels (still not as large and open-ended as Rainbow Six 3's, or its predecessors).  The gunplay is very strange, it feels like a mix between Counter Strike and Rainbow Six 3, where your character is swift and nimble, but fire-fights are still extremely deadly and tactics and strategy are still required to overcome enemies.  I'd say that the sound design exceeds Rainbow Six 3's, along with the level design, although the gameplay is much more fast paced.\n\nNo longer are you carefully planning your movements and decisions before striking your targets, as this is more about cover-based shooting.  Commanding your squad takes a back seat to the action and its relegated more to a standard FPS with the Rainbow Six skin on it, but lacks the elements that truly made it Rainbow Six.  If you're not a purist, you'll be able to find some joy in it, as it's not broken, plays very smoothly, and is made very competently, the only problem is the design behind most of it where it's trying to be a tactical shooter, but lacks the dedication to really commit to the genre.","May 3","true","2.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It actually was made for consoles first, in 2005 by Red Storm. It would then be ported to PC in 2006, apparently reworked somewhat. But not enough, thus you still control only one squad and there is no planning stage. But hey, look at those helmets on rainbow six characters! Apparently, that was number one complaint from fans about console version. Quite a priority.\nIt also was released on Xbox, Gamecube and PS2. Yea, they are different enough from PC, at least levels aren't all that same.\n\nAlso, I think that this is v1.0 version, while there exist a v1.1 patch. But it only seems to fix multiplayer things.\n\nMultiplayer community here is quite dead. Actually, online multiplayer servers are dead. Ubisoft shut them down. Some say that they could login with UPlay account, didn't work for me last time I tried. But oh well, still can use some programs, you know them.\n\nAnd well, what can I say. The game got literally "consolized", as much as I hate this term. No planning. Only one squad. You can play only as main hero. Everybody has huge health now, unless headshot. Infinite pistol ammo, even though it makes sense gameplay-wise. Game became nothing more but a generic lame action realistical shooter that we had more than enough in 2000s. To be honest, Rainbow Six ports on consoles already had similar thing going for them, but it's the first time developers decided to bring this to PC where it's not really needed.\n\nWhich wouldn't be so bad had AI had not been so terrible. I am mostly talking about teammates AI. If you take a look at their AI separate from gameplay, then it's quite an improvement, as they learned to take cover and peek around corners, instead of just following you in straight line. But once you actually play it, then oh boy. They have messed up priority, ignoring terrorist with shotgun, they are often incompetent with their shooting and they can be way too happy to rush forward, often getting headshotted by you.\n\nHostages also are quite horrific to deal with. They seem to have same AI as teammates, happy to rush into next room and take cover. Heck, they are annoying like no other tactical game ever had, as policeman hostages would whine "police, here!" and "somebody help me!" while following you.\n\nAnd you don't have as much tactics anymore. After all, you control only one squad, not even individual members. And with their horrible AI, you are pretty much a lone wolf with few lives walking behind you. The only times that they matter is that they can take orders on how to enter through the door. Shotgun, hammer, breach, grenades. They still screw up grenades, which also aren't as good as used to be either, as flashbang works like grenade that stuns, with small radius. And even then, teammates may die embarresingly during cleaning of room, easily.\n\nSince there is little left of tactical part, they could at least make action really good. But nope. Developers decided that PC audience are some crazy hardcore people who hate any story or cutscenes fluff with all their heart and removed it pretty much in this version of a game. We don't even get intel to pick up anymore in these linear levels, so exploration feels empty, as tehre are no pickups at all. Which harms level design that is linear with some pathways.\n\nNot to mention that you will easily blast through the game as it now allows quickscamming of save and loading. And motion detecter with regenerative battery, which I abused heavily.\n\nAlso, yea, it also includes modes like Terrorist Hunt, Terrorist Hunt in reverse map, Lone Wolf. Barely noticed difference. And multiplayer, which is dead, so no commers.\n\nOverall, a game on PC that lacks on both tactical and action fun. Just a generic realisticalish lame shooter.","May 30","false","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

If there is one thing that I am not a fan of, it is the fact that intel will not tell you where tangos will possibly be, so you are essentially going in blind, which does encourage you to be more slow and aware of your surroundings, but knowing more about the layout of the mission is something that I liked about the original games.
