No robots to beat though.\n\nYou do get at times a great sense of speed but that speed is halted at every turn as you don't generate almost any momentum and just stop dead at even very small angled inclines.\n\nThe animation on Luna is just hilariously bad, in the cutscenes she is basically a stick figure.\n\nThe level design and the environments are equally bad.\nIt reminds of NES era games where there were platforms only for the reason that you can jump on top of them, this makes them feel out of place.\nI mean why are there floating rocks in this cavern? Are they magic? Is something holding them up?\nNo they are just there, floating,  without logic or reason.\n\nThe only good thing I can say about the game is the music.\nIt is actually quite pleasant.\n\nThe game needs a lot of polish, in almost every regard.\n\nIf you wish to see some gameplay then check out the video above and below:\nhttps://youtu.be/P3gP19CEdxk\n\n(Edit 5.10.2015)\n\nTwo patches have been released to the game in order to do something to the controls.\nI can say that it's a bit better when compared to the launch state, but there's still work to be done.","October 2, 2015","false","1.2"," 44 of 61 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","44","61","3","3"

The sound and music scapes really are exceptional, and immerse you into the expansive landscapes. The visual effects are rewarding. Each level seems to test a different aspect of the 2.5D gameplay.","October 23, 2015","true","2.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

The music is very relaxing and the gameplay is fairly straight-forward. I like the sense of speed you get when running down a slope to pick up crystals. I did have a couple instances when my frame rate would drop for a split-second.

That alone warrants a recommendation for purchase. Still, $12.99 is a bit steep. I've got to say wait for a sale or bundle, or if the price is lowered a bit.\n\nI was honestly presently surprised with this game, and even though it's not the most polished thing out there, I can't wait to go back and finish it. A lot of fun for anyone who likes something "similar" to an old school Sonic game.","April 12","true","0.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

But am I compelled to say "you gotta see this!!" to anyone else? Not really.\nFull Review: http://gonewiththewin.com/luna-sky-so-bad-hopefully-wont-be-seen-again-for-38-years/\n\nLuna Sky is a below average platformer after patches. Still has numerous little quirks, its not a bad game, its not revolutionary in any way, it's a Sonic clone with little new elements to offer. Still the game's controls are improved, visuals are pleasing, and the kind of game platform fans will probably enjoy for a moment, then quickly forget about. Feels still like an unfinished game, that was once brimming with potential. Lack of enemies. Lack of dangerous elements. With only the possibility of falling off the same platform 10 times, leaves you with little reason to return and help Luna on her quest","October 12, 2015","false","1.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"
