Blaze Epic created a game that is progressively more challenging as you progress through the game, although difficult to master\nwhere eventually you have to solve puzzles while defeating enemies and doesn't follow the linear game structure making it hard to predict future events. The game has controller support if you want to play the game in a living room environment or if you are used to the feel of a console controller. If you want a short small sized game that would last 2-3 hours of gameplay that is full of action and adventure then this is the game for you. At the low price tag, this game is a steal, even when it is not on sale.\n\n*Please do note that I have received this game for the purpose of reviewing it*","May 28","true","2.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You play as a ninja with a katana moving from one screen to the next while clearing out enemies and dodging spikes and sawblades (so many sawblades)\n\nThere's no defined plot in the game, other than a text monologue that appears between stages, which I'm still unsure as to what relevance that had to the game itself.\n\nThere are bosses at the end of every stage, which are more like upgraded enemies. It's not hard to figure out their attack patterns and win. On one boss, I was able to mash attack and run into him to win.\n\nYou can also abuse(?) attacking in the air to slow yourself down while falling, taking some challenge out of the platforming. It's saved me from death a few times.\n\nOverall, it's $2, and it's good for 2 or so hours, so I can't complain.","March 17","true","2.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zazzzel/recommended/454130/","zazzzel","陳先生","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zazzzel/","289 products in account","A rōnin was a title given to a samurai who, upon the death of their master decided to go rogue instead of committing seppuku during the feudal period of Japan.  The other samurais would banish and exclude a rōnin, isolating them from their groups.  In the modern world, the word can be used in comparison to a person who has trouble fitting into certain social groups; always wandering around, searching for a place to be at ease.\n\nOverview\nNil-Ninjahstic: Ronin combines the elements of wandering samurai into a platformer.  Essentially a derivative of super meat boy without all the crazy speeding and sliding, you play as an outcast of society, where you’re always picked to do the dirty tasks that no one else wants to do.  As such in this game, you are put through a ‘test’ where everything and everyone tries to kill you.  In order to pass this initiation, players will need to run, jump and slash through 5 chapters of increasingly difficult levels of platforms and their respective level bosses.\n\nThe Good\nBeing the third game in the series of Nil-Ninjahtic, the most well done part of the game is the control scheme in relation to character movement.  Blaze Epic has mastered the basic controls for the game throughout 7 games and the result is a smooth and polished feel.  The character does not move to fast and is extremely responsive in terms of fluidity.  Air strafing is done extremely well and allows for predictable pathing and enables speed runs.\n\nThe alternative to running past everything would be to slow chip your way through a level.  Blaze Epic has provided the tools necessary to accommodate for this playstyle by incorporating a sword slash function and block.  Block stops most projectiles and melee attacks, while allowing you to strafe in a direction with no real penalty except moving slower and being unable to turn.  However, it comes at the cost of being not able to counterattack, and limits your movement by restricting the use of block while in midair.\n\nNil-Ninjahtic Ronin might not have the best music around, but it serves its purpose extremely well.  Since there is no auditory feedback from enemies in the game, Nil-Ninjahtic Ronin can afford to play the role of metronome and pace the game for the player.  Entering different areas of the game whether it be in the streets of Japan, or in the locker room of a gym, will change the music to suit the appropriate setting, a feature not usually found in smaller platformer games.\n\n\nThe Bad\nNil-Ninjahtic: Ronin is a five chapter game with many levels in between.  However, the most obvious flaw is that it only saves at the end of a chapter.  In order to save your progress, one must completely the whole chapter completely.  Since this game’s skill requirements are quite high, players may find it difficult to find the time or even the abilities to make it to the next chapters.  Implementing checkpoint saves between each sub-chapter would allow for greater re-playability and would make the game feel more complete in a sense.\n\nThough the game’s difficulty increases at a reasonable rate, the game gets pretty frustrating in chapter five where the game slowly becomes more of a chore.  I cannot fathom the amount of times I was so close to completing a level only to accidentally run back into the previous screen, resetting all the progress on the current level, or running through the most annoying chainsaw run only to be slashed down by an edge-guarding samurai on the last platform.\n\nAnother huge flaw is the fact that the chapters are also too long, with no dialogue in between the smaller sub-chapters.  The small bits of monologue between the chapters feel out of place and only serve to string the game together.  The writing is not that interesting to begin with and by the time you finish a chapter, you will have difficulty remembering what the story was talking about already.\n\nNil-Ninjahtic: Ronin not only test your skills, but also your patience as seen with its pixel perfect platforming.  Jumping horizontally into a wall will result in your character bouncing off, but jumping vertically into the ceiling will allow your character’s head to clip through it.  I personally found this out after spending a good 15 minutes trying avoid spikes in a tunnel, thinking I would bounce off the ceiling and die to the buzz saw below.\n\n\nOverall Score\nI personally rate this game 7/10 for the really fun gameplay.  Like all good things come in moderation, this game is best enjoyed in short bursts of 1-2 hours, just enough to completely one chapter each time.  This works to keep the game from getting too repetitive, too quickly. Had the game included checkpoints between the sub-levels and had more consistent art, it would have been a solid 8/10.\n\n\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways please visit  Steamified [www.steamified.com].

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/454130/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Two dollars isn’t a lot of money in this day and age. But that amount of money can get you one of the coolest new games on Steam. I’m not even kidding. Blaze Epic’s new Nil-Ninjahtic: Ronin is as addictive and sweet as low budget indie titles can possibly be. Cute and charming, tight and exciting. It’s a precision platformer that plays a lot more energetically and easily (not necessarily in terms of difficulty) than a lot of its peers, the Nil-Ninja has swept me off of my feet.\n\nNil-Ninjahtic: Ronin is the third in a franchise of games developed by Blaze Epic – a one man developer, Larry Stover, – who was previously a musician and now has turned his hand to game development. The first two games in the franchise are Ninjahtic and Ninjahtic Mind Tricks. Sadly, even though both of them have been bundled twice they had gone completely under my radar. However, now that I have had an opportunity to play this game I am definitely interested in playing the first two games in the series.\n\nWhat stands out to me with this game is its accessibility as well as charming 8-bit style and outstanding artwork. First, I don’t find these types of platform games to be accessible to as many people as what most developers would like to think that they are. First, the games are often too difficult – intentionally so – and are often rage inducing to the more advanced gamer so spare a thought to the people who just want to have a bit of a play around and enjoy their spare time playing something that they actually stand half a chance to be successful at. Yes, you can develop your skills over time but many gamers are time poor and thus  learning how to play a game such as this isn’t always a viable decision. However, I do believe that this game and perhaps even the series may prove to be a great gateway to these types of games. When you’ve become successful at this game you can move onto your more well known yet tougher challenges.\n\nI truly do appreciate the artwork. I know that not everybody is a fan of 8-bit artwork but when a developer does a good job of it and it is pleasing on the eye then you’re in for a delightful experience and that’s what has happened here. It gives the game quite a bit of charm and it takes me back to the 8-bit era more successfully than many other games. This is the type of game that I would have adored back when the Commodore 64 was my primary gaming device which it was throughout the mid-to-late 1980’s. While that may be lost on younger gamers us oldies can truly appreciate it and I hope that the younger game historians among us can too.\n\nSpecifically I enjoyed the fact that there is unlimited lives and that the checkpoints come at the beginning of the next screen. That makes the game less punishing than what otherwise would be the case and again is a statement for just how accessible the game is. You never feel robbed of progress and you can only ever advance when you’re good enough to successfully complete the set of challenges that each level provides. It means that as you improve the game becomes more challenging and consequentially you can feel both – that you’ve improved and that the game is harder.\n\nIn all, this is a really well designed game that offers players both a challenge and a way to learn how to play games in this genre. It’s accessible, fun and full of charm. For under $2 you need to own this game.\n\nNow, if you’ll excuse me I have to at least try the first two games in the franchise out.\n\nFor our epic giveaways and similar reviews head to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo join in our fantastic community join our Steam group\n","March 26","true","15.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Still retaining that great music from the previous games, fun parkour sections, fair difficulty, and style. i have some gripes about it though. First, the new stage system is an ok idea on paper, but doesnt work as well in the game, when you select a stage it takes you to the start of the stage, the problem is that if you need to go somewhere or close the game, all the stuff you went through to get far into the stage is worth nothing becuase you cant simply save. secondly, yes some music tracks return but i see a lack of new ones and this might be becuase there very forgetable which is a shame cus you can make really good tracks. finally, combat was a big part of ninjhatic mind tricks, and i liked how you tried to combine it with the older style of gameplay, but it favors the original more than mind tricks. you can't attack up or down which sucks when you need to attack enemies when hanging on a ledge, and you only take one hit no matter what! getting hit multiple times allowed you to not get ♥♥♥♥ed over by that one enemy in front of the door and made combat a bit more enjoyable, 2 hits would be perfectly fine, we dont need 5 hits or whatever it was in mind tricks.\n\nbut other than that everything is perfect! (note i didnt beat the game when i wrote this review)\n9/10!","May 9","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
