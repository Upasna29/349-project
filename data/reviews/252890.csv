But it is so, so charming - you know with the charm of B movies: naive, cute, full of hilarious dialogs, overdone accents and caricature characters.\n\nThe voice acting makes this game unforgetable, it is so ironically bad (I am sorry, actors) that it is almost spectacular. Igor is a star of this game, I bet he will be your favourite character and all his phrases will put a big smile on your face.\n\nThe game itself is a point & click adventure with tons of puzzles and mini-games. The puzzle part is interesting and pretty challenging. Some of the puzzles confused me and I was close to rage quit (but I guess it is because I am too impatient).\n\nArt is really pleasant here, locations with hidden objects are drawn beautifully, every detail is carefully designed.\n\nAchievements are fun and interesting to do. Verdict - time well spent!\nDracula: Love Kills is a lovely puzzle game, seasoned with plenty of irony, fake transilvanian accent and one hardcore decision - to bite or not to bite.","March 31, 2014","true","19.2"," 60 of 70 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","60","70","0","31"

I really enjoyed playing it because it is very user friendly: the game is designed to help you understand what you are supposed to do next, without spoiling the fun or the story.\n\nApart from the common elements that appear in every hidden object game (hints, difficulty levels, extras) the game offers a tutorial / strategy guide which is very helpful for players that are new to this type of game. The game also shows when a location is complete, thus making the game experience very enjoyable since you don't waste time any more looking for clues in the locations that you've already visited.\n\nMost of the puzzles have a medium difficulty, some are very easy and intuitive, but there are a few brain teasers that will surely challenge your logic and patience.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","July 6, 2014","true","17.4"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","1"

For fans of Hidden Object Games, this is actually a very competent, polished and enjoyable game of the genre.\n\nYes, yes, the story is ridiculous and oh wow, that's some pretty horrendous voice acting. Then again I suppose it all ends up being entertainigly bad in B movie way (read: standard HOG fare). However I haven't enjoyed HOG scenes so much in a while. The art of the backdrops is very good, items are well drawn, the compositions are intelligent, and the difficulty was pitch perfect for my personal tastes. The puzzles offer a nice amount of variety, and the occasional bit of novelty. A few of them are based on board games, which was fine by me. And while most puzzles are of medium difficulty, there were a couple that demanded some attention, mostly in a good way. Bonus points for the fact that everything is skippable.\n\nNavigation is easy with the higlighted maps (a really big plus), the music rather forgettable but not bad, and between the extra gameplay and all the puzzles and HOG scenes offered seperately as extras in the end, there's a decent amount of content here for the usual price. It's also technically competent, with all resolutions offered and without any obvious bugs or glitches - and this is unfortunately notable for casual games.\n\nFor fans who understand what to expect this is a very easy recommendation.","August 12, 2015","true","6.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

They're in every store that has computer software. Somewhere in the far reaches of the software isle, all priced at 9.99. Steam has plenty, Big Fish has hundreds. They're everywhere. My wife and I have played a good chunk of them. This one stands out as better then your average.\n\nNote: This review is for those familiar with hidden object games\n\nThe puzzles are basically what you'd expect, with a few nice surprises. There are too many tile puzzles in my opinion, but not enough to spoil the process.\n\nVisually stimulating for a hidden object game, with nice backdrops.\n\nThe story/voice acting is pretty bad, as you could have guessed anyway.\n\nThe objects aren't blurry or difficult to find. Resolution is solid.\n\nWhile mostly what you'd expect from a more "modern" hidden object, this one is polished. It's not clunky in navigation, the puzzles work great, and its very vivid. There's enough here to say this is one of the most polished I've played in quite some time.\n\nBottom Line: If you want a crisp hidden object game, mostly containing what you would expect with puzzles/story, but doing it very well, this should fit the bill. You'll enjoy it.","July 31, 2014","true","8.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

It is very good made and has acceptable voice acting. The Art was absolutly lovely and the puzzles where rather challenging.\n\nThis Game comes with some Bonus Content as well which makes it even longer. The Actual Base Game & Story is around 6-10 hours long. Depending on how quick you are with the puzzles and the Bonus Content is around 2-5 hours long. Yet again it depends how quick you are with the puzzles.\n\nThere are no Guides for this Game so if you want to get it a perfect one you will have to either way figure it out yourself or google it (same goes to when your stuck).\n\nIn my opinion there is hardly any good vampire games out on Steam but this is definitly one of them. It is a must for every HO / Point & Click Games Fan and of course for every Vampire Fan too.\n\nDue to the Fact that this Game is all in all over 15 hours long I can recommend it for its original price but if you decide to get it on sale you will be probably even more happy!\n\nThe Only thing which I found a bit sad was that there is no trading cards. Hopefully they will add them in later on at some point.\n\nFor Achievement Hunters: If you put alot of effort in it and be patient you might as well get 100% quite easly.\n\nThank you very much to [ReAp]Mr.Tech for the Gift!","November 25, 2015","true","8.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","1"

Vampire fans may enjoy it, but casual players and achievement hunters will have their patience tested to or beyond the limits.\n\nLong version:Dracula: Love Kills is an average hidden object puzzle game with a lot of scavenging: gameplay mostly consists of gathering fragments from maps or hidden object scenes that are assembled into puzzles which are solved to get even more fragments. Repeat until the credits roll– although it often feels as if that moment will never come.\n\nThere isn’t even a good story to save it. It’s a sequel to the original novel using the classic movie cast (completed with terrible accents), where Dracula and his reluctant helper, Van Helsing have to travel all over the world to save Mina Harker from the Queen of the Vampires. The plot just repeats itself numerous times and the nonsensical level progression quickly kills the atmosphere.\n\nFrankly, you’ll find a better deal in the developer’s other title they put on Steam: Sherlock Holmes and the Hound of the Baskervilles. A superior game in every possible aspect.","January 20, 2015","true","8.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

And as ever, the inner perfectionist got the better of me and demanded of me to achieve all there is to achieve. So there we are.\n\nAside from a small glitch that I lost one of my achievements just before I would have completed all, thus having to play the entire game plus extra game a third time, it was plenty of fun. The storyline is not too overloaded, but it also is a very clear line. And you even have a moral choice here. It is nothing as deep and imersive as Mass Effect or similar Triple-A titles, but it does get across a point. At least for me.\n\nThe graphics, the music and the atmosphere of the game all harmonize perfectly. To me, "Dracula: Love Kills" is one of the most enjoyable point and click adventures with Hidden Object and Puzzle elements out there. And now, after playing it straight for several hours today, I will fall into bed and pass out to have some well-earned sleep.","February 18, 2015","true","16.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There is a bonus chapter along with replayable hidden object scenes and mini-games/puzzles.  Voice acting isn't that great, but I've heard worse.  Your character learns powers that allow slightly different interaction with some objects, so you must identify where to use them and which one (if you choose the wrong one it just won't allow you to use it, so you don't waste anything by trying).

A simple 'world being haunted by evil witch and we gotta save the princess and the world', with mediocre voice actors and OSTs. I'm glad I didn't fall asleep when playing the game because of them.... Then again it's not the main focus, so you can as well disregard it.\n\nThe point and click adventure is the same you find on other games like The Walking Dead. You find an object like keys, use them to unlock the doors somewhere to get another items to unlock another places. During the process you'll encounter a hidden object mini-games that upon completion reward you with the items necessary to continue the journey. Progressing further into the game, you'll unlock special powers for the Count Dracula so he can shapeshift as a bat, has telekinesis power and all seeing eye (Sauron? heh...) that help you to access certain areas the obstacles or see invisible stuffs.\n\nSome of the mini games are complicated enough and/or have vague helps/hints but there's an in-game strategy guide, so if you get stuck you can refer to it. You can also skip puzzles after spending certain amount in-puzzle without solving it.\n\nThe game as a whole is so-so - not that bad but not that good. For 5 hours long single playthrough, at least.

Comparing the two however, this title seems lacking. Unfortunately, this game also contains a lot of hidden object "puzzles", even more so than the aforementioned title. Getting through them ends up a chore and annoying when you cannot find an item that more often than not is very hard to see even if you know what you are looking at. The puzzles are similar and they are of adequate difficulty and variety. Whether to a somewhat different pallete,the graphics seem a bit worse, with environments being dull rather than bleak and the models for the few characters appearing being uninteresting.\n\nAll those could be looked over by someone with some spare time in his hands who is just looking for a quick adventure game to play. However, add on top of that the ridiculous scenario, annoying "comic relief" Igor and mediocre at best voice acting, are dooming this game. For all the flaws of the previous installment, Dracula: Origin, it was at least a story that you could take seriously and follow on. The story of Dracula: Love Kills seems as if thought up a few days before release, it is completely unimaginative and uninteresting. Replayability is not good either, doing a second run for achievements seemed for like a chore and I was able to breeze through it in about 2 hours on easy mode, realising most of the game time is spend in hidden object "puzzles".\n\nFor adventure and Dracula fans, avoid. This title is simply not worth it, even as part of a bundle as I got it, I wish something of better quality had taken its place.","July 16, 2014","false","10.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

However, I have enjoyed many "point and click" adventure games in which hidden-object scenes appear every so often.\n\nI would consider Dracula: Love Kills as an adventure game with an abundance of varied puzzles as well as hidden object scenes. It's not a pure hidden-object game. While it started off in an interesting manner, and while it indeed has many challenging puzzles, I cannot recommend the game, because I feel it completely lacks any atmosphere. As a result, getting to the end of the game felt like a monotonous chore.\n\nWhat do I mean when I say lacking in atmosphere? Well, I found the storyline and character interaction/progression absurd, and most importantly, I felt like the developers just lumped in a bunch of random objects to form hidden object scenes -- random objects which have no place being there, given the time period and locale (Example: objects of Chinese origin within a medieval tomb). It made the entire game feel rather tacky.\n\nDracula: Love Kills isn't an awful game, and I think the developers did quite well in coming up with some of the original puzzles. However, I think there's many higher quality "casual adventure games" out there (Azada and Nightmare Adventures: The Witch's Prison are two games that I recall having an engaging atmosphere and storyline).","January 4, 2014","false","5.5"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

The format, while still familiar, is a welcome break from the cookie-cutter puzzle/HO products that populate the market. Not only are the HO scenes well crafted (they rely on clever or innocuous placement of objects rather than the common cop-outs of fading or obscuring them), but the progression sequences also, while heavy on the collection of item sets for puzzles, at least tend to make consistent sense, as opposed to all those games in which you might be asked to forgo your crowbar and find the tiny key to that oh-so-shatterable glass cabinet. Indeed, the general flow of the story is far more linear and logical than the winding, obtuse, quasi-Wonderland adventures into which we are so often flung. The puzzles are mostly in the same vein of those you'd find anywhere, but a sprinkling of fresh ones (a version of the game Connect Four, for example) keeps them interesting. The most unique addition is the inclusion of vampiric powers - fueled, naturally, by imbibing blood - which act as keys to otherwise inaccessible items.\n\nThe big problems here are the game's storytelling, attempts at roleplay, and sheer repetition. The interpretation of the supposed source material (the Bram Stoker novel) is downright laughable when it isn't simply cringeworthy. Dracula himself looks like he was scanned from the cover of a bad romance novel, and sounds - I kid you not - like Antonio Banderas; Van Helsing, an unassuming Dutchman in the book, is rendered as an imposing English noble with a fashion sense ironically more akin to what we traditionally associate with the titular vampire; and Igor is just a pathetic character with an even more pathetic voice who quickly becomes the Jar Jar of the game. The game also tries its hand at roleplaying, letting you choose either to "turn" or set loose each of the three or four minions of the villainess, promising that there will be "consequences" to your choice. In practice these consequences are reduced to a different outcome at game's end, which needless to say comes second fiddle to the actual puzzle/HO gameplay for which we're really signing up. The other motivation is supposed to be securing Drac's blood reserve to charge his special powers, but since the use of these powers is always necessary to proceed, the game is forced to give you the required number of (scarcely concealed) bottles of blood, simply plucked from the environment, which renders the only "consequence" the need to take three seconds (that's not hyperbole) to find these in each scene. Finally, the game's formula does get quite old after a time - collect tools and sets of puzzle pieces, complete puzzles, repeat until chapter is complete, repeat until game is complete - but, let's be honest, that's kind of just expected of these games.\n\nDespite all this, the truth is that this game is actually a breath of fresh air. Longer than most, far more innovative than most, and sometimes more creative than most, it's the first of the genre in a long time to make me feel like I was playing an entirely new game. That means something in this market, don't you think?","November 2, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely not worth 10USD.\n\nI'm a bit whiny over the price given the fact that I can buy a game that I can invest over 10x as much hours of gameplay without getting bored and still having things to accomplish for only 2x the price of this game (Ex: Assassin's Creed, Skyrim, etc)\n\n","February 1, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazerniel/recommended/252890/","kazerniel","kazerniel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazerniel/","625 products in account","For those who played Dracula: Origin - this game is quite different, more of the cookie-cutter HO/puzzle/adventure kind, albeit with special abilities and two different endings based on your decisions, which makes it distinctive in this genre. It also has 2D painted art instead of the previous episode's 3D.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Beautiful graphics, especially some HO scenes and the character art\n+ The UI is very modern\n+ Atmospheric  and catchy music\n+ The puzzles of the first half of the game are quite easy\n+ It's nice to see all the items I need to find in a HOS right from the beginning\n+ Interesting to see the locations of the previous game (Dracula: Origin)\n\nCons:\n\n- The character accents sound horribly fake and exaggerated, especially Dracula's and the women's\n- They seem to have reused a lot of the music and sound effects from Sherlock Holmes and the Hound of the Baskervilles\n- The UI is a bit too helpful in Difficult mode, it shouldn't sparkle interactable items at all\n- The late-game puzzles are too difficult, had to skip almost all of them on the first playthrough\n- The item names in the HOS are often imprecise and the game sometimes doesn't accept potential matches because the creators thought of a different but similar item in the scene\n- the same "collect pieces of shields/coats of arms" story progression as in the Sherlock Holmes game, they could have come up with something a bit more original\n- also, many puzzles repeat from the Sherlock Holmes game\n\nSuggestion:\n\n~ I like the option for setting difficulty, but it would be nice to add advanced difficulty options for those who want to customise it. Eg. I like easy puzzles, but also don't like when every interactable items shine and sparkle.","April 9, 2015","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
