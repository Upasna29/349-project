This game was never a serious contender to be anyones favorite game. Most of the people who purchased this probably did so out of curiosity, for the additional features, or maybe just laughs.\n\nFor those curious, the game plays like hotline miami... sorta. There is no language specifiv dialogue (i speak english and spanish) to be found in the story itself, and so maybe if i spoke russian it would make me laugh alot more, but i somehow doubt that. If anyone biligual can let me know if its funny, i'm genuinely interested. Don't buy this out of curiosity, there are too many bugs, and it plays like an unfinished game, because it is one.\n\nIf you plan on buying it for the laughs, i doubt you will get many. The only thing i laughed at was the pictures of the character models. I assume they are cell phone pics of of the game developers  friends or something, and i thought they were legit funny. I got the menus in (broken) english, but i guess the story only displays in russian. I don't fault them for that (i bought a russian game, what did i expect) since it's a russian game, but i really have no clue what the plot is. The art style and effects are not nearly as engaging as HM, and sometimes they can be disorienting and distracting. Oh, and the controls suck.\n\nIf you STILL want to buy it for the level editor, open world gameplay, etc, etc... you are kinda SOL. They are not in the game yet. Considering the game was rushed out in a buggy state (on 4/20... hehe. So edgy. Never been done before) i get the feeling the developers are not people who have a ton of experience with deadlines and PR. That being said, by the time these features are implamented (assuming they actually are) the hype will have faded from the game and you'll have forgotten you ever thought about buying it in the first place.\n\nI bought this when i was drunk to have mindless hotline miami ripoff fun. I am a huge neo-80's nerd, and inebriated me was honestly excited to play a funny looking clone of my favorite game. This ♥♥♥♥ is so bad though, the ♥♥♥♥. I can't even get past the first scene without getting bored.  It's very sluggish, buggy, etc, etc. I have a mid level laptop, and i have never had trouble running The Forest, Rust, CounterStrike and other games, so you can imagine my confusing when the frame rate dropped dring a ♥♥♥♥ing isometric MS paint looking shooter.  There is not any good reason this game should play so poorley. I know i was wasted, and this probably contributed to my lack of fun and understanding. But if you still feel compelled to buy this game, just know that it is not "open world" it has no "level editor" and the game lied to make it seem like it was worth buying. That's pathetic and you should not support developers who push out this half ♥♥♥♥♥ shit.\n\nIf you decide to buy it anyways, good luck navigating through a ♥♥♥♥ing door.","April 21, 2015","false","0.8"," 902 of 984 people (92%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","92","902","984","27","0"

The game feels like a hotline miami game but with it being filled with copyrighted materials (Trollface, Rickroll in a chiptune, and other memes) and having a graphic quality which can rival the adverage MS Paint user.\n\nThe Game Plays well... That is it plays well when your not going though small corridors or walking though doorways which hit on your hitbox which is bigger then your actual body (which makes getting hit behind cover possible). You can get stuck when walking and if you turn direction of you mouse your arm can lodge you into corners and you will need to go back out in the same way you went in.\n\nOn the plus side the music is good, a nice sounding mix of electronic music with some interesting instruments not heard to often in the EDM schene outside of Russian and other Asian Countrys. How ever the chiptune remixes for first time opening the game (will explain more about this a little further down) and the credit scene.\n\nNow on to something i find very concerning towards the way the developers are making doing with the introduction to you when you first turn it on when purchasing the game.\n\nWhen it turns on all of the sudden a catchy tune comes on and your like this sounds familuar. Then the actual tune gets into the groove and you realize.... Its a Rick Roll, this is what ticked me off the first time opening this. This from how i view it was the developers givng the middle finger to anyone who bought the game and said thanks for the money and here have the unfinished game. Let alone it only plays when you first boot up the game which then writes to the file in the games folder named "lol" to disable the start up rick roll.\n\nAbout the unfinished game part. The story is all there(which you can pick and play any episode in any order you want as you don't need to unlock each level) but the "extra" button is shown. Which i decided holds the buttons for the Level editor, Multiplayer, and Free Roam. Saddly i was wrong and was shown all those buttons blanked out with a COMING SOON Banner Plastered over them.... Hopefully this doesn't mean they won't be as this could just be a stunt to say the game will have it but not released yet and will never have it.\n\nSo as of right now i don't recremend the game based on the fact it doesn't have or improve on what existing games already have on Steam let alone this game features copyright violations on the Troll Face Image and Rick Roll song.\n\nI give this in the current state a 4/10","April 20, 2015","false","1.3"," 1,385 of 1,539 people (90%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","90","385","1","27","15"

Whatever it is, all that can be said is that the general reaction of the game's release is negative.\n\nThe gameplay was nice and all, but it had some pretty obvious glitches. I had more difficulty with not getting stuck on the level objects than I did with the enemies themselves, along with the occasional time that doors decide not to work for me.\n\nThe devs have also been pretty interesting. One of the devs right now seems to be on the edge of a minor meltdown on the fourms, with examples being one of the devs telling a poster to "tell wife to make cabbage soup" after some feedback, as well as telling a fan to "go to North Korea if he wants control"] after a thread was made.\n\nIn short, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Sure, it might only be $7.50, but for that money, I would reccomend some other games. Buy it if you really want to, but if you are looking for a game with both good gameplay and a good community, this isn't it.\n\nTL;DR: Don't buy.

So there's no story to be had here.\n\nThe gameplay is something you would expect from a flash game.  And not a very good one!  Avoid!\n\nEdit:  To clarify, my issue is not the fact that the game is written in Russian.  It is that you have to speak Russian fluently in order to even play the damn game.  If you play most other games with this sort of language barrier, it will at least prompt you when you boot the damn thing up which language you want to choose.  More often than not, it's a choice of flags, and English people click on the English flag and so on.  This way, all through the game you have text readable!

Stealth & planning for rampage is non existent in this game unlike Hotline Miami. Collision detection in BK is quite glitched to point where I would teleport out of map.\n\nAlso this game is UNPLAYABLE on a AMD card thanks to horrible optimization.

It's definitely from Eastern Europe, all right. But I know that, gamewise, it's a tremendous ♥♥♥♥ing mess, and it's definitely not as good as the game it is trying to imitate. Is it trying to filter the experience of Hotline Miami through half-empty vodka bottles and angry screeds against Vladimir Putin? It certainly feels that way - the camera physically makes me want to throw up, and the design overall feels like trying to crash a party blasted out of my mind, not quite over the peak of drunkenness that seperates the great buzz from several alcoholic beverages from the regret of having several alcoholic beverages.\n\nBut here's the thing: Hotline Miami works because it is designed so ♥♥♥♥ing tightly that the experience is seamless, anarchic, and bloody, like getting into a fight in the mosh pit at a great concert from a punk band that knows their ♥♥♥♥ and capitulates on their effort and practice. By comparison, Bloodbath Kavkaz is a drunk ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who gets up on stage twenty minutes after the concert's over and tries to pull off that same lick on the lead guitarist's guitar, immediately realizing it's not on the same chord and it doesn't even know what strings to play in what order and fashion. And almost immediately, that drunk ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is taken backstage by the punk band's roadies to be given constructive criticism via a swift beating.\n\nIf you're going to rip something off, rip it off well.

I regret those 6 hours. The game is broken and a chore to play. EDIT: Apparently they added more achievements, but I am not wasting anymore time on this 'game'. This Hotline Miami knockoff is so bad that calling it a knockoff is actually a compliment.\n\n-Gameplay\nThe gameplay is a 2D topdown similar to another game, but it is nothing like the game it takes "inspiration", as the game is so more gun focused that melee weapons are useless, as the player has the ablility to kick which can be used while having a gun. The kick makes melee weapons obselete as it gives the same amount of points. This is merely the tip of the unpolished gameplay, as playing the game feels floaty and weightless when you're moving the character, which leads for the character getting temporarily stuck on objects.  And the bugs, there was many times when the game barely chugged by and crashing. The whole gameplay consists of running and gunning which would be fine if the game was so broken and unpolished.\n\n-Story\nI don't know if I am too stupid to understand this "complex" story which was confusing and had horrible reasons for the whole story. The whole thing was vague and not in a good way. It was confusing as it had no basis for us to connect to. and was utterly bland from my vague understanding of it. The "dank maymays" and Russian "satire" fell flat for me and would probably fall flat for everyone else to.\n\n-Graphics\nLike the gameplay, it just looks so unpolished. The visuals area mess as all the screen effects do not mix well with the Microsoft Paint-like graphics. The whole style is hard to look at and feels generic.\n\n-Soundtrack\nThe whole soundtrack is a mix, some are good but mostly are not a good unique music but rather generic sounding.\n\n-Other\nThe game had originally advertised several features but now is proclaiming them as upcoming features. I doubt that they will actually be released, even if it was, it would be as unpolished and buggy as the rest of the game.\n\nAs the whole game is just one big, unpolished game. It was a waste of money and time. The one minute of whatever "fun" that might be squeezed out of this game is not worth it. 4/10.","May 3, 2015","false","6.6"," 55 of 68 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","55","68","2","0"

No, Bloodbath Kavkaz is a "hilarious" "parody" of Hotline Miami.  Or, put it another way, this is what Hotline Miami would look like if nobody involved with its development were over the age of fifteen, save for one unfortunate musician who was relentlessly badgered into providing the admittedly great soundtrack.\n\nNaturally the game can't ape anything properly from its influence.  Whereas HM based its challenge around planning and tactics, BK instead opts for horrid controls and limited visibility.  Movement is incredibly awkward.  The player character lurches ahead too quickly for any kind of precision and often gets stuck on walls and furniture.  There's also no lock-on feature, so don't even bother fighting while moving.  Meanwhile, your visual range is very narrow, so most kills are made by firing blindly down the hall, and the eye-searing visual effects make it harder still to aim.\n\nFortunately, you do have two advantages: First, the AI is very dumb.  Once alerted, it will just bounce off the walls until it can line up a shot, which is highly exploitable if you're careful.  Second, it's very easy to glitch yourself in and out of the level, so if you don't have to kill anything in a stage you can just bypass the enemies and head straight to the goal.\n\nUltimately my breaking point was a vehicle section in which you must avoid two instant kills, one of which is positioned randomly.  Once I realized just how little control I had over the outcome, I gave it a few more hopeful tries and finally ragequit.\n\nThat's not even getting into the script, which is a cringeworthy mess of bad jokes, nonsensical profanity, and outdated internet memes.  It might amuse those who lied to get around this page's age gate, but adult players will most likely find it incredibly grating.  The only laughs I got out of it were when the abysmal English translation mangled a line beyond comprehension.\n\n♥♥♥♥ this game, ♥♥♥♥ the unfunny hacks who made it, ♥♥♥♥ Steam and IndieGala for allowing it on their services, and most of all, ♥♥♥♥ ME for actually attempting to play it!

The answer is you want to run away as fast as possible. Bloodbath Kavkaz is promoted as a parody of Hotline Miami, but it really is a not funny joke. The game follows on Shamil. Shamil recovers from a car crash and wakes up in a limo and a man by the name Vasily task you to kill a man named Jafar before the dawn or otherwise he will kill Shamil. So how is this game ? This game is one of the worst games I have ever played. The game is a blatant rip off of Hotline Miami and they came under fire and changed a lot of stuff, some of the stuff that was changed was the name from Hotline Kavkaz, the dialogue screens and more minor stuff. This game is also incredibly difficult due to the incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls. I finished the game in around two hours so it's also incredibly short. The game says it has different endings but all of them are the same endings even though clearly you have different choices. The only good thing about this game is that some of the songs from the soundtrack are pretty good, but a lot are bad. The game has bad level design, bad controls, garbage story and awful graphics. Who would buy this over Hotline Miami is beyond me. This is not worth your time and hard earned money. I give Bloodbath Kavkaz a 2/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","May 20, 2015","false","3.2"," 63 of 88 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","63","88","2","4"

The worst thing about this game is how buggy it is - your characters sticks to walls and objects in the way and gets stuck, which leaves you open to getting killed. Also, I had a big issue with the FOV because some enemies won't even appear on screen until they are too close to you. Holding Shift helps a little, but even if I move the mouse up or down, it seems pretty random when the camera also decides to pan in the direction you're pointing too - very inconsistent. The gameplay itself is fine and very much like Hotline Miami - I feel like this is how Hotline Miami played after it's first build. This game needs more polishing before I would recommend it to anyone, especially since it isn't bad overall (it just feels unfinished).'","March 13","false","2.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Simply because someone made a game that wasnt geared towards english speaking players, doesnt make it a bad game. Its a good game, period. It wasnt made by a team of 100+ programmers, its not a polished masterpiece. Their are going to be issues. Biggest complaints Ive read so far are russian menus [fixable], russian story text [fixable], and sluggish graphics [fixable]. Read below for instructions on how to fix these issues and please give the game another chance if you gave up on it....its worth it.\n\nStep 1: Access settings menu\nClick the menu item one up from the bottom.\n\nStep 2: Change menu and game language\nClick the text (Русский) in the right hand collumn to change the menu text (reference picture linked above). This will change the menu language from russian to english. NOTE: Two items down from menu language you will see an item that still says Русский. Click this as well to change the story language. If you dont, you wont know whats going on in the story.\n\nStep 3: Graphics settings\nI dont know why but in full screen mode the game runs at about half speed. Its almost unplayable like this so find the full screen setting and change it to false. Once it goes windowed you can click the maximize button on the winow itself so it takes up the whole screen.\n\nlanguage settings save once the game is closed, but the full screen setting must be changed to windowed each time you open the game.\n\nBottom line\n-Its a weird indie style game, if your not into the sort of thing then dont buy it.\n-English is not the devs primary language, so language settings need to be changed and some story dialogue translations seem a little off.\n-There are bugs, all games have them. Level starting locations seem weird, I fell off and under the floor once and had to restart to get back in the level, also guns can be picked up through walls. Glitches like that are typical here but not usually game breaking.\n-Its up to you, all I'm saying is the biggest complaints in 90% of the negative reviews are easily fixable. I was entertained and happy with the purchase.\n\nThis game sucks =/","October 25, 2015","true","1.5"," 11 of 45 people (24%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","24","11","45","4","2"

While the graphics are extremely low-rent, once I turned off all the after effects (which is necassary to get the game running above 20FPS) I found myself liking them. The same way that pixel graphics are nostalgic for a slightly older audience, the MS Paint graphics reminiscent of games found on Newgrounds or Flash Player in the early 2000s really strike a chord with me. The story is fairly interesting, and I would even rank it above Hotline Miami 2 for having actual focus, rather than just portraying a series or vaguely related events. Gameplay is the obvious weak point, with a large amount of bugs and geometry problems. AI that starts shooting the second you get within 10ft. of enemies, regardless of where they are facing/if there is a wall, makes melee combat nigh-impossible. Even with this glaring flaw, I've had a lot of fun with this game, and am looking forward to the extra modes. If you like Hotline Miami and/or weird Russian stuff, wait for the price to drop a few bucks and give it a try.","May 12, 2015","true","1.7"," 39 of 163 people (24%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","24","39","163","11","0"

Of course it's heavily inspired by Hotline Miami, maybe it's even a rip-off if you want to call it that, but it's still bringing original stuff to the table.\nAnother reason people seem to hate this game for are the "memes", but if you get deeper into the game and it's story you will see what the developers actually think of memes and internet culture.\nOne last thing that people critizise while comparing this game to HM is that it apparently doesn't have a story that's as deep and meaningful as HM's story, but once again I have to say that once you actually play the game you will find meaning behind the story, even if it's not as complex as HM's story.\nThe game itself is actually really self aware about it's content and it's not taking itself too seriously, which is what I enjoy about it.\n\nAll in all I'm recommending this game because I like it for what it is, even though there's a couple of bugs here and there that take away from the experience.","April 21, 2015","true","11.8"," 37 of 698 people (5%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","5","37","698","26","19"

But the worst problem is the aiming, the aiming is attrocious, seriously i could have played this game if the aiming was the ONLY thing you got right from Hotline Miami, but you didn't, you messed it up so bad that your aiming icon is static while you move, WHO THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA, IT'S TERRIBLE! Do not but this game, it really isnt ever worth the $1.49 I paid for it.","March 31","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
