It's not difficult to guess that our way consists of shooting at enemies and avoiding their bullets and we do it to earn money for upgrading our ship. The final goal is to defeat the boss, which will be available after collecting 100% of dark matter. There are fortuitous events and procedurally generated sets of opponents as well as random loot (several types of guns). The game has nice graphic design, convenient system of control and last but not least really great soundtrack.","May 29","true","2.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

Not so here, the game has a simple premise, pixel art style and nice soundtrack.\n\nIt took me around 3 hours to complete the game on Twitch including many deaths. I started out feeling like the mouse controls were way to sensitive, after getting to level 15 and seeing how fast the shots from the other ships are I was very happy that you could move your ship so fast. :)\n\nThe setup works well, play through increasingly difficult levels collecting upgrades, money and dark matter. The game allows you to repeat levels for times you may get stuck and in need of upgrades. I repeated a couple of levels myself in order to be able to upgrade my energy to use a shiny new weapon.\n\nI cant really fault it for the price. It scratched an itch I had and likely will do again.","April 8","true","2.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

Note that my ability to enjoy a game is not influenced by how I recieved it. If you would like to see the TL;DR, go to the summary at the bottom of the review.\nAmaranthine is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up consisting of you, a spaceship commander, blasting the metal brains out of enemy space vessels.\n\nThe premise is something along the lines of a distant frozen planet that has sent out a distress signal, and you having to investigate. There is a fairly brief explanation of this at the start which plays each time you start a new game. (I'll just add here as a tip: to skip the cutscene and get straight to the action, simply press the escape button.) This brief explanation is perfect because it makes the story simple and unobtrusive, whilst at the same time giving the game a purpose.\n\nOnce you are ready to obliterate some enemy ships you will be plunged straight into the action. Each level is randomly generated to add more replayability to the the gameplay. This gameplay is a great lot of fun, consisting of you traveling through an endless amount of (surprisingly difficult) levels with a variety of enemies, weapons and environmental hazards. For many shmups, this would be the end of the list of gameplay features. However, Amaranthine has an interesting weapon upgrade/loot system. During each level you can collect alloys from the destroyed ships which you then use to upgrade your ship in between levels. You are also given the chance to collect weapons from other destroyed ships which you can then use to place one of the three weapon spots your ship has. I've seen some people complaining about the sensitivity of the mouse, however this sensitivity is required (especially in later levels) to perform precise manoeuvres.\n\nThe pixelated graphics suit the style of game and are pleasing to look at as well as the backgrounds, though they do start to get a bit monotonous. I would suggest that some different styled backgrounds be introduced.\n\nRegarding music and sounds, one word: majestic. These sounds, both soothing and heart-pumping are the reason this game is tagged with Great Soundtrack. Take a listen here[soundcloud.com].\n\nThe game is a great deal for the low price of $2.99. The cost is definitely not overpriced and respects the content of the game. This would be something that I couldn't excuse not buying in a sale.\n\nAny other points regarding the game would be the lack of options. An ability to change the mouse sensitivity may stop the complaints coming through.\n\nSummary:\nPros:\n✔ An unobtrusive story\n✔ Fun gameplay\n✔ Great upgrade system\n✔ Nice visuals\n✔ Majestic music\n✔ Low price\n\nCons:\n✘ Backgrounds can get monotonous\n✘ Lack of options\n\nConclusion:\nAmaranthine is a great, simple game and definitely one of the better SHMUPs you can get your hands on. For its low price, I'd heavily recommend picking it up especially if you are a fan of the genre.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nDid you enjoy that review?

Probably not but it is still a decent one with some intersting game features like the weapon selection after each level.  Could it be better? Yes, the developper(s?) could have added shield improvement feature or maybe a secondary powerful weapon to use with the mouse right click (the game seems to play only with the mouse).\n\nIt is a good game if you have 5 - 15 min to kill and free your brain.","April 7","true","0.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It's a throw back to some of my favorite console games (think R-Type or Thunder Force). The sound track is great, and the ability to find new weapons and improve your ship is awesome. The levels are always different as well in terms of the lay out of enemies so you aren't always subjected to the same static layouts that you may be used to seeing with these games. the controls for this game are also very simple and easy to get used to. The only thing that is slightly lame about this game is maybe the backgrounds you see while playing, since they are mostly very similar and kind of boring, but that would be a shallow reason for not at least giving this game a try. This game is a steal of a deal - you won't regret it!","April 9","true","2.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Игра имеет довольно динамичный геймплей и в то же время довольно приемлемый уровень сложности. На удивление много разннобразных противников. Чтобы пройти основную часть придется немного попотеть, благо благодаря возможности кастомизации между уровнями можно подобрать подходящий для своего стиля игры набор оружия, которое, при правильной комбинации значительно упрощает игру. Очень приятно удивила музыка, не ожидал что в игре подобного уровня будет столь качественный саундтрек. Должен сказать что поначалу мне не понравилось управление (ну не привык я мышкой играть в такое), но потом, приноровившись и осознав что большую часть тех кульбитов которые требуются от игрока на геймпаде не сделать, я изменил своё мнение. Однако, невзирая на это считаю что поддержа пада быть должна. Немного огрчает отсутствие полноэкранного режима ибо играть в окне не особо комфортно.\nВ целом это хорошая игра для любителей жанра. Однозначно маст ♥♥♥♥♥♥.","April 7","true","6.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","2"
