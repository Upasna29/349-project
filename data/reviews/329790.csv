Each figure or set that you can buy comes with a code to redeem on the digial version so you can play online with other people. If the rules seem complicated and hard to follow or it seems like this game is too P2W, it's because this was a collectible miniatures game first and a video game second.\n\nIf you're coming into this game now, you're about 3 years late, and that means you've missed 3 'seasons' of characters, add ons, new rules, countless tournaments, meta-strategy development and erata. If it seems like everyone else knows what they are doing better than you do, it's because they probably do, because they've been playing this since it was originally a browser-only application.\n\nAll of that said, I think this game is amazing if you're a fan of Ankama's Wakfu and Dofus universes, if you like RPGs, if you like strategic games, and if you like collectible games where you can try all kinds of silly combinations and tactics, mixing and matching your team of units, then you can probably get into this game and have a lot of fun without spending a cent.\n\nLike many other popular free to play games, you can dump in cash and get some of the most powerful characters, but the rules of the game and the random elements mean that having Goultard or Nox or Qilby is not a guaranteed win. In many cases, those characters can be a liability because they are huge targets and they drastically restrict your team composition by taking up most of your points. It all comes down to a careful balance of skill and luck,\n\nIf you don't want to spend money, there's a weekly free rotation of characters for you to use without restriction. If you play enough, win enough, do the single player challenges, and sometimes just hang out long enough, you can earn additional figures without spending a cent.  And with the physical game still releasing new sets and new characters, there will are plenty of future updates planned, meaning more maps, more single-player challenges, and if the Krosmaster Quest Add-on is any indication, we may even see a full-blown co-operative campaign mode some day.","November 15, 2015","true","18.7"," 57 of 66 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","57","66","2","1"

I found myself playing this game quite a bit but always left every game session with a frustrating taste in my mouth. Every team I faced in the PVP mode was always more powerful than my own, it seems as if the games community is made mostly of seasoned players and even at the lower ranks a brand new player stands little chance without knowing the game fully. Beyond that there is no way to communicate with any of these seasoned players for helpful advice what so ever within the game. There is no chat what so ever beyond using pre-existing replies in a match. That left A disconnect between me and a possible commuity that could have greatly helped my newbe self progress through the game.\n\nNow collecting the verious characters throughout was an interesting and almost addicting task as I was my opponents using a number of what seem to be. "Must Have," Characters I myself went out to collect said characters to improve my teams. What I found was a slow grind through PVE mode collecting funds to roll for a random chance character as well as trying to complete any single players achievements as well. PVP as I stated was rather difficult due to advanced teams with characters I myself was not so lucky to face. If a player does not win a match they do not gain any credit what so ever to help purchase or at least random roll new characters. This did not help at all as one would assume.\n\nIf you enjoy tactical games and do not mind on putting down cash for a pack of characters this might just be the game for you. But if you are a free player you might have to be a lucky one to random roll strong enough characters to push your team forward.\n\n","November 14, 2015","false","27.0"," 59 of 87 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","59","87","0","3"

You were able to get figures from the games Dofus and Wakfu and this was great! However, now with this huge revamp, you're unable to get new figures via Dofus and Wakfu. Instead you can do ranked games, Adventure mode and Achievements to get currency to buy a RANDOM figure box. This will give you a random figure from one of the Seasons 1,2,3 or all of them. This is pay to win because, you can spend a lot of money on this and get really powerful figures that can overpower a lot of teams. However, one of the best things about this game is the fact that there is a currency in the game part. There is coins you can get which will buy you equipment or one time use spells. These can be a game changer which can help against p2w people. So don't get your hopes down because you don't think you can win! Start off by doing Adventure mode this will give you currency to buy the figures!\nAlso please comment if you have any questions and I'll do my best to answer them!\nHere is a video of me playing the Adventure mode. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZV9zsE78fI","November 9, 2015","true","6.5"," 57 of 84 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","57","84","0","20"

The rules of the board game are like 20 pages long and they try to fit all of that into a 30-60 minute Tutorial which is not that easy, since you are playing and not reading the manual all the time. If you really want to understand the deep mechanics of the game completely you have to read the rules to the boardgame at some point, because some things aren`t even explained in the Tutorial. You could also watch this video after playing it a little bit then you should understand it completely:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmWMPEq_Sww\n\nWhen you want to get better at this game, you can check out my Youtube channel, where I am uploading Gameplay and Tips & Tricks videos.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/Rikerslash\nIf you have question about this game fell free to add me to your friend list I am happy to help.\n\nIf you are looking for a highly competitive 2-player game (single player is also implemented) with amazing looking figurines and deeply strategic elements, then definitly check out this game.","November 10, 2015","true","76.7"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","0"

That's a pretty good game when you want to analyze the meta and counter it, I probably spend 60% of my time in build when I'm playing.

There is a tutorial that does an okay job to explain how the game works, but nowhere in game the mechanics are explained. You cannot revise a rule or mechanic at all and you have to rely on other sources to do just that (For in deep mechanisms, there is http://static.ankama.com/downloads/krosmaster/krosmaster_arena_boardgame_rules.pdf which does a much better job)\n\nSecond problem is the single adventure mode. It is, okay, but extremely bland and repetitive. One big issue is how you cannot use your own figurines and are forced to use a preset for each world.\n\nMultiplayer is problematic too. The matchmaking seems completely out of whack and usually two outcomes of a match is possible for you : You lose because the opponent had a very good powerful team, or you win because the opponent just decided to drop off the match. There's also no way to chat with others beside the pre made chat, "oppressing" new players and not letting more advanced players be more friendly and welcoming to new players.\n\nHowever, biggest problem yet is to get new Krosmaster : It is borderline pay to win. The price is horrendously high, you're not sure what you will be getting either. I wouldn't have any problems spending some cash, if the pricing wasn't that stupidly high. Sorry, but 2$ for a random figuring is by far way too much. You can get some Kros and fragments by playing the single player mode and winning against other people, but it's by far waaaay too slow. What Ankama could do is give us a daily challenge on the single mode and if you win, you get 50 Kros.\n\nFor now, the best people can do to obtain new Krosmasters is to either have an Ankama account and buy Ogrines from their website so the cost is about 20% lower than with Steam, or play Dofus with a high level character and know ways to make a ton of Kamas, then exchange them for Ogrines, then buy Krosmasters, but even here it's very, very time consuming.\n\nIf you can get past these numerous downsides, then the game is actually kind of fun, unless you have to face a player that has a viable team from the Krosmaster "metagame" which is never fun at all, but it is doable if you don't rush and get lucky","December 4, 2015","true","44.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really like the boardgame, but this review will focus mainly on the transfer from board- to videogame.\n\nIt is a nice way to play the game when nobody is around, or your friends that also play the game, live in a different area.\nThe animationquality is decent, just don't expect anything to spectacular(then again, something to flashy might actually disrupt the strategyaspects of the game).\nYou get a free rotation of krosmasters which is helpful if you see a krosmaster you might want to give a shot(I use it to test teamcomps with promotional krosmasters I don't own)\n\nI never had server-issues, but some people that live outside of europe reported problems, but since it is f2p you can just go and see for yourself.\n\nThe game does most of the dice roling and stuff like that in the background, and since you don't have to set up the board every time you want to play, it is way faster to play than the actual boardgame is.\n\nLast of the actual gaming aspects is the adventuremode, a singleplayermode they added for the online client. It plays a little like a puzzlegame, where you have to find solutions to problems with given tools. I prefer the actual game but you can earn some Krosz(the stuff you need to buy digital figurines) there.\n\nThe one thing I wouldn't recommend doing, is buying the krosmasters in their digital form, since that seems rather expensive to me. I suggest buying the real figurines, since all of those come with an actual code for you to enter, so you can use them in the digital version of the game. That way, the Krosmasters are more expensive, but you can play IRL as well, which in my opinion, is always more fun with boardgames.","November 10, 2015","true","85.1"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

Krosmaster Arena is a simple to play tactical 'board' game with enough depth to be engaging. I'm bothered a bit by the finite amout of in-game currency you earn but there's enough content and ways to earn it'll keep you going for quite a while, and hopefully seasons and such can turn finite into infinite.\n\nMy early impressions video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rPTAxG2GE","November 13, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Their signature artstyle looks just as distinct and as amazing in this new format as it has in both Wakfu AND Dofus, and seems to have a cel shade aspect to it. This seems to essentially be pure Wakfu turn-based strategy goodness, but with multiple player controlled features, existinct characters from the Krozmoz universe instead of classes, and more interesting mechanics like "locking" an enemy in place, certain tiles on the board being stores, and much more.\n\nDEFINITELY worth checking out if you were ever a fan of any Ankama property.","November 22, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's a matchmaking a la HearthStone, but i've picked noob and more experienced players, on the starting rank, so maybe a tweak on that matter will make the game more enjoyable for new players.\n\nIt's not a really simple board game, with coins and shops and etc, so it can be a little confusing.\n\nA people should stop comparing this to Wakfu and Dofus, it isn't a sequel, it's the digitalization of the Real World board game, which in it's place, it's a covnersion of Wakfu's Battle System to the Board Game World.\n\n","November 23, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I know that sounds convoluted and meta but Krosmaster is a pretty well rounded strategy game. I have enjoyed it what I've played of it.  At its core Krosmaster Arena is about fighting the minifigures in turn based battles moving and using abilities, etc. The free to play digital game as well over 100 playable figures from what I have read.\n\nNow I myself am not extremely fimiliar with the intricacies of Krosmaster Arena but I am fairly sure there is also a physical figure/toy tabletop component to it, with collectible figures and what not. This all sounds fine and dandy, especially if you are already a fan of Krosmaster from playing one of the other games in universe (Dofus and Wakfu).\n\nIf anyone is still interested after reading about it they should definitely try it, while its not for everybody it can hook some people in real tight. Krosmaster Arena is free on Steam now and you dont have anything to lose trying it besides a little bit of time.","November 11, 2015","true","1.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/x2Madda/recommended/329790/","x2Madda","x2Madda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/x2Madda/","264 products in account","Its not a DOTA game, its a Tile-based tactics game but I don't know what to make of it.\n\nNothing about the game offends me, not even the Street Fighter 2-esque racism.\nYou know the kind, this guy is a native so give him a giant bone through his nose and a Tiki tribal mask.\nBut seriously, the world has moved on so much that its not even offensive, its like picking up your dads old black and white copy of a naughty magazine or VHS tape, you are looking at a relic of history so its pointless to be upset.\n\nI only bring it up because there isn't much else to say about the game.\n\nThe game makes a stern effort to give you lots of busy work but yet somehow fails.\nIn the vein of Banner Saga Tactics and dare I say, Final Fantasy Tactics, the game is played on a grid. You move your units based on initative then when all of your team moves, the enemy moves their whole team-- Hmm?\nInitative? That is the order that you move your uni-- No, the enemy doesn't move until all your units have moved. Planning? Well you can plan around the completely hindering system they devised.\n\nIf the enemy can't do anything until I hit 'end turn' why even force me to move units in a set, specific order? Maybe I want to set up traps or maybe character #4 packs a big punch and I need to gauge if it will be enough to kill or I don't know, maybe I want to be trusted to be able to move my own team in any damn order I want!\n\nA small issue. Minor. Not worth getting annoyed about really. Except the game is littered with weird oddities like this and  OF COURSE, the game eithers tells you something once and only once or it flat out doesn't tell you at all what the less important things are or do such as armor, what does it do? No idea. Dubs? Check 'em? Why can I win if I get enough doubles? No, I haven't started catering to the lowest common denominator, the game is covered in memes and "references" which brings me to another gripe. Who is this game marketed at?\n\nI have nothing against ♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥ or even 99chan but that audience is usually crass, foul mouthed and likely to offend someone at worst and everyone at best, like an episode of South Park but not as well written. Now imagine trying to make a South Park or ♥♥♥♥♥...For kids. Don't confuse allowing kids to watch or visit ♥♥♥♥♥ as being the same thing. I am talking about taking out all the nudity, racism and foul language while still trying to be offensive.\nYou are no longer 99chan; you are Reddit and even Reddit has a 18+ front page for offensive content.\n\nYou won't be offended while playing Krosmaster Arena but like a 4kids dub of One Piece you are very aware of how much censoring has occoured. Not a unique problem with this one game either as it is part of the Wakfu/Dofus family which all share the same issue right down to the TV show.\n\nBut back to the game; If you are a fan of Dofus then this is like the PvP mode turned into a standalone only now you control a whole party instead. For everyone else its an obtuse tactics game that is quite shallow but can be fun in short bursts.\n\nAnakama have an unfortunate history of screwing you over with overpriced DLC and microtranactions so even if you do enjoy spending money in games, your money is best spent elsewhere because Anakama will happily bleed you dry in that department.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","November 10, 2015","false","4.3"," 20 of 114 people (18%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","18","20","114","10","7"
