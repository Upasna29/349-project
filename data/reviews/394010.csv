I can't even explain how bad this is, first off, the controls are wicked messed up, sometimes when I'm supposedly moving forward, my character will glitch and go backwards instead.\n\nAnd the very beginning of the game doesn't even try to help you understand what or where you're supposed to even look at, once you figured that out, have fun cooking some burgers while waiting 30 seconds each... So much fun, not to mention that I had the hardest time trying to figure out how to even cook burgers or fries or make a drink, there was no labels ANYWHERE, it was all guess work.\n\nEven after you get out of the restaurant that you work for, there is absolutely no help to aim you to where your house is located, you just have to randomly walk around and hope you don't randomly get attacked by a dog wandering about. I mean, why put random attacking dogs out of no where, I don't think anyone is going to be prepared for that ESPECIALLY with the awkward movement controls. NOT TO MENTION THAT FINDING MY HOUSE WAS A PAIN BECAUSE THERE WAS NO INDICATION TO WHICH DIRECTION IT WAS AT... like freaking seriously it isn't hard to put a marker on the screen.\n\nI finally got there after dying once, and then this weird ♥♥♥ thing happens where I think I get framed for the murder of my friend? I walked into my house and he's dead then all the sudden I see a swarm of cops out of no where around my house, they do take their sweet ♥♥♥ time getting in though, because they are badly programmed, they kept trying to walk through the walls so I had to walk towards them to end that stupid scene, and then I was in jail.\n\nNot too long after that I just gave up on the game. I mean for goodness sake you don't even know what you're supposed to do once you're in the jail cell, you could literally just sit in there forever without looking at the top left to see that you have a freaking note you have to read.\n\nFrom what this game sounded like, I was expecting some pretty neat open world crime game where you break into people's houses of your choosing and do other ♥♥♥♥. But all I got was some linear, boring game play. I mean, this does not seem like the type of game where rats or dogs should just randomly attack you out of no where, totally ruins the immersion.\n\nI would give this game more of a chance but I don't want to risk wasting 9 dollars, so I'm refunding, maybe one of you guys will like this but it isn't worth my 9 dollars.","April 10","false","0.4"," 53 of 58 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","53","58","7","9"
