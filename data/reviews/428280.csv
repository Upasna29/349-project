A little frustrating every time you try to get into the 'toolbox' on the lower edge it toggles between going back a room and your items. Other than that irritation with the interface the game was quite fun to play. Only got truly stumped on the game where you order numbers.","December 20, 2015","true","5.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaotia/recommended/428280/","kaotia","Kaotia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaotia/","310 products in account","One of the best Hidden Object games on Steam. Good graphics and cutscenes, challenging puzzles, detailed map so no backtracking is needed, 4 difficulty settings, in-game achievements and other extras. The choices taken throughout the story will determine the ending and this gives this game a lot of replay value...and it's also a nice change from other titles. The HO scenes are very interesting with lots of little details moving in the background, it makes everything less stagnant.","March 24","true","3.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It's pretty, the puzzles are decent if derivative, and the voice acting isn't bad... but it's incoherent. A modern detective is searching for a little girl who has been kidnapped to a fairy tale, magical kingdom that apparently sits squat in the middle of modern-day Earth? Ghosts inhabit medieval smithies littered with modern hardware and safety equipment? The magical-meets-modern thing has been done successfully in these games, but there isn't even an attempt at an explanation here. It's just a checklist of themes and puzzles, weirdly mishmashed together.\n\nWorse are the achievements. Some border on unreasonable (five items in five seconds) and others exist solely to pad play-time. To wit, there are a number of utterly meaningless decision points throughout the game: you choose to play nice, and go on your way (and eventually earn an achievement for being nice)... or you act like a jerk to ghosts or solve an environmental puzzle violently... and earn precisely the same result, plus a 'you're a jerk' trophy if you go straight through like that. You still have to do the ghosts' quests and solve the same puzzles. It's completely meaningless.","May 21","false","5.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
