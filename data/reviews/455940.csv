The first thing I did was start the campaign. A good thing because it started learning this game. The problem is it takes a long time to explain what everything means. NUM: n to n, SUM: n to n, sum %2. Even after playing through it all, and eventually finding out what it means. A few moments later, oh yeah, what does this mean again. No tips if you hover above the text. Try to find the right puzzle to find the description again.\n\nThis doesn't mean I don't enjoy this game. I like the concept and the puzzles. Logical thinking and math. I say yes to that. You can get into the game. It's an easy concept but addictive. It's a gem but unpolished. And therefore I do not recommend it (yet)\n\nThe came should be polished, and a lot.\ncons:\nTimer doesn't stop when finished.\nDescriptions and interface confusing. Need more tooltips.\nHints show immediately. It ruins the fun in a logic game.\nWhen finished a puzzle in campaign, no continue in screen, but on top of the screen there is a button, which you always can use\nNo good tutorial.\n\nPro:\nNice concept.\nGetting more challenging over time, because rules change","April 12","false","1.2"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","0"

I do think it is more about logic and seeing patterns than it is about math. The little math you need to do is adding up numbers up till a sum of 16 :) Every level took me no more than 3 minutes.\n\nTutorial and tips are very helpfull and eleborate. I only don't get what the pink dotted line means, wasn't explained or I looked past it.. Didn't matter for completing the levels though.\n\nAfter I finished the campaign, I tried to generate some playing fields of 3x4 and bigger but it keeps telling me it is impossible with whatever option I try. So I don't think there is any replayability to this game unfortunately :(\n\nIn the end I do think this game is definitely worth the €0,99.","May 19","true","2.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game is about solving puzzles with numbers, by adding up 4 numbers to make the awnser in the middle of the 4 numbers. The puzzles get more diffuclt and bigger the further you come in the game, but when you first start the game it is a bit confusing because there is no tutorial or nothing that tells you what to do. After you kinda find out how it works it can be really fun!","May 13","true","3.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
