They are both welcome additions to the game, alongside reworked puzzles, new secrets, and the previously released DLC. There's not a lot of extra things to see or do, but for a returning player who wants a bit more of the Q.U.B.E. universe, $5 isn't a big hole in the pocket.\n\nHowever, the reason I prefer the original over this version is based on two things; the first being the actual lack of story in the original. There was almost a haunting mysteriousness to it, in the sense that you never truly understand the game as a whole. You pick up bits and pieces of things, formulating and speculating the who and what and where and when, but in the end, there were no concrete answers. These are the elements that made the game enjoyable for me beyond the gameplay. It was the time I spent wondering, "what really is behind all of this?"\n\nThe second reason being the soundtrack. The original game has a much more upbeat, ambient electronic score. It's catchy, it's fun to listen to, and I found myself listening to it even outside of the game. While the new soundtrack isn't necessarily bad, as it has been tweaked to fit the new found atmosphere that coincides with the added narrative, it simply just isn't as memorable. There were a few tracks that I did enjoy, but in the end it cannot compare to what was.\n\nIf you haven't played Q.U.B.E. do yourself a favor and track down a copy of the original. It's a short, simple, but entertaining and involving. If you're a returning fan who doesn't mind throwing a fiver down to replay and re-experience the game in a different light, go for it. It's not the best five bucks you'll ever spend, but I personally don't have any regrets. It gave me an excuse to have some fun with it again, and most importantly enjoy myself.

Part of what made the original so great was the lack of any background. It was a blank slate and very mysterious, and so you put your own imagination and own story into the gameplay. I loved it. The Director's Cut forces you into a, quite frankly, stupid story that is nothing compared to what your imagination would give the game were you playing the original.\n\nThe voiceover is more annoying and distracting than anything. It's like having an audio book playing in the background while you play the game: completely unrelated to what you're doing and ruining your concentration.","October 31, 2014","false","0.5"," 80 of 106 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","80","106","0","1"

Director's Cut back-to-back in a weekend. I have posted this review for both versions of the game so you can decide which you'd prefer to play. They are essentially the same game, but the Director's Cut adds two characters that talk to you, the silent protagonist, throughout the game. These characters serve to tell the story of what the hell is (or isn't?) going on, which, while not particularly deep or even explained at all in the original version, is interesting because it had me waffling back and forth between what I thought the ending would be... or if there would actually be two endings. Spoiler: There's only one ending, but the game really should have had two, depending on a final choice you had to make. A huge missed opportunity, IMO. At first the narrative seemed cliché, but considering how many times I changed my mind as to what the conclusion to the game's story would actually be... that was unique. I was satisfied.\n\nI understand why many judge this game superficially as Portal-esque, and aesthetically, it is quite similar. And it's a first-person puzzler. And there are very few characters. And it's not a very long game. And there's no combat. The voice acting in the Director's Cut was well done (although sparse), and the music was pleasing as well. Controls, movement, etc., were nothing to rave about, but not really worth complaining about either, considering the type of game. I just wish buttons activated and deactivated much faster. Making a mistake because of the delay just irked me.\n\nThe puzzle content from the original and the Director's Cut is essentially the same, but I noticed in the Director's Cut they removed at least one puzzle that players of the original despised (myself included; I wanted to kill the planet after fumbling with it for half an hour and then looking up the solution, taking solace in the fact that I was not the only befuddled player). Took me roughly 4 hours to beat the original (which includes banging my head over two puzzles in particular), and then, once knowing all the solutions to the puzzles, it only took me 2.5 hours to breeze through the Director's Cut. I feel like the original game had more difficult (in a bad way) puzzles which were removed from the Director's Cut, but I did stumble upon two hidden puzzles in the Director's Cut that I didn't encounter in the original. I'm sure there are other nuggets hiding somewhere I missed.\n\nTo put all my thoughts into a tidy, six-sided package: If you're a fan of Portal, A Story About My Uncle, or Quantum Conundrum, check this title out. Short, sweet, and satisfying. The original feels a bit longer and more difficult, but the Director's Cut felt less frustrating and more interesting.","September 20, 2015","true","2.6"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","33","34","0","1"

A woman's voice sounds over a radio.  "Fingers crossed you can hear me. You are in a large ship in space headed for Earth. You are humanity's last hope for survival.  Solve some puzzles, destroy the cube."\n\nAs the story progresses another voice crackles across the radio in your suit.  "The woman is lying. Her fingers are crossed behind her back. They stole your memories and trapped you in an underground test facility.  Do you really think solving tests will somehow save the world?"\n\nThe puzzles are fairly simple in design, though solving them can and does become very complex by the end of the game.  You're limited to 5 abilities: red cubes expand and contract, blue cubes bounce objects into the air, yellow cubes transform into stairs, green cubes create blocks that can activate switches, and purple cubes rotate sections of the room.\n\nThe game is fairly short, which is good since the mechanics don't really allow for much variation in puzzle design.  The solutions become more convoluted as the game progresses, but ultimately you're doing the same thing over and over again on a grander scale each time.\n\nAside from the new story, the director's cut also includes 3 beta puzzles that were note included in the original game.  These puzzles are essentially 3D tilt labyrinths and they add a tiny bit of variety to the game.  There are also some speed run levels to see how quickly you can click your mouse on colored blocks as you run forward through a level, but I don't much enjoy those types of challenges.","December 31, 2015","true","3.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","1"

I will however still recommend purchasing either this, or the original (whichever is cheaper) and playing it because it is a good puzzle game.\n\nThe following applies to both games, original and directors cut.\n\nNeat puzzle game, decently challenging. Stark black/white visuals with occasional splashes of color to seperate the puzzle elements.\n\nNow, if you have never played this game before, I'd recommend buying the original (especially if it is cheaper). The reason being, the original is a good PUZZLE game with an interesting backdrop. The directors cut feels the need to tell a story, that frankly, has been told a thousand times.\n\nTechincally this version has more content, but honestly I felt the original had a better feel to it simply because it gave you no pretext. It didn't give you a subtext to what was happening, this shoehorns one in for frankly no reason.\n\nSo in short, if you can ignore the blatant voiceovers and both are the same price, buy this since it has more content. If the original is cheaper, buy that.\n\n\n\nSPOILERS BELOW (not that it matters honestly):\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriously? A kid broke into your house because there was a fire? Why not call the fire department? Why not yell "Hey there's a fire! The second he broke in? How the hell did you manage to get downstairs without seeing/hearing/smelling a fire?\n\nSeriously?\n\nAlso the ending of this game is incredibly concrete (as in there is no room for interpritation) yet it leaves a LOT out in the open.\n\nWhat happened to the player character? Did he live? Did he die? Was this all a dream? Was the end sequence just something he created in his mind, or did all of that actually happen?\n\nIf the end was completely literal, why did solving cube puzzles destroy the "ship"? Why was there not a single inhabitant on the ship? Who built it? Did it just build itself and set a collision course with the earth? Why would it do this? It's clearly been made by something, the entire thing is made up of cubes (sans the television screens and shuttle in the last scene). Which brings up another point, why were there television screens and shuttles in something only made of cubs?\n\nThe only credit I will give the story in the Director's Cut was that they turned the whole "crazy man tells you the truth about a goverment consipiracy" cliche on it's head by revealing it was just a stranded man who wanted company. I guess that's something.\n\nEither way this was wholly unnessicary and a large waste of resources for the developer. They should have just put all this time and effort into developing another title instead of writing a mediocre story for the existing game that was actually pretty atmospheric with no dialogue.\n\nSo again, buy whichever is cheaper, but honestly I'd recommend the original over this any day.","November 13, 2014","true","2.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

With those things said, Q.U.B.E. is still a fantastic puzzle experience, and other than some frustrating moments in harder puzzles towards the end where you have to repeat gameplay too often, it does a great job at gameplay, and stands alone.\n\nHighlights\nI think the reason Q.U.B.E. works is that it knew it probably couldn't beat Portal in terms of story, design and gameplay, and instead focused on just making the puzzles and experience simple and focused, but fun.\n\n* Great use of lighting and colour which keep a minimalist feel, similar to that of Mirrors Edge, but allows for some more interesting art style when needed\n* The nice ambient soundtrack and lack of rush or impending action keep things mellow and smooth and match the visuals\n* Tutorial elements and introductions to the mechanics feel natural and are well implemented\n\nMistakes\n* It's a short game, but still feels slightly repetitive towards the end due to the lack of variety in mechanics. Breaking up the puzzles with more platforming, or more interesting segments would've went a long way\n* The narrative added in the Directors Cut is a pointless addition and takes away the atmosphere and isolation\n\nRecommendationsAvailable on Steam for £6.99/9.99€/$9.99 at the time of review and clocking in at around 4 hours of gameplay, it's a fair deal when on sale.\n\nThere were originally two versions of Q.U.B.E. available, the original and the Director's Cut which added Oculus Rift support, a couple new puzzles and the 10-level time trial mode DLC. Unfortunately it also added a poor narrative, which adds very little and takes away from the games mysterious, isolated nature. Copies of the original Q.U.B.E. may still be available on other sites and, if you can, I strongly suggest tracking it down instead. It's an annoying and frustrating business practice when a publisher adds things that actively harm the game, then forces you to buy them over the original, especially when it's nearly twice the price. An optional DLC would've been a far better choice here.\n\nHowever, Q.U.B.E. is still a good game and remains fair value for money, if it's on sale, it's a great buy.\n\n* A sequel, Q.U.B.E. 2 is being developed in the Unreal Engine 4, the details of which are being kept closely guarded","June 28, 2015","true","6.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Among the earliest of these was QUBE, an acronym I don't care to spell out (largely because I still do not know what it stands for) and a minimalistic puzzle game focused around manipulating the different properties of cubes as you make your way through a starkly colored labyrinth with a vast assortment of puzzles standing between you and your goal. It sounds familiar to be sure (change a few words and I am describing Portal almost exactly), but QUBE manages to set itself apart in the areas that matter, though ironically winds of bringing itself down in the end by playing things too close to the chest.\n\nThe parts that make QUBE interesting are also the ones most in need of some room to breath. Throughout your three hour trek through the mysterious structure you find yourself in, new mechanics are introduced and discarded with almost every other puzzle. This is good in the fact that you're constantly being given new tools to work with and new ways to think about how to progress through the level, but also a double edged sword in the fact that at least half the time you spend with a given mechanic is used up just figuring out how it works. Just when you get the handle on how to use one and feel you're ready for some more challenging puzzles, it's swapped out for something new which then restarts the learning process over again, repeating up until the very end.\n\nIt's not so bad as to make QUBE unenjoyable, but it does fall rather short in comparison to its contemporaries, and feels as if the developer felt they would only get one chance and as a result had to put every idea they had into this one game. It makes for a rather erratic experience that never quite finds its footing.\n\nThe most prominent addition to the director's cut version of QUBE is an entirely new narrative, but unfortunately it's as half-baked and tacked on as you would expect for something that was added years after the original game released. It's inoffensive and decently acted, but adds nothing to the experience except needless questions that go nowhere and some outrageously long elevator rides.\n\nQUBE isn't going to be remembered as a modern classic, perhaps not remembered at all, but for a first person puzzle game it's just decent enough to be worth checking out. The framework that's here could potentially be turned into a much better sequel, which hopefully is in the pipeline, but as it stands I don't regret the time I spent with the game in any way. If you've already played the original, feel free to pass up the director's cut. You aren't missing anything, and might in fact have a better experience playing the original sans the awkward story, left to create your own narrative out of the events transpiring.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","August 8, 2014","true","3.3"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Succeeding well for 90% of the task and then flopping miserably at the end, and that is sadly what the Director's Cut did.  The gameplay is identical in every way to the original version and is enjoyable as always; the only major change (in the story mode) is a refined "story," which as been added solely by the addition of voiceovers.  What's amazing is that they actually manage to set up a fairly interesting story, rife with contradictions (trying to remain spoiler-free here).  Unfortunately, when the entire game builds up a dichotomy of impressions, making you guess what is true and real, at the end, it falls flat.  You aren't given a choice, you're force to pick one of the impressions as "true," and the game unambiguously shows that you were correct.  This isn't even the ILLUSION of choice, this is shoe-horning us in to a meaningless ending.  It's like playing a puzzle game and simultaneously watching a completely unrelated movie; on the one hand you're playing a game, and on the other merely along for the ride as a dispassionate observer.  The protagonist's doubt isn't your own, because you don't ever act on it.  You're forced to just sit back and watch as he picks correctly.  As such, I can only say that you should play the non-director's cut version, 'cause honestly the game was better when it lacked story than when it insulted its players with this.","June 26, 2014","false","3.1"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

Some of the wording may be similiar from my Q.U.B.E review.\n\nGraphics: The graphics is blocks. No seriously...what were you expecting me to type? Anyways, the majority of the rooms you go through will be made of opaque white blocks. The blocks you can control are in colors. Yeah, that's it. Just to put it short, it is simple.\n\nDirector's Cut Graphics: In my previous review, some of the stuff gave me motion sickness. However, some areas such as twisting rooms and the rotating rooms are fixed to accomodate that. Also, there are extra rooms and designs so that you won't be walking the same path over and over. Overall, a good improvement in this version.\n\nControls: The controls are simple. You use your mouse buttons to either pull the cubes up or to push them back in. Also, there is jumping involved. The gravity is a little higher than normal fps games, like from valve.\n\nGameplay: The goal of the game is to find a way to the next room or to solve puzzles in order for the next room to open. There are various puzzles in the game. The puzzles are simply climbing up to the next room, directing a ball into a hole, dyeing a ball a certain color and putting that in a hole, magnets to move blocks, and using your memory to note where blocks are in the dark. It seems like a lot, but luckily, the game walks you through from the beginner stage to the intermediate.\n\nDirector's Cut Gameplay: In my previous review, I mentioned about that super hard magnet puzzle with the four small blocks. This puzzle was removed-thank goodness! Also, the difficulty curve has changed a bit, but in the more easy way. There are new puzzles and some puzzles removed. Still, an enjoyable experience for those who played the original Q.U.B.E game, or for those starting new.\n\nStory in Director's Cut: Finally! Some insight! The story has two people to guide you, the one to encourage you to complete and the other to stop what you're doing. However, the story is only in audio. However, there isn't much complexity in the story that will affect your gameplay or is required.\n\nMusic: The music of this game is mostly ambience. Now, depending for some, it can either be slightly annoying or relaxing. To me, it was relaxing (except when it came to that room I described above).\n\nMusic in Director's Cut: The music is a definite improvement. It's not just ambience this time, but actual music and beats to accompany.\n\nDLC: The DLC, "Against the Qlock," is a small expansion to the current game with new puzzles with pickups to make it more fun. The goal for each puzzle is to complete it with as few moves as possible and/or as fast as possible.\n\n\nIs this Portal?: While this game has an atmosphere feel and mechanics like the game, "Portal," it is not. The similiarities are, again the atmosphere and gameplay (excluding portals), using least amount of moves and completing the puzzles as fast as possible in the dlc, and the difficulty curve of the game. You may get a "Portal" vibe from this, but again, it is not.\n\nOverall: Q.U.B.E is another great action puzzle game that is a great addition to your library that is recommended to all, even to those who enjoy "Portal" or did not enjoy it.Regardless of how bland the interface looks, the gameplay stands up and shines in this game. The difficulty curve is great, with an exception of that one room. While the design of the game is simple, the puzzles introduced can be complexed and require thought. However, with training and a good amount of thinking, you can surely be "Quick" in "Understanding" of "Block Extrusion."\n\nOverall Director's Cut: Director's Cut is the much needed improvement from the original version of the game. With new puzzles, much needed fixes, music, and a story, this expansion is like reading the minds of the players who played the first game. While some people may be bummed out by missing the original game, there is no need for despair. It is mostly the same game, but with some modifications and new additions. Director's Cut is what Q.U.B.E should have been: An enjoyable, casual experience with various difficulty challenges for all.\n\nPros:\n-Great difficulty curve. From easy at the beginning to hard at the end.\n-Many unique puzzles.\n-With DLC, more puzzles and more challenges.\n\nPros for Director's Cut:\n-Hardest magnet puzzle removed\n-Difficulty curve improved.\n-New puzzles.\n-A story\n-Improvement on music\n\nCons:\n-No story.\n-Bland graphics. Majority of rooms are just white blocks.\n-That one magnet room. Yes, I will never stop talking about it.\n\nCons for Director's Cut:\n-Still some blandness for graphics, but not as bad as the previous.","April 2","true","14.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Recently, about a month ago, a revamped version of the game popped up in my library, so I decided to play the game again and see how it goes.\n\nQ.U.B.E. is a puzzle game, with a visual style that resembles Portal, and as such it was largely lauded as a Portal-esque by the majority of the gaming world. As a puzzler, the game is great, albeit it could be considered a bit short. You use cube-shaped blocks of various properties to beat the consecutive rooms. The mechanics are simple, but the puzzles are challenging, as it should be; I finished the main campaign in three hours, although I did leave some secrets unchecked. This was my second playthrough though, so I would estimate the first to take about twice as long.\n\nThe Director's Cut version added a story element, largely advertised by the developers... and unfortunately, it gives off a vibe of being a simple overlay on the original version of the game. The plot is mainly just snippets of voice transmission, and the information given to you by those voices is not only unconnected to the gameplay, but also a blatant attempt to evoke an emotional response... which is futile, as there is no relation between the story and the world the player is placed in. Not to mention that the whole story is just two characters trying to convince you that you are what they say you are, and the other person is lying. Not cool.\n\nThe Against the Qlock DLC, which added timed challenges and leaderboards, also seems to be part of this release. However the gameplay of the challenges seems... not very well thought out - without spoiling too much, the puzzle-solving mechanics of the single-player are not the optimal strategy; to get a good time, you need to collect power-ups. Some of them are mandatory, and some of them affect your time, mostly positively; abandoning the crux of the game to use simple power-ups doesn't seem like a good idea to me. Although, I guess contrary to Portal challenges there's a lot less freedom, and in consequence the puzzles are more streamlined, so they needed to introduce something that could speed up the gameplay.\n\nOverall... Having played the original Q.U.B.E., it was a good puzzler. The Director's Cut didn't add any value to the game; it might have arguably removed some (the cheesy plot ruins the ambience the game had before). I'd still recommend it on its current price. €1.49 is not a big ask, and the game is genuinely rewarding.

However, when moving from one puzzle to the next, you encounter some pretty huge monocromatic structures, very much like NaissancE.\n\nThe difference between this version and the previous, is the addition of a story, through voice-acting... I don't think the story is very well put together, in the context of the game, though. It's not bad, but I don't think it is very important, aside from giving the player a break between puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles are rather eclectic, drawing from several different types of puzzles. It certainly keeps things varied and interesting. Unfortunately, there will inevitably be sections with puzzles that many players may not like.\nA specific example I can give is some of the physics-driven puzzles... It's always the same problem: instead of very clear cause-effect, you sometimes get weird interactions that make the puzzle much harder and confusing than it should be.\nI'm also not a fan of sliding puzzles, of which there were a couple.\n\nOverall, nothing too bad! Most of the puzzles were pretty good! I liked it. Not much more to say about it, though.\n\nThe visuals are great, and the music sets a nice atmosphere. It's around 4 hours long to beat the main campaign, but there are some time-challenges and other secret puzzles hidden around that may let you take something more out of the game.\n\n\nFinally, I mentioned the story. Not to spoil too much, it's mostly trying to get doubt into the player's mind, by having 2 people trying to tell him different sides of the story, seemingly leading to a decision in the end. Unfortunately, the game was designed as a straightforward puzzle game. As a result, the story is literally a few lines of voice-acting between areas. It never affects the gameplay. The player never actually chooses anything. Never questions anything. Never explores around to find clues. Nothing.\nIt's just there! And what could be a cool thing, ended up being nothing at all.\nIt's purely a distraction.\n\nBut hey, this is all subjective. These were my impressions after playing through it.\nAlthough not as striking as either Portal nor NaissancE, it does manage a nice balance of both, and it's definitely a good game!

Worry not my friend, as this game proves that even you can make a good game if you try!\n\nPros: - Interesting mechanics. The cube mechanic is really interesting and would've been good for a level editor, missed opportunity.\n- Good visuals. It's very clean and looks very nice.\n- Hard puzzles.\n\nCons: - Hard puzzles. The puzzles may be a little bit too ♥♥♥♥ed up for a casual play, but if you're okay with this kind of game, you can ignore that.\n- Bad voice-acting and story. I would've prefered if it was completely silent, like, apparently, the original cut.\n- Cringy graphic options. It gives you limited options to change your graphic setup, so you need a mildly good PC to handle it since you can't tweak it to a less power-hungry setting. Claps for giving the Dynamic Lights option, even when it severely degrades the gaming experience, and giving the option to the player. But unfortunately, they forgot everything else. It runs roughly 20-25 fps on an Intel HD 5500/Intel i3 2.00GHz x 4 setup with Ubuntu 15.10.\n- Fullscreen options. And if things are already bad with the terribly limited console-like graphic options, they ♥♥♥♥ed with the fullscreen as well. The game won't run in any resolution lower than yours on fullscreen (at least on Ubuntu), which means you're SEVERELY limited if you don't have a good machine.\n\nOverall, the pros are really strong, but the cons as well, if you have a powerful machine, a brain for puzzles and can handle the voice-acting, it's a strong recommendation. If you want something better balanced, doesn't have a very powerful machine and is picky with voice-acting, I would recommend to take that Portal 2 out of the shelf.","December 29, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

After waking up in completely sterile room you hear a voice over the radio telling you that you are somewhere in space, and you probably lost you memory of why you're there or even who you are.

If you like Portal, you're going to like this, its mix of challenges and minimal style make it addictive and appealing to look at, because odds are if you’re good at first person puzzle games, you'll beat this in one sitting. The controls don’t feel constrictive nor are they over whelming, simply put; you have a glove that manipulates blocks on walls, which sounds easier than it is. If you aren't one to nit-pick, the story is interesting for what it's worth and the buildup towards the finally is beyond worth the wait. The voice acting is also impressive considering this is an indie game that costs less than half of a regular title while managing to look better too.\n\nVisuals: 9/10\nThe game does look good and when in optimal settings on the correct monitor looks near lifelike or at the very least will make you say "wow".\n\nStory: 8/10\nWith the game being about 3 hours the first play through, the story is more than adequate, keeping the player guessing as to what’s really going on while still being interesting and exciting.\n\nReplay ability: 7/10\nLike other games of the genre it has speed runs, but that’s really where it ends, the stories ok a second time through but it doesn’t have the same affect twice.\n\nChallenge: 8/10\nIt's unique, really. Being able to manipulate your surroundings isn’t anything super new or exiting, but the way it’s done is impressive. Some of the puzzles will be quite difficult the first time through while some are just down right fun and awesome, specifically the blue platforms. They aren’t so difficult that your get bored or angry nor are the too easy and just flat out lame.\nAs with all games, the first section is to get the player oriented while the levels afterwords will put your mind to work.\n\nWould I recommend this game? An overwhelming Yes. Unless you were sucked into the original by its lack of a story and explanation, buy this game. It's a perfect example of what can be done with a good idea and the right elements. Personally, id put this up there with Mirrors Edge, Portal, or any highly praised indie game. The story is there, along with the visuals and game play, especially being that this game is only $10, it’s not Portal, but it’s right there with it.\n\nSolid 9/10 all considered.\n\nMany many times better than most big budget games being released every year.\n","November 8, 2014","true","3.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

However, this is very much like the original game. The puzzles are the same. There are a few changes and minor additions. The only major difference between this version and the original is that this one has a narrative. If you already have the original, do not bother with this. If you do not have the original, I would recommend this as much or perhaps more (if you prefer a narrative) than the original. The reason why I am not recommending this version is because there are no subtitles, so I could not understand what was being said which made this game feel exactly like the original. Otherwise, if you are not hearing impaired or from a non-English background, I would recommend this over the original. If subtitles are added, I will change this review to recommended.","August 16, 2014","false","2.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I reccomend getting this version over the original as it comes with the DLC included, as well as some added content (new puzzles, achievements, and an actual story line with voice actors, which the original didn't have).\n\nPros:\n-Minimalistic. It's a nice break from games with complex intricate environments filled with detail. There's not much background noise to distract you.\n-Good puzzles. The hardest puzzles are a nice challenge but not super tough (imo). If spatial puzzles are your thing then don't expect to spend 30min stuck in a room.\n-Short. Again, a good break from that drawn out campaign you're going through in that other game. You can explore everything in the main game here in 3.5h or less. Secret areas included.\n-Against the Qlock. The DLC gives you a bunch of short challenges with a ton of achievements. They do have a stressful change of pace but you can play them in many ways.\n-Those elegant hands and forearms. I feel strangely attracted to them.\n-Cool environments. Not all of them but there's some screenshot/recording-worthy moments.\n\nCons:\n-Slapped on story. This version is basically the original with voice acting to give you some sense of story. Personally it rubbed me the wrong way. I prefered the mystery of not knowing anything (in a Myst like way) rather than feeling like I'm in a bad stereotyped American film. There were so many things that made no sense, so many plotholes.\n-Preformance issues? I'm not the only one. I'd like to see what the highest settings look like while still being able to have a good framerate (or is this just lag? I can't even tell). And this game doesn't demand much from the graphical part.\n-Linearity. While I like games to be linear when they do have a linear plot, it was confusing to reach the only part where the other characters instill you to make a choice and yet... there's no choice to be made. You just keep going forward. It becomes irrelevant whom you trust because there's only one way to progress in the game. Even if that's against your wishes.\n-Unpolished environment. Elements without collision. Invisible walls. Strange transitions in the secret areas.\n-Unskippable cutscenes. But hey, at least they are short. Unlike the slow and painful elevator rides added in so you'd listen to the monologues. I get what the developers were trying to do but I believe they went a bit overboard.\n\nAll in all I enjoyed itt. The story, as bad as it felt, was bad in a laughable way. There were gorgeous rooms and corridors to be seen. The athmosphere was serene and somewhat mysterious. And the puzzles were accessible enough while still having some challenge in them that you'd feel accomplished. Yes, there's a bunch of things that could be better but they don't take the fun away from this game.","January 22","true","5.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","4"

If you can buy it for 3 euro or less it's worth, any higher price is not suitable for this game.\n\nNow about the game:\n[+] The director's cut has some sort of a storyline added. The story is not very interesting, but it's more than nothing... at least you're not feeling that alone.\n[+] The game lets you figure everything out by yourself which is nice, finally a change from all those games who narrate you trough the whole game and tell you everything before you have the chance to think about it.\n[+] The design is pretty simple and clean.\n\n[- ] At the end of every chapter there is a bright white light flash... no idea why did they decide to put that? Bad choise... it really hurts the eyes.\n[- ] The game is short\n[- ] The game is pretty much over after you beat it once. There is some thing called "beat the clock" where you try to run and get to the finish line in time, but in my opinion it's very boring.\n\nThe game pretty much tries to look like portal - they kinda got it with the nice and neat rooms, but yet... kinda not there. Portal is the kind of game I can play more than once, Q.U.B.E is not. Again - if you can get this game for under 3 euro it's worth the 2 hours of fun.","September 6, 2014","false","3.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Low FOV (below 80, game runs at ~50-60) may cause a headache and nausea. It is also unacceptable to have such FOV in PC title.\n\nGame itself is interestic logic game with decent artistic style (however may feel repetetive after a while) and soundtrack. It lacks personality, homour, message to player that usually other games offer. Director's Cut adds commentary and story that doesn't make much sense, has blank spots in it and feels like was added without deeper thinking.\nPuzzles are alright, but very little. QUBE has to offer about 1,5-3,5 hours of entertaiment - for some it might be good enough, but other similar games like Antichamber offer simply more interesting gameplay and are not that short. With standard pricetag hard to call that good.","July 26, 2014","false","2.8"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

(Quick Understanding of Block Extrusion) was always a favorite puzzler of mine. While bordering on the whitewashed, clean, and scientific feel of Portal in the visuals department, it still stood out on it's own, with fun and intuitive extrusion mechanics that made solving every puzzle both a learning experience and a reward. Unfortunately, the first game always lacked one thing: a good narrative. It was unfortunate that, as the protagonist, you made your way in complete silence through the abstract yet immersive environment of Q.U.B.E.\n\nDirector's Cut addressed that.\n\nDirector's Cut adds a touching and suspenseful narrative to an otherwise excellent puzzle game, to great success. I played the whole thing in one sitting, and never once did my poor posterior get a break fron the grinding point of the edge of my seat. The narrative keeps you guessing until the very end, and in that reguard, I happily hail Directors Cut as an effective and evocative replacement to the original Q.U.B.E.\n\nNow get out there and start extruding!","June 9, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

More importantly it adds a narrative, You start the game with amnesia and a broken radio (which is a good way of explaining why the protagonist doesn't speak although waking up with amnesia is kind of clichéd, but whatever)\n\nTHe voice acting for the most part was surprisingly good, the male voice actor especially should be commended, however a few lines for the female VA were a little naff at times and I cringed at the part where she starts (she's a Astronaut/scientist by the way) crying when she heard 'God is dead'\n\nBoth characters try to convince you that they're telling the truth and the other person is lying, which they do both make good points, which led me to incredibly uncertain on who to trust.\n\nUnfortunately, there is only one ending this time around, which with both characters trying to persuade you, you'd think there would be two choices at the end.\n\nDue to the fact that you wake up with amnesia you aren't really told why or how you've got those gloves or what you are really doing there.\n\nDue to spoilers, I'll have to be pretty vague but apparently doing puzzles helps you 'complete your mission' (your mission is revealed about halfway through as the female on the radio explains every 30 minutes or so (depending on progression) once she has a clear signal to radio you).\n\nOverall, there are some improvements that are worthy of taking a look at if you have never played the original or if you are just curious. However, there isn't much to warrant a purchase if you have already spent the money on the original/DLC.\n\n","June 27, 2014","true","8.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You're manipulating (parts of) your environment rather than creating teleporters, but either way it's a really fun first-person physics puzzle game. My only complaint is that it's kinda short...hopefully one day we'll see a Q.U.B.E. 2.\n\nThis is the "Director's Cut" version of the game, which is almost exactly the same as the original, with the following differences:\n\n1) In the original, you're just by yourself with no idea of what's going on, where you are, why you're there, etc. The DC version has some "narration" that provides something of a plot. Whether this is a good thing is kinda a matter of personal preference; the game doesn't really need a plot, and some people like the mystery. Personally, I felt that it added an extra dimension to things, but I see where the other side is coming from; just look at the movie Blade Runner for an example of how adding a narration track can ruin the atmosphere.\n\n2) The hardest puzzle in the original game (Section 6 Puzzle 4, which corresponds to the original's "Tough Going, Part 2" achievement) is gone. Now, I can already hear the Super Meat Boy/Dark Souls fans who haven't played through Q.U.B.E. lamenting the "dumbing down", but trust me...this is a case for rejoicing and fanfare. The puzzle was really hard to begin with, which is fine; however, the game physics weren't (and still aren't, since that part of the engine hasn't been changed for the DC version) up to snuff for producing the required precision, so 75% of the time even when you did the puzzle correctly it still wouldn't work. For the curious, the DC version's "Tough Going" achievement is the same as the original game's "Tough Going, Part 1".\n\n3) A few extra puzzles (fun ones, but IMO no new noteworthy ones) and some "filler" areas were added to allow the narration to occur between puzzles without making the player stop.","May 29, 2014","true","3.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It kept me going, until I finished the game in one sitting. It took me 2-3 hours. For those who think that this is not enough, there are challenge missions to keep you busy for quite some time.\n\nBack to the story part, the story itself was good. It felt like a psychological/mystery thriller and not a predictable one! Also the whole game gives you a sense of isolation, even though there are people talking to you through your character's communication thingy.\n\nWhen it comes to the game's visual assets, the models look really good. The textures of the other hand vary. Your hands have great textures, the textures of the rooms look good too but they are really plain and simple and some textures are just ugly and look really old. Thankfully the ugly ones are rarely seen. Also, it run butter smooth on my machine (Quad Core @ 2.8GHz and a GTX450) with all the settings maxed up, unless the game had to render flames, when the fps dropped to hell.\n\nA problem I had with the game, was its lack of an FOV Slider. The stock FOV was really low for me and the only way to change it is by tweaking the game's files. I played it with the stock FOV and I got used to it, but I would have rather played it with something I find more comfortable.\n\nThe voice acting was excellent! I was really surprised by its quality! Especially the main two characters where completely believable and full of emotions. And the music really set the tone of the game, spooking you out all the way, start to end.\n\nFinally, the puzzles themselves where really varied. You did not have enough time to get bored of one kind, because a new one appeared, taking the spotlight, until the next one appeared. Sadly, I considered them to be on the easy side, but I had the same problem with Portal 2, so if you've played that, expect a similar experience.\n\nThe game seems to have been heavily influenced by Portal, at least during it's really early stages. Despite that, it manages to differentiate itself, slowly at the start and stronger as the plot moves on.\n\n\n\nTL:DR\n\nPuzzles: 7.5/10, Aesthetic: 10/10, Graphics: 6.5/10, Music: 8/10, Voice Acting 10/10.\nOverall a must play if you like Puzzles and thriller-like stories. 101% worth its full price.","June 12, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I honestly don't like the Director's Cut better than the original. Maybe it was because I enjoyed the ambience of the game with its soundtrack playing and the light sounds of blocks shifting back and forth. Now they have added people speaking in the game. You never speak, some woman at the ISS speaks for you because your radio is broken and you can't send out, you can listen, though. All characters talk too much about faith and god when really I kind of just wanted to solve some puzzles. So the story is lackluster, gameplay feels a little better and would probably be extremely fun with the Oculus Rift, but the story still takes a bite into the gameplay. Also, there is a happy ending, you have no control over this. I would have felt better if the game sent me into a deep fryer than pushing me out in space like it did in the original.\n\nAll in all, it isn't bad, just feels a little more shallow even if it does have more stuff. There's a legitimate time trial and the voice actors feel human, but their portrayal feels off. It doesn't feel right for me, but hey, now we have new levels and we can try to beat the leaderboards.","May 26, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On the other hand, you (afaik) have to use an invisible block to get that achievement in the last level, which I find really dumb.","October 8, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But judging by my playtime I seemed to have been very good at it.  Maybe it's that I'm good at puzzle games.  Or it could be that I had a natural intuition for the mechanics.  Either way, I could imagine that some people who aren't as good at puzzle games as I am would have trouble and wind up having double the amount of playtime I had.  The most troubling thing for me is the pacing of this game.  I understand that part of that is for the sake of the puzzles, but it really could've been made a bit faster so that we don't feel like we're plowing through molasses.\n\nWhat I don't understand is why people compare this game to Portal other than the fact that they're both first-person puzzlers (well, this game is more of a puzzle-platformer than a puzzler, but I digress).  Let's be clear: this game is very different from Portal.  It has no portals, unlike Antichamber for instance, and it has no buttons and very few lasers, and so the puzzle mechanics are flat out different.  That being said, I will say that this game resembles Portal in its tiled and behind-the-scenes environments.  But even there you'll find differences, I can guarantee you.\n\nAnd speaking of game mechanics, there are 5 main mechanics in this game, but there are also plenty more underused ones, encountered in the latter half of the game.\n\nNext up: the story.  It's a simple story told through two voices — not entirely unheard of.  At times it did make me wonder what the ending was going to be, but otherwise it only helped enhance the increasingly bleak and freaky environment in the latter portion of the game.\n\nThe UI was simple — perhaps too simple.  Even Antichamber (another UDK game) had more flexibility.  At least it had some basics.\n\nOverall: 7.5/10\n\nUPDATE: I just realized that this game include the Against The Qlock DLC as part of its deal, so now you can complete all of the achievements if you try hard enough.  However I have to say that this game, with its semi-irresponsive clicking, is not particularly friendly for speedrunning.  If I could post a review there as well I would.  At any rate, don't let this discourage you from the main game.\n\nUPDATE 2: Now I recently saw some playthroughs of the original Q.U.B.E.  I only wish I could've been able to buy that version on Steam instead of the Director's Cut, as it seemed was better.","January 18","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The basic gist of the game is that you have a pair of gloves that allow you push and pull blocks in and out of the walls of the strange location you are in. The game adds new mechanics throughout the experience to keep things fresh, and the puzzles are consistantly excellent. If you enjoy first-person physics puzzle games such as Portal and Quantum Conundrum, you'll undoubtedly like this. The Director's cut adds the previously released time trial DLC, and adds a storyline to the main campaign (the original Q.U.B.E. didn't have any kind of plot). The new story isn't anything earth-shattering, but it is interesting and the voice acting is very well done, so it's a pleasant addition to the game. In terms of gameplay differences, I believe they changed one or two of the harder puzzles (there was one I remember being extremely frustrated with in the original, but I didn't come across it in the director's cut), but it's mostly the same. Overall, this game comes highly reccomended for any fan of puzzle games.","June 2, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However this game is no Portal.  The narrator has none of GLADOS's charm, the story (The game takes place in some sort of asteroid hurtling toward Earth and the PC has amnesia apearently) is just pain-inducing awful, to the point where I muted the narrator even at the cost of potentially missing vital clues just to make it stop.  The puzzles start out fine, but halfway through you get into a lot of rolling ball puzzles that require precise timing that the controls just don't support well enough.  Overall, the "pile of shifting white cubes" loses its appeal very quickly and you are left with a very very bland environment.  I'm having a hard time believing it myself, but I really dislike this game despite the fact that it should have been right up my alley.

So I eagerly fired it up, but oh no. Ohhh noooo. It's like they had a competition to fit as many bad storytelling tropes as they could into a game that *doesn't have a story*. Now there's a poorly-acted disembodied voice in your ear telling you what to do. You have amnesiea. You've very important. Follow their instructions. Oh, and did I mention that they SPOIL THE ENDING WITHIN THE FIRST THREE MINUTES OF THE GAME.\n\nI cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would have thought this was an okay thing to do. It's a horrible and unecesscary perversion to what was very nearly a perfect little game.

The mechanics are the same, most of the areas are the same, and they even added a couple new areas. The block extrusion mechanic makes for some rigid (yet still thought provoking) puzzles, that have a decent amount of variety to them. A lot of the environment is very reminiscient of Portal, but it does still have its own feel, and the way the facility operates is certainly unique.\n\nThe narration, though (The main focus of the Director's Cut) is cringe-worthy. It is as cliched as possible (You have amnesia, your communications are out, you're on a mission to save the world), with plenty of cheesy one-liners. The story is flat, incredibly direct, and offers very few moments of mystery. It very rarely gives you reason to care for the characters, and emotional scenes are thrown in abruptly, for the sake of emotion.\n\nWhile the original version slowly unfolded the story in pieces as you explored your environment, and left everything open, this version just throws exposition at you around every corner. It even takes the ultimate reveal at the end of the original, and makes it common knowledge, presented to you at the very beginning.\n\nI do not want to recommend this game. If the original was still for sale, I would recommend that instead. But this game still contains the Q.U.B.E. experience, and it comes bundled with the DLC, so that's nice.

Puzzles are mostly straight forward, and you can just muddle your way through most of them. Rarely got that nice "puzzlegasm" you get on a good puzzle game when you are mid-puzzle and the penny drops and you realize your current approach is all wrong, and that there's a whole other aspect to the puzzle. A well designed puzzle has a journey - from confusion, experimenting, semi-understanding, more experiementing, full-understanding. There was hardly any of that. Often I felt disappointed to solve a puzzle - I was overcome with a sense of "Oh, was that it?".\n\nBuggy in parts, you and blocks can stick to walls at times.\n\nNever played the original.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharvath/recommended/239430/","sharvath","Sharvath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharvath/","287 products in account","Q.U.B.E. is a first-person puzzle game in which the player will mostly push or pull color-coded blocks from the walls, ceilings, and floors. New concepts are introduced often to keep the gameplay fresh. The early mechanics form a strong foundation for the remainder of the game, but Q.U.B.E. loses some momentum in the mid-game by continually introducing and dropping concepts which are either obvious time-sinks or perhaps rely too heavily on a finnicky physics engine. The developers finally hit their stride in the end-game, but then the whole package just hits a brick wall.\n\nThe Director's Cut had one curious addition:  a story. The original Q.U.B.E. was pure gameplay. Here's a puzzle. Solve it (or don't). This version tries to play on themes of isolation, desperation, and paranoia by adding voiceovers (which are actually quite well-done); however, no gameplay alterations were made, aside from extending a few hallways. This seems like a mistake for a game which already had pacing issues.\n\nTo make matters worse, the story never commits to its motifs. There was already a mark beside "isolation"; it's a first-person puzzle game! "Desperation" comes in the form of "The Earth's in danger." and of couse, "Oh no! Your wife is on Earth!" Yawn. "Paranoia" was handled with a bit more grace, but you're expecting a payoff. You'll carry that expectation right up to the end. The story will suggest a fork in the road, but the game will present only one obvious path. You'll search high and low and wait while anticipating a time-based trigger, but you'll slowly realize that your options remain the same as ever. Play the game (or don't).\n\nDespite the bad pacing and one puzzle which was almost completely broken by the physics engine, I would recommend this game if you're a fan of Portal. The end-game puzzles aren't terribly difficult, but they do have a lot of moving pieces and therefore require a bit of thought. The developers knew their limitations; outside of the bundled "Against the Qlock" DLC, there's very little demand for twitch reflexes. The DLC seems to have promise, but I probably won't spend too much time with it. I don't enjoy time trials very much.","February 3, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/239430/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","Personally I feel this is superior to the original on a few merits.\n1. The worst puzzle in the game is gone.\n2. The DLC is bundled with the main game, so it's a cheaper price for the same content.\nOtherwise, it realy is the same game.\n\nThe main game I've discussed before but I'll talk about briefly; it's a competent enough Portal-clone with a variety of decent puzzle ideas but little in the way of originality, it uses standard puzzle logic and you'll have no problems figuring things out, it's on the easy side of things. Unlike Portal, Antichamber, etc. there's no original mechanics introduced, just... sliding blocks. Not that it's a bad thing! What it does, it does well, and some of the cube constructs look pretty neat.\nThe narrative feels kind of forced into the game and some of it they actually had to add slow-moving elevators for, apparently, dragging out the puzzle-less sections even longer. Fortunately the narration also fills in what were previously dead sections and gives some context. There's an interesting theme of faith vs. doubt going on the whole way through but the issue is that, as Q.U.B.E. is a game with one ending, there's no real weight to it especially if you've played through the game before, because you know how it's going to end either way. I don't mind it and I don't have a preference between the lonely atmosphere of the original and the narrative of this version. It's fine.\nThe DLC levels attempt to make the game more like a speedrunning game, while still retaining a lot of the elements from the main game. It becomes a puzzle to figure out how to get all the time-saving pickups and figuring out the fastest route through levels (or puzzling out the route that uses the least moves.) The levels all have some flavor to them and do really interesting things with the game's mechanics, I was pretty impressed by the level design.\nUNFORTUNATELY. The game's mechanic's also aren't very well suited to this kind of speedrunning thing. There is a pretty decent delay between any input you make, the base character speed is sluggish, and the cursor is tiny. One slight miss can completely destroy a speedrun attempt and it gets rather frustrating rather fast. Especially when it looks like you hit the powerup/block/switch you were aiming for (with the glow that appears showing right on an edge) but the game says you haven't. I think it would've been in their best interests to alter the mechanics slightly for the DLC, because the main game on its own is fine, and the DLC's content itself is fine, but the mechanical flaws of the main game don't suit the DLC levels very well.\nThere's also the issue of having quite a number of grindy achievements that basically don't respect the player's time at all. Play 500 DLC levels? The shortest still takes some 40-50 seconds, so that would double my playtime just to do, practically. Walk 100000 meters? I only barely made 10% of that going for all the main achievements, I wouldn't dare imagine how long hitting 10000 would take; over 150 plays of the last level, I guess, which sounds like torture (and would also take some 2-2.5 minutes per run... also quite a lot of extra playtime. 10000 pickups? Again, I barely made 1000 going for all the main achievements. These kinds of achievements are pointless time-wasters not in the slightest worth grinding it out for, kind of irked that this will forever sit as unfinished simply because I refuse to waste that much time on this game.\nThe problems are kinda nitpicks, yeah, but they matter to some people (like myself) and overall it's still a good game, though not a great one.","January 26, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SinfulSorcerer/recommended/239430/","SinfulSorcerer","Sinful Sorcerer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SinfulSorcerer/","631 products in account","A puzzling adventure similar in premise to portal but with focus on cube manipulation rather than portals. The game uses several different cube types, all designated their own colour to quickly and efficiently let the player know how to interact with them. Red cubes can be extracted or retracted three times, allowing for you to build bridges or tower-like structures with them. The yellow cubes form a ladder when interacted with, the side you choose to left click will always be the longest with the other two nearby cubes forming steps. Blue cubes work as trampolines and can send both you and other cubes or objects flying. Purple cubes rotate the area they are attached to, this includes other cubes. Finally, green cubes form a boxlike object which you can push around or transport with the help of other cubes. Think of it as the companion cube from Portal but with less personality.\n\nThere are also some puzzles which use balls that are sent rolling as they spawn, in these circumstances you are to transport the ball throughout a maze, often by making it go through different colour cubes to change its colour and thereby making it react properly with a certain coloured goal. Colour mixing and laser puzzles do also appear but in limited quantities.\n\nWhat sets this Director's Cut appart from the original Q.U.B.E is the narrative. The standard edition had no focused story at all, and was instead simply a collection of puzzles taking you through an unknown and strange place eventually bringing you to the game's climax. Here however, the developers hired a writer and some voice actors to formulate a narrative story piece fitting the game's gameplay and pacing, and hopefully bringing the player a deeper satisfaction as to why he/she would complete these puzzles in the first place.\n\nDoes the narrative succeed with its goal? I believe this is highly subjective, and I've seen both much positive and negative feedback regarding the story. A lot of people are calling it bland, and I certainly can't say it matches the story of Portal 2 in terms of character development or pacing, but it is there and it somewhat does its job. The story, without spoiling too much, tries to give your character, well; character. You are told that what you are doing is for the purpose of saving the world, and that you may not remember anything because you have been out for far too long. Soon however another voice appears and tells you not to believe "their" lies. The player gets more and more information the longer the game goes, and the more puzzles you solve the more hectic the whole situation seems to become. Before you know it you got two sides calling each other liars, and you are to choose who to believe.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that, although I rather liked the story itself, and it did make the game more interesting for me personally, the ending was very poorly implemented for the story. I think that they should have either changed the ending and given you more options as to how to end the game, or rewritten the story's climax to better fit the game's ending. In the end it feels like no matter who you choose to believe, you are simply left with no choice but to follow the game's "canon" ending, which makes no sense at all if you believed the other side.\n\nIf the game's climax had made more sense as regard to the story, or at least given you two choices as to how you wanted to end the game I would definitely recommend this. As it stands however; the payoff is really a letdown. And I therefore believe you are more likely to enjoy the standard edition, which has no story at all, and make up your own story instead if you wish, rather than playing along with their story and being forced down one path despite the game hinting towards two endings throughout the entire experience.\n\nI recommend you try out the original Q.U.B.E instead. It is an excellent puzzle game and the only real gripe I have with it is that the physics engine sometimes seems to malfunction slightly which can lead to frustration and having to redo puzzles. Overall, a great game which should satisfy your puzzle-itch for a few 2-3 hours.","April 4, 2015","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't finish the game because of these puzzles and if you look at the achievements I'm probably not the only one having this problem - only half of the people who made it through sector 5 also made it through 6.\n\nSeems like the game has 7 sectors, so it doesn't seem to be very long (I made it halfway through sector 6 within 2 hours).

Portal portal PORTAL! Besides the obvious comparison this is not a bad little game.\n\nIn Q.U.B.E. you have a pair of magical-science gloves that can manipulate a series of coloured cubes with various different properties e.g. red cubes just extend out as platforms, yellow cubes a series of three platforms, blue launching anything that touches it etc... While this may sound greatly varied they are, for better or worse, mostly just variants on platforms. As the game progresses more interesting items appear such as coloured balls that need depositing in pits, rotating rooms, rooms with lightswitches (more interesting then it sounds) and the ability to change cubes to whatever colour you choose.\nDespite all these fun sounding mechanics, the game is visually a very sterile white consistently. While Portal was mostly sterile, there were moments where you had variations in the chamber and moments where you could go behind the chambers, in Q.U.B.E. it remains almost exclusively cold white rooms. Late in the game things break up a little , but not to a great extent.\n\nThe Director's Cut version adds both a narration via two characters talking to you via a radio, never fully being seen in game, and also changes some of the chambers layouts around. The naration helps to a degree as, with the first version, I found myself getting bored of the repetative rooms with no context. While it can be seen as a boon, it almost instantly breaks the late game twists by telling you right away what is going on, though it does provide a nice conflict for the player that is only answered at the end of the game.\n\nA recommendation for a rainy day as (I'M MENTIONING PORTAL AGAIN) with the first Portal game it is very short.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/239430/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","Personally I feel this is superior to the original on a few merits.\n1. The worst puzzle in the game is gone.\n2. The DLC is bundled with the main game, so it's a cheaper price for the same content.\nOtherwise, it realy is the same game.\n\nThe main game I've discussed before but I'll talk about briefly; it's a competent enough Portal-clone with a variety of decent puzzle ideas but little in the way of originality, it uses standard puzzle logic and you'll have no problems figuring things out, it's on the easy side of things. Unlike Portal, Antichamber, etc. there's no original mechanics introduced, just... sliding blocks. Not that it's a bad thing! What it does, it does well, and some of the cube constructs look pretty neat.\nThe narrative feels kind of forced into the game and some of it they actually had to add slow-moving elevators for, apparently, dragging out the puzzle-less sections even longer. Fortunately the narration also fills in what were previously dead sections and gives some context. There's an interesting theme of faith vs. doubt going on the whole way through but the issue is that, as Q.U.B.E. is a game with one ending, there's no real weight to it especially if you've played through the game before, because you know how it's going to end either way. I don't mind it and I don't have a preference between the lonely atmosphere of the original and the narrative of this version. It's fine.\nThe DLC levels attempt to make the game more like a speedrunning game, while still retaining a lot of the elements from the main game. It becomes a puzzle to figure out how to get all the time-saving pickups and figuring out the fastest route through levels (or puzzling out the route that uses the least moves.) The levels all have some flavor to them and do really interesting things with the game's mechanics, I was pretty impressed by the level design.\nUNFORTUNATELY. The game's mechanic's also aren't very well suited to this kind of speedrunning thing. There is a pretty decent delay between any input you make, the base character speed is sluggish, and the cursor is tiny. One slight miss can completely destroy a speedrun attempt and it gets rather frustrating rather fast. Especially when it looks like you hit the powerup/block/switch you were aiming for (with the glow that appears showing right on an edge) but the game says you haven't. I think it would've been in their best interests to alter the mechanics slightly for the DLC, because the main game on its own is fine, and the DLC's content itself is fine, but the mechanical flaws of the main game don't suit the DLC levels very well.\nThere's also the issue of having quite a number of grindy achievements that basically don't respect the player's time at all. Play 500 DLC levels? The shortest still takes some 40-50 seconds, so that would double my playtime just to do, practically. Walk 100000 meters? I only barely made 10% of that going for all the main achievements, I wouldn't dare imagine how long hitting 10000 would take; over 150 plays of the last level, I guess, which sounds like torture (and would also take some 2-2.5 minutes per run... also quite a lot of extra playtime. 10000 pickups? Again, I barely made 1000 going for all the main achievements. These kinds of achievements are pointless time-wasters not in the slightest worth grinding it out for, kind of irked that this will forever sit as unfinished simply because I refuse to waste that much time on this game.\nThe problems are kinda nitpicks, yeah, but they matter to some people (like myself) and overall it's still a good game, though not a great one.","January 26, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would recommend checking out the Quick Look here for an idea of what the game mechanics and the game's aesthetic are like:\n\nhttp://www.giantbomb.com/videos/quick-look-qube/2300-5504/\n\nAll that said, I was pleasantly surprised and happy with the overall experience.  The puzzles have a nice progression and do get a little gnarly closer to the end of the game but when you do reach the solution, it makes you feel really smart in a fashion puzzles in Portal will make you feel after acheiving the solution.\n\nOne interesting thing about solving the puzzles is sometimes the solutions feel a bit analog because of how the physics in the game behave.  As such, there may be times where you're solving a puzzle and abusing the game engine's physics with how a ball may roll or a cube may slide on surfaces but it's an interesting feeling because as you become more familiar with how the game behaves, it feels more like manipulating materials than it does solving some surgically precise and sterile solution.\n\nFinally, the Director's Cut does add more story that was missing in the original Q.U.B.E..  The story does a good job of adding flavor to the puzzle solving experience and acts as a catalyst in keeping your interest atop the good puzzle design this game presents to you.\n\nIf you want a nice ~3 hour diversion with challenging first person puzzles, Q.U.B.E.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SinfulSorcerer/recommended/239430/","SinfulSorcerer","Sinful Sorcerer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SinfulSorcerer/","631 products in account","A puzzling adventure similar in premise to portal but with focus on cube manipulation rather than portals. The game uses several different cube types, all designated their own colour to quickly and efficiently let the player know how to interact with them. Red cubes can be extracted or retracted three times, allowing for you to build bridges or tower-like structures with them. The yellow cubes form a ladder when interacted with, the side you choose to left click will always be the longest with the other two nearby cubes forming steps. Blue cubes work as trampolines and can send both you and other cubes or objects flying. Purple cubes rotate the area they are attached to, this includes other cubes. Finally, green cubes form a boxlike object which you can push around or transport with the help of other cubes. Think of it as the companion cube from Portal but with less personality.\n\nThere are also some puzzles which use balls that are sent rolling as they spawn, in these circumstances you are to transport the ball throughout a maze, often by making it go through different colour cubes to change its colour and thereby making it react properly with a certain coloured goal. Colour mixing and laser puzzles do also appear but in limited quantities.\n\nWhat sets this Director's Cut appart from the original Q.U.B.E is the narrative. The standard edition had no focused story at all, and was instead simply a collection of puzzles taking you through an unknown and strange place eventually bringing you to the game's climax. Here however, the developers hired a writer and some voice actors to formulate a narrative story piece fitting the game's gameplay and pacing, and hopefully bringing the player a deeper satisfaction as to why he/she would complete these puzzles in the first place.\n\nDoes the narrative succeed with its goal? I believe this is highly subjective, and I've seen both much positive and negative feedback regarding the story. A lot of people are calling it bland, and I certainly can't say it matches the story of Portal 2 in terms of character development or pacing, but it is there and it somewhat does its job. The story, without spoiling too much, tries to give your character, well; character. You are told that what you are doing is for the purpose of saving the world, and that you may not remember anything because you have been out for far too long. Soon however another voice appears and tells you not to believe "their" lies. The player gets more and more information the longer the game goes, and the more puzzles you solve the more hectic the whole situation seems to become. Before you know it you got two sides calling each other liars, and you are to choose who to believe.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that, although I rather liked the story itself, and it did make the game more interesting for me personally, the ending was very poorly implemented for the story. I think that they should have either changed the ending and given you more options as to how to end the game, or rewritten the story's climax to better fit the game's ending. In the end it feels like no matter who you choose to believe, you are simply left with no choice but to follow the game's "canon" ending, which makes no sense at all if you believed the other side.\n\nIf the game's climax had made more sense as regard to the story, or at least given you two choices as to how you wanted to end the game I would definitely recommend this. As it stands however; the payoff is really a letdown. And I therefore believe you are more likely to enjoy the standard edition, which has no story at all, and make up your own story instead if you wish, rather than playing along with their story and being forced down one path despite the game hinting towards two endings throughout the entire experience.\n\nI recommend you try out the original Q.U.B.E instead. It is an excellent puzzle game and the only real gripe I have with it is that the physics engine sometimes seems to malfunction slightly which can lead to frustration and having to redo puzzles. Overall, a great game which should satisfy your puzzle-itch for a few 2-3 hours.","April 4, 2015","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a physics puzzler with inconsistent physics. You need to know this right off the bat because some puzzles require physics-based thinking and the game doesn't behave the same way in each attempt. You can literally get stuck on some puzzles because you will be unable to make pieces move where you want them to move.\n\nBUT after finishing the game I can see the light in this game. Yes, it's trying to be Portal but out of all the Portal clones this one is pretty good, despite being only a few hours. The story pulls through and mechanics are easily memorable. Definitely worth getting on sale, but again, remember you may face frustration from the physics.","April 2, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharvath/recommended/239430/","sharvath","Sharvath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharvath/","287 products in account","Q.U.B.E. is a first-person puzzle game in which the player will mostly push or pull color-coded blocks from the walls, ceilings, and floors. New concepts are introduced often to keep the gameplay fresh. The early mechanics form a strong foundation for the remainder of the game, but Q.U.B.E. loses some momentum in the mid-game by continually introducing and dropping concepts which are either obvious time-sinks or perhaps rely too heavily on a finnicky physics engine. The developers finally hit their stride in the end-game, but then the whole package just hits a brick wall.\n\nThe Director's Cut had one curious addition:  a story. The original Q.U.B.E. was pure gameplay. Here's a puzzle. Solve it (or don't). This version tries to play on themes of isolation, desperation, and paranoia by adding voiceovers (which are actually quite well-done); however, no gameplay alterations were made, aside from extending a few hallways. This seems like a mistake for a game which already had pacing issues.\n\nTo make matters worse, the story never commits to its motifs. There was already a mark beside "isolation"; it's a first-person puzzle game! "Desperation" comes in the form of "The Earth's in danger." and of couse, "Oh no! Your wife is on Earth!" Yawn. "Paranoia" was handled with a bit more grace, but you're expecting a payoff. You'll carry that expectation right up to the end. The story will suggest a fork in the road, but the game will present only one obvious path. You'll search high and low and wait while anticipating a time-based trigger, but you'll slowly realize that your options remain the same as ever. Play the game (or don't).\n\nDespite the bad pacing and one puzzle which was almost completely broken by the physics engine, I would recommend this game if you're a fan of Portal. The end-game puzzles aren't terribly difficult, but they do have a lot of moving pieces and therefore require a bit of thought. The developers knew their limitations; outside of the bundled "Against the Qlock" DLC, there's very little demand for twitch reflexes. The DLC seems to have promise, but I probably won't spend too much time with it. I don't enjoy time trials very much.","February 3, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/239430/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","Personally I feel this is superior to the original on a few merits.\n1. The worst puzzle in the game is gone.\n2. The DLC is bundled with the main game, so it's a cheaper price for the same content.\nOtherwise, it realy is the same game.\n\nThe main game I've discussed before but I'll talk about briefly; it's a competent enough Portal-clone with a variety of decent puzzle ideas but little in the way of originality, it uses standard puzzle logic and you'll have no problems figuring things out, it's on the easy side of things. Unlike Portal, Antichamber, etc. there's no original mechanics introduced, just... sliding blocks. Not that it's a bad thing! What it does, it does well, and some of the cube constructs look pretty neat.\nThe narrative feels kind of forced into the game and some of it they actually had to add slow-moving elevators for, apparently, dragging out the puzzle-less sections even longer. Fortunately the narration also fills in what were previously dead sections and gives some context. There's an interesting theme of faith vs. doubt going on the whole way through but the issue is that, as Q.U.B.E. is a game with one ending, there's no real weight to it especially if you've played through the game before, because you know how it's going to end either way. I don't mind it and I don't have a preference between the lonely atmosphere of the original and the narrative of this version. It's fine.\nThe DLC levels attempt to make the game more like a speedrunning game, while still retaining a lot of the elements from the main game. It becomes a puzzle to figure out how to get all the time-saving pickups and figuring out the fastest route through levels (or puzzling out the route that uses the least moves.) The levels all have some flavor to them and do really interesting things with the game's mechanics, I was pretty impressed by the level design.\nUNFORTUNATELY. The game's mechanic's also aren't very well suited to this kind of speedrunning thing. There is a pretty decent delay between any input you make, the base character speed is sluggish, and the cursor is tiny. One slight miss can completely destroy a speedrun attempt and it gets rather frustrating rather fast. Especially when it looks like you hit the powerup/block/switch you were aiming for (with the glow that appears showing right on an edge) but the game says you haven't. I think it would've been in their best interests to alter the mechanics slightly for the DLC, because the main game on its own is fine, and the DLC's content itself is fine, but the mechanical flaws of the main game don't suit the DLC levels very well.\nThere's also the issue of having quite a number of grindy achievements that basically don't respect the player's time at all. Play 500 DLC levels? The shortest still takes some 40-50 seconds, so that would double my playtime just to do, practically. Walk 100000 meters? I only barely made 10% of that going for all the main achievements, I wouldn't dare imagine how long hitting 10000 would take; over 150 plays of the last level, I guess, which sounds like torture (and would also take some 2-2.5 minutes per run... also quite a lot of extra playtime. 10000 pickups? Again, I barely made 1000 going for all the main achievements. These kinds of achievements are pointless time-wasters not in the slightest worth grinding it out for, kind of irked that this will forever sit as unfinished simply because I refuse to waste that much time on this game.\nThe problems are kinda nitpicks, yeah, but they matter to some people (like myself) and overall it's still a good game, though not a great one.","January 26, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stormapocalypse/recommended/239430/","stormapocalypse","Storm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stormapocalypse/","381 products in account","SummaryQ.U.B.E. is a fun puzzle game that aesthetically reminds me of Portal, but overall functions differently. I'd give it a 7/10, and would only recommend purchasing if it drops to 3 dollars or less. The game is ridiculously short, and it took me about 2 hours to beat (Left it running in the background for 1 hour while I did some stuff). It's a great game out of a bundle, and I'd comfortably purchase it at 2 dollars.\n\nGraphics-\nThe sterile environments in Q.U.B.E. are immediately pleasing to the eye, and the first thing I honestly tried to do was shoot portals from my hands when I began the game. Every new puzzle element you unlock is very fun to look at, every chamber opens in a cool way that makes me feel like I'm in a gigantic Rubik's Cube. The lighting is done fantastically, and lights the mood pretty well from chamber to chamber.\n\nSound-\nWhile the little beeps and boops aren't anything to write home about, they're spot on what they should be. The voice acting is actually done quite well, which impressed me. I'm not one for dramatic storylines in my puzzle games, but the actors were semi believable, especially towards the end. The only thing I'd wish they'd done differently is have a couple more sliders in the audio options. There's only a master volume slider for overall volume, which would be fine if they had normalized some of the dialog. It's not a huge problem, but you'll notice especially at the end of the game that the music is a little too loud and the dialog is a tad too soft. Overall nothing too worrisome, just my 2 cents.\n\nStory-\nQ.U.B.E. really tried its best to create a dramatic storyline where you are the hero, but all in all falls flat with the sheer absurdity of it. Don't get me wrong, the game's pretty fun, but at every moment that the story tries to reel you in, it immediately reminds you how ridiculous the whole ordeal is. Spoilers - You're in a gigantic puzzle cube hurling towards the Earth. By completing puzzles inside the cube, you break the cube and save the earth. The whole thing is ludicrous. Like the parts you break off wouldn't hurl like meteors into Earth's atmosphere. Like there would be a giant death cube in space with literally no origin story besides "oh no, the giant death cube!"\n\nThe biggest issue I have with the game is the idea that they plant into your head that there are two endings. There are not two endings. You have 2 people in your ear at all times telling you that there are two options, and there just are not. There is a point at the very end of the game where you are to literally walk into something that completes the game, and there is someone telling you to do something else. When you try to listen to him, nothing happens. I even looked it up to see if I was being stupid, and I was not (this time). The whole thing is ridiculous. Spoilers- Especially the line, "The president is on the line for you!" I immediately thought "no way, this is wrong. There's another option here that I'm missing."\n\nDifficulty-\nI'm not a puzzle game connoisseur by any means. I immensely enjoyed both Portal games and the Talos Principle, but I do not actively seek puzzle games out. That being said, the puzzles in this game were pretty simple. Although a lot of the base concepts were pretty fun and unique, they were all pretty easy to breeze through. There were maybe two or three times where I had to sit and think hard about the solution, and the rest was pretty much "ah, red here, blue here, green here". I think that most of the difficulty actually came via the player's own mechanical capabilities rather than using your brain to get through the puzzles. Oftentimes, I immediately saw the solution, but had troubles trying to press the buttons fast enough to get it to work. It actually would not be that big of an issue if the buttons worked immediately when I pressed them. Sometimes the buttons would pop when I wanted them to, sometimes there was a tiny bit of lag that between my press and the actual event occuring, which is beyond infuriating. Either way, that artificial difficulty only delayed the game's completion by maybe 20-30 more minutes overall.\n\nI honestly feel that artificial difficulty is the way this game lasts as long as it does. It's not so much that the puzzles are super hard, it's just the tedium of trying to get everything to respond the way you want it to. Don't get me wrong, the game is NOT a laggy mess. It's done rather well, it just has a few minor issues that wear on you as you play. Beyond that, sometimes puzzles are just tedious to be tedious. Minor spoilers- For example, at the end of the game, you gain the ability to more or less "make puzzles". Now that in mind, the possibilities when solving a puzzle immediately become greater in number, or at least they SHOULD. But because the devs wanted you to solve the puzzles in a pretty specific way, it's hard to do what you want to do, even if it would normally work. Case in point, I wanted a ball to pop up into the air, hit the wall and bank shot off of it into the hole. But in this particular room, physics didn't work the way they should, and the ball refused to bank off the wall.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend the game if you enjoy puzzles and have a couple hours to kill one day. Again, I can't recommend it at full price, but is a great value in a bundle.","January 19","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game presents pleasantly sterile puzzling environments, while still succesfully introducing a plot and some story development to the player. The dialogue is very well written, and the little nudges to cause the player to think about the scenario a little bit are welcome and often provide a great base for further thought, beyond the game's scope. Throughout the game, little bits of information are fed to the player at regular intervals, but they provide more questions instead of answering them and serve to build up to a powerful conclusion, without becoming boring on the way. The puzzle mechanics are nice and mostly function correctly, although they're not very complex and might quickly become boring to puzzling enthusiasts. In addition, the sphere-based puzzles leave quite a lot of consistency to be desired. Any additional difficulties or factors are properly introduced and the player is quickly made familiar with them, making for a smooth playthrough without entirely being stuck on a new mechanic. Q.U.B.E.'s soundtrack acts as the atmospheric centerpiece of the game and perfectly accentuates the dialogue and the plot's setting, taking the player into a harmonic, yet isolated world all by itself. Ranging from smooth ambient soundscapes to rough, but continuous drone-like backgrounds, this game's score not only fuels its amazing atmosphere, but also makes for a great puzzling experience, both inside of the game and outside of it. With the right tracks for the right mood, Q.U.B.E's soundtrack is great for studying, work, or even more puzzling. Overall, I absolutely recommend this game to anyone with even a slight interest in first-person puzzlers, or games that require thinking in general.\n\nMy favorite parts of the game, in no particular order:\nThe note from the protagonist to himself, in order to regain memory\nThe woman's story about her encounter with insanity during isolation\nPuzzling in the dark\n\nThe constant feeling of being torn apart between both versions of the story\nMost, if not all of the soundtrack","November 3, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a simple yet effective art direction that the developers use cleverly: it may not have much variety in terms of the style of the environment of the game, but the layout of each new room and the transitions between them can really make a difference and break the monotony of seeing the same things again and again. The puzzles are okay, although sometimes they can bet a bit repetitive.\n\nBetween puzzle and puzzle we can sometimes listen to the narrative part of the game. There is a story, and I appreciate it being there... but, even though it is interesting, it has a very dull conclusion. I mean, I think it is okay if instead of a decision, there's only one path for the player to take. But then... do not make us believe there is another choice. Without spoiling anything, at the end, you are given two choices, yet if you don't choose what the game wants you to do, nothing happens and the game can’t go on until you do what you're “supposed” to do. What's even the point then! Make it a cinematic or provide another ending , but don’t you ruin it like that!\n\nOn another note, I’d also like to say that the voice actors are really great: AAA quality, seriously, Especially the voice actress. I really appreciate how well she played her role.  The game is, overall, fine, but just take it as what it is, a low-budget Portal/the Talos Principle wanna-be. It didn't quite appeal to me as those other games did, but it's an okay game nonetheless. It definitely deserves its shot if you're into this genre and besides it’s not that long or expensive.","March 2","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It very much has a Portal 1 feel to it in both storytelling and aesthetics.\n\nOn aesthetics: cubes everywhere! Cube walls, cube lifts, cube lights, broken bits of cubes, all the cubes. At one point there is a pillar that is a cylinder, it gives you a new gameplay mechanic which is exciting, but I found myself suddenly confused by the cylindrical column trying to work out if there was more of a hidden meaning behind it as it wasn't a cube.\n\nI found the puzzles were at just the right difficulty, with some just being deeply infuriating rather than hard to solve. But these were few enough to be bearable and actually did increase the satisfaction of completion. The puzzles themselves introduced new elements and variations in each zone keeping things fresh. The puzzles were not done to death, and thinking back I find myself wishing that there were more of a certain type of puzzle rather than being annoyed because it's "another one of these ones"\n\nI actually quite enjoyed the story; it was pretty un-intrusive and nicely tied the puzzles together. And I thought that the ambient music did a really good job of adding suspense and uncertainty. I really couldn't quite decide what the truth really was, which I suspect was the point, and I changed my mind more than one or two times  I would've liked to have had a choice of who to believe at the ending though. And the bit about you writing a letter to yourself was a little strange. There were some pretty long corridors and lift journeys carefully placed so that long monologue could be played whilst not doing puzzles, unfortunately I spent some of that time looking for hidden doors which did leave me to walk them in silence quite a lot.\n\nTechnically, my aging computer handled the game quite well, although the mouse was a little jumpy on the menu & pause screens, and my computer certainly struggled in the final sequences. I also found that the transition from the play and the "cutsceans" was not particularly smooth, and was noticeable. At one point I was all ready to be super smug about finding a broken bit of texturing only to turn around and discover that this was in fact a secrete puzzle and it was supposed to be like that. I'm not sure if I liked that or not, but I happily got frustrated with all the puzzles, so all good.\n\nAll in all great fun puzzle game. I will now be playing the speedruns to try and get all the medals.","October 14, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed both the puzzles and the story.  The voice acting and visual style both impressed me.  Simple but polished.  Not quite on the level of Portal, but if you've played Portal and want more, this will likely suit your taste.\n\nThe controls are a weak point.  I'm going to talk a little about that, and I don't want you to think this means I didn't like the game, because I did.\n\nIn some parts, you have to aim very carefully (there's no auto-targetting help), fairly quickly, and the targetting reticle is often nearly invisible.  The shot cooldown is applied unnecessarily to all situations, including color-change targets which often need to be shot twice (shoot it once, click to shoot again, turn elsewhere, notice that your second shot didn't go through, turn back, find the first target...), so these parts of the game feel can very clunky and frustrating.  Jumping is never very good in a first-person game, and it's an annoyance here as well.  In particular, when you're standing on narrow platforms, and you have to walk toward where you're jumping, it does that FPS thing where walking into the wall at even a slight angle makes you slide along it.  Because of this, and because you can't see your feet, it's easy to accidentally walk off a platform, and also to miss your jump at a precipice.  At times you need to aim nearly straight up or straight down, and due to an overly simple polar coordinate control model the mouse control is very awkward at this; it makes sense, but doesn't feel natural or work well.\n\nThe main story mode is not, by any means, an action game, so there's no real enjoyment in learning to skillfully and precisely control it.  It's a puzzle game, and fiddly controls just cause annoying blunders and waste your time.  The controls are better suited to the timed-run bonus levels, but in today's market full of cheap, good games, I don't think the bonus content is a good use of anyone's time.\n\nThese things could be fixed with, I think, little effort, which makes them all the more grating in a project where so much was done with obvious attention to detail.","January 4","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're an unnamed protagonist who wakes up in a maze of blocky little passages (all alike) without any real explanation of how you got there or why. A voice in your headset tells you that you're doing something of incredible importance to the entire human race—literally incredible actually, as seemingly all you're doing is solving block-moving physics puzzles and it's hard to see any direct correlation between making the green ball go in the green hole and humanity as a whole not dying this week. And the character communicating with you seems a little...unreliable. And then you realize you may not be alone in there...\n\nWhich makes for a really interesting, dark tone that maintained my interest throughout Q.U.B.E.'s 3-hour run time in a way that it might not have otherwise. Solutions are logical but not exactly obvious, so there's a sense of accomplishment as you solve each puzzle and move along to the next, progressively harder one—but there's also a fairly smooth narrative progression as well, at least until the conflicting radio messages reach a fever pitch of urgency just as the puzzles start to require serious thought to work out, which slows things down enough to undercut the immersion a touch.\n\nBut the biggest immersion break comes from the realization that but there's never any opportunity to explore an alternate path or flip the script. You either keep solving puzzles, or you turn off the game. Very meta, but a satisfying conclusion it is not. This all culminates in a final choice which—though the scene in which it occurs is very emotionally charged—you ultimately aren't permitted to make in a way that feels meaningful. The story here really isn't the point so much as the atmosphere of tension created by having to rely on a pair of dueling unreliable narrators, and it doesn't exactly ruin the game that came before it, but a cheap ending is a cheap ending.\n\nStill, the puzzles are good and the game is visually very appealing, with a clean aesthetic and clear objectives that never leave you wondering where you're trying to get to. Late in the game there're some lovely mind-♥♥♥♥y moments to be had as the corridors start undulating and swirling around you like the whole place has come alive, which is pretty sweet. If you've already got Portal and Antichamber and want something else to scratch that itch, Q.U.B.E. is a worthy enough Steam Sale pickup.","January 4","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Adam2/recommended/239430/","Adam2","Adam^2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Adam2/","168 products in account","Religious Propaganda with a Side of Puzzles\nUltimately, the driving force in Q.U.B.E is its narrative, which tries to hold your attention between gaps where thinking is actually involved.\n\nGameplay\nFirst thing's first: The core game is short.  Like under 2 hours short.  No doubt there are some speed runs out there that drastically cut that time even further.  But my first foray through the game was done in under 120 minutes, and that included exploring the environment and planning out how to do the puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are for the most part pretty easy to figure out.  There is a nice gimmick where you do one section in the dark, but those puzzles are actually rather rudimentary, the challenge being that you can't see until you light up each element.  Then there is the game's self described "hardest puzzle" which is really only difficult because it requires precise finagling to get the pieces in the exact right spot needed to complete the puzzle.  That, unfortunately, is a reoccurring theme with many of the puzzles, their solutions may be simple, but getting the timing just right can be a bother when there are moving elements that need to be relocated at precise moments.  While annoying, they aren't particularly difficult unless you have slow reflexes.\n\nStory\nThere is an overarching theme in the narrative between the two supporting characters and the player about faith.  There is also the illusion of having a choice, which can bring about a disappointing conclusion for some players as there is only one ending to the game.  This ending further hammers on the point about having faith.  There is also something of a personal redemption story, though it is weak at best, with regards to the player doing something good after doing something bad, of which the bad is only talked about and never experienced first hand.  There are a few other religious overtones, mainly christian, but don't try to find anything too deep in the narrative, because it's frankly not there.\n\nPresentation\nQ.U.B.E runs on the Unreal Engine, and it's hard to mess that up.  There are very few load times, and they are generally hidden behind room transitions.  The graphics are nice, but with very few art assets, don't expect much in the way of a change in scenery.  The audio is fine, and while there is a soundtrack, it takes backseat and is really only noticeable during story beats or cutscenes.\n\nOverall\nPeople are going to play this for the puzzles, and sadly they're just not there. Nothing is going to make your head scratch, but at the same time there isn't much that is really unfair either.  One glaring issue, is that many of the later puzzles come with an "undo" button, which shows that not enough thought was put into preventing failure states for many of the challenges.\n\nIf you're looking for something to challenge your creative thinking, you're going to have to look elsewhere.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/239430/","October 9, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It very much has a Portal 1 feel to it in both storytelling and aesthetics.\n\nOn aesthetics: cubes everywhere! Cube walls, cube lifts, cube lights, broken bits of cubes, all the cubes. At one point there is a pillar that is a cylinder, it gives you a new gameplay mechanic which is exciting, but I found myself suddenly confused by the cylindrical column trying to work out if there was more of a hidden meaning behind it as it wasn't a cube.\n\nI found the puzzles were at just the right difficulty, with some just being deeply infuriating rather than hard to solve. But these were few enough to be bearable and actually did increase the satisfaction of completion. The puzzles themselves introduced new elements and variations in each zone keeping things fresh. The puzzles were not done to death, and thinking back I find myself wishing that there were more of a certain type of puzzle rather than being annoyed because it's "another one of these ones"\n\nI actually quite enjoyed the story; it was pretty un-intrusive and nicely tied the puzzles together. And I thought that the ambient music did a really good job of adding suspense and uncertainty. I really couldn't quite decide what the truth really was, which I suspect was the point, and I changed my mind more than one or two times  I would've liked to have had a choice of who to believe at the ending though. And the bit about you writing a letter to yourself was a little strange. There were some pretty long corridors and lift journeys carefully placed so that long monologue could be played whilst not doing puzzles, unfortunately I spent some of that time looking for hidden doors which did leave me to walk them in silence quite a lot.\n\nTechnically, my aging computer handled the game quite well, although the mouse was a little jumpy on the menu & pause screens, and my computer certainly struggled in the final sequences. I also found that the transition from the play and the "cutsceans" was not particularly smooth, and was noticeable. At one point I was all ready to be super smug about finding a broken bit of texturing only to turn around and discover that this was in fact a secrete puzzle and it was supposed to be like that. I'm not sure if I liked that or not, but I happily got frustrated with all the puzzles, so all good.\n\nAll in all great fun puzzle game. I will now be playing the speedruns to try and get all the medals.","October 14, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which doesn't mean low quality. The graphics are very simple, but still nice to look at and the game runs perfectly smooth even on older systems with maxed settings and AA/AF. There is a story, but it's just some audio recordings playing in the background that don't really have much to do with the gameplay itself.\n\nThe gameplay is varied, the puzzles are usually fun to solve and the mechanics are usually well thought out. Usually? Yes, because some puzzles are extremely frustrating and no fun at all. That's the biggest problem I have with the game, there are some puzzles in sector 6 that are super annoying to solve. I didn't finish the game because of these puzzles and if you look at the achievements I'm probably not the only one having this problem - only half of the people who made it through sector 5 also made it through 6.\n\nSeems like the game has 7 sectors, so it doesn't seem to be very long (I made it halfway through sector 6 within 2 hours).

Much like Portal, it has simple core concept and builds amazing and very complex puzzles around it. First half of title is accurately describing learning process of this game - quick understanding. Q.U.B.E. shows you new concepts and mechanics one by one allowing you to completely understand how new stuff works before it puts you in complex puzzles. It's hard to describe this game without comparing it to Portal games. It's pretty much perfect first preson puzzle game. Puzzles are a bit harder than in Portal. It's also very climatic. Rooms you are going through are very clean, much more sterile than in Portal. Due to emptiness it has very mysterious, even enigmatic feeling. For some reason it resembles me Antichamber. So after all, basic edition of Q.U.B.E. is solid 8.5/10 in my eyes, perfect FPP puzzle game.\n\nBut this is Direcror's Cut edition. Well, it's 100% worth getting this over basic edition. This one adds entriely new layer of game by adding two characters that contact you through radio. I presonal think that both actors made excellent job, it's difficult to tell what the truth is and who you can trust, yet whith all this lack of trust you still feel calmed when you hear either one of them after some time in loneliness and silence. They both deserver award for this role. Another nice additions made in this edition are secret rooms and trial mode. When you find your first secret room you won't be able to stop looking for more. With Director's Cut Q.U.B.E. gets 9.5/10 from me. Get it as fast as you can.","November 1, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since the player has no choice in the outcome, the story feels overly dramatic and awkwardly staged. Nevertheless these minor annoyances do not detract so much that they ruin the experience.

There's a real sense of mastery to the game design as you gradually learn to manipulate cubes to help you progress through the game. The learning curve feels just right.\n\nIntriguing puzzles combined with a mysterious storyline (backed by excellent voice actors inc. Rupert Evans from The Man in the High Castle!) all keep you motivated to find out what happens next. The controls are simple and intuitive and if you get stuck, just spend a bit of time thinking - you're bound to figure it out eventually.\n\nThis was well worth the price for the experience - I haven't been this satisfied solving puzzles in a long time. I'll likely revisit this game when I get a VR headset.\n\nMy rating: 5/5","January 10","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They’re both first person puzzlers in a white washed testing facility where things aren’t quite what they seem.  Unfortunately, for Q.U.B.E, the comparison isn’t a flattering one.  The art design is less sleek, the puzzles are less engaging, and the story line is less interesting and feels contrived.  For a game released seven years later, it feels like one large step back.","June 5","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
