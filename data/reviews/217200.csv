Worms 2. Though it lacks the insanely tweakable ammo and game settings of the original and doesn't have boobytrapped crates, WA is the best iteration in the series. Especially given that it's playable on modern Windows systems since the 3.16 patch.\n\nForget Reloaded and other new Worms games: this game delivers everything you'ld want in almost perfect style. Thing is: you could get really good at it. It allows a great deal of skill development and at the same time it's a very capable strategy in its own right. Figure out your own style of play: very creative or very effective. Mass damage or darksiding!\n\nALSO a must on any decent LAN so make sure everyone of your friends picks it up at a sale (or have a working install on your pc as the game is portable ;)\n\ngameplay: 10/10\nsounds: 10/10\nfun: 10/10\n\n(PS just picked it up on steam, so time invested doesn't reflect the the real number of hours I spent on it since the 90's)\n\n[EDIT]\nI've read some negatives and wanted to give some heads-up to people that are unfamiliar with Worms games or with the old ones.\n\nThe full price of 15 euro's (or bucks or whatever) is quite a lot if you do not know what to expect. You'll probably better wait for a sale. Also, it's pretty smart to try and check if the game works on your system like it should beforehand. We have LAN's at least twice a year and some pc's have problems with the title, while others have no problem at all. I'm running Win10, my Win7 had no problems as well. I've seen people running 7,8 and 10 with and without problems, but mostly Win8 seems to be the biggest issue (which is to be expected of course :P). But as I said, I've never experienced problems on my systems after patch 3.16.\n\nFurthermore there's quite a lot of contempt over the control scheme and that it isn't rebindable. I understand the issue, but that is indeed how old games often were made. And the game also provides few explanation about the mechanics involved. It's probably best to play with a friend that knows some of the basics, or someone that does want to give some education about it.\n\nI'll consider making a small tut guide and vid if people'd like it and link it here and in the community hub.\n\nHF","October 25, 2014","true","42.9"," 111 of 120 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","111","120","3","0"

If you are looking which Worm game to buy first, make it this one. Do not be fooled by my hours on steam, I've spent countless when I first bought the game back in 1999.\n\nWorms Armageddon has single player elements and multi player elements to it. Traditionally, Worm games are turn based, and there can be two to four teams present on the battlefield. Each turn, a different worm has a chance to unleash mayhem. The playing terrain can be shot away with and you might find one of your worms just sitting above water, short of drowning. What makes this game dynamic is the multitude of weapons given at your disposal. Super sheep's that can fly through the air, controlled by the player. Holy hand grenades that take away a good chunk of the map. Banana bombs that bounce around everywhere and release more banana bombs. On the map as well, there are randomly placed proximity mines and fire barrels that explode and spread fire when provoked.\n\nOne player training missions are available and make for a good challenge and breakaway from single player mode. Teams can be customized from grave choice to voice type, even a flag can be thrown into the mix to represent your team. Custom names can also be given to team worm players.\n\nThis game is a good local game to play with friends, and probably is the only turn based game I'd be willing to play at any time. Absolutely, I would say this game is what made the series.\n\nI would like to see maybe in a future Worms' series a real-time worm game rather than turn based. How would that work? Well if I got paid for further suggestions in my reviews I'd share how :).\n\n\nRATING : 8.0/10\n\n\nGameplay	A	Story / Campaign	A	Visuals / User Interface	B+	Sounds / Music	B+	Replay-ability	A-	Overall 	A","May 24, 2015","true","10.3"," 113 of 128 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","113","128","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrusdrake/recommended/217200/","cyrusdrake","CyrusDrake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrusdrake/","460 products in account","I bought this game on Dreamcast around 1999, not knowing what to expect, which I think allowed me to find hidden gems like Worms Armageddon. I had never played a Worms game before and was on the hunt for any great game in the limited library available on the Dreamcast. Going back to that day, it has been nearly 15 years. It's amazing to think this game still holds up so well. Since then I have played several Worms games, almost all have fallen short of the complexity, difficulty, and variety that WA offered me as a child.\n\nThis is a great game to play in a room with several people, which may be hard to do on the PC version. Most of those days are lost, but when you try to carefully plan out an assassination, walking and jumping through mines, from perfectly landing Ninja Rope insanity, only to end up undershooting a Holy Grenade and blowing your elite worm 300 yards into the water -- the room of viewers will burst into laughter and you won’t care that you probably lost the game. Moments like these are what make the Worms games so great. The newer Worms games offer online and clan wars, but lets be honest... That is a dull experience in comparison. Online can be fun, don't get me wrong, but it is totally competitive and not intended for newer players.\n\nI must also mention in a bit of detail, the Ninja Rope. It has since dramatically changed in all Worms, but in my opinion, not for the better. The classic Ninja Rope took a ludicrous amount of skill and refinement. Not everyone could master it, but those that did, were true bad asses. It is one of the funnest tools in any Worms game, and makes this classic stand out amongst all the sequels. Let me just say, it is a little overpowered. Just like how everyone remembers Quake for "Rocket Jumping," the older Worms games are remembered for Ninja Ropes.\n\nThe single player in this game was pretty tough, and if you have troubles, check out my video tutorials on completing it (on Steam or YouTube). It is pretty fun though, and teaches you several tricks of the trade. I would say to try and complete the training and a few campaign missions before ever playing online. This should give you the basic understanding of how to utilize your weapons/tools. Then see what people do online to become a pro. It takes some time and patience, but is worth it in the end when you start blowing egos into the water.\n\nIn short, if you're looking for a massive array of weapons, level designs, laughter, and difficulty -- look no further. This game is amazing 15 years later, and will be in another 15. Give it a try if you've found the newer Worms games a bit too easy or you've never played Worms at all. There’s no other games like them and there’s a reason Team17 (the creator) has prospered all these years as one of the oldest independent game companies around.\n\nGraphics:        7/10\nSound:            8/10\nGameplay:      10/10\nReplay Value:  9/10\n---------------------\nOverall:           9/10","November 26, 2013","true","66.8"," 59 of 63 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","59","63","0","1"

There are two primary gameplay modes: Campaign and Deathmatch.\n\nThe campaign is comprised of different levels that teach you the gameplay mechanics and give you different goals to reach with a given set of weapons.  It starts out explaining how aiming, power, and wind effect different weapon such as grenades and the bazooka.  You quickly learn how different weapons react to different environments.  The game then puts you in situations where you have to get from point A to point B while only using specific utilities.  There are many levels that will only be completed through trial and error--and that is one of the best parts of the game--it doesn't hold your hand.  You learn how everything works through experimentation.  You learn for example, that a girder can be used for protection as well as to traverse the maps.\n\nDeath Match is a simple 1 on 1 where each player takes turns controlling an individual worm trying to eliminate the other team.  It starts out simple, giving you the obvious advantage in team size and poor ai aiming, while slowing ramping up the difficulty with each match.  By the end, you have a smaller team size and the ai has impeccable aim.  The last match will likely take many tries.  But, when you do win, you will feel like you truly earned it.\n\nAll Worms games follow the same mold, but what makes this one truly stand out is the customization.  You choose the name of every worm on your team as well as their gravestone and voice from a huge list of options.  When you want to face off with a friend or the ai, the game gives an astounding amount of options that are sadly lacking from more recent titles.  You can choose which weapons and utilities you want available (there is a lot to choose from!), how much ammo they have, when they can be used, etc.  You can choose how often health/weapons/utilities drop.  You have control over worm life and sudden death options.  You can essentially change anything you would possibly want.  Don't like the random stages the game gives you?  You can create your own stages as well!\n\nOne of the things that makes Worms Armageddon so great is that you can play multiplayer locally as well as online.  Sure, you can see all of your opponent's crate pickups during local play, but nothing beats being able to see their face when you land that amazing grenade toss to win the game.\n\nAlthough newer titles may look nicer in the graphics department, this game still reigns supreme in terms of content and customizability.  This game was amazing in 1999, and it still holds up today in 2015.","March 5, 2015","true","1.5"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","31","33","2","4"

To this day no other Worms game has been able to reach this level of strategic versatility and creativity. If you want, you can play silly and just relax and have a great time with friends. You can also make it an honorable, chess-like duel of masterful maneuvers and strategies.\n\nCompared to Reloaded and onwards, this game features more sensible physics that can be utilized to carry out pixel-precise maneuvers and strategic plans. Also, the Ninja Rope is as deadly as it's supposed to be, not the gimped and clumsy version featured in later installments.\n\nCompared to Worms World Party, this game is still being updated and has been supporting high screen resolutions and modern operating systems for ages. Also some gameplay-related peculiarities have been fixed (like the difference between fall damage distance and parachute deployment distance), game settings are far more fine-tunable in the game UI, it's minimizable everywhere, maps can be of near arbitrary size, .png format maps are supported in online games, automatic game recordings etc... so yeah, there's a lot to improve in WWP RM.\nThe only thing missing from W:A are some Wormpot modes and I reckon the mission variety is not quite as wide.","November 13, 2014","true","44.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

I am not lying!\nIve played it for about hundret hours in its steam version.\nSome years ago Ive played for even more hours with the retail version. (I have plenty of them, always managed to lose the disc at some point heh) And when I was a kid Ive played Worms World Party when it was released for even even more. With my schoolmates Ive played the demo version on the same map over and over again for I-cant-even-remember-how-many-times. I bet Im scratching on the thousand hours now.\nI dont think I could handle any real professional player online. There were some years of inactivity in between my sessions.\nBut being the best isnt really the point of the game. The point is to play with others and having a great time.\nIts turn based, so its ideal for chilled evenings. When your turn is over you can chat with your enemys in the chat. The most enjoyable moments are these when something funny happens, when a whole dozen of worms are flying through the air or when a tricky shot succeed. Or failed and killed your own team instead the enemy.\nReally, there are so many cool moments in this game you dont have in any other kind of games.\nIf you dont know anyone who plays with you, you can join the online servers. Depending of the daytimes you will find others to play with. If you fear this game will ever stop being popular online: Dont worry. The userbase was never really shrinking since its release. Of course playing with relatives is still way cooler than doing so with strangers.\nAnd a few of the developer are still working on this game. They do fixes, keep it running on up-to-date computers and adding features. Still the game itself stays oldschool. I bet you wont find any game which are still getting that much attention from their devs.\nIf you get the concept of the game and like online matches with up to 5 other people from all over the world, this is your game. I think the single player of Worms World Party is better, but nothing tops the multiplayer of this timeless classic!","November 9, 2014","true","305.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Even though it was originally released in 1999, it has been updated a ton, it seems, and rivals today's games of similar genres.\n\nSomething that is a little hard to deal with, is the fact that there is no tutorial, but mashing keys will help you figure out most of it. The price may be a bit high in some people's minds, but I think this is a very valid game even for 2014. I bought it at full price, but if it's still an issue, wait for it to go on sale.\nBut oh man, watching worms throw rockets and exploding sheep and exploding rocket sheep at each other is really really fun!\n\nOh and, it has online multiplayer too!","May 18, 2014","true","55.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I wake up in the morning grab a coffee and play a game or 2 while I am waking up. This game is a classic. It survives the test of time and is enjoyable today as it was 20 years ago. (previous versions). I changed my HDD and my old copy (on CD-Rom) was lost so I just bought it on steam. I can tell you in WA alone I have over 2000 hours. There is not a single thing I can say is wrong with this game. I play exclussivly SP and the game just never gets old. Safe for kids fun for adults. A few different types of things to do, like deathmatch, you VS AI turn based, you VS friend turn based and missions.  This game gets a 10/10. not because it is a visual masterpeice, it is not. But because it stands the test of time. It is always fun.","November 25, 2015","true","2.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Except online is very more competive now :( Most people will ask u rules of a gametype and most of the time if you dont know you will get kicked I hate pros even though i am one, But that doesnt mean i like playing with them just dont like how they want to play mostly by the rules, make ur own scheme and have fun and make a password and there you go have fun with friends! Any Helpful tips? you can ask me or look up worms armageddon big tutorial on youtube thats the best thing to do if ur beginner at this game. Anyways i reccomend this game have fun wormers!\n\nEDIT 05/29/2015:Actually i take it back this is my favourite worms game of all time it used to be reloaded, but now its this. the amount of custimization is absoultly top and it kicks the ♥♥♥♥ out of the new games's e.g. so u want a game with lots of mines, ok then just go to the game options and set the mines from 8 to 250 :D(and all your eneimes will fly away.....well including yourself lol). if you havent yet played this. PLAY THIS GAME! what are you doing? playing cod? (not saying cod's bad just eh not my fav game of all time lol) nah jk i wont judge anyone that plays cod you play what you want ;) but if you read this review well yea all of the above tells what you need to know lol. I'm certainly not afraid to give this a 10/10 and thats final |:).","August 31, 2014","true","392.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","2"

No wonder. Being the successor to Worms 2, it improved much. Nonetheless, it is still a fun game that you can play with the whole family and friends. Many interesting weapons to choose from, different schemes, colourful maps, speech banks and obviously single-player missions to accomplish should make it enjoyable for everyone.

The actual amount of time I've spent playing this game is incalculable.)\n\nBest game ever made, hands down.\n\nBetter than all of the newer Worms titles. (Although we shall see if W.M.D. ends up being any good.) Unbeatable replay value and deeply strategic gaming. This game literally never gets old.\n\nI've been playing it online since 1999 and I'll be playing it until I die, probably.\n\nLooks are deceiving - what appears to be a simplistic, cartoony game for kids is actually the best online multi-player turn-based strategy game there is. The learning curve is practically endless. No matter how much you've played, you can always improve.\n\nThis is also a fantastic choice for less hardcore Worms players if you merely want to have some 6-player action with your friends and laugh your heads off.\n\nI really don't understand why this game isn't more popular. To this day I have yet to find any game with as much replay value due to how customizable it is, and community-created schemes and maps are abundant.\n\nOne word of warning to newbies: People have been playing this game for a LONG time. If you find yourself losing (and you will), don't be put off by it. Every match is a learning experience and this game takes time to master. Nobody becomes good at this overnight. The community in general is friendly and willing to answer questions.\n\nThis game is digital crack cocaine.

While I still love Worms 2 most of all, mainly due to the stellar soundtrack which they never came close to matching in the dozen sequels, this is definitely Worms 2.5. This is the old reliable workhorse of the series. There's still people online, and they've done a good job making this stay compatible for modern systems and supported well on Steam. What issues they cant fix on Windows 8 and such, they warn you about and suggest workarounds. Nice effort. Not many games from the late 90's are so usable on Steam with no tweaking.\n\nI haven't played much Worms Revolutions and none of Clan Wars, but this still seems to be the Worms title with the most accurate gameplay. Everything is pixel perfect, and the physics can be counted upon to not screw you up unfairly. There's still a lot of charm here, and for people with very weak hardware, this is your game. This series has been milked pretty bad, and you aren't missing much from newer entries besides graphics and shuffling up the equipment. While some can argue the equipment here is unbalanced, that's why you can make your own incredibly detailed rulesets when playing. Create your own balance over time.\n\nAnyway, good memories here, but no nostalgia goggles are worn.","February 17, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Yes indeed it has!\nI have been playing worms revolution, ultimate mayhem, clan wars, and even the lovely early worms-mod for halflife 1(which was one of the best 3D "installments" of this frachies, even though it was created by fans)\nand I must say none of the installments has the same madness, fluidity and "simplicy" as Worms - armageddon.\nAnd I must say I'm not one of those 3D worms haters, but it is hard to not hate or dislike many of the 3D installments for bad grafic engine, bad controllers, lack of the atmosphere and madness and such.\nMy review is also lacking the singleplayer part because I have never played it, I have only been playing this with my friends and I believe that is also what this game is best for :)\n\n\nOkay lets take the cons first, shall we :)\n- Needs a DLC or patch with more weaponary (okay one thing first, armageddon do have the best selection of weaponry and a customization and so on compared to the others) but when you have played armageddon a lot and have played some of the later installments with some of their few new crazy weapons, you do miss some of those from the newer installments.\n- Sometimes the bots can be rather stupid, normally they are quite average, nothing really to complain about, but a few times I have experienced some stupid bahaviors from their part XD\n- Thats it, I can't really come up with anything else. Sorry!\n\nAnd here it the PROS! :)\n- The simplicity! No simplicity does not mean it is boring and plain, not at all. From my perspective the best games has always been the simple one, not those who tries with lots of special effects or twisting plots(With plotholes) to hide their lackness, but those games who are simply being what they are, nothing more, nothing less. Worms armageddon is for everyone, from little children to grown ups, it is easy to start with, but hard to master. And even if you have mastered the game, luck still has to smile upon you in a battle with your friends. :P\n- Fluidity. Both the grafic and the playthrough are indeed very fluident, so smooth compared to others and especially clan wars which still lags even with a really great gamercomputer 'cause of a stupid grafic engine.\n- ZEE CUSTOMIZATION! In a multiplayer game you can custom anything from your teams, to the map, the game modes, time, drops of crates, starting health, weaponry, the ammo(infinite bananas! XD) and strenght of the weapons. So much to do which can really change the gameplay totally. I just love it! all the opportunities, but which is presented in a simple way so even a totally newbie would be able to understand.\n- Mulitiplayer gameplay, fair play. Okay without any doubt it really does help if you have played this game many times before. But still when it comes down to it, luck is a big part of it. I cannot count how many times I have been beaten by newbies because of this. It makes it fun for everyone and challenging in a non frustrating way.\n- The styleart. Even though it is vey simple and cartoonish, I think that is what makes this game so charming, it is so pretty in its simple cartoonish styleart.\n- It works with every computer(I don't know about mac and linux)! I have been playing this on windows millennium, windows XP, windows 7, windows 8 and windows 10. Maybe I'm lucky but I have had no problems at all both with the CD version and steam version.\n- Bananas? Infinites Bananas? Bananas with max blast strength? The only weapon, which you have, is bananas? now that is indeed fun!! Blast your friends with a high chance of killing lots of your own worms :P\n\n\nWorms armageddon is meant to be a simple game filled with fun and madness in a way which are enjoyable for nearly all ages. :) And in my opinion this game does not only beat all other installments in this franchies, it is one of the kind. :) No wonder why so many people have falling in love with the franchies ^^ because even though it is purely violence, it is violence in this fun and silly cartoonish way that you cannot complain about it :)\nAged well, just as a good wine ^^","December 22, 2015","true","9.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It built on the original game, and tweaked the flaws in Worms 2, but the reason this is still the best after 15 years are the patches that have been released over the last few years.\n\nTeam 17 have allowed 2 coders (Deadcode & Cybershadow) to keep updating the game. Adding user requested features and tweaks that have just perfected the game. The games resolution can now be set far higher than when originally released, making the game look sharp on modern PCs. Map sizes have virtually no limit, allowing for the game to evolve in so many ways it;s creators could not have envisiged. (Checkout my maps on http://www.wmdb.org/users/ohms )\n\nTo Team 17's credit the game is still playable online via their servers, and it's never been so much fun.

Reloaded and other can handle 4 worms each team with a total of 16 worms on the field, but with W:A you can have up to eight worms on each team with 6 team slots making 48 worms on the field.

It built on the original game, and tweaked the flaws in Worms 2, but the reason this is still the best after 15 years are the patches that have been released over the last few years.\n\nTeam 17 have allowed 2 coders (Deadcode & Cybershadow) to keep updating the game. Adding user requested features and tweaks that have just perfected the game. The games resolution can now be set far higher than when originally released, making the game look sharp on modern PCs. Map sizes have virtually no limit, allowing for the game to evolve in so many ways it;s creators could not have envisiged. (Checkout my maps on http://www.wmdb.org/users/ohms )\n\nTo Team 17's credit the game is still playable online via their servers, and it's never been so much fun. I wonder how Team 17 will ever create a worms game that will lure us WA players away from it.

This game, Age of Empires II, and Starcraft I were the only games I played for months. I challenged many friends, tested out multiple strategies, perfected my aim, and created multiple schemes and maps. This game will always hold a special place in my gaming experiences.\n\nAnyways, the gameplay of this Worms game is probably the best in the series. I'm not just saying that due to nostalgia. After playing Worms 3D, Worms 2 Armageddon, Worms Reloaded, Worms 4 Mayhem, Worms Revolution, Worms Open Warfare, and so on, those all feel inferior to the classic gameplay shown in Worms Armageddon. Bazooka in particular has always felt just write on the 2D landscape in this game. But things like traversing the landscape, setting up traps, and strategizing combos worked well within this gameplay style.\n\nCharacter customization is as charming as ever. The worms voices and sounds are still fantatically presented. The graphics are also better than what I remember from the 15 year old game.\n\nOverall, this is one game I'll always cherish and looking forward to more zany battles with these dastardly invertebrates.","January 15, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And I played it with my friend for hours and hours and hours. This game was (and I dare say still is) very addictive and fun. A variety of cool weapons and gadgets to get rid of the opposing worms (or to surrender...coward). This was improved in Worms World Party, which is unfortunately missing here on Steam. But Armageddon is the next best thing! The newer Worms games are okay too but somehow even though they have more variety it is still Armageddon that grabs my heart. Online co-op is clunky and problematic but that can be expected from a game this old (although a fix would be nice). It still takes from the rating I give this game. My personal view on this game is that it is best played with someone right at your side so you can see the stupid look on their face when you have a chance for a double-kill on their worms...and they can see yours when you mess up and kill your worms instead. It is a cool game worth recommending so go and grab it!","December 25, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And I played it with my friend for hours and hours and hours. This game was (and I dare say still is) very addictive and fun. A variety of cool weapons and gadgets to get rid of the opposing worms (or to surrender...coward). This was improved in Worms World Party, which is unfortunately missing here on Steam. But Armageddon is the next best thing! The newer Worms games are okay too but somehow even though they have more variety it is still Armageddon that grabs my heart. Online co-op is clunky and problematic but that can be expected from a game this old (although a fix would be nice). It still takes from the rating I give this game. My personal view on this game is that it is best played with someone right at your side so you can see the stupid look on their face when you have a chance for a double-kill on their worms...and they can see yours when you mess up and kill your worms instead.

It was so awesome. I got it again, to try it. This game is from 1999 , but hasn't aged at all. Worms Armageddon is still a really enjoyable game! I really love it, it's so awesome. Even though it's from 1999, it features 720p! So HD is there too! The graphics are as i said, pretty good concidering they're from 1999, it's pretty much like an other worms game in graphical terms. The only thing I would like to see, is a mod or update where you can actually rebind the controls, unfortunately, with the game in this state still, you can't. Anyway, if you love the actual Worms series, this a game that you don't wanna miss out on!","August 14, 2015","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I mean... Worms 2 was already good, but Worms Armageddon is where they reached perfection. Games that came after that were unable really to add to it. None of them was anything new. And the attempt to move the gameplay to 3D killed most of the fun. Seeing they put this in the store finally, I have to tell you... This is the most epic thing you can get! Mastering it isn''t easy, but MIssions and Trainings will teach you many tricks. And if you gather friends for a hot seat game, actually playing together on one PC, it is most likely the best thing for a house party: it will give everybody a lot of fun and laughing! I know it did in my case. I'm not kidding you, I personally rate this game 10/10.","March 19, 2013","true","8.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Everyone has their nostalgia glasses donned when they talk about how this is the best game in my opinion, because if you didn't have this in your childhood and are picking it up for the first time, it hasn't aged well and gives you a pretty large learning curve and you'll need to look up a lot of stuff online.  And I wouldn't recommend playing online with random players, becuase in my experience they were ninja experts swinging around using their ropes and annihalated me immediately.\n\nOverall, if you're new to Worms, I would tell you to skip this title and opt for Worms: Revolution or newer, because you'll have an actual introduction to the game and its mechanics as well as a better interface, visuals, and controls.","January 15","false","2.2"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","5","18","0","1"

You take turns angling and firing all kinds of different weapons in deathmatches, but I didn't remember all of the controls.\n\nThe options menu has no way to change, or view the controls, nor does the basic training. The basic training is just a series of missions where it tells you to do something, but doesn't give you ANY inkling of how. I haven't played this game in over a decade, I don't remember how to open up the weapons menu. But if you don't figure it out in time, you fail the basic training mission, and have to go back not to the start of the mission, but three missions back. I can't even fathom what absolute moronic "game designer" thought that was a good idea. If you do two missions, and fail the third because of an unfair time limit, zero explaination of the controls, and zero guidance on how to use them.\n\nSeriously, I'm dropped into a BASIC TRAINING mission, where I need to reach a crate, and two targets on platforms slightly above me. It explains that I can use an uppercut to reach them. But if you use said uppercut, it's not nearly high enough to reach, and you've used up your single punch you get for that mission and fail. Now you need to complete the two previous missions to get back to this point and figure out what you did wrong. How am I supposed to figure out that not only do you need to jump, but you need to DOUBLETAP backspace (Which isn't even the jump key), and then hit space to double backflip, and then at the peak of your jump, use the uppercut? On top of that, the training missions are MANDATORY in order to play the real missions, and I STILL don't know how to open the weapons menu.\n\nSo I'm sitting here, having only played for less than thirty minutes, and I'm frantically searching the internet on how I do absolute basic, and mandatory things like jumping, and opening the weapons menu.\n\nIt's tragic, I have so many fond memories of this game, but back in the day, my friend introduced it to me and told me all the controls. Trying to learn the basic controls of this game is the biggest "F-You" I've EVER seen in gaming in my entire life.\n\nBuy this game for the nostalgia, but new players, stay the HELL away.","December 21, 2015","false","1.9"," 6 of 26 people (23%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","23","6","26","2","6"

Secondly once you get the game working the controls are pretty retro and can't be rebinded. I'm running at 2560x1440 and the game displays fine at that resolution however, the aiming seems to be off slightly and I can only assume that its down to higher modern resolutions. The menus are all really low resolution which is something I don't care for but I guess thats a personal preference. There is also content missing, I was wanting to use the scottish voices but they are not in the steam version along with about 5 others. So you need to download them all and place them in the appropriate directory. Back in 2012 There were promises being made that the game would be updated for modern OS's and key rebinding would be implemented, it's now March 2015 and they haven't lifted a finger so I think it's fair to say they have forgotten about it :(\n\nWorms Amageddon was a good game in its day, but the developers just seem to be doing a cash grab putting it on steam in it's original untouched version without optimising or updating it.","March 31, 2015","false","0.5"," 14 of 50 people (28%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","28","14","50","3","5"

I remember taking the CD of this game over to friends' houses, where we'd team up against the computer in the most outlandish scenarios we could think of.  Yes, we'd sometimes kill half our own team with an extremely poorly-planned super banana bomb, but we didn't care.  In this game, the hilarity of mistakes outclassed even the feeling of finally throwing that perfect grenade. It was stupid, perfect fun no matter what happened.\n\nDon't just get Armageddon for the nostalgia value, though.  Get it because it's still as great as it was in 1999.  Get because it's still being patched and has a big community behind it even today. Get it because there hasn't been a greater Worms game since.","March 20, 2013","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArkylieKillingstad/recommended/217200/","ArkylieKillingstad","kilyle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArkylieKillingstad/","130 products in account","I'm thrilled with this game, have enjoyed it for many hours, and encourage you to give it a try.  But let's start with three annoyances I've noted:\n\n1. LAN matches can't include computer opponents, which reduces versatility -- only PvP vs. your friends, no co-op vs. AI (my nephews prefer PvP in all games, but I prefer co-op -- and the other day when my nephew actually wanted a co-op match, I realized we couldn't do it).  I assume you can create allied teams of players but that means we'd need at least two more computers.\n2. Teams are stored per-computer instead of per-Windows login -- I have to put up with my nephew's teams as part of my list (which irritates the OCD part of my brain), and at any time he could accidentally screw up or delete my teams.\n3. Once a team is set to Human or AI, you can't change that.  If I want to sometimes play characters from Night Vale and sometimes fight them, I have to make two separate teams for that alone.\n\nOther than that, I'm thrilled with this game.  Bought two copies for my nephews so they'd have something they could play against each other that wasn't zombie-themed or Minecraft, and I think I've had more fun with it than they have (though both find it quite fun).\n\nEach team is composed of 8 worms with a personalized flag, gravestone, anthem (to play when you win), and accent.  The accents range from real-world languages to a variety of English-language accents to a variety of comedic accents (including the Three Stooges), a cyberspeech voice bank, and a drill sergeant (which I cheerfully used for my Buzz Lightyear team... it was kinda funny to hear Booster and XR shouting orders in drill sergeant form).\n\nYou can set up a variety of teams and play up to eight (I think) in one match.  You get to choose how many worms from each team get in the game, which teams are allied, and which teams have a positive or negative handicap (+/- 25% health).  I found it amusing to set up a full match while I was crocheting, and watch my male friends and female friends (two separate teams) battle my favorite internet reviewers, Alice Cooper leading a group of mix-and-match Halloween creatures (Zombie Santa, Ghost Werewolf and the like), Herobrine leading Minecraft Let's Play-ers, and the gang from Saints Row, while I occasionally got a turn with my team of characters I'd played over the years in tabletop role-playing games.  All with hilarious accents.  I haven't tried it yet but I'm pretty sure you could set up an all-AI game if you wanted to enjoy watching (or just listening to and occasionally glancing at) a match while doing something else.\n\nSo yeah, good game, well recommended.  I find the graphics (especially the playing fields) quite amusing, and Sudden Death Mode has saved my hide more than once as I tend to place my characters on high ground, so all I have to do is wait it out while the baddies slowly drown (and hope they don't have any teleporters left).","April 25, 2015","true","24.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is just as much fun now as it was back then. It's simple, chaotic, cathartic fun, but with surprising depth when you go below the surface. The worm customization system is nicely in-depth, and while it lacks the more exotic options available in more recent games, such as optional hats and worm skin colours, it makes up for it with team size options of up to 8 worms on a team in combat, although this goes down when you have three or more players simply due to the size of the levels themselves.\n\nAlso, protip: If you want to stay friends with someone, NEVER play against them on a bridge level. Particularly if said bridges have water under them. There is no quicker way to destroy a friendship.","July 23, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have a bunch of cute little worms, with cute little physics-based weapons (well, sometimes they're not so little), trying to destroy each other. It's brilliant because it's ridiculously fun for both casual and hardcore gamers. The hardcore gamers get their kicks from practising their technique until they become unstoppably accurate with all their shots, whereas the causal gamers simply enjoy the trial-and-error fun of shooting bazookas at each other.\n\nThat's the entire Worms franchise. All the Worms games are more or less like this: quality games that are more or less interchangeable. That being said, I would have to say that Worms Armageddon is the best Worms game so far. It has a wide variety of weaponry, a huge capacity for customisation (although you need to beat the game to get the full options), very accessible level editor, interesting missions, training that is actually fun, as well as a "deathmatch" mode that is fun, intense, and has never since been replicated.\n\nAlthough these are petty concerns, where WA falls short is in two respects: a slight lack of help in how to play the game, and in its online community. I found that, when I first played WA (when it came out), it was difficult to figure out all the little controls. There are two jump buttons, and pressing or double pressing produces different jumps, which was confusing at first. Also, customising grenades, such as changing the fuse time or making them bouncy, was never clearly explained. If you buy this game, consult the following page:\n\nhttp://wormsarmageddon.team17.com/main.html?page=abou&area=cont\n\nMost of the necessary controls you can pick up in the game, but the page is a useful reference when you really want to nail down your grenade shots or your ninja roping.\n\nThe other problem, as I mentioned, was the online community. When last I checked, WA had an entrenched and hostile online community, where the standard was absurdly high, and anyone not of this standard was abused and/or dropped from games. But, so long as you play with friends, this shouldn't be a problem.","March 24, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was obvious that it had been designed with the arcade or mobile audience in mind, who don't desire a lot of customization. It was basically a PSP port ("Open Warfare 2" from 2007) with just a few tweaks, and it did show!\n\nCutting to the chase, "Worms Revolution" turned out to be a disappointment on almost all levels, BUT the best thing about pre-ordering it was the free copy of 1999 classic "Worms Armageddon"! In contrast to the watered-down "Revolution" "Armageddon" lets you customize almost every single aspect of the game – From weapon power, crate contents and choosing random or timed mines to the number of landscape objects or the probability level of first aid kit drops: Every player was able to tailor his very own game modes and this led to a huge variety of amusing play styles, which could also be experienced in the game's online multiplayer mode.\nSpeaking of online, Armageddon's online community is still very strong after all these years. I've been playing this game 200+ (!) hours within the last few months and there was never any shortage of online opponents.\n\nI can understand Team17 were trying a reboot with "Revolution", attempting to appeal to younger players. It's not a bad game on its own merits. But if you do know "Armageddon" or "World Party" it's just inevitable to scratch your head over some of the design choices they've made on "Revolution". It's just incomprehensible that "Armageddon", a game from 14 years ago, feels superior and is in fact more feature-packed than the latest offering.\n\nSo, if you want a classic and complete Worms experience, I suggest skipping every franchise title made past 2001 altogether and get "Worms Armageddon" or "Worms World Party". Both are equally good, but to my knowledge "Armageddon" has the stronger online community.\n"Armageddon" is currently not available to purchase via Steam. I hope this will change in the near future. It really deserves to expand its audience.","February 28, 2013","true","959.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The singleplayer is pathetic, the graphics are bad, the lag in local area networks is annoying... the only fun that this game gives you, is what you do with your friends with it, but in that regard, it's a 1000 times better party game then anything Nintendo ever made... and i usually love Nintendo stuff...\n\nImagine a turn based game like smash, where everyone got 4 - 6 Nintendo guys, and then you blow each other up with bombs and stuff... (I wish)\nThat's really a genre that could profit from those 20 year old mechanics. While in smash, you just mash buttons and everything is over in no time, without anyone knowing who even killed whom, in Worms, everyone gets to watch every piece of the action. If someone did a realy sneaky move, to do something to you or your other opponent, then you will know it, you will see it, and you will get mad or laugh your ♥♥♥ off about it.\nAfter the fight, you take a minute to start a new game, and in that minute, your friends and you can actually talk about what happened... people plan revenge... people plot things... Unlike in Smash like games, where after the fight, nobody know who killed whom, and you just start the next game, with again, everyone just mashing buttons, like last rounds...\n\nIf you are able to play this game locally, or with a voice setup with friends, it's one of the best game that you can quickly bring up and play for a few minutes or hours. Without the social aspect of... you know... trust and betrayal etc... there won't be much fun in this game for you.","July 25, 2015","true","40.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When the series returned to its roots with Reloaded there as hope, but it just wasn't that great... the ones after it haven't improved.\nWorms Armageddon is still the pinacle of the series and still has an awesome and strong going community supporting the game.

In this game, the hilarity of mistakes outclassed even the feeling of finally throwing that perfect grenade.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/recommended/217200/","slycooperfan1","SlyCooperFan1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/","307 products in account","I distinctly remember playing (and loving) a game on Nickelodeon's website a long time ago called "This Means War", which was an artillery game based off of the show Catscratch. It was the only artillery game I had ever played for a long time, so I had no idea that there was a whole genre of it. A friend of mine introduced me to Worms Armageddon, and I have to say, I love it.\n\nThe best part about Worms is the worms; they have cute animations, they react in hilarious ways to everything, and they feel like their own characters (especially once you put names to them). The gameplay is also fairly solid; there's no randomness, it's all down to strategy and skill. The multiplayer is relatively active for such an old game, but it's definitely best played with friends.\n\nUnfortunately, the game does show its age. The UI can be clunky, and the menu resolution (not the in-game resolution, which is fine) stays very low no matter what. If further patches could be made to revamp the UI, or at least remaster it for higher resolutions, it would be spectacular.\n\nWorms Armageddon is a classic in the Worms series as well as the artillery genre in general. For anyone looking for a hilarious time, I definitely recommend it.","June 23, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Being re-united with what is arguably the best Worms game in the series is a fantastic feeling for a nostalgia junkie like me. But aside from nostalgia, the game itself has never failed to impress me.\n\nThe turn based gameplay means that every battle is unpredictable. Even if you're a veteran to the series, it's impossible to determine what might happen next. The sense of unknown with each battle keeps me coming back. The AI isn't the best in the world, but that's arguably a good thing, because it means they are prone to mistakes. And when they do make mistakes, the outcome is often hilarious. It compliments the witty charm of the game.\n\nI love games that you can make your own and Worms Armagdedon is no exception. There are tons of ways to customize your team. The best part is undoubtably the wide range of voices you can apply. My personal favourites for general banter are the 'Danish Pyrus' and the 'Soul Man' voices, but there are countless others which you a bound to find at least mildly amusing.\n\nWhy is Armageddon the best in the series? It gets it right off the bat. The interface is fluent, the visual style is the most memorable. The sounds are on point and the overall gameplay is smooth and straight forward. Plus, I've always believed that the selection of weapons in Armageddon has been better than the rest.\n\nIf you're thinking of getting into the Worms franchise, I highly recommend getting this one first. As far as I'm concerned, its the most comprehensive of all Worms games. It's funny, its well paced and its very addictive. Plus, people like me who have potatoes for operating systems need not worry about hardware upgrades or any of that nonsense. Just install it and play to your hearts content.\n\nAbove all, this game has not aged in the slightest since its 1999 release, and that's extremely rare. This game is nothing short of a masterpiece. It gets a 10/10 from me. It is one of THE very best games I have ever played.","October 26, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls might be a bit weird in the beginning (considering I had to learn back the basics but thank god for a tutorial that is in the game in the form of ''basic training'') but after that it felt all nostalgic to me. Furthermore it has also something what i didn't had back then which was online multiplayer. It is definately fun tho local multiplayer is also fun as hell (because you can annoy your little brother by ''accidentally'' pressing the spacebar when he has a Bazooka on his hands). Another Fun feature this game has takes a little bit of time in searching in your local data but there is a map in the folders named Bank Editor. This is software which allows you to put vocals in it as a voicebank for your Worms.\n\nIn short:\n\n- Relatively easy to play (or otherwhise some tutorials which are good)\n- Iconic weapons as a Banana Bomb and Holy Hand Grenade\n- Good old random fun"\n- (Online) Multiplayer\n-editable voicebanks so costumazation is possible\n- old nostalgic feeling\n- wide array of weaponary","December 23, 2013","true","39.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Over the years I played this I kept finding new tech learning how to fully utilize the physics to do crazy things. Using the rope to make absurd swings to basically impossible locations, aiming Bazooka shots to curve with the wind or setting custom timers on grenades to perfect your throws. However despite all these tricks, the game can become very challenging. There were several campain missions I that took me weeks or even months to complete but I eventually beat all the campain. The weapon selection is amazing although there are a few I could never understand what their use actually was. The multiplayer is where this game really shines, I loved making weird maps with really stupid layouts and starting games with nothing but extremely powerful weapons in extremely cramped stages.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game enough. I've played a couple of the newer games but none of them felt the same. Worms Armageddon can be summed up in one word, one that has been ingrained into the heads of Worms fans everywhere...\n\n"HALLELUJAH!"\n*BOOM*\n/Connection to host has been lost...","August 27, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was the only artillery game I had ever played for a long time, so I had no idea that there was a whole genre of it. A friend of mine introduced me to Worms Armageddon, and I have to say, I love it.\n\nThe best part about Worms is the worms; they have cute animations, they react in hilarious ways to everything, and they feel like their own characters (especially once you put names to them). The gameplay is also fairly solid; there's no randomness, it's all down to strategy and skill. The multiplayer is relatively active for such an old game, but it's definitely best played with friends.\n\nUnfortunately, the game does show its age. The UI can be clunky, and the menu resolution (not the in-game resolution, which is fine) stays very low no matter what. If further patches could be made to revamp the UI, or at least remaster it for higher resolutions, it would be spectacular.\n\nWorms Armageddon is a classic in the Worms series as well as the artillery genre in general. For anyone looking for a hilarious time, I definitely recommend it.","June 23, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Over a dozen years later it has not even aged that badly - infact some argue the game is more playable than ever.

Mentioning those, every single worms game worth a ♥♥♥♥ing quid that has come after this game has tried, but mostly not succeeded at recreating the magic that makes this game so great.

Being re-united with what is arguably the best Worms game in the series is a fantastic feeling for a nostalgia junkie like me. But aside from nostalgia, the game itself has never failed to impress me.\n\nThe turn based gameplay means that every battle is unpredictable. Even if you're a veteran to the series, it's impossible to determine what might happen next. The sense of unknown with each battle keeps me coming back. The AI isn't the best in the world, but that's arguably a good thing, because it means they are prone to mistakes. And when they do make mistakes, the outcome is often hilarious. It compliments the witty charm of the game.\n\nI love games that you can make your own and Worms Armagdedon is no exception. There are tons of ways to customize your team. The best part is undoubtably the wide range of voices you can apply. My personal favourites for general banter are the 'Danish Pyrus' and the 'Soul Man' voices, but there are countless others which you a bound to find at least mildly amusing.\n\nWhy is Armageddon the best in the series? It gets it right off the bat. The interface is fluent, the visual style is the most memorable. The sounds are on point and the overall gameplay is smooth and straight forward. Plus, I've always believed that the selection of weapons in Armageddon has been better than the rest.\n\nIf you're thinking of getting into the Worms franchise, I highly recommend getting this one first. As far as I'm concerned, its the most comprehensive of all Worms games. It's funny, its well paced and its very addictive. Plus, people like me who have potatoes for operating systems need not worry about hardware upgrades or any of that nonsense. Just install it and play to your hearts content.\n\nAbove all, this game has not aged in the slightest since its 1999 release, and that's extremely rare. This game is nothing short of a masterpiece. It gets a 10/10 from me. It is one of THE very best games I have ever played.","October 26, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is one of the best worms games i have ever played back then and i think it still is so far..or atleast the best 2D Worms game made. The controls might be a bit weird in the beginning (considering I had to learn back the basics but thank god for a tutorial that is in the game in the form of ''basic training'') but after that it felt all nostalgic to me. Furthermore it has also something what i didn't had back then which was online multiplayer. It is definately fun tho local multiplayer is also fun as hell (because you can annoy your little brother by ''accidentally'' pressing the spacebar when he has a Bazooka on his hands). Another Fun feature this game has takes a little bit of time in searching in your local data but there is a map in the folders named Bank Editor. This is software which allows you to put vocals in it as a voicebank for your Worms.\n\nIn short:\n\n- Relatively easy to play (or otherwhise some tutorials which are good)\n- Iconic weapons as a Banana Bomb and Holy Hand Grenade\n- Good old random fun"\n- (Online) Multiplayer\n-editable voicebanks so costumazation is possible\n- old nostalgic feeling\n- wide array of weaponary","December 23, 2013","true","39.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Being re-united with what is arguably the best Worms game in the series is a fantastic feeling for a nostalgia junkie like me. But aside from nostalgia, the game itself has never failed to impress me.\n\nThe turn based gameplay means that every battle is unpredictable. Even if you're a veteran to the series, it's impossible to determine what might happen next. The sense of unknown with each battle keeps me coming back. The AI isn't the best in the world, but that's arguably a good thing, because it means they are prone to mistakes. And when they do make mistakes, the outcome is often hilarious. It compliments the witty charm of the game.\n\nI love games that you can make your own and Worms Armagdedon is no exception. There are tons of ways to customize your team. The best part is undoubtably the wide range of voices you can apply. My personal favourites for general banter are the 'Danish Pyrus' and the 'Soul Man' voices, but there are countless others which you a bound to find at least mildly amusing.\n\nWhy is Armageddon the best in the series? It gets it right off the bat. The interface is fluent, the visual style is the most memorable. The sounds are on point and the overall gameplay is smooth and straight forward. Plus, I've always believed that the selection of weapons in Armageddon has been better than the rest.\n\nIf you're thinking of getting into the Worms franchise, I highly recommend getting this one first. As far as I'm concerned, its the most comprehensive of all Worms games. It's funny, its well paced and its very addictive. Plus, people like me who have potatoes for operating systems need not worry about hardware upgrades or any of that nonsense. Just install it and play to your hearts content.\n\nAbove all, this game has not aged in the slightest since its 1999 release, and that's extremely rare. This game is nothing short of a masterpiece. It gets a 10/10 from me. It is one of THE very best games I have ever played.","October 26, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The 3D rendered 2D gameplay offered by the newer iterations is very pretty, and water weapons, physics objects, worm classes, and so much more do make for great games, however they all still fail to capture exactly this game. It's hard to articulate exactly how perfect and balanced this is. Maybe it's the range of weapons that includes your typical bazookas and grenades alongside magic bullets and sheep strikes. Maybe it's the way it feels so much more responsive over all other iterations allowing for perfectly timed ninja rope swings. Hell maybe it's just nostalgia. One thing I can say though is that even after 15+ years, this game is THE Worms game that we all love and play. It's THE gold standard of Worms games that has yet to be matched. This game has a brilliant art style, ample options for customisation and map creation, is nicely patched to run on modern systems with a myriad of lovely little tweaks to keep it going, and is still one of the best local co-op games I have ever played.

The worms games are a lot of fun all around. They come with good humor, fun gameplay, and enough interesting levels to keep you interested for some time. I've played a few of the games in the series and I have to say, this one feels the most well rounded. Admittedly they've made some cool new advances in subsequent games, but this one just feels right. The weapons, levels, and dialogue all come through very well in this one.\n\nI haven't really talked about what type of game this is. Well, you get a team of worms and you blow up another team of worms, funny dialogue and cool weapons ensue. I'm sure most people already know what the worms games are all about anyway. I'd recommend any of them, but this one is at the top of the list.","January 20","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Team17 should have stopped while they were ahead and gave the fans what they wanted most. The genre is stretched paper thin now with a plethora of terrible games, most feeling like an Armageddon clone. WWP was a nice addition, but it might as well have been an expansion pack.\n\nWorms Armageddon is timeless and has infinite replayability. Optional variations such as level design and customizable rulesets enable this game to compete with new releases.

The singleplayer is pathetic, the graphics are bad, the lag in local area networks is annoying... the only fun that this game gives you, is what you do with your friends with it, but in that regard, it's a 1000 times better party game then anything Nintendo ever made... and i usually love Nintendo stuff...\n\nImagine a turn based game like smash, where everyone got 4 - 6 Nintendo guys, and then you blow each other up with bombs and stuff... (I wish)\nThat's really a genre that could profit from those 20 year old mechanics. While in smash, you just mash buttons and everything is over in no time, without anyone knowing who even killed whom, in Worms, everyone gets to watch every piece of the action. If someone did a realy sneaky move, to do something to you or your other opponent, then you will know it, you will see it, and you will get mad or laugh your ♥♥♥ off about it.\nAfter the fight, you take a minute to start a new game, and in that minute, your friends and you can actually talk about what happened... people plan revenge... people plot things... Unlike in Smash like games, where after the fight, nobody know who killed whom, and you just start the next game, with again, everyone just mashing buttons, like last rounds...\n\nIf you are able to play this game locally, or with a voice setup with friends, it's one of the best game that you can quickly bring up and play for a few minutes or hours. Without the social aspect of... you know... trust and betrayal etc... there won't be much fun in this game for you.","July 25, 2015","true","40.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
