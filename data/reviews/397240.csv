It starts off as a Rayman clone but after awhile it starts to get interesting and throws in creative new gameplay elements. Some stages are so unexpected in their imagination. The game has some unpolished elements and a few bugs and glitches. But it hasn't crashed and nothing has broken the game. I'll admin that I could never finish a Rayman game because they're just too difficult for me. Troubles Land might be too easy because I'm getting 3-star stage completions. It doesn't require collecting every jewel. It's a lighter challenge, but I think that's okay. I've completed 3 of the 5 worlds at the time of this review and I think I already got my $10 worth. At this point I'm excited and pleased with the game. The developers didn't "phone it in".","September 12, 2015","true","3.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

If so, pick up this great ol' psychadelic rabbit sim! Play as limbman as he goes on a great quest to reach all his friends houses. Each friend is a racist in his own way, and uses his racism to kill that race. (I.E. Sparta hates elves, Fish hates everyone) A++ ;U\n\n","May 1","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
