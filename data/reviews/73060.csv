"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/73060/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","Set in the world made famous by Majesty, in Ardania, you are the king. Some arrogant noble causes trouble by sending militia to attack you, so you slash back by building towers to defend your castle and sending various troops to counter-attack. Campaign takes you through Ardania to find the culprit of the attacks on your cities. Sounds cool enough, but unfortunately, you probably shouldn't get too excited.\n\nDefenders of Ardania is a mix between Tower Defense (TD) and Reverse TD. You can protect yourself by building towers, but ultimately, you win by destroying the enemy castle(s) by sending out troops. Troops are quite strong: a single tower can hardly destroy a wave of enemies, so you either need to build more towers in clever spots or, which is usually easier against AI, destroy the enemy castle quickly.\n\nThere are about 5 different types of units and towers, none too different from other games of the genre. Some units can attack other units (rather weakly) and others can attack enemy towers. There's some strategy involved in placing the towers, as you are limited in the number of towers depending on the level. You may also direct your troops using a waypoint (yep, a single one) or place bounties (akin to Majesty but costs nothing) to focus fire on certain enemy. What is interesting is that your troops gain experience: using certain type of troops makes them stronger.\n\nLater on, this feels indifferent though: it was always easiest just to either (following is a couple of killer strategies for campaign) zerg-rush the enemy with cheap or fast troops or use a reverse scorched earth tactic building a couple of waves of turret-destroying magicians followed by bomb carts that insta-kill castles. This worked in almost every map: While AI can build towers to counter your troops, it's not up to these kinds of attacks.\n\nAlso, while there are three races, you can only play humans in the campaign, the rest restricted for AI and multiplayer (which I've yet to try: servers are empty though). Every race has its own towers, troops and spells, which is cool, but with mere single campaign, the game feels unfinished: there really should be a campaign for each race.\n\nStory is quirky and and full of nerdy jokes, puns and references, so at least it does not take itself too seriously. You do have to endure some quite bad voice acting along the way (I'm looking at you, Kilia the Elf!). Playing it through lasts about 5-10 hours, probably less if you can come up with winning strategies faster. I guess it might be worth it for the amusing ending. :P\n\nWhile not entirely bad, there are many better TDs out there: this one fails to fill its niche in the reverse TD. So if you just kind of like TD genre, stay away. If TD is your hot chocolate, by all means do get this one but do yourself a favour and do so when it's on sale or bundled.","May 6, 2014","false","10.1"," 66 of 68 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","66","68","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/73060/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Defenders of Ardania (DA) can be summarized as a tower defense / offense game set in the universe of Majesty game series. As such, it can get a bit frantic, esp. when you add in spells and possibly multiple factions.\n\nYou defend your castle with towers, with the restriction that you are limited to 10/15/20 towers TOTAL, and each tower must be within 4 "squares" of at least one other tower (your first tower must be within 4 squares of your castle), subject to restrictions on the playing field (such as you must leave at least one path and so on). Some squares like mine, hill, and power, provides bonuses like extra income, better visibility, and more attack power. Some maps may provide additional bonus tricks.\n\nYou attack your enemies by building units, from common guardsman (swarm) and rogue (very fast but weak), to much tougher but slower units like swordsman, mages, and priests. Later you also get flying units and super-tank units. They emerge from your castle and attack enemy castle. If there are more than one, you can choose which one to attack. If they make it into the enemy castle, appropriate amount of life is deducted from that castle. The objective is, of course, reduce the other castle(s) to zero, which also destroys all his units and towers.\n\nThe resources you use, gold, is generated automatically, and you can spend them on towers, units, or buy some improvements for the economy like make all units 20% cheaper, make all towers 20% cheaper, and so on. Finally, there are some "spells" which lets you heal your castle (a little) or a spell such as a huge lightning bolt that strikes down an enemy tower.\n\nThe main problem with this game is the interface. You'd think the logical way to build those units (and there aren't that many of them) would be to leave some onscreen buttons, but no. The only controls are a pop-up "remote" where you click on one of four buttons (or cancel), which takes you to upgrades (for economy), units, spells, and attack target.\n\nTowers are your typical shooter, artillery, slow, and later, energy. flame, sniper, and so on. There's a twist in that some advanced units CAN attack towers, and if one was knocked down, nearby units will change to shortest route if the tower's destruction opens up a new path.\n\nGraphics are quite decent and has no problem going all the way up to 1680x1050 on my dual monitor setup. Sound is nothing special.\n\nThe campaign is a series of "missions" where the new King of Ardania must gather his closest allies and sail forth and solve the mystery of the rising tide of undead. There are also limited resource mode and survival mode if you need more of a challenge.\n\nAll in all, DA is a bit of also-ran in the RTS / Tower offense-defense game. As I found Tower Wars to be better, DA with its bad UI issues just doesn't have much going for it other than the name and a bit of shared universe. While the game does offer some unique challenges, the overall effect is a bit of "meh". It's playable, and it BARELY makes me want to recommend it... just barely.\n\nUPDATE: Got to next to last mission, and all of a sudden the game dead-ended for me. You are up against THREE enemies, and once you destroy ONE enemy fort, that fort spawns a superchampion that will ANNIHILATE your fort... unless you can destroy it in time. The problem is you don't have enough room, and the only tower that seem to damage it is the ray (sniper) tower. According to the walkthrus I read, the only way to solve this is setup a stupid exploit... You setup two ray towers in his path, then you build and unbuild towers IN his path to force it back and forth, back and forth, past the two towers until it dies. WTF?!\n\nThat's just stupid.","April 6, 2015","true","8.8"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","21","24","2","0"

Although Majesty 2 was fairly dissapointing, it wasn't totally terrible, and tower defense is a pretty easy genre to to reasonably well.  I am not super-far through this yet, but so far it has been nothing but dissapointing, with boring non-interactive gameplay, sluggish lack of strategic decisions that matter, and even terrible voice acting (the advisor guy from Majesty 2 is all right, but some of the others are really cringe-worthy).\n\nDo not try this at home.","May 21, 2014","false","1.0"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","0"

Although set in the same universe as the majesty games you probably won't notice as the majority of the lore, units and locations is of much the same generic fantasy staple as 99% of the rest out there.\n\nDefenders of Ardania takes on the genre in a way we mostly see from PvP focused Tower Defense games by letting you not only manage the defense of your own keep through Tower placement and ability use but instead of making victory based on the simple passage of time you have to send units yourself towards the enemy keep and past his towers to secure victory. This a great mechanic for multi-player but unfortunately it hamstrings the AI in the single-player campaign quite badly as it simply does not build fast enough or responds fast enough making most of the maps a breeze to win by simply rushing fast units with little concern for your own defenses.\n\nA rather weird income system that never lets you run out of money for more than a few seconds at a time and hard limits on both towers and units only compounds this problem, making the first 5 minutes of any map the only minutes that really matter and any game that progresses beyond that because a rather dull slugfest where you sit around with an impenetrable defense, spamming the same units over and over waiting for their experience to go up enough so that you can unlock a more powerful hero version.\n\nDefenders of Ardania is not a very inspired game, the gameplay mechanics do not lend themselves to single-player very well and although some entertainment can be found in the game's multi-player component the lack of anyone actually playing it online means this is only viable if you do it with friends. There are many better Tower Defense games out there, Sol Survivor even has a multi-player mode with pretty much the same mechanics as this, only not quite as broken.","May 11, 2013","false","35.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KermodeBear/recommended/73060/","KermodeBear","KermodeBear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KermodeBear/","478 products in account","The tower defense genre is well known and well understood, with many good games to serve as examples on how to get it right. With all of the good material available for study it's hard to understand how Defenders of Ardania managed to fail so hard. You'd think that, at the very least, the company would have been able to manage a mediocre game but Defenders of Ardania fails in nearly every aspect.\n\nAlthough this game does require you to attack as well as defend, that isn't enough extra to save it from everything else. The voice acting is a crime against humanity; the tower selection isn't imaginative; the campaign is terribly easy - just spam cheap units as soon as the game starts and away you go. There's a lack of strategy and fun.\n\nMultiplayer isn't much different. It also plays rather poorly on slower connections, despite the minimal amount of data that a tower defense game needs to pass back and forth. What is it doing to choke my friend's pipe? I don't know, but it's unnecessary.\n\nI'd advise against a purchase even if it is deeply discounted and you're a tower defense fan.","October 5, 2014","false","19.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

The execution was lacking, though. In-game the mouse becomes very hard to control, accelerating and decelerating much slower than I would like while playing.\nThe game also lacks strategic depth that was very simple to include. The game includes several different types of units to send out to attack the enemy. Most of these units end up being roughly equivalent though. Tanks vs runners is effectively a choice as to how long you want to wait as they usually end up reaching the end at roughly the same success rate. Swarmers are useless since each swarmer costs the same amount of your unit cap as others. Yes, they bunch up more from the beginning, but other units have this property as well. Any unit that attacks things will also end up bunching up because the units will wait for their attack.This means that swarmers, while cheaper, and a nice place to start have no use later in a match. Having these set roles for what stage of a game to use swarmers or tanks or runners or whatever else causes the game to follow a very set path.\nThe towers are also very similar. Yes, you have the AoE towers vs the single target towers. Within the single target towers, there are supposed to be towers that are good against soldier types and towers that are good against tank types. In the end, the anti-tank towers also serve as the best option for anti-soldier, leading to a very boring set up being optimal.\n\nGreat concept, terribly executed. I would suggest finding other tower defense games to play.","November 7, 2014","false","18.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VasVadum/recommended/73060/","VasVadum","𝓥𝒂𝒔","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VasVadum/","260 products in account","Ok, I see a lot of bad reviews about the game and wanted to clarify some things some people have said, as well as provide my own views.  This review may contain spoilers, so don't hover over spoiler areas if you don't want the game to be spoiled.  I hope the devs are reading this, because this game could be great if they'd just make a few changes.\n\nFirst thing I want to say, some people claim that there is terrible voice acting.  I hear nothing wrong with the voices you twit!  Stop coming up with things to whine about.\n\nAs for someone saying "The game runs like ♥♥♥♥"?  Maybe you should check your machine specs because it runs 60FPS or better at 1080p on my machine, no issues whatsoever, everything's smooth and fast.  The controls are a little odd though but it doesn't "run like ♥♥♥♥".\n\nI think the game has too few levels in it to be worth $10.  Maybe if multiplayer and skirmish had some different maps, but this game does not.  It limits you on the amount of towers you are allowed to place even so it isn't worth replaying the same old maps over and over again.  The best you can do is place 20 towers, and that's in the final mission.  Also in the final mission, tower placement seems to be bugged because I can't place them in some places if it might block where the enemy castle MIGHT appear even if I've blocked his ability to go to those places.  What the game SHOULD do in this case, is have the enemy walk through the tower with the shortest path to your base, until you unblock the path, if his castle should teleport to one of those places that you already towered up.\n\nIf the game devs had released some DLC with new maps, that might have been nice.  But this doesn't appear to be happening, and the DLC is too costly to be worth it for what they give you. $3 for a new tower, spell, and unit for each race? Really?  Come on.  We don't even play as any other race because replaying the game sucks and as far as I saw, I couldn't even change my race.  $2 for 1 new spell for all races, and 1 new spell for each race?  That's just plain greedy.  From what I read, the spells aren't even that great.\n\nReally though, it's a tower defense game.  It can't be that hard making a new map every once in a while for it.  Hell, to make the game really worth it, you could release a map editor/creator, and add workshop support, and let players add their own maps in.  This would be well worth the time then because I'd be playing this game all the time with custom maps and the such like that.  Right now, Defense Grid is so much more better because of the large large volume of maps you get.\n\nSpoiler related to two missions:\nIn the last two missions, you find out that you need to use an exploit of removing a tower and placing one to change the entire wave path forcing the end game bosses to go back and forth infinitely just so you have time to kill them.\n\nIn the last mission, you can't even kill him with spells.  He has 1000 HP according to the info.  I hit him with lightning 8 times, and he didn't die, and I lost to the onslaught of enemies.  So the third time I played, I rushed him, placed towers at the entrance once I stopped the castle from moving, high level mirror towers (not their name but it's how they work, just can't quite recall the name off the top of my head :P), then hit him with lightning and kept placing new mirror towers all around him trying to change up the path as much as I could to keep the enemies and him at bay.  It eventually successfully worked, even though he destroys all towers in one hit, or two hits and your repair can't stop him so repairing a tower he hit is useless because he'll attack it again very soon.\n\nThe game lacks a pause feature from what I am seeing.  Sure, you can hit the escape button, but it isn't an in game pause, so that you can look at the map, and find a suitible pathing setup for your towers and plan ahead.  It would also be nice to be able to build towers while the starting game talking is being done, maybe even with gold income disabled during that time just so you can have the towers built and ready, not that it is that big of a deal though.\n\nEnemy AI needs to be able to destroy their own towers in order to rebuild or move them.  I've noticed that the only way an enemy can build new towers is if you lightning them.  And this is an advantage because I noticed he had no anti-air in one level so I sent nothing but air units because he couldn't rebuild towers.  The enemy also isn't very good at planning ahead.  If you start sending lots of air units, he still only keeps one air tower, nor does he do much upgrading.  he's more focused on sending units.  There should be a harder AI here that is better at predicting your attacks and able to hit you harder.  The last two maps, weren't even as difficult as some of the others.  The only thing difficult about them was their nearly invulnerable bosses.  Otherwise, they'd have been easy.\n\nI like the Majesty lore, I played Majesty Gold way back when it first came out even and still have the disk and the HD version on steam.  They did well enough on the lore of this game to make it worth it, it would be nice if they would add more maps.  That's really the only thing I can see right now making it worth the $10 it is currently costing.  I think it's current worth would be more closer to $7.50, and the DLC would be $0.10 per added spell, $0.15 per added unit, $0.20 per added tower.  Global spells count as one spell.  This is just my opinion.  If they were to make DLC to add new maps, I think it would be grand, much more worth it and a map editor?  Hell yea that'd be way more worth it.  Especially with workshop integration for ease of DLing and sharing maps.\n\nNew game modes could be fun too but alas, I'm not sure this game will change.  If you see it on 50% sale, or better, then you might like it.  It is beatable without cheating, I consider it an exploit to delete a tower and place one elsewhere to change the path but it is kind of part of the tower defense genre in some games so I guess it isn't that bad using this method if you want.  :P  It just doesn't offer you anything other than campaign maps.  Skirmish re-uses these maps, and so does multiplayer.\n\nShould you get this game full price? No.\nWill I re-review if anything changes, or the game is updated, or such? Yes.","November 14, 2015","false","13.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

This one is a little different than any I have ever played before.  The thing about DOA that makes it unique is the goal is to destroy your opponents castle so you have to raise multiple types of troops etc.   There are 3 diferent races you can play as each with there own tower types etc.  I have had a great time playing this game and will have plenty more time to get better and get all the achievements.   Its replayability is high, graphics are good, sound effects are good, story is meh, but the gameplay is fun.  It does get repetative at times and some levels are extremely easy because some of the units are over powered.   For instance: Bomb carts do 300 damage to the base, manage to squeeze 2 of them past there defenses or rush them early and you win.\n\nI rate Defenders of Ardania 7.5 out of 10.   Try to get this one while its on sale!","June 11, 2012","true","13.8"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

(the only map you could not swarm the enemy base). The only good beside the last map is the story or lore and when i say good i mean i like the silly monthy phyton style it has to it but some of the jokes are dull and others are just bad.\n\nWhat more i like in the actual game is the tower defense, all the maps are diffrent and some have elemental hassard trying to ruin your day but for the most part you can just swarm rush them and end the map quickly. When it comes to send units there are a few classes Swarm, Runners, Tank, Soldier, Caster (i call them that), flying units, and Heroes. the only thing you need to focus on mostly is swarmers and runners, Tanks are slow and flying are to expensive to mass, some units can heal themself other can attack other units on the lane they are running and caster can attack towers but are still nothing more than anoying. The Heroes are endgame units wich u get unlockt when your units hit max level (4) and can easely walk through most mazes without a problem... but games tend to end before you can unlock them.\n\nWhen it comes to towers the only complaint i have is that its realy hard to tell them appart and most time i build anti air when i need ground targeting towers witch is anoying but the tower system is well balanced and all have a specific use and sync very well with other towers.\n\nThe Gui of the game is clearly layout for an use of a console and i recomend to use the keyboard over the mouse as the mouse is to slow sometimes.\n\nI usaly dont like TD's att all (and to bad my list is 50% TD's give or take) but i like the twist in this game where u can direct somewhat what path your troops should go and  the enviroment hazard. when it comes down to it i didnt enjoy alot of the early stages and the only challange was the second last map in the campaing.\nBut i will still give it a 6.5/10 for having lore from the ardania world and the TD twist they have.","April 15, 2013","true","7.4"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeanDKnight/recommended/73060/","SeanDKnight","Sean D Knight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeanDKnight/","682 products in account","When I first heard this game’s title I immediately thought of Majesty 2, a medieval sim game that takes place in the land of Ardania. Though Defenders of Ardania is related to the Majesty franchise it surprisingly shirks its predecessor’s medieval sim genes and instead fits firmly in the tower defense genre.\n\nTower defense games have been around for quite a while and every year there are tons of them released as indie titles and mods. I was curious as to how developer Paradox Interactive would tackle this particular sub-genre of real-time strategy.\n\nLike many such games, Defenders of Ardania has you slugging it out with an AI or human opponent to try to wipe out each other’s base. You set up towers to defend your building against enemy troops while simultaneously sending out your own armies to destroy the opposition.\n\nFollowing in the vein of Majesty 2, Defenders of Ardania is filled with bright colors and has a nice style to it. But sadly the graphics aren’t that polished and the game seems to use the same engine as Majesty 2.\n\nIn addition to borrowing graphics, Defenders’ music also uses the same themes as that of its strategy-game counterpart, which was filled with sweeping orchestral pieces. The voice acting, however, is rather horrendous. Aside from your stalwart Advisor the characters, such as Kilia the Elf, will grate on your nerves. The character sounds like an old woman who talks rather slowly. In fact, if I couldn’t skip the dialogue at the beginning of each campaign I probably would have stopped playing.\n\nRead the rest of my review at Press2Reset: http://press2reset.com/reviews/review-defenders-of-ardania/","November 26, 2013","true","6.3"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","8","22","0","0"

Unskippable, extended dialogue at the beggining and end of chapters. Unexplained, but crucial, game mechanics.
