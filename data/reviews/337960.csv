"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ch3aph3at/recommended/337960/","ch3aph3at","CheapHeat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ch3aph3at/","1514 products in account","I've had ClusterPuck for a few months and have played about 20 hours of it before it's launch on Steam. All of those hours in multi-player - so I cannot speak about the newly added 1 player challenge mode added for Steam launch.\n\nClusterPuck is a really great local multiplayer game - it's a load of fun to play, and it is even fun to say. The more friends and controllers you can get, the better. We play with 4 controllers - so usually 2 v 2, or we play the 4 of us vs 4 cpu opponents. We have an absolute blast, I can only imagine how much fun this game is with 8 controllers and 4 v 4 action!\n\nIt looks a lots like a simple top down air hockey table where each player controls a puck and each team tries to score goals using the only ball. There are no fouls and no referee, meaning you can barge, block and push your opponents. There are spikes, bouncing obstacles and speed ups, all adding extra craziness to the action. Table layouts which first seem impossible get a lot easier with a bit of practice - but the table with just 2 goals and no obstacles is probably still our most played table. I would recommend a big screen or a projector for playing ClusterPuck too, as there is a lot going on when there are 8 players, and the screen zooms out to take in all the action.\n\nIf you have the controllers and the friends, then ClusterPuck is one KICK ♥♥♥ game. It's joined MarioKart and Towerfall as one of the ever-presents when we meet up to play games. Highly recommended is you're in to local multi-player gaming.","January 25, 2015","true","8.8"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

The controls are crazy simple (2 buttons and a joystick) so that anyone can learn to play quickly, but advanced players can find and develop strategies that add a lot of complexity to the game.\n\nMy group of friends and I have gotten really competitive as a result of Clusterpuck, and I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up becoming an eSport as it is perfectly balanced and involves a lot of skill and strategy.\n\nIf I had one complaint, it would be that connecting 8 controllers to a laptop is a bit of a hassle. If you buy this, be sure to pick up a USB hub or a wireless adapter for Xbox 360 controllers.","January 29, 2015","true","1.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

To be honest, by that point I'd already fired up the game to see what it was about. The menus are so well designed and easy to navigate, they look gorgeous too. I am a graphic design student who likes minimalist design heaps and i have to say, i would have paid the full price just to stare at the menus, they are that aestetically pleasing.\n\nReading about  the game i found out it had a single player, from what i could find, this was a challenge mode.. I gave this a go and found it rather fun, however i just wanted to play a game.. I decided to search the forums seeing wether the regular matches had bots to which i found out they did. I couldnt work out how to get bots into the game. My only criticism is when you first start out it isnt immediately obvious how to start a game when choosing teams, i think this is just me being dumb but ohhhh welll xD When i workied it out, it makes perfect sense.\n\nFrom browsing the achievements i saw there was one for a 10 minute long game.. That is the longest time limit you can have on a game, I decided- why not!! :D There are a lot of maps, from traditional hockey/football(soccer) style maps to totally ridiculous deathtraps and mazes. All are very fun to play. You can have up to 9 bots if you are playing solo and you can even pit yourself 1v9 (nothanks).\n\nWhen i worked out how to navigate the next menu, it got me to choose a map and then assign bots before i could start. It really is idiot proof (except from me.. I'm just dumb). This game was well worth the price and to make that even better, it was on launch sale!! As of yet i haven't met any bugs either, which is strange as the game is only 2 days old.. Most definitely reccomend this!! Congratulations to the devs for coming up with such a fun and replayable time waster. It truely is beautiful and it handles a treat!!","January 26, 2015","true","1.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","2"

It is a great party game, and if you have eight controllers, than everyone can play and yell and holler at each other in one of the best non-sport sport games I've ever played! When starting out with new players, play on the "Competitive" Maps as there are no traps on these maps and this allows everyone to get a feel for the game. Move onto the more intense maps if you really want to create a proper cluster of swears and jeers.\n\nThe challenges are a nice distraction and do help get a better understanding of the feel of the game.\n","January 25, 2015","true","5.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

You can create a profile (or multiple ones if you have family/friends who'd like to play) and choose a unique symbol/icon with which to identify yourself.  After that, any live players (up to 8 locally) will choose their color/side and then agree upon a map.  Some maps are easy & plain while others feature obstacles that'll push you off the playing field or just kill you altogether (you'll respawn after a short period of time). This is a pretty fun game for $10 and while the AI is competent, folks will enjoy themselves much more if they can find family/friends to play with.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VydVspm6f8Y","January 24, 2015","true","0.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I LOVE this game. I'v owned this game for a while now, and I've logged at least 10+ hours on it before it make the jump to steam. The game itself is a fun arcade style sports multiplayer game that wouldnt feel too out of place on the N64, If you have at least two friends that you could consistently play it with, it's might be worth a buy. Its not as much fun solo, and the lack of online multiplayer causes me to seriously hesitate recommending the game in its current state. but they have added in a challenge mode which makes it slightly more exciting on your own, but it took me an hour or two to complete and the replay value is not very high for this perticular mode. Worth a buy? If you have 2+ freinds who love exciting couch multiplayer sports games that will have you yelling and screaming over epic defeats and comebacks, then yes. If you are primarily an online player, or do not enjoy local co-op, then no.","January 23, 2015","true","3.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

Me and my nephews had a great time. Ai is pretty good. If you need to add one or 2. You can setup how ever many you want up to 10 players in all. you can even co-op vs a team of a.i.  A.i. has 3 different settings. easy, medium, and hard. Not really a good 1v1 game since once a player gets past the other one all they have to do is drive the puck into the others goal with nothing in their way to stop them. It is still playable with 2 humans just have to add some bots, or enjoy the battle leading up to getting the puck past the other player. There are several maps with some features such as spikes,speed boosters, and bouncers that will affect your player if you hit them, these maps may make it more playable in a 1v1 environment. Overall I definitely recommend this game if you have 4 players or more and It's not bad with odd amounts because you can add bots. Don't read  too much into the 1v1 complaint I made, just making sure if you buy it you intend to play with a few extra players. It does have a single player challenge/ camapaign also.\n\nAs of 2016.. no release of talked about update on forum.. also with windows 10  and xbox one controllers do not function correctly. Seems to be a unity issue also.. cuase I ahve several games that all use unity and have same issue player turns to left even when not inputting any input. It can be fixed by devs...

My friends and I went out to buy Cards Against Humanity, but ended up coming home with a Steam giftcard to but Crawl with. We had another $10 leftover, so we looked up "great steam multiplayer games", or something along those lines—and came across this game. We watched the first trailer (not the live-action one) and it peaked our interest. Then we watched the live-action trailer. We were hooked. We experienced some issues downloading it because Steam was experiencing "heavy load" at the time, seeing as it was Memorial Day. It was well worth the wait. ClusterPuck '99 is one of the best games I have played in my life. I would be willing to give PHL Collective the funds to make as much DLC or ClusterPuck '00 if they wanted (if I had the money, but I'd be willing to work for it). These devs are awesome and so is their game. I can't recommend this enough. Just make sure you have enough controllers, because everyone's gonna wanna play.","June 1, 2015","true","18.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

At first glance it looks like air hockey, but it really isn't at all like that apart from the main point being to get the puck into the goal. But as you control your "character" (if you can call a red or blue circle a "character") you'll slip and slide around obstacles toward the goal. The spikes are deadly, the yellow bouncy things are annoying as hell, and your opponents can bash into you and knock the puck away from you at any time, which all combined make this game insanely hard and super fun. It's awesome to push opponents into the spikes and rush to victory, and super frustrating to push opponents into the spikes only to discover that you misjudged the distance and pushed yourself into the spikes too :P\n\nVisually, this game reminds me of Heavy Bullets, with the same minimalistic and vibrant atmosphere. The controls for keyboard and mouse are some of the worst controls I've ever seen. Seriously, it uses "ESC" as the B button, and either enter or space as A (I never could figure out which, since it's different in the menu than in the actual game). But plug in an XBox 360 controller, and the controls are great. The fact that you slide around like an air hockey puck on a low-friction surface means you have to be much more precise than you might think, and shooting can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ because your opponents don't actually have to do anything to block your shot, they just automatically catch it if they happen to be in the line of fire.\n\nClusterpuck is aptly named, it's one giant clusterpuck of insanity, but very enjoyable insanity nonetheless. And since it's on sale for only a dollar right now, there's no reason not to try it out! It's probably not for everyone, especially people who ragequit easily, but if you enjoy difficult games then this will be right up your alley.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention, this is mainly a local multiplayer game. There is no online multiplayer, which is really inexplicable since it's a game made for playing with other people. But if you're like me and don't have friends, you can add bots to your match to play on your team and the opponent team.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

It boasts the rare ability to have 8 players play at once (if you have the controllers and USB ports to pull it off, mind you), and what it lacks in graphics, a sluggish pace, and the glaring error of no online multiplayer it tries to makes up for with its simple and engaging concept and gameplay. This simple game (with its ~4 controls) regularly creates the memorable moments that most people look for in local multiplayer games. You know, the ones where people are laughing, yelling, or high-fiving because of momentary displays of skill, chaos, or brilliance.\n\nIn my time with the game I have found that the AI, even on "hard" difficulty, are very little challenge and it is often best to give them an extra man or two to keep things stressful in the most delightful way. Friendly A.I. rarely, if ever, pass the puck which is frustrating but the developers explained that having a "call for the puck" button would radically change the game and its feel and I agree with them. However, it does make playing this game alone vastly inferior to playing with a buddy. A hell of a lot of fun can be had when you're outnumbered by A.I. and have to work together to overcome their quantity with the quality of your play.\n\nIt is frustratingly easy to over and/or under-pursue the puck and if you've played the EA Sports NHL titles, there is almost no element of the puck "magnetizing" to you if you are in proximity to it, you must make contact with the puck to possess it. This takes some getting used to, but it is by no means a deal breaker in regards to the feel of the game.\nFor the most part I play on the "competitive" levels because I find that there is more than enough chaos without boost squares, bumpers, and spiky death balls, but the game does feature a nice variety of levels. The zanier levels are good fun if you want to escape the feel of air hockey and sate your hunger to murder opponents by checking them into spiky death balls (it never gets old). The fact that there is a level editor supposedly on the way makes this one of those little-known games that sincerely deserves your attention.\n\nWith all of that being said, I would not have paid $10 for the game because of the lack of online multiplayer and how much there is left to be desired in regards to some of the controls, game speed, and the AI. However, when the next update rolls around and adds the level editor, more levels, and some other layers to this game it will easily be worth $10 if you regularly play with other people. If this one goes on sale again and if you're a local multiplayer aficionado, give it a look and tell your friends to bring their controllers, you're going to need them.\n","July 19, 2015","true","17.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls are relatively easy to figure out, they could probably use a quick help box or something before rounds, but they aren't hard to remember.\n\nI'd definitely recommend playing this with actual people, though. I tried a round with just a ton of bots and the ball would get stuck in the corners pretty often.","June 20, 2015","true","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The genre has expanded out far and wide, and many games that would have been praised before are now plagued by obscurity and fighting amongst their talented competition. ClusterPuck 99 had been out for some time on Desura before hitting Steam at the beginning of 2015, one of five games bearing the genre’s tag released in the month of January. Steam in 2015 can be a vicious marketplace, which is why I was pleased to see ClusterPuck come out on Xbox One earlier this month. I had found the game on Desura ages ago, was eager to see what improvements had been made in the meantime, and what console specific fun I could have with the title. For better or worse, I found that ClusterPuck 99 has stuck to its roots as an insane multiplayer arena that requires swift aim and a roomful of friends.\n\nNOTE: This review was written primarily using the Xbox One version of the game.\n\nWant to know more?

This was looking to be so fun, I don't know what X is on the keyboard, I can't even join the game! unfortunately, this game is ment for controllers and since I don't have one, there is no point in owning the game. This game is basically for singleplayer or with your friend. A BIG DOWNSIDE to this is there is no multiplayer WHICH SHOCS ME because the developer states it's okay without a multiplayer.

You only use the left analog stick and two face buttons, to pass and shoot the puck. When a game is this easy to play, it opens the door to non-gamers, who will love Clusterpuck. I consider this to be exclusively a local multiplayer game, as that is where it truly shines.\n\nAmazingly, Clusterpuck supports up to 8 players. I tried this out with friends and it was an absolute blast, and we have played with 8 players several times since then. Note that if you want to do this you will not only need 8 controllers but you will also need two Xbox 360 wireless dongles to facilitate the 8 controllers. The setup is a hassle but it if you go through the setup and have 8 friends to play with on a large screen, I think you will agree that it's worth it. We played this on a 120" projected display.","November 9, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
