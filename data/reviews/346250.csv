Such is the case with The Old Tree, a minimal and simplistic point and click adventure that takes less than a minute to download, less than twenty minutes to complete, and leaves a lasting impression.\n\nThe gameplay has you clicking on interactive objects while the camera follows a small squid like alien through several unsettling and atmospheric scenes. You could say this is more interactive art than actual gameplay – it is a little creepy, and the game’s experimental nature is clear from its opening.\n\nYet this doesn’t detract from the experience. The art is clearly the major draw for this game – and the minimal design aesthetic works well in its favour. There are several small puzzles that work on a light versus darkness factor, and this is usually very easily discovered. There really is no frustration. It feels familiar and yet different.\n\nThe sound is also minimal and simplistic, with an unnerving background drone-like soundtrack. It repeats often, but I think this also is to The Old Tree’s benefit. I’m not sure what it’s trying to accomplish, but I feel urged on to completion and at the same time just slightly rattled.\n\nWhile there really isn’t anything to say for the game’s replayability or even for the game’s controls – The Old Tree is an easy recommend. Being available for free helps – but I feel it’s important to recommend games that are just a little different than the norm. And in that – The Old Tree really works.\n\n7.0/10.","July 17, 2015","true","0.2"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","36","38","0","2"

So lets get this show on the road.\n\nI'm not really sure what the game is about. You play as this little squid who hatches from an egg and makes his way up on top of a tree.\n\nThe game is a point and click game, but you don't move the character. The character moves on his own and you just clear the path so he can continue this journey.\n\nThe art style is incredible. It's this games best feature. It's fun to just to look around at the environment.\n\nThe game is also incredibly short clocking in at around 15 minutes long, so when you finish it don't expect a second playthrough.\n\nOverall this game is a fun short experience. If you're looking for something while you're bored give this game a shot.\n\nFinal Rating:\n7/10 - Play It\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","December 13, 2015","true","0.2"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","33","36","0","1"

I'd say it had an impact of at least a fifteen minute game, maybe even more.\n\nI know the descriptions say its an alien, but I couldn't help but think it looked like an apple, and that it would probably fall pretty close to the tree, because, you know, proverbs.  No, I don't mean like in the bible, I mean in the colloquial homespun wisdom passed down by old people on rocking chairs.  Ever wonder just why these wise old folks are almost always found in rocking chairs?  I do.  I wonder if maybe they're not all that wise after all, if maybe for some reason we are all just programmed to accept anything said by someone in a rocking chair as being wise.  Now that I think about it, my grandmother would sit in her rocker and by golly it seemed like all she could do was spout pearls of wisdom, but I'll tell you this much.  As soon as she got up from that chair, bam, we put her ♥♥♥ in a home.  Just kidding about the home, the truth is we had her put down.  Such is the way of our people.\n\nSo, yeah. it's well worth the time to play The Old Tree, it is a pretty game, little bit like something Amanita would do, also reminds me of The Plan.  I give it something out of something else.

The artwork is very subtle and understated not overpowering any scene and creating the right mood to allow the game to shine with it's relaxed slow pace.\n\nIf a nice relaxing 10 to 15 minutes of gaming is what you are looking for, then look no further that The Old Tree.","May 11, 2015","true","0.0"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

You play as, well, probably some sort of small alien baby that wants to go places. Help it by observing the environment, clicking on things, removing obstacles and allowing it to move forward.\n\nWithout any explicit story, and with very basic puzzles in the vein of Samorost and Machinarium, there isn't really much that is particularly new or exciting here. None of the puzzles are particularly difficult if you are observative - but there's still a well made guide you can consult if you get stuck. Even so, this 15 minute experience is well designed and evocative, with beautiful art and a nice soundtrack - and if nothing else, it made me curious enough about Tales of Cosmos to download and play its demo. (Something less than an hour worth of puzzle and exploring in space, with some interesting ideas - worth trying out!)\n\nIf you have 10 spare minutes, you really have nothing to lose and may gain a few free smiles.

It's brilliantly brief. You can play it here, or on the developer's website, and in this and other ways, it's kind of Samorost-y. It should take you 15 minutes or so to finish, though I put in more time than that because I tried playing it at work and ended up having to quit and start over later from home.\n\nBasically, you play as the watcher who makes safe passage for a little hatchling who looks like a cross between an apple and a squidlet. You'll left-click a couple of times on likely spots, and when the coast is clear it will creep along to the next puzzle. There's atmospheric music, seamless execution, and an upbeat finish to this trifle.

The puzzles are secondary to them. I help them complete the puzzles so they can keep the story moving. They love to verbalize their own stories to match the action. It's thrilling for me to listen to their imaginative accounts of what they think is going on in the story.  I have Steam accounts for the three familes and Steam is the perfect vehicle for me to add the games I think they will like and are in the problem-solving, imaginative genre.\nI would have paid $10 for The Old Tree, for all three families, so they could have another quality game in their Steam accounts. When I visit the families, instead of a bedtime story, the kids want to huddle together around games like The Old Tree. And so do I. I highly recommend The Old Tree and thank the developers for making it available at no cost but I do think they should charge something for the game.","January 28, 2015","true","1.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

As a newly born alien, instinctively walk the strange world that surround you towards an uncertain destination, solving puzzles to continue forward.\n\nPros: The eerie and the unknown meet with beautifully handdrawn-like graphics and atmospheric music. You have absolutely no idea what you're trying to accomplish, just that you must go on, bypass the obstacles that block you, and proceed. The puzzles are simple, but they are only obvious once you've figured them out. The world feels utterly alien to you, as it would to a new born baby alien. There is no fighting, to violence, no dialog and no age barriers to this game, just the feeling of discovery.\n\nCons: The game is very, very short, 15 minutes tops. There is no mistake you could make, nothing that would require you to restart, and no progression or branching path that would entitle a form of replay value. Most puzzles involves an extremely obviously click, maybe two.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nThis game was made with heart, with care. It's quick, it's free, there is no reason why anyone wouldn't give it a try, if only to see it for themselves. You may think you just wasted 15 minutes, or you may spend the next hour or so pondering its meaning and the undefined mood it left you in. All I can recommend is to just...see for yourself!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","February 4, 2015","true","0.5"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

This game is a fairly simple point and click puzzle game which doesn't appear to have any reason to be other than to evoke a eerily tranquil, slightly horror-inspired and somewhat quirky/cutesy atmosphere.\n\nThe puzzles don't require much if any thought, and the difficulty actually stems from trying to find what you need to click to progress. Mechanically as a puzzle game, it is executed very poorly.\n\nI frankly didn't enjoy this game, because I don't quite understand what it's trying to say or do with its premise, other than create an almost Tim Burton-inspired atmosphere and visuals.

As your alien baby moves from one section to the other it will stop at certain points. At these points you will need to solve a puzzle to help rid whatever is in the aliens way of progression. You do this by interacting with things in the background by clicking on them. These puzzles are simple for the most part and shouldn't hold you up for long.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are very simple and use a dark color pallete. The setting is dark and mysterious and adds wonder as to where you are and what this world is that you are travelling through.\n\nAudio\nAudio was decent and fit the look of the game adding to the atmosphere. For the size of the game, it does its part good.\n\nStory\nI think many people are going to have many different opinions on the story of this game and what it all means in the end. I personally viewed it as a way of showing that even the smallest goals in life, you must work for, and by the time you get thier you may value the journey more than the accomplishment itself.\n\nSummary\nThe Old Tree is a small game, reminiscent of small flash games. With simple puzzles and on rail character movement there is not much to add if your looking for innovative gameplay. However this game is about the journey of you, the alien baby, from the beginning to the end. Their is no story handed to you and it is of the players choice what they take from the experience and how they interpret the experience.\n\nOverall this was a decent game you can easily rip through in a 20 minute break or if your just looking for something unique to try out. I recommend it, as it is free and the short length make it easy to fit in. Its also only a 21mb download. However if you are not a fan of unexplained stories or "on rails" games then this may just be a waste of time.","February 28, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You don't really play the alien so much as you make way for him through the tree by clicking little bits of the background that are far, far too dark to see unless you've raised the brightness on your screen to 11.\n\nThis game is an enjoyable way to while away the time waiting for a pot of water to boil.

She plays it over and over, solving each puzzle and taking the little alien along on his quest.   (She likes Daddy to help with the "roach who keeps turning on the lights").   It is a gentle narrative that keeps her engrossed without getting her overly stimulated.  There is no bloodshed or gore to frighten her, and  it invariably ends on an uplifting note so there's nothing to leave her frustrated.\n\nRedDwarf may want to think about focusing on the 5 and under market.  Their designers obviously have a knack for entertaining little ones (OK, my little one).  And adults will love this as well.  Instead of the sickly sweet ubercute-meets-Uncanny Valley aesthetic favored by many contemporary preschooler games, "The Old Tree" hearkens back to *Forbidden Valley* and 60s/70s animation and illustration.  Daddy found the story touching and the walk through the world fascinating: I am sure other parents will enjoy it as well.

Although a short experience (it took me the amazing 15 minutes to complete it on the first run), it is an enjoyable one.

The green fellow explores the underworld tunnels, slowly moving forward to freedom. You are somthing like a high power, cleaning the path from all obstacles in front of the octopus.\n\nPositives\nA definite good side is the animation and the genera feeling of mysticism in the game. The way items are depicted are also cute and suitable for the idea.\n\nNegatives\nReally short. Too short! There are not much indicaitons about what you have to do. I won't spoil, but at some points it feels like a hidden object game - you just click in the dark. A second negative is the story - it's practically nonexistent, although I managed to put something of a kind in the beginning of this review.\n\nAdvice to the makers:\nImprove your work, add more story and make this the introduction to something that could become as good as Machinarium!","December 10, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Apple Squid is born and you clear its path as it wanders to an unknown destination.  The puzzles are nice, but are beginner level (the only one that actually took time was the electricity/lightning puzzle).  As you follow Apple Squid, it ends up entering a hotel within the tree run by a roach (that looks dead) and some weird mustache cook (Burger Time chef).  After all the puzzle solving,  Apple Squid grabs onto a seed-head dandelion only to be blown away with the wind.\n\n\nPROS\nInteresting art style (gives it an eerie feeling the entire time)\nEasy Puzzles (if you want puzzles that make you feel smart while feeling casual...mostly recommended for kids)\nShort\nEasy\nNo bugs (but there will be literal bugs all-throughout the game)\n\nCONS\nNo story\nNo sense of control\nGame feels creepy when it probably shouldn't\nBORING!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nAfter my experience, I cannot recommend this title.

The more you progress in the game, the weirder the puzzles get.  While the puzzles are fairly simple, they still amaze me by how creative they are and how much fun they were to solve. Even with the dark ambience, the game is some what adorable, and just makes you want to hug the little creature trying to escape the tree.\n\nI did love this game, but I was disappointed by the fact of how short the game is. The game is only 18 minutes long (It was for me anyway), and by the art and creativness, I think this game has true potential! This game should be longer, it dosen't have to be a super long game, but atleast long enough to keep players satisfied.\n\nI digress. Even with the short play time, I think this game was well made. I recommend this game to the fullest, and I hope this reveiw helps in your decision on wheather or not you want to install this game.","March 27, 2015","true","0.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So uncomfortable I felt a great relief when it was finally over in about 15 minutes. The game feels creepy, music is eerie , puzzles have no logic in them so I was just basically clicking everywhere on the screen to get the story moving forward. Luckily the game is free so you can try it out and judge yourself. Some people might find that kind of dark atmosphere interesting, but not me. For comparison I loved another free game called The Plan, which had a much better music and makes you think deeply about everything when it's over. That game is completed in maybe 5 minutes or less but it had a much better positive impact than this one.","January 19","false","0.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

I normally love games like this, and I was a very big fan of the art, the sound direction, and the atmosphere, but I felt the pacing was dragged out too far. Additionally, the controls and puzzles were vague and unintuitive (I spent more time than I'd care to admit clicking mushrooms, thinking that they controlled where the fly was flying and attempting to move the fly and droplet over top of the centepede creature, instead of onto a mushroom that didn't look that special and I wasn't expecting to work like a slingshot). I wasn't always certain of whether I had made something happen or if it would have happened on its own. I think the mouse pointer changing in some way over clickable objects would have definitely helped, as well as an optional hint system (even though the puzzles aren't the hard part, it's figuring out what to interact with).\n\nBut hey, you can't beat the price.","January 27, 2015","false","0.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Don't expect much in terms of gameplay, its more clicking on things and solving simple puzzles but thats not what this game is all about, its more of a work of art than a game.\n\nIts only 10 or 15 minutes long and its free, so you have absolutely nothing to lose. Interestingly, the dev's have just had their next project "Tales of Cosmos" greenlit which is more of a substantial retail adventure game so if you enjoy this experience (which I'm sure you will) then you've got something else to keep your eye on.","February 28, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You got nothing to loose.\n\nThis game is short and free to play. No micro transactions, no market, no nothing. Free and short. That's all you need to know.\n\nWriting this review probably costs me more time than it took me to complete the game. In the time you read this review you could have been half way through the game. Writing this review I realize it doesnt make a whole lot sense to write a long review about a game that only takes between 10 and 15 minutes to complete. If you see people with over 15 min of gameplay they like this game so much they played it over and over or they dont understand the concept of clicking on stuff to advance the story. Without any tutorial or explanation you will get through the game very quickly.\n\nAfter having played the game it leaves me with more questions than answers. What was the "creature" that I just navigated through the game? Why is "this" (you know it after 15min) the way the story ends? In a game with soft music and strange art, you think there is a deeper message. Are we all looking to "climb the tree"? To fly away from what we just achieved? Is this a metafor for life and how we struggle in life to get to the top but in the end are just like "dust in the wind". Is this a game that is going to encourage people to rethink their life? To make them consider what is really important?\n\nWow, after writing down this review I've come to the conclusion that you must download and play this game. Is a game changer, a life changer, a portal to a new life.","April 21, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game itself and the puzzles within it are both very linear, which reduces the joy of discovering the solutions and watching the plot (what little of it there can be in an abstract puzzler).

Twice I sat stuck for a few moments assuming that I had not completed a puzzle, only to find out that I had to click a door in front of me that was the same shade of pitch black as everything else in the background.\n\nThere's no story other than what you make of it, no motive other progression, and no explanation of how a society of insect hotel managers have acquired humanoid robot chefs.  The puzzles are relaxingly simple, and the major flaw of the game can be fixed by jacking up your brightness more than you usually would.

Solve a few of those, and you get to the conclusion, which is not really a conclusion, but rather a beginning.\n\nMake of that what you will.

They are dead wrong. My god, right from the word go I saw the metaphors leaping from the game. The beauty of this game is that even the developers play along and pretend its about nothing more than a sweet little alien! This game deflty covers everything from the concept of cloud seeding by the government to suffrage rights for women in an oppressive world. There's even hints of fear mongering and it raises really interesting questions about quantum physics and its role in your relationship with your parents. You could easily burn a good 5-6 hours on this game, probably more if you want to really dig into the issues it raises. I also found if I recorded the background music and played it backwards at half speed, I could hear the (pretty obvious) voice of Margret Thatcher telling me it was time to get in touch with my inner sexy horse whisperer. This game helped me reidentify with my true calling, and I believe it can do the same for you. 10/10","January 30, 2015","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kallipyge/recommended/346250/","kallipyge","neuroghosts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kallipyge/","14 products in account","Simplistic and slightly creepy.\n\nThis is a point-and-click game that uses a very lovely greyscale and rather creepy artstyle, where you follow the adventure of a strange egg-like thing on its adventures through The Old Tree. It's very specific on how the game wants their sequence of clicks, often leaving the player (me) confused and unengaged while trying to continue through. There is a lot of waiting implemented, where you have to either wait for things to be in position in order to complete a room. I restarted the game to get to a stage that I thought that I messed up, but only to later find that it's just very very specific, and that replaying the game is very boring and not as interesting as its first impression is. The muscis sets the nice creepy atmosphere in its more subtle notes, leaving you to ignore it in the background until it stops and gives some unease.\n\nOverall, it's nice to play if you've got the 15 minutes to spare, but there isn't really a lot to it. I wouldn't really reccommend it. This is a very simple game with a linear storyboard that has little explanation or substance to draw from. But if you'd like to experience the intrigue that it can provide you mood-wise, it's worth considering to play, especially because it's free.","February 7, 2015","false","0.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

However, the resolution is somewhat impared, making it subpar. Also, the way the frames move is very choppy, and could be improved. I would give the visuals a 5/10.\nAlso, the gameplay is tedious and very boring. You only get to do a single action every fifteen seconds or so, making for a very one-tone, uninteresting game. If you could move the character, than this would be a much better. However, the game does this for you, making the numerous movement segments very boring, since all you can do is watch this little white blob move across the screen. I give the gameplay a 1/10\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 4/10, because there are some interesting mechanics. With some touching up, this could become much more than it is. However, I would not play it again in its current state.","February 20, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I don't judge this on basis of lack of content, but I have a few things to criticize: The gamer feels way too passive imo, the game feels slow, a story is just existent in the player's mind if he/she is creative (not even a narrative) and the audio track has too much low frequencies making it sound less bright and to some extent annoying.

Bit of an odd game, having a max length of 30 minutes, no real story, and being a game that is more so watched than played. As the description reads, you help a baby alien make his way through a tree and watch him soar off to his new destination...wherever that might be. You don't control the alien baby. Instead, you act sort of like "God" and click on objects to help the alien baby progress. The alien baby walks on its own. So, alot of this game is just sitting there watching this little apple alien thing crawl around from room to room. There's no underlying theme or symbolism present either, which is something to be expected with this type of silent adventure game. Is it bad? Well, maybe from the description I gave, but in general I don't think it is. It's an ok game. It's an alright time waster. Plus, it's free. So, at least you didn't waste any money on it. You only wasted your time (depending on if you feel that way; me, not exactly). I feel this could be a good setup or prequel/demo to a full-length adventure game. Though, if I were the creators, I'd make sure that the game has a lot more interesting things going on than The Old Tree. Overall, an alright 30 minute potential time waster.","March 7, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is kind of a study in contrasts; cute characters in a dark environment. There is nothing offensive in this game. It leaves a pleasent impression after playing it. There is nothing that could really be called a narrative. It's just a simple, brief experience. I recommend it because it is free. All it will cost you is 10-15 minutes of your time.

You may be thinking, wow, a half hour game, how dumb. You sir, are wrong.\n\nAlright, so you may or may not be this alien, you are definitely following it. There is no story, no background story at least, you are just this alien that is trying to get back to space. Now, what do you do? Control the alien? Nope. You are controlling the environment around him or her, which is surprising cool.\n\nThe graphics don't need to be good, but they are, well at least the environment is, especially in the cave areas. Basically, the alien moves to a certain point and you have to try to find a way to get him/her to progress the level. It is a puzzle game, but it's a point and click puzzle game. Some of the puzzles are really simple, leading to a 3 second progression time and others had me for as long as about 10 minutes (the water one especially) and the puzzle difficulty are the right level, which is the best. It's a free-to-play game, so you can't beat that and it takes about 1 minute to install, this game is fun. No music however, but sound effects which makes the game a lot more mysterious.\n\nYou don't grow any bond on the alien but you do feel bad for him, you have that part where you're despirately wishing that he will find a way home. 30 minutes worth of gameplay is enough for this game, no story and just a ton of puzzles for maybe an hour more would be a little boring. No multiplayer neither a title screen, if there was one complaint I had about the game was that there are no options or title screen, that would have been nice to mess around with. There's no title for the game when you are playing either however, an Adobe 11 message is what fills your screen.\n\nFor a free-to-play, 30 minute, puzzle game (no spoilers) but a quick but enjoyable ending, point and click, no music but errie feel, alien loving, bee crushing, soup making, water cranking, bee-water-carrying, this game will give you nothing less than a fun and good time, is it replayability worth? Yup, I do have to say.\n\nWho else thought the alien had a green apple as his head at the beginning? -Detroit0127","March 1, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Old Tree is a short game that takes very little time to complete, however, it inspires many different feelings throughout the course of the game.\n\nGameplay:\nMy playthrough took about 20 minutes, which I have noticed is about the average for most people. The moves encompassed the 'w,s,a,d' buttons (really, mostly just the 'a and d' buttons) and your mouse. For this game, those movements worked perfectly to get you from point A to point B.\n\nGraphics:\nThe developers have done a very good job keeping your focus on the alien-baby you are controlling, with darker undertones for the background. This accentuates the vivid coloring of your character. I thought the graphics were well done with a sort of 'drawn on' effect.\n\nAudio:\nThe music for this game is phenomenal! The melodies of course changed with different scenes, but did not take away from the experience in anyway. Instead, the music only enhanced the action!  The songs themselves did more for the general ambience of the game then everything else (gameplay/graphics).\n\nStoryline:\nThis game has a very basic storyline that is really easy to follow. It seemed to me as though is was kind of a twist to the point and click genre. Your alien-baby is on rails throughout the game, and you only move ahead once you can sort out the puzzle. The puzzles are simplistic for the most part and do not take a lot of time to get through, so the overall flow of the game is not broken up.\n\nThere are so many ways to experience this game, and I think most people will have varying opinions on what it all is supposed to mean. To me, it started out symbolizing fear. Fear of the unknown, and what was to come for such a tiny creature. It then moved into more of a feeling of triumph, and the knowledge that one can do anything, as long as the will and the effort are there. With a game that takes under half an hour to complete, the playthrough is still a very pleasant occasion. Overall, I believe that this game is completely worth it, and I would highly recommend it, especially because it is offered for free.","April 27, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You may be thinking, wow, a half hour game, how dumb. You sir, are wrong.\n\nAlright, so you may or may not be this alien, you are definitely following it. There is no story, no background story at least, you are just this alien that is trying to get back to space. Now, what do you do? Control the alien? Nope. You are controlling the environment around him or her, which is surprising cool.\n\nThe graphics don't need to be good, but they are, well at least the environment is, especially in the cave areas. Basically, the alien moves to a certain point and you have to try to find a way to get him/her to progress the level. It is a puzzle game, but it's a point and click puzzle game. Some of the puzzles are really simple, leading to a 3 second progression time and others had me for as long as about 10 minutes (the water one especially) and the puzzle difficulty are the right level, which is the best. It's a free-to-play game, so you can't beat that and it takes about 1 minute to install, this game is fun. No music however, but sound effects which makes the game a lot more mysterious.\n\nYou don't grow any bond on the alien but you do feel bad for him, you have that part where you're despirately wishing that he will find a way home. 30 minutes worth of gameplay is enough for this game, no story and just a ton of puzzles for maybe an hour more would be a little boring. No multiplayer neither a title screen, if there was one complaint I had about the game was that there are no options or title screen, that would have been nice to mess around with. There's no title for the game when you are playing either however, an Adobe 11 message is what fills your screen.\n\nFor a free-to-play, 30 minute, puzzle game (no spoilers) but a quick but enjoyable ending, point and click, no music but errie feel, alien loving, bee crushing, soup making, water cranking, bee-water-carrying, this game will give you nothing less than a fun and good time, is it replayability worth? Yup, I do have to say.\n\nWho else thought the alien had a green apple as his head at the beginning? -Detroit0127","March 1, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bit of an odd game, having a max length of 30 minutes, no real story, and being a game that is more so watched than played. As the description reads, you help a baby alien make his way through a tree and watch him soar off to his new destination...wherever that might be. You don't control the alien baby. Instead, you act sort of like "God" and click on objects to help the alien baby progress. The alien baby walks on its own. So, alot of this game is just sitting there watching this little apple alien thing crawl around from room to room. There's no underlying theme or symbolism present either, which is something to be expected with this type of silent adventure game. Is it bad? Well, maybe from the description I gave, but in general I don't think it is. It's an ok game. It's an alright time waster. Plus, it's free. So, at least you didn't waste any money on it. You only wasted your time (depending on if you feel that way; me, not exactly). I feel this could be a good setup or prequel/demo to a full-length adventure game. Though, if I were the creators, I'd make sure that the game has a lot more interesting things going on than The Old Tree.

I feel that if the writer had so little to say, they must not have formed a valid opinion on the game. They must not care enough to give a well thought out review. That said, it's kind of hard to say a lot about this game, but here goes...\n\nIt's very short. I think it took me about 10 minutes. The art style is kind of a study in contrasts; cute characters in a dark environment. There is nothing offensive in this game. It leaves a pleasent impression after playing it. There is nothing that could really be called a narrative. It's just a simple, brief experience. I recommend it because it is free. All it will cost you is 10-15 minutes of your time.

I don't judge this on basis of lack of content, but I have a few things to criticize: The gamer feels way too passive imo, the game feels slow, a story is just existent in the player's mind if he/she is creative (not even a narrative) and the audio track has too much low frequencies making it sound less bright and to some extent annoying.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentwill7/recommended/346250/","silentwill7","Silentwill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentwill7/","362 products in account","The Old Tree is a short puzzle-based animation game of watching a baby alien explore its environment, which you can finish in around 15 minutes. I went in with a low expectations of the game, and I could only say that I'm glad I did. I don't have many complaints about the premise of the game and its puzzle mechanics, but as for the entire game itself... it leaves many things to be desired.\n\nThe main problem with the game is that it lacks any form of development, i.e. the baby alien you're playing as stays a baby until the end, and after going through a simple series of puzzles, you finish the game without any form of conclusion or ending. For me, playing through this game did not leave me with any sense of satisfaction or accomplishment.\n\nI think the game has potential, but that potential was wasted with the game's lack of content. If you have time to spare and want to see a very basic indie game with good puzzle mechanics, then by all means try it out. Otherwise, move on and spend your 15 minutes playing some other game that's more worthwhile.","July 6, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But for a short free game, I'd say the experience was interesting. I loved the atmosphere.\n\nI'll simply put it like this:\nIf you enjoy games with a good atmosphere, give it go.

Anyway, for those that want a little bit more information here we go:-\n\nThis is an odd little 'on rails' 'puzzle' game. Do not get overly excited though, as the whole game is completable in about 10 minutes (well what do expect for free?).\n\nYou play as a weird little 4 limbed octopus type alien creature in a surreal world, well I say 'play as', but really it just moves along when it stops you use your mouse to complete a puzzle to get the alien to move again. The game world consists of a few dark tunnels, a kitchen, a lobby and couple of outside bits mostly in hand drawn looking blacks and greys with the odd little smudge of faded colour here and there. Overall the visuals are fairly unique and have an 'indie' look to them which you will either like (a bit) or hate.\n\nThere is a simple yet eerie ambient sound track in the background which helps add to the limited atmosphere and is not unpleasant to listen to. Game play wise you progress along a predetermined course and solve simple puzzles to reach your goal, which is just freedom I guess.\n\nThe puzzles are as straight forward as clicking a glowing red dot in the dark to switch on a light, to working out how to get into a flood-able section of tunnel and then re-flood it to get onto the ceiling amongst other stuff. It's certainly not going to strain your brain although there are often no clues as to what you have to do, so sometimes it's just a case of trail and error or just click on everything you can see and see if it reacts. It's not as frustrating as it sounds as you'll work out how to solve each puzzle within an attempt or two.\n\nIf they were charging say £0.70 for the game I'd say it was over priced and only worth about £0.10. But as it is free I think you should add it to your collection, even if it's just so you can complete it and increase your (probably) horrifically low 'Avg. Game Completion Rate' found in your profile.\n\n(*spoiler - In the lobby there is a switch behind the plant on the left, you need to switch off the light, then click the red switch and repeat a few times to call the elevator. This is probably the hardest puzzle in the game)","December 13, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Would recommend to anyone trying to kill some time . Only complaint is the lack of a save feature but it is short enough that it isn't a big problem. Also it is often pretty dark and isn't always easy to tell what to click but over all it is fun.","February 2, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as an alien (i think) making its way...  somewhere, and, with the help of light and sometimes a flying insect, you proceed. I thought the dull title did not do this game justice, and I did not see any trees - old or otherwise, anywhere.  10/10 point and click.","May 30, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ofcourse it's just a small casual title, but I had 15 really nice minutes of playthrough. Mostly I was admireing visual aspects and great ambient soundtrack, but it was worth of speding this time with that title. Any criticism? It was a bit to dark for me what made me few times to point like crazy all over the screen to find something in the dark. Generally - thumbs up :D","September 26, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
