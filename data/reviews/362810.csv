Think super smash bros but much faster paced. A simple must buy with a great price.

(no p2w)\n\nNo pay to win.\n\nPlayer base big enough that playing online is easy.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nCons:\n\nNo dedicated servers. (Meaning, the games you are in are hosted by other players, so sometimes it is laggy.\n\nSystem for unlocking new characters is kinda silly. You can spend thousands of ingame money and not get any characters or get lucky and spend 25 and get new characters.

And they only have.. two moves each. But (most of them) are designed in a way that you'll have to know when to use something, and how to use it correctly.

What a solid first development.\n\nLet me start by saying the screenshots dont do it justice. The graphics, once in a game, are surprisingly smooth and polished.\n\nCharacter design is excellent. Each character has wholly unique abilities and play style, which is an achievement rarely reached with such a large cast of characters. This is the major selling point for me. Each character you unlock will have genuinely unique skillsets/stats that will require a completely different strategy in game.\n\nMany recent 2-D platform based competitive arena games dont add many new concepts, this is not the case with fighties. Combat is original and thoughtful, and they have not fallen into the trap of lazilly knocking off the abilities of other characters to complete their lineup.\n\nThe price, when compared to similar games, is incredibly generous considering the content. Honestly this game blows away other games with the same price. The price could be doubled, or possibly even trippled and still be reasonable.","July 14, 2015","true","25.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Needler is still op in arcade mode and allows me to complete this boss with some gud random powerups but it still takes way too many tries. Hoping the change the order of the bosses or something later on. The game crashed once on me at the start but it hasn't happened again so that's gud. I also like how needler's bar thingies can be destroyed with melee attacks. He's still extremely gud though.\n\nEdit #2: Now I have to refight the op boss to beat normal mode. Good thing I chose needler again.\n\nEdit #3: That second boss though! It was freaking harder than I thought it would be as needler. I won't spoil anything but damn, it was hard. Felt gud when I beat it though.\n\nEdit #4: Multiplayer is dead at the moment b/c of lack of updates.

You face more enemies and more bosses (from 1 on easy to 3 on hard) as difficulty increases, also previous bosses HP increase, and let me tell you, both arcade modes (there is two version, each with their own 3 bosses) are HARD, depending on the character you are facing the boss it might be nearly impossible.\n\nThe hard boss on arcade 2 is a complete nut buster, The challenge is quite on par with most AAA figthing games and you will need to master all the movements mechanics and skills of your character to succeed.\n\nThere is one complain about this game, some characters are clearly stronger and easier to use and others frustratingly hard to use or have a not-so-useful skill.

By this I mean fights are generally one sided based on what character you are facing/playing as. A few of the characters can instantly kill their opponents while the rest were given the short end of the stick, and can't score a kill for what seems like an undetermined amount of hits. You know there is a balancing problem when a handful of characters can kill from across the screen, while some melee character can't even kill in close range.\n\nAnother problem this game features is that once you've respawned you can immediatly be killed before you have the chance to react. This makes arcade mode even more difficult than it already is especially once you get to a two versus one, or a boss level. Bosses are nearly impossible unless you are playing as a character who instant kills even more so when the boss can kill you in one hit.","December 20, 2015","false","0.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

This is a brawler platformer with some creativty behind the combat and the characters. The game isn't difficult to get a basic understanding of and it's a great game to play with friends I had no issues with the game other than 2 major things. First I had issues with it's netcode the online multiplayer seems to bug out response time with friends. Secondly the game's Bosses tended to feel boring as it was rinse and repeat with the combat. Other than those two factors this game is a solid pick up and easy to fall in love with i'd give this game a 9/10.","October 16, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

WATAFAK. Anyway this game is a fast paced 2-D fighting game that its main attraction is its price; at only $5.99 it has 30 characters which is more than MKX (at only 29) and many more than popular indie games such as Skullgirls (featuring only 12!)\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nDiverse characters - Having only unlocked about 20 of the 30 availiable charaters I allready can see that the roster is vary diverse in their playstyle and in thier looks.\nFluid controls - Coming from a console when I play a fighting game I expect controls that represent what I want to happen very well and imediatly, and this game does this very well.  Also im not sure if im just incompotent or just blind but i cant find an option to change the keybindings anywhere, could someone please point that out.\nAwesome art style - Seriously, if you dont think this art is awesome you must be new to this planet because the pixel art is just so brilliant. Its bright and vivid colours make it almost pop culture and the character design is just brilliant.  My favourite is the red hair dude in the bottom left, hes a good lad and can fly, not even a "good" character in my opinion but he looks cool and thats enough for me\nCons\n\nRidiculous boss fight - You fight your way up a ladder so to speak, pretty standard stuff until you reach a skull icon  "ohh a boss fight, sp00ky"  I told myself just before staying up still 3 just to beat the d**m thing. Seriously these bosses will make you cry\nDifficult to find help - I know this will come with time, but if your search up "Fighting char list"  21st july 2015 10:19 pm  its comes up with your bog standard MKX and street fighter character list, very difficult when your trying to find OP characters to beat the F***ing Bee boss as.\nLimited Community - No matter how hard you try, at no point I could find another player online, I doubt the game is dead but, maybe a sale or something just to put up the numbers might just be in order. I can see this game being brilliant with a community.  Pillowpig take notes  Or you could make the game "free to play" and give out credits with money this would make the community much, much bigger and you could still get money from it.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion for $5.99 your seriously getting a better deal than you should, even though the community is limited its still worth a buy. It does what many fighting games seek out to do but doesnt get flustered with "cheap money making tactics" that are dead obvious  MKX selling you "EZ fatalities"  instead it creates a solid fighting game that is well worked on and the effort put into it really shows, with a solid playerbase this game could seriously take off and become an extremely sucsessful business.\n\nGrade\n\nOverall I give this game 9/10, and the only thing it could do to improve that is get more players  (do a free weekend or a sale)\n\nNote, I have many more hours than 1.7 on this game because I play it at school it is so good, Naughty, Naughty me\n\nNote, nerf the damn guy with the cards, he is very OP","July 21, 2015","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I guess it's alright for that, definitely not the best though.\n\nIf you're looking for a fighting game with some form of skill cap, this isn't for you.

The gameplay is pretty fast-paced and fun, the characters all have their own unique play-styles that changes the game up a bit, the pixel art is really nice to look at, and there's a decent amount of content. There are a couple of flaws, though.\n\nFor one, the game's pretty unbalanced as some characters have attacks that can easily kill someone in one hit, while others have attacks that will take a couple of hits before it can kill someone. This can make the Arcade mode pretty annoying at times for some playable characters as you don't really have a lot of lifes on matches in Arcade mode and some attacks can kill you instantly.\n\nAnother issue is that the audio in the game isn't very good. The soundtrack could use a little bit more work as it consists of small and short tunes that wouldn't even work as ringtones, and the sound effects are pretty bland.\n\nDespite those issues, though, I still really enjoyed this game. It's no Super Smash Brothers by any means, but it's still a neat, little game to play with friends. Plus, it's only 5$, so you won't be spending too much on this game.","January 9","true","11.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The rest of the characters are easily fit into the difficulties when fighting them, and you can still lose and get frustrated. However, the ninja boss at the end of the easy difficulty took me way too many tries. I became frustrated and wanted to quit, but being a stubborn person I was able to beat him. It took me an hour. I feel like the spike in difficulty will drive away many players to the game, and I would suggest a few less hearts since he also has the ability to appear wherever he pleases to kill you every. single time.","July 20, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has an awesome set of fighters, about half of which you have to unlock through a fairly random arcade style crane game. Most of the fighters have unique move sets with a matching look.\nThe game boasts three modes. A typical versus mode (both off and online), two arcade modes that put in a series of 1v1, group, and boss battles, and a survival mode that can be played single player or co-op, where you go against waves of enemies in increasing difficulty.\nThis is the time of game where each fighter is unique enough that I'm going to try and beat the arcade mode with each and every one.\nI haven't sunk that much time in the game so far but I felt the need to review already. Arcade is a great mode for solo play, and although it isn't incredibly long, the uniqueness in characters and difficulty settings offers the replayability that one would want. And with both co-op and versus modes, this is a great game to play with friends.\nThe only downsides I've found are in enemy AI, at times on the easier mode they do not play competitively and do somewhat confusing things. This does not happen often and I've only seen it on easy difficult, so it is nothing to worry about.\nThe way you unlock characters is somewhat frustrating due to the fact that you will get various items MANY times before you'll get a hero, but to be fair that does make the times you get a new hero feel even better, and with a large roster to fill it leaves for many characters to win.\n\nFighties was made by only two people as I saw when I beat the arcade mode the first time and the shortest credits I've seen in my life came up. These two did an amazing job and at its current price ($5) I think you'd be hard pressed to spend your money in a better place.","November 19, 2015","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every character has their own unique way to attacking that revolves heavily around their special move, whether that is a teleport, a buff or a one-shot move.\nI'd recommend this to anyone looking to buy a game to play with a group of friends as it offers hours of gameplay and it will keep your attention with it's cute character design, fast paced action and relative simplicity while offering a depth of mastery to be learned.\nIt's only downside is that the only way sure-fire way to get a character is by beating the end boss for each difficulty setting in Arcade mode after that it is all luck based in the crane game.

You can play online or locally and have a great time. Each character is really unique in their own way and they bring their own characteristics to the fight making each fight different. Combat consists of 2 buttons with directional inputs influencing attack patterns which helps give more variety to what you're doing. The thing is, even though the control scheme is so simple you'll spend so much time moving around, evading attacks, planning your own attacks and using your reflexes to help you stay alive and kill your opponents. You unlock new characters by playing the game and getting coins to play a crane game to scoop them up. Depending on your skill with the game you could unlock all the characters within 5-10 hours and have them all at your disposal for the fun of multiplayer versus or co-op survival.\n\nI highly recommend this awesome game and it is immensely worth the asking price of $4.99","July 25, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has an awesome set of fighters, about half of which you have to unlock through a fairly random arcade style crane game. Most of the fighters have unique move sets with a matching look.\nThe game boasts three modes. A typical versus mode (both off and online), two arcade modes that put in a series of 1v1, group, and boss battles, and a survival mode that can be played single player or co-op, where you go against waves of enemies in increasing difficulty.\nThis is the time of game where each fighter is unique enough that I'm going to try and beat the arcade mode with each and every one.\nI haven't sunk that much time in the game so far but I felt the need to review already. Arcade is a great mode for solo play, and although it isn't incredibly long, the uniqueness in characters and difficulty settings offers the replayability that one would want. And with both co-op and versus modes, this is a great game to play with friends.\nThe only downsides I've found are in enemy AI, at times on the easier mode they do not play competitively and do somewhat confusing things. This does not happen often and I've only seen it on easy difficult, so it is nothing to worry about.\nThe way you unlock characters is somewhat frustrating due to the fact that you will get various items MANY times before you'll get a hero, but to be fair that does make the times you get a new hero feel even better, and with a large roster to fill it leaves for many characters to win.\n\nFighties was made by only two people as I saw when I beat the arcade mode the first time and the shortest credits I've seen in my life came up. These two did an amazing job and at its current price ($5) I think you'd be hard pressed to spend your money in a better place.","November 19, 2015","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is quiet enjoyable especially with friends with fast and slick controls and fun gameplay. But I have a few problems with the game, first of all the music is quiet terrible, the music sounds like something out of the NES bootlegs you could buy in China, I myself found that the music can be changed by replacing the .ogg files in the files, I changed it to the Scott Pilgrim OST which I think fits more, my second problem is the items, they have your basic buffs such as speed, power, health and debuffs also, but the way they are presented are a little confusing, they have the textures of stuffed animals that change colour, I don't know if the other colour varients have something different about them but I havent been able to figure it out, Its difficult to understand what item does what without playing before such as Giraffe = 1UP? Sometimes I ran into the items getting debufs on my speed making some fights impossible to do (Especially the boss fights)\nMy Final problem was the over balance and under balance of certain characters, some characters feel way too strong such as the Mime character that can spawn a copy of himself that throws cards that insta-kill and this is quiet tricky to counter, and other characters such as the one who can climb walls feels to weak to do anything. I think this game has some good potential and is well worth a look, its a really good game for £3.99 and these where my only concerns that I thought should be addressed.","December 11, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

A diverse roster with unique moves, dashing, double jumps, stock mode is better than other modes and a goofy collectable minigame. However a few things make it feel very different.\n1. Animations are super simple. One or two frames really.\n2. Two moves per character and almost all of them are one hit kills.\n3. Floaty. No character feels as if they have much weight at all.\n\nAll of this leads to a game that plays very very fast. Every character has their two moves which all have different levels of cooldown. I must commend the creators for making each and every character feel unique. However some of them are maybe 'too unique'. If there were a tier list for this game half of the roster would be piled up at the bottom. Still me and my friends have come up with very creative ways to use even the worst characters.\n\nHowever most people I try to play with give up after a game or two. The insta-death is very discouraging in this game compared to other games with one hit kills. The reason most have given me is that they feel like they had no options for dealing with the death. They think that due to their character choice they stood no chance against whatever the others were playing.\n\nThe characters all look cute even if they are a tad generic. The stages all look fine but I think they would benefit from some animation, even some simple stuff like leaves or rain. I really detest the music, I get that his is suppossed to be cutesy game and all but the music is just flat out bad. It doesn't match the pace of the game at all and to be honest barely sounds like music.\n\nIn conclusion this game is not for everyone. I would give some videos a look and maybe give it a try if you can before buying as this game really rides on its first impression.","February 7","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like Battle Block Theater and TF2 had a baby (Sorta, not really)! The art is nice, gamplay is nice, but this only thing I didn't like were the defualt controls, I had to mess around with them for 45 minutes to see what felt comfertable... (My controls: WASD to move, Space to jump, J for normal attack, K for spcial, and L to roll) but now that I have the controls sorted out, I can play all I want.","December 25, 2015","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Luckily, my friend bought it for me and believe me when I played it once, I kept playing it for 5 hours. If you have nothing better to do, load up Fighties and watch a couple of hours fly by. It has a few things that need to be fixed but to me it's worth it's price. Overall 8/10","February 13","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Especially When its on sale. It has its fair share of problems though so keep that in mind.\n\nExamples being that it's a little too hard in an unreasonable way. I understand Hard mode is, well.. Hard. but it's kind of rediculous. That and Puppet master needs to be changed. Along with Eskimo dude. Seriously. Change that ♥♥♥♥","January 2","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's only playable lacally and with a contoller, if you don't take my advice, you wont have any fun.  There's no story, but the arcade mode is amazing.  Finally there's the hand to hand combat with your friends that is phenominal.\nRating:\n11/10 would rek some ninja dudes again","May 24","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
