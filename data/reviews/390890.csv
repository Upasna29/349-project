"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scottz/recommended/390890/","scottz","|PCΔ| scottzorz |LAB|","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scottz/","195 products in account","In Angry Arrows, you take upon the role of Legolas who has to battle hordes of Uruk-hai to rescue Princess Zelda from  the Legend of Zelda series in an alternate timeline in which she no longer wears a dress and has brown hair. Despite no longer being blonde, Zelda has gotten significantly more stupid: the alternate dimension has stripped her of her Triforce of Wisdom, leaving her with only two apparent skills: getting kidnapped and catching arrows with her face.\n\nIn this timeline, the wizard Saruman has improved the Uruks originally created by Sauron: he made them green and also very good at shooting long bows. Also, he invented suicide bomber spiders or something; he can do that, he's a wizard, you know.\n\nAnyways, in this quest to rescue Princess Zelda twenty-five times, Legolas can rescue Zelda alone or with up to three other companions: Link, Hawkeye, or Red the Green Arrow on the same machine with local co-op. However, Legolas works alone, which is why I worked through the campaign by myself without any other person's help. And no other reason.\n\nBesides rescuing Princess Zelda, you can also play as Garrett that guy from Thief and be in a sneaky forest in a randomly generated time trials kind of game thing, or you can also play as some guy who fights orcs in a gladitorial arena. As with the campaign mode, these other modes can also be played with others in local co-op, although Garrett and this hypothetical gladiator also work alone in their lore, which is also why I opted to not receive assistance in these modes. And for no other reason.\n\nThere is also a deathmatch PvP mode, but, as I have mastered this game, I thought it would be unsporting to decimate the competition. Therefore, I have not played deathmatch for this reason. And for no other reason.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the most succinct way to describe this game is simply try playing Hotline Miami with a controller, but then also you have to use a bow instead of a machine gun or shotgun. Also, instead of having a 80s bee bop soundtrack like Hotline Miami, this game has a much more soothing soundtrack in campaign mode while you scream obscenities at your computer for being a ♥♥♥♥ing piece of absolute ♥♥♥♥ for not ♥♥♥♥ing reading your ♥♥♥♥ing inputs ♥♥♥♥ this game cheats so much ♥♥♥♥ everything broke ♥♥♥ game 10/10 would put disk in blender if it was on a disk.\n\nAlso, the game is less than the price of a sandwich from Subway. I mean, I don't know what else you would do with $5 if you had it, but you certainly couldn't buy a footlong from Subway. That's how cheap this game is: it costs less than a sandwich.\n\nAlso, the system requirements are a bit high, and the 13 whole MB it takes up on my hard drive is a little bit excessive. Had to uninstall GTA V and overclock my i7 in order to support this massive game.\n\n10/10 would not recommend to people concurrently in anger management therapy.","August 14, 2015","true","6.7"," 75 of 92 people (82%) found this review helpful 80 people found this review funny","82","75","92","80","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/390890/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Angry Arrows is a small game made by independent developer Daniel Davis. You play as an archer who is sent to enemy camp where hostage is held, to kill all hostiles and save the princess captive.\n\nControls are made with focus on being precise, and the game reacts properly, without any delay. You can move, roll and shoot (to any selected direction). Controls reminds me of another indie game, Titan Souls (though there you could use only one arrow, Angry Arrows allows you to spam as many arrows as you want).\n\nDifficulty of the game is set pretty high and requires a patient player. If you can get angry and tilted pretty fast, this isn't a worthwhile pick for you. There aren't any checkpoints, each level (though they are not long) requires to be beaten without dying. There aren't any lives - one shot, one kill, and that applies to both player and the enemy NPCs.\n\nBut the NPCs aren't everything to make your playthrough harder, there are also mines, explosive barrels and, mainly, fast annoying spider mines. They like to jump on your head, but trust me, you won't like it.\n\nThere are four modes in the game - campaign (25 levels), endless arena, rogue (procedurally generated levels) and multiplayer arena. Game as a whole is perfectly polished (for a cheap game made by yet unknown developer), everything works great - responsiveness, menu screens, gamepad compatibility.\n\nConclusion:Angry Arrows is a great game for those who want to play something small but difficult, and is also great example many poor indie developers should check, as they could learn something about making the cheap game polished (say hello to Digital Homicide).\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 11","true","0.6"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

And they almost never miss! The game gets really fun in co-op mode (local only!). If one of the players dies and the other one is still alive, you respawn after five seconds. So you can strategize, like spreading out or one player heads out and the other cowardly hides behind a wall. So in campaign mode you try to reach a hostage and bring him/her to the exit, while not being killed by mines, enemies and robots. Some more enemy types or traps would be cool, though we haven't finished the campaign yet, so maybe there's more than these three types.\nThere's also a couple of other modes, Gladiator mode (fighting wave after increasing wave of enemies) and Rogue mode, which introduces random seed forests in which you only have a limited time to free a hostage. I did not think these two modes added a whole lot to the game.\nVersus mode, however, was great, you can choose between four different types and it adds a lot of replayability.\nWe played this with two xbox360 controllers and after a bit of practice, the aiming feels precise and fast, so no complains about the controls.\nAll in all, great co-op game for a low price, recommended!","August 13, 2015","true","4.5"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","17","20","2","0"

It's a really adrenaline/jumpy kind of game. It borders on challenging and frustrating. Getting shot is shocking, when spider mines run towards you you're packing it as you have one shot to get them. (Two if you're quick and can land the dodge)\n\nYou can roll, hide behind walls and lure enemies by shooting arrows near them. Or lure them onto a mine if you're canny.\nIt's a short game with loads of potential to expand.

AND GO!\n\n\nI can't believe only three people have reviewed this game, I absolutely love it. I never expected a game this simplistic could be so fun and so hard at the same time. The main objective of angry arrows is to kill the enemy who has the key, unlock the cage that has the hostage, and get out safely. Sounds pretty easy right? Absolutely not! One shot will kill you requiring you to think out strategies to take out enemies before they have the chance to hit you, you only have the ability to shoot and roll out of the way of arrows. It has so many good things going for it too. The campaign mode is difficult and requires you to think out strategies instead of charging into battle. The rogue mode randomly generates a level in the forest for you to complete based on a random set of numbers, or a seed. The gladiator mode has you set in an arena facing down increasingly difficult waves of enemies who come your way. The final mode is just a simple versus mode where you and at least one other person fight each other to the death.\n\nAll in all this game is amazing, and for the price it is at you shouldn't even hesitate to buy this game immediatly!","August 14, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Bu I'm not exactly itching to get three friends together to try it.\n\nAngry Arrows is a game where it's very easy to die. Which is fine. But between enemies that can shoot you with their instant kill arrows from offscreen or through walls, having to restart the level after every death (which, with the mostly empty level design, means up to a minute before you'll see any kind of gameplay again), and being forced to escort an NPC who dies even more easily than you do, it's just not worth it. It wasn't enough to make me frustrated, let alone angry. I just couldn't shake the feeling that I could be doing something better with my time.\n\nGood "hard" games like Super Meat Boy put you back in the action ASAP so there's no time to get bored or frustrated. In Angry Arrows, you'll spend more time respawning or walking to where the enemies are than you do fighting or doing anything fun.\n\nThe game suggests a controller but does give you the option of WASD+Keyboard. Unfortunately, there's no way to view or rebind keys and all control/tutorial prompts in the game assume you're using a controller. Including the menus, which are pretty tough to navigate because of it. Sloppy.\n\nFinal nail in the coffin was the "rogue mode" which adds very slightly randomly generated levels. Stop calling your games roguelikes just because you came up with a rudimentary procedural generation system.","September 20, 2015","false","0.3"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","10","23","3","0"

Playing alone is alright, but it gets boring quick. The real fun comes from playing with friends. It is so funny that you can team kill eachother. We usually spend more time killing eachother than the actual enemies.","October 4, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
