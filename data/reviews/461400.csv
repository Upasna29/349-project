It is a pretty straight-forward game, you pick a character, pick a weapon, shoot aliens, repeat. You have a nice amount of alien weapons to choose from.\n\nGraphics\nIt is a pixel art style game, wich gives it a retro theme. It is beautifly drawn and high quality. Guns have good detail and characters have nice clothing,\n\nGameplay\nYou have 2 modes: Adventure and Survival. In adventure you kill aliens in order to get to the boss in each stage. Each stage has approximately 5 levels before the boss appears. Also to make it less repetitive, each level is randomly generated so everyone has a unique expirience. In survival... well the title says it all, kill endless waves of aliens until you die. Multiplayer is slowly being implemented but come soon.\n\nAudio and Music\nBeautiful. Needless to say audio and music have been created by true professionals, Guns have nice shoot sounds while music has awesome genres like Rock, Electronic and Orchestral.\n\nCommunity\nAs Massive just came out, the community is small but is slowly building up. I will not talk about the community as it is too small to say anything about it.\n\nFinal Result\nPros:\n\n- Straight-forward, no tutorial needed\n\n- High Quality Retro Pixel art graphics\n\n- Fair amount of game modes\n\n- Beautiful Soundtrack\n\n- Randomly Generated levels\n\n- (Soon) Cross-platform multiplayer\n\nCons:\n\n- Small community\n\n- Repetitive gameplay\n\n-  Still in development","April 18","true","3.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Weapons feel and sound great (and there're quite a few weapon options too). My main gripe is that there doesn't seem to be much variety in terms of enemy behavior. Thankfully, boss fights change things up and offers some variety. Will definitely be following the game through its updates to see how it grows!","April 26","true","0.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snugsound/recommended/461400/","snugsound","Snug","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snugsound/","89 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n(full disclosure: the dev provided me with a free key, however, I'm going to be as objective as possible as it does nobody a favour to write a generic positive review!)\n\nFirst impressions:the controls were not immediately obvious to me, and in some cases, unintuitive (IMO). For example, it's X (or Start) to confirm in menus, not A; it's X to shoot, not right trigger; etc.\nthis game is VERY similar to Nuclear Throne, to the point that one could throw around the word "clone". I'm not going to, though, because it's obvious that this is a labour of love and not a quick cash-grab: it looks great, feels good, and there are lots of subtle little details.\nthis game is HARD, maybe a bit too hard in its current form (see below)\nThings I'd like to see:more "prompting" (i.e. "press Y to pick-up a weapon"), some sort of a help or "controls" screen\nconfigurable controls or alternate control schemes (per the above)\na difficulty setting, and/or a gradual increase in the difficulty. As it stands, enemies immediately start swarming you before you've even figured out how to pick up a weapon ;)\nhealth pick-ups (maybe these are introduced later in the game, but I didn't make it very far)\nSo far, Massive looks quite promising; I'd suggest checking it out if you're into games like Nuclear Throne. I will definitely give it another shot in the future when it's progressed a bit further.","May 1","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"
