The objective is to pilot your small spacecraft / drone through different environments and land it on all of the landing pads of each level as quickly as possible.  The challenge is that you have to deal with gravity, environmental hazards, and landing pads that are sometimes camouflaged or obscured. Similar to the original Atari Lunar Lander, there isn't any combat and you don't ferry any cargo. The environments you pilot your ship through are varied and imaginative, and you can further challenge your flying skills by flying through rings in a type of challenge mode.  There is also a ‘hard’ mode that basically makes flying your ship a much more manual and hands-on process, as well as hidden objects to find throughout the game. For the modest asking price, there is a good amount of content. It doesn’t take too long to see everything, but a lot of the fun comes from the challenge of completing levels as quickly and as recklessly as possible. I feel this type of game appeals mainly to a niche audience, and if you fall into that niche this game is worth checking out.","February 5, 2015","true","26.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It is a pretty simple game, works well with xbox controller and keeps your fastest time amongst other things. The only fault it has is that there is no online leaderboard so you can check your time against your friends. Slightly addicting good time waster.","October 16, 2015","true","2.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a good casual game which has simple controls (k/m or gamepad) but takes skill to master and control your ship. Also, I like a lot of the in-game music too, and some levels I just enjoy replaying as the immersion is good if you have an Oculus Rift. I recommend this title, especially for the price.","February 19, 2015","true","1.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Good mechanics and controls making your lander feel real. A unique challenge. All levels are accessable from the start so you don't get blocked if you cannot get through a tricky level.\nThe later levels have some fun with proceedural generatiion and it works pretty well. Would benefit from adding steam achievements - especially if they take into account which control mode you use.","February 6, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Mediocre physics gameplay. Terrible presentation.\n\nThe basic premise is solid. Using your Lunar lander, land on platforms in sequence as quickly as possible while trying to avoid collision damage which will make you explode. There are a lot of good ideas in the levels which vary from landing on moving platforms to flying through consecutive rigs, to finding hidden areas to navigating very tight spaces. Its enough to keep it realatively interesting. The downside is the camera which runs into issues in tigh spaces and the sheer pointless scale of the levels. In some levels the game has you traveling very long distances for no aparent reason.\n\nWhere the game really falls off is the presentation. While the basic craft is quite functional, its visually uninteresting and has no clear front, back or sides. The majority of the levels are built from ambiguous shapes and poorly built random models that make no cohesive sense. The lack of clearly reccognizable scale elements makes it difficult to tell where you are, where you have been and how far things are at times.\n\nIf you are a big fan of physics puzzles and lunar lander style games, its worth picking up on sale. For anyone else, I would avoid this game.","July 19, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I already got like, 15 hours into the game.\n\nI just want:\n•more levels & hidden collectables.\n•higher quality/reasonably more difficult places/objects to manuver around\n•better looking worlds (altho the graphics aren't terrible, and I'm glad it has it's own style.)\n\nI feel like this game needs to borrow a bit from games like:\n•I am Bread\n•Games with memorable, engaging atmosphere and settings in the sci-fi genre\n\nPROS:\n^•^ Get this game for the thrill of crashing a rock with thrusters into things ... Or for the difficulty and satisfaction of piloting the most delicate dounut-box ship onto pads like a Mother@#$%ing boss.\n^•^ You feel like casually floating onto small pads is easy and boring? There's a stop watch taped to your @$$ that will make you RUSH like HELL to beat the impossible times, while balencing between speed and control. Only true pilots can achive 3 stars on all 25 levels. There's also a Hard Flight Mode that changes the controls to make them impossible AND 45% more realistic. (a little too difficult maybe?)\n\nCONS:\nv.v The game is a little ugly, and it's obviously not for everyone. Opinions WILL vary, and I've seen people call this game hidious, and I can see where they're coming from. Not much to this game... BESIDES THE PROS!\nv.v I sorta like it, and dislike the fact that you can go to ANY level you want.\n(Resist the temptation of going to the last few levels. This game gets good.)\nv.v You only get 3 stars for beating the best time? Why not 5? C'mon, make 2 stars the-easy-way & 5 stars 2 challenges drilled together.\n\nNow YOU rate this game.\n1 sterg = 0/10 dirt medel\n2 stars = noob's bronze medal\n3 stars = Silver Do-it-better Medal\n4 stars = Gold Honor\n5 STAR = Universal Recognition","January 19","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
