I streamed Hacknet for 5 hours the other night and we had a great time experiencing what the world had to offer. You would think I rocketed through the game faster, but honestly much of the time was spent messing around in servers and poking around. The intuitive gameplay, explorable content, and the way the game handles failure made for a really enjoyable experience.\n\nOne thing I enjoyed was how intiutive everything was. This isn't linux, this isn't MS-DOS, this isn't even hacking per se. It's an adventure game with a command line interface. Hacking concepts and tools are abstracted for playablilty though it should be noted that there are some real hacking suites out there that are scarily easier to use then what you find in the game.\n\nI'd love to go into details about the exciting things I found, but half of the fun is exploring. One big suggestion I have is to read through the help command in your OS - all 3 pages. Your HacknetOS has a lot of functionality that you wouldn't normally expect. The commands can also let you have a lot of fun! I had a ball changing some IRC logs and websites to include my viewers names to much embarassment and laughs.\n\nAn aspect I appreciated is that the punishment for making mistakes is firm but fair. Going into too much detail would be spoiling, but suffice it to say don't just get cozy clicking on the GUI for everything you do. Know your commands and they will treat you well in return.\n\nI did encounter a few minor bugs, some graphic glitches dealing with text, however none were game breaking and I documented this information back to the company. At the stage I'm at in the game there were no hardware upgrades, but I have uncovered a number of hacking tools to provide alternate forms of entry into more difficult servers.\n\nI'm happy to share more of my experience with you, or if you'd like just stop by the channel to see it in action.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I was provided a pre-relase copy of the game by Surprise Attack Games with no additional compensation or influence. Heck I like the game so much I'm picking up a copy to give away to my viewers. :)\n\n\nEDIT:  After a few more streams of the game, and now about 15 more hours spent with Hacknet I'm still loving the experience  The universe is solid, with some very interesting servers you encounter that make homages to pop culture and game references in some instances.  The banter logs are proabably my favorite things to hunt down as it makes it feel a little more real that people are using these boxes.\n\nAs for those miffed about me talking about my stream?  I respect your thumbs down, but potential buyers got to see Hacknet in action and it helped them make a purchasing decision (lots of YES!).  Totally worth it.","August 12, 2015","true","26.5"," 1,059 of 1,137 people (93%) found this review helpful 82 people found this review funny","93","059","1","82","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/365450/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","Hacknet is a hacking simulation game. You are probably familiar with other games of the same genre, such as Uplink and the Hacker Evolution series. This game is, I dare to say, better than both of those, despite having some bugs.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:Fourteen days after Agent Bit's disappearance, a failsafe sequence was activated. You are one of the only people who can solve Bit's death. As you get more and more involved into the hacker community, you start unveiling a mystery and it's up to you to discover what was really behind Bit and the security system he created.\n\nPros:    After the success of Uplink, there had to be a game sooner or later that would try to improve what Uplink started. Hacknet not only achieves that, but takes it to the next level. The story alone is amazing and makes sure that you're not just repeating the same commands and actions over and over but gives it a meaning.\nI have to say that the whole interface is working really nicely when it comes to clarity and effectiveness. You can do 90% of things both in the Display section and Terminal section, but they are both placed in the interface and I find it surprisingly effective. I use the Display section for figuring out what is going on and the Terminal section to execute commands.\nYou have a nice map on the bottom of the screen, that is showing all of the cyber locations you have visited already. As you get to connect to tons of computers, you would think that the map would be overcrowded, but this is not the case. I found the map really useful, despite it being almost completely covered.\nThere is no bouncing from servers as you remember from other hacking games. Instead, traces are lost if you simply disconnect. Even better is the way how the developers managed what happens if you get traced. Your computer (the virtual one, of course) activates a failsafe sequence. It tells you the IP of your ISP and your IP. You have to break into your ISP's server in a very limited amount of time and from there, reset your IP. This is a brilliant way to prevent accidental game overs and having to start all over again. Instead, you are provided with one more hard (and fun) challenge.\nI really enjoy the soundtrack in this game. The song was written by a guy who also made the soundtrack for Hotline Miami. The music matches with the tension of your current illegal doings and really makes your heart beat faster. Amazing job.\nThe in-game hacking is based on actual UNIX commands, which is pretty cool. Still, don't expect to be a pro hacker when you finish this game. You would still be a few steps away, the first step being stopping playing hacking simulators instead of learning the real deal.\nThere is a ton of Easter Eggs in this game. A clicker game, hidden Steam keys and a lot more. It's really impressive how they manage to fit all sorts of things into this game. Also, you should read all of the IRC chat logs when you encounter them. They can be super funny (and useful).\nI have cooperated with the developer in bug-related issues and I have to say that I really like the way that the developer interacts with the community. (Almost) all of the bugs I have encountered were fixed and I'm glad that they managed to bring the final release in a shape that they did.\nAnother interesting aspect of this game is puzzle solving. You have to think really hard to solve some of them and you even have to remember things from your previous missions, write things down and stuff like that.\nIf you don't like the user interface, you will encounter skins later in the game that you can download and make your virtual computer looks just the way you want.\nThe system requirements are low, which is great for old computers. However, there are some moments when FPS suddenly drops and gets to a normal level quickly.\n$/€10 is a steal for a game of such quality. If you ever enjoyed hacking games, this should be the top game on your wishlist.\nCons:    Bugs. Many were fixed, but some are still present. The game-breaking ones are gone, however, so you should be fine.\nThis game should have a button to reset progress. I wanted to do that a couple of times but you can't really do that without browsing through folders and files.\nThe final verdict:As a big fan of hacking games, I was very happy to be able to play Hacknet. The game is certainly made well and definitely recommend this game to you if you enjoy hacking games as well. The story is surprisingly good and adds an important part to the whole experience. The hacking really feels real and, even though that the commands are pretty much the same through the whole game, never feel repetitive.\nThis is, no doubt, the best hacking game ever released. Get it, and fast!\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.","August 14, 2015","true","8.4"," 331 of 356 people (93%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","93","331","356","17","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doodledibob/recommended/365450/","doodledibob","Doodledibob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doodledibob/","119 products in account","Hacknet is an absolute gem of a game.\n\nTLDR: While people already familiar with using *nix or general programing principles may find this game not too deep or challenging, it offers a well thought out narrative, with fun game mechanics and excels at teaching you about computer essentials without you even realizing it.\n\n\nMore thoughts:\n\nWhile this game isn't perfect, I would still reccomend it to anyone who has even a remote interest in computers. Even if you only want to feel like a hacker in a movie, that game gives you that feeling. If you want to learn more about the general concepts of computer-, program-, and network-architecture, this game is a great launching-point, before you start reading more "serious" or conventional literature on the subject.\n\nNow, the mechanics are pretty straight-forward. You gain various programs through completing quests, which, in turn, can be used to bypass more complex security. You also gain the ability to run commands through other computers, allowing you, for example, to pretty much emulate a DDOS attack. Timing is also important, so be ready to type "dc" + [enter] if you're being tracked. AAAAAAAAANNNNNNDDDDDD............\n\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\nthat's pretty much it when it comes to mechanics. The rest is working your way through systems full of mostly text-files, a lot of them taken from bash.org (hilarious quotes from internet chats, NSFW, but great!), and a lot of fun easter-eggs for nerds and fans of "hacker-culture" as it has been created by Hollywood. There even are multiple references to the movie "Hackers", a must see in my opinion. ;)\n\nNow, the mechanics got old after not too long (a good 8 hours), mainly due to you unlocking a lot of the tools that you need pretty quickly. I'll talk more about overall gameplay features in just a moment.\n\nThe narrative is fun, well paced, and interwoven well with the gameplay mechanics. I won't spoil anything, just watch the trailer and you get the general premise.\n\nThe overall game is simplified, to allow people without prior experience to enjoy it, but encourages experimentation and exploration of what you can do, giving you plenty of examples and hints along the way to teach you, without you even realizing it, a lot about how your system works. Absolutely amazing!\n\nConcerning the lack of gameplay features, the dev is amazing. Yup, one dev. And he's already said that he wants to implement multiplayer. If that happens, this will become one of the best games out there. Period. Plus he wants to continue to push content for the game. Not to mention, that the community as a whole is awesome and really suportive for newcomers.\n\nIn its current state, it's well worth the price its asking for. As the dev continues to push more content, the game will continue to expand and improve.\n\nPlease support this game, as its honestly trying to be different and fun, without a lot of the backstabbing and abusive tactics emplyed by all too many triple AAA studios/publishers. I can guarantee, you'll have a blast playing this!\n\nEdit 2016: what I've said before still applies. I would just like to point towards the roadmap the dev has for 2016, which includes multiplayer and steam-workshop integration for custom missions throughout various points this year. http://steamcommunity.com/games/365450/announcements/detail/955130645658936382\n\n****DISCLAIMER:****\nWIll not actually refund any purchases if you are somehow not pleased with the overall game.\nMouse and Mechanical Keyboard sold seperatly.\nBatteries not included.","October 20, 2015","true","14.8"," 165 of 176 people (94%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","94","165","176","38","8"

A very cult genre I think with very few games making a significant mark. I cannot claim to have played that classic so I will have to describe this entertaining game called Hacknet without any past comparisons. I will say that the reason it is compared though is because it takes the hacking seriously and isn't just some casual hacking game for the masses.\n\nHacknet has almost no graphics (Maybe about 5 image files in the entire game), it has no video. It is only you looking at a computer screen full of numbers and files. You are a hacker, not Rambo, or James Bond, or Batman. You don't shoot at criminals and punch clowns in the face to save the day. You are a hacker that has found yourself in the middle of some hacking factions that may have stumbled into something big. You get some simple clues at the start that something is going on, but as you delve deeper into the hacking world, get recruited by more skillful hacking groups, and find more mysterious actions going on in your hacking exploits you will get asked to help find out what happened to a popular hacker that has gone missing. Just like everything in the hacking community, all useful information is hidden on systems which need to be hacked into. While looking for that information you will uncover many more secrets as you figure out exactly what happened. A final ending that could be considered a "shock". Very intriguing storyline and way to tell a story all through computer documents, e-mails, IRC chats, etc.\n\nWhile the tutorials, and the game itself is friendly to those who have no experience entering command lines, or hacking at all, it may not exactly be for the most casual of gamers. If you are a VERY slow typist you may have some issues when it comes to hacking into computers here in the time frames that are allowed. They have made it easier for you by allowing you to hit "TAB" in certain places to have the game auto-complete command lines if there is nothing else that has the exact same characters and you are in the proper place to do so, however. It absolutely helps to have some typing speed, or at least the knowledge of where all the keys on the keyboard are without having to search them out all the time though. You will have issues if you are THAT slow.\n\nYou are tasked with finding various tools to run .exe files allowing you to open up ports on the computers you hack before running a PortHack program to get access to its files. Some computers early on are very easy to hack with only having to open 1-2 ports, but as you find more tools you may have to open as many as 5 ports, break through a firewall, and get through a proxy all on the same PC while avoiding a tracer too! So it becomes a bit quicker later on where you must know the commands and how to crack the security of various systems as the game progresses while fighting a clock too. You should pick up these skills as you play, but the knowledge of how to access certain databases will require a bit more thought at times. This is where the game adds a bit of strategy and puzzling into the mix. You need to think about what you are trying to do, search through maybe several other computers not just tools, but possibly passwords to OTHER computers, and even find ways to crack encrypted files! So it isn't always completely straightforward with the game holding your hand to get what you need. You will absolutely need to think somewhat critically here to reach your goals. IT is very refreshing to find a game that doesn't just offer you solutions on a silver platter and challenges you to figure things out yourself. It is quite rewarding in some cases to find a solution after thinking all your options through. Sometimes you can even find solutions to future problems by just HACKING into things you aren't even supposed to be working on for no other reason than because you felt like it.\n\nHacknet had a few bugs when I got it at release, but it appears that most have been taken care of. I finished the game, but I had a quest that didn't trigger properly so I had to hack my way around into other things to find the info I needed to proceed. Something that really wasn't that big a deal because it felt like I was actually doing something I figured out myself to get around a problem. The triggers have been patched now though as far as I know. Other than that nothing I ran into.\n\nHacknet does make you feel like a hacker if you have never done any hacking before in your life. It does use real world terminology and command lines to satisfy those that have in the past too so it isn't just for the hacker n00bs out there. The fast paced and tech-y music playing in the background was designed to make you feel like you are hacking systems as a hero in a movie. Punching in commands as fast you can can before getting caught is definitely helped by the pace of the music playing while you are trying to look into the dirty secrets of every computer you hack into.\n\nI found Hacknet to be a fantastic feeling of hacking and mystery solving. While you may feel that the middle gets a little bit repetitive when it comes to the hacking, it does usually change up enough in what you need to use to keep the pacing OK. Usually what you find in the files, and of course the ending was payoff enough to continue through if you start to feel like you are staring at a flashing screen too long. I absolutely would not recommend this game to a casual gamer at all. Unlike say a point and click adventure, the puzzles you solve here will require quick thinking and quick fingers at times. Most players will be fine with this, but this is a game that require MUCH more activity on the keyboard than it does with a mouse. So you are typing commands for what you need to do in, and not using a mouse to solve puzzles as much. If you don't read the help files, the tutorial, and look at the academic databases in the game you will not be able to figure things out. If you want a brainless game this one is not for you.\n\nThe game has trading cards of course and Steam Achievements, which should be fairly easy to 100% if you can get through the game. This game should take you anywhere from 5-10 hours. More if you look ar ound some and find every secret I suspect.\n\nNOTE: Something I didn't talk about, because I am unsure what it consists of, is that Hacknet will be releasing a patch at some point that includes not just Steam Workshop to add more player made "questing", but it will also have Multiplayer! Like I said I don't know much about those aspects, but they are definitely coming. MP was in the game before Steam so it already exists, but the developers didn't feel it was working well enough yet to release with the Steam release. They wanted to stamp out any single player bugs first before bringing in these other features.","August 24, 2015","true","21.5"," 75 of 77 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","75","77","5","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Expack/recommended/365450/","Expack","76561198018245183","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Expack/","170 products in account","DISCLAIMER: I was provided a press review copy for the purposes of documenting the game for PCGamingWiki, a publicly-editable technical wiki for games.\n\nWhat would happen if you gamified the idea that you found a copy of an OS which was so dead-simple to use, anyone with basic computer and investigative skills could hack into anything? You'd get Hacknet, an excellent hacking game designed to be the spiritual successor to Uplink. Slick graphics, a sliding difficulty designed to get you introduced to the game's mechancis one-by-one, and an in-the-background story which is surprisingly pointient and explores not only how insecure computers really are to a dedicated hacker, but the ramifications, both practical and mornal, of an OS designed to hack anything.\n\nTL;DR: It's a short, satisfying hacking game which, despite how complicated it seems at the outset, eases you into its mechanics, world, and story, and gives you the surprising, satisfying feeling of being both a master hacker and Sherlock Holmes at the same time.\n\nIs this Uplink 2.0?For the mandatory "Is this Uplink 2.0" part of the review: no. This is not the spiritual successor hardcore fans of Uplink have been looking for because:\nYou use a 'real' computer with fixed specs, with HacknetOS running on top of it as a VM (Virtual Machine).\nThe game is command-line based with some GUI helpers, such as an IP map, optional GUI-based system navigation, and a note app.\nYou can only run computer-compromising apps via command-line.\nThe game's story, despite being subtle, in the background, and without limitations (i.e. x number of connections before game over), drives the game, and your actions are ultimately in service of the story.\nIf none of the above scared you off, then read on because this spiritual sequel is, in spite of the above, a worthy one IMO...\nGameplayAs mentioned above, Hacknet uses its command-line for much of the hacking, with a few GUI helpers for those tasks too cumbersome to exclusively do in the GUI, like keeping track of all the known IPs and keeping notes. Despite this, there are only a few core commands, and are remarkably easy-to-remember with repeated use - and the game is very careful to ensure you do - and often relate to what they do. For example, to crack an in-game computer's SSH port, run SSHcrack [insert port number here]. This is further helped by the addition of command auto-completion - something the game teaches you how to use very quickly. So, that SSHcrack command I just mentioned? All you really need to type in is SSH, press the TAB key, add the port number, and press the Enter key. Believe me - it makes your life a lot easier.\n\nThe hacking itself is simple: connect to the target, probe the computer for weaknesses, then execute programs to exploit their weaknesses. Some computers require some preperatory work, such as computers with proxies effectively require you to use other computers you've compromised to attack them, while others might require you to find a piece of cracking software to open them up, bypass a firewall by running special software to solve its encryption, and so on. At first, it isn't so difficult - just run the apps, and watch the magic happen. Later on, you'll begin to regularly encounter computers which will attempt to passively hunt your computer down and force it to reboot - complete with a giant timer showing you the exact time to failure - requiring you to run multiple apps at once. Since your computer only has so much memory, you'll need to play Tetris with the apps, shutting down those you don't need and running the ones which bypass the easiest weaknessess. Beating the clock and compromising a computer with a second to spare is an accomplishment in an of itself which never gets old.\n\nAnother good thing is the game understands how counter-intuitive command-line use is for the average user, so through the use of an initial tutorial (which can be skipped once you know how to terminate it) and missions which slowly slide up in difficulty as they teach the basic mechanics, you'll eventually come to grips with the commands you need to hack. And once you do, it starts giving you missions which, combined with the clear, clever visuals (more on those later), allow you to feel like a master hacker in a way different from other hacking games because you'll often need to do something which most hacking games leave out entirely or towards the very end.\n\nYou get to be Sherlock Holmes.\n\nYou see, because people, even those with good security sense, tend to forget or excuse security issues, they also tend to leave stuff on their computers, mobile devices, and e-mail accounts. IP addresses to secret files, administrator (admin) passwords for top-secret servers and their most private e-mails - you name it, they'll leave it. As such, any good hacker needs to dig through files to find all those details so they can find what they need with the least amount of effort - allowing you to find hidden servers, open files which would otherwise be closed to you, and skip dangerous, time-consuming, and sometimes impossible system hacks by simply logging in as the administrator. You'll be surprised how satisfied you'll feel following a trail of clues to your ultimate objective, making an impossible task suddenly seem trivial - and end up finding some hilarious stuff in the process as you dig through all the files which don't matter.\n\nAll that said, there are some things which make the game easier than it should be. A key part of the gameplay is erasing anything in the system's logs indicating you were there so the authorities can't track your hacks back to you. In theory, this means deleting every log file before leaving the server; in practice, all you have to do in most cases is start deleting all the log files, disconnect from the server, wait for all the files to be deleted, then come back. "How can I delete files from a computer I just disconnected from?" you ask. You shouldn't, but the game lets you. This means that as long as the computer doesn't have a rotating admin password - and most don't - what should be down-to-the-wire hacks end up being trivial. Furthermore, any future accessing of the computer will be ignored - even if you never delete the logs after the first time.\n\nOddly enough, that one problem with the gameplay is...actually a bonus in my eyes, since it enables you to focus more on solving the challenging Sherlock Holmes-esque puzzles.\nStoryI can't really touch on the story much as to do so would ruin the surprise and horror it provides late in the game. I can say, though, that the story, while simple, is quite sophisticated, as it explores through your actions just what kind of power HacknetOS gives those who own it in today's digital age, where everything - and I do mean everything - is connected to the Internet and, thus, can be compromised, pried open, and tampered with.\nGraphicsThe graphics in Hacknet are very minimalistic and clean, meaning you can see exactly what's what with minimal effort. There are also some optional, subtle effects which emulate a CRT computer monitor, adding to the realism. The standout graphics come from the apps, as they show you in fun and clever ways how they're progressing, whether it shows you punching through an SSH table with every section hacked turned green or beat out an SMTP mail server's sorting algorithm to force it to shut down and open up to you.\nAdditional ThoughtsI really wish the game opened up towards the middle - it would've been fun exploring the world wide web, finding hidden sub-plots as you tear through the world's computers like tissue paper, as a reprieve from the short story. Speaking of the story, I also wish it were longer - the game's puzzles were clever and unique, and I so desperately wanted more content.","August 12, 2015","true","12.1"," 110 of 133 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","110","133","6","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/0x80/recommended/365450/","0x80","0x80","http://steamcommunity.com/id/0x80/","107 products in account","While this game is being sold as a "hacking simulator", a debate will likely rage about what exactly it simulates. In either case, it comes suspiciously close to being a realistic simulation of hacking. So close, in fact, I'm left wondering why the dev didn't go the extra yards to make it inarguably so (maybe something he can shoot for in the future). Realism nit-picking aside, this game is full of very realistic nods to hacker and IRC culture, and in broad strokes, represents some of what goes on in actual exploits. While the experience of compromising systems is streamlined for the sake of keeping it an actual game (again, is it a puzzle game or a simulator?), in that "push a button, get bacon" sort of way you see in "hacker" movies, there was still much in the game that reminded me of taking the OSCP (for those who know my pain, you will find much in each mission to make you smile in that corpse-like rictus you had while laughing at emails and files during enumeration pratice in the Offsec lab).\n\nAfter a while, I realized I was playing not so much because of the faux-hacking experience, but because there was a rather compelling story unfolding. Can't pick that apart without spoiling it, so I'll critique the gameplay instead (positives first):\n\nPros:\nThis game is hilarious in a sick, twisted way. References to chan and IRC culture litter the storyline. While the majority of gameplay involves limited exploit combinations, there are moments where you don't know what the f**k is going on, and you have to think fast to avert a crisis. If you're into security culture, you'll find your intuition meshes well with the challenges, and you can improv what to do most of the time. It's like a Drunk History version of real hacking, so it's probably an ideal game to play while you're drunk.\n\nPeople with zero knowledge of hacker culture or basic unix commands and quad notation will walk away familiar with all of the above.\n\nThe game is cheap, so whether you enjoy the simplistic, repetitive nature of the "hacking" it simulates, you won't regret the purchase, because it will entertain you regardless. The story itself is worth the price, and the way the story is told using the genre is clever.\n\nIf you liked TIS-100 (and I'm a recovering TIS-addict) you'll appreciate this for some of the same reasons, but the games aren't identical by a long shot. In fact, that would be the one constructive criticism I'd like both devs of these two games to hear: if TIS-100 had the narrative of Hacknet, and Hacknet had the coding fatures and complexity of TIS-100, you'd have a seriously ground breaking game on your hands, guys.\n\nMaybe the two of you should consider a collab or something...\n\nCons:\n\nPushing buttons to get bacon gets fairly boring after a while, and the game loses some of its puzzle quality attributes as a result of the limited attack combinations, and the lack of customization or tweaking of exploits and tactics that is the real joy of hacking. If this was never going to be a hacking game, and more of a puzzle game, I wanted to see a complexity progression throughout, instead of a chaotic difficulty plataeu.\n\nAlso, why write so many missions for lelzsec, but make it so easy to permanently lose your chance to access them -- it was like a quarter of the game just gets skipped automagically because there isn't a clear choice presented to the player that an alternate path exists!\n\nEach mission certainly could have involved more manual hacks to achieve both realism and puzzle difficulty, but this would require adding more OS commands to the game, or a limited scripting engine of some sort. It couldn't have been that hard to add a mission where the solution was to exploit weak service permissions, tampering with programs launched by the OS at boot. Perhaps telling the print spooler to reset the system's admin password by re-writing it to launch a file with a "passwd" command in it, or to add a user account with "admin" privileges, something along these lines. A phishing mission, or getting a target to open an email and trigger a malicious trojan embedded in a PDF file would have been fun. These kinds of scenarios would require no "hacking tools", and might actually require the player to struggle. I'd rather struggle than push "exploit" over and over, my only real enemy being the trace timer.\n\nTo do this would require more system commands like "touch", privileges to edit, the ability to create files, maybe a basic word processor and the ability to write emails (instead of just reply... to some of them). All we had to work with were pre-existing files, a "replace" command that replaces lines and is too cumbersome, and no manner of scripting available. No complex chains of commands, no writing or editing code beyond some HTML (so I can change "chicken" to "c**ks", but that's not really hacking as much as being a d**k).\n\nOnce you get to that long slog of a valley mid-game, it stops feeling like hacking AND puzzle solving, and starts to feel more like grinding mobs in an MMO to get to the next bit of storyline. Each player will have more or less patience for that experience. Exploit tactics become routine too quickly, and the difficulty drops off.\n\nOVERALL:\nShort game. In 20 hours you can play through twice and get all the achievements, and you compulsively will, despite the bugs that might force you to start a new game because something is glitched and can't recover [though the developer is working hard to patch all these, props to him]. There are enough Easter Eggs and humorous logs to make you anxious that you missed some the first time. More like an interactive novel for hackers than a puzzle game or simulator, but with elements of both; you will feel haunted putting together what your *actual* role in the missions might have been, and to what extent the Ayy Lmaos were involved.\n\nFor $8-ish, I felt like I got more than I paid for and told my friends to play it for the lulz.","August 16, 2015","true","28.4"," 53 of 54 people (98%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","98","53","54","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/365450/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3204 products in account","So I heard you like command line interfaces...\nHacknet takes cues from a mix of places, primarily Hacker Evolution and Uplink, creating a blend that can safely be summed up as a hacking puzzle sim. Your job is to utilise the tools you acquire to probe and gain access to a selection of progressively trickier systems and networks, and unravel the story of a hacker who recently deceased in a supposed accident. Initially you're given control of HackNet, a revolutionary OS that makes you essentially invincible from traditional tracing methods, and a few basic tools, from there your job is to gather the resources you'll need to piece together the mystery of what happened.\n\nA lot closer to the real thing than I expected...\nHacknet hews a lot closer to the real nature of exploiting individual ports (even if the programs are automated and require little work to figure out the relevant exploits), and you'll be picking apart servers step by step, usually using command line textual input which makes the game "feel" an awful lot more real than say, Uplink (though uplink succeeded much more from a neuromancer perspective). You'll be learning the concept of using shells to overwhelm proxies, cyclical analysis and syndication to deal with firewalls, and the use of various tools to pry open specific ports to eventually use your swiss army knife tool "PortHack" which will then turn over Admin control of a system to you. Then you get to explore, and use various commands to remove evidence of your tomfoolery.\n\nOh Bash, you wonderful meme generator...\nThe game is LOADED with internet culture references, the devs made liberal use of bash.org for IRC logs which litter the servers, taking a "best of" the IRC culture and invariably having some real funnies tucked away on the servers for you to discover, along with various text files with references to games and other internet geekery. There's a lot that's relevant and interesting, and you'll no doubt enjoy what you find as you explore the various servers. There's also hidden paths, servers lying out of the way, and secret side dishes for those willing to investigate and probe various elements of the games rather cavernous depths.\n\nA stylish presentation\nThe game is presented in a very slick x-term package, anyone who's used X11 interfaces in Linux will be very much at home here, and more entertainingly, there's the ability to replace your xterm with ones you find, changing up your wallpaper and colour scheme as you progress through the game. The music too, is very well thought out, and very appropriate, with music that's contextual to various events kicking in and ensuring that you get pumped up at just the right times. Even the HackNet OS boot sequence is pleasingly authentic, right down to little details such as memory allocations and devices and the like.\n\nClosing thoughts\nThe one big criticism is that this game is hand crafted, this is both a strength AND a weakness, because unlike Uplink, once you've finished the game and plumbed out all the secrets, there isn't much more to come back to. However, what there IS that's here, and there's a good 6-8 hours, is stylish, well written, and very nicely presented. Not to mention a great callback to -good- hacking games, which is something that's been sorely missing as of late.\n\nVerdict : Highly recommended","August 17, 2015","true","21.9"," 73 of 84 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","73","84","4","3"

Check below.\n\nAn interesting mix between Uplink and Street Hacker, for the price of ~10 USD is definitely worth checking out.\n\nThe game is pretty fun, some things require attention to detail and logical thinking, and the humor is pretty good!\n\nHowever, the game launched with a very bad bug which might make your save useless: if you try to make two missions at a time, you won't be able to complete the first one. This can simply kill your save.\nAlso, even though the presentation is well done and the interface looks pretty, I don't see much advance over what other Hacking games did before (Uplink was released in 2001), so you really should approach this with caution. The biggest difference here is being able to use both a GUI and a Console - which is good news.\n\nThis doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the game, of course. But it does dissapoint if you expected anything more than that.\n\nI haven't finished the game yet, due to the bug that probably broke my savegame. But about the plot: it's decently intriguing and will make you want to uncover all the secrets, as a hacking game should.\n\nSo even though I ended up pretty disappointed - it's 2015, yet there's little news here. Even Street Hacker, which is a decade old and terribly programmed, had deeper features; and Uplink had a more compelling gameplay and story - there's still some fun to be had and some jokes/moments actually made me laugh or smile.\nI do recommend waiting for a patch before playing it, though. So rush it on your own risk. :)\n\nThanks for reading!\n-----\n\nUPDATE: As of 16 of August, there has been an update to try and fix some issues. I made a new save and it broke itself again - the game forced me to have two missions at a time, making the first one unable to be complete, which would make it impossible to finish the game.\nThis release was a REAL mess, and it annoys me that some people are defending the game blindly. After two playthroughs, I was unable to finish it. So please, start taking notes of the facts.\n\nTherefore, I must say that you shouldn't buy this unless you're a fan of the genre - unless all of the gamebreaking and save-corrupting bugs are fixed.\nFor reference, I'm 98% on the way to giving this a rewrite with a thumbs down.","August 15, 2015","true","10.7"," 59 of 66 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","59","66","0","6"

It is basically a much better version of Uplink.\nNow, is it realistic from a hacking point of view? No. But that's a good thing, because realistic hacking scenarios would be pretty boring for a game. The concepts are taken from the real world and simplified/modified to make an interesting game.\n\nIt is simple at first and doesn't get too difficult while still providing some challenges and a nice storyline.\n\nThat being said, while the game could be a 9/10, game-breaking bugs currently make it at most a 4/10.\n\nHere are some that I've encountered so far:\n- You are able to take multiple contracts at some point, but doing so will prevent further progression due to the quest completion system being bugged.\n- Using multiple profiles is inconsistent, you can't be sure that your savegame remains the way it was\n- Game supports windowed mode but crashes regularly if you focus on another window\n- Loss of all savegames - this is a big one. The last time the aforementioned crash occured, I've lost all of my saves.\n\nThe last bug on this list is the main reason this review has come to a not recommended conclusion and the others severely contributed.\nIf any beta testing would've been done, such a list of game-breaking bugs wouldn't exist.\n\nUpdate 1: After the most recent patch promised a solution  to "many issues that were causing people to lose save files" I've decided to start a new profile. Did some work, saved session and exited the game normally. And alas, as I started the game again today there were no accounts and my save_accountsMeta.xml was gone. Again. This is clearly getting ridiculous and I wouldn't expect a solution any time soon, the dev will probably need a few weeks to figure out the issues with Steam API/Cloud saves etc.\n\nUpdate 2: Since apparently fixing the savegame issues within a reasonable amount of time isn't happening, I have to say this is close to false advertising. The game should be tagged early access if the amount of issues is still that extensive after two patches. This is the sort of behaviour I'd expect from large companies that simply don't give a sh*t anymore, not form an indie dev trying to make his name. I hope the dev learns some things from this failed release, one of them being that you shouldn't release a game full of bugs when you're too busy being at conventions after the release and don't have time to fix the issues.\n\nDon't get me wrong: everyone makes mistakes and stuff like that can happen. But that doesn't change the fact that as a customer I kinda feel cheated, since there's a reason I don't buy early access and this time the product isn't of higher quality.\nAgain, once the major bugs are fixed and solutions for the existing issues are presented, I'll gladly give this game a recommendation.","August 14, 2015","false","12.9"," 158 of 265 people (60%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","60","158","265","9","13"

I like most everything about it. However, I just can't recommend it in it's current state. That being said, don't pass on this game completely! Once it updates and the bugs are fixed the game will be worth the full price easily.\n\nAs I write this, I have two seperate games that I have played that are frozen where they are in the storyline due to bugs. I can't go any further.\n\nThe major bug that plagues players right now is that you cannot accept any "jobs" while you have one active. The game will let you do so, but when you do it will render all previously accepted missions impossible to complete. One my first playthrough, I was not aware of this and got hours in before I encountered the bug. Second playthrough I was being careful- only sought out one mission at a time. The bug got me when I overlooked an email and took on another quest. That email that I overlooked was the main storyline calling, and because I didn't immediately perform it, I couldn't complete the mission. Game two over.\n\nI hate to say this, but I just cant recommend it at this time. There are other issues involving savegame corruption as well. I look forward to the developer (who is highly active and responisve) fixing these problems and I will update my review to recommend at that time. Until then, I would pass on a purchase but put it on your wishlist for later.\n\nUPDATE- The dev replied to this review directly, which you can see in the comments of this review. That speaks volumes to me that this is a good dev that cares about this game- the kind of dev that I feel that we (the Steam community) need to support. I anticipate changing this review from negative to positive soon.","August 14, 2015","false","23.5"," 33 of 46 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","33","46","2","2"

What I did play was the HackRUN saga, so please pardon my comparison to a not very similar game. I also think it's funny that there are .dll and .exe file on what is (seemingly) a Linux system, but I can ignore that.\n\nIn a nutshell, Hacknet is a hacking sim game with a decent storyline. That is something I don't see often. HackRUN also has a storyline, but it's pretty linear if you ask me. This game uses real UNIX commands. For those of you new to the coding world (I guess?), it won't be hard to pick up; the tutorial does a good job of introducing the commands, and the 'help' menu will always be there to help you. For those of you who are familiar with the UNIX command prompt, you will be pleasantly surprised. The animations you get when hacking is pretty cool too. The best part of this games\ is that there are some systems that will start tracing you once you start your hacks. You have 100 seconds to do whatever you need to do and GTFO the system, or else (I don't actually know what happens because I have never failed doing so). You can, disconnect midway to cut the trace short and come back in the system again to do your stuff (again) at a later time, but hey, where's the fun in that? Along the way of making yourself a name in the hacking world (in the game), you will encounter files that are seemingly unimportant (like IRC log files, random text files, etc.). You are half right, most of these files are unimportant. They may contain jokes and the stupidity of internet friends chatting together; but the rest may contain passwords that will make your life much easier when attempting to access some systems or useful information on your target's location.\n\nThere are decent puzzles in this game that happens in a specific scenario, but the contracts you get are pretty repetitive: probe the system, bypass proxy/firewall if those are there, open some ports, hack in, do your stuff, clear logs, get out. New commands are introduced every now and then, but those have instructions along with them, so it's pretty easy to do whatever you need to do after. Basically, it's not very challenging (unless the devs add a "No x-server" mode to force you to use the command prompt throughout the game, that would be really fun, devs pls read). The last thing that this game lacks is the ability to adjust the SFX volume. Me clicking things actually shocks me sometimes because trust me, the SFXs are loud.\n\nIn conclusion, Hacknet is a good hacking sim with a decent storyline and a bit of realism. Would I recommend? Yes. Would I play again? Yes.\n\nIf you reach this point, thank you for raking your time to read the massive wall of text that my review is (lol).","May 5","true","4.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

Only actualy capable of using a computer.\n\nThe game starts you off with a straight-forward set of tools, which rapidly expands to meet the various challenges you meet.  By the end, I was utterly enthralled by and immersed in the game.\n\nIt's more story based than the obvious comparison, Uplink, so you do less in the way of freelance hacking.  It would have been nice to have the option to be slightly more mercenary, but the story blossoms as you approach the climax of the game - motivating you emotionaly as well as intellectualy to see the game through.\n\nWhat's more, there are lots of little easter eggs you can find, people's activities you can track and secret activies to uncover - if you know your way around the computer languages the game is built around I have no doubt that there are even more possibilities.  I haven't, but I didn't feel that I was missing anything.\n\nI would seriously reccomend givng this game a go, its been a while since I've played a game that made me feel genuinely clever - neither led-by-the-hand nor over-faced by its challenges.\n\nA very neat trick indeed.","August 17, 2015","true","11.8"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

Back in school I was bad at languages and good at science, maths and creative stuff so I blame my sucky coding skills on this.\n\nI have however always been a fan of hacking games such as the Uplink and Hacker Evolution series but they have always felt more like hacking from the movie hackers rather than what actual hacking might be like. Hacknet is much closer to what I imagine it is like and I really enjoyed the time I spent with it. The game was easy to get into and moves at a decent pace with an intuitive difficulty curve that meant I never felt I knew exactly what to do but equally never floundered and got stuck.\n\nAs far as I understand this isn’t really an accurate sim of any kind of software it is instead an adventure game with a DOS style command line interface. There are some graphical elements to help things along but the game, at least to an outsider, feels very real.\n\nThere were a few times that I got stuck but this was nothing that a few moments checking the help page did not fix. If anything one of the things I feel could have really benefitted this game would be multi-monitor support. It was really annoying to have to flick between windows as opposed to having multiple windows open at the same time.\n\nThe game is relatively difficult but not unfair but I think someone with a better knowledge of command line interfaces might have found it easier.\n\nAs you progress through the game you begin to understand more about the world you live in as the story evolves in front of you. There are a fair amount of pop culture references that always raise a smile.\n\nOverall Hack Net is well worth playing to anyone who watched hackers or Jurassic Park and wanted to feel like they were ♥♥♥♥ hot at computering.\n\nIf you have enjoyed this review and found it informative please join our Curator group to get more recommendations http://steamcommunity.com/groups/gametutor#curation","August 13, 2015","true","12.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","1"

I wouldn't go as far as to compare it to either Uplink or the Street Hacker series simply because it feels more like a demo when compared to them. The execution and gameplay is shallow and naive. It's plagued by many basic design issues and most of the missions are just boring, repetitive, and feel more like a chore rather than a challenge.\n\nMy biggest gripes are:\n-boring, repetitive and easy missions. Only 2 interesting missions stand out, the final Bit one, and the online pacemaker one.\n-no sense of urgency or challenge. If you get caught hacking, that's just a reload to last checkpoint. No point in deleting any logs the way Uplink makes sure that you do. Uplink kept you on your toes because getting caught meant absolute game over!\n-Badly designed UI. The workstation "map" is a cluttered mess especially as you move closer towards the end. Nodes are being randomly generated and the ones closest to the edge of the screen have their hover information cut off. How that ever went past the testers, I do not know!\n-Weird writing, bad grammar, spelling mistakes, juvenile jokes scattered here and there. The ending was incredibly cheesy and anti-climactic.\n\nNot a bad game to get on sale. But this is no Uplink for sure. The tagline shouldn't be "if you liked Uplink, you'll love this!"

The Game Hacknet know from the version back in\n2012 has found it´s way to steam. i played it mayself back in 2012 and it was totally Awesome even without it´s new animations!\nThe games gives you the realistic feeling of Hacking and breaking into security systems. while\ninvestigateing the case of Bit who is a Hacker that died, you will get exploits like SSHcrack. the more objectives you complete the more harder it will be to hack computers. At the moment there\nare some small problems that don´t matter and there is no Multiplayermode yet, but it is really cool\nto play. The Multiplayermode is still in developement so we all have to wait for it.\n\nPro:\n-not expensive (costs like 10 € or 10 $ )\n-very nice soundtrack\n-challengeing Hacks to perform\n-massive amount of easter eggs hidden in IRC logs.\n-runs even on the worst hardware setup\n-interresting storyline\n-cool steam backgrounds from the Hacknet Badges\n\nCon:\n-i found some grammatic errors, some letters were missing.\n-not for people who aren´t able to read or speak english.\n-you can´t delet the Hacknet user accounts yet, so write down your passwords (ingame accounts, you´ll keep that game)\n\nmy final result is: I can totally recommed to buy the game! it´s just 10€ and thats a really fair priceing.it also makes fun to play it over and over.\nit also is good for people that try to improve theire english skill by challengeing themselfs.\n\ninfo Update 02/15/2016 -------------------------------------------------\nToday some things were announced for Hacknet._\n\n>Planned Stuff:\n\n-Translation to diffrent languages\n-Mod Support\n-DLC whit more Hacks and servers\n-Multiplayer\n\n>so you see it´s totally worth of buying it!","November 12, 2015","true","57.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

Even though you might think you'd lose interest because it gets repetitive (and it does do so from time to time) it's still great fun and an immersive experience especially considering its price. The brilliant music makes the game that much better and gets you really immersed into the gameplay. The "main story" is a bit absent through the game, but everything else makes up for it! I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to feel like a hacker!","September 18, 2015","true","5.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

You use a series of commands to "hack" into terminals both as a contract hacker and on a mission, one to find the reason for a fellow hacker's untimely death.\n\nIt's in large part due to its phenomenal soundtrack and well-realised interface, but no game this year has made me feel like more of a badass than Hacknet. Its presentation is executed so well that every action you take feels like you've been doing them for years, like hacking into networks is just child's play.\n\nIt plays very much like a puzzle-adventure game, so if something like that is up your alley, it's really worth checking out.\n\nAlso, it's worth playing to see the final hacking sequence alone.","September 19, 2015","true","6.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

There's so much detail put into this game and it ends up becoming extremely challenging. There's a lot of learning to do in terms of what programs you need to utilize in different situations and generally how to use the interface (especially if you're not too amazingly tech-savvy). I, myself, don't consider myself anywhere near a technological expert, but I was still very easily able to get the hang of it largely due to the intricate way the game was structured and paced. There were so many things that were beautiful about this game, and I admittedly got addicted to this game. It'll probably be a game that I'll often pick back up and play over and over again in the future, and I certainly don't have any complaints in that regard. It may be off limits to people who are easily confused or who tend to give up on things quickly once they become overwhelmed with new information, but otherwise, this game is easily worth over $40. It's $10. Just ♥♥♥♥ing get it.","October 18, 2015","true","11.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

So recommend everyone remotely interested in\nreal life hacking to give it a look. It's well worth your attention.\n\nAlthough, I'm not quite sure if it was worth all the time I put into it. (-Clock.exe-)\nThe storyline is nothing groundbreaking and the writing tends to be dodgy at times. But what really made me stop playing for a while before I finished it: The missions get really repetitive. Mostly, because the different .exe exploits/scripts/hacks don't differ mechanically. It's just type whichever you see fit and wait for it to finish. Which is in my opinion the games biggest flaw. (I'm not sure I'm missing the point because it's supposed to reallistic, but after all, this is a game.)\n\nWhich is truly a shame, because these last few missions are really fun.\nSo if you can keep up the grind, go get and finish this.\n\nOh, and, I really wish to see a "Hacknet 2".","February 20","true","54.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

And I can assure you: It's finally here! :)\nAlthough I wish it was a bit more true to the unix/linux commands, it's nothing gamebreaking. You probably won't even notice it if you've been running Win all your life. But come on.. mk, mkdir, cp, and nano or vi? And referring to root from sub-folder doesn't work.\nBut other than those rather minor issues, it's just what I've dreamed of.\n\nI got tracked by a hacker quite early in game, by less then a second margin. I panicked, and rebooted. When my client booted up, several errors appeared. And I realized that he had deleted one or more system files...\n\nDaaaaaamnit, i thought and waited for "Game Over" to appear. But to my surprise, It just stopped in shell. It never started X(GUI), but that was it. So, in pure shell(only text), I navigated to my logs to find out what happened.\nAnd true enough: only X was missing.\n\nSo I figured: "Well, shít.. I haven't taken any backup.. But wait! Maybe I can steal the config form another system?"\nAnd after a minute of navigating to another system, hacking it, copying the missing file and rebooting: Voilà! Different layout and theme, but it worked!\n\nI absolutely LOVE this way of punishing failure.\nThis feeling of rising like a phoenix, up from apparent "death", is one of the best I've had in game for a good, long while.","August 13, 2015","true","19.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EGANWO/recommended/365450/","EGANWO","Dopefish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EGANWO/","890 products in account","Overview:\nHacknet is at its heart a digital exploration game. Using a powerful suite of programs that you gain throughout the game, the player must gain access to systems and perform contracts. The game has a very similar feeling to the older game Uplink and hacking is done through speed, knowledge of your tools, and system resource management (RAM).\n\nPlot:\nThe plot is pretty threadbare, but does a good job of pulling the overarching story together. The ending makes sense, but is a little lacklustre for the scope of what you supposedly accomplish. However, this is in character for hacking since public attention is bad for those at the fringe of legality. Overall, I enjoyed the plot, but the beginning intro and ending are really the only interesting points. It's difficult to do characterization when all you have is text, but I felt that more effort could have been put into letting the player get to know more of the other people in the story (naix, maybe some backstory on bit, etc.)\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is separated into two parts: hacking and forensics. The actual hacking is rather easy since most trace timers last far more than long enough and some systems actually keep your admin after you disconnect. The main challenge in this format is simply knowing which order to run the port hacking programs in so that you can maximize efficiency and minimize time spent not logged in. These do get quite intense at times and a few conflict sequences definitely run the point home that you're not invulnerable. Progress through the game is blocked in a sort of metroid-vania way, in the sense that you need this power to unlock that type of port to enter. I enjoyed this, but wished that there were more early systems that you needed to backtrack to.\n\nThat backtracking is part of the second part of the gameplay, the forensics. By this I mean that you spend your time going through file systems trying to spot the file with the password, scanning computers to reach connected nodes, and searching for new IPs to check out. In fact, there is an entirely alternative gameplay path that is only reached with diligent use of your tools. I loved the exploring, but it did feel quite limited, or at the very least truncated to be more accessable for players who might not be used to the gameplay style.\nPart of the joy of the exploration comes from the humor that you find in random files. From a script for "Titanic 2" that involves the icebergs running onto land and attacking people to Bash.org IRC logs, there is a decent amount of silliness and joy to discover. However, since the files in the systems you hack are procedurally generated, more content would have been nice. There's only so many times that you can see the same Bash log before you stop wanting\nto check them out because you feel you've seen everything.\n\nPros:\n*really fun\n*sense of satisfaction from difficult hacks\n*humor: From a mission where you need to write "d*cks" on the main webpage of "Nortron Security" to an homage to *chans (the secret /el/ image board), the game is very funny and self aware.\n*exploration\n*failure penalty fair\n*short: Hacknet doesn't wear out its welcome, which it probably would have for some players by the end game.\n\nCons:\n*repetitive\n*short\n*not enough content\n*exploration feels like it was stunted for ease of access\n\nHopes:\n*mods:\nI feel that mods could make this from a good game to a great game. I'd love to try my hand at adding new features to the game.\n*hardware changes\nUplink let the player purchase hardware upgrades to increase ram or processing power as well as giving access to more complicated systems. Hacknet's only customization for your computer is changing the display theme.\n*more story\nGetting to know the other hackers more personally would be very enjoyable.\n*higher difficulty\nclearing the logs on a system means that they won't track you down - but this presents a problem. You always leave a disconnect log, but the game doesn't notice that a disconnect log without a matching connect log implies\nthat the IP that disconnected was responsible for the attack. Having to selectively clear logs and/or bounce IP like Uplink might be a good idea. In addition, I would have enjoyed more difficult forensics and encrypted files\nthat you can't find the password for. I was a little miffed a few times when I spent some time looking through the files to find the next IP when all I had to do was type "scan". More threats to the player as well as uncertainty\nin how well you performed the attack would be welcome.\n*more challenges\nMaybe adding in new network architecture requiring the player to do a different minigame than typing the first two letters of a program and tab completing.\n*multiplayer\nmultiplayer is hinted at being in development in the files on the endgame server.\n\nBottom Line:\nI love this game and want to spend so much more time on it, but sadly it seems that there's no more content. This type of game is sadly lacking in today's market and is quite unique. It pulls off what it does well and with much better guidance than Uplink.

I sat down 4 hours ago and started this game and before I knew it I had blazed through the whole thing.\n\nI'm a big fan of hacking games, especially ones that mix pseudo-realistic stuff with fun Hollywood-style flair. Uplink, released in 2001, is still one of my favorite games because no game before or since really hit that sweet spot. Until Hacknet!\n\nThis is a compelling, challenging game with a solid framework of simple mechanics that require you to be ever-more precise and fast in your execution. It also features a number of puzzles that never seem unfair, and yet also never insult your intelligence with hand-holding.\n\nIn comparison to Uplink, Hacknet has no RPG elements, for better or worse. I liked doing random missions over and over again in Uplink to grind up cash to buy a faster processor, new software, etc, but I'm sure many people will prefer Hacknet's more direct and explicit design. Actually, the contracts you're sent on don't feel random at all - each one is a unique challenge in some way, and overall the game is far, far less tedious than Uplink.\n\nThe story follows a fairly predictable arc, but that's okay. What keeps you playing isn't wondering what will happen next, but what new type of security you'll have to learn to deal with. The flow of new content is paced perfectly. You're not rushed into a bunch of stuff you don't understand, and you're never just killing time.\n\nThere are some nitpicks - I think a few of the challenges might overwhelm people that can't or won't use the terminal, and frankly those Bash.org quotes that are everywhere are older than most of the people on Steam.... but this is a fantastic game at a fair price. If you like puzzles, action, and aren't afraid to type out "cat irc_chat.txt", then do yourself a favor and pick this up today.","December 25, 2015","true","4.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

In reality, it isn’t far removed from Kali Linux, a distribution of the open source operating system favored by security professionals and hackers alike.\n\nMost of the game takes place inside that command prompt, where a minimalistic tutorial teaches the player how to list files in a directory, copy and remove files, and run executables.

Definitely feels like a long-due spiritual successor to Uplink. Improves on it in a lot of ways, too; for example, by requiring the player to use a command-line interface rather than just clicking and dragging widgets around. It's also really fun and the soundtrack is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥in'.\n\nOkay, now for the criticisms.\n\nFirst, the game is way too easy and straightforward. Hacking every system can essentially be boiled down into three steps: take down firewall/proxy, open ports, run magical hacking tool. Missions are similarly straightforward: once you Hack into the Mainframe™ you dig around for clues, and if that fails, use your magical scan tool. Sometimes you're on a timer. And so on.\n\nSecond, missions are way too linear and the progression is kinda bugged. You are automatically assigned one mission at any given moment, and canceling it breaks the game by preventing you from proceeding to the next story-important mission. Some missions, e.g. the /el sidequest line, don't even trigger unless you meet some very specific criteria, and you can't backtrack to it later on. And even on the final set of missions, you can't even complete it unless you track down one very specific piece of software from a specific quest line which may or may not be available to you before the story-critical mission is forced upon you.\n\nThird, a lot of hacking is just waiting for your damn magical programs to crack open ports and passwords for you after typing stuff into the command line. Which is boring, especially considering there usually isn't much of a challenge to begin with.\n\nAnyway it's still a good game and I have zero regrets about throwing money at it.","August 20, 2015","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

How wrong I was.\nWhen you launch a game, you start by receiving a message from Bit, telling that he's already dead if you read this, and then asking you some requests.\nSo you just do what he wants, without really knowing why, but hey, you're doing a dead man's last requests.\nAfter some hacking and deleting stuff, he'll told you that he hasn't the time to learn you more, and that you have to join a small group of hackers.\nThen you'll just complete some contracts, eventually acquiring some new hacking tools and learning more on how to hack things, to finally join another group of hackers, but more experienced and related to Bit.\nYou'll complete some more contracts, until someone contacts you about Bit and his disappearance, asking you to help him to investigate this.\n\nSo the game is basically a succession of contracts/missions, but each of them has its short but not uninteresting story.\nFor example, you'll have to hack the server of a company in order to delete a file they asked a hacker to get, or you'll need to hack a school server to add a degree for someone, hack the personal computer of a scientist to see if he's not working on a personal project, etc ...\nSpecial mention for the Junebug Project (seriously, do that one, because yes, you don't have to do all the contracts to progress in the story).\n\nAlso don't forget to read the logs in /home folders, there are a lot of funny hidden things ;)\n\nGameplay\nThe game is very pleasant to play and easy to take in hand, but also very fun. Basically, you just run programs to open ports to be able to hack. Of course, there are plenty of other things to do, but I won't tell you everything, otherwise it won't be fun for you :p\nSo while progressing in the game, you will obtain more tools to be able to hack more sophisticated and protected machines, but the more things you'll have to do, the more time it will take, and sometimes, you don't have time because you're traced, so you have to deal with everything you know to be as fast as possible and to succeed in your mission.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack of this game is really amazing, it can be relaxing when you're doing easy contracts or pressing when you're in a hurry, it adapts very well during the game.\nShout-out for the last mission with this absolute masterpiece from Carpenter Brut : Roller Mobster.\nBit by Chris Larkin is also a very good one, but they all are :p\nAlso, this soundtrack reminds me a bit the Hotline Miami soundtrack, in the style, and that's a good point for me.\n\n\nPros\nVery cool and deep story\nPleasant gameplay, plus easy to take in hand\nAwesome soundtrack\nInteresting contracts/missions\n\nCons\nThere are still some bugs, like missions not starting, but it's not frequent (happened to me once)\nA little short, but for the price it's ok. You can still start a new game and do the contracts you didn't, plus there's an alternate way to do the game ;)\n\n\nReally a great revelation for me, one of my favorite game, but you might not like it if you don't like programming at all (or maybe you will like it, just try it out ;).\nBuy it with no hesitation, and the soundtrack with it :p","January 12","true","15.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's quite possible to miss achievements, which gives the game a bit of replayability. While it's possible to get all of them on a single playthrough, it's highly unlikely without a guide.\n\nEven if you're a complete novice, the game explains how to do enough without you needing to resort to a guide. This is the best way to enjoy the game - its a puzzle game at heart, and you're really stripping away a lot of the enjoyment if you do decide to use a guide on your first go-around.\n\nI really have no negatives to talk about, except one that will mean nothing unless you're a command-line junky already. The game only allows for simple one-off commands, so no redirecting outputs or &&ing commands. Really, this is just a nitpick. Everything else was great.\n\nWhile I got this on sale, I wouldn't have regretted my purchase had I bought it at full price.

They're supposed to be tedious. But somehow, speed-typing commands into a minimal UI becomes *exciting*.\n\nThere's a wonderful cyclic experience buried in the core of this game. And it works because the game does such a stellar job of methodically introducing the player to the concepts they'll need, but in a way that makes the player feel smart for finding and interpreting that introduction, then applying it. The explanations are there, but they're buried within the game itself, and require the use of the tools that the player already has to access them.\n\nIn a world where there's a billionty games on Steam, Hacknet is a breath of fresh air, and a unique, compelling experience.","January 20","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nwabudikemorgan/recommended/365450/","nwabudikemorgan","Seldon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nwabudikemorgan/","157 products in account","Amazing game. Definitely feels like a long-due spiritual successor to Uplink. Improves on it in a lot of ways, too; for example, by requiring the player to use a command-line interface rather than just clicking and dragging widgets around. It's also really fun and the soundtrack is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥in'.\n\nOkay, now for the criticisms.\n\nFirst, the game is way too easy and straightforward. Hacking every system can essentially be boiled down into three steps: take down firewall/proxy, open ports, run magical hacking tool. Missions are similarly straightforward: once you Hack into the Mainframe™ you dig around for clues, and if that fails, use your magical scan tool. Sometimes you're on a timer. And so on.\n\nSecond, missions are way too linear and the progression is kinda bugged. You are automatically assigned one mission at any given moment, and canceling it breaks the game by preventing you from proceeding to the next story-important mission. Some missions, e.g. the /el sidequest line, don't even trigger unless you meet some very specific criteria, and you can't backtrack to it later on. And even on the final set of missions, you can't even complete it unless you track down one very specific piece of software from a specific quest line which may or may not be available to you before the story-critical mission is forced upon you.\n\nThird, a lot of hacking is just waiting for your damn magical programs to crack open ports and passwords for you after typing stuff into the command line. Which is boring, especially considering there usually isn't much of a challenge to begin with.\n\nAnyway it's still a good game and I have zero regrets about throwing money at it.","August 20, 2015","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Forget your Uplinks, forget your Hacker Evolutions. Both games Have their merits and flaws. And i have been an Uplink fan for years, every since my years as a spotty teen who loved the idea of being a cinema style hacker (Oddly, this led me to learn Penetration Testing {"White-Hat"hacking}). Uplink gave me that to some extent. Hacker Evolutions was a good hacking game, but for me it did not have that cinematic feel to it. It felt like it was taking itself too seriously (Just my opinion).\n\nThen Hacknet pops up on my radar...\nI checked it out and added it to my wishlist. I wasn't sure about it. It looked like it had the UI similar somewhat to Uplink, with the command terminal similar to Hacker Evolution. Could such a combination work?\n\nAfter buying the game and playing only an hour of it, it not only worked well but it was... Is my dream hacking simulator. It is less point and click than Uplink (Something that felt a little un-hacker-like) But has enough UI to give it that cinematic vibe. The command console is complicated enough to make it interesting as a way of interacting with the game (with a few very nice nods and winks to RL hacking.) The console also made the game challenging. You have the option to use your mouse to interact with the UI, but you can also choose to use the console almost entirely. The latter option really makes things more immersive, in my opinion.\n\nI could gush about this game all day. But, no one thing is perfect. So here are the negatives to the game:\nThe biggest issue this game has is that it has a somewhat steep learning curve. If you are not used to using a console on something like Linux, or even the command console in Windows, you are gonna have to really pay attention. And with the possibility of angering some people, there are a fair few gamers out there that want things easy. They dont want to have to learn skills beyond the usual game keybinds (prove to me i am wrong and i will take everything back with a full apology.)\nThis is probably a personal qualm, but the UI for this game, though accessible and nice looking, feels too unrealistic. I know, i know i said i like the cinematic style. And i do. But sometimes i think its easy to go too cinematic in a game like this, ya' know?\n\nAll in all, if you are looking for a good hacking simulator, this is it. No other way around it. Its the closest a game has gotten to a good mix of the cinematic and realistic that i think is probably possible.\n\nOh, and i hear you in the background there... I have not been ignoring the question of storyline. And honestly, With a game like this, it nice to have one. But that is only a small part of the game. The amount of storyline i have seen has been good (though it has only been a small part). A sort of conspiracy theory vibe. But dont get this game for its story. Just dont. Its about hacking. Having fun doing such an activity without it actually being illegal. Go read peoples emails and documents. Have a laugh. Go try a few things, challenge yourself. And then slowly do the story. Just make sure you have fun with the game mechanics along the way. 'kay?","March 27","true","7.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That alone gives it a cool feeling, it's really easy to delve directly into the story and feeling and believe that you really are opening computers and doing missions.

Its user interface is very convincing and sleek, and there is just enough recognizable computer-jargon to make it somewhat realistic without making it boring or too dense to understand. Using the command terminal is way faster (and way cooler) then just using the GUI and makes you feel like you're the real deal.\n\nDownsides to the game are the occasional spelling mistakes and the lack of explanation at some points in the game. My biggest issue with the game, however, is the complete linearity of the game. It never feels like you're interacting with a bigger world around you, just a pre-determined set of servers you have to hack, which is a shame. If it could be expanded somewhat to include a more dynamic 'internet' for you to explore, and more leeway in how to approach missions, this would've been the new standard in hacking sims.

You also cannot upgrade your hardware, bounce your signal all over the world before hitting your target (goes to trace time), and there is no passive search (that I have noticed) going on on the background, which means that either I'm really carefull in removing my tracers or the police will never actually go looking for you.\n\nIt is however, very true to the feel of the game. So if you like your hacking games with old-school typing and none (okay, a little) of that sissy-pants clicking with mice this is definately a recommended title for your library.\n\nInteresting side-note; You get to hack into someone's pacemaker to fullfill his wish of being euthenized.

Enjoyable, but a bit on the simple side. The visuals are pleasing, all the hacking tools look nice when they run. The music tracks are great.\n\nThe game is not as long as I would've hoped for. According to steam 8 hours but that figure is somewhat inflated. Probably offers a good 7 hours of gameplay.\n\nDuring my playthrough I know I missed how to stop a hacker in time, so maybe I'll replay at some point. Don't know if I missed anything else. I feel the replay value is probably quite low, as the missions seem to be pretty much static.\n\nHowever, if there ever was a sequel/dlc/addon for this game I would definately buy it. Hopefully with more hacking tools and a ton of new missions. More complexity please!\n\nMaybe the best part of the game was all the humour in the in-game IRC quotes and dialogue scattered in notes around the game. Especially the "double-layering" of the Decypher software boss and his lawsuit. *d'oh\n\n\nSome of my negatives;\n\nI'd hoped for maybe some sort of mini-games when you run some of these hacking tools, but essentially they all work the same way. Run the tool and wait. (so, maybe more things to do like how analyzing firewalls works?) Also I think the end-game was disappointing, story, and lengthwise, and not being able to use those things you saw on entech servers. I just wish there was more depth to it, more things to do and to explore, more tools, more story, more missions, more everything..\n\nAlso the game is clearly not designed for 2560x1600, ended up playing at half-res, The game did crash a few times, but I was able to recover from a nearby auto-save each time so it was okay.

You also cannot upgrade your hardware, bounce your signal all over the world before hitting your target (goes to trace time), and there is no passive search (that I have noticed) going on on the background, which means that either I'm really carefull in removing my tracers or the police will never actually go looking for you.\n\nIt is however, very true to the feel of the game. So if you like your hacking games with old-school typing and none (okay, a little) of that sissy-pants clicking with mice this is definately a recommended title for your library.\n\nInteresting side-note; You get to hack into someone's pacemaker to fullfill his wish of being euthenized. It's stuff like that that bring this game a new moral level.","August 15, 2015","true","6.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Either way, if you love to work with command line interface's (CLI) or you like to mess around with it, go ahead and get this kind of game. It's indeed a hacking simulator however, I don't think it's that realstic. Systems have more security in real life than in the game ofcourse. Don't expect to be a hacker after playing this game :')\n\nFeaturesAnyway, yes - the game has a nice structure and every detail is gorgeous. It has a kind of a storyline but via contracts. You work for peope/companies and do small tasks. With easy tools that are located on your pc (in the game) you can use them as a command and mess around with it - with that I mean ... exploit ports, overload proxyservers, send internet worms, crack SSH port and more!  It's all about digging around, and because of this you might find hilarious IRC quote's and other data that you need  - even scripts. But sometimes it's not easy as you can get tracked down when you start to hack someone's system.. or another hacker removes one of your system files so you can't use your GUI anymore, then you are forced to use your CLI.\n\nThe game is also newbie-friendly, just type "help" and you can see all the commands that you need while playing the game. It won't get bored ... not at all - I love this kind of stuff so I can't dislike it, not at all.\n\nThere's so much to say ... just try it out c:\n\nI recommend this game for all people. Really, it's fun and the ending - when you finish last quest of Bit - is amazing.\n\n2 of those funny quotes\n<Beeth> Girls are like internet domain names, the ones I like are already taken.\n<honx> well, you can stil get one from a strange country :-P\n<@David> Yay I get laid today!

On the surface it seems like a hacking game somewhat in the style of games like Uplink, but with a huge amount of polish. However, when you actually get in to it, its better described as a really clever puzzle game with a very compelling story, wrapped in a layer of hacking. The music and the visuals are fantastic, the whole package is put together to make it feel less like you're loading up a game from steam, and more like you're logging in to a VM and stepping in to the story.\n\nProspective buyers need to know that this game requires you to learn and use command line functions in order to do most stuff. It does an adequate job of explaining these to the user, however if I had one criticism it would be in this area.  Had I not had command line experience in the past, I would have found the game much less accessible. I feel the game could have done a better job of introducing these concepts to a command line novice.\n\nWith that said, if you like puzzle games, if you like a good mystery, if you have any interest in hacking or computer security, and the idea of a command-line interface doesnt put you off, this game is a must buy.","December 3, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While incredibly old by this point, I still consider Uplink to be the pinnacle of hacking "simulation" games. While other games sometimes offered more technical depth to the hacking procedures than Uplink, they didn't manage to immerse you in the story like Uplink did. They didn't make me disconnect from the internet out of paranoia like the first time I played Uplink. And while I can't say that Hacknet made me disconnect from the internet (mostly due to knowledge and experience gained over the past 14 years), it made me fall in love with the genre all over again.\n\nWhile the basics of the game are straightforward (connecting to nodes, overloading proxies, hacking ports, erasing logs, etc...), you are rewarded for being curious. Finding helpful programs, extra information on your targets, or the hilarious IRC logs that are included from bash.org are just some of the things you can find. Some of the later levels are quite challenging despite the simple mechanics. And there is an immense sense of accomplishment when you back-hack someone who wrecked your system, only to get all of their information, hack them, and completely wipe their terminal.\n\nThere are a ton of references to all kinds of hacker related media. Movies, games (with plenty aimed at Uplink), nerd culture, prominent authors, and some well-known security groups all get nods from this game. On top of that, some of the information you gain access to while on contracts is absolutely hilarious. Sure, there are a few grammatical/spelling errors here and there, but the content of the game is still outstanding.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who played Uplink, or is a fan of computers and computer security in general. No, it's not realistic, it's not accurate, it's not perfect...but it is damn fun.","December 4, 2015","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was actually planning to make one like this myself at one point, but work/life changed that.\n\nLinux was such a clear choice for this, great job!\nThough I think they should have built in a real terminal with a modified kernel, or at the least given us [vi] and [mkdir] for organizational and informational purposes. Anyone that has messed with linux will fall right into this, it fits like a glove.\nWell made game, I'm still diving into the "rabbit hole" to see what other goodies this game has within it. So far I am highly impressed.\n\nThe one thing though that they should have done better was the netMap. It's slightly too cumbersome and nodes on the side have their tooltips clipped.

You'll know by then if you like it.\n\nFULL:  This is a solid game that is easily worth the purchase price.  If you are interested in Dilbert comics, you will probably enjoy the humour in this game.  If you are interested in networking, you will probably appreciate the toned-down technical aspects of this game.  If you are a lazy person who collapses under pressure and hates to read... you might want to move on.\n\nI personally find the game acts as a refresher of sorts for the basic CMDs that we tend to forget in this GUI heavy age.  Yes, you may run into grammar and spelling errors throughout the playtime -but honestly, I feel that the communications that occur in this game, the ones you pick thru and piece together over several nodes, could actually take place.  The humanity in the conversations is there, errors and all, and I believe this is what draws the player in.  You do not lose complete focus on what you are meant to do, as much of your play circles around and ties upon itself.  If your current mission is not directly related to the main story, it is training for the next leg that will be taking place shortly. And there are actually very different ways to accomplish tasks!  Do you  delete and replace a file?  Rename it?  download it, modify, and reupload?  Which "group/faction" do you really want to participate with?  Did you fully explore all those IP addresses in the emails?  Gahh... I need to go back and play thru again!","January 2","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It has all the elements that I was looking for since playing Uplink.\n- Console based interface balances well with a graphical interface.\n- Visually pleasing animations\n- Fun "against the clock" visuals\n- It doesn't "punish" the user too much for failure. (Which is how I felt about Uplink)\n- Great story element\n- Excellen use of flavor text\n\nThe good far out weighs the bad, but I'll include a few things that I didn't like just to for honesty:\n- The network map gets a little crowded.\n- The note system seemed to take up more memory than it should\n- No upgrade system, therefore no sense of reward.  But this was more of a linear story, so that's to be expected.\n- Too linear.  It's a story driven game.  Each mission is designed to take you on to the next.  Once you're done, you're done.\n- The network map gets a bit crowded towards the end.\n\nIf you were to make a Hacknet 2, please pleasel PLEASE make it more sand-box like.  Auto generating missions, an embedded story element that doens't end the game, an upgrade/cash system, aybe a defense based system to deflect incoming attacks.

It is a hacking game and can be enjoyed by people experienced with command lines or people who have no idea about that. The way most people play this is using the OS it gives you,hacknet and the command line interface. However, you can use only commands to navigate your way through most of the game. However you do have to use the mouse every now and then. Other than that, the gameplay and story is amazing. Some people just like getting the job done as fast as possible, or you could read though the files on each computer and find some pretty interesting and funy stuff. "HELLO EVERYONE :try using caplocks:"THANK YOU ITS MUCH EASIER TO TYPE NOW" for some reason I laughed and laughed at this. The story is pretty great, too. I don't want to spoil to much of it, so I'll just say you are tracing down a person named bit, a hacker.

While this game doesn't depict hacking realistically, it does present a series of pretty entertaining puzzles and tons of not only flavor text, but also side activities with a few nuggets of cool hidden content. It may sound stupid, but it reminded me of that really gimmicky and ultimately pretty useless Enter the Matrix minigame (that I *loved*), only properly turned into a 10 hour game. It also adds the ability for the player to alter files and it allows him/her to "communicate" with the rest of NPCs (not really, the game just expects sometimes to say something but most of the time is just flavor. I still found it fun and immersive to use, even if it's ultimately pointless most times.)\n\nThe story becomes a bit too rushed towards the very ending, which is a bit of a shame, but overall at 1€ per hour -and I gotta admit I kinda nolifed it a bit- is a pretty great value for a game that not only is wildly entertaining and surprisingly tense at times, it will feel super confortable if you are even just a tiny bit computer savvy. I still miss being able to make folders and files (you can, with save editing, but it's not very confortable), a proper text editor, a better network map and probably too some kind of endless mode. Oh well.\n\nOh, and keep a look out for wild Carpenter Bruts.

It is a hacking game and can be enjoyed by people experienced with command lines or people who have no idea about that. The way most people play this is using the OS it gives you,hacknet and the command line interface. However, you can use only commands to navigate your way through most of the game. However you do have to use the mouse every now and then. Other than that, the gameplay and story is amazing. Some people just like getting the job done as fast as possible, or you could read though the files on each computer and find some pretty interesting and funy stuff. "HELLO EVERYONE :try using caplocks:"THANK YOU ITS MUCH EASIER TO TYPE NOW" for some reason I laughed and laughed at this. The story is pretty great, too. I don't want to spoil to much of it, so I'll just say you are tracing down a person named bit, a hacker. It's very intringuing and trust me, you'll want to find out everything you can about the story.\n\nTL:DR Hacking fun for all sizes and shapes along with a compelling story","October 22, 2015","true","35.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even though the game still has some bugs, it is definitely worth checking out (the updates are coming).\n\nIt's a hacking sim ala Uplink or Hacker series. It is using the stylized interface, but at the same time asks the user to learn to use a command line too. Those, who have worked on Linux will feel almost at home. You have to be careful about your actions but at the same time should be curious and attentive. There are hidden secrets to be found. You can easily lock yourself from progressing by deleting a file that seems unnecessary now, but will be later. You can kill off your own system if you're not careful. It puts all the power in your hands, you take the blame for your faults.\n\nStoryline was intriguing and scaringly possible in reality. From start to end it was an extremely enjoyable experience.

I know a lot of people will be turned off by a CL interface game. but heck (huehue), it's beautiful, intuitive and well designed. plus you can download more UIs from servers and people you hacked\n- gameplay. it's relatively easy, requiring (so far, I'm roughly 4 hours into the game) simple management skills, a keen eye and some reading and prioritizing. the hacking is served well, not letting you button mash, but rather focused on the finer points such as: reading emails for usernames and passwords, changing websites headers into vulgarities, finding the right tools and balance, covering your tracks.\na lot of the gameplay is indeed done over a command line interface, which, exactly, means you type out what you wanna do. there's helps, and little tools making it a lot easier than real life hacking could ever be.\n- Story. it's a pretty cool mix of paranoia, technology and a weird form of justice. no one talks, no fancy cutscenes. it's all in your head, buddy\n- immersion. yeah, the computers you hack are rather empty, but what is on there is hilarious and often gives small hints to connections between the hackers you 'meet' (I think, at least\n- music. absolutely perfect.\n\nCons:\n- uhm, let me think ... hmmm ... no, it is exactly what it says it is. and then some\n\nVerdict:\n\nYou like hacking/hacking movies or just recently discovered Mr Robot or the deep web?\nWell, come on in. this is a perfect supplement to your diet.\nHacknet is pretty (for CL standards :D as I work in IT I actually find it gorgeous), fun and fast paced. It will test your patience, but mostly your ability to read and type properly.\nBut nothing is keeping it from delivering the best hacker game since Uplink, if not even a tick better.\nAnd it is totally worth the price tag","December 9, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I mean you get attacked once in the game, then things get super easy.\n\nThere a couple of similar title and like I said coming from uplink I would have expected things to have evolved since 1990 where we would have a somewhat hacking simulator game that offers plenty to the nerds.\n\n\nI liked this game, I am far from done as I am looking into finishing some of the achievements but unfortunatly some weird bugs block from completing some of the achievements therefore another test run is in order.\n\n\nGOTY? mmmmhhhhh maybe for indie game category but this title would need another UAT as there are actual bugs in here.","December 15, 2015","true","25.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was actually planning to make one like this myself at one point, but work/life changed that.\n\nLinux was such a clear choice for this, great job!\nThough I think they should have built in a real terminal with a modified kernel, or at the least given us [vi] and [mkdir] for organizational and informational purposes. Anyone that has messed with linux will fall right into this, it fits like a glove.\nWell made game, I'm still diving into the "rabbit hole" to see what other goodies this game has within it. So far I am highly impressed.\n\nThe one thing though that they should have done better was the netMap. It's slightly too cumbersome and nodes on the side have their tooltips clipped. A tree view would have been entirely sufficient; or at least some way to organize it in terms of what you want to see rather than all posssible nodes visible at once.\n\nGreat job.

It has all the elements that I was looking for since playing Uplink.\n- Console based interface balances well with a graphical interface.\n- Visually pleasing animations\n- Fun "against the clock" visuals\n- It doesn't "punish" the user too much for failure. (Which is how I felt about Uplink)\n- Great story element\n- Excellen use of flavor text\n\nThe good far out weighs the bad, but I'll include a few things that I didn't like just to for honesty:\n- The network map gets a little crowded.\n- The note system seemed to take up more memory than it should\n- No upgrade system, therefore no sense of reward.  But this was more of a linear story, so that's to be expected.\n- Too linear.  It's a story driven game.  Each mission is designed to take you on to the next.  Once you're done, you're done.\n- The network map gets a bit crowded towards the end.\n\nIf you were to make a Hacknet 2, please pleasel PLEASE make it more sand-box like.  Auto generating missions, an embedded story element that doens't end the game, an upgrade/cash system, aybe a defense based system to deflect incoming attacks.  These are the things that I crave.","February 9","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're helping a variety of hacker agencies with a variety of hacker missions via your not-so-trusty hacker computer.  The overall experience involves a lot of repetitive clicking of generic hacker 'tools' that do all the dirty work for you.  That said, the game can help you learn about navigating folder structures via the command line, and there are some "oh ♥♥♥♥" moments when you think you may have and probably will have screwed yourself.","February 1","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I was actually planning to make one like this myself at one point, but work/life changed that.\n\nLinux was such a clear choice for this, great job!\nThough I think they should have built in a real terminal with a modified kernel, or at the least given us [vi] and [mkdir] for organizational and informational purposes. Anyone that has messed with linux will fall right into this, it fits like a glove.\nWell made game, I'm still diving into the "rabbit hole" to see what other goodies this game has within it. So far I am highly impressed.\n\nThe one thing though that they should have done better was the netMap. It's slightly too cumbersome and nodes on the side have their tooltips clipped. A tree view would have been entirely sufficient; or at least some way to organize it in terms of what you want to see rather than all posssible nodes visible at once.\n\nGreat job.

You'll know by then if you like it.\n\nFULL:  This is a solid game that is easily worth the purchase price.  If you are interested in Dilbert comics, you will probably enjoy the humour in this game.  If you are interested in networking, you will probably appreciate the toned-down technical aspects of this game.  If you are a lazy person who collapses under pressure and hates to read... you might want to move on.\n\nI personally find the game acts as a refresher of sorts for the basic CMDs that we tend to forget in this GUI heavy age.  Yes, you may run into grammar and spelling errors throughout the playtime -but honestly, I feel that the communications that occur in this game, the ones you pick thru and piece together over several nodes, could actually take place.  The humanity in the conversations is there, errors and all, and I believe this is what draws the player in.  You do not lose complete focus on what you are meant to do, as much of your play circles around and ties upon itself.  If your current mission is not directly related to the main story, it is training for the next leg that will be taking place shortly. And there are actually very different ways to accomplish tasks!  Do you  delete and replace a file?  Rename it?  download it, modify, and reupload?  Which "group/faction" do you really want to participate with?  Did you fully explore all those IP addresses in the emails?  Gahh...

I have been running Archlinux with the i3 window manager for about a year now. People who aren't used to terminal interactions or problem solving in a terminal enviroment may not enjoy this game as much as I have.\n\nThat being said, this game is just fantastic, and surprisingly immersive. The first time I was hacked and my game bluescreened, I actually jumped. When it threw me into a failing boot, and then into a framebuffer terminal, and spit out errors about missing my x-server.sys file, I had flashbacks to similar issues happening on this exact PC not more than a year ago. It didn't just look like linux problem solving, it felt like linux problem solving. For a game that uses mainly a terminal, it is extremely immersive.\n\nThe problem solving in the game is just superb, when dealing with a traced connection, you genuinely feel under pressure to complete what you are doing, and although earlier systems feel quite repetetive, the later opponents feel challenging and complex. Managing your system's RAM usage, watching the trace, and frantically looking through the files on a system through a traced connection, one of the best feelings in gaming from 2015.\n\nHeck, even the visuals in this game are quite impressive, and surprisingly customizeable. You can actually obtain entirely new x-server.sys files, just by scp'ing (secure copying) them off of systems that you hack, and you can start. It's actually something you could go through the whole game without ever being aware of. BEWARE: FIRST TIME HACKED SPOILER the first time you are hacked in the game, likely from a guy going by the username 'Naix' after messing with some of his stuff, your screen goes black and then opens an all too terrifying screen for any Windows user. The Bluescreen of Death. The PC then reboots, and fails to find your x-server.sys because that asshat 'Naix' deleted it. You then need to obtain another from another server, which you can find the IP for in your log files. I was surprised when I booted that I was actually met with another 'window manager' (or at-least another theme).\n\nI can't quite comment on the quality of the game's soundtrack all that well, as when I play this, I blast my 'Coding' playlist in Spotify, but from what I was hearing between my songs, the soundtrack seems quite nice, although a bit too 'techno' for my tastes. It also seems to entirely lack vocals in any of it's songs, which is understandable.\n\nReccomendations to the DevelopersSo, here I will leave suggestions I feel the developers could (and should) implement to even further improve their already fantastic game.\n\n1: Control+Key keybindings commonly found in linux terminals would be an amazing addition. For example, I've played the game for 3 hours, but still press Ctrl+L when I want to clear the screen, or Ctrl+C when I want to stop my current command, like "rm log/*".\n\n2:Ability to further customize your x-server setup would be nice, like the ability to move the Windows, instead of locking them to where they are defined for the x-server.sys currently used. Not a very required feature, but would be hell'a cool :)\n\n3: Maybe make the window showing all the currently known servers just a little bit larger, as it gets crowded on resolutions lower than 1920x1080p.\n\nTL;DR:PROS:\n+Extremely immersive gameplay\n+Later gameplay is quite open, and enjoyable\n+Easy to pickup, whatever OS you normally use, although Linux users will find many similar commands and behaviors.\n+Good soundtrack (from what I've heard)\n+More addictive than crack-cocaine, and (probably) safer than it too!\n\nCONS:\n-Kind of slow game intro (first 30min to 45min is sort of linear and not very open)\n-For users who have never even opened a terminal before, never mind used one, the game might have a slightly difficult learning curve, but not too bad.\n-Too addictive :P (Played 3 hours first night)\n\nAll this being said, I think everyone should have this in their library!","August 13, 2015","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Oh no, not just "Hacking" in the technical meaning of the term, but instead the ethical implications the inherent power of software development and manipulation in an interconnected world brings both for individuals and companies.\n\nWant a good hacking simulator? Fine, you found it. Not as complex as Introversion's amazing, but aged, Uplink, Hacknet's mechanics are still very well thought out and are just a joy to use.\n\nWant interesting stories? Found here as well. Aside some miniature stories buried in the game (which are highly entertaining if you take the time to follow them), the main story arch is captivating and culminates in a finale that will well before be initiated by yourself uttering "Wait wait WAIT a moment ..."\n\nWant good presentation? Eeeeeehh, you got me there. Hacknet is what it is, and as such it is relatively .. economical .. regarding its presentation. It has its moments though, and together with the - depending on the situation - driving and yet unobtrusive music you might be surprised in a positive way.\n\nOver all, erm. Yeah listen. That's delicious. Fractal Alligator certainly found a new fan in me. The whole game leaves the impression that its creator cares for the topic(s), loves it even, and put an amazing effort in presenting it in the best way possible.

The tutorial is easy to follow, and there are help pages that list out commands. Convenience is also there as pressing Tab will autocomplete file names, which really saves on the time wasted typing them out.\n\nIt's definitely not a training simulation for real hacking, but as a game it's simple enough to enjoy and complex enough to keep your attention.\n\nIf you have an interest in hacking, then it's a definite buy.\n\nRuns at 144fps too for that silky smooth feel!","August 18, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While it certainly bears a lot of similarities to Uplink, the two games are quite different under the surface. Where Uplink is a sandbox, where the net is your playground, Hacknet is a more focused, and much deeper experience.\n\nIt is essentially a text based adventure game, but instead of typing actions your character does, you type commands into the console to hack stuff. It's intuitive and very fun to use once you get the hang of it, and the game does a good job of making you use it in intuitive and challenging ways.\n\nThe game also has a more graphic interface (which can be customised with various skins, once you learn how), and some things are only possible through using that, but I'd very much recommend you get used to the console command (trust me, you'll need them).\n\nSo what's the game about? To put it simply, it's about following a trail of websites and databases to uncover a mystery; you do this by compromising various systems through a robust hacking system and doing contracts for various hacker groups. It's not just about hacking, though, as you'll then have to search through the system's files to accomplish what you came for, whether it's deleting or editing a file, crashing a website, or browsing through the user's mails and documents to find a clue or a loophole through a heavily defended system. It's very fun and just as much a test of your deductive abilities as your hacking skills. The final mission especially left me stumped and unable to progress, until I realized I could use a technique that I had learned at the start of the game to find a loophole and break through.\n\nBut what really sold this game for me was the atmosphere and the story. The game does a really good job of making you feel immersed in the role of a hacker, and I could feel my heart pounding when I disconnected from a system a split second before getting traced, or when I had to hack into my ISP to change my IP-address before I got discovered. You feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ badass when you manage to breach a difficult system, or when you engage in some sweet revenge on a rival hacker. The game also left me agonizing over choices that I barely would have given a thought in other games (Two words: Project Juneburg).\n\nThe story is very well done. While it borrows some themes from Uplink, it executes them very well, and I may have felled a little tear at the ending.\n\nAll in all, if you like any of the things I mentioned, you should definitely give this game a try. This was probably one of my favorite games of 2015, and it's well worth the money.","January 15","true","8.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You're just along for the ride as the story progresses.\n\nYou pick up more and more tools that almost all do the same thing (break a type of lock with a different animation). The little hardware that is shown (memory use) is non-sensical. The tools that actually do something unique are under used (I remember having need for the "replace" command only once or twice to name one).\n\nThe story is a cliche, but mildly interesting.

The gameplay is repetitive and simplistic to put it mildly, the puzzles are absurdly easy (difficulty for me mostly came from occasionally forgetting to run the 'scan' command), and as a whole it doesn't seem quite *finished*.\n\nThe various servers and other devices are populated mostly with a few relevant files, a lot of unreadable binaries that seems like they should be relevant but turn out to be just filler, and a huge number of bash.org quotes (some of which are hilarious) sprinkled among /home/NewDirectory${x} directories.  There's little meaningful variation and it's pretty simple to find almost anything you're looking for if it's there.\n\nThe story is not terrible, but it's not particularly original or interesting either.\n\nFor the amount of time you spend using the command shell, you'd think it would be a bit more polished, e.g. the fact that commands like  'rm *' work while 'rm AccountInfo*' do not, or the existence of an 'scp' command but not just 'cp'.  The UI is kludgy and has a few interesting bugs, e.g. the file system interface fails to change directories properly if you're more than one level deep, e.g. from /home/stash to /log.  My favorite thing though is when I deleted a few files in /sys (for fun), rebooted, and was left with no (obvious) way to quit the freaking game until I fixed things sufficiently to be able to click the exit button.  Really.\n\nThe process of actually breaking into a server consists of running a series of magical programs to bypass one or more defenses, open a certain number of ports, and ultimately get admin access; there are a few hiccups with this process, but the vast majority of the time it's exactly the same.  If you see a new type of port, you find yourself often saying "I guess I need another magical program to crack this port...oh hey, the plot has delivered it right on schedule, great." or "I don't have a magical program for this yet. Wait, here's a new program conveniently nestled among the vast array of bash.org quotes...again."\n\nI could go on...\nIf you have to choose between this and Uplink, the latter (despite its shortcomings) is a far better game.  If you're an Uplink fan, you'll likely be disappointed.  With more development, I think this game could eventually equal or surpass Uplink...alas.\n\n\n","May 21","false","10.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Playing the game will enable you to easily navigate through directories and perform tasks like copying or deleting files and so on. It superficially covers the themes of hacking and how hackers interact with a network in an extremely simplistic but accessible way. This is not a study-sim for hacking but you will have a general idea of what hackers do and some of what the terms they use mean. I think this would be a useful tool for kids who want to learn how to interact with their computer without a graphical user interface. But it also presents as a great bit of practice for adults who wish to refresh their memory or teach themselves how to use the command line interface.\n\nI'd love to see this game expanded in complexity. There's a lot of fertile ground here for an amazing sequel for an already great game.

I was searching on steam for games that looked good, when I saw this game. A few days later, I bought it and I'm glad I did! This game surprised me, I wasn't really expecting much, but got a lot more than I expected. Hacknet is a game where you must help a guy named Bit that teaches you how to hack, (Along with some other people) and the only thing he wants is for you to find him. Not going to spoil much, but the amount of freedom in this game is huge. From invading other people's conversation, to changing the game's version of KFC's website from saying "Everyone loves chicken," to "Everyone loves big ♥♥♥♥♥," there's a lot of freedom in Hacknet. One thing I must say, is that you must memorize a few commands in the game, otherwise you'll be going back a lot to relearn some things. Also, you better type fast, otherwise this game will be a bit harder. One last thing I must mention, is the missions do get quite repetitive at times, but the amount of freedom in them helps. So do I recommend Hacknet? Of course, Hacknet's a great hacking game that I recommend to a lot of people.

This game is very much a hat tip to Uplink and the developer did a good job capturing the same atmosphere and attraction of Uplink without being a copy cat.  Although comparisons can be made to Uplink, the game definitely has its own voice with a mix of both commandline simulation and minimalist UI.  I've only played for a short time but it has already become one of my favorite games.  The visuals are minimalist but they're more than enough to engage you.  Add in the catchy music and compelling story and you're in for an amazing experience.\n\nWith a plethora of survival games out there its very refreshing to find a game without those elements and instead focuses on a deep storyline.

Is this an interactive digital novel? There are elements of both in this game, and I absolutely love it. This game is very similar to other hack sims out there, but this one may do it the best. Unfortunately, by the end of the gameplay I was sitting there craving more which, for the years of development, was disappointing to me. I always felt like "ok, we have all of these commands at our disposal.... now throw a wrench in the gears and give us a new OS to hack" or something along those lines. In other words, the game does get repetative after 10 hours of gameplay, but that's grasping at straws for something bad here. I also found the network map very unintuitive near the end of the game with as many networks as there were, wishing I could have deleted some manually.\n\nThe gameplay is that of a linux terminal style, where you can hop around directories and use different commands to access systems and break through security. At the end of the day, they also let you use your mouse for most of these operations which seemed pretty modern, and something I hadn't seen done before.\n\nI was addicted to it, and if you're a nerd like me, you'll be addicted too. When my main complaint is that I wish there was more to it, that can't be all that bad of a complaint.","January 9","true","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was searching on steam for games that looked good, when I saw this game. A few days later, I bought it and I'm glad I did! This game surprised me, I wasn't really expecting much, but got a lot more than I expected. Hacknet is a game where you must help a guy named Bit that teaches you how to hack, (Along with some other people) and the only thing he wants is for you to find him. Not going to spoil much, but the amount of freedom in this game is huge. From invading other people's conversation, to changing the game's version of KFC's website from saying "Everyone loves chicken," to "Everyone loves big ♥♥♥♥♥," there's a lot of freedom in Hacknet. One thing I must say, is that you must memorize a few commands in the game, otherwise you'll be going back a lot to relearn some things. Also, you better type fast, otherwise this game will be a bit harder. One last thing I must mention, is the missions do get quite repetitive at times, but the amount of freedom in them helps. So do I recommend Hacknet? Of course, Hacknet's a great hacking game that I recommend to a lot of people.

From all the experience I have gotten out of this game I can say it's like no other game on steam. Overall I think you should get it, and the best part is that they are developing multiplayer for the game. Doesn't that sound shrektacular! It goes together like ♥♥♥♥ and balls.

I was searching on steam for games that looked good, when I saw this game. A few days later, I bought it and I'm glad I did! This game surprised me, I wasn't really expecting much, but got a lot more than I expected. Hacknet is a game where you must help a guy named Bit that teaches you how to hack, (Along with some other people) and the only thing he wants is for you to find him. Not going to spoil much, but the amount of freedom in this game is huge. From invading other people's conversation, to changing the game's version of KFC's website from saying "Everyone loves chicken," to "Everyone loves big ♥♥♥♥♥," there's a lot of freedom in Hacknet. One thing I must say, is that you must memorize a few commands in the game, otherwise you'll be going back a lot to relearn some things. Also, you better type fast, otherwise this game will be a bit harder. One last thing I must mention, is the missions do get quite repetitive at times, but the amount of freedom in them helps. So do I recommend Hacknet? Of course, Hacknet's a great hacking game that I recommend to a lot of people. So get it, NOW!","February 13","true","32.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Is this an interactive digital novel? There are elements of both in this game, and I absolutely love it. This game is very similar to other hack sims out there, but this one may do it the best. Unfortunately, by the end of the gameplay I was sitting there craving more which, for the years of development, was disappointing to me. I always felt like "ok, we have all of these commands at our disposal.... now throw a wrench in the gears and give us a new OS to hack" or something along those lines. In other words, the game does get repetative after 10 hours of gameplay, but that's grasping at straws for something bad here. I also found the network map very unintuitive near the end of the game with as many networks as there were, wishing I could have deleted some manually.\n\nThe gameplay is that of a linux terminal style, where you can hop around directories and use different commands to access systems and break through security. At the end of the day, they also let you use your mouse for most of these operations which seemed pretty modern, and something I hadn't seen done before.\n\nI was addicted to it, and if you're a nerd like me, you'll be addicted too. When my main complaint is that I wish there was more to it, that can't be all that bad of a complaint.","January 9","true","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Hacknet attempts to do the complete opposite, by adding in copious amounts of esoteric Unix commands.\n\nI only played the game for an hour before applying for a refund. The in-game emails that I read were mundane, as though this game was aimed at juvenile highschoolers ( I'm 40 years old ). One email was about a high school kid making out with a girl and prematurely ejaculating in his pants. Another email was a kid talking about the latest "Call of Soldier" game.\n\nI had to do Google searches, to find out how to hack a firewall and basically gave up trying to figure out how to flood a proxy server.\n\nI dropped out of programming school in real life. Programming & hacking can be quite tedious, which is why Hollywood and Uplink: Hacker Elite try and insulate the user from the realities of hacking.\n\nI'd also like to point out that Uplink featured permadeath... which is where a lot of the tension came from.","December 31, 2015","false","1.1"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Hacknet is an extremely fun little game, with an engaging story and enough meat to warrant the purchase price. I have no background in coding, and the game didn't punish me for it. It's easy enough to get started with the basics, but also has some room to expand once you've got into your comfort zone, and gives it a surprisingly huge replayability.\n\nNot only that, but there's a decent chunk of content outside the main campaign, as well as a few branching paths that let you get to the crux of the storyline. Huge recommendation from me. I wholeheartedly recommend you check Hacknet out.","November 2, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At it's base, it is a hacker simulation detective style game with a fantastic story.  Everything you need to do is explained or you're given enough hints to figure everything out but if you've ever used a command line or played a text based adventure game you should feel right at home.\n\nLet's go over the high points:\nSound/Music - Amazing, fits the theme, shifts to fit the situation.\nGraphics - Visualizers are interesting and background art is cool.  The text is a nice readable font.\nStory - Great main story with lots of sidequests.  Events and plot devices are well executed.\nGameplay/Control - Enter text commands or point/click, easy to navigate servers, help system built in for text commands.\nPrice is VERY reasonable for the quality of this game.\n\nCons:\nIf you don't want play a hacker style detective game that makes you feel like a hacker...well I guess you won't like this then!\nIf you can't read then you won't be able to play the game.  But then you can't read this review either...so this isn't for you.\nYou aren't playing hacknet yet, you're still reading this review.\nI wish the network display was larger...this is a very minor issue.\n\nOther thoughts:\nI have finished the game.  I am certainly going to replay it as there are multiple paths and procedurely generated scenarios.  I seriously can't remember the last time I had this much fun or felt this emotional over a game.

In it's current shape there might be little room for multiplayer gameplay, because of the game mechanics, but hopefully as the game gets finalized it will be implemented.\n\nThe puzzles you have to face are fun to solve and most of the time at medium or easy difficulty level.\nEven though the game description provided on Steam might be a little misleading, as to non-holywood hacking style, or minimal hand-holding, the gameplay can be extremely exciting and satisfying.\nThe thrill of hacking, taking unauthorised control over websites, other web services, or user machines and mobile devices, identity theft or destruction, and constantly racing the trace clock are all very satisfying and will give you an addictive adrenaline rush.\n\nMusic is a very proper and enjoyable background for your virtual crimes, not quite something to remember.\n\nThe game has too high hardware requirements in my opinion. All in all it is a console based hacking game, and it is barely playable on i5, 4GB, Intel graphics HD4000 Lenovo laptop (12 fps max with too much typing lag!!!)\n\nFinally the 'Uplink vs Hacknet'Many people look up to Hacknet in comparison to Uplink.\nBased on my experiences with both titles If you did truly enjoy Uplink, You will be dazzled by Hacknet's modern design. Graphics are eyecandy.\nThe gameplay itself however, as compared to Uplink I have found to be short (if that can be said - I was unable to finish the game due to numerous bugs [despite 50+hrs in-game]), shallow and at many times unchallenging.\nIf you can bear with, well kinda outdated graphics and a little clumsy UI, I'd say Uplink offers far greater immersion, much more complex world to explore, more freedom, less hand holding.\nHardware upgrades covering several computer components to your machine, or even different, more upgradable machines (you can create them yourself or download one of many community created ones!!!!), software upgrades that all can be purchased are something you won't find in Hacknet, since finances have been taken out of the picture in the first place. Money earning, stock market participation and manipulation, and banking are all absent in Hacknet. So are LAN networks that pose a sublevel of gameplay in Uplink. Hacknet at this stage of developement also gives you the feeling of being the only web user out there, since only on rare story related events will you ever find logs left by anyone else on any servers (even the public services). Tracing other hackers or users is nearly non existent since the idea of connection bouncing has also been skipped so far. In my opinion, with similar development times of several years for both games, Uplink is a masterpiece bot technically and story-wise, compared to Hacknet.\n\nFinal wordsWhatever Hacknet is or will be, I'd say Uplink is worth playing, as the only other hacking game out there with some serious gameplay to this date.\nIf compatibility issues or the kinda-outdated-look are an obstacle for you playing Uplink, Hacknet will still be a very enjoyable and exciting experience, however I would strongly advise to wait with the purchase until numerous major bugs are addressed and more potential gets released from Hacknet, or you might be facing quite a frustrating struggle with what I can only call a beta version (at best) right now.

While in between storyline hacks the game leaves players feeling like their hacks have little reward or purpose, the stunning gameplay, visuals, and story make this game a must buy if you enjoy computers and being stressed out of your mind.\n\nHacking games such as this are always a thrill, at least in my experience. Nothing gets your heart racing more than a big red countdown as your fingers slip trying to type in a password. Hacknet is a great example of this genre.\n\nGames such as Uplink: Hacker Elite have the player take part in "Hollywood hacking", using things like password crackers and dragging bypassers over network elements. While Hacknet it far from realistic hacking, the addition of the terminal makes the game so much better. While clicking and dragging can take time, it is far more stressful to type commands under pressure than it is to click them. This is one of Hacknet's biggest strengths, and players even have the ability to completely remove the user interface and play the game strictly through the terminal.\n\nHowever, as I play Hacknet, there are periods of time where I'm not quite sure what I'm trying to acheive. I accept a contract, complete a hack, and at the end receive an email with a rank out of 100. This is where I think Uplink has the advantage; as you completed jobs you were paid money in order to upgrade you computer hardware and software. In Hacknet, the only time I really feel purposeful in my hacking in when I'm working on a hack relating to the story.\n\nOn top of great gameplay, the visuals of Hacknet are astounding. Just before writing this review I had a trace complete on me during a hack, and was greeting with the scariest red screen I've ever seen. The following sequence of trying to fix my mistake (I won't spoil anything!) was absolutely the most stressful thing I've experienced in a game.\n\nHacknet also has a great story (at least so far!), and I'm having trouble tearing myself away from the screen. All in all this game is a definite buy if you're into computers and having a heartrate of over 150.","October 26, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does feel lacking in comparison to some features of uplink, such as workstation modification and resource allocation. What this game misses on those fronts - it makes up for on the story aspect. The connecting story is compelling enough to warrent a play through, and to provide motivation to successfully complete a hack\n\nEven in failure this game gives you an opportunity to improve your skills by giving you a last ditch chance to hack your way out of your situation.\n\nHighly recommend this game as an entry into the hacker simulation genre - however if you have played others I would recommend looking at uplink, as this game is not overly complicated.","October 26, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm saying Hacknet is a derivative work of Uplink.\n\nUplink can be seen as an "open world" game. The goal is simple; do contract work, get money, upgrade your stuff. There's a "story" involved but you can completely ignore it if you so wish.\n\nHacknet is more linear. There isn't much beside the story. There is contract work, but its point is to just advance in the story. You're locked out of some of the contract work after advancing through a certain point in the story. You cannot get money or upgrade your gear, you're limited to the same amount of RAM and power you have.\n\nBased on what I said, Hacknet can be seen as a bad game, but it's everything but bad. The gameplay is amazing. The interface is well fit for what it's used for. The story is very appealing and really clutches on you to take you with it.\n\nThe game simulates a command line environment quite well, but is missing some really basic stuff you'd expect to find. The tab autocomplete is lacking. You cannot create files or folders, so you're locked to any files or folders the game gives you. There isn't a text editor, so your only way of editing files to use a replace command. Then again, the game clearly isn't directed at experienced command line users, but rather to newcomers (or "skiddies", the game even calls you such at one point) who may have never used a command line.\n\nDoing the hacking is not complicated at all. You don't have to memorise complicated command calls or signatures, you just run the right command at the right time. Most of the time you don't even need to use the command line, since usually there's a button to click or a scrollbar to drag.\n\nI was expecting a tad more realistic simulation of a command line, but the game is really good nevertheless. It took me about 5 hours to beat, after of which there isn't anything sensible to do. There are small secrets scattered around to look for and discover, if you like easter egg hunting.","August 22, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There could be more involvement in the "hacking" of the remotes in the game apart from run apps in the best sequence and then the password bypass. Throw in a puzzle or a quiz to spice it up.

While It was only a few hours to beat, it was still quite the challenge of intelect and perception. Me beating it didn't stop me from playing through it again at least 7 times before inviting my friends to buy it as well. The game itself is unique and requires the "very difficult" skill of "typing without error". If you can type, you can play this game, and you WILL get better as time goes on. A story that thouroughly intrigued me with a satisfying ending.

Hacknet is a hacking simulator which may or may not be realistic, I am not a hacker or very good with computers so I would not know but without a doubt it's worth every penny of those $10.00. The game focuses on you as the main character who is suddenly emailed by a enigmatic hacker by the name of bit who teaches you his techniques which launchs off your career as a hacker. As the game goes on you will later be approached by more and more hackers and hacker organizations. One thing I find so enjoyable is the problem solving aspect, sure plenty of the game is just using the tools at your disposal to get into this system or to hack that site but at times your knowledge of the system and the games mechanics will be put to the test. If you have any chance of beating this game you need to be smart, creative, quick to react, and you cannot break under pressure because this game can get pretty intense. Another great aspect of this game it the difficulty. At first it's relatively easy but as time goes on you will begin to notice how this game is unforgiving when you screw up. Not kidding, it's brutal here dude. The game will have multiple instances where a rival hacker is at your throat or when you have a trace running on you and you need to open and hack the ports as fast as possible to become an admin and stop the trace. Sometimes it's going to look bleak but it is soooooo satisfying when you hack the system with seconds to spare and sooooo disapointing when you fail and are wacked over the nose as a result. That does not mean this game is without problems. For one even though the format of the game is its greatest strength it also can be its greatest weakness mainly due to the fact that it is not a very engaging experience and requires you to try your best to stay on top of actually playing the game. The narrative is good without a doubt but it also can get dull at times and even kind of confusing. It's more of a mystery of trying to figure out what happened to Bit but it seems as if they tried to squeez in more and though for the most part the game flows beautifully at times it does get a little cramped. I also have a personal complaint, every time I start the game, even though my profile is still their, it starts me off at the beggining. I don't know if this is supposed to happen or not but I would assume not. I continue trying to find a solution but otherwise I have to beat the game in one consistan run which is kind of erritating but still fun. overally solid 8.5/10, worth buying.","August 30, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To avoid spoilers, I'll keep it short. It involves a notorius hacker named Bit. He fails to reconnect to his system for 14 days, his failsafe kicks in, sending instructions in automated emails to you. It's up to you to find out why.\n\nYou can get jobs from different entites, such as CSEC, to receive hack codes and malware injectors to help you along your cyber hacking adventure. Sadly, unlike Uplink, you don't earn money and you can't upgrade your computer, RAM, CPU, etc.\n\nLots of little secrets here and there, some computers have little chat logs from other users for a fun read. The music is good, nice tempo beat to it.\n\nOverall, it's a fun terminal-based hackers game with a modern day retouch.","March 27","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While, a bit more on the shorter side, the story and gameplay are filled up with tons of interesting things that will keep you immersed and continously playing all the way up to the end.\n\nThe game itself consists of just you in a terminal layout and going around hacking websites and finding out what happened to the character "Bit" as there is more to what actually happened to him then meets the eye. Even if you aren't a hacker wizard (like myself), this game is really easy on guiding you in with tons of tutorials and hints and having easy buttons like TAB to fill out the programs and make it a bit more friendly to the average player.\n\nThe story is really really immersive and honestly along with the soundtrack is the best thing about the game. The creators really did a great job of making you feel like you are the actual hacker and you are the one that is under the control of all of this. Moving around and seeing all the ways the story builds up is suspenseful, well done, and overall kept me really going and a bit suspenseful at times. The soundtrack is also top notch by the way, which help to not only add to the immersion but really help tense up at suspenseful parts in the game and also really melodic when it needs to which is also a huge plus.\n\nIn the end, Hacknet is a brilliant hacking game with puzzle/mystery solving elements, a beautiful soundtrack, a wonderful story, and in overall a great game. I don't expect this to be for everyone because the terminal layout is all you're going to see and this game does a real job portraying you as a hacker so it can be a bit tricky at times, but in the end, it's something that I believe that you should try out if you're willing to tackle on the puzzles and mysteries, as this is definitely  not a game for just the casual puzzle solver.\n\nAll in all, fantastic game albeit a bit short and sometimes a bit tricky and difficult.\n\n9/10","September 1, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm saying Hacknet is a derivative work of Uplink.\n\nUplink can be seen as an "open world" game. The goal is simple; do contract work, get money, upgrade your stuff. There's a "story" involved but you can completely ignore it if you so wish.\n\nHacknet is more linear. There isn't much beside the story. There is contract work, but its point is to just advance in the story. You're locked out of some of the contract work after advancing through a certain point in the story. You cannot get money or upgrade your gear, you're limited to the same amount of RAM and power you have.\n\nBased on what I said, Hacknet can be seen as a bad game, but it's everything but bad. The gameplay is amazing. The interface is well fit for what it's used for. The story is very appealing and really clutches on you to take you with it.\n\nThe game simulates a command line environment quite well, but is missing some really basic stuff you'd expect to find. The tab autocomplete is lacking. You cannot create files or folders, so you're locked to any files or folders the game gives you. There isn't a text editor, so your only way of editing files to use a replace command. Then again, the game clearly isn't directed at experienced command line users, but rather to newcomers (or "skiddies", the game even calls you such at one point) who may have never used a command line.\n\nDoing the hacking is not complicated at all. You don't have to memorise complicated command calls or signatures, you just run the right command at the right time. Most of the time you don't even need to use the command line, since usually there's a button to click or a scrollbar to drag.\n\nI was expecting a tad more realistic simulation of a command line, but the game is really good nevertheless. It took me about 5 hours to beat, after of which there isn't anything sensible to do. There are small secrets scattered around to look for and discover, if you like easter egg hunting.","August 22, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The interface you use to interact with the game is good and well though out but if you dont like typing then it might not be your thing, but as I have use OS's since DOS 1.1 and early days of Linux, I found it pefect for this type of text adventure game.  There could be more involvement in the "hacking" of the remotes in the game apart from run apps in the best sequence and then the password bypass. Throw in a puzzle or a quiz to spice it up.

Has very little to do with hacking, but still a fun game to play if you're apt with a shell.\n\nSummary:\nHacknet is a game in which you do various tasks for various people for various reasons. You delete files, fetch passwords, etc. See it as a puzzle game, of sorts.\n\nIf you're a bit familiar with InfoSec, you'll find several references to real-life tools like nmap, or real life ♥♥♥♥-up's (like Apple making "alpine" the default password on every iOS device).\n\nCons:\nHowever, you'll likely be disappointed that the in-game shell isn't nearly as powerful as any comparable real shell and that a lot of realism has been cut away for the sake of gameplay.\nFurther, a lot of details simply don't add up. Why does the whole world run UNIX with an open SSH port? Why do they have .dll and .exe files on UNIX? And why does it bluescreen? Why do "binary" files contain 1's and 0's when cat'd, instead of the actual ASCII representation? If you're really out for realism, I suggest you to start a real shell and get cracking - but hey, it's just a game, so enjoy.","December 18, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You type in a terminal to perform most functions, but don't let that alienate you, because you do it with only a dozen or so commands that are easy to remember. You'll pick it up as you go. But where it really shines is that it captures the same spirit of exploration and "Can I really do this...? YES I CAN!!" that made Uplink fantastic. There are some moments where the puzzles give you JUST enough information that you have to think - not by game logic, but real logic, about what to do - and it feels amazing when it pays off. It's not without flaws, being a new release at the time of writing, but save for one or two wallbanging moments it plays very smoothly. If you've played Uplink and want more (or felt that there was too much time/money management in that and would try a similar game with more story) Hacknet is for you. If you haven't played Uplink, play it first, because it has some shining moments but will feel extremely dated after the modern polish of Hacknet.","August 23, 2015","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It provides the player a virtual OS from which to interact with 'nodes' dotted around the map. Each node represents a computer system which can be approached using the software and hardware knowledge you accumulate throughout the game. Pretty simple stuff on the surface, but Hacknet is a fantastically well-designed story-driven experience, with considerable replay value which will only continue to grow as new content is invariably released.\n\nThis game deserves praise for it's graphics, in that they perfectly fit the tone of the game. In most other game genres we typically see a push toward more cutting-edge photo-realism, but here we have a clean, crisp environment that doesn't over-burden or confuse the player with menus and tedious repetitive interaction. Praise is also due to the sound design in this title. The music is, again, a perfect fit for the game's tone. Orchesteral strings move to thumping bass adding a sense of pressure and drive that has kept me going back just for the music.\n\n\nThere are some problems with this game however. Some people will say these aren't problems as such, more personal gripes, but take them however you wish.\n\n1. It's short. Like really short. With no experience whatsoever, my first run was just under 3 hours from start to finish, completing every avaliable mission in the game aside from 'Junebug' which was bugged at the time. Hopefully, more content will be added soon, and the ability to open story creation to the community is an exciting prospect shound it be considered.\n\n2. It's easy. The learning curve is pretty shallow, with a few basic commands covering every action you will be performing. Once you have got launching cracks using the TAB key down to a fine art, you can smash through any security in next to no time.\n\n3. No Upgrade abilities. A key component of every computer interface is the hardware it's connected to, and in a game setting the ability to upgrade and customise that hardware is a given. There is no such system here. The only resource you have is RAM, which is set throughout the game and cannot be improved upon. This does give the game a streamlined feel, but I would still rather have an functioning economy and avenues to explore with my earnings.\n\nOverall, I think Hacknet deserves your time if you enjoy the genre. If you do enjoy this quite esoteric game style, then you've no doubt played the alternatives. On balance, I would say that Onlink, the fan-made re-write of Uplink is the superior game in this category still. It is a longer, more challenging experience. That being said, with expansion and dedication, Hacknet will become the standard by which all other hacking simulation games will be judged. We should all help it get there, and enjoy the rewards when they come.\n\nBuy it.\n","August 24, 2015","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since the game is so different from all the others I've played it really caught my attention.\n\nI found the game short after I started watching a new TV-series, Mr Robot. After the first two episodes I was hooked, so I looked around here on Steam for some new hacking games and suddenly I found this little gem. I've had some experience with running a Linux server, so all the server commands in the game was not so new to me... and made my experience much better.\n\nThe game itself has some bugs when going through your first playthrough, so if you are considering buying this now(Aug.2015), I suggest you look at some guides or the forums to see how to do the first playthrough without any hassle. That was the only downside for me.\n\nThe story in the game isn't all that interesting, but it gives your actions meaning... and that makes the game much more fun! The way the game starts feels like a fresh boot on a new computer(if it had any tutorials tho).\n\nI really hope they add some kind of DLC, because this game have great potential and I would definitly play it!","August 24, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FelicityNatura/recommended/365450/","FelicityNatura","The Fluffy Assassin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FelicityNatura/","542 products in account","UPDATE - A couple of days after I post this review, the developer announces that he patched the bug that made the game impossible to complete. While another bug does exist at present (where if you do not accept the Junebug mission in time, you lose the opportunity to continue with the main story), it is possible to work around this by reloading an old save.\n\nUpon reaching the end of the game, I am absolutely convinced that this game is one of (if not) the best hacking simulators on the market. The final mission in the game is so intense. I had to do it in several parts and my heart was racing each time I started it. There was nothing I could suggest to make the gameplay itself any better. Maybe adding in more missions to give it some replayability and a bit more freedom to go off and hack to your hearts content for good or for evil. However, that could be a DLC pack and can easily be added in. As the game stands, it deserves an 8/10, purely because it's still not perfect in terms of the bugs. However, they should be fixed soon given the dedication the dev has with this game.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nLet me be perfectly clear with this before you read any further. I LOVE Hacknet. It's a fantastic game and is definitely better than Uplink by a mile. The use of real computer commands makes it feel much more realistic and the storyline is pretty awesome to boot. Plus, the time limit you have when a trace counter starts rapidly going down and you're waiting for the password crack to finish so you can intercept the trace creates one heck of an adrenaline rush.\n\nHowever I cannot recommend it as it is now. There is a single bug I have encountered that makes the game impossible to complete. I will try to avoid giving away any spoilers, so this will be a bit vague. Later in game you are required to take on a mission that is part of the main storyline. However, you do not choose when this mission comes to you. It is automatically sent to you in an email and I'm not 100% sure what the criteria is for it appearing. To complete it, you need an .exe file used to crack a specific port which is only available by taking on a side mission. However, this mission is locked and once again, I do not know what the criteria is to unlock it. So I tried to take on the other available missions in an attempt to unlock the one I needed. In order to do this, you must abort the main storyline mission. Aborting a mission means you can NEVER attempt it again, making it impossible to continue with the main storyline. While I discovered it is possible to obtain the .exe without the mission, following an online walkthrough to obtain the information needed to get it instead of getting it in game feels wrong on so many levels, especially since it's deeply hidden within this seemingly permanently locked mission.\n\nSo at this time, I can't recommend it. The game is good, but I haven't been able to finish it because of this bug. The developer seems to be quite willing to take feedback and work on it so if you're reading this, I eagerly await a patch for this game. I can't wait to finish it.","August 20, 2015","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's completely reliant on reading a lot of text, but it fits in with the hacker-working-from-their-terminal kind of narrative the story thrusts you into. The soundtrack is a perfect mix of chill hacker music that helps immerse you into all the commands you're going to be throwing at servers as you attempt to break in. What's particularly interesting is that the game uses several true linux commands for many of the common functions (ls, rm, scp) that really make it feel like a real operating system you're using to break into systems around the internet.\n\nOn the minus side, it's kind of easy to get caught up in rushing through systems without really stopping to poke around. With the threat of active security features giving a sense of urgency to complete my tasks and move on, I can't help but feel like I missed out on files I should have been reading that contacts in the game would reference after I completed objectives and progressed the story. Still, it seems like a rather authentic hacking simulator, making use of that thrilling text-based console the media associates so dearly with hacker-types, and turning it into the backbone of an enjoyable game.","November 26, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having played Uplink and the like, I've fallen in love with this game which is much more realistic and somehow less cumbersome at the same time. A lot of old cliches are simplified down, you get a 99sec timer instead of repetitively bouncing connections around a map. You can remove all log files with a single command instead of running through each one with a log deleter and worrying about leaving suspicious deletions.\n\nSo what replaces all this? The game puts much more emphasis on discovery and exploration, chasing through IRC logs and network maps to find other computers to break into. Missions are scripted, story-based, and much more interesting than Uplink's procedural "delete this, copy that, forge this" procedural mission list.\n\nThere's still breaking past firewalls and proxies, and it's handled the same way as Uplink. UNIX shell knowledge is advised although this would be a great introduction for someone wanting to learn. The command list isn't too big or complex, but it doesn't try to cater to the average bloke-on-the-street either as shown by it's five-minute barebones tutorial.","August 16, 2015","true","44.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed it thoroughly, found the story to be very engaging, and the "think fast" moments were executed well enough for some noticeable pressure to kick in. The music and visuals work *really* well together to deliver a captivating experience.\n\nHowever, Hacknet is not quite at a stage where I'd call it a full release. Right now, it looks more like a competent early access preview. The game is riddled with game-breaking bugs (What's that? You're a completionist and decided to do all quests for one faction before moving on to the next? I'm afraid you just got the storyline out of sync and will find yourself stuck shortly!) and a bit too short to make a strong case for the price tag. The severity of the bugs is somewhat mitigated by the simplicity of the save file format, so if you end up screwing yourself over, you can cheat your way around it.\n\nAll in all, Hacknet is a less advanced but still oh-so-enjoyable Uplink. If you already know Uplink and are looking for more of the same, you'll enjoy Hacknet despite its flaws. Since the game is still being actively patched by the dev, it will hopefully become even better over time.","August 16, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Watch as tiny typing errors cause timing-critical commands and actions to fail, leaving you scrambling to delete ISP log files before a trace catches you.  Make sure you have a replacement "tab" keycap, because it'll wear yours out.  Learn how to type "dc"at moment's notice in a fraction of a second .  [etc]\n\nAs of release, there are still some occasional bugs and missing/broken features.  It's definitely possible to do things "the wrong way" and totally wreck your player profile and game save, making the game unwinnable (or, at worst, unplayable).  For example, the player is currently able to "abandon" storyline missions, which sets your "next_mission" value to "null" and corrupts your save.  Devs have already pushed out two patches and I expect most of it to be fixed pretty soon.  So long as you don't do anything unusual, it shouldn't be an issue.  (There should be no reason to abandon a mission anyway, progression is handled very well.)\n\nHonestly, I can't make a recommendation much stronger than "I bought this game on a whim, then apparently played it for 8 hours straight."","August 16, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But based on a wild experience I've had with it, I felt prompted to write the review.\n\nIf you played Uplink, this is basically an updated version of the game.  Focused on command consoles, IP, file retrieval/removal all in a neat little interface.\n\nIt takes some of the very same queues from Uplink in its story, as you investigate about a hacker named Bit.\n\nPros:\nAuthentic feel\nChallenging yet very satisfying\nOutstanding music\nCons:\nNo money system. The fun part of Uplink was going off on the side and robbing banks wirelessly, and using the money to build an unstoppable system, and simply feeling rewarded for your contracts.\nNo hardware to upgrade.\nTutorials and in-game info isn't always clear. I know its not supposed to hand-hold. But it feels like many commands are left out, as well as some contracts aren't clear about what they want sometimes. The explanation of Shells and Trapping are complete garbage. That needs to be fixed.\nLack of freedom. Uplink had a lot more freedom in becoming a white hat, black hat, or grey hat.  Also had more in the way of non-linear gameplay choices.\nLack of freedom in file editing. In uplink you could change log files, and put someone elses IP in place of your own... Leading to hilarious results as you pin your hacks on someone else.\nWhat's awesome: Unlike Uplink, it gives you a chance at redemption if you fail some missings, and even a chance at revenge.\n\nWhat's not awesome: The very linear gameplay.\n\nOne major letdown : No sandbox mode/options.\n\nOverall: Some glaring bad decisions aside, it is a great game. It tense, it makes you feel like a hacker, it has some great polish, and all this for the price its asking is a no brainer. It's a very decent game, but it COULD have been great.

However, I'm quite sure that you will love every minute of it.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how this game stacks up if you just want another Uplink (I haven't played that particular game), but there are other reviews that focus on that. What I can tell you is that this game is a stylish, sleek, and very impressive hacking simulator. The plot is woven very well into the game, and there are easter eggs and hidden things aplenty. I made it a point to look at every IRC archive on every computer I hacked, because I'd be laughing even while they traced my IP address.\n\nThe game's solution to everything is elegant and new; nothing feels like a tired concept. The game is just long enough to be as impressive as possible with all of its assets.\n\nOn the negative side, the slightly buggy nature of the game is where the indie nature really shows. My first playthrough went well enough until I was hit with a progression-ending bug that I didn't realize until I had actually made progress into a hidden sidequest. From then on, I was a little bit afraid to explore and screw around in case I got hit with another glitch. An option to load from saves wouldn't be amiss, but I'm sure people would use it to save-scum (and unfortunately miss one of Hacknet's coolest features: attempting to forcibly reset your IP address just after a trace has reached your computer, which adds to the game's tension).\n\nSome objectives and game aspects are a little unclear, especially when worded in the game's cool cyber-security lingo (which actually adds to the charm to some extent). For instance, there's only a small sliver of documentation about a considerably-important yet optional feature: setting up proxies as "traps" to be sprung if a trace is about to reach you, which overloads your computer but stops the trace from doing any lasting damage. Experimenting is rendered difficult due to the fear of bugs as above - again, some sort of feature to load a session might help.\n\nHowever, above all, you will find that Hacknet is well worth your time and $10 (or $8 if you buy during this Steam sale), because - be honest with yourself - you're looking into Hacknet to feel like a Hollywood Hacker, and that's exactly what this game makes you feel like.","August 17, 2015","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game surprised me. Spoiler alert for those who wish to keep reading.\n\nI saw the counter attack by the rogue hacker coming, and I thought there would be a way to prevent it. When the game BSODed, I thought "Oh! I guess it'll reset me just before the attack." But no, the game rattled to life again and forced me to think about how to restore my own pc, and that is something to be applauded in a game.\nThen later I tried my hand at the CCC file dump, and lo and behold, I get traced, and suddenly the game gives me about 60 seconds to figure out how to hack my ISP and change my IP, while the trace is represented by your screen turning red. I was stressed and terriefied, and it was so, intense! Seriously, go try it for yourself. :)","August 17, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After hours and hours, I grew tired of it. This game, however, is different. Its user interface is more intuitive and there is much less grinding to get to the story.\n\nThere are some drawbacks, however:\n- the game requires a significant amount of computer resources, somewhat astonishing for a game that mainly lives off its command line interface.\n- Every modern command line interface is better than this one. Tab completion works, but not always. Wildcards work, but only if they're alone on their line.\n\nOn the other hand, this game shows many aspects of real hacking, and the software is much better than most real hacker tools I've seen.

The gameplay is nothing really exciting, it's more of a mechanical matter of using the appropriate tool for each situation (use the SSH cracker to crack open a SSH port, etc.). The only difficulty is when there is a countdown due to the user being "traced", but even there it's not very challenging. Basically you have to learn to type the right commands, and fast.\n\nThe other aspect of gameplay is the investigation you have to lead, unfortunately most of the time there is a lot of handholding and making progress requires very little initiative on your part, just following the lead you're given and using the tools you have at your disposal. Also the main story is quite short, and I'm not feeling much motivation right now to try and find the alleged two other side stories (I completed the one with the pacemaker, which I found was the most gratifying storyline as the game gave you little indication).\n\n(also I got hit by the "main story blocked" bug but managed to unblock it by editing the save file as explained in a forum post)\n\nStill I would like to thank the authors for the Linux port.

The game has some hidden secrets which means an extra partial playthrough is needed if you want all the achievements.\n\nThe challenges never get too frustratingly difficult but can sometimes be tough especially when working against a trace clock.\n\nThe only negative i can really say about theg ame is that the UI could be better if you were allowed to move elements around yourself, the NetMap for example cannot be zoomed or resized and towards the end of the game its gets quite busy with the different nodes so it can be difficult to find were you are and what you need to connect to.\n\nThe game on face value might not appeal to people who are not interested in IT or hacking which is a shame as the game is actually a really good puzzle game outside of the interface/text driven elements.\n\nOverall i have massively enjoyed playing this game, i would love to see the game developed further maybe with additional DLC or even steam workshop integration were we could create our own challenge scenarios.","January 5","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Music is pretty damn good too!\n\nAt first I really liked Hacknet as it feels like what Uplink should be in the modern gaming age.  You get cool looking interfaces, some psuedo-unix commands and maniplulations and a feeling of pressure as you hack your way past traces and logs.  However, thats where it falls apart a little.  You realise that logs are redundant and apart from an active trace when hacking some systems there are no repercussions to breaking log chains.  Except for one scripted event you dont need to worry about the men in black knocking on your door.  It was this attention to detail and consequnce that, in my opinion, gave Uplink its amazing gameplay.  I felt like the game needed that next level of complexity and difficulty to really come of age.\n\nThe major thumbs down however is game breaking bugs.  At time of writing this review there is at least one huge bug that is preventing the game being completed.  An attempt at fixing the bug was done but it did not solve the problem.  Cudos for the Developer at rushing to solve the issue but after one attempted patch there has been no communication on the status of the bug for about a month now.\n\nBottomline.  Its a fun little game but becomes one dimentional and easy once you realise there is no real way to lose apart from letting an active hack trace get you but even that is easily bypassed with one click or command.  The killer at this stage is bugs and more bugs.  I hope the game gets fixed and expanded, it could be a very nice game one day.\n\n\nUPDATE:  The major bug has been fixed and I was able to finish the game.  Thanks to the Dev for fixing that up.\nI have left my recommendation as negatvie which I am sad about as the game is pretty good.  The problem still is that its too easy once you realise there arent any repurcussions to not covering your tracks.  A little more depth would make this game a killer title!","January 5","false","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The "hacking" is typing the same 2-4 commands over and over again.

Even though it says I only have a few mins playtime on my steam profile, I actually played the ♥♥♥♥ out of it offline so yeah I can safely say that this is one of the best hacking games ever!

(My profile would also say that I only have a few mins playtime for Uplink but that's only for the steam version. I actualy played Uplink a lot when I was younger.)\n\nHell, even if you're not into hacking, this game is still one of the best puzzle games out there (although might be a little easy for hardcore puzzle fans, but still fairly enjoyble especially if you already know basic programming/command line magic).","October 17, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It requires you to decide how you're going to complete your contract in steps. Rather than being a puzzle, it's more of a trial & error sort of thing. Beware, though - if you delete any files in this game, the files are gone for good. Unless you start a new game, there is no way of un-deleting files, so be careful.\n\nI've only played this for 3 hours at the current time of writing. I must admit, for a game with little to no graphical stimulation, it's hella fun! It gives you a feeling of accomplishment while teaching you real Linux commands.

It's refreshing during this era of gaming.","August 14, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a little short, and it tookme a few tries at the beginning to feel out what was going on, but once that was done, the game became a fast-paced roller coaster of firewall-cracking, porthacking fun! It's simple enough for a non-programmer to understand, and complex enough for someone with a bit of experience in the (cough) area to have a giggle.","October 12, 2015","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anyways this game is great. Its that simple. If your not sure, you can download an earlier version of the game of IndieDB to try out, or just finish. I definately recommend this newer version, it makes a great game even better.","October 2, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Found the data, copied it to my system, deleted it from theirs, and covered my tracks. Trace timer got to 2 seconds, and I disconnected, in the clear.\n\nBut I wasn't. They started intruding my system, tried to use shells to trap the counterhack. Didn't work. Panicked. Could only remember one command: forkbomb. Typed it in.\n\nImmediately blue screened in the game, and breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nIn-game computer rebooted and I discovered I had deleted a vital .sys file. Now I'm stuck trying to figure out how to recover my OS in the game.\n\n10/10 would blue screen again","October 3, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A little short, but well worth the $9.99 because you can play it again and some things change, but not a whole lot. If there were extra missions or DLC, I'd get that in a heartbeat. Just... get this game. You won't be disappointed.\n\nAlso... 11/10 would get hacked by an NPC again...","October 5, 2015","true","25.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game combines CLI with a visual interface for conveniece which makes it a lot more friendly and visually appealling as a game. Even getting past little challenges felt extremely rewarding for me. I'm no hacker but this game definitely convices you into feeling like you are and with actual IT knowledge seeing things like SSH and FTP ports takes my knowledge and makes it feel just a little more real. HELL YEAH guys. You're doing it right.","October 6, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
