Without light, there is only nothing and I mean nothing, if you try to jump onto a platform that doesn't have light near it, you will fall through the world. If you are swimming and your light floats away, you will drop out of the world without it. Solid walls become jumps when there is no light on them. The object of each of the almost 100 levels is basically to make it to the door at the end. You can pick up lit orbs, you can put lit orbs into carriers that will carry them. This leads to some really interesting platform mechanics, such as moving lights turn into elevators when normally they'd be solid walls. You can put orbs into transporters that will make 2 areas lit instead of 1. There are push boxes, push rollers that will of course roll, lit push boxes, lamps that you can adjust to cast light onto different areas and so on. This is a unique, enjoyable, atmospheric, immerse game, but I have a feeling that once you're done, you're done. They made a really alien world here and the music is awesome and belongs in a suspense drama. After the tutorial levels when the game opens up, the music eases up so its not as intense. Very worth a play through, I own it a few different ways, Steam, GOG, did I mention its free for Playstation Plus members?","July 1, 2013","true","1.4"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","29","33","0","0"

But if you can't see it, It doesn't exist. Walk off into the darkness and fall into oblivion. Wall lamps can be rotated to reveal floors and glowing orbs can be carried to light your way. Some doors need to be unlocked with a key and you can carry only one thing at a time. Appropriate for a game about light and shadow the odd art design is done entirely in black and white.\n\nThe levels were a bit on the easy side, But I enjoyed the light/dark aspect, music and art design. Things are kept at a minimum, Though perhaps too minimal. I think more interesting things could have been done with the games gimmick. There's no story in the game. Just different themes for the three groups of levels. Which is fine as the game is fairly abstract anyway, But filling out the vignettes more would have been nice.","October 13, 2014","true","17.4"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","0"

The way the game works with the shadow/light is pretty cool, and the levels are very well design, some of them has more than one way to be completed or some "secrets", and that's pretty cool.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple: you walk, grab some items, jump and enter the doors. That's it. The little tutorial in the beginning of the game is cool and teach that in a nice and practical way.\n\nThe light/shadow trick is the heart of the game, only the things that are in the light are visible and exists, you can't go out or place any object in the shadow. This is the point of most fun and sometimes frustration.\n\nThe idea of taking a light always with you to know and (literally) make your path is awesome, and very original. It is explored in many ways until the end of the game but there are levels that you will take so much time to you figure what to do and in the last moment you let go that beam of light and it's all lost because the key is gone in the dark.\n\nThe good point is that you can play it for 15 minutes or so, clear one or two levels and return later, because you will not have to learn all over again. It's pretty intuitive.\n\nSo, if you like some puzzles you should definitely try Closure, it is nice, simple, beautiful, original and challenging.","July 6, 2014","true","7.1"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

A puzzle platformer where the puzzles are easy and the platforming is clunky. Spend several minutes on tedious puzzles only to fail a jump and have to restart the entire level. Whoops, that looked solid, but apparently it isn't. Item babysitting is really fun, especially when the entire game is focused around it.\n\nSigh. I can't be nice to this game, there's not much enjoyable about it.\n\nThe "puzzles" in this game are not ever too challenging. The hardest part is figuring out whether or not what you're trying to do is actually possible, since it's often ambiguous. Move speed is slow, jump is barely passable in height. It's not really a very good platforming engine, and the physics are often clunky. There's some decent brainteasers in the game though so I'm not going to pretend it's devoid of real puzzle design, but the tricky stuff is tricky for the wrong reasons. A lot of the puzzles seem to want to make you explore the area a bit and then restart because you did something wrong while exploring. And there's not a lot of variety; lots of the same things over and over with no clever twists on them.\n\nThe game's also way too punishing for how long some of the puzzles go on. Way too easy to jump up onto a box but WHOOPS you forgot to leave your orb next to the box so it plummets into the abyss. Fail a jump you're not sure you can make and WHOOPS back to the start. Losing keys also happens frequently. And the physics lead to some fun times, enjoy your accidentally crushed orb please and thank you. This is especially annoying in the levels that are comprised of several smaller puzzles instead of one big one. Screw up one puzzle and you have to redo all the others too, even though there's no good reason to. The puzzles are already tedious enough without the game forcing you to play them over and over again to figure out everything about them.\n\nIn short, it's not fun. At all.\n\nThe art style is okay, though the lack of color results in everything looking pretty samey after a while. The music's way too overblown for the game and there's far too few different music tracks. The game has too many levels, could've stood to have less considering the lack of variety, it just feels overlong. Especially when there are levels without any puzzle to be found; not kidding. I think this would've been better with a Braid-like rewind system to avoid the tedium of having to replay everything whenever you screw up a puzzle, honestly. Even if it's a "ripoff" that way, well, at least it'd be more fun to play.\n\nNot recommended at all for either puzzle fans or platforming fans, there's far better out there than this.","January 3, 2015","false","7.9"," 31 of 45 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","31","45","0","2"

Everything that doesn't have lights will make you fall down. If you fall  down to the bottom of the screen you will die. That sounds really simple as a mechanic, but is really well executed in the game. With a great look at detail. The thing you have to do is in every level is that you have to open a door to get to the next level. So you  for instance have to find a key or get some object activated to open the door.  You will be really challenged by many of puzzles. Some puzzles also got me really stuck for a while. What I like in the levels are the many different puzzles with new objects. The design and the sounddesign combine well within the game, working well with the game's aesthetics. The only bad thing I can say about the game was that at the third stage of the game the puzzles where strangely enough really easy. When compared to the stages before that. (Maybe it was just me.) Closure is instead of many other puzzle games I experienced, packed with many hours of gameplay. (12 hours )\nClosure is also one of the few games that convinced me to replay some levels over again to get all the collectables. Which is challenging.\n\nIn short: A puzzle game with many hours of play where only anything in the light exists.\n\nIf you are interested you can try the gameplay out on newgrounds:\nhttp://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/480006\n( Also maybe interesting for people who own it because it has different levels )","October 14, 2014","true","14.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"

But how many people really fear the dark, and not just the real or imagined threats it conceals? Certainly anyone who plays Closure, Eyebrow Interactive's wickedly creative indie game. In Closure's world, only what is visible exists-- step on a shadow and you'll fall right off the screen. To light a path through each level, the player must learn to use various arrangements of fixed, rotating, or portable light sources.\n\nThis is two-dimensional platforming like you've never seen before. Carry lamps to preserve the solid ground beneath you. Divide walls into stepping stones by lighting them in segments. Free trapped objects by temporarily eliminating obstructions from reality. Even across 72 levels, these inventive puzzles never fail to surprise.\n\nClosure's spooky, greyscale style perfectly matches its central theme of light and shadow. Artist Jon Schubbe is responsible for the hallucinatory environments, which range from underground mines to deserted carnivals; Chris Rhyne provides the unearthly music and sound effects; and programmer Tyler Glaiel ties it all together. With no unnecessary parts, this game is an articulate, memorable experience.\n\nThe player takes control of three human characters throughout the game, each with their own backstory that is left open to interpretation. The player can also travel to the “hub world,” a land of doors occupied by an arachnid creature with horns and a hollow face, who gives access to the human protagonists. The difficulty ramps up smoothly when the levels are played in consecutive order, but if you get stuck in one world, you can use the hub world to jump to another.\n\nGamers exhausted by the frantic pace of many games will find relief in the methodical progression of Closure. No time limits or point scores here-- not even a Heads-Up Display. The game clearly wants you to share the unhurried pace of the protagonists as you explore their environments. Before proceeding through a level, it is sometimes necessary to study the paths taken by meandering globes of light, which I found to be a relaxing, almost meditative experience. If you're feeling impulsive, however, a fast respawn speed lets you experiment without punishment.\n\nWith Closure, Eyebrow Interactive proves that a game built around a single gameplay mechanic can offer not only an absorbing experience, but a re-playable one as well. To reach the game's many collectable items, players are often required to devise entirely new solutions to familiar puzzles. This results in a more sophisticated difficulty scale than traditional “easy” or “hard” modes, as players can choose their difficulty mid-level. That said, some of the later levels are mind-boggling. But a good challenge is healthy, and in a market saturated with mindless button-mashers, it is good to see a game that encourages thoughtfulness.\n\nTL;DR -- Cool concept with a haunting aesthetic; smart puzzles that award creative solutions.","December 15, 2013","true","3.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

This is pretty much the premise of the game and it is executed to very good effect. Closure is a puzzle platformer in which you are a weird little creature with no face, running about in the dark, and clinging desperately to the light so you don’t fall off into nothingness while you try to map out each level and locate the exit. Oh and then you steal some people’s faces or something and solve light based puzzles in their bodies or whatever.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are pretty clever. In each new zone you start out with some pretty simple puzzles which gradually introduce new elements to you, but towards the end of the zone you’re having to work out some pretty complicated stuff. The way these puzzles work is that walls and floors do not exist in the dark, so you have to position lamps and orbs of light about the place to let you do stuff like pass through a wall and not fall through the floor into the abyss, or maybe ride a spotlight up a wall to the exit. It’s a bit weird at first really, but definitely an innovative twist on the standard puzzle platformer. One thing I really like about Closure as a puzzle platformer is that it doesn’t just delight in killing you for no reason (unlike certain other dark puzzle platformers). Every level has a good sense of logic about it that you could probably work out without dying if you were careful and really thought about it; Closure doesn’t resort to tricking you into dying, that’s just not its style. The fact that Closure puts such a weighting on logic rather than trickery or trial and error (though I did have many trial an error moments trying to get my head around some of the harder puzzles) means that every level completed comes with a strong sense of accomplishment, as opposed to other puzzle platformers which only provide the feeling that you’re glad it’s over before you walk into the next ridiculous trap.\n\nThe music that accompanies the game is top notch and really adds to the atmosphere of the game. Closure even makes use of some Tuban throat singing, which I don’t think I’ve heard in a game before, but it works really well for the existential and slightly creepy theme that Closure has going on.\n\nThere is one thing that I would warn people about with this game, and that is that I encountered a really weird bug playing this game on my new laptop (Windows 8.1 with integrated intel graphics) which caused light to not interact with surfaces properly and made me perpetually fall through the floor and die even though it was lit up – it was a game breaker. I’ve also played this game on a rather old laptop (dedicated graphics, Linux) and on my main PC (dedicated graphics, Windows 7) and on both machines the game runs perfectly. From what I can tell the devs seem pretty active and willing to help resolve any issues but since this problem only affected 1 of my 3 devices and I was so close to finishing when I tried it on my new laptop I didn’t bother getting it sorted out.\n\nI have absolutely no recollection of purchasing Closure, which has added to the mystery of the game for me. I’m just glad I did buy it (if I did buy it) and then happened to stumble across it in my game library. This is truly one of those hidden gem type games and I would definitely recommend it.\n\n8 out of 10, would illuminate.","March 5, 2015","true","17.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Platforms are only solid when a light source is illuminating them, and you manipulate a variety of these to create or remove terrain so you can reach the exit door in each stage. The mechanic is consistent, buta llittle finnicky -- terrain partially lit by orbs tends to create sloped edges or free-floating pixels of floor, which combined with slippery controls will kill you a few times. The most frustrating moments come from falling through a floor or wall after painstakingly setting up platforms in a 1-2 minute stage, because you weren't quite precise enough. But engine quirks come with the territory in indie platformers, so it's easily overlooked.\n\nWhat makes Closure really work is the way the level chains are paced. It has over 100 levels, but cerebral puzzle-solving is broken up by stages that serve only to (literally) illuminate the backstory of the characters whose lives you're navigating. You only realize this as you're moving through it, and realize there's no puzzle beyond carrying the light to the exit and seeing the environment unfold ahead of you. It's a neat trick that made me want to keep playing in a way that an unbroken string of puzzles wouldn't have.\n\nThe game has some rough edges, but it's a very enjoyable playthrough if you like puzzle-platformers. Definitely recommend.","December 9, 2015","true","62.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's not just the innovation, the black-and-white visuals, the puzzles or the uber-simplistic UI. It's that unique feeling that you get to play and experience something special, different, that makes a game not only a form of entertainment, but a form of art.\n\nAnyway, I still like Limbo more, as Limbo felt somehow more alive, more artistic, more personal, and more lyrical (the spiders, the story of the little boy searching for his sister, those evil killer kids, etc.), while Closure is rather liniar (all you got to do is use the light and get to door, in every level). Maybe Limbo can be defined by a mere layman as nothing but an artistically-looking puzzle-platformer, but Closure's original concept of using the light to solve the puzzle is the only thing that remained for me to like after playing a couple (12) levels of this game.\n\nClosure might be unique and innovative, but it's too damn difficult for my short life to waste any time with it. I mean, I couldn't still pass level 2:12 not even after seeing on YouTube how it's done. If I just gave up on my pride and searched for the solution on YouTube, and I still haven't passed that level, then ok, I'm an idiot, but I'm also leaving this game once and forever.","December 17, 2013","false","3.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The entire game is dressed up in that Tim Burton-y style where it tries to be creepy through being weird, or tries to be weird through being creepy, or whatever, but just manages to be irritating. The lowest point for me is any time you have to be underwater, and the normally passable music slows down by 50% and becomes a nuisance.

It's an interesting platforming puzzle game (seems to be a lot of these of late), with a unique mechanic.  It's based entirely on lighting.\n\nMost of the game is shrouded in darkness, and where there is no light, the game acts as though there is nothing.  Therefore you will fall endlessly where there is no light until you die.  This makes from interesting gameplay, as walls can be passed through by simply removing or moving a light source.\n\nThe trick is knowing how to use light effectively to get to the end without falling into darkness.\n\nThis to me has been one of the more challenging of these types of games.  It isn't easy.  It's not necessarily physically difficult, either.

Essentially anywhere that is lit up exists, and anything that isn't lit up, does not. Can be tricky to get your head around the concept, considering at times you know there is a platform there, you just can't see it. If you do however go to make that jump, you will fall to your death.\n\nThe graphics are quite well done, sticking to the black and white theme throughout the game does not make it seem bland in any sense; rather the play of the lights is the main graphical focus.\n\nThe soundtrack was really good, quite symphonic in some areas which really worked for the mood of the game.\n\nNot too sure what the story was about, not even too sure that there was one. At the same time the format of the game does not suggest that there really needs to be one.\n\nThe only two downsides would be the length of the game, taking roughly 7 hours to 100% (some maps will have you stuck for a while, where others you will complete within a minute). The other issue is something that really goes with the genre, and that is the extremely touchy physics. If something is not quite right with the positioning, it can mean restarting the whole level. There also seems to be some inconsistency with the falling of objects, in regards to whether they will bounce badly or simply land flat...\n\nOverall, I would give 8/10.","July 29, 2014","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game has a major graphical glitch. If you have the wrong graphics card parts of the screen will be darker which renders some of the puzzles unsolvable. For example, at the begininng of a level the portion of the floor the character starts off on is missing causing you to fall into the abyss in an endless loop. Or a platform is missing but you don't know that so you wind up spending an unnessecarily long  time trying to solve a puzzle that you didn't realize was glitched. You could go back and tweak the code but that renders the other puzzles unsolvable. Basically you have to back and forth between the code and the game every few levels. It really sucks the fun out of the game because you're never sure if you're failing a level because you did something wrong or because the game is glitched. If you want to play this game I recommend the free flash game instead. It's smaller, shorter, and harder than the Steam verison but at least you'll be able to finish it.\nEdit: I recently picked up Closure again and it works perfectly fine now. I haven't found a news about the game developers patching this bug on the Steam page. (If there is let me know and I'll edit this review). So I don't know if a computer update fixed the problem or the developers patched it or what.\nNow that I've finshed the game I stand by what I said last year. The only new thing I have to add is the puzzles toward the end of each level are frustrating. Not because they're particularly hard but because some puzzles require an annoying level of prescison. I got stuck on puzzles I knew how to solve but I had to do them over and over again because I didn't put a spotlight in the exact position. Or because an object I needed bounced into the abyss becuase the platform it was suppose to land on was slightly too small.\nThat aside it's a fun game and it's worth playing. However, I'm keeping this rating until I get confirmation the glitch was formally fixed. At this point I'm not sure if the game actually works now or if I just got lucky.","December 18, 2014","false","12.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I expect you'll either be excited for another fairly well made entry into one of your favorite genres or you'll bemoan that the indie scene is oversaturated with these types of games. I find myself starting to lean toward the latter.\n\nGenerally Closure's puzzles are cleverly designed with an adequate amount of variation. There are some that were too easy as well as some that, for me, crossed into frustration territory. These aggravating stages were always the longer stages where if you made even one mistake you'd have to start over and redo numerous steps that quickly become tedious. Where the game faltered most for me is that I'd estimate a third of my a little over 7 hours playing the game was spent on these infuriating levels.\n\nAdding to the challenge are 30 collectable moths hidden throughout the game that you'll need to gather all of to get any kind of ending. I got 17 of them during my playthrough then elected to watch the ending on Youtube rather than go back for the remaining 13. I'd suggest skipping the moths unless you are really enjoying the game.\n\nTaking a look at global Steam achievements suggests that the game isn't as widely appealing as its positive reviews would make you believe. Currently, 48.2% of game owners have completed the tutorial stages. Only 8.4% have completed the first 24 levels called "the Factory." In other words, only 17.4% of players who completed the tutorial felt compelled to keep playing to the end of the first of 4 acts. To be fair, you can play the first 3 acts in any order but the way they are laid out in the hub and the general difficulty curve steers you toward playing them in a specific order. 5.1% of players completed "the Hospital," 5.0% of players completed "the Circus" and 3.5% completed the main game. Looking at a few similar games, Braid and LIMBO are much better in these numbers and FEZ is modestly better.\n\nFrom an artistic standpoint Closure does well at creating a creepy, dark ambiance. The visual style is like moving scratchboard art and is quite striking. Unfortunately, due to the light/dark gimmick much of the screen will always be black, making it difficult to get a big picture view of the environments you are in. What story there is is told purely through visuals that can be similarly tough to uncover. Most of the joy you can get out of the story will come from treating it like another puzzle where you try to piece together some meaning. It's hard to praise this aspect of the game as it really doesn't have much discernible depth, but it does dance along the line of being just vague enough to get your imagination going to fill in the details. The music is solid and adds to the atmosphere, even if it gets a bit repetitive at times.\n\n6/10","October 16, 2015","false","8.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

Similar to Braid it is more likely a puzzle game with platformer mechanics.

The level goals are simple. Get to the door! But getting there is going to be one hell of a tricky ride most of the time, as you have to think WAY outside of the box.\n\nYou see, when an object is not lit up, it is as if it ceases to exist. A wall that you can not see because of no light is no longer a wall. It is instead, nothing.\n\nSo picture this. You hold up a lighted orb, and use it to light up the ground beneath you.

Now jump OVER the darkness, onto the next platform. But wait, what happened to the wall? Where did it go?\n\nThat is the whole point of Closure. Wonderfully brilliant gameplay mechanic that makes for a very challenging puzzle mechanic, especially later in the game.

Luckily, the other parts of me, namely the parts that like graphic design and music, told the first part what a bozo it was and I picked up Closure.  Man, am I glad I did.\n\nTwo things surprised me about Closure.  The first was the difficulty.  Now, I may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but I haven't been faced with such difficult puzzles in a long time.  The main mechanic of "light solidifying reality" is absolutely genius, and it often took me quite the sit-down-and-think to wrap my head around some of these puzzles.  I did, sometimes, become quite frustrated at the difficulty, but I never gave in because of the other thing that surprised me.\n\nClosure is one of the most unnerving games I've ever played.  The musical score oozes melancholy, the puzzles are sadistically crafted, and the graphic design perfectly conveys the enormous rift that can stand between hope and despair.  Every aspect of the game adds to this terrifyingly bleak atmosphere that kept me in just the right mood to sit quietly and stew through the brain-benders that the game provides.  It may have been a cheap purchase, but the experiences that Closure has given me will torture me for a long time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reasonance/recommended/72000/","reasonance","Reasonance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reasonance/","1489 products in account","Fast facts: Puzzle platform game in monochrome with emphasis on atmosphere and puzzles, with platforming serving only as the means to an end. Completely devoid of combat. Main mechanic is light source manipulation to create\remove\change environment. Weird yet alluring aesthetics, fitting, well used soundtrack. Good level design. Adequate challenge with final levels being sufficiently rage inducing.\n\nOn the first glance Closure might seem too similar to Limbo, but on closer look they are pretty much nothing alike, besides the genre and the colour scheme.\n\nWhat's this game about? Seeking closure in a world drowning in utter darkness, mostly via carrying light orbs, putting them in devious weirdly working contraptions and turning around lamps, all the while single jumping around and trying to not fall in to whatever lurks Below. For only what is lit is solid, what disappears in darkness is as if it was never there.\n\nIt is NOT a fast paced, twitch based platform game. Speed doesn't matter most of the time. Instead it is a slow, deliberate traversal of small levels coated in darkness. It's stumbling in the darkness, looking for the way out and yet revealing grotesque architecture instead. It's often doing things in obnoxiously roundabout way, and yet it's even greater for all of it.\n\nMore often than not the journey requires of you to formulate a plan of action beforehand, as any mistake might cause the level to be unwinnable, forcing you to restart [thankfully instantly available under R \ X360 Back \ Select].\nIt demands perfect execution of the whole sequence of actions without any major errors, for there are no checkpoints.\n\nFor those curious there's around 80 levels, divided into 4 groups, though some of them are more of a setpiece to advance the textless story of the game and to strengthen the already strong atmosphere.\nOn the other hand, quite substantial part of the levels have additional, harder objective to accomplish in the form of Silver Moths, after acquiring which one needs to still finish the level normally via the door, which can wreck the normal solution rather beautifully. Those moths are required for total completion of the game, their presence is well marked by appropriate sound cues, and, after certain point, marked in the level lobby.\n\nOnly minor gripe I've had with the game is a bit too high sensitivity of the analog stick on my well-worn 360 controller, which resulted in slippery movement - switching to different gamepad [DirectInput one, working from the get go] eliminated that completely. The game also controls finely using keyboard, all the tutorial prompts are actually only for the keyboard.\n\nSo, should you be patient enough, I can only wholeheartedly recommend for you to seek Closure.","March 16, 2014","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Awesome in theory, messy in practice." Yes, as you might assume from that, this isn't going to be the kindest of reviews (at least as far as the puzzle design goes). You've no doubt been drawn to this game by its honestly quite impressive art style and maybe it's really excellent sound design (I'll talk about this later in the review, so don't worry), but this is unfortunately one of those cases in which the game is tons of style, with not much substance.\n\nThe main gimmick of this game is that you have a stage which is almost entirely shrouded in darkness. Through various means you can shine light on the level to reveal portions of the stage. However, if a light is shining on a platform, not all of that platform may be revealed. For example, there is a puzzle relatively early on that shows you that you can indeed go through what was once solid wall through good placement of the light source. These light sources that I'm referring to come in a few different shapes: glowing orbs which emit radial light and can be embedded in things like blocks and wheels, lamps which emit linear light, and supernatural phenomena that light up for no reason and with no prior indication whenever light shines on wherever they may be because they feel like it. Fortunately, the last light source isn't used too often, but it can be a little irksome.\n\nThe lack of light for all of these puzzles does great for the atmosphere, but it gradually becomes remarkably tedious to deal with, especially with stages that involve swimming. Typically, the first thing you do whenever you enter a stage is you pick up a light orb and you fumble about the stage effectively memorizing where things are; after which you continue to solve the puzzle. This brings me to one of my bigger complaints about this game. This is somewhat of a personal design philosophy as far as puzzle games go, but I believe that puzzles should have inherent, easy repeatability, so that the game becomes more of a factor of thought rather than a factor of skill or precision. While there are some levels that recognize this and have a pretty "locked-in" way of solving them, a lot of levels in this game have a degree of imprecision in which the puzzle becomes more of an issue of item placement than an issue of problem solving (oh man, my solution worked but I placed the light orb two pixels too short so I miss the jump/render the puzzle unsolvable).\n\nThis issue becomes even further compounded whenever the biggest issue of this game is revealed: every time you die, you restart the puzzle. This may not be so bad, but when puzzles later on take anywhere from four to five minutes to solve, the whole thing falls apart very quickly. In fact, I'll readily admit to not completing this game because of 4-6, a level that is pretty much a checklist of things that I really don't like about the puzzle design ethos of this game: imprecise jumps, loads of item juggling (oh yeah, that's another problem with this game: there's a LOT of item juggling), having to cycle through the stage multiple times to solve it, and finally, the lack of ability to see the entire stage so that you can end up screwing yourself over without having all the information. I can definitely say that this is a game that I won't be replaying anytime soon (if ever). There are some neat ideas in there, but they get reused so often (seriously, how many times am I gonna have to do the light elevator?) that they just become tedious. Not a game to be played for gameplay. "Closure! Awesome in theory, messy in practice." 4/10.\n\nStory: I'm... not sure about this one, to be perfectly honest. As you might expect, the game is written in a very surreaistic way, somewhat akin to Limbo but not necessarily as laden with symbolism. It goes through three different characters, but I'm not sure if they're necessarily related, and if they are, what purpose they play in the story. The ending doesn't really help as far as explanation goes. I dunno; I'll probably be thinking about this one for a day or two after writing this review. Because I'm just that dang unsure as to what's going on with the story, I won't bother rating it. Who knows; maybe the game's story is a Dadaist fever dream and any attempts to read into the story are inherently futile? It's... probably not, but there's always that possibility!\n\nGraphics: Well, it's obvious where 45% of the game's effort went. It's another one of those instances in which I'm sure I don't need to tell you how great this game looks. I just wish the stages weren't so damned dark so that I could appreciate all the effort put into the backgrounds. Ah well. What I can tell you is that this game fullscreened to my native resolution on launch without any intervention, which is a big plus in my books. There isn't much else as far as graphical settings go, but there don't need to be; this is a 2D sprite-based game with, at most, some pixel shading. As long as you've got some sort of pixel shader capability, you should be able to run this game no problems. So yeah, this one's pretty cut and dry. It looks and runs spectacularly. 5/5.\n\nSound: Well, it's obvious where the other 45% of the game's effort went. No seriously, DAT SOUNDTRACK. The soundtrack is absolutely perfect for this game; it's loud and chaotic at times while other times being more ominous and brooding. Both extremes are captured fantastically, and I'd easily recommend picking up the soundtrack for this game. As far as its presence in the gameplay experience, it can get a little tiresome hearing the same song or two on loop throughout the entire area, but the first time hearing that song... so good. The sound design is fantastic as well. It's just too bad that the puzzle design takes you right out of that atmosphere. 5/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 4/0/5/5; cumulative score of 7.0/10. On an objective level, I give this game a Recommended (if the score is greater than 5, then recommended; if the score is less than 5, not recommended; if it's a tie, use the discretion of "will I ever play this again?"). On a subjective level, I can't recommend it, and will instead recommend just getting the soundtrack and watching a Let's Play of it.","October 17, 2014","true","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game plays in a dark environment with very few light sources: if you can see the ground you can walk on it, but if you cannot see the ground you'll fall through. Same with walls: if you see the wall it will block your progress. Remove the light, and you can just walk through them -- just make sure you can still see the floor you want to walk on... you can't see the gravity, but it's there :-)\n\nThe entire game builds on this concept. You move around and play with the light sources that the level gives you to reach the exit. There are no enemies to kill, no quests to complete, no equipment to find. You appear on one spot in the level, and you have to reach (and possibly unlock) the exit door.\n\nThe game has no story or voice acting, you just complete one level after the other for no apparent reason. Nonetheless, it worked out for me. The graphics is using a monochrome drawing look that works very well with the light/dark theme game, and I liked the music too.\n\nThere are a few tutorial levels, three reasonably distinct level sets with 24 levels each, and another set of 10 levels after you complete the normal ones. Or 11 levels if you count the last one -- it requires you to have found all secrets in the normal levels, but once that's the case it's a trivially easy level and merely lets you walk to the end credits.\n\nA slightly annoying part is when the game introduces something new and shows you the button to press -- it will show you the keyboard key. Even if you play with the gamepad.\n","February 8, 2014","true","20.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/72000/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","Closure is a minimalistic puzzle/platformer game centered around the use of light to illuminate the level; any part of the level which is not illuminated does not exist.\n\nStory\n\nThere is no story.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay is very simple and yet has pretty good variety in terms of puzzles nonetheless. You can pick things up, drop them, push crates and barrels around, and adjust the angle of lights you can touch. These are all the mechanics in the game, and yet they’re used in a pretty reasonable variety of ways. The game starts off very simple, but soon starts throwing some reasonably clever puzzles at the player.\nThe central mechanic of the game is light – light illuminates the level. Any portion of the level which is not illuminated does not exist, meaning that you can fall through it – potentially to your death, if you fall off the bottom of the screen. In addition to constantly-illuminated places (which are usually small patches here and there in a level), there are adjustable lights which throw light onto various parts of the levels; mirrors which can reflect light and behave similarly to the adjustable lights, save that they must be illuminated by some external light source; and small light globes which the player can carry around, pick up, and drop. There are crates and barrels, some of which have light orbs stuck inside them, and fixtures where you can place a light orb which causes something to happen – usually, either additional orbs appear in other fixtures, or the fixture moves around on a fixed track, allowing the player to navigate through the level on a moving platform of light.\nAll of these things combine to create a pretty solid variety of puzzles, with a few other mechanics thrown in for good measure. There is a fixed gun which can shoot out light orbs (destroying them) or targets (which open up doors). There are barrels and crates which can be pushed onto buttons to open doors. And there is water, which can be swum around in, but which light orbs, when not held in your hands, float instead of sink. There are keys in a few levels which unlock the final door – often a bit challenging because you can only carry one thing at a time, and you often need to carry around a light orb to navigate the levels well – and other doors which are opened by either casting light on certain parts of the level or putting light orbs in all the fixtures around the door.\nAlmost all of the stages are pretty short, with only the final states in the game requiring more than a few minutes to complete – and even there, most of the time spent completing them is figuring out what you’re doing, not actually doing it.\nOn the whole, the game’s central mechanic is quite clever and creates a solid variety of puzzles, and in the end of the game, ten remix type levels test your ability to use all of the other things you’ve learned in concert.\nThere are also 30 moths distributed throughout the game which serve as collectables; these glowing moths are sometimes hidden very cleverly, but also sometimes feel as though they’re hidden “cheaply”, such as off the side of a stage where there is only one spot you can walk off the side of the screen and actually have the screen scroll.\nIf the game has any weakness in its physics, it is in the crates and barrels. The barrels mostly behave predictably, but the crates, being squares, frequently will fall at an angle, which can send them tumbling out of the light and off into the darkness, causing you to fail the stage sometimes through no real fault of your own. Sometimes this felt extremely inconsistent, which was frustrating when the goal was to do the same thing over and over again every time I restarted the level. This is particularly frustrating in the final level, where you must solve four puzzles to defeat the level, and two of them involve crates, either of which can go plunging off into the darkness with little warning. Given that this is by far the longest stage in the game, it is rather annoying.\nOverall, the game’s gameplay is decent enough, but the game never feels like it ever goes above and beyond – it knows what it is, and it does what it wants to do, but it never makes me feel like it is anything more than a simple puzzle platformer.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics are simple but visually appealing, and look fine in high resolution.\n\nFinal Summary\n\nAll in all, there’s nothing really wrong with Closure, but there’s nothing overwhelmingly right about it either. The game is simple, it works well enough, the puzzles are reasonably creative and make use of the game’s mechanics in interesting ways, and the graphics are reasonably appealing to the eye. All that being said, the game never really impresses the player or goes above and beyond; it is what it is, and what it is competent, but not great or spectacular. It is merely a decent game with interesting ideas. At about six hours to complete 100%, it is not an unreasonably long game and does not wear out its welcome, but your life will not be forever incomplete if you never experience it.","December 3, 2014","false","7.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

And while that is annoying I discovered that if you spam the Steam Screenshot key (F12) the menu blinks for half a second, so that helps.\n\nOnce you enter the game there are a ton of interesting puzzles, but I was unable to play 3/4 of them because of a severe bug that kept occuring.\nThis game is unique because of how things only exist when they are illuminated by light. Whenever you enter a level an orb of light drops right where you spawn. That light creates the ground beneath you, and you can pick it up to start to explore.\nThe bug that keeps occuring is that the orb of light drops but it doesn't create any ground until it has already fallen through. The ground disappears because the light has fallen off the screen and then you instantly drop to your death. You'll just keep respawning and dying endlessly. Closing the game and reopening it didn't help, and I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but the same bugs kept happening.\n\nThis game is pretty fun when it works, and it seems like there are plenty of people not having problems... but I only recommend getting this if it's on a great sale, and try to get a refund if you encounter the serious bugs that I did.","August 6, 2015","false","1.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But that's not enough for me to recommend it.\n\nI didn't like the pacing of the game. The game is split into very distinct levels, only a few levels have any sort of story. Most of the time it's just puzzle after puzzle which makes the game feel slow and like you're not getting anywhere.\n\nLevels lack checkpoints, meaning if you mess up, everything is reset. Very irritating.\n\n------\n\nIf you just want to try out the game mechanic and play some puzzles you may enjoy it.\nIf you want anything more than that, look elsewhere.","December 19, 2014","false","4.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

While im not a big fan of puzzle games, when i saw this game, i just had the urge to try it out. It looked interesting to say the least.  The game is all about using light to move around and solve puzzles. Wall in your way? move the light a little to the left, making the wall dissapear, but also making a hole you must jump over.  Light is everything in this game, it makes the ceilings, floors and walls....most things. And all puzzles have something to do with it.\n\nGive this one a try, but be warned, its not very easy, and requires quite a bit of brain power.\n\nPeace (ง ͡° ᴥ͡°)ง","February 7, 2015","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Any foreground immobile objects that are lit up, would be viable platforms, while any hidden in the darkness are considered as non-existent. This allows you to walk through walls if they are shrouded in darkness. This ability is double edge sword, as you can also fall through floors mistakenly if they are also in the dark.\n\nThe level design also gives subtle hints to lead the player to hidden rooms, or paths to take to solve the puzzle. Hidden items, such as the moth would always emit a loud enough noise when the player approaches closer.\nAs for aesthetics, the each world design tells a little story with the environment and level design. There are no spoken dialog or anything to read in the game, so everything is just interpreted by the player. None of the levels felt repetitive, and it kept introducing new elements to keep me interested as I progressed through the worlds.\n\nFor the most part, the standard puzzles, such as just reaching the door, doesn’t require finesse as most of the layout locks all the moveable objects so you can’t mess up. However, some of the puzzles for getting the hidden moths requires a bit more control. Most notable on the Circus level 18.","October 15, 2014","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Being a physics-based game, the puzzles can be a bit finicky in their solution and execution. Also, the puzzles can sometimes pull focus away from the atmosphere. Spend too much time in a puzzle, and you lose focus on the larger narrative. Spend too much time in a world, and the music can get grating.

Because some lights are to dark they won't light up the platforms as intended.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FirstUtterance/recommended/72000/","FirstUtterance","FirstUtterance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FirstUtterance/","571 products in account","Ah, puzzle platformers. Or, specifically, 2D puzzle platformers. In the wake of major successes like Braid, Limbo and Fez many indie devs out there have dipped their toes in the market with creations of their own. Nowadays it seems though everyone is sick of them. Indeed it has become an oversaturated market. Such games are easy enough to create: make a 2D platformer, then center it entirely around one mechanic/gimmick used to solve the puzzle-based levels. The success games like these have seen combined with the ease in making them means we've seen a LOT of them. Is this a bad thing? Like anything else there's the chaff you have to sift through to get to the wheat. I don't care how saturated a genre market is as long as there's quality being produced from it, and as someone who does like these sort of games I have had enjoyable times spent with them (I personally prefer classic, Mario Bros.-style platformers myself but these have their place). Closure is definitely one of the more intriguing entries in the genre, with a spooky atmosphere in a genuinely strange world, great art design and an amazingly clever mechanic that turns the concept of light and darkness on its head as Portal did with the concept of spatial dimensions.\n\nThe idea is simple: if there is no light, it doesn't exist. Getting used to this can be tricky at first. As you crawl along the ground with your lighted orb, put it down and move over the other side and fall to your death it's then you'll realize that light is more important than simply allowing you to see things easier.\n\nAs for story, I... honestly don't know. There does appear to be some semblance of one, but if there is it is told abstractly, without words, much like Limbo, only Limbo was much more straightforward. All I know is, you're some crab-like thing scuttling along and entering doors to areas where you transform into different characters like, say, a young girl (no, none of these characters have special abilities or anything) and using your wits to make it through the exit doors of each level. There are also these star-like objects you can collect in these levels which are tricky to get but unlock a special ending if you do get them all.\n\nThis game definitely makes the most out of its mechanic. Every possible way you could think of to utilize the idea that you can stand on something lit up but can walk/fall through darkness, it's probably in this game. Not every level is consistently solid, some are more annoying/tedious than others (especially when trying to collect every star) but overall they get it right. But puzzles aside, the environments are worthy of mention too. Many feature details you have to go out of your way to find, like a level where if you're at the right spot you see a terrifying clown-monster face looking at you on the wall. And the ending... I won't give it away (not that I understand what happens anyway) but it gives you a much better opportunity to see some background details, which yes, include more terrifying clowns, despite the more ambiguously uplifting music playing. In other words, this is no half-♥♥♥♥♥ game that was made here.\n\nOh yeah, the music, how is it? Hit or miss, to be honest, but the hits are quite solid. The main hub area with its sinister tribal-like sounds remains the most memorable.\n\nSo now it's 2014 and the game is now two years old, around the 2D puzzle platformer "boom" and before its collapse a year later. It seems as though indie devs have moved on from the genre to other territories. Not sure exactly what... space sims, roguelites, maybe? Well in any case this is a standout in its genre and if you don't already have it go ahead and give a try regardless of what your genre preferences may be.","December 23, 2012","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Any foreground immobile objects that are lit up, would be viable platforms, while any hidden in the darkness are considered as non-existent. This allows you to walk through walls if they are shrouded in darkness. This ability is double edge sword, as you can also fall through floors mistakenly if they are also in the dark.\n\nThe level design also gives subtle hints to lead the player to hidden rooms, or paths to take to solve the puzzle. Hidden items, such as the moth would always emit a loud enough noise when the player approaches closer.\nAs for aesthetics, the each world design tells a little story with the environment and level design. There are no spoken dialog or anything to read in the game, so everything is just interpreted by the player. None of the levels felt repetitive, and it kept introducing new elements to keep me interested as I progressed through the worlds.\n\nFor the most part, the standard puzzles, such as just reaching the door, doesn’t require finesse as most of the layout locks all the moveable objects so you can’t mess up. However, some of the puzzles for getting the hidden moths requires a bit more control. Most notable on the Circus level 18.","October 15, 2014","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gimmick with light is really clever and it's nicely executed. In short if it's not lit, it doesn't exist. So to stand on something you either have to lit it with a lamp or carry some source of light. Game looks awesome and has a nice mysterious feeling to itself which works great for a game in which you have to explore level to find a solution because you only see a part of it. Puzzle itselfs were pretty logical, the learning curve didn't have any bumps and you used what you learned before (apart from one level which is hinting at wrong solution on purpose to mislead you). Most of the puzzles can be solved in matter of minutes just by experimenting and exploring what works, so it's not one of those puzzle games where you have to take a break when you see next level.

Clinging first to the little orb dropped at your feet, then finding wonder through the first door you're directed through. The narrative is unveiled through the glimpses of the eerie environments of the three main characters you play as. Each level dives a little deeper into the unfortunate happenings of these souls while building hand over hand on the platforming elements it continues to introduce.\n\nThe music and the background sounds add many layers to the experience. While you may never encounter an enemy, the game makes you believe that sometimes, stepping outside of the light may lead to a worse fate than falling to oblivion.\n\nCharismatic is most appropriate to describe the art in Closure. It could have been a teenagers doodle in a textbook years before being layered and shadowed. It could have been Jhonen Vasques inspired. Whatever the origin, it's unique. It's pleasing. And it's refreshing.\n\nEnough of my prattle, go find closure for yourself, poor soul.","October 1, 2014","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are three sections, each comprised of 24 puzzles.  They start off easy and gradually get harder as you progress.  Once you solve all 60 puzzles, there is a final section, consisting of 10 puzzles + one bonus puzzle if you collected all of the moths.  The last 10 puzzles truly ramp up the difficulty, requiring you to master all of what you have learned thus far.  The art style and music for this game are both well done.  The tight controls are also worth mentioning, as any game (especially one that requires platforming) should have.  The frustration factor can be high with this game.  You can complete 99% of a puzzle, only to have one tiny misstep cause you start over from square one.  It pushes you to keep trying in order to get it right.  The only real negative flaw I feel this game suffers from are the rag doll physics.

Visually it's quite simple, creepy but still appealing. Audio... not much variety and quite repetitive. Finally the gameplay is where I am most torn. In it's essence, Closure is a pretty solid game. The rules of it's universe are simple to understand and the puzzles are challenging. Yet the problem is I feel frustrated while playing. I often find myself solving the puzzle mentally but unable to carry it out mechanically. Perhaps that is part of what makes this game unique. However some of the controls are undoubtedly awkward and unnatural, subtracting from the whole experience. Sometimes when close to a ladder the character suddenly latches on for dear life, unwilling to let go. Moreoever, I still cannot figure how to move the lamps properly, as the controls seem to invert every half second.\nIn summary, it is a unique and challenging puzzle/platformer, but seems somewhat lacking.

A brief flicker of candlelight in an otherwise dark and scary world of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ indie games.\n\nClosure is delightful. It's simple, interesting, unexpectedly good in its mechanics, and ultimately rewarding by challenge. It is unrelenting in its expectations and complexity but forgiving in depth and challenge.\n\nIt's admittedly hard to describe. It's an indie puzzle platformer true enough but somehow more than that.\n\nIt's worth playing, if only for the mind teaser challenges it offers. But, quite frankly, worth playing for much more than that. Give it a go.","October 5, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The catch here is that this rat is required to use light to make the walls and floors appear and disappear to achieve that finish point. Nice film noir art style. Decent music. Some really good puzzles. Pretty unique game mechanic that feels slightly unpolished during a few rare moments but overall works very well. Overall a nice short-to-medium length game. A person can get 10-15 hours of game play out of it, which could be perfect for someone like me who has a large library of games to get through. And I got it on sale for $2.49. All these facts made the game more than worth the purchase for me. 8/10 for a solid puzzle game experience.","October 2, 2015","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unique puzzler that is over before you grow bored of it, would say it is the perfect length. The art and atmosphere are awesome.\n\nMy only dislike is that some of the puzzles require too precise of positioning. You will find that often times you have figured out the solution, but fail the puzzle having to restart because your positioning was a hair off and you lose a key item or die. This furstrated me to the point of putting down the game a couple times. A couple of times it also made me think I had not found the solution due to this problem.\n\nStill overall, I recommend the game to anyone who wants a fairly short, unique puzzler.","June 22, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are three sections, each comprised of 24 puzzles.  They start off easy and gradually get harder as you progress.  Once you solve all 60 puzzles, there is a final section, consisting of 10 puzzles + one bonus puzzle if you collected all of the moths.  The last 10 puzzles truly ramp up the difficulty, requiring you to master all of what you have learned thus far.  The art style and music for this game are both well done.  The tight controls are also worth mentioning, as any game (especially one that requires platforming) should have.  The frustration factor can be high with this game.  You can complete 99% of a puzzle, only to have one tiny misstep cause you start over from square one.  It pushes you to keep trying in order to get it right.  The only real negative flaw I feel this game suffers from are the rag doll physics.  You will sometimes need to let a crate or key fall, only to have them bounce as if made of rubber.","August 29, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If a game brings forth something that I haven't seen, I've gonna play the game a lot. That's the biggest drawing point of this game - it takes the generic puzzle platformer and changes the mechanics of the game.\n\nThat being said, it has a lot of virtually soul-crushing moments, whether it's doing something blatantly wrong or 99% right with the 1% throwing you off the edge of a cliff. But that's what you buy a puzzle platformer like this for. You buy it for the mental and physical test, with willpower on top of it. This isn't Mario (farm 99 lives and blaze through most levels) and this isn't just a puzzle game.\n\nIt's a great package of art, music (startling moments of sound in game), and gameplay. It's short, but I'd definitely rank it pretty high on my list of games.\n\nTLDR: If you like puzzle platformers, this game is worth it.","January 8","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
