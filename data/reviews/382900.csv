The great music and story are still here, so that is good. Even the downgraded graphics I don't mind too much. But the interface... man, the interface is garbage. It was designed for a tablet, and they didn't bother changing it for a PC player. There are some tweaks you can make to it, but all the options are bad. Also, the max resolution is 1360x768, so you can't even play it at 1080, much less anything higher. There's aslo bad background tearing when you move. This is really unacceptable, it would have been better to put the SNES or GBA version in an emulator. I love this game, but this version is just not well done. Spend a little time on a game this well loved SquareEnix, don't put out this trash, your devoted fanbase deserves better.\n\nEdit on 12/23:\n\nI have reached a point in the game where I can not progress. The game crashes everytime a specific event happens. I have tried it on multiple machines, exact same crash. This game is UNPLAYABLE.\n\nEdit on 1/1:\n\nA work around has been found for the crash. Turns out its a bug present even in the iOS version that they never bothered to fix. Just another reason to not support trashy ports.","December 16, 2015","false","13.4"," 1,030 of 1,157 people (89%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","89","030","1","19","23"

Put this to wide screen and it looks hideous with the sides being black bars.

This is a very poor port that needed some extra time before it was released.\n\nFirst thing I noticed, HORRIBLE sound quality, like nails on a chalkboard. The original SNES version did not suffer from this problem.  Even worse is the ridiculously low max resolution.  How is it that a new update is released that allows people to play KOTOR 2 at 1920 by 1080, and this game is locked at a maximum of 1368 by 768?  This is not 2004, Square, this is embarrasing.\n\nIn my opinion, the graphics are an upgrade compared to the SNES version, but on the whole, this is a techincal flop.  Also has an issue screen tearing, which Square claims can be fixed with anti aliasing, but this option is not available at release.  I knew I really should have taken a wait and see approach, given Square's hit and miss history with past ports, but come on, this is freaking Final Fantasy 6.  Should have been a no brainer.  If they just took a direct port of the SNES version, and changed absolutely nothing, it would have been worth the price.  Sadly, they chose to make a bad port of a bad port of a mobile version.  Fans have been worried that was the lazy approach, and they were absolutely right.\n\nThe one good thing is there is no additional hidden DRM like they tried to sneak past gamers on past ports.  The ability to rebind keyboard controls is also a good thing.  However, it's just not enough to recommend this game.  Such a shame, but it looks like it's back to using an emulator for me if I ever want to experience this masterpiece as it was meant to be seen.\n\nThis is the very first game where I requested a refund.  If these issues are fixed, I'll buy it again.  Until then, praise be to Gabe Newell for introducing the refund policy to protect us from games such as this overpriced, lazy, and frankly embarrasing downgrade of a classic.","December 16, 2015","false","0.7"," 749 of 871 people (86%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","86","749","871","13","24"

I also love when it did not crash when my snes controller was plugged in my Snes, or my PS1 controller plugged into my PS1, hell it was even great when my gameboy advance SP worked without crashing using the controller that was built into it.\n\nThis mobile version port however does crash when I use my controller.  The menus are all greatly enlarged as set for a mobile device.  Since I cant use a controller I was stuck with 2 options, bind my keys in a really uncomfortable way so I could play and name my chars without having random extra chars like Lockea, or deal with the names being screwed up.  I would have the third option if it didnt crash when my controller was connected.\n\nI am surely going to get some flak for this and I understand why.  If you have the snes ps1 gba or the game on ur Wii like I do with all of the above, just play that.

However this port, remake, whatever you want to call it, is the worst way to experience it.\n\n- Initially had always-online DRM. This has been patched out; good. But should never have happened in the first place.\n\n- The already abysmal mobile interface is ported wholesale to PC with little optimization, with buttons and scroll bars in place of more thoughtful, less obtrusive, less eyesore layouts. It's as bad on the eyes as it is on the hands, and the one good idea behind the battle UI -- everyone's menus on screen at once, Chrono Trigger style -- suffers as a result.\n\n- Dancing Mad, the final battle theme, used to smoothly transition between its various tiers as the fight progressed. Now, each tier of music just abruptly interrupts the last. In a game known for its stellar music, no less.\n\n- The in-game "Album," which acts as the story log/chronicle, has events that are missable (#26, if you don't nab it in the World of Balance), and doesn't respect your decisions and party choices (it acts as though Mog was first met in the World of Ruin; the screenshots mostly just show Celes, Edgar, Sabin, and Setzer despite who you tend to use).\n\n- The multiplayer feature present in the SNES original is gone.\n\n- Configuring controls must be done through a launcher; the in-game options menu has no controller configuration. And if you accidentally unplug or power down your controller during play, well, that's a restart.\n\n- Various long-known, long-outstanding bugs from the original SNES release are still present. Though admittedly, some are addressed, such as Physical Evade actually working and Cyan's Bushido (SwdTech) actually working as intended (pick a skill, he charges as other party members act).\n\n- If you set your movement to WASD, the keys register as part of a new character's name when you try to save, preventing you from naming ANYONE their default name.\n\n- Intermittent freezing/crashing, sometimes from controllers, sometimes not.\n\n- Ill-thought-out visual remastering, with mismatching styles and overall poor quality, including a mixed bag of new sprites and hilariously bad spell effects (compare Flare Star and Forsaken/Goner to their originals, or even the poor GBA versions...).\n\nSquare Enix has said they charge more for their games because they deliver better experiences. Many of their games prove this rhetoric thoroughly false, though perhaps none more so than the Steam version of Final Fantasy 6.\n\nVery disappointing.","December 16, 2015","false","54.5"," 509 of 609 people (84%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","84","509","609","9","15"

I have played this on the PS1 and I have played this on the PS Vita. All those versions are great (PS1 and Vita having some slow processing points, but meh).\n\nHow anyone can look at the character models in this game and say... 'Wow, they fit right in this world.' is beyond me. They look horrible on the background, their colors do -NOT- match it and look alien to it. Not only that but they look so bad in general. That in itself is an insult to such a great game.\n\nI dont like or dislike how the combat has changed (with the rising combat menus to display who's turn it is by rising and reaching it's maximum height)... it's just the menu is cutoff and you have to scroll to reach some of the options and it seems to unnecessarily take up screen space and the character portrait displayed in that menu is the same ugly model and not a smaller well done portrait art of the character similar to what you see in the dialogue windows.\n\nThe return to title option when saving is just a bad design decision. The exit game option should easily be found in the menu where you have status, magic, etc etc.\n\nThe resolution settings should include the standard 1080p.\n\nKeyboard and controller bindings in the launcher should be separated from one another. Simple and easily understood with detail.\n\nI so want to recommend this, but I cant. Not like this. It's a phone port, so obviously a phone port. The original game 9/10, this phone port 3/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/382900/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","For me, the year of 1995 was also the year of Final Fantasy 6. It was, next to Secret of Mana, one of the only SNES games I ever owned, so I put a lot of time into that classic RPG. At one point I even had a 100% complete game. Everyone was at level 99, I found all of the items, collected every last one of those stupid rages, and even idled long enough for the game-save to read "99:99" on the clock. Not even a week later I discovered the "Relm-sketch" bug, received thousands of items, and accidentally wiped that 100+ hour save from the cart.\n\nBut I'm not here to wax nostalgic, I'm here to figure out why this game can only garner a mostly-positive review average on Steam. FF6 is one of the most-beloved entries in the franchise, and it would take a total dummkopf to botch a port of a 20 year-old game, but here we are. I would have preferred to discuss FF6, its successes and its faults, and offer up a thorough analysis. However, everything takes a backseat to Square-enix's incompetence.\n\nThe presentation in FF6 Steam/IOS is a huge step backwards from the SNES game. The new sprites aren't just ugly, they clash with the scenery, and create visuals that are shoddy and inconsistent. The special-effects also look worse, and some spells (like "Ultima") lose all of their splendor. The music is fine, but the sound-effects are truly awful. I can't understand it. One of the most effective sounds in FF6 is the sound of wind-blowing. This version screws that up. The wind never sounds right, and takes away from the mood of every scene. There's some other stuff in here that I won't even qualify with the word "sound", they're just noises.\n\nFF6 is a landmark entry in the franchise, due to its many inspired set-pieces. However, when the presentation is botched, many of these scenes lose their impact. For example, I've noticed a number of cuts in the Opera sequence. The music will stop at the wrong time, or the transitions don't quite gel. Even if you never played FF6 before, you'll notice when these things happen, because it's just that jarring.\n\nTo its credit, this version of FF6 includes a couple improvements and additions to the design of the game. For one, the entire battle-party is no longer required to sit and wait, while Cyan charges for his sword-skills. Unfortunately, Cyan is still a bum and a failure to his wife and son. The auto-battle is pretty nice, especially if you have Sabin in the party, since it also auto-performs his last blitz. Not much was done with the underlying mechanics of the game though, which is nice I suppose. Magic still dominates, and it's a little too easy to craft practically invincible god-characters, but that's part of what I like about FF6.\n\nThe one major issue of this port, the one that crawls under my skin and chews away at the bone, are all of the hitches. Every time I enter a place in FF6, whether it's a house, the next floor of a dungeon, or any other location, there is an ever-so-brief pause. Locke, Celes, or whoever will stop for a fraction of a second, and then resume walking. This happens no matter what direction I'm holding the control pad in, and it's so minor but also completely absurd. Somebody at Square-enix signed off on this, and it drives me up the wall.\n\nSeveral years ago I had to get a new transmission for my old car. The repairs were over $2,000. Yeah, I got taken for a ride that day. While it was nice having a car again, whenever I moved the gear-selector from park to drive, the car would make this loud "THUNK" noise, like it was about to crap its metallic innards all over my drive-way. Despite this alarming noise, I was able to drive the car for another four or so years without incident. Still, every single time I heard that noise I thought "I paid $2,000 for this...."\nWhile I only paid $8 for this version of FF6, I get that all too painful "I paid $8 for this..." feeling, every single godforsaken time Sabin or Edgar stops for an impossibly brief moment.\n\nWhat else can I say that hasn't already been covered in other reviews?\n\n- Lack of decent resolution support.\n- The interface is junk.\n- Bugs (I haven't finished the Cultist's Tower yet because I keep getting stuck at the top)\n\nI often wonder why Squre-Enix has never considered developing a serious revamp of FF6. While this game is a classic, it could stand to benefit from some fresh game ideas or a few new twists. FF4 recieved a pretty significant overhaul for its DS/IOS/Steam versions and it was really cool. Then again, wouldn't revamping the game require effort? That sounds like way too much work for S-E.\n\nActually, I take that back. S-E puts a lot of effort into their ports, they're just terribly misguided as to what makes for an enjoyable experience. I'd rather see S-E provide an emulator and just charge people for roms. Heck, they could even be like Sega and offer workshop support, so gamers can use rom-hacks. Granted, as you've probably heard, this has opened a Pandora's box. Some of the stuff uploaded to the Sega Genesis Collection workshop has been pretty dire, and even illegal (masking unsupported games as "rom-hacks" for supported games). But that's the deal with Pandora's box, it contains all of the evils of the world, but it also contains hope.\n\nThere's no hope to be found in this edition of FF6.","May 3","false","25.5"," 124 of 147 people (84%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","84","124","147","12","2"

I am reviewing more from the "played it a hundred times" crowd.\n\nI can look past the graphics (although let's call a spade a spade and say they are not well received.\n\nI have two much larger (in my mind) issues. First, the lesser of the two, is why after saving the default action is to return to the title; you have to hit cancel rather than hitting ok one more time. I have gone to the main title more than a few times unintentionally. Similarly, there are several poor usability decisions in the port which makes it very frustrating. For example, hitting left or right in battle doesn't change the target of the attacks (for example, casting cure on an enemy). Instead, it moves to the next ready character.\n\nHowever, my bigger disappointment is the obvious half-attempt of the achievements. I was most excited about the achievements since it gave a challenge in FFV and FFVII, something to build towards. The achievements in FFVI are awful. Nothing related to hidden or optional espers, nothing about maxing characters, nothing really other than stuff that would happen otherwise. Sure, the Gogo and Shadow's Dreams achievements are optional, but I was hoping for more. Since I have already beaten this game on every platform it came out on (I remember opening it on SNES; good times), I was really hoping for the extra achievements to round out the experience.

This version of Final Fantasy 6 is the best version ever made, and I'm going to talk about the downfall of the other versions to explain why.\n\nThe Super Nintendo and Game Boy Advance versions were extremely heavily censored.  The Game Boy Advance version was so heavily censored that even the Japanese version was censored.  The Playstation 1 version, however, was completely uncensored, but more on that in a moment.\n\nThe Game Boy Advance version had inferior sound quality due to hardware limitations.  Now, sure, a bunch of people are just all like "just mod the rom lol" but that doesn't remove the art and content censorship.  So, what about the Playstation 1 version that just wasn't censored?  Well, sure, if you want to play that one, just realize it has loading times of roughly 5 seconds to get in and out of battle. 5 seconds happens to be a very long time when it happens twice every 12-15 steps and all you can do is stare at a blank screen.  Additionally, the Playstation 1 version has none of the extra content in the GBA version.  To boot, the SNES version is completely full of bugs, although vanish/doom was awesome, the other stuff wasn't.\n\nSo, where does that leave us, if the other versions have all these problems?  Well, the mobile version is uncensored, and contains all of the GBA extras, and has lightning speed loading times.  It's the port that has it all.\n\n"But the graphics are terrible!"\nThey are actually not.  The map backgrounds are the same as the Super Nintendo version, with a little anti aliasing applied.  The character sprites, which are complained about the most, are high definition versions of the old Super Nintendo versions.  They look out of place, because they're walking around on these SNES tier graphics, but the art on the characters is fairly good.  If you give it a chance, you'll probably get used to it.  But much of the other art was vastly improved.  All of the battle backgrounds were redone in high definition, and the character profiles were also redone with actual CG shading and sharp, crisp lines.  Take a look:\nhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/404560514027523123/CA9B8EA1F09C0FB15C4DF1422BD05702E58A3622/\nhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/404560514027522879/3149B06B01D4C9F54C77AF15DFC87D697CF1EF10/\n"The translation is terrible!"\nIt is not the translation you grew up with, that's for sure, but translation of Japanese games was notoriously inaccurate at the time.  The new translation has a bit more exposition and is a bit more verborse because they can afford to be.  It's also the one you'd have to play with anyway if you played the GBA version.\nRemember the sequel to this game had a guy who are sick.\n"The music is terrible, too!"\nOnce again, it is simply not.  The music uses the same instruments and arrangement as the SNES version, they are simply run through a different, more advanced mixer.  The result is a clearer, more articulate and harmonic musical score that is completely faithful to the original.  This game didn't ruin the music any more than, for example, the audio touch ups of the various music from Ace Attorney on the DS (for those of you who played the GBA originals) and 3DS\nBut someone modded the original score into the game if you want to listen to the old 16-bit chiptunes anyway.\nThe sound effects were also greatly enhanced and no longer sound like variations of running fingers through gravel\n"Mobile ports are awful!"\nSome are.  But not this one.  It even runs at 60 FPS, although this is predominantly only noticeable with the menus, and text/map scrolling as the sprites only have as many frames of animation as they were made with.\n"There is just no reason to play this game when I can play (version) instead."\nThis version has many new features and enhancements.  The biggest among these are the following.\nAutobattle - for backtracking through weaker enemies, uncursing the cursed shield, grinding veldt enemies, and generally reducing tedium against enemies that otherwise would never be able to hurt you anyway. Especially if you're vanished in an all physical area.  It's also useful in the beginning of the game where you generally do not actually have options better than "mash attack"\nCyan's Bushido skill now allows you to select a number, and he'll charge it up while you can command other characters instead of having to sit there with nothing to do. Cyan had pretty good stats, but his ability was pretty bad in previous versions.  This update makes him really good.\nSabin's Blitz can be canceled without wasting his turn.\n"So why don't you just go play the mobile version?"\nBecause Square Enix is allergic to supporting controllers in their mobile games.\nIt's easier to show off my achievements here, anyway.\nAlso works with Steam Cloud\nAlso less of a hassle to put up screenshots and videos, if that's your thing.\nPlaying on a phone is uncomfortable, playing on a tablet is unwieldy.  Some mobile games are very good, but they make poor gaming devices themselves. I thought the nVidia Shield portable had the right idea, hope they make another one, but that's a discussion for a different place and time.\nAt the end of the day, I cannot recommend this version enough. I assure you, you can and will adjust to the new character graphics and enhanced audio.  The menus, text, and other sprites are all visually appealing and anti aliased.  The graphics all align great.  Everything is great.  This is going to be the definitive version of this game for a very long time, unless they manage to make an even better version for a new platform later.","December 16, 2015","true","276.1"," 414 of 641 people (65%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","65","414","641","34","41"

If that wasn't bad enough, the sprites have been put through a nasty blur filter that makes them look smeared with vaseline.  Now, many environments are smooth to the point they look molded from cheap plastic.\n\nAs for gameplay, the entire menu interface has been replaced with giant buttons designed for touch screen.  The standard battle option sees each character have a tab that rises out of the bottom of the screen instead of the ATB bar of the original.  There is a tabbed option that isn't much better.

Originally released on the SNES under the title Final Fantasy III, it still holds up to this day as one of the best RPG experiences fans of the genre can have. Despite some minor subjective graphical complaints and some very annoying bugs, I consider the Steam release as one of the better ones. The GBA version was great, but the audio quality and poor translation brought it down. It added some extra content as well, which is also present in the Steam version (The Dragon's Den and Soul Shrine).\n\nGameplay\n==========\nThere's not much to say here, but I will anyway. Final Fantasy VI is your standard, turn-based RPG, but with a few twists. This entry in the series introduces the Magicite System. When you progress far enough in the story (early on, don't worry), you are given access to powerful stones called Magicite. When equipped, Magicite allows your characters to learn spells at varying rates and also summon powerful creatures known as Espers. Different Magicites teach different spells, and some teach them faster than others. After battles, you earn Magic Points. Once you get enough Magic Points towards a spell (multiplied by the spell's teach rate), you learn the spell. Once a character learns a spell from a Magicite, they keep it permanently. Magicite also grant small bonuses when the character levels up, such as a +1 bonus to Strength, or even a +50% bonus to HP. As long as you teach your characters some basic spells (like Cure, Protect, Haste, Fire, Blizzard, etc), you shouldn't have too much trouble with most fights. Bosses and other challenges will require a bit more strategy.\n\nFinal Fantasy VI features 14 recruitable characters, and they are all very unique. Each one has a special ability or command that only they can use. Just to give a few examples: Celes has an ability called Runic, which allows her to absorb spells cast at the party through her sword and restore her MP. Think of it as a magic lightning rod. Shadow can throw consumable items and weapons for big damage. Sabin utilizes special Blitz techniques that require specific inputs that feel like commands from a fighting game. Edgar has a small handful of powerful Tools with different effects. Truly excelling at this game requires you to find the few characters you like that mesh well together. Any party setup works, but some are much better than others.\n\nWhile each character has their own unique traits, they also have their flaws. I'd like to point out that one big flaw with the character Cyan in the original release was actually fixed in this version! Before, when using his Bushido technique, a bar would appear and fill up to wherever you stopped it. When this occured, you could not do anything else while the bar filled up, effectively grinding your battle to a halt until it finished. In this version, you choose which technique you want the bar to go up to and the game will put that bar over Cyan's status window in the background and allow you to continue inputting commands for other characters until it fills up! As for the other characters, there was nothing that big, but others are not so obvious. For example, you'd think Sabin's Blitz techniques would get stronger as his Strength stat went higher, right? WRONG, most of them are modified by his Magic stat! Umaro, a character you get late in the game, is 100% uncontrollable. One specifical character CANNOT equip Magicite and their stats are fairly average, so you are stuck relying on equipment to make them useable. Despite these flaws, the flexibility of the Magicite System and the number of characters you can use allows you to build your party however you like, so that you can either bolster strengths or cover weaknesses.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nThe biggest complaints I've seen over this version of the game are the sprites and how it has a certain filter used on them to makes them look blurry. One can simply look at the screenshots on the Store Page and decide if they like them or not before buying if this is your main concern (it shouldn't be >.>). I found them to be quite detailed, and stuck to the original designs of the characters pretty well. After you play for a few hours, you'll most likely forget all about the complaints and just enjoy the game.\n\nAnother complaint is the battle UI. While this version was originally released on iOS, and it worked there, it's somewhat odd on PC. There are a couple of options in the Config menu to help alleviate these complaints, just find the setting that works best for you.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe soundtrack of a game is one of the first things I tend to get attached to while playing. Final Fantasy VI has a stellar soundtrack, and every track fits perfectly to each situation. Many of the tracks from this game are considered to be iconic for the entire gaming industry, such as Terra's Theme. Nobuo Uematsu has always been considered a legend for his work on Final Fantasy, and his masterful arrangements of these tunes are nothing less than perfection. Here is a favorite of mine:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq_Qf3mVnCo\n\nPerformance\n==========\nMy PC specs are on my profile. I did not experience any problems running this game. No frame drops or anything. There have been complaints about save files being lost, game-breaking glitches, and other things, but I did not experience any of these. Hopefully you won't either!\n\nI played the entire game using a Logitech F310 controller with no problem. Plugged it in and it worked wonderfully.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nOne of the most memorable and iconic RPGs ever created has made it's way to Steam and it definitely holds up all these years later. Fans of the genre and of Final Fantasy would be hard-pressed to find a better classic RPG experience anywhere. If you are an RPG fan and have not played this gem, I urge you to do so!\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/5j2exuHT5DY\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","January 9","true","27.1"," 71 of 115 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","71","115","0","3"

Regrettably, I'm disappointed by my purchase. The game is locked at 1368x768, the controls are horribly mapped out (backspace to go backwards in a menu, and to enter it is escape?), and the sound is worse than on a SNES. How could Square not include the abilities to map out your own controls? They did the bare minimum for this release to get it running on Windows.\n\nDo yourself a favor and buy the game on GBA, which I still consider to be the best version of the game.

I would say sure, ok, maybe this isn't so bad... but the menus for techniques and magic completely cover the battle screen making it impossible to know where or what you are targeting. Let alone follow the battle and see what's attacking whom and what's going on in general. At least give me the option to change it BACK to the classic battle lay out Square.\n\nGraphics:\nYeah, im complaining about Super Nintendo style graphics, Square again tried to fix something that wasn't broken. The character sprites and various world sprites have been redone into what I can only describe as lifeless obominations that cleary do not belong. The shading is terrible and there is no blend what so ever with the rest of the world, which was left with the original sprite set. This hideous clash makes it look like Disney got a hold of this game and tasked some intern with making this version solely for the Nintendo DS, with its hideous menu systems. It looks and feels like it is ment for a touch screen and NOT in ANYWAY for a console of anykind.\n\nGameplay:\nNow, when ever you walk up to an NPC or Object that a player can interact with, a hidious red chat bubble with a (!) appears above your head. All the hidden items around the world... void... Everytime you approach an NPC BIG FAT RED (!) blaring in your face. Maybe on some strange foreign planet there are players who don't know that you can interact with NPC's and that they need to know where every "hidden" thing is at all times cause they are so incompetent that they can't PUSH THE INTERACT BUTTON ON A CHEST... but this is Earth and I don't know about you but I feel like Square is calling me A) Dumb, B) Incompetent, C) Assuming I am a child or have the mental capacity of a 3 year old, or D) All of the Above...\n\nIf you are thinking of getting this game, cause the story IS very good, then download the SNES cartridge and play the original... this game is a SHAM of what the game was. SHAM! SHAMMITTY SHAM SHAM!!!... SHAM! or download Anthologies version for the Play Station and see all the pretty cutscenes.\n\nThanks Square, for ruining my favorite Final Fantasy and driving your company further into the dirt.","December 23, 2015","false","6.1"," 42 of 65 people (65%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","65","42","65","6","0"

Second is the sprites they don't look right luckily we have a great modding community working on this as I speak to make this game the definitive version of FF 6.\n\nSo even though this game has problems the modding community will fix most of them and has fixed some already.

This is a port.  A likely modifiable port with controller support, but a port nonetheless.  If you buy it expecting any different, it's kinda' on your head.  Do not complain after.  You've read the description, saw the video on the product page and the screenshots, you KNOW what you're getting.  Stahp.\n\nAAHT!  I see you!\nDamn kids.

He is superior to Sephiroth, and this is a chance for FF7 fanboys to find out why.  No Oedipus complex here, kiddies!  IMHO it even has the best equipment system, and DEFINITELY the best magic system - which it should, given the entire basis of the game is magic.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to buy the game, but just as many not to.  Overall, the game ITSELF - the very essence of what makes Final Fantasy VI what it is - is a definite "YES".  This is a classic game and well worth it... and even if not in opinions of past owners/players right now, it soon will be.  Hell, buy it just to mod YOURSELF if you've the talent!  Work with those in the community who can make it a thing that happens. Otherwise, look forward to that time and keep that potential in mind before you judge this book by its awkwardly-HDified cover.","December 30, 2015","true","22.4"," 53 of 91 people (58%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","58","53","91","7","0"

Very much, yes.\n\nWith that out of the way, here is my rather long diatribe regarding what I consider to be the greatest JRPG of all time.\n\nThe history - and ups and downs - of the Final Fantasy series are an extremely convoluted matter and would require quite a lot longer than I have in this review to completely discuss. That being said, I've generally found that four games in the series are routinely listed as people's favorites: IV, VI, VII, and X. There is an argument to be made for each of those as being the "best in the series" but it usually comes down to which one has the greatest nostalgic value for whomever is making said argument.\n\nI've been playing videogame RPGs since Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Treasure of Tarmin on the Mattel Intellivision in around 1984, so I have nostalia for virtually the entire catalogue of Squaresoft's flagship series. Why, then, do I gravitate so strongly toward Final Fantasy VI..?\n\nMany of today's more modern-era gamers might find this difficult to understand but back in the days of 8-or-16-bit consoles, graphics were rarely more than "functional" and only served to let you have something to follow with your eyes. RPGs in particular often suffered from a lack of high-end graphics and - seeing as they tend to be very story heavy - the telling of the tale largely had to be left up to the dialogue translator and the musical composer.\n\nFeel free to Google the name "Ted Woolsey" some time if you want to find out what problems tended to befall game translation during those dark times. Mercifully, the more recent versions of the game have been retranslated, but the issue I wish to discuss is the game's soundtrack.\n\nFinal Fantasy VI has what is unquestionably the single greatest score ever composed for a videogame; whatever opinion you have to the contrary is meaningless. Nobuo Uematsu wrote an opera for a Super Nintendo game. I cannot stress enough how important and unusual that is. Taken out of context every track is a masterpiece, but combined with the game itself, they become an epic poem that builds the tapestry surrounding one of the greatest casts of characters in gaming history.\n\nThe gameplay itself is nothing particularly remarkable as JRPGs go and the plot is essentially the one you find in Star Wars but with a steam-punk flavor added to it. No. The most wholy amazing facet of the game is undoubtedly the cast of characters that you set out on the journey with.\n\nIf you do not genuinely feel doubt, sadness, anger, regret, exultation, and pity over the course of the travails of the game, then I would be very much surprised. Each character has a heartwrenching event, memory, or doubt to overcome and while not everything ends happily - and in any great story it shouldn't - they all break the shackles that are holding them back by the time you face off against Kefka at the end of the world.\n\nThe long-and-the-short of it is that Final Fantasy VI is absolutely brilliant and if the "enhanced" sprites are what's holding you back from playing the game, then you're not the sort of person that deserves to play it in the first place.","May 17","true","118.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

This release on Steam is a port of the Mobile version, a version that was based off of the GBA version. This means that you can get all of the extra content that the GBA had to offer (Dragon's Den, Soul Shrine), should you wish to play that stuff. Unfortunately, they also brought over all of the known bugs in the GBA version - and seemed to have added a new one with your character randomly being invisble in town, with no NPCs spawning.\n\nWhile this version does have it's share of issues - inconsistencies with the font choices, previously mentioned bugs - it is still not a bad version to play overall. While I would recommend playing the SNES or GBA versions over it, I still give this version a recommend as it by far not unplayable. If anything, it IS better than the PSX version.

My particular issue is a bug that is not fixable at present in which the Font shows up only as funky shaped blocks.  It is COMPLETELY unreadable.  In a game where reading is critical, that means the game is not even remotely playable.  I have tried multiple solutions, including various font replacement mods, reinstalls, verifying game cache... you name it, I've tried it.  What it boils down to for me is: I wasted my money on this port, and then spent too long trying to troubleshoot the issue and it is no longer refundable.  I cant play it, its just taking up space on my pc.  If you want to know what problems other people are dealing with, just read the other reviews - its all there!  Unfortunately, I was never able to play it enough to verify if any of these other issues are even that severe, or if its just people being dramatic about not liking the sprites.\n\nIn summary, if you have another way to play FFVI than this port - DO IT, 999999/10 I recommend playing the game.\n\nHowever, if this port is your attempt to try the game for the first time, do yourself a favor and find a GBA emulator instead.  Experiencing an amazing game through a broken port is just going to ruin it for you.","April 6","false","1.7"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

It's been said many times, how FF6 one of the best video games ever made and I agree 100 percent, it is a masterpiece, period. I'm glad that I got to play it on this version too, it made the game much more enjoyable for me. I wouldn't recommend putting too much stock in the negative reviews for the FF6 steam version. The only problem I had with this version was the UI, so understood that complaint at first but when I saw the old UI I changed my mind immediately. Even if this new one isn't perfect, I still think it's much better than the old one and I definitely got used to the new one after almost 60 hours of gameplay.\n\nThe new graphics remind me of pokemon games on the DS and like them better than the original graphics but it's personal preference, the UI was weird at first but grew on me later, the auto battle button speeds up combat and repeats your previous actions you chose in the last turn making the game feel much less grindy and speeds up the pace of the game without cheapening it. The help button which reminds you what to do if you forgot was also a good feature. Some may say it's "casualizing" the game but I'd disagree, they still kept the spirit of the game alive and the help button only reminded you of your objective, it didn't directly tell you what to do at all times like a lazy quest marker might do. I'm also thankful that they kept the music the exact same, leaving it completely untouched was the right thing to do.\n\nAnd that's all that needs to be said really. It's easily a 10/10 game for me, I'd recommend it to anyone, even to people who don't usually like JRPGs. If you enjoy Role Playing Games in general, this game is worth your time.","May 31","true","82.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It is not a perfect port but I still feel it's the definitive version of the game to me.\n\nI think the world environments, battle backgrounds, spell effects, and static enemy sprites are absolutely gorgeous.  The character sprites overshadow that to many people, but for me the beauty of the other quite faithfully remade tiles and sprites makes up for that.  On the topic of those character sprites, people have a great many terrible things to say about them. I was among them, but I admit I got used to them. The graphics revamp was definitely not "lazy" though, even if those sprites stick out like a sore thumb.  It would have been far easier for them to use the old art assets than remake everything (and most of the remade assets are faithful enhancements of the original art in higher resolution).\n\nOn the topic of the UI there are postives and negatives, but I feel the positives outweigh the negatives.  When it comes to the main menu, overall the information is presented in a much more efficient format than the original SNES game.  For example the equipment and relics menus are one menu now, which makes much more sense.  Overall I feel it has saved me more time than not, and I feel the main menus are definitely superior.  I wish the controller input mirrored the SNES version, but the controls work fine for what they are.  I can't figure out how to scroll through pages quickly or manually sort items, which are the only two annoyances I have with the main menu system.\n\nFor the battle menu, originally I slammed the rising portrait mode.  There is an alternate mode too, but I find I like the default better.  In the end it turns out to control very much like Chrono Trigger's battle menu, in which you can easily move between each character's commands on screen.  The down side is the menu entries are large enough you must scroll unless you choose one of the other menu formats (which do not show all four characters' menus at once).  I would have liked the option for ATB bars on the side, but overall I feel the battle menu system allows choosing which character to use much smoother than the original system.  The character Cyan's special ability has been made a little more useful than the original and now lets him charge his move on his own after you select it, rather than forcing you to sit idle with the other characters while waiting.  Auto-battle is more accurately "repeat the last commands used." This includes the character Sabin's Blitz command, for example.  It is the built in enhanced equivalent of the "hold down the button to keep pressing what you did last" that worked in the SNES version, and can be toggled on and off with a button.\n\nI like the redone script.  There are many scenes that feel like they go on longer than they did in the SNES version, showing how much had to be cut to fit on the limited cartridge space.  Some more classic lines from the first English translation are still retained though, which was a nice touch in my opinion.  Some of the more puzzling lines also make more sense now as well.\n\nIn rare very specific instances the music does have issues.  In one particular scene in which the music should keep pace with the rest of the scene, it loses syncrhonization.  That is in the Opera House, and only affects the first scene.  In one portion of the game train sound effects are missing from the original version.  I have read that smooth transitions are missing in another portion: the change of phases in the final battle.  I could swear that one of the cinematic scenes was much shorter than in the original: that is the flight to the Empire's continent in the airship.  Strangely, the opening music doesn't sound quite right, but everything else in the game does sound just like the SNES version including the sound effects.\n\nI used a mod to remove the bilinear filtering, but if I could not it would not have ruined the experience.  I just think it's better without it.\n\nThe game was modified to drop the always-online DRM, instead using Steam's normal protection.  I think that was a very smart decision on Square Enix's part, and I applaud the fact the feedback criticizing that was taken seriously.  While for Final Fantasy V the game seems to have been completely unsupported after release, including for critical bugs and others easily reproduced, this game seems to have been treated better.  The overall experience seems smooth to me and I like most of the graphical changes.  It includes the GBA's added bonus featuers without the horrible GBA music.\n\nThis is not perfect, but that is not what I am gauging this recommendation on.  This is overall the definitive version of the game in my opinion and I recommend it to both fans of the original and others curious to try it.\n\n(A note on Final Fantasy V, the game is still great and works fine for most, but I could not excuse SE's complete ignoring of its critical bugs.  It doesn't have a single patch. This game was treated much better.)","February 5","true","92.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

FF6 was one of my favorite games and it's kind of hard to make a bad game from its story.  I first played this game in Final Fantasy Anthology where they had actual 3D CGI clips made by professional animators.\n\nThe Bad:  Seriously, what happened?!  They had a better remake of this game a decade ago.  The timed boxes floating up and down in the battle system look cheesy and are annoying (granted maybe they were trying to turn it into a phone app).  It looks like an amateur designer just found the gradient tool for the first time.  The character illustrations look like they were done by a first year college student with an obsession for anime.   I don't think Square took this remake seriously at all and figured they'd throw it as a cheap side project to their college interns.  I'm just mind blown how they go from such a revolutionary remake 10 years ago when it was even bundled with another Final Fantasy game (also better rendered), but fail to copy paste that work into the PC version.  My mind is blown.  This game is almost offensive to the franchise.","March 7","false","11.6"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","3"

Seems like a small change, but it actually makes Cyan a much better character.\nThe interface is, in my opinion, better than the original version of the game.

This is the point that people seem to bring up the most when they give this game a negative review. While I'm not a big fan of them, it doesn't seem like that big of a deal to me, and it doesn't really detract from the overall quality of the game.\nOccasionally the game would lock up for a few seconds. While annoying, this bug was rare and didn't cause any actual harm to the game.\nLimited display options, basically the only thing that you can change is the resolution. That being said, I don't really feel like a lot of options are necessary for a game like this.\nHonestly, I'm not really sure why people hate on this version of the game so much. Other than the one bug I mentioned in my list of Cons, I never had any technical issues playing the game. I played the original FF6 first and loved it, but I still feel like the steam version improves upon it in virtually every way.

Frankly if they where going to put this much effort into the port than they might as well have released it along side of the iOS version that came out years ago. So here is what is keeping me from reccomending this game.\nCons:\n-Game claims to have controller support, however after launching the game, just pressing a button on your controller causes the game to crash.\n-Very low resolution support\n-ZERO improvements from the tablet version of the game. Very sad and dissapointing.\n-The changes to the script suck compared to the original.\n\nIf Square Enix can even just fix the controller support issue I will gladly change this game to a reccomended buy...however if pressing a single button causes the game to crash, I can't reccomend it no matter how timeless or amazing the game might be.","December 18, 2015","false","5.7"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","14","27","0","0"

While the sprites were dreadful but the environments and enemies beautiful in V, everything is bland in this one.  The game is also not fully controller-compatible, and far from friendly.  The prompts are for keyboards with no option to change them, and you can't see what the controls do anywhere so you have no choice but to try every button and see what they do.  Like in V, the walking speed is much slower than in other remakes but in this one, the controls are both stiff and laggy.  Seriously, there's a huge input delay that makes navigating the menus are a huge hassle.  This port also introduces some new bugs somehow, like inventory items disappearing, healing spells not casting right and other equally gamebreaking things.  Finally, the graphics settings are severely limited and the game only runs right on 1280x720; any other resolution will cause severe screen tearing and graphical glitches.\n\nJust do yourself a favor and stick with the GBA version, it's vastly superior in every single aspect except audio, where this one is slightly better.","January 14","false","2.4"," 21 of 41 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","21","41","2","0"

I don't consider myself a purist and the odd choice of character sprites that seem to clash with the other artwork of the game do not bother me that much. Fundamental changes aren't made to the gameplay with exception to the UI but it's easy to get used to on the default setting (tab settings are made for touch screens) and the auto fight feature more than makes up for that. It also keeps the original SNES music but it's been tweaked to give it a higher quality sound (this is a good thing).\n\nPeople have reported problems with controllers not working and the game not supporting some HD resolutions. I've had no problems using my rock candy xbox 360 controller and since I use an old 19 inch CRT monitor, HD resolutions are lost on me anyway.\n\nAs a gamer who grew up with the original I'm not going to say this game is better but I can understand where people who hate on it are coming from.

The colors are bad. How bad? It looks like they drew cartoon versons of the cast then upped the contrast too much. People are not well defined and start to blend into the background. The only reason they don't is the terrible colors used to draw them. They do not fit the asthetics of the game at all. Then there is the battle system. Every single thing is rushed. It feels like the battles are running at 1.5x speed and thats not using the speed up button. The old bars that tell you when a person is about to have an action are gone. Now your menue slowly rises into view and then stops when its your turn. FOr a touchscreen device this would be a neat thing. This is not a phone I'm playing on! It mucks up the fights. I payed it for 7 min. That all I could stand. I wanted to love this game, but square just squated out a phone port of one of the greatest JRPGs ever. There is very little love to this title. Whatever company they hired to reproduce this game obviously had no clue as to what they were doing. I won't go on my rant, but I'll finish by saying there is no way in hell I will pay $15 for a game that looks like it came from the Google Play store for $1.99.","December 17, 2015","false","0.1"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","13","27","0","0"

I experienced some serious screen tearing etc. Other users are reporting issues with always on DRM. I can't in all honesty recommend what feels like a really lazy port of the mobile version. If you insist on playing this version of FF6, I suggest playing it on android. If you prefer the full experience with the pixel graphics, feel free to play any of the other rereleases. If you've never played Final Fantasy 6 and have a stable connection and can tolerate the odd resolution choices, feel free to pickup this version.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/382900/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","Final Fantasy VI was the last installment of the Super Nintendo/Super Famicom era of Final Fantasy titles. Released originally back in 1994, the Steam version of this fantastic classic has gone through some upgrades to make the game more suitable for the current era. It should be noted that this version is a mobile port, and was original released for iOS and Android.\n\nThe short and sweet of Final Fantasy VI is this: There was a war, called the War of the Magi, that left the earth in shambles. Magic was all but gone, but you play as a girl named Terra who is able to use magic. Turns out she's half Esper, which are what the summons are called in this entry. The world has been rebuilt over hundreds of years since the war, and it's done so in a pretty steam punk fashion. The main villain, Kefka, dresses almost like a clown and is seeking to destroy the world yet again; of course, it's up to you to stop him. Lots of stuff happens, people die, and you learn the backstory for almost every character that you come across; there are 14 in total, all with their own unique quirks and personality.\n\nThe main issue that I have with this entry into the Final Fantasy Franchise is that while the story starts off promising and interesting, it devolves overtime to many of the characters lamenting over past mistakes and grievances. There's little in the way of plot development with Kefka other than knowing he wants to destroy everything, and that he's a deceptive little jerk. Of course, the characters at the end finally snap out of their morose attitude when they make amends with the past, but a good chunk of the game is based around this; and by that, I would say roughly 10 hours of the 30 hour story. The story also turns into the typical "good vs evil" and "lesson learning" stuff that RPGs are made of.\n\nWhile some allies are incredibly memorable, in my personal opinion I do not find them as noteworthy as those in Final Fantasy IV, and the same can be said for the overall plot, which I found generic by the middle of the game; but of course, people will disagree on this. In fact, I will go as far to say that whichever Final Fantasy is your favorite is ultimately up to you, there is no right or wrong answer here. They're all great in their own right, and they appeal to everyone differently. As far as pre-disc era Final Fantasy games are concerned, I'd say that VI is my second favorite. It's still an incredible classic, with amazing atmosphere, wonderful artwork, and an astonishing soundtrack.\n\nFinal Fantasy VI is one of, if not THE most, linear titles of the pre-disc era. In this redone version, the linear path is even further enhanced by the in-game tip/hint system that directs you where to go and what to do next; although it's rarely ever difficult to figure it out. The game itself is also quite easy at the beginning, but it takes on a weird difficulty curve once you get to the World of Ruin. Many people complain about the hero sprites and how they "look stupid", but honestly it didn't bother me even once during the 30+ hours that I played this title. I was too busy admiring the outstanding monsters and captivating landscapes. Not to mention, the gothic-styled soundtrack stands out in this version better than ever before. I personally think that this is a wonderful reboot, in every aspect imaginable; despite it being a mobile port, that fact is really irrelevant.\n\nSo the long and short of it, Final Fantasy VI is an amazing classic that has gotten a wicked upgrade for the current era. The soundtrack is immersive, the sprite detail in the monsters and backgrounds is stunningly captivating, and almost everything has been recreated to a perfect T. The people complaining about the hero sprites are undoubtedly shallow. If it bothers you that much, there are mods available. Don't let it deter you from an awesome RPG experience. The fact that this is a mobile port means nothing, it runs at a solid 60 FPS and there are no crash issues, glitches, or bugs in my experience.

The artwork is somewhat worse than it deserves to be and the menus are absolutely horrifying. But even these things can't get in the way of the fantastic, timeless writing of these memorable characters, clever story segments, one of the best combat systems the genre has ever had and quite possibly one of the best soundtracks video games have ever seen.","March 20","true","39.8"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/princehamlet/recommended/382900/","princehamlet","PrinceHamlet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/princehamlet/","255 products in account","Ok let's start positive. This at it's core, despite any changes cosmetically, is still FFVI. There are issues and I will get into that, but this is still FFVI. And FFVI is arguably the greatest video game ever made. The story, the charecters, the battle system, all of it is just fantastic. This is by far and away my personal favorite video game ever. But of course, my love with the game came from the SNES days. This version of the game, is not the SNES version.\n\nIt's not even the GBA or PS1 version. This is a port of the mobile version of the game. As such, it comes with some baggage. The most obvious, is the sprites. A lot of people have talked about them, and yes they are ugle and terrible. Though not as bad as some make them out to be. The main issue in fact with them is the emotes. The SNES version with the 16 bit sprites has some charm when the charecter freaks out, or wags their finger, because it was 16 bit, and looked great for it's time. And it was just funny. These new sprites when they do emotes, it just looks weird. Difficult to describe it any other way than that. Perhaps worse than the sprites is the text. Yes I know, I am complaining about font, but seriously, the font just looks terrible here.\n\nThere is also issues with the port. Controllers do not work, at least not for me. Some have had no problems, many others have. There are work arounds to get them to work and various things, but still. In my game if I just press a button on my controller, the game crashes. There have been other crashes and errors killing the game. Square continues a track record with bad PC ports (certainly not all are bad, but many are).\n\nBut once again I return to the beginning. It is still, despite the flaws, FFVI. Thus I have to still recomend this game. Are there better versions you can get your hands on? Absolutely. But this is one of the best video games ever created and not playing this game would be worse than playing it in this version. Thus I have to still recommend this, even if the port is terrible and the sprites and fonts ugly.","January 11","true","1.2"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","1"

But if you're willing to overlook the cosmetic change, you're in for a rather enjoyable experience.\n\nSome item and spell names have been changed, presumably to fit in better with the rest of the series, so it's a bit tough to het a handle on it in the beginning. The script's also been rewritten with less dunious translations so it does read and follow a bit better, but personally, I miss some of the better mistranslations.","January 23","true","27.6"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","0"

Not extremely good but far from being ugly.\n\n2 - Good battle interface - a bit too big but at least it's well-designed and functional.\n\n3 - Story of the game is intact\n\n4 - Good sounds and musics.\n\nBADS :\n\n1 - No real gamepad support dispise the fact that it's labeled as "full controler support". Basically the game can't recognize most gampads natively and if you use a program like x360ce to compensate the game will crash everytime you press a button.\n\n2 - Really limited control with the keyboard - it shows mostly in battle when using Sabin's blitzs\n\n3 - Sabin's Blitzs are EXTREMELY hard to execute because most of them are performed with multi-directional arrow inputs like the Phoenix Dance which is in short a complete half circle from left to right including 2 diagonal inputs, which is almost impossible to do without a controler.\n\n4 - Random lost of saved games - This one could be more related to Steam Cloud and not the game itself so stay on the safe side, disable the Steam Cloud before playing.\n\n5 - Even if i like the graphics the gameplay looks a bit too zoomed-in and it can make some players feel clostrophobic.\n\n6 - The price is too high compared to the efforts SE put into this port.\n\n7 - There is many other bugs i haven't encountered yet because they are at specific locations and i'm not there yet but if you read other reviews you will see there is some problematic locations.\n\nNow my opinion :\n\nIt's not a really bad port (FF4 was way worst than this) but it's not the best SE could have done if they had put a minimal effort - which is not their forte when it comes to their old classics.  It feels really like a rushed port and it shows a lot. So far i have ± 3 hours of play and it's not giving me too much troubles when it's not crashing. There is many things Square-Enix has to fix before considering this one to be a worthy port of the most epic FF of all time to my opinion.\n\nConclusion :\n\nShould you buy this FF 6 port? Yes and No\n\nYES : if you don't mind playing with your keyboard only and if you don't care about the bugs and you just want to play that game again\n\nNo : if you want to play a bug-free game with full controler support.\n\nSo to conclude i'd say that even if it's not a bad port i'd recommend buying it only after Square-Enix solves at least the controler support and the saved data vanishing.","January 8","true","7.2"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

From there the game proceeds to lock up and the only way to exit is to CTRL, ALT, Delete. Issues like these should not be  present in games that have as many incarnations as FF6, I feel that this was a very lazy attempt at a port of one of the greatest games of the 1990's and its an insult to fans of the series to release something like this.","December 28, 2015","false","9.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

seems kinda stupid to just taunt someone in chains eh, lol seems someone needs to do better on there Censor-ing... or when Kakfa calls Edgar a "Son of a Submariner" hahaha Cracks me up, but than the Censoring happens again and calls him a sandwurm ?

In fact this game is so good that I've never really questioned whether it was still my favorite, despite playing many other amazing games. If you like RPG's, good story, and great soundtracks then this game is for you. This is Nobuo Uematsu's best soundtrack despite the limitations represented by a 16-bit system and the characters are great. If you've never played this game then you have to play this game.

I will support it regardless of quality because of the nostalgia invoked.  This game is no exception.  That being said... here are a few critiques if you're considering buying:\n\n1) If you assign controls to letters on your keyboard, you're in for a suprise.  I use the home row for A,B,Y,X buttons, and it turns when you name a character the game translates this into typing a letter AND executing a controller command.  For example, it's time to name Terra, and "Terra" pops up on the screen.  I press "F" to confirm, and it confirms AND adds an "F" to Terra's name.  "TerraF" is now in my party. Obnoxious.\n\n2) A lot of the items are renamed.  While I support updated poorly translated 90s game dialogue, this makes it semi-tricky when you're a speedy player, and trying to quickly do menuing. Ex: Atlas Armlet, True Knight, or Back Guard are all different.\n\n3) Fun glitches still exist, but they differ with gameplay.  Example, if you're a fan of executing Setzer's famous "Joker Doom" by using an Echo Screen and pausing in the slot command, it can be done.  However, the timing is very different making it significantly difficult.  (Note: you can still execute the Locke sprite glitch and walk through the soldier in South Figaro during his scenario... so, that's cool.\n\n4) Lastly, some of the new graphics are just plain bad.  Cyan's sprite - formerly awesome - looks absolutely ridiculous.  A lot of the backgrounds are updated, animated, and high definition.  However, this makes the low definition sprites look terrible.  Worst of all... magicite looks like someone drew it in microsoft paint, crudely cropped it, and then pasted it in the game.  Single-tear-lol.","January 9","true","143.3"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Since then final fantasy has been the driving force behind my history of platform upgrades (up until ff 13 the worst game ever). I have played ff6 more times than I can count both on snes and psone. With that being said there are 3 major points I'd like to touch on:\n\nSprites- if i have to listen to one more whiney little b... let me start again. Originaly the characters were more jagged black outline than character and looked little better than atari babies. You may not like the cheesey cute (chibi-ish) style update, but hey all gen snes rpgs looked like this. Big heads on little cartoon bodies. You didn't start to see elongated characters until ps1 (with the exception of chrono trigger). You should respect the past, which is was SE is doing. The toons look like they fit into a snes rpg like one would expect, but the textures are smoother.\n\nUpgraded graphics/maps- ALL to the good except for the 3d models of the castles. I will admit it looks cruddy and doesn't fit in. The other 3d map icons are attractive looking imo.\n\nBattle speed/grind- I can't tell if the new "repeat" and fast forward is just speeding everything up greatly or if the game is just easier. I remember there being some difficulty and grinding necesssary. Now it kind of plays like a children's book. This could be good or bad. It allows for a trip down memory lane that won't take forever to play a master play through. Whether or not that irks you is your decision.\n\nAll in all this is the best FF6, and still is. I don't know who all these whiney people are, but there is nothing, I mean NOTHING wrong with this game. This isn't a ps3 game, or xbox. This is a SUPER NINTENDO GAME. If it looks like low grade stickers... well welcome to snes you dumb ars. I miss when developers came out with games like this. Rpgs are all action crap now.\n","January 26","true","68.6"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","3","9","2","0"

But, here goes.\nI first played this game as FFIII on the SNES.  Yeah.  For weeks, I would rent it from the movie store over the weekend when I was young, and honestly...I was too stupid to get very far.  I mean, I was usually stuck within the first few hours of the game.  I didn't know I had to meet Edgar, or what I was doing.  I thought I had to get Cider to an old man before someone else gave it to him...  It was a mess.  A lot of the time, I would open someone else's save file further on just to see what else was coming up.  But I fell in Love.  I loved the character art, the music, everything.\nWhen I was a few years older, this came out as FFVI in Final Fantasy Anthology for the PlayStation.  I bought it and a guide, and was able to have the FULL experience finally.  I played this game SO much, and re-played, and beat it as well as finding all the secrets I could.  It was magical.  From Edgar's relationship with Sabin (something reminding me of a friendship I had at the time), to Locke's past with Rachel, to Shadow's mysterious past and speculations about whether or not Gogo is Setzer's Daryl, I was hooked.  The story didn't dwell too long on words.  We saw flashbacks, heard music, and were drawn in.\nOne of the best aspects was the variety of characters.  Yeah, it can be overwhelming for some people.  To me, it added personality, and bridged the gap between the era of FF games where you made a party (or just had the same small group all game), and where you were forced to always have the Main character on the team.  Earlier in the game, it makes you experience gameplay with All the characters.  You get a feel for them.  Then, World of Ruin.  Find as many of the old members as you feel like, and choose who you want your party to be.  Do you prefer strength?  Sabin, Edgar, Cyan and whoever!  Are you a magic-user?  Relm, Terra, Celes and Strago!  Mixed party?  Edgar, Locke, Mog and Gau maybe!  And best of all, the Espers allowed you to have stat bonuses as you leveled up.  You want that magic user to have stronger magic?  Alright.  You want her to be able to make stronger Physical attacks?  Can do.\nIt was fun, versatile, and never seemed to force emotion on me.  No offense FF7, but FF6 made me cry more with small parts involving side characters and how they impacted our main characters than you ever did by killing off a main party member.  I still cry sometimes just listening to Rachel Forever, adrenaline pumps when I hear the overworld theme, and I still get chills hearing the song from the Phantom Train.\nWith newer graphics, an updated combat system allowing for speedy battles, and polishing all around, this really is the re-make I have been waiting for.  It's not just a port of the American "FFIII" with a new title background calling it FFVI.  This is a second chance for a true classic to work its way into Your heart if you were too young to have known what a Super Nintendo was.\n\nEdit: An interesting point was brought up, and it would only be fair to address it.  FF4 had a remake (also on Steam) which did a complete overhaul on the game.  There were more secrets, very different graphics, updates to combat, bonuses for viewing all of the maps, and extra skills you could let your party learn.  For That game, I liked that.  I was never a fan of classic FFIV, and the remake changed my feelings.\nFor FFVI, that was Not done.  Yes, I could say we're missing out by having goofier-looking character sprites.  I could say whoever was in charge of giving us this updated version was lazy because we weren't given extra secrets or a full overhaul of ALL game graphics.  But as a fearer of change on my nostalgic memories, I can't help but think that such a decision may have created a larger rift in fans of the game.  While a part of me does dream of a remake of this game with FFXIII's graphics, and more to explore in my favorite Final Fantasy world, the young teenage boy in me continues to see this like an old friend, even if he's dressed a little bit funny.\n\nAfter having played more of this version, I have to say I like the newer mix of graphics.  Or I'm used to it.  We still have the old-style pictures where characters are talking.\nWhile I really like how Sabin's Blitz is executed iin Kindle, where it gives you time to tap the direction you plan to input for the technique, using a control on this version is tough.  I tried 5 times to execute Meteor Strike before I was able to successfully input a diagonal arrow without also up or right/left.\nI do like Cyan's sword techniques this time.  It may be a little faster than the original version, and now each technique is marked by Japanese characters for the name, which is pretty cool.\nThe in game dialogue has also been improved, so it's not as messy as it had been.","January 4","true","51.6"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","6"

This is definitely an epic classic in the Final Fantasy series. It includes an awesome story with cool characters and music. I am grateful for the graphical update, although it's been a while since I've played the game, so I didn't notice it as much. I did notice the change in how the ATB fills up, which I was ok with.\n\nMy only problem with the game was that I couldn't figure out how to exit the game without saving first and then choosing to go to the Title Screen. Otherwise, I used the Windows and Tab keys to get out of that window and close it manually.\n\nI used an XBox 360 controller that I bought specifically for PC gaming and it worked well with this game.

Fortunately, the developer acted quickly and I was able to continue and didn't encounter another bug in the whole 33 hour playthrough.\n\nDespite being widely regarded as one of the best games in the series, I had never played more than a couple of hours of FFVI before starting it on PC.\n\nThere were many complaints by members of the Steam community when this game launched, such as the character sprites being those of the recent mobile console refreshes, as well as the game interface itself. I can't say that I had any trouble with either of these points during my story playthrough. The game interface is surprisingly easy to control with an Xbox One controller, and the character sprites were well animated. I'd never played the game with the older SNES sprites, so can't comment on that.\n\nThe game's soundtrack is excellent, and with the exception of VII, is my favourite of any game in the series. Each character and area has their own instantly recognisable theme, which is always well suited to their visual design, which is definitely more steampunk in setting than the medievil games which proceeded it, or the sci-fi settings of VII and VIII.\n\nThe characters have plenty of depth and each, even the optional characters, have fully fleshed out and explorable back-stories. I'd even say that I prefer the lead villain in VI to Sephiroth from VII, because he provides quite a lot of humour to the story. There are also plenty of side-missions which you'd expect from any popular Final Fantasy game.\n\nDefinitely recommended for any fan of classic JRPGs, who dont mind their games being modernised slightly.","January 3","true","33.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Possible reasoning for the upgraded graphics in this one is, quite frankly, the original version just ported onto pc would look like ♥♥♥. It was designed to be played on older RGB televions.

Yes.\n+New sprites?  You get used to them.  In fact, they grow on you, and do, in fact, look much better. (except that Sabin has very feminine eyelashes when he is surprised.  Oh well, he's pretty)\n+Different dialogue?  As long as Terra doesn't start spouting "Holy ♥♥♥♥ monkey testicle reacharound! That continent is flying (spoiler!)!"  (Only a spoiler if you never played this and never had a childhood.  Also, you're probably dead inside)\nActually scratch that.  I want Terra to say ""Holy ♥♥♥♥ monkey testicle reacharound! That continent is flying!" That would be badass!\n+Avatars for character when they speak?  Yeah! My imagination is horrible and I need a physical representation of the character speaking so I can fill in the blank spot in my brain.  (no seriously though, the avatar art is from the original art.  it's pretty awesome)\n+Music remains unchanged.  It goes through a different synth (for those with an acute ear for this kind of thing) but essentially is unchanged, and still MIDI-ly awesome.\n+Kefka's laugh.\n+Map is super sick!  I get perspective on the buildings when I move past a city on the world map! Wut wut!\n\n-IOS PORT!  ARGH.  Ok, it's not so bad, but going through a list is quite painful. I mean, they're arranged by 3s, and it's so awkward to maneuver.  If you guys could patch this and NOT make it look like I'm playing this on my iPad, that'd be greeeaaaat.  Thaaaanks.\n-Clunky movement.  I like how 8directions were implemented.  That the characters now no longer feels like a robot given North South East West directions is pretty cool.  Unfortunately, movement is clunky.  There is a pause when the sprite changes when I change direction, making moving around in a city map very awkward and stuttering.\n-(another thing or two I can't remember, so they must not be very important)\n\nIn conclusion, would recommend.  Story is the same.  System is the same.  Changes from the original that don't dramatically change the game experience, just a few minor things.\nAlso, people not recommending this game just because of a few minor details are suuuuuuuuuuuuper butthurt.\n(Although if they're not recommending because of glitches, that's super legit.  Although I've gotten no glitch related problem in my playthrough.)\n\nI bought this yesterday and have more than 15 hours played.

I mean this too.  I first played Final Fantasy '3' on SNES when I was 14 years old, and have re-played the game every few years since.  It is like a favourite book that one returns to again and again.  I realise that some folks wanted this game to have been completely redone in 3D and voice acted, but frankly that would simply have destroyed it.  This game got exactly what it needed.  A touch-up.  It's rough graphics, sound, and translation are smoothed out.  A few handy features have been added to make it more accessable.  And that's it.  All they did was wax a classic car, which is what they should have done.  You don't put modern mag-wheels and jam a spoiler on a '55 corvette no matter how much you think it will add to the ride.  Same thing.  So whatever all the nay-sayers are throwing out about this, it is a faithful reproduction of an exceptional game.\n\nThoughts as follows:\n\nThe graphics were gorgeous in their original 16-bit, and they have been carefully touched up to look even better in this version.   This is not a simple video filter, as anyone who has ever played this on an emulator like zsnes should pick up instantly.\nThe Character sprites do not look out of place, they just look different than they used to and they do look better.\nThe addition of the original art profiles to the dialogue is actually very nice and adds character without spoiling ones own visualization of the characters as a 3D rendering could have.\nThe Score is enhanced and cleaned up from the old SNES midis and sounds much closer to the original instrumental score, released  on cd in 1994.\nThe translation is touched up and some of the more ridiculous and confusing moments in the original release make more sense.  No change to substance whatever.\nThe only two gameplay tweaks, auto-battle and quick-save, ease the playability by taking away some of the pain of grinding and eliminating classic frustration with the great old glitch/power outage, 'holy xxxx, i haven't saved in an hour' moment. All without changing the gameplay in any substantiveway.\n\nonly complaints:\n\nNaming fail.  stupid error that I trust will be rectified with a patch, but you can't use 'wasd' for arrow keys without adding 'd' to the end when naming character.  Hardly a game-breaker though as all you have to do is use your arrow keys for 'abxy' and use backspace to eliminate the addition before accepting.\n\nA few glitches - game has stopped a couple of times in about 8 hours of play, as expected in any new release.  happily though, every time I was able to start where it froze by virtue of the game auto-quicksaving with each room change. So you just hit continue when you reload and start where it froze.\n\nAll in all the game is more beautiful, more enjoyable, and gently tweaked rather than sullied by 'upgrades' that would have cheapend this fine game like coca-cola in a glass of Bowmore's 15 year old 'Darkest'.\n\nHappy to spend the price of a mediocre bottle of wine on this well-cellared gem.","December 23, 2015","true","20.7"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","5","15","0","0"

It still stands up as a great JRPG, although it's a bit dated compared to modern games - you know your gameplay needs some work when there's a fast-forward button. The negative reviews on Steam almost scared me off from checking out this long overdue Steam release, which mostly seem to gripe about the graphical changes and some bugginess, but I'm glad I got it, and experienced no bugs whatsoever in a full play-through.\n\nOn the graphics: The sprites look fine to me - character sprites are blurred, but I don't think the quality is anything worse than various emulator filters. Environmental sprites look just fine to me, including the "3D" shaded overworld ones. The redrawn character dialogue portraits are a huge improvement and look great, apart from Emperor Gestahl who got hit by an airship which prematurely aged him several centuries. The new 3D models for towns and castles on the overworld map do look wonky, but whatever. There is all new background imagery for battles, and spell animations, which all look pretty good. Anti-aliased text and an overhauled interface are a big step up over playing this on an emulator. It's clearly an iOS port, the battle menus have touchscreen-friendly largeness, forcing one to scroll when they could easily fit on any PC monitor.\n\nThis release is the same content as the Game Boy Advance version from 2007, which I never played and was my main reason for picking this up on Steam. It fixes a large number of bugs from the original SNES version, and has vastly improved text translation, truer to the original Japanese, such as for Cyan's arsenal, and truer to the intent, as in the spell "Meltdown" instead of "Merton". Added after the final Kefka fight are the multi-party Dragon's Den dungeon, the Soul Shrine, and a new final boss: Omega Weapon. Dragon's Den was fun for a while, but overstayed its welcome. The Soul Shrine and Omega Weapon feel tacked-on. So I'm a little underwhelmed by the bonus content, but it was still a good time. Outdated gameplay, but fun characters, fun story, and nostalgic appeal.","January 12","true","159.7"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

As for the sprites, they're an adjustment, but hey, they're designed by the creator of the original sprites, and it's hard to argue with that.\n\nThe soundtrack is wonderfully done—normally, with adaptations of 16-bit games such as these, you get a lame-sounding MIDI sountrack with instrumentation that's all wrong. I'm not sure what kind of audio engine they're using for this adaptataion, but it faithfully captures the spirit of the S-SMP chip, for which this soundtrack was originally composed. Very happy with that. The iconic opening scene with Tina's Theme gave me some nostalgic tingles, which wouldn't have happened if the music just weren't right.\n\n\nI'm not very far into the game yet, so I can imagine I'll find some things to gripe about along the way, but so far, most of the negative reviews seem unmerited.

I played through the original (titled Final Fantasy 3 in the US) dozens of times in the 90's and this new coat of paint makes it feel like a fresh experience again. It's impossible to replace the nostalgia I have for this game and it's original sprites, but most of the new art work quickly grew on me. Some of the character sprites aren't quite as great as the originals, but then some others are fantastic (look at the new sprite for Shadow.) The enemies and battle backgrounds look great. The game runs smoothly, the music is still Nobuo Uematsu's orignal masterpiece, and it's one of the best games ever created.\n\nThere are a few illogical issues with the control scheme. For example, when you select a spell in battle, you first choose from the White, Black, or Grey schools of magic. If you choose black magic and then decide you want to cast a white or grey spell instead, you can't just switch to them. Instead you have to cancel out of the menu, choose magic again, and then choose the school you want to cast a spell from. This can be a problem if you're using Active Time Battle and don't already know what spell you're going to cast. Also, while you are selecting a target, up and down chooses an enemy from a list as expected, but pressing left or right switches the character you are controlling instead of changing your target from the enemy list to the party list. To switch between the 2 sides, you press square instead (using a PS4 controller).\n\nThis game runs at 60 fps, unlike Final Fantasy V on Steam, which is strangely capped at 30 fps.\n\nThere are a few improvements compared to the original version. When inputing a Blitz with Sabin, you can now see which buttons have been recognized before confirming. Also, you can now select which sword technique Cyan will use instead of waiting for a bar to fill. Auto battle is a nice improvement. It commands each character to use their previous action and speeds up the pace in case it ever feels "grindy".\n\n\nIf you have any doubts as to whether or not you want to buy this game, let me help you. Buy it.","January 2","true","16.5"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

The story is amazing, the characters' dialogue is extremely well written, and the art style is amazing and unique. The game may be over 20 years old, but it is still an experience that I'd recommend for everybody.\n\nNow that I'm done talking about the NES/GBA/Playstation versions let's talk about the PC/iOS/Android versions...\n\nUgh, the remade graphics are really not something that me and a bunch of other people would approve of if we were in charge of the people remaking this work of art. Most of the sprites look goofy and a bit half-a**ed, I think that square enix could have done a much much much muuuuch better job with them, or not even done anything to them.\n\nOther changes to the game are mostly positive, they can be read here[finalfantasy.wikia.com], my favorite of which being the optional hints and marking where to go, really progresses the story if you're a bit of an RPG noob and don't wanna look it up on youtube. Final Fantasy VI PC also has many things a modern port of an older game would have such as achievements and an awesome built in music player with every soundtrack in the game to listen to (highly recommended because the game has an amazing OST).\n\nFinal thoughts:\nFinal Fantasy 6 is an amazing game, beautiful, a work of art, top notch JRPG. The graphics are sub-par, yes, but since when have graphics had a giant impact on a 2d game anyway? The story is fantastic, the characters are lovable, the art style is beautiful and fits the mood, one of the most amazing soundtracks I've ever heard in my life, and 14 playable characters with different stats and abilities.

I played the game on SNES, PS1, and PSN (PS3/PSP/PS Vita version of the PS1 game) and never got the chance to get the GBA port. At first, I thought it wouldn't be that great considering it was a port from mobile (Android, specifically) and that it had the new sprite designs. The new UI and sprite designs grew on me and it is a perfectly fine port now that I have put some time into it. It even has the GBA content, which was in the mobile versions, which is another plus, as well as many of the earlier version bugs and glitches being fixed. It makes for a more balanced game. It also has the improved script of the later versions, which sounds alot better than the SNES version.\n\nThere are a few things that can be improved on, though, such as completely removing the Default Battle setup or at least changing it to the original game's style on SNES,PS1, PSN, and GBA.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fugsnarf/recommended/382900/","fugsnarf","Fugsnarf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fugsnarf/","120 products in account","I just want you to know the joy that is Final Fantasy VI, my favorite game in the series. If you haven't played it, this isn't the wrong choice, necessarily. I recommend this only because it's a legal way to play the game if you don't have access to any other, and it's an alternative that is perfectly passable. However you experience Final Fantasy VI is up to you, but this port does have a lot of serious design issues among other problems. This would be my last recommendation on which version of this game to play (ignoring the mobile one, which this is a port from), but no matter what, this is still Final Fantasy VI. Here is my extended opinion:\n\n\nWhy this port sucks     Ugly and clashing sprite and menu redesign: Sprites are muddy and lack the character of the originals from the SNES, in my opinion. The second part could be debated, but I think it's clear that not a lot of effort went into these sprites when compared to the likes of the Final Fantasy 1, 2, and 4 remakes on the PSP. The menu design I'll get into below, but how it looks really clashes with the art design of the game. It looks like iOS design from 5 years ago -- big bubbles with the little shininess on them. Not steampunk in the slightest.\nOversized menu bubbles: Everything in the menus and battles is huge! I'm sure a mod will come out to fix this, but for now it's horrible to live through having to scroll through tons of gigantic, bland-looking bubbles. It's very off-putting.The alternative to the scrolling bubbles in battle are ok, but they're still way too big and you need to scroll down to unseeable bubbles in the menu screen for some options.\nTerrible walking controls: The walking controls are not pleasant. They default to 8-direction, which is awkward as heck, but you can switch it to 4-directions. The problem is that you can't fluidly change direction while moving. Often times I'll hit something like "right then down" and I'll only move down because my movement right only registered as a change of the direction my character is facing. Now that's a quick way to frustrate me. Unacceptable.\nLack Resolution Options and Widescreen: There's no resolution option above 1360x768. I mean, what? How do you get that wrong, SquareEnix? It doesn't look too bad if you choose a resolution that scales well, but that shouldn't need to happen. It's absolutely unacceptable. You can play in fullscreen, but it isn't widescreen, so it leaves black borders on the edges.\nNo respect for one of the best games: This all hits home even more because it's my favorite Final Fantasy game. And even if it isn't your favorite, it sure as heck deserves a lot more respect than this poor excuse for an "update" to the game.\nWhy this port is ok     60 FPS: Yes, it's actually 60 fps. Now that's a first coming from SquareEnix's mobile Final Fantasy ports!\nDecent Upscaled Art: Everything except the menus and characters' sprites actually looks decently upscaled. Some look nicer than others, but I'd say it's passable for the most part.\nUntampered Soundtrack: They didn't mess with the music. It's pretty much as I remember it, though maybe slightly different -- nothing wrong with it at all to me.\nGood Translation: It's got an updated translation to the SNES one, as far as I can tell so far. I'm not sure if it's the same as the GBA translation, but it could be a plus if you care about that.\nThis is still Final Fantasy VI: Not only is it my favorite Final Fantasy game, but my second favorite game ever. I'm not alone. This is a legendary RPG that deserves your attention regarldess of how you play it.\nLegal Alternative for the conscientious, PC-only crowd: If you only have a PC and, due to moral reasons, you do not want to pirate, this is a an option for you. There's always the mobile version, but I'd posit that this is superior if only for the increased control options between keyboard and different controllers. There's also the fact that people are going to create mods that will fix certain game problems such as the graphics -- something you won't get on mobile.\nThis is one of the greatest JRPGs of all time -- no question. Does this port do it justice? I don't think so. This port just shows why there's a stigma on mobile games. The ports of games to mobile platforms are just usually inferior in a lot of ways. And they don't need to be! There's no reason that they had to make the sprites and menus look so bland and terrible. But they did, and it's unfortunate.\n\nI'd say hold on to your money until there's a mod out to fix the aformentioned problems -- mainly concerning the menus and walking problems (the latter will probably require some fix by SquareEnix themselves that will never come). It's all really the same problems that Final Fantasy V's PC port had. The only thing missing is the seams between tiles which I have yet to see, to my delight.\n\nI recommend it if the pros outweight the cons for you. It's hard for me to recommend this port to anyone, but I want everyone to play this game. If this is how you do it, there's nothing that will hamper your experience of the story, world, and characters -- what really matters here. So my hands are tied in how I rate this. If I don't recommend it, then I'm not recommending one of my favorite games of all time. If I recommend it, I can't avoid the fact that there's a lot wrong with this game. I can't, in good conscience, hold back a recommendation for this game if this version looks good to you. So that's why it's recommended regardless of all the problems.","December 16, 2015","true","4.4"," 61 of 142 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","61","142","3","2"

I've loved FF3 (US) for SNES since it came out all those years ago. I loved 2 as well, and picked it up (FF IV). I recall being reasonably happy with that purchase. This one.. I don't know man. I don't know.\n\nI'll be fair, under the hood it feels like the same game. They didn't seem to monkey with the sound all that much, which is a plus. They did however mess with the graphics. Tiles look ok, but the sprites look downright awful. The original tiles have an darkish serious-cartoon type feel. The sprites had a similar feel. It was basically 8-bit anime, granted. Now it just looks like plastercine stop-motion puppets. It's freaking depressing.\n\nThey messed with the combat. Full disclosure, at the time of writing, I played for maybe 5 minutes. The combat is MORE OR LESS the same. Except for instead of an informative bottom panel listing monsters, players, etc. Each player's portrait is shown at the bottom. They "pop up" as the active battle time marches on. I'm not sure what purpose that serves, other than to adapt for touchscreens... which leads me to another thing...\n\nThis feels like a filthy port. I say filthy, because of the above reasons. They broke the game shoehorning it on a device that probably had no business having a game like this on it, collected the putrid remains then shoved it into a Steam release. To that I say, what the hell. The other Final Fantasy games surrounding this one were reasonable contenders. It just doesn't make sense that they'd completely mangle their pride and joy? Again, I only played for 5 minutes. I do plan to play more.\n\nIt IS, afterall, Final Fantasy 3/6. It's still an awesome game, under all the crap. Because of that, It's a reluctant "Recommend". It's not a good iteration of this game by FAR, but it's still the same game in essence. I just wonder, if they're going to do a terrible port, why only target Windows...?

(Optional)\n-Pressing X gets you a reminder of the next plot item or goal.\n-A "!" pops up next to interactables, including hidden items if you are facing them.\n-They didn't change any of the classic music or sound effects, thank jebus.\n\nCONS:\n-UI and font choice is basic and hideous.\n-It's missing some good "Woolseyisms", poor translations that added a lot of character to the game.\n\nOVERALL:\nI wish it had way to switch between old/new artwork for UI/Characters/World Art. All in all, it's a different edition with different things to check out, and you know what...I needed THAT to want to play through this game again.\n\n\n\n10:14 PM - flashdim:","December 19, 2015","true","24.2"," 10 of 31 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","10","31","0","0"

The game has managed to keep my attention better than any other game I've ever played.  I find myself going back to it and replaying it constantly.  I can't say enough about the game itself, fantastic writing, fantastic music, and fun gameplay.  The story alone is worth the price of addmission.\n\nTo address the steam port itself: Unlike many other reviewers, I don't mind the changes to the GUI, or the sprites.  I find it pays great homage to the original SNES version while giving it an updated feel.  I do wish they would have made native 1080 support, but it still looks fine in the lower resolutions (it is an SNES game afterall).\n\nI strongly recommend the game, and even the port.  $15 dollars isn't a large price to pay for the story alone.","December 19, 2015","true","29.2"," 13 of 38 people (34%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","34","13","38","3","0"

Having grown up in the nes era, and having played countless hours of the original series releases, I was worried that this release would be another '3D', modestly edited port similar to the FF3 and FF4 releases.  I'm no super fan by any means, and I enjoy the new ports, but I prefer the older style.\n\nThis port has really delivered and remained true to the original (well, mostly).  The story is all there, the characters and general mechanics are all there, and the graphics are a great balance between the old and the modern styles.  I'm a bit turned off by a few character portraits, but that is a matter of preference.  Also, the UI will likely feel like a hot mess to players looking for the original interface, but with a little time it's just a mild annoyance and fully playable.\n\nCould this port have been made better?  Yes.  I'm more than satisfied though, and I highly recommend this game to new and old fans of the series.","December 19, 2015","true","144.7"," 12 of 36 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","12","36","0","0"

The story is tight, dramatic, and captivating. The environments are artfully crafted and brought to life with interesting set pieces and stunning enemy mobs. The musical score is lush and memorable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GuyInDogSuit/recommended/382900/","GuyInDogSuit","GuyInDogSuit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GuyInDogSuit/","608 products in account","OK, first off, I am not one of those purists that will take pixels over smooth any day. I actually like this art style. I don't think they needed to smooth them out though, but then again, it isn't really an issue. I have played practically every version of this game, including the original Japanese Super Famicom one, translated by Sky Render. Everyone I know pretty much agrees that the SNES and GBA versions were the best, especially if you hack the GBA ROM to insert the original Super Famicom/SNES audio. Square Enix ported that version to iOS and Android, sprucing up the graphics and using the original SNES audio. Towns and castles on the world map are now 3D models. The character sprites have been smoothed, and the portraits appear in the dialogue box. The menus had been changed to reflect the touch screen interface, and this version retains that same look, unfortunately. The gamepad controls are the same as the smartphone version, with the option to have a scrolling battle menu or tabs. I played it on my NVIDIA Shield, so I already knew the controls. The script appears to be the same as the GBA version with some minor tweaks. The new features that were added to the GBA version appeared in the smartphone port, and are present in this port as well, so we have the extra dungeons and bosses to look forward to. Another addition to the smartphone port was achievements, which are present in the Steam version, too.\n\nFinal Fantasy VI is probably my favorite of the series. As I stated, I have played every version of it, even the PS1 port with loading times. Ugh. So of course I bought this version. What are the pros and cons? Well, for the pros, you get a classic RPG with a decent length, great story and characters, and fun gameplay. It has a great customization system, where each character not only has their own specific class and abilities, but they can ALL learn magic spells (except for two, one of which doesn't need to learn them, as you'll see). Each party member can equip different weapons, and two relics apiece, which can greatly improve abilities and stats. The story is fairly basic, nothing too complex, but that's what gives it its charm. There are a total of 14 characters to recruit, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. And of coiurse, there's an airship or two. And chocobos and Moogles.\n\nThe cons? Well, nothing major. My only gripes with this port is are minor ones, but glaringly noticeable at first. First, the game is NOT widescreen. It initially starts in a windowed mode, though Alt+Enter maximizes it. However, like the Final Fantasy V port, there are black bars on each side. This is something that irritated me about the smartphone port. Initially, the game was widescreen, taking up almost the whole screen on my HTC M8, but with an update, they added bars on the side, with the time and a battery indicator. Not necessary. by any means. And for some reason, they did it to FFV, too. And thus the Steam ports have black bars. No idea why they weren't able to fix that.\nSecond, the interface is clunky. Huge. And it bothers me that once again, Square Enix couldn't be bothered to at least scale it down for a bigger screen. Of course, that would require more effort, something they seem to be incapable of with all these ports. At least Lightning Returns got the treatment it deserved, unlike the first two FFXIII games. And FFIII and IV still have gamebreaking bugs, years later. But I digress. A third, but again, minor issue, is that there's slight screen blur when walking around, particularly horizontally. But all three of these issues can be overlooked as once you've played for a half-hour or so, you don't even notice them anymore.\n\nSo what is my final verdict? Get this game. Especially if you've never played it before. Buy it on Green Man Gaming right now, and use the voucher code on the home page to knock it down to $12.32. Not bad for a 30+ hour classic.","December 16, 2015","true","25.4"," 35 of 87 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","35","87","2","1"

(Need I say more?)\n\nYes, actually it seems I do need to so here's a few things review-wise:\n(please keep in mind that I am comparing legitimate versions of the game, not emulated versions)\n\n1. This game has one of the most memorable and engrossing stories in all of gaming history, so much so that it makes the story of Final Fantasy 7 seem mediocre by comparison.\n\nAs a side note, the translation has been tweaked and improved from the GBA version which is always nice to see.\n\n2. The GBA version, has terrible sound quality, this preserves the original SNES sound quality with some modernized improvement tweaks, very pleasent to listen to overall in this steam version. As someone who started playing this when it was still called Final Fantasy III in NA, the only sound that seemed out of place so far were the organs on the intro screen. Whether or not the new organs are good or bad is again, subjective.\n\n3. This modernized version of the game runs smoothly in a comfortable windowed mode, much like emulators would be used to run the older version, there is no real need to full screen it since the art assests are not meant to be blown up that large anyway...\n\nFor those of you that DEMAND full screen here's a trick: alt+enter (I know, magic)\n\nOn that note it should also be mentioned that the text is very crisp and easy on the eyes in this release compared to  the GBA version or the even older versions.\n\nThe updated sprites, in my opinion, fit cleanly into the updated background textures of the world they are in. Also, these new assests add fresh life and color to an old world. Considering they are products of the original sprite designer, they function quite well and do not feel out of place at all within the moving world of the game.\n\nTo add to those points, this version is visually a large improvement over the old versions that were made for a SD display. It seems important to remind some people that the original game, being a game made for SD display, will look very distorted and blocky at any resolution higher than 640x480 while this game can reach higher resolutions.\n\n4. The game has full controller support in my experience with no lag and responsive input. Navigating the updated menus works quite well with an analog stick.\n\nSpeaking of menus, everything from the battle menu to the inventory menus seem to fit nicely after a few minutes of adjustment seem quite sensible for the functions they are meant to perform.\n\n\nIgnore the haters, dont pay attention to the nostalgia whiners, this game is worth having and it is a story that will stick with you for a long time to come.\n\nJust remember that it is easier to complain and nitpick than it is to actually make one of these games yourself, but as someone who has played this game since it's original NA release, this is a version worth having considering it does not look like blocks of color at resolutions higher than SD.","December 16, 2015","true","42.8"," 77 of 185 people (42%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","42","77","185","5","2"

Play it in some format.\n\nNow on to the review.   This PC version is a direct port of the mobile version of Final Fantasy VI that was released some years ago.   Touch interface adapts fairly well to mouse and keyboard input.   There is controller support and the basic bindings are sensible though just enough things are changed from the original console versions to make things awkward for people familiar with the game.    New graphics are a mixed bag.   All of the added content from the Game Boy Advance edition that came out in the early 2000s is here with a translation that is polished, though not as heart-warming as the SNES original.   Bottom line it is a good and playable version of the game if you haven't played Final Fantasy VI before (or in quite a few years).

It's jarring for the first five min or so.\n\nThe team making the IOS game stayed as true to the original art style as possible, and that's not going to be a good thing for some people.  The characters arms are all freakishly long, for example, and there's sections in the game where in the original there were some graphical design mistakes, and for whatever reason these mistakes are still here and since it's been cleaned up they are more noticeable\n\nYou'll notice some slowdown occasionally, which is odd considering how small a game this is.\n\n:::Now, the good stuff:::\n\nIt's freaking FF6!!!! It's one of the best in the series.\n\nOnce you actually get used to the menu system it's more functional than the original game's menu system.\n\nMUCH appreciated balance tweaks, the biggest I've noticed so far being Cyan's sword arts.  In every other release so far you were not able to issue commands to your party while his sword arts charged, and the baddies would swing on you, which made him by far and wide the absolute worst character in the game.  Now you can issue commands to your party while he charges his moves.\n\nBug fixes :D\nExample: Evade and accuracy aren't bugged out. (In the original raising evade did nothing, lowering accuracy also did nothing)\n\nTranslation.  It stays true enough to the Woosley version that you won't be sad it's gone, but it just reads better.\n\nStays so true to the original art style, if you're a fan of the original you will likely literally not realize you're not looking at the original visuals.  While things look jarring at first, give it about ten min and you'll feel like you're playing the original.","December 17, 2015","true","48.2"," 11 of 38 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","11","38","0","0"

This version has the bonus espers and extra dungeons from the GBA version. I imagine many people are annoyed that Kefka says Sandworm instead of Submariner, but otherwise the translation is fine.\n\nThe complaints about the sprites aside, the full-screen mode is letterboxed and the mouse pointer is visible.

The only complaint I have is the fact that when you want to customize your name for each character, it might be difficult for those who do not use enter as the OK button. For some reason, it likes to add the letter you put your OK button for.(Mine was C so terra became terrac) even though the curser wasnt on the name slot to change their name.\n\nOverall, I still say it is worth the 14-15 bucks and most definatly a must buy for the fans of Final fantasy of the old and the new.","December 16, 2015","true","33.5"," 21 of 64 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","21","64","0","0"

There are lovely battle effects for Terra's magic and I think the sprites are growing on me. The music is the same classic soundtrack, which is always lovely, and I LOVE THE PORTRAITS.\n\nThe meat of any RPG is the battle system, so let me tell you about it. There are these windows that represent a character on the bottom and when the window reaches all the way up, then that character can have an action from their list. You guys know that every character in the game has their own unique commands, right? At first it was just weird, but once I got the hang of it, I found it very fast to navigate! I am playing with a keyboard until I get a Xbox controller, which I am not used to, but once I learned all the commands, I was happy with it.\n\nIt does not go full screen. I don't care about that, most of the time I play in window mode to easily navigate what else I might need on the computer. There is no start up thing like in other Steam FF games, either, and I don't mind. I had to figure out all the commands until I reached the Adventurer's school, but at that point everything was explained.\n\nThe text is almost the same. Some parts are translated better, but some parts are word for word what we had on the SNES and PSX Anthology versions.

I have waited too long for this to be released on steam and I am quite happy with the looks of the new sprites and the UI, The updated graphics while yes could have been cleaned up a bit more, Are a welcomed and happy change. I am someone who played the original final fantasy on the snes back when i was 7 years old.

I recommend picking this up!\n\nPROS: Things i have found as an improvement over the original (SO FAR)\n\n- Autobattle has been added. Love it.\n- Sabin's Blitz's are much easier to use, (If you were terrible at them like me with the snes controller)\n- The text translation over the original snes is MUCH better in most instances.\n\nCONS:\n\n- The walking & running is just a bit clunky, you can switch between 4 & 8 directions in the settings but both are kinda awkward.\n\n\nI will edit as i continue playing. :)","December 16, 2015","true","70.3"," 26 of 78 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","26","78","2","2"

Probably one of the most loved RPG's from the SNES era, finally, released on PC.  So....am I going to say anything that matters?  If you are like me you saw this game and just shoved a handfull of bills at your screen before you realized you need to use your credit card to buy this.  Look, if you have fond memories of this and don't own it on SNES you will probably buy this.....or maybe you have it on the PSx, or an emulator.....well I have it on emulator, PSx and (unfortunately not SNES) now on my PC.    Over my life I have probably paid for this game more times than any other....and you know....I never regreted it once.\n\nSo the good.\n+SNES style music and sound are intact.\n+ITS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FFVI!\n+Graphics look nice and smooth, the update is subtle and really fits in the style nice, it still looks like the game I remember with a bit of gloss, which honestly.....is all I would have wanted.\n\nThe Bad\n-I swear the SNES version controlled better, it is minor since movement isnt a big deal in these kind of games it still seems.....strangely delayed, but possibly only a second or so, just enough to feel weird w/o being a real big problem.\n-The menus are actually less user friendly, honestly again a minor problem but ....it can be frustrating, for example I equip a new sword.....I stay in that characters sword menu, meaning I need to back out and select the helm slot and equip that, then back out......just annoys me on a personal level.  Also since it shows the Items in a 3 column menu now selling things can get weird....since if there are no more items listed under one column you can press down on the d-pad and it will not go down, even if there are more items under one of the other two columns, you need to go to that column and then it down.\n\nLook my complaints are minor and I already love this game again, I saw it today, I bought it today, loaded it up right away and it is actually still open in the other window.  I'm currently trying to figure out how late I can play before I need to sleep for work tomorrow....my complaints are minor and really.....let us be honest with eachother, if you're like me....you'll buy it, no matter what....we've been waiting for this a long time and honestly, I love that they kept the SNES sound effects and music....I will be enjoying this for a long time.","December 16, 2015","true","16.2"," 14 of 51 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","14","51","2","0"

The game doesn't crash, and the updated sprites are fine. Anyone surpised by the sprites should have taken the 0 extra seconds it would have taken them to glance at a screenshot.\n\nThe sprites don't look like the originals, which takes a little getting used to, but is completely fine. The translations are better than the original, though I guess different is "bad" in some people's opinion.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Final Fantasy 6 is, in all honesty, my favorate and most beloved game, and I am thrilled to be playing it again, even if it isn't exactly how I remember it visually. The gameplay is still there, the storyline, the characters, and the music!\n\nI will even go so far as to say the new sprites and other visual changes are an improvement, because the characters stand out better and seem more expressive.\n\nOverall, I am thrilled about this game, and I feel anyone whose the least bit interested should give it an honest shot.","December 16, 2015","true","4.1"," 18 of 61 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","18","61","2","0"

As a longtime fan, I really thought that the new sprites would annoy me, but they don't. You get used to them pretty quickly. So far, sprites aside, the game is pretty much as I remembered, which is awesome.\n\nMy ONLY real complaint thus far has to do with the actual app stability as it relates to the controller. I'm using a F310 and the game will suddenly drop my mapping totally. The controls revert back to keyboard, which works just fine. I'm told that people using 360 controllers haven't had a problem so it might just be those with off-brand or knockoffs. If you're going to play this game, do get a legit MS controller. You'll save yourself a major headache.\n\nThat aside, forget the complaints about the sprites or little changes. The essence of the game seems to be intact, which is a very good thing. Skip FF6 and you'll be missing out on a classic.","December 16, 2015","true","22.1"," 13 of 50 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","13","50","0","0"
