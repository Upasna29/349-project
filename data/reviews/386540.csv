Invasion is futuristic top-down shooter that put you in  role of squad leader trying to fight off alien thingies, and save the mankind.\n\nAlthough it is in early access game looks promissing, I cant say it looks great at this moment, but it is decent.\nGraphic is fairly nice, textures and models looks moderate, not great but its not crap, same goes with visual effects shooting and explosions.\n\nGame has good pumped up music, but I do find lacking some voice acting and sound of any interactions, there are none at this point, and I really dont like to read.\n\nAs for gameplay quite few things could impove, such as cutscenes, bigger levels and more variety  of enemies. There are some minor path finding issues ( character floating), not that it affect general playing but it is visible from time to time.\nWould also recommend implementing multiplayer or at least local co-op, Its not very smart shooting and blowing up aliens all alone. ^^\nCool thing is equipement managment that allow you to change gear on you and your team, and very smart ai, basicly your team wont let you down, you're the only one who can screw up the mission :)\n\n\n\nOverall;\nI can rate game at current state only 5/10 there is space for more improvements, as I said it has potentional to be great and fun game if developers are kind to polish it little more.\nIf you want to support developers buy it, otherwise wait to get out of early access.\n\nDisclaimer: Key was provided by developer for testing and reviewing the game.","September 16, 2015","true","6.2"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","23","34","0","5"

Invasion:\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou are the last hope for mankind to reclaim the planet system. In this futuristic top-down shooter, you will be commanding a unit of Special Forces consisting of up to 6 characters to achieve your ultimate goal!\n\nAs this game is on early access, you will be able to play 9 missions which will consist of exploring, defending, escorting a convoy and of course plenty of frantic fighting action. As you progress through the mission you will be able to customize your party of soldiers with different weapons, armour and special items.  I would strongly recommend to get at least 2 healing stations within the party and you will thank me for it! Well, please keep this in the back of your mind. If you misjudge your target and accidently shoot your soldiers, your will be drawing down their health. FRIENDLY FIRE ON!\n\nFor the foes, quite a good selection there. From the mighty Mech (robot) to these little pests of spider robots who will come out at you in huge waves. Remember, FRIENDLY FIRE!\n\nThe controls are mostly Mouse and keyboard in this version but it would seem a gamepad option will be available later on. Also, make sure you familiarise yourself with the individual team order. Master them and it will help you to get to the end of your mission in one piece.\n\nThe graphics are well polished, the levels are nicely designed so far and the futuristic atmosphere is well created. The final version will have up to 20 missions on different planets and a big armada of enemies.\n\nThe games runs well for an early access and the developers are on the ball to rectify any issue you might have. I really look forward to the final version.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Nice graphics\n-	Easy to Control\n-	Fun to play\n-	Already plenty of enemies\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n-	A bit repetitive\n\nA futuristic, fun and fast-paced top-down shooter.

Invasion is a top-down shooter that has you and your squad of soldiers completing different tasks and killing a load of mech robots to reclaim the world.\n\nI'm definitely looking forward to this game coming out of early access over the next few months :D I've only played the first 2 missions at the time of writing this review but so far here are the pros and the cons of the game in my opinion:\n\nPros:\nSmooth Gameplay.\nA lot of action.\nWell structured levels.\nNice graphics.\nGood price.\nIt has an objective marker on the map so you know where to go during missions.\n\nCons:\nWhen in the middle of an objective the map won't display the objective marker which left me exploring a friendly base for like 15 minutes thinking it was the enemy base and I didn't have a clue that the objective was in the opposite direction.\n\nI've edited this review as there was a couple more cons which the developer kindly cleared up for me in a reply to this review.\n\nThis review is based only off the first 2 levels in the game. I recommend this game as I enjoy it a lot but it needs new content quickly otherwise it won't carry a good amount of enjoyment for long.\n\nThis isn't the most detailed review and it might not help you decide if you want to buy it or not so here is some gameplay to hopefully help you decide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8cNRClBqs0 (WARNING: This video may contain spoilers)","August 19, 2015","true","1.5"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","16","24","5","5"

Control of your team mates is ironically handled by the A.I when you're not issuing orders which is done by selecting your "minion" with either aiming your mouse reticle over them and pressing Q or pressing one of the 1-4 keys. Once selected you then hold left shift and press the 1-4 keys to select an appropriate action, ie to follow you or send them over to hold position at where your mouse reticle is.\n\nThis wouldn't be a problem, but there isn't the ability to pause while you're trying to position your squad (while also moving around your own character with WASD) and there's really no reason to use these commands other than to send them forward to engage enemies while you hang around behind them. Doing this slows the game right down into stop and start type gameplay, which contradicts the otherwise fast paced twin stick shooter nature of the game.\n\nSo without utilizing your commands, the combat is very barebones and get's repetitive very quickly.\n\nOne way the command system could be given more use would be to introduce a tactical mode such as that seen in The Red Solstice, in which the game isnt paused completely but slowed down so as to allow the player to position and order their squad without completely halting gameplay. This would have to be balanced with encounters that require a more tactical approach rather than what currently happens in that enemies just rush you. Granted this would affect the flow of the game, but I feel the tactical side of the game is where it's main strength lies and should be focused upon while still trying to maintain the fast paced nature.\n\nIn it's current state I can't recommend this until they add coop, and/or revamp the mechanics and gameplay to better compliment each other.","August 19, 2015","false","0.5"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","24","41","4","4"

Besides the current 6 missions, the full release will have 20 missions on a bigger selection of maps.  You will get intel from the headquarters  to either defend or eleminate A.I's that trys to destory everything that stands for humanity. You will have a option to take and lead each special unit under  your command, to either defend, hold, or attack a selected position while special abilitys to heal or attack will be a option. You do have the option to costumize your special units inventory with either weapons, abilitys and armor.\n\nOverall game design, the environments are fantastic looking, with a deep atmosphere of future feeling. Sadly, this game doesn't offer Co-op or MP, which could be fun. If you like to be a commandor, giving orders and controlling special units to either retrieve intel or help fellow allies on planets, then this game is for you.\n\nHere is a demo:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-Ml_70qPw","August 24, 2015","true","2.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/386540/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEarly Access Review: Will be updated either when big updates are released or when the game is fully released. The current review is representative of it's current state and not of it's future potential.\nA.I. Invasion is a fairly standard top down shooter with some basic tactical elements attached to it. While there is nothing inherrantly wrong with the game, it currently doesn't do enough to make it unique and stand out above the rest.\n\nThe top down shooting element of A.I. Invasion works great. The controls are fluid and it easy to attack whatever enemy you choose. The actual character is controls with WASD controls and the shooting is controlled with your mouse. There is nothing at all wrong with it. I'm a fan of top down shooters so I enjoyed this. The enemy variety is quite large as well meaning you won't get bored of killing the enemies.\n\nThe games strategy element adds a little bit to this experience. You control a fleet of soldiers. Before a mission you are able to select what items you want to equip to each of these soldiers. When in game you can then give orders to each of these in your fleet. You yourself can only ever control your squad leader though. Orders include, "wait here", "follow me", "use special ability" and "everyone follow". They work correctly but I can't help thinking there is a lot more room for commands then these few standard ones.\n\nControls aren't great for these tactical commands either. You have to press "shift + the number of the command" to give the order. The specific soldier can be picked before this by pressing the number of the soldier. The problem I have with this is that the actual controls are only listed in one place. This is on the brief loading screen before the mission. So I found myself guessing which each of the commands did because I forgot. I mean there is a controls options menu but its bland and doesn't go into specific names for commands. I would like for the commands to be listed in a corner of the screen while in game to make it simpler.\n\nI mentioned that you can select different items and abilities for the soldiers as well. These incude a fairly wide variety. The other thing you can select is strength of the armour. I couldn't see however there being any advantage to putting a weaker armour onto a soldier. I ended up just equipping the strongest armour onto all my soldiers and saw no disadvantage.\n\nThe graphics are something that particularly stand out to me though. It has a great futuristic apocalyptic war base look to it that I love. Anamations are perfect and exist throughout the world on things like vegation, trees and water. The water is something i'm particularly fond of. I'm usually quite judgemental of water within games because so many developers do it so poorly. But this game made some beautiful looking water.\n\nIn terms of menu control the game isn't great either. The menu doesn't look particularly advertising in the way it is styled. The most annoying I found about the menu though is the way it handles missions. As far as I could see there is no way to see whether you have already done a mission before. This means you have to remember yourself where your up to which isn't particularly fun.\n\nA.I. Invasion does have a bit of a story to it although it is very basic. I didn't find myself intrigued at all by it really. The story is told through writing throughout the game. It is clear though that it either hasn't been proof read or was written by someone whos primary language isn't English. There are a lot of grammatical mistakes. All in all the story isn't written very well either. They could really do with hiring a dedicated writer to deal with the story.\n\nOverall A.I. Invasion is a solid top down shooter. Although it could do with a lot improvement to it's tactical system and maybe adding something that makes it stand out against it's competitors. Top down shooters are a widely overcrowded market and i'm afraid if they don't do this they won't sell very well. But the price of £6.99 is reasonable for the value of the gameplay currently inside. I enjoyed my time playing but I hope they consider some of the changes.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was provided with a free review key by the developer to make this review.","September 20, 2015","true","3.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","2"
