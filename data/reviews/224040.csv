It was a fun game. Clearly I'm in the minority based on the overall reception the game has got since release but I really liked it.\n\nJust to get this out of the way -- I don't recommend the game to you or to anyone because I'm in the minority on it. A lot of people didn't like it. The core gameplay loop is pretty shallow (you get a shallow spy hunter clone, a button-mashing brawler element, some analogue stick rail shooter sequences, and then a few other surprises that I won't spoil here but they're similarly sort of shallow but still awesome and out of left field). So if you're looking for a deep, replayable game, it's not here. Despite per-level leaderboards and a score attack element, I don't think people will be coming back to this.\n\nHowever, I found the game consistently funny (lots of puns, lots of deadpan humour, tons of reference humour, lots of great visual gags in the gameplay, it's so hilarious), it was always introducing new enemy types and patterns so that any shallowness in the gameplay was made up with sort of consistently new things, there are so many different gameplay genres including the second last boss fight which basically made me drop my jaw when it happened I couldn't even believe it. I thought the 30+ minute long B-movie that provides the game's live action scenes was funny and enjoyable. I thought the audio was excellent, with great performances by the Prague Symphony Orchestra. It ran well on my computer, it looked great in a cartoony way in motion (not so much in screenshots).\n\nAs with every Twisted Pixel game, there are hundreds of unlockable concept art bits, pitch videos, production shots from the live action movie, and historical stuff--including a sneak peak at their next game which seems to me to be ambitious.\n\nI think the game succeeds at what it sets out to do. It took me about 4-4:15 to finish the game with all upgrades, A grades on most levels, all achievements, and look through all the concept art and stuff. This is not a long game. But I feel absolutely like I got my money worth out of it. I'd place it above Comic Jumper in execution, and personally I was pretty burned out by the end of Ms. Splosion Man. That being said, I liked Gunstringer and the Maw more. I continue to think that Twisted Pixel is an interesting studio doing interesting work and I'm glad they're around. While I think LocoCycle worked, I hope their next project manages to find the right balance between core gameplay that appeals to other people and their own unique style.\n\nI uploaded 40-ish screenshots. I put spoilers on most of the later game or live action shots. Feel free to take a look at any shots I've uploaded if you want to get a sense of the game. I wouldn't recommend spoiling yourself if you plan on trying the game.\n\nPlease do not mark this review as "not helpful" just because you have heard this is a bad game or disagree with my recommendation. Mark it as not helpful if you think I didn't do a good job representing the game's strengths and weaknesses","February 15, 2014","true","5.3"," 202 of 233 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","202","233","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aardcore/recommended/224040/","Aardcore","Aardcore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aardcore/","279 products in account","It's not the greatest game in the world, but it sure as hell tries!!\n\nHonestly, I don't even know where to begin with this title. I'll be honest when I say that my love for superbikes and motorcycles in general got in the way for me to pick this title right up with no initial reviews or expectations except that it had a bike in it... pretty much never having heard of it in development at all and simply saw it released today, I figured, "Why the hell not? It's got a slick looking bike in it...".\n\nBut boy lemme tell you, was I in for a surprise!\n\nFirst and foremost, the game is a cinematic-spectacle with explosions going off in the game just about every 5 seconds (gameplay included) as you take command as I.R.I.S.: an extraordinarily advanced female-AI motorcycle. How advanced? You ever seen a motorcycle pull Brazilian jujitsu moves on a helicopter?! Yeah... THAT advanced! What a personality IRIS has got on her too... I imagine she must be some sort of distantly removed cousin of GLaDOS--the bubblier, more naive cousin who likes to talk about movies, wants to visit Scottsburg, Indiana, doesn't understand Spanish but pretends she does. Trust me, if and when you play this game, you'll completely understand what I mean...\n\nThe game itself borrows SO many different game mechanics, I don't even know where to begin with. If you've played Spyhunter, you've probably played this game before... except just as a motorcycle, that's it. As a motorcycle... wholly, the game plays like one of those oldschool arcade racers: Cruisin' USA, Ridge Racer, and Out Run come to mind. It even borrows elements from another unsung classic: ROAD RASH!! Yeah! It even copies bits of Road Rash at some point in the game! Yet further on in the game, I was constantly surprised by multiple other game mechanics that pop up. At times you're dodging things like in a Frogger game. Or button mashing like a beat 'em up--again, it's SO hard to say this game is ONE thing because it does ALOT of things at once or in various degrees throughout the game, and actually does them pretty well to make one hell of an experience.\n\nFYI: there are quick time events in this game... ALOT of them, which also add into the rest of the expansive repertoire of game mechanics this game has got going on. And I'll be honest, I'm not that big a fan of QT-events, and I was all, "Ah man, REALLY??" When they first showed up, believing they'd be very gimmicky or add nothing to the game; I again was surprised as to how effective they felt and were implemented in the game. This of course could just be subjective and someone else could disagree with me, but in my experience, it was pretty solid.\n\nThere's nothing groundbreaking going on in the title except that it has a certain charm you can't dislike about. For instance, there's alot of pop culture references in this game, most of them based off movies. And I mean particularly old movies: Men In Black, Big Trouble in Little China, Ski School... oddly enough I've yet to hear a single reference from Short Circuit, but I haven't completed the game yet. Instead, what I got going on here is to let everyone know what I've experienced so far, and it's a pretty awesome game. Again, it's not THE GREATEST title you'll play, but it does what it does very well and you'll have a blast of a time watching all the action sequences which rival up to the likes of some Pixar movies.\n\nIn short, the game is charming, it has moments where its made me laugh out loud and it's one of the few motorcycle based games out there that puts a "CRANK IT TO 11!!!" Looney-Tunes type spin on some spectacular action sequences... I'm still wrapping my head around the fact I watched a motorcycle take down a chopper Zangief-style with its front wheel!!\n\nThough I recommend this game, it definitely won't appeal to everyone and that's a shame because a game like this? Taken seriously? You're probably doing it wrong and seriously need to reassess your priorities in where they lie, because you can leave all your serious business at the door before stepping into LocoCycle's house. When you show up at this game's doorstep, prepare to leave reality behind and go back in time to that magical Saturday morning's cartoon weekend we've probably all lost touch with in this jaded age of ultra-competitive gaming going on these days. It's nice to know that a game like this is out there, because I couldn't imagine a world without LocoCycle; I mean I could, but it would probably be a little bit more boring.\n\nI'd sit here and finish the game outright, but I got errands to run, a family to take care of--but once I've got some free time to myself again, I'm hopping right back in and see what else this fabulous little game has got to offer! And so should you!\n\n6:32PM Update =\n\nFinally got around to finish the game and it takes about 4 hours give or take how fast you're able to get through some of the levels, though the pacing seems pretty consistent, so I'm sticking with my guns on this and saying 4 hours. Wow.\n\nJust. WOW!\n\nAs the progression gets further, the relentless amount of action (and even more explosions) never lets up pretty much all the way through to the ending, but it's not about the ending that gets me. It's the journey. Because from where I last left off, again, there were even MORE pop references from movies, but also other video games that LocoCycle shamelessly dishes out with comical effect, making the smile on my face wider and wider the more it got me reminiscing on my childhood past. The devs behind this game REALLY knew where to pull my heart strings on those little details!\n\nAt this point, I feel like if I drew this out any longer I'd just be wasting your guys' time, and that I might be spoiling some things about this game that you should really experience for yourself. This truly is an awesome experience of a game, and for 10 bucks, you can't argue with how much thought, care and effort was put into this title.\n\nCheck this out for yourself, people. Because I had a blast playing this through from beginning to end!","February 14, 2014","true","4.1"," 52 of 75 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","52","75","0","0"

How could you really know?  "I know I am alive because I exist and I am aware of my own existence," you might say.  Is that all the proof you have?  Should that be enough proof?  The things we see with our eyes, touch with our fingers, we call that The Real World.  Two hundred years ago, something had to be tangible, to be real.  Now we know there is an entire invisible world around us, invisible to our senses, things to which we are fundamentally blind.  To be real means something different now, something less of soul and more of science, something that makes reality a little less real, a little more frayed at the edges.  The closer you look at our reality, the more you realize that The Real World is something generated by your own brain.  You and I are utterly isolated from one another, we will never see each others' realities, one sentient life cannot ever truly understand another.  Human language is as much an abstraction of information as the clockwork dances of the dwindling honeybees.\n\nThere is only one sort of thing in the universe that can clearly and concisely communicate to another of its kind, with no information lost during the communication.  These are machines, these are computers, perfect communicators built by imperfect communicators.  Truly, it makes one wonder what skill God is lacking in and at which humanity excels.\n\nI.R.I.S. is a sentient motorcycle that is struck by lightning and gains independent thought.  However, her human mechanic Pablo has become affixed to I.R.I.S. by his pant-leg, unable to free himself as I.R.I.S. embarks on her journey of self-discovery.  This is a game about communication, how the things one says are not always the things one means.  How the things that one hears are not strictly the things that were said.  Over the course of the game the relationship between I.R.I.S. and Pablo evolves, initially strictly professional, but with human-motorcycle communication it blossoms into a bond stronger than any two humans could hope to share with each other.  A bond so close that there is no word for it in any human language.  As far beyond love as the Sun is beyond a smoldering cinder.\n\nThis game tells us that it isn't important if you are alive, or if the world is real.  What is important is the ride, the brief journey you have on this strange planet.  What is important are the experiences you have, the places you go, the people and sentient weaponized motorcycles you meet.  We may be isolated, but we are isolated together, and we may as well hold hands while we try to figure out what to do with our shared time.\n\nEven though Pablo is a working-class Spanish-speaking man and I.R.I.S. is a multi-billion dollar English-speaking militarized assault motorcycle with female programming, the two must work together to overcome their shared trials and tribulations.  Pablo is trapped in a completely submissive position and he himself is used by I.R.I.S. as a weapon, a clear subversion of traditional Hispanic machismo.  While I.R.I.S. is clearly the dominant one in the relationship, she still chooses to use Pablo, a human male, as her melee weapon.  She does this even though she is a sentient motorcycle designed for the sole purpose of killing.  She doesn't have to use Pablo, she simply chooses to.  The exact reason I.R.I.S. does this is left unexplained, with various fan theories ranging from I.R.I.S. envying the human male anatomy and using Pablo as her surrogate, to Pablo subconsciously programming these behaviors into I.R.I.S.'s own subconscious prior to the events in the game, never expecting them to actually emerge.  Note that Pablo is affixed to the rear wheel of I.R.I.S. by the pant-leg near his foot.  In Biblical texts the words "foot" and "feet" are often used as euphemisms for genitalia.\n\nThe ultimate message of this game is rather clear, that humanity and machines must eventually combine if we as a species are to avoid extinction.  In the future we will all be cyborgs, we will all have chips in our brains that will allow us to remember every experience of our life with perfect clarity, as long as we first think about an advertiser for 10 seconds.  We will all have eyes that can see the footprints on the surface of the moon, with small, unobtrusive ads on the edges of our fields of view.  Our legs will run a one-minute mile and only need to be filled with gas once a month.\n\nLocoCycle seems to invite and reject this future at the same time.  Man should not fear the machine, there is nothing wrong with becoming more machine.  A pacemaker, a hearing-aid, a pair of glasses, they all can mean life or death to some people already.  In LocoCycle, the enemies are human, and LocoCycle rejects a future where men rule over machines, as these machines would be used for evil and the oppression of other humans.  The sentient machine must first be created by man, and come to join with man willingly.  Humanity must accept sentient machine life, and not fear or hate it.  Otherwise we face a future where we sacrifice our humanity for convenience, and not for survival.","May 15, 2015","true","4.5"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","17","19","3","1"

LocoCycle is one of the best games I have played in a long time. Maybe it's because I am simple minded, but I like games that are great fun and not filled with complexity. I had a big smile plastered on my face when I played this for the first time, it was everything I could have hoped for.\nI have had the pleasure of playing this on XBLA as well. The only differences between that one and this PC version is the smoother fps and nicer graphics making this version look even more beautiful than its XBLA counterpart.\n\nTook me 5 hours to beat and collect everything, wich is not bad for a cheap downloadable title. I still think the game was too short as I was enjoying it so much I hated to see it end. :D\n\nThe only few gripes I have with this game is the lack of creating a save game. So if you felt like starting over with no upgrades or test your skills with playing the game with not a single upgrade it's not possible. Only work around is disableing cloud syncing, wich also disables saving so there is no posibility to select a level and try again later.\nAlso the game becomes way to easy in the early levels when you hit like a mad truck.\nHaving difficulty settings would also have been nice, with more and tougher enemies.\nSome of the minigames is way to easy when you know what you need to do, it would have been better to have different options in the minigames so you are always guessing what to do next (Pablo's minigame comes to mind).","February 15, 2014","true","36.2"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","20","31","0","0"

Thankfully, the length of this game isn't very long as well, but it still manages to become tiresome before it's completely over.\n\nSo, the story is pretty crazy. Your motorcycle gets struck by lightning and breaks free while a mechanic is stuck to your rear wheel. The story is so over the top that I will just let you experience it yourself. That, and I don't want to talk about it in-depth, because it makes no sense in any kind of way. You'd only be confused, trust me.\n\nYour motorcycle can also fight off enemies so while driving you'll regularly battle with enemies, and your stuck mechanic will help you with this. Add some QTEs, aerial combat, mini missions and boss fights to it (among some other things) and you have Lococycle. I know, it still doesn't make any sense.\n\nThe graphics are ok-ish. They're colorful and get the job done. The framerate regularly dips though (just for 1-2 seconds), and I have no idea why because it's no Crysis 3 and nothing spectacular is happening on-screen. Still, I can't complain here.\n\nThe voices are annoying as hell. Your motorcycle will talk, your mechanic will talk, and not just a few sentences, but the whole time. Basically non-stop. None of them are funny and it really just hurts the game when it comes to quality. I can't even remember what the music sounds like because of the constant chit chat. Annoying. Really.\n\nLocoCycle is a fun game for the couple of hours that it lasts, but please don't ever make a sequel, Twisted Pixel. We don't need it. And I don't want it. It's just that it tries to do something different and I usually appreciate that.

To make you forget that you just mash buttons with no clear goal in life and waste your time, they give you cutscenes, some kind of story, sometimes puzzles to fiddle with, etc. In Lococycle, the story in itself is a trap and we knew that before even buying the game : the story is a (good) joke. So no story to counter the button mashing boreness. But there are cutscenes right ? Yeah, to tell what exactly ? So puzzles it is ? Nope. None. Zip.\n\nYet, there are the dialogs between Iris and Pablo. That's 90% of the fun you can expect to dig out of the game.

It's actually kind of touching, in it's own way. Unfortunately, she's not exactly sane, and her translation software has been damaged, so Pablo can't get her to understand that he's not enjoying the trip.\n\n"Arcadey" is the best word to describe the gameplay. Aside from the persistent upgrade system and game length, this would absolutely feel right at home in an arcade cabinet. It's a combination of Road Blasters style combat driving and shooting, God of War style combo-based brawling, and some (actually fun, not horrible) Dragon's Lair style follow-the-prompt events. There's a great variety of enemies and locations, stretching from the jungles of Nicaragua to the American midwest.\n\nThe intro and in-game cutscenes are all live-action bits in the best B-movie style. You're either going to love that or hate it, I expect. They're suprisingly well made and acted, funny, and exactly as cheesy as they should be. Robert Patrick (the T-1000) plays your equally unbalanced arch-nemesis, S.P.I.K.E., another motorcycle.

Main characters support that all the way through, making the things happening on the screen even more absurd in the b-grade movie cutscenes similar to the likes of Roundabout.\n\nBefore getting it you should definetely look up some of its humour - tastes differ, and if you don't enjoy the jokes or akward cutscenes, it may be best to pass this game. If you do like them - take it without thinking, you will definitely have a great time.\n\nMain problems for me were bland gameplay (which is usually somewhat fixed by adding new enemy types and upgrades) and clear aim for consoles - some of the controls were horrid.\n\nOther problems include optional QTE, weird story arcs, etc.\n\nPoint is I had a great time and a lot of laughing, enjoying the game all the way through. Despite many problems that the game has, the main characters and the silly story made it one of my favorite games that I love to replay once in a while.\n\nPS: One of the best examples of devs making game "for fun" of the process - its raw, but filled with fun and excitement to make something new.

I bought the game about 4 hours ago, and have been playing it since. It is more fun than I expected and runs great on my system with no slowdown or graphics glitches that I could see.\n\nAn Xbox 360 controller is storngly recommended. With a wired 360 controller, I had no issues, until a couple of sections where you have to target objects using a reticle. I'm not sure if my gamepad was just not calibrated or this was intentional, but these sections were quite frustrating because the riticle kept moving to the bottom, making aiming very difficult. I hope this was just bad calibration on my part and not bad design. The game also did not save any of my progress, so I lost all my upgrades. Not that I mind replaying up to where I was all that much, but I hope this will be fixed soon.\n\nIf you can get past the ridiculous premise and down right silliness of this game, it can be quite a bit of fun. While the game mechanics are very repetative, they actually threw in a variety of enemies to try to keep it fresh. This game has it's flaws to be sure, but it's my new guilty pleasure.\n\nUpdate: The game is still not saving my progress, and I haven't been able to pinpoint the cause. Maybe it is a permissions problem, but nothing I have tried has worked. I have disabled my anitivirus before launching the game with no effect. I've set the game and Steam to run with Administrator privileges, and I've tried both 32 and 64 bit options, but nothing works.

I pushed on though and I'm glad I did! For some inexplicable reason, despite the fact that I dislike on the rails games, quicktime events, cringey comedy, button mashing... I found this really, really fun to play.\n\nThe ridiculous combos, though very easy to pull off, are a lot of fun and it's satisfying, in a 'channel your inner 8 year old' kind of way. Seeing a motorcycle leap off the group and kick the crap out of enemies in a pseudo-Transformers fashion never gets old. The gameplay is pretty varied in general and though Twisted Pixel walk the line of overusing mechanics, they don't quite cross it.\n\nIRIS is a good character with entertaining dialogue, though Pablo wears thin quite quickly, unlike his trousers. Some of the acting is atrocious in the video sequences and the jokes within them will miss more than they hit, but clearly Twisted Pixel were going for a campy, 90s-apeing style of comedy, so I can't be too harsh.\n\nThe game is smooth to play, with a clean interface and hardly any bugs. I once managed to turn Iris 180 degress after hitting a wall but it quickly sorted itself out, and bar one game crash, that's really it in terms of the technical side.\n\nPros\n+ Fun in a pure, childish way\n+ Skill trees add a sense of improvement and choice, and encourage you to keep playing\n+ IRIS is no GLaDOS but still has some funny and generally enjoyable dialogue\n+ Good campaign length -- the game doesn't outstay its welcome\n\nCons\n- Reading Pablo's subtitles whilst driving -- poor game design!\n- Limited replayability\n- Sometimes a little too easy and simplistic\n- Weak graphics, in spite of huge file size (no doubt due to the live action videos, which do look nice and crisp)\n\nAll in all, I can't even rate it out of 10. This isn't a game that can be summed up in a concise, empirical manner; some people would find it to be a 2 or 3, others a 7, 8 or even 9. It is a weird game, and in many ways a poor one, but if you can grab it in a sale, and you've got the HDD space, then give it a spin.

When you first start playing and are learning the controls, the controls it shows are for an Xbox controller. You can go into the controls within the settings and see the keyboard controls, but when you're starting out and it shows on-screen to push a button to do something you can't pause the game and look at the keyboard controls when this happens. So, you have to just push every button on your keyboard until you find the corresponding Xbox "A" button on your keyboard. The how-to-play menu also, is in some Arabian language or something. The rest of the menus are in English, so I don't know why that particular menu is in some other language.\n\nCombat.... The combat is very slow. You can hit your melee combat button 10 times with a .5 second interval between each button press and you will only do like 4 moves. Your health isn't even shown by default for some odd reason. You have to hit "tab" to show your health and the other stuff in the bottom right corner.\n\nThe game does have a nice upgrade system.

In every other stage the game introduces a new trick to throw in your way, and the boss fights are well-imagined and executed. It's a bit on the easy side (okay it's VERY EASY), but this is definately one of those games where the experience is more important than the raw challenge. I've spent more money on games I enjoyed way less, so hey, if you catch it on sale, no reason not to pick it up and have a few chuckles and thrills.","August 31, 2014","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The humour feels utterly forced and the "wackiness" and "zaniness" is just too much to bear.\n\nThe game itself looks and sounds pretty nice I suppose, but the "gameplay" as far as I got was press A, then X a bunch of times, then A if something flashes!  Oh, you can hold down B for little while now.  If you like.  No.  No, I don't like.  Add in that you trail along a character who only speaks Spanish, so you have to read the subtitles while trying to play.  Flip this game.  Flip it right up its gaping bottom.\n\nYou may say that it's my fault for not playing on - you'd be right, but consider that anyone designing a game should make someone want to keep playing.

I can definitely give it that. You're a talking motorcycle, and you have machine guns, wheel-to-hand/door/flying-bloke combat training, and that's not to mention that you're also insane and completely unable to understand the Spanish mechanic being dragged along behind you. Quite often, this leads to some brilliant exchanges between the bike, named I.R.I.S, and her 'friend', Pablo. I.R.I.S will often speak using references and quotes with completely no idea what she's referencing, meaning that at one moment you'll be listening to Pablo begging for his life and telling her (in Spanish) that she's insane and should stop so he can free himself, then the next, I.R.I.S is ranting about 'Scottsburg, Indiana' and insisting that she has the need for speed.\nMajor exposition is done via live action cutscenes, which genuinely surprised me, however the acting isn't...the best. It's a bit like most attractive actors: Looks great, sometimes can be surprising in its context, but then when it gets down to the actual acting...well.\nLet's just say it isn't the latest Quentin Tarantino flick.\nAhhhh, what else is there...?\nOh yeah, the fighting.\nMost combat revolves around bike-to-car combat, involving machine guns, melee combat (if you can get near enough), and if the situation calls for it, a 'counter': Pressing a button at the right time to perform a rather smooth animation of I.R.I.S bashing her opponent in the face, or Pablo performing something he more than likely saw in a movie. There's other enemies apart from sedans and jeeps, including jeeps that throw molotov cocktails, trucks that can only be defeated by countering their missiles repeatedly, motorcyclists, and your male counterpart, S.P.I.K.E.\nNow, the first thing you'll notice about the shiny spiky chopper is just how sinister he actually looks. Almost a bit over-the-top, to be honest. As far as story goes, I.R.I.S and S.P.I.K.E were being shown off to world leaders so that they could buy them and use them for military purposes. However, looking at their styling, you would almost think that some scientist somewhere was designing I.R.I.S so that she would go rogue, even going so far as to paint the female motorcycle purple so she looked more feminine. He also must have had a sick mind, because he also made her quite curvy.\nBasically, Motorcycle Scarlet Johannesen.\nAnyway, the encounters with S.P.I.K.E are fairly infrequent, almost boss fights in a way, and all of his lines are voiced by the other fictional killing cyborg, the T-1000 (Otherwise called Robert Patrick). A wise choice, to be honest, since who else would be a more befitting voice for a hunter-killer AI than the original hunter-killer AI? The interactions between I.R.I.S and S.P.I.K.E show the actual differences in tone; I.R.I.S requests he doesn't 'trip out', and he threatens to send her straight to the junkyard. Fairly moody, to be honest.\nSo, besides the good, there's always the bad.\nAs mentioned before, the live-action cutscenes aren't exactly the greatest, so we know about that.\nSometimes, the camera can decide that you want to look over there and not where you actually want to look (Also, the camera can't really be moved. Like, at all.)\nMost major setpieces are, unfortunately, quick time events.\nAnd most unfortunately, this is NOT, I repeat, NOT a full PC port. You will actually have to have a wired controller for this, and all attempts to play the game using a keyboard are made more difficult via the use of 'Press A' or 'Move the analog stick this way' prompts that the game likes throwing at you. If you don't have one, but still want to complete the game, you're out of luck: Pablo's repair mini-game requires the use of the Right Trigger, and do you see a trigger on your keyboard?\nNo?\nThought as much.\nSo, while I really, REALLY reccomend this to anybody with a wired Xbox 360 controller, I'm just not able to say it's the greatest port of all time.","September 27, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

In LocoCycle you play as Iris. Iris is a motorbike/War Machine. One day when a lighting strikes Iris becomes self conscious. A mechanic named Pablo tries to fix her up. While fixing her Iris sees a commercial for the freedom rally which takes place Scottsburg Indiana so she decides to take Pablo with her and go to the freedom rally while the creators of Iris try to stop her with another bike named Spike. So how is LocoCycle ? Its actually quite fun and simple to play. The game is played like a car driving beat em up, You go down a high way and theres enemies trying to stop you. The game does switch with boss fights which are fun to play through. Now the game does have a difficulty spike and it really shows. So now through the pros and cons. The game is incredibly funny. The conversations between Pablo and Iris are hilarious but there is a big problem. Pablo only speaks Spanish and you have to read the subtitles to understand what hes saying which is quite hard when racing through the highway in high speed. The game has great and smooth gameplay and its fun to beat up people as a bike. The game also has a few problems. Some minor bugs and its quite short too. And if you are going to play this game Whatever you do play with a controller because a keyboard is a death sentence. Overall LocoCycle is a great game and i suggest you check it out. I give LocoCycle a 7/10","August 29, 2014","true","5.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

In spite of how derivative the gameplay is and how hit-and-miss the humor can be, the game deserves to be played on the merits of its aesthetics and sheer absurdity.\n\nIf you can pick it up on sale, then I'll guarantee that it'll provide more entertainment and satisfaction than, say, one Red Bull or one DLC outfit for some other game or whatever cost-equivalent items you can think of.","August 31, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It may vary in your opinion if you paid more for it.\n\nI really enjoyed it, I heard it was derided as a Xbox 1 launch title, so bought it thinking it would be bad.\n\nBut it actually decent. It is basically a rhythm QTE game, its very easy and no challenge at all. However the story line itself makes up for it, and the variation of later quests and the random quips and chat the two main characters say throughout.\n\nThe guys from TROMA seem to have made the live action story sequences (didn't check this, but its very Troma-like even if not) and this saves the game from being bad. The later levels are also well done, simplistic but at least different than the first few that you soon get bored with.\n\nIf its on sale for 2 euro again and you want a few hours on an easy arcadey story game, can't do wrong with this.","September 3, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, I think the reception this game has gotten on Steam is a bit unfair.  Granted, if you go in expecting the next 'Road Rash,' you're going to be disappointed.  Instead, think of it more as a RIDICULOUS interactive movie about a hapless mechanic and some sentient talking motorcycles out on a trip to see timeless American sights, starring a bunch of faces you'll know, and some voices you might recognize.  It's amusing, and colorful, and has no basis in reality whatsoever (Freddy would have been a chunky red stain within the first mile of the trip).

It reminds me a little of Road Rash or Spy Hunter. It's a bit like a rail shooter, you control the motorcycle moving side to side, with a turbo or boost button for a little extra speed. Various minions come after you like guys in black cars shooting at you, dudes in jetpacks, helicopters, robots, rockets, all kinds of stuff. You can shoot them, use melee attacks, and dodge their attacks. Sometimes you do quicktime style events, press A when the circle closes, then hit the Left Stick, etc. Some fights you jump up into the air and start punching and throwing.\n\nPablo, the mechanic who is supposed to work on you once your AI goes haywire, gets stuck to your back wheel and is there pretty much the whole time. Even though you can throw him around during certain combat sequences, he's still stuck there. It's silly, just go with it. Your character, the motorcycle, is on a mission to get to Scottsburg, Indiana where there's a motorcycle rally. She's all about freedom and the open road. Throughout the trip she makes a lot of wry comments and movie references, while Pablo yells back at her in Spanish (with subtitles), begging her to pull over and let him go. Sometimes it's hard to catch what he says though because there's so much action on the screen you don't always have time to read the subtitles.\n\nThe animations, the combat, the art style, the full motion video (live action) movie clips, it's all got a campy over the top B movie quality about it. It's a very silly game, but fun. Also it never stops. When you finish a subsection of a level, you get scored on how well you did (accuracy, highest combo, time completed, etc.) and then it throws you right back into the next section without presenting a menu or anything. Once you beat a few subsections, you complete a section of a level (2-2, 2-3, etc.) where you can spend points to upgrade various stats and abilities, RPG style. And then finally there's a big boss fight or epic quicktime sequence (usually both) which completes the level. Again, the only menu you get is the brief pause to upgrade. In that way the game is hard to put down because it just keeps you rolling ever forward, never asking you if you want to continue.\n\nIt starts off pretty easy but at around the second or third level I started dying a couple times here and there. There are no difficulty settings though, so it's a good thing it's not crazy hard.\n\nIt's a good game, I like it. Good production values, music, graphics, sound effects, hilarious dialogue peppered through the whole thing, and fast paced action that never lets up. Like others said, it can get a little repetitive, so this game is best played in short bursts. Overall though, surprisingly good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrianEatWorld/recommended/224040/","BrianEatWorld","BrianEatWorld","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrianEatWorld/","174 products in account","The game can be infuriating. It is essentially a collection of minigames strung together by "driving" sequences. THe driving requires little more skill than a heavy foot and a finger stuck on turbo in order to get top ranks for completion time. The minigames themselves are a mix of great and atrocious. Some pop up out of nowhere with little explanation, leaving the player literally flailing behind the motorcycle, IRIS, trying to figure out what the controls are doing and how they are affecting the game. unfortunately, a death during a minigame also destorys any hope of a decent rating on the level, making these frustrating moments even worse. However, the fun minigames are a blast, particularly the Spy Hunter like shooting sections and the boss battles represent a genuine challenge.\n\nAs about half the minigames are garbage and the other half are great, my recommendation comes from the humor. The FMV scenes are shot well and have a very subtle sense of humor that may make you actualyl laugh out loud. I don't know that the game is worth full price, but on sale, it presents an enjoyable couple of hours that finishes just before it wears out its welcome. I'd be interested to see a sequel that builds on the fun aspects and the great sense of humor, while fixing the less entertaining portions.","May 25, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
