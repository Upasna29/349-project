Sadly, it didn't.\n\nUpon opening the game, you find two options - "choose a level" and "shop."\n\nFirstly, I went into "shop" where it appeared there was no currency, 6 items of clothing to choose from (which I couldn't see anyway while playing the game) and about 5 different frames, all of which were 1 brand, with numerous spelling and grammar errors in the descriptions. It was also unclear whether the different bikes, ranging from enduro through freeride to downhill, would actually handle any differently.\n\nAfter trying desperately to find out whether it was actually possible to buy anything in the shop, I decided to actually play the game. After clicking "choose track" I was met with a screen of numbers. I clicked on "1." Then I clicked on it again. And again. And again. After about a minute, during which there was no load bar, beachball of death, or other means of telling me the map was loading, I found myself at the top of a track made of early 2000s graphics, prompted with a brief note on the controls, and set into action. There was no sound, the bike handled weirdly, the track looked like a 2 pixel pavement, and I was forced to quickly close the game and ask steam for a refund.\n\nIf you're a fellow rider looking for a game to play, I suggest MX vs ATV reflex, also available on steam, or real life.\n\nTL;DR: I wouldn't play it if it was free, let alone pay for it.","May 27","false","0.1"," 65 of 98 people (66%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","66","65","98","8","5"

Either I am crazy good at this game or this is the easiest game I have played on steam. Now I am hopped up on caffine and was listeing to drum and bass throughout the whole thing but still I got all the way to level 14 in exactly 1 hour. So there either needs to be more levels or the difficulty seriously needs to be upped other than that it was fun but so quick. Level 12 was the best most difficult but other than that it was all way too easy. I will still give a thumbs up but devs better come up with some more levels. Also if they could add some drum and bass really makes you feel like the flash when you blazing down trails.","June 1","true","2.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Boy was I wrong The controls in the game were clunky and at time unresponsive. I understand that this game is early in its life but come on not including sound when riding the bike! that is something that should have been added in a beta at least. I didn't play the game enough to get a feel for the store or all the levels but that isn't going to change the review as these can't change the game core physics unless the different bikes change how you ride(only would change it a bit).  If you want to ride a MTB start small this game is doing it no justice go out to your local trail have some fun with some friends no matter your ability there is something for you to do. I may take another look at this game again in the future if they do a physics overhaul but until then im keeping the money that I refunded from this game and spending it hopefully on something better (can't stuff up two times in a row ;)  )\n\nTL;DR : Core of game didn't work as expected, got refund.
