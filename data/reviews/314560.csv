I hadn't seen any comparisons with DS before I bought it, but so far into my play time that's the game it reminds me of the most. It bears more resemblance to that for me than Diablo/Grim Dawn. That's just my opinion, of course.\n\nEDIT: Arkash Legacy is an obvious game that seems similar, but that is far more tactical with battles than this game, so I don't feel there is much similarity between those two.\n\nThe customisation options are great. I like how you can have your characters be anything you want, because it always allows you to redefine your attribute points in each character. Gang of archers? Ok. Bunch of wizards? Fine. I'm going with the builds I was given at the moment, but hey, it's there to use if I want to, which is cool.\n\nThere are areas of plentiful enemies, and the pause system is often helpful. Ok, so it's a 'slow time,' and not an actual pause, but it's as good as, and although it runs on a meter, it's a generous one.\n\nGraphics are nice. I'm not a fan of cartoony visuals, but that's just the portraits, so I can live with that. Also, you can pan around the map but you cannot rotate it - I know we are spoiled with map rotate in games, so it takes a few minutes to adjust to not being able to do that.\n\nQuests are good - you get the choice to finish up, but if you carry on exploring you will discover more. They also have a bit of veriaty. One quest (getting people to the sled) involves keeping waves of enemies at bay while rounding up villagers. You find yourself playing the game differently; I enjoyed the change of pace on that quest.\n\nYou can ressurect any dead ally, so any guards you find lying about the place can be brought back to life. Handy if you do the old 'run to town' trick with a bunch of aggro!\n\nThe trade system takes a minute to get used to. The trade window is small, and gets obscured by the stats of any item you hovver over...could do with appearing away from the trade window. Also, try not to hover over the mouse buttons...I accidently right-clicked and bought an expensive and useless (for me) itemthat made me re-load a save!\n\nI have seen one puzzle so far, which did require a bit of random to-ing and fro-ing, but this is a puzzle-combat game, so I expected that.\n\nEDIT: Actually, I admit - I had to watch a 'how-to' on YouTube! I had been trying to work out an order of button pressing for about half an hour and gave up. TBH the solution seemed kind of random, but five hours in that's the only head-scratcher I've encountered so far.\n\nWould I recommend? For this price, hell yes! It seems cheap for the quality, so I would say get this at this price without a worry.","July 29, 2015","true","5.5"," 154 of 178 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","154","178","6","11"

Visually it is a treat and for the most part the game is great.  Many people like it and gave it good reviews and they are fine.\n\nI have never had so much trouble deciding if to recommend a game or not as I have with this game, there is nothing wrong in partiular with the game, just a lot of little things that add up to making me regret my purchase.  I undersatnd the combat and the skills after playing games like Pillars of Eternity and enjoy the system, but it feels totally unblanced and bland, many skills being worthless and only being able to equip 2 skills and 1 feed skill per character at any time feels limiting.\n\nThe maps are linear which is fine, but they feel too big for what they are and many times you find yourself going exploring expecting to find something cool only to be met with a dead end and nothing there.  Which brings me to chests.  To open a chest the team 'attack it' which seems odd considering chest have hinges and handles and could be just opened, it felt like they ran out of time to make an opening chest animation.\n\nAlso the loot is very boring, 90% crafting material and not much actual gear.  Which is fine, because there is a lot of things to craft, but again, with the crafting the loot drops are pointless because you can buy all the crafting material from the vendor next to the crafter.  It just feels unecessary.\n\nIs a shame cause I was really excited to play the game, but it just feels like an early access title to me, which to the developers credit they are doing a stellar job listening to the community and are in the process of adding a rotating camera, so I still hold hope of being able to finish the game one day, but added to the long load times every time you die I simply do not have the drive to play the game.  I really want to get into it, but like a word you are on the brink of remembering I just cannot find that spark.\n\nTL:DR it is not a bad game, in fact in many ways it is good, but sadly it lacks atmosphere.","August 2, 2015","false","5.9"," 153 of 192 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","153","192","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/314560/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","Note: - This game has been provided to me for free for review purposes.OverviewKyn is a top down strategy view type real time adventure role-playing game. You play as two special warriors who just managed to escape alive from some sort of gauntlet and return to their village to find a normally peaceful tribe of orc-like creatures suddenly turned red and became aggressive.\n\nThe Pros:Strategic Gameplay - Kyn uses the Baldur's Gate concept of controlling all or individual characters, and being able to pause time to give orders. However, here you can only slow time for a limited time, so you must be quick. Also, you will find yourself in situations where a good strategy is the only way to win.\n\nPuzzles! - Kyn has a good number of challenging puzzles. These mainly involve splitting your party, pressing puttons, and trying to reach a checkpoint. It really makes you think and it's a nice break from the usual fighting.\n\nMaps - This game is not open world, but rather splits the story into chapters, and you get to visit a decently sized map each chapter. It's great as you get to explore new areas each time and makes you want to do so, as there are goodies hiding in the corners, and you can't return to a map once finished.\n\nHumor - The story is decent, and the developers sneaked in a few good jokes too, sometimes breaking the fourth wall too.\n\nFocus on Gameplay, not character - The skill system is lacking on purpose because it makes it very easy to build your characters right away or switch between game styles. The game wants you to fight and be a good strategist, not a overly careful build planner.\n\nExcellent Level Design - The maps are unique, very detailed, and the level design was very well executed. The props have good hit boxes, you won't get trapped in clutter, villages seem practical, all in all a great environment.  Graphically pleasing too.\nThe Cons:Generic Characters - The characters don't really impress me. Most of them are simple, linear beings with only a few character traits. You won't get attached to them.\n\nOK story, decent storytelling, but missing that spark. - I can't say the story elements are bad, but nothing was that special to really get me into it. A lot of the time, the dialogues failed to capture my attention, even if other times they did. Ultimately it's up to you if you want to go through the story or just skip it entirely, the game will be fun nonetheless.\n\nSeemingly Complicated Crafting System. - Between missions, you return to your town to craft stuff for your party. You are presented with many crafting components, but as you progress you will find there is no need to worry, as you will gather plenty of them, making scavenging simply a byproduct of gameplay.\n\nIdiotic take on death? - Without giving spoilers, the story has a few deaths and the characters seem pretty devastated by them - yet the first skill you're available to use from THE START OF THE GAME is revival. You even have some quests involving reviving some NPC who died attacked by creatures or whatnot. You can even revive dead guards. But a main character dies, and suddenly your party is sad. Why? Just revive the damn corpse!\nBonus Points:This is a two person indie game - Serious props to the two friends who had a vision together. The end product is very impressive for a team that small. Good job, guys!\nConclusion:Kyn is not perfect. It has good points, it certainly has bad points, but it's a nice RPG that holds about 25-30 hours of gameplay and it's a goog combination between thinking and pure action.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more of my recommended games, you can view my reviews here, and be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","December 5, 2015","true","4.8"," 43 of 50 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","43","50","4","1"

(my first ever)\n\nI have done about 5 missions now, and what an AWESOME game.\nNot only to be created by no less than 2 people, which is a feat worth applause in my opinion.\n\nPros & Improvements\n\n+ created by 2 people\n+ gameplay is effective and works (no bugs as for me so far)\n+ not a 3 hour game (looking at my 9,4 hours of gameplay, which includes side quests, and being at the 5th mission)\n+ smooth map scrolling\n+ the slow time effect DOES give you an strategic advantage (if used correctly ofcourse)\n\n+/- map rotation is a bit of an obstacle (since when looking for chest some trees dont dissappear / fade)\n+/- no option to choose what kind of character /class you want to begin with (so you need to equip your character\nyourself with desired equipment)\n+/- I had one chrash so far (dont know what caused it tho, could be my pc)\n+/- Somehow at loading screens it looks like the pc is not responding for just a little time and then it works again.

You got a party up to 6 people and each of them have 2 skills + a bonus skill which means a lot of micro-management (which would be okay since you can pause the game, at least for a short time) but they don't even auto-attack the enemy! My archer died because he was just standing there looking into the sky while 2 people shot him to death. It seems you also got to tell him to attack someone after you use a skill like heal. It also seems that the game was not 100% translated into german since there are still a lot of english words in the game(feels weird).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/314560/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","I was pretty excited when I heard about Kyn, being a lover of nearly all things Viking/Nordic. However, when I saw the game description mention "strategy", I put off purchasing the title because I'm fairly crappy with strategy style games. I wish the Developers would change this inaccuracy, since Kyn is simply an overhead RPG along the lines of Pillars of Eternity, Divinity: Original Sin and Diablo.\n\nThere are a lot of ups and downs when it comes to Kyn. On the one hand, I want to recommend it because it's a fun title with vast, beautiful levels (maps) that are unique to one another. You'll have a great time exploring the large open areas and completing the many side quests along the way.\n\nOn the other hand, many of the exciting elements of an RPG are put on the back-burner. Such as leveling, which is usually exciting and leaves you feeling accomplished. There are only 3 attributes for you to put your skill points into each time you level up, which will only happen after you complete main missions. The entire concept of leveling within this game is mediocre. It doesn't even matter how many monsters you slay or people you help along the way.\n\nAnother down note of Kyn are the items. Most of the time when you loot a chest, you'll get a little bit of gold and some crafting items; rarely will you see any gear, let alone rare items. You'll spend quite a bit of time gathering crafting items to finally be able to make something, too. This takes the fun out of wanting to explore and open treasure chests. When the Developers boast a "rich and deep" crafting system on the store page, I was expecting something a little more. You won't even be able to craft anything for at least the first three or four levels.\n\nThe story is also rather bland and disappointing. There's not much to say about it at all. There's also barely anything Viking/Nordic about this game except for a few references and symbols scattered here and there. Since I've listed more cons than I have pros in this review, I am going to not recommend Kyn at this point. It's a fun game, for sure, but when other games such as Pillars of Eternity and Divinity: Original Sin are out there, selling at around the same market value as this game (if you're smart about purchasing), Kyn just does not have what it takes to stand out.\n\nEdit: I have encountered a series of bugs, however minor they may be they are still quite irritating. One is the fact that the characters will get stuck on stairs repeatedly. You may not notice until you're a good way off from them. Second is that whenever you go into the menu to turn the audio down or off, it will come on again once you go back to town or load a new level.\n\nEdit 2: More bugs and glitches found. Near the end of the game, a door becomes destroyed. Could not get one of the characters through. Also, the sound effects seem to randomly crap out and you're left with only music.\n\nRating: 2.5/5.0 - It's not awful, but it's not great.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","October 25, 2015","false","16.0"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","15","23","2","11"

Skills/abilities are limited to two per class plus an additional based off items. Tangrin based in the Netherlands is essentially a two-man operation. These creators definitely show their love for RPG's and game development but lacked the necessary broad stroke. Kyn suffers in a few areas. That isn't to say it's a bad game. It just could've been more.\n\nThe Good:\nVisuals mixed with an exciting soundtrack.\nInventive re-working of a tactical combat system.\nLevel design and interactive puzzles.\nChallenging gameplay experience.\n\nThe Bad:\nCamera controls that feel lacking.\nUI which feels generic.\nSkills/Abilities which are not expansive.\nUnderdeveloped NPC interactions.\n\nThe Ugly:\nStoryline, with the dialogue. It's extremely bland and is underwritten.\nExtremely underwhelming animations.\nAI tracking system for mobs.\nCharacter customization and item customization.\n\nOverall, Kyn is a decent ARPG. You'll have fun with it, if you're into the genre. The character customization could have been better. Yes, you can craft and ingredients drop from everything but it just had a bland approach. The three skill tree have 80 or so skills all together. Certain skills are more powerful than others and it really didn't feel balanced nor synergized. I will give it a recommendation if you're looking for a tactical ARPG. There are much better options for the $19.99 price tag on the market.

I would do the same, except i enjoyed those games.\n\nThis game is brutally repetitive. There are no tactics since you cant effectively pause the game. The slow motion is less than useful, you have time to assess the situation and issue one or two commands if you're lucky. This goes down if you're actually in a large battle with 6 party members and 15 monsters. The most effective "tactic" ive found is to just bumrush one monster after another and burn them down sequentially with autoattacks...no abilities, nothing else.\n\nThe abilities are very poor compared to your characters auto attacks once you get them decent weaponry. Those are the ones you get to choose when to use. The "feed" skills claim to pair 9 gems with abilities. There are only 1/3 of the combinations implied by t he game, as 3 gems work with each of the 3 skill trees, and there is no overlap. I.E. the life gem ONLY works on feed skills in the mind tree. With all this complicated nonsense of charging up an ability, the results should be pretty spectacular right? Nope, they feel just like another ability (underwhelming at best); one that you cant count on in a pinch. As a result i ended up ignoring the feed skills entirely.\n\nMissions are ok i suppose. I didnt finish the game TBH. I stopped on account of my blood pressure on the WORST escort mission of any game i've ever played. Getting 5 civilians through a gauntlet of rotating turrets that will 1shot them is unpleasant to say the least. Coupled with a very clunky reload system when you ♥♥♥♥ up, it makes it downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nGear is completely centered around crafting. Beyond the first mission you'll never equip anything you find. Its vendor trash to fuel buying components to craft your own gear. Chasing down random chests in the wilderness for component loot is fun at least, but I do wish the giant purple boss guy would drop something good enough that i'd consider wearing it.\n\nAll in all i cant say i recommend the game. Certainly not at list price. I paid 5 bucks, so i wasnt out too bad. Might be a title worth picking up on super sale, however.","November 9, 2015","false","16.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","1"

Not a huge thing, but an option to turn it on/off in the menu might be nice... which brings me to the rest of my review so far after having played a bit more\n\nNone of these things would prevent me from playing or recommending the game, however, they are things that I feel should be fixed in a patch.\n\n1. You cant change settings for the game except at the title screen menu. Again, this is 2015. Game options should be available at ANY time in the game. If something requires a restart, a prompt saying "Changes wont take effect until the game is restarted" is fine.\n\n2. There are many things in the game that your character has to stand directly on in order to interact with it. This is nearly impossible to do if you have all your characters selected, as none of them will move directly to where you click with the mouse. This is silly since even when all your characters are selected, there is still ONE main character highlighted. That character should always move to where you click, which would eliminate this issue\n\n3. There are numerous times, often after telling your character to use a skill, that they will just stop all combat. This seemed to happen more often with a character using a ranged weapon. Select the character, click the skill to use, and then that character will just stand there. Kind of frustrating, especially when playing on harder modes where every attack and second counts.\n\n4. Your first quest reward is a bow that is identical to the bow (in stats) you already have. Loot, at least in the first part of the game, is just as underwhelming and unexciting as this too.\n\n5. Im sure this has been mentioned, but the camera feels like it should rotate... I know it doesnt, but it just feels like it should. There are plenty of times when things obscure your characters from view (despite some objects fading out) that make viewing the game kind of a pain.\n\n6. While I enjoy the hidden areas with treasure that you have to find, there are a LOT more areas that look like you should be able to walk to, but cant. This shoves the "invisible wall" aspect in your face a bit more than Id prefer.\n\n7. The game has no tutorial... at all. Not a huge deal for an experience rpg player or gamer, but it could be a big turn off for people new to the genre. Especially given the games somewhat more in depth and complex systems (such as the feedstones).\n\n\nAgain, these issues dont make me want to stop playing, however, I feel its only fair to make them known to those who might be interested in the game. All of these things can be improved upon by the devs too. Time will tell. Aside from that, the game is very unique and kinda charming in its own way. Its in depth enough to keep me mentally engaged but also light weight enough to not make me feel like I have to invest tons of time into it in order to play through it.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nBig Update: (July 30 2015)\n\nThe devs have been extremely responsive and quick to acknowledge the things I listed. They have managed to patch the game enabling both Vsync and Mouse Lock in just a couple days time.\n\nThat is pretty freaking awesome.\n\nIn my limited time, ive jumped in to test out these technical improvements and am quite happy with them. The vsync works great (also helping keep the GPU temps at a more reasonable level), and the mouse lock works as expected. Big thumbs up to the developers.\n\nI can no longer suggest not getting this game for any technical reasons. It runs great, looks great, and has some hard working devs supporting it. Havent spent enough time yet to say if the actual gameplay/story line is well done yet, but from the 30 min or so ive played, im enjoying it and it seems like a solid game so far.\n\nStill hoping they add a few more graphical options to control some of the more advanced rendering features though, but this in no way keeps me from playing or from suggesting that you dont get the game.\n\nWish more game devs were like this, and I dont regret supporting their game after they have shown how dedicated they are not just to the game, but to the people who bought it.\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n(old review - pre patch)\n\nCant recommend this game in its current technical state. Just my personal gripes when developers do these sort of things. Its 2015, its not something we should see in games.\n\n1. The video settings are very limited. You dont have control over anything more than resolution, Bloom and if SSAO and AA are on/off. The games default AA is AWFUL. Not only does it not really work, its blurs the visuals BADLY.\n\n2. The game is missing a vsync options, and doesnt vsync even with it forced to on in the nvidia driver settings. I bring this up because firstly, I HATE screen tearing and feel 60 FPS is more than enough for a game to run at, and Secondly, when vsync isnt on, the game runs at a much much higher framerate, causing the GPU to run at 100%. No reason for this. AND it puts wear and tear on my GPU that I could care less for. No, my card isnt going to melt, but if witcher 3 runs at 65C, this game (which is visually less stunning), shouldnt be running at 80C. This is my personal upkeep preference, I know many others are like, "Your card is FINE at 90C, its meant to run hot, dont worry about it". Yay for you, I still want a VSYNC option.\n\n3. The game uses the mouse (screen panning) to move the view around. In full screen, the mouse isnt locked to the screen, so if you have more than 1 monitor, you will find your mouse pointer constantly moving to the second screen when attempting to pan around. Very frustrating.\n\n4. The games dialog (typed) progresses forward rather than you getting an option to read it and click continue. No, its not super fast, but its easy to miss something if you happen to be doing anything other than focusing on the game. Id love for there to be an option like nearly ALL games in the past that used typed dialog, to simply "click to continue" to the next bit of text.\n\nThe first 3 things are all things that annoy me enough to not want to play the game in its current state, and thus, I cant recommend this game. If you dont have issues with them, then take what Ive said with a grain of salt. Once and IF the devs address these short commings, ill revise this review.","July 29, 2015","true","1.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","22"

Scroll down to pluses and negatives.\n\nVisually Kyn resembles Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons (though less polished), which I'm going to admit I find very pleasing. The music sounds at times like it could have come straight out of Torchlight 2, generally it has a fitting Celtic vibe. The atmosphere of the game is, therefore, highly satisfying.\n\nGameplay-wise, this puts me in mind of an MMO more than a typical hack&slash. You hit space to slow the game to a crawl, issue commands to your fighters, then hit space again to see the commands executed in real time. You don't need to keep clicking to attack. You cannot pause for long, which gives the game a more intense feel than others with a Real-Time pausable combat system.\n\nThere are no classes in the game, though quickly you learn that you'll need to specialise your fighters to get the most out of them (I immediately modified my starting heroes so that one was a ranged healer and a melee fighter). But specialisation is somewhat simple: just pump all your stats into 'Body' for a fighter; 'Control' for an archer; 'Mind' for a mage or healer. This lacks the depth of a Diablo 2, or a PoE.\n\nThe game plays as a series of small challenges. You traverse areas fighting mini-combat challenges and solving puzzles. These often involve splitting up your fighters and stepping on switches and are a nice diversion from thwacking goblins and skeletons. The combat, however, is too easy on Normal difficulty and only really becomes a pleasurable challenge on Hard upwards. You literally have to micromanage every action your heroes take to keep them alive - especially when the suicide-bomber skeletons appear. This is why it feels like a series of combat challenges. Enemy types can become repetitive, however, and some are downright irritating (Hydra, I'm talking about you).\n\nUnfortunately the enemies quickly become repetitive. Literally, you fight the same four enemy types throughout. Worst of all, they are imbalanced in diffiulty. You start on Mission 1 fighting skeletons. When they reappear in Mission 15, they are as easy to defeat as they were in Mission 1 - its like they haven't leveled up with your characters.\n\nThe game revolves around a central hub 'village' in which you are given missions. You then hit a 'Start Mission' button to get transported to a mission map. Kyn isn't open world and you backtravel backtravel through previous areas. This create problems later when you need increasing amounts of money and loot to upgrade your equipment - and cannot afford it. You basically need to grind, but cannot: you cannot revisit old areas and enemies do not respawn. As a result you need to make a decision: upgrade some equipment, or upgrade all for only some of your team. Shame.\n\nLoot is a real problem. You don't get better loot on quests and from enemy drops than you can make or buy. To get loot you sometimes have to perform interesting (but lengthy puzzles). The most egregious of which is one where you have to rescue a creature from a cage. To do so you have to undertake a time-consuming puzzle involving a series of mine carts. Takes ages. Reward: I got a shield that I immediately sold as it was so much worse than the others I had equipped - or had access to.\n\nThe plot is workmanlike. The biggest problem is in team composition. You start with two guys. By the end you have 6. But you have no choice in who you fight with. There are a few NPCs you spend time getting to know (including one, Keira, who you do a load of quests for) but they don't join you. Instead you are joined by a bunch of heroes you don't care for, and cannot substitute them for those you do. A shame and I hope they allow Keira to join you (this would also re-balance the total lack of women in the game). On this note, there is a disturbing amoung of misogynistic language from some of the heroes towards the end of the game (the enemies are continually referred to as '♥♥♥♥♥es' and 'she-♥♥♥♥♥es', for instance).\n\nMy main criticism (and probably why some websites seem to think this is still in Early Access) is that the interface is unpolished. To save your game you have to hit escape (opens menu); then select the file you want to save to; hit 'Overwrite' and then 'Cancel'. There's no prompt to say 'Save Successful' and no visual indication you have saved the game. Most frustrating are the shops. Whatever you sell shows up in the display of any shopkeeper, implying they share an inventory. Yet if I go to the Blacksmith to craft an item, he won't have any of the crafting materials. You have to constantly trudge between Blacksmith and Vendor to craft items, with increasingly lengthy shopping lists. (I had to start making actual shopping lists on a pad of paper, you need to buy that much loot).\n\n+ Nice visuals\n+ Nice soundtrack\n+ Interesting gameworld\n+ Puzzle solving\n+ Occasionally Complex combat mechanicsc\n- User interface could do with some tweaks\n- Repetitive enemy types\n- Unrewarding loot\n- Broken vending and crafting mechanics\n- Normal difficulty and below are too easy\n- Disturbing lack of female characters and misogynistic dialogue in the later stages.\n\nI won't bother completing it, life is too short. But I will revisit in a few months and I hope that the devs (who are still working on the game) have fixed the vending mechanics, difficulty, added more playable characters and sorted out the lack of enemy variety.","August 5, 2015","false","16.4"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","2"

I wanted it to be good.\n\nThe best measuring stick against an isometric dungeon crawler like this is classic Dungeon Siege (2002).  However, I'm sorry to have to say that Dunegon Siege, while being thirteen years old at this point, is still by far the better experience.\n\nRather than go into a lengthy pseudo-professional game review, I'll just gloss over the worst points of this game:\nThe narrative is pretty messy.  What little narrative there is, anyway.  Admittedly, one does not enter into a game such as Kyn or Dungeon Siege looking for fantastic narrative.  But what Kyn offers is just terrible.\nThe GUI is very un-intuitive and sloppy.  Plenty of functions or features are not visible on the base screen by default.  By this I mean that you cannot, for example, order your caster to heal while also ordering your front-liner to use his wave attack, because the caster's skills only show up on your screen while you are micro-managing him, which you can't do while you are micro-managing your front-liner.  And you can't pause the game to go back and forth between characters to issue commands (see below).\nOn the whole, the game is poorly optimized and doens't flow smoothly.  It feels like a small dev team built it in somebody's basement.  The menus and in-game prompts aren't very obvious or smooth, as one should rightfully expect.\nBasic functions such as Party Formation, Party UI, Party AI, and Pause Game are entirely overlooked.  If any of these functions exist in the game, they were not easy to find and/or use.  After nearly every battle, my party members were scattered around, and short of me manually putting them into formation, they would remain in their scattered state as I ordered them to move on.  This made it very difficult to proceed through tight areas or to be ready for the next encounter.\nWhereas in Dungeon Siege you could pause the game with Spacebar, in Kyn you are restricted to 'slowing down time' for a short duration.  A blue meter ticks down rapidly while the monsters continue to bear down on your dying front-liner.  This 'feature' feels like a failed gimmick meant to replace the Pause Game feature with something with more flavor.  It doens't.\nThe graphics are poor, overall.  Granted, with most isometric RPGs you don't expect much when you look closely.  But with Kyn, you are constantly being bombarded with very dated and ugly rendering.\nIf you are looking for an isomentric, dungeon-crawling RPG, just get Dungeon Siege.  You can get it on Steam by purchasing the Dungeon Siege III package, which comes with a free copy of DS I and II.","November 6, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArtesQue/recommended/314560/","ArtesQue","ArtesQ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArtesQue/","95 products in account","What attracted me about this game is that the screenshots looked really good. Without even consulting the "About" I made the decision to buy this game.\n\nAt first glance the game seems well designed with nice art and fairly descent sized maps. Starting the game and getting used to the controls needs some practice. So be certain to look through all the controls before you starting playing.\n\nYou start of with two characters which both can control together or seperatly, which is tottaly new to me. Atleast in this kind of game. So this can be of a struggle from time to time.\n\nEnvironment:\nWhat i've encountered so far the world looks good and well designed but if you look more closely you find some minor flaws ( yes i'm getting very nitpicky here), the ground clutter could use some more variation, at some places in the world you will find areas where the ground clutter is practilly the same all over. At some times this seems very unnatural.\n\nSecond, the finishing of some objects for instance, rock staircases, instead of putting edges on them they covered it with rocks and boulders which is a shame, cause the textures of the game seem really good, I rather would've seen some more time spend into designing such stuff.\n\nFurther more it seems pretty well designed and even though they've used low poly trees, they made it work really well. And if you don't look the the enviroment to well you wont even notice the points noted above.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nYou start of with two character you can both control at the same time or individually. Which may need some practice but  you'll get the hang of it after a while. You control what to make of your characters, either make them a healer, archer or warrior. In the begging you can choose between 9 spells ( 3 for healer, 3 for archer and 3 for warrior). You can pick what kind of spells your character can use. With leveling up you can also choose how to strengthen you character, do you want your character to have more health and attack, choose body, and etc. Points awarded for each skill like body can be reassigned again if you want to, for example, your character to be an archer. You hold the power to do so.  While traveling through the land of Kyn, you will find many enemies to 'hack and slash'. Colors above their body suggests how strong they are. For example grey = weak, red is bit stronger and so on. Whilst roaming you will find UPC who will need help. Here you find your quests, this ofcourse can be various takst to complete. For finishing quest you will be awared loot or gold. Also, before I forget to mention it, mobs will also drop loot. The stronger the mob, the better the loot.\n\nThroughout playing the game you will find puzzles you will have to complete with the help of both characters. Sometimes you have to control your characters seperatly to finish this puzzle and get further into the storyline of the game. Puzzles are well designed and thought. It may need some practice and brain cramps but you'll get there eventually. Some puzzles are ofcourse harder then other, but still understandable for everyone.\n\nLoot:\nI probably won't have to tell you this. But i'm still going to do so. Loot can come in many form and shapes. Loot can be gold, crafting items, armor and weapons. Weapons and Armour will get better the further you will get into the game. The game uses colour codes for the item. Grey items being the 'weakest' for instance purple are 'stronger' and get extra bonuses such as, +8 damage. This is the same for crafting items, the further you get in the game, the better the items become. And ofcourse you can craft better items with those.\n\n\nCrafting:\nHavent tried it yet -- so further information will be here soon.\n\nBut still the basics, the better crafting items you have, the stronger of items you can craft.\n\n\nControls:\nIn my opinion this could've been designed better. Although you can costumise your own control to make it work a little bit better. With 'A', 'W' and 'E' you control the basic spells of each character. You can switch between them by using the 1 and 2 keys. Haggling between them to keep both character is a little getting used to in the beginning, but you'll get used to it. Or just use 'Tab' to switch between characters. The struggle sometimes is, espescially during a larger fight knowing when you're in control of both characters or not. It's best to know before hand how to properly control both character else you will make it harder for yourself. Where in most games this is second nature, it isnt here.\n\nMoving your characters is doing by clicking the right mouse button, instead of holding it and let the characters move to the point of where your mouse is,  you have to click again and again to get your characters where you want. But this can be a personal preference. Up to you to decide which is nicer.\n\nMovement of character, whether your character of 10 pixels appart of 100 pixels appart. Whern you move both characters at the same time, the distance between them will be kept the same. Which unintentially can cause, that the character you dont want to be in front, will be in the front of the fight. So switching between characters all the time can be a bit frustrating. But maybe is just because im tottaly not used to it, it is new for me.\n\nTo add to the part of clicking and hold to move, when youre in town apperently this function excist by using your left mouse button, but when youre out in the field. The function doesn't seem to excist. Bit weird?, but oke.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the game seems really well made and thought of , world can be designed a little bit better ( but this not of a big deal at all). The fighting against mobs seems good, occassionally your character can get stuck between them. But as long you can control your characters well it doesnt seem to be a haggle. The game could need some little bit of polishing but the base seems really firm. Defently worth a try.\n\n\nPS.\n\nForgot about talking about the "Slow Time" button which can be used in fight to help you assist in placing your characters in the fight. Which can come in very usefull if your character are in low health and you need some quick healing to be done.","November 10, 2015","true","1.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I've seen it compared to Dungeon Siege 1 and 2 and to say it's their successor but it isn't even close.  I'm on mission 4 and you only have 2 Characters that are customizable at that stage and not a complete party.  You get Random guys to join you on certain missions but they just leave at the end of the mission.\nSome of the problems with this game is you mostly only get crafting materials from Treasure Chests instead of Items so you have to buy all of your equipment.  Number 2 the characters you have already have their own names you can't name your characters and "create" your own party.  Also Characters are not very customizable at all.  The only stats they have\nare Control , Body and Mind and you put all of your points that you gain each level into those 3 stats.  There is not a long list of stats to put your ability points into.  There is only overland adventure also, no dungeons, nothing underground to explore, you can't enter into any buildings, open doors , etc.  All of the loot seems to be in treasure chests and you just bash them open.  No lockpicking ability nothing.  Also the game is very very linear.  All of the maps have very narrow corridors that you explore so you can't just explore everywhere on the map to see what is out there.  You can only explore in the very narrow window of the map.  Also talking to villagers is generally worthless.  You can click on talk to them over and over again and they will say the same thing over and over again and most of them just say the same thing the other villagers do.  In Divinity you can get quests from all kinds of villagers not just ones with a question mark over them like this game.  And you can actually communicate with them.  In this one all of the guards and general villagers are generic and don't really do anything for the "Role Playing" aspect of the game.  I totally disagree with the other review that says these are comparable to Dungeon Siege 1 and 2.  They are not at all.  Those are really good games.  I do agree with him that Dungeon Siege 3 is a joke because they totally ruined that game.  Interacting with most villagers in this game changes nothing in the game and you learn very little information as they are so generic.  If the bug I've encountered in Greenport gets fixed then I may finish this game as I have nothing better to do right now but it's not a very good game.  Pick up one of the newer titles if you want a good Role Playing game like Pillars of Eternity, Divinity Original Sin, Lords of Xulima (Which I didn't think was that great at first but it grew on me) or go old school and get Dungeon Siege 1 and 2 or really old school and find a computer that can still play the original Gold Box Series of Dungeon and Dragons Role Playing games.  I would pass on Kyn though.\n","December 16, 2015","false","11.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Okay. More than $5? No.\n\nThis is a negative review. Positive comments at the end. Again, if it's $5, good game.\n\nClunky UI that requries lots of micro, it's sort of like trying to play a starcraft mission when your only units are a science vessel, a high templar, dark archon, a ghost and a queen. Oh, wait, no, it takes a little more micro than that would since the melee units don't automatically pursue targets. Maybe some people would think that's great, I find keyboard mouse controls really un-ergonomic these days. I'm going to grow my party to have more ranged attackers just so they take less micro. I don't care about how fast I can or can't do it, how hard the micro makes the game or not, there's a slow down button that's effectively as good as pause, I just really don't want to do all that clicking and keying, winning or losing not withstanding.\n\nManaging gear and crafting is also a total visual mess that I can't bring myself to look at long enough to understand. I've played more than too many games where I have to compare this adjective-gear-of-noun to that noun's-gear-of-present-continuing-tense-verb. I'll just sell stuff en masse, buy the best stuff I can see, and hope for the best.\n\nUltra boring cliche fantasy setting, art, music. The graphics are good; the art and theme are just really unoriginal. Again, it's a personal preference, some people will want what this is, I'd rather have anime, or sci fi, steam punk, post-apoc, anything but "blah fantasy". How's this setting even relevant to my life? To the human condition? There isn't even any voice acting to explain the game to me! I'm too lazy to read this garbage! (note that I would hate on the voice acting if it were there, too)\n\nBut, I put it on super-easy difficulty, where I don't have to use the UI effectively, I don't have to worry about maximizing fantasy equipment that I don't care about, I don't have to worry about endlessly wandering the terrain in a clunky UI to find all the loot that would probably be important if it were harder, and I convince myself to ignore the awful cliche thematics, and it's been a fine use of this morning. I recommend it at $5.","December 17, 2015","true","8.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

On one hand I have been waiting impatiently for its release for a few months, because a Viking-themed RPG with puzzles sounded like something that would be right up my alley, and besides it looked really good. However, I was under the impression that I would be able to customise my characters (looks, names etc. and not just skills), so I was disappointed to find that the player-characters are pre-made. To top it off, not only are both the two starting characters dudes, but they are especially bland dudes too. Even if I never say no to a well-written dudette, this would not have been an issue if the rest of the game was good. However, after about 40 minutes of playtime I found the story-telling to be ranging between ‘clumsy’ and ‘okay’, and the game-mechanics to be merely ‘okay’. I realise that maybe this gets better further into the game, but because of the character-issue I just do not feel invested enough to keep going. I had high hopes for this game and I still think that it looks great and sounds even better, so my “Not Recommended” is somewhat tentative. If you do not think the issues I have described sound like something that would bother you, you might like it.","August 5, 2015","false","0.7"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

Has to be done at town blacksmith between missions and while the gear is good it is basically buying good gear with money + materials. Doesn’t feel like real crafting because it doesn’t have much depth to it\nMovement can be a little janky at times; especially after looting a chest\nGraphics:\n\nGame looks really good, nothing that would blow your socks off but for an indie dev it’s solid\nCharacters are hard to see up close in action but they all have unique looks and each weapon and armor has it’s own assets\nAble to change character’s two main color schemes anytime\nSound:\n\nFX: Battles sounds and other SFX all sound great\nMusic:  By Will Bedford (UK) is good; in the first mission I found the BGM to be too “Lord of the Ringsish” and it got on my nerves a bit but other tracks are quite nice\nVoice Acting: This game could have used real voice acting, at least for the main characters.  It is really done a disservice without it.\nStory:\n\nSet in a “magical viking world” but is pretty light on story content.\nTrailer for the game made it seem like a light hearted buddy adventure; but without any voice acting and sometimes too-quick back-and-forth dialog that pops up when you are running around in a mission it’s hard to get a feel for the characters\nThat said if you really read the dialog and pay attention there is some story to be found here\nLevels/Maps:\n\nMaps are just non-linear enough to be fun to explore and find out of the way chests\nHowever some maps felt like the map was designed first and then if some parts weren’t needed for the story/quests they just threw a treasure chest there as filler (or worse, they didn’t and it was a dead end)\nFinal Verdict:\n\nKyn offers a lot of gameplay at a low price and is a very solid title for a new indie release.  While a majority of the game is middle-of-the-road tried-and-true it is pretty fun and combat can be a surprising challenge even at normal difficulty!  All in all I am looking forward to playing this game more even with it’s short comings and I would say its a safe title to buy.\nDisclaimer; while I was provided a copy of this game for review purposed I was not compensated for my thoughts, ideas and opinions those are all my own.\n","July 28, 2015","true","2.9"," 87 of 191 people (46%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","46","87","191","7","0"

The games combat takes place in real time however has the ability for you to slow down time for a more tactical view of the battle, allowing you to issue order to each character then resume normal time. The bled of tactical combat with more fast paced action combat works really well, it allows you to plow through a group of weaker enemies fast but then take the time required to deal with tougher foes.\n\nThere is a good enemy variety in the game and most will require tactics to take down. Enemies like units that have shields cannot be attacked from the front so it’s often best to have a character attack from the front while the other go round the back to do the damage. There are some huge enemies will some devastating attacks not to mention the hordes of smaller foes you’ll be up against. The enemy variety keeps the game fresh and group battles can become extremely tense not to mention chaotic. In fact when you’re facing a large amount of enemies that when you really begin to appreciate the slow time ability to give you a chance to issue orders and position your party for maximum effectiveness. Overall the combat is fun and works well, it has it’s downsides in that in can be clumsy but for the most part it keeps you going by providing some good challenge.\n\nThe story of the game is ok, its nothing particularly memorable but it serves it purpose. The most disappointing thing about the game for me was the writing. It was poor at best, characters all spoke like children and while the occasional joke was funny, the majority of the text was cringe worthy. It cannot be overstated how bad the games dialogue is. The major issue with the poor dialogue is that with the games chosen art style particularly for the characters being somewhat cute cartoonish, it makes the game come across as somewhat childish in a bad way almost as if the dialogue was written by a 13 year old English student.\n\nOverall if you like action RPG's with a tactical element thrown in then KYN is a good choice. It's a pretty good indie game that is let down by its story and writing but makes up in its combat and visuals.\n\n\n","July 28, 2015","true","13.6"," 26 of 88 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","26","88","2","0"

Each of which you can equip with their own weapons and armors. You also can assign 2 skills from the skill tree to each character. This brings me to the first part of the game that I found different and kind of nice which is the skill tree which is used to provide skills to your whole party.\nThe skill tree has 3 different sets of skills: Mind, Body, and Control. Each of these consist of 18 skills unlocked in sets of 3 every 15 levels and 3 Feed skills per category. The Feed skills are also different, thing of them as skills that you can gem like an item. Each feed skill can be changed a bit depending on which Feed Stone you assign to the skill, there are 10 different Feed Stones, although each Feed skill only works with certain stones.\n\nThere is crafting as well, which I would say is unique to an RPG of this style, but over the years it's become more commonplace. There is quite a bit you can craft, though I'm uncertain if these items are more powerful than found items just yet.\n\nKyn also uses a slow time mechanic instead of pausing the game. This allows you a bit of time to select each individual party member to assign targets in combat or cast spells. It's a nice way to keep pace of combat without coming to a screeching halt.\n\nI've run into a couple puzzles so far in the form of pressure plates. In which I had to use one character to step on one switch to open a gate, then take my other party member to the next switch to unlock another switch to open a switch under that switch next to a tree, then get the first party member to leave his switch, trapping the second party member, to go stand on another switch to trigger a stone walkway. I got 99 problems and a switch ain't one.\n\nThis may be a bit exaggerated but you get the point, I like these puzzles though. They take time to solve but are fairly simple. I'm hoping as the game progresses to see different kinds of puzzles.\n\nA few gripes I've had are minor and nothing I can't deal with. The mouse cursor not being restrained to the window in fullscreen mode, dialogue auto scrolls a bit too fast, and the inability to change game settings once in a game (you have to back out to the main menu).\n\nOverall, I think Kyn is a great indie RPG with some very fun and original ideas.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NfKXE7eINzs\n\nEarlyAccessMedia.com","July 28, 2015","true","3.1"," 13 of 68 people (19%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","19","13","68","3","0"

I do not like the way the camera jumps from character to character and there doesn't seem to be a way to reset that. It's not really like an ARPG as much as a quick baldur's gate style fight. My not recommended has to do with the fact that nothing pulled me into the game, I didn't care for the comic-like graphics, and the way the screen jumps when you select different characters.","December 5, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
