I don't play a lot of point-and-click adventure game, but this game is not too bad compare to some of same genre games that I have played. Funny story, decent graphic, smooth gameplay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxyshadis/recommended/12340/","foxyshadis","foxyshadis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxyshadis/","1720 products in account","A sprawling, humorous adventure in the old style, beset by enough problems that it's better to save yourself from the frustration and forget about it. Lots of pretty decent voice acting, even if it's all hammy and silly, but few of the belly laughs of the Monkey Island games they tried to emulate, only with too much heavy sarcasm and not enough absurdity. The graphics are bright and shiny, the characters even occasionally have a bit of real-life spark to them, and there are a hell of a lot of puzzles to solve (plus a few fetch quests). When the occasional hilarious moments clicked, it almost made it all worth it.\n\nMy biggest problem with it was the utterly plodding pace everyone shuffled at, and with such a huge world, you could catch a nap walking between areas. With zero in-game tutorial, there was no way to know that a double-click made you run, until a puzzle near the end through was unsolvable if you didn't, so I had to go online and find out that the game screwed me. Combine that with terrible pathing, where you take the longest route and walk in circles to get to anything, and it was a dull, frustrating game. The horrible camera contributes significantly; they tried to make it as cinematic as possible with fixed cameras that turn with you, but half the time that just means you have to click every two seconds to keep walking. Some of the swooping effects are nice, but interfere with gameplay whenever you want to click on something while you're walking. The cinematic experience was kind of broken anyway, when everyone looks off into space while talking to each other and  uses the exact same hand gesture.\n\nCompared to that constant irritation, the occasional insane puzzle (or insane chapter, as Amanda's seemed to be), and the expected heaping bugs that every adventure game has weren't as bad. They just meant I ended up leaning on a walkthrough at times to figure out what one thing I'd missed somewhere, and occasionally rage quitting for a few days when it crashed again.\n\nI think I truly came to hate it when I found a good fix, and Jack said, "No, that would be the obvious solution. I feel like some challenge. Let's try it another way...."\n\nUltimately, I grimly finished it just because I'd already invested so much time, but it became an endurance that I wouldn't wish on anyone. A little polish would have taken the game into the timeless classic realm, but instead it ended up average and forgettable.","August 10, 2014","false","22.0"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","25","34","0","0"

I initially purchased it because it was on sale and I had a lot of free time. The controls were kind of dodgy and the puzzles were challenging enough ( I remember having to look up a decent amount of them). The humor reminded me somewhat of a knock off of Monkey Island. It has some replayability for some hidden items, but once you found them there's no real reason as the story is kind of unoriginal for  If you're a fan of classic Point and Click adventures I would give it a try, but wait until it is on sale.","April 17, 2014","true","17.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

This game is practically the same as Ankh 3. There would be nothing wrong with that, IF Ankh 3 would not be exacty the same as Ankh 2 and Ankh 2 was any different from Ankh. This is just not funny anymore. To make long story short, buy this game only if You hadn't played anything else from Deck 13. You can enjoy like 5 hours of this humor. If You played all the Ankh games, you are likely to have spent 50 hours with Deck 13 and that is just too much.\n\nGraphics is terrible, there are MANY small bugs (especially comments of some objects that are obviously wrong, some labels are missing completely being replaced with some development debug macros and so on). The camera is horrible, in the menu I cannot see any cursor so it always takes quite a time before I guess it's position and highlight the option I want, and having multiple monitors adds some more problems like the cursor won't stop at the edge of the main screen and often you click out of the game's window making it minimized (from the technical perspective this is the worst game I have ever played) It also takes a really long time to go back to the game after this happens. And the worst of all: All the puzzles, if you can call it like that, are absolutely ilogical and just stupid and the obvious solutions to the situatation just do not work with no indication of explanation or whatever. Well you can call that funny only if it is your first game from Deck 13. The game is also pretty childish (you can't even hit a monkey, that the developers made sure you will learn to hate a great deal throughout the game, while it is tearing your airplane apart during the flight and you need to figure out a way to put it safely down while the very fate (of course) of the world is at stake). On the other hand there are quite a lot of erotic undertone and ambiguity - so you can't really tell which group do the developers really try to target.\n\nBUT even then I was somehow able to play the game till the end (although with some swearing and curses) and I must confess I kinda liked it so it was not all that bad. As I have already mentioned several times: I think You will like it depending on how many of Deck 13 game you have already played.","May 11, 2014","false","15.9"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","2"

Jack Keane has decent graphics, controls reasonably well, and even made me chuckle once or twice. Why do I not recommend it then?\n\nThe puzzles are badly designed and I can not count the amount of times I found myself saying, "What am I supposed to do?" No, not wondering how to solve a puzzle. I found myself wondering what I should even be trying to solve. The problem is that the game does not clearly establish what the puzzles are. Jack rarely offers even the remotest clue about what he thinks of a puzzle and it is extremely easy to miss a key item just because you ran past it.\n\nI adore adventure games and love great puzzles, but this game was a misfire.

Actually, it's kinda hard not to think of Monkey Island while playing it, except that while one is based on the Caribbean, this one happens around India (Company of Merchants of London Trading to the East Indies, anyone?). Unlike other traditional adventures titles, this one actually allows the player to solve some puzzles through the use of different means, managing to break at least a lil' bit of the linearity. The screen orientation moves with the character and that's quite annoying, it takes a while to get used to it (I've finished the game and I'm still not used to it, for the record).

When I finished it, I saw in the lines the names OGRE, cegui, opcode, and FMOD. Well I searched them a little bit and I was right from what I saw in game... a low budget game(German Studio). But the team has done great efforts to make this game as more real as it can be. It is a game that its style and music will get your mind to Indiana Jones movies, but this time the game has to show English and Indian themes in a pirate style. The game has some adult jokes so to those who track the kids ages I wouldn't suggest an age below 15 years old.\n\nThe Story is good, still I was NOT amazed. It has much fun in it to keep you play it but not jokes they will drop you from your chair.It has a love story, especially after the middle point of the game that the difficulty increases a litle bit. The hardcore adventurer has nothing to fear. Even a normal person will not be frustrated by the game. It is an one-way adventure and the most times the riddles are obvious.\n\nThe game is in FULL 3D graphics and the camera changes to the point you walk. Every video or action you make, even when you speak to another character the game goes in cinematic mode. If you activate "Historical Mode" under the Bonus material then all the game color changes under the classic OLD movie filter. It's relaxing and lovely for a while but I still prefer normal color. You'll see many good scenes. As the 3D graphics progressed through little time I wouldn't say you'll be amazed. But the quality is good. I liked much the water sceneries. I have some screenshots in my library.\n\nAs much for the sound is OK. As I played the game in English, I really liked the Classic English accent of agent Motgomery and the voices of Jack and Amanda. I also liked Mr Gopesh that represented the Mafia and of course the pharmacist. The music is good and matches the game standards.\n\nAs you go on the game you may find some BONUS objects that unlock the main  characters of the game under the Waxed Museum in Bonus features.\n\nSo, I would say... A GREAT low budget 3D Adventure but not much for a Hardcore Adventurer.\n","October 17, 2015","true","21.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some antivirus programs may (hopefully falsely) recognize the exe file as infected and can block/remove the file from your computer so that later steam will claim that the game file does not exist. All you will see is a black screen when you start the game. Make sure to tell your antivirus not to bother about the game file when you start the game first (when you get the black screen, press cntrl alt del, open the file manager, and when the antivirus message comes up, tell it to leave the file alone, if there is such an option). After that the game runs fine. Also, in the community hub many people (especially with Win 7) complain about buying the game and then not being able to play it. Requirements say Vista or XP. I run it on Win 7 though, but took me some time to deal with the antivirus block.

A funny story, clever puzzels, enjoyable voice acting, and of absolute importance, speedy, although in a few certain areas, not always the easiest to control, walking movement.\nIt's a long game.\nDoesn't have a hint system.\nYou do get to see the main character's butt.\nSlightly annoying in the fact that you have to have the mouse on practically the exact right pixel to pick-up/use small items.\nBut only minor complaints. I really liked this game.\n\nBuy it cheap. Play it long. Love it hard!","November 2, 2015","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Such a shame, she was hot :)\n+ Sometimes cutscenes ending fast, cutting the dialoges but not a big problem.\n\nVERDICT: An adventure and a hot blonde chick waiting for you. Buy it on discounts...","April 27","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
