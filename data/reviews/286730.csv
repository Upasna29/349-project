Gunship! is NOT a new game. As a matter of fact, it's so old that most young gamers probably never heard of it. But, that's not as bad as it sounds, because Gunship! is a good game.\nIt's not perfect on all fronts, but the fact that you can play this in Co-Op is awesome. (Pilot/Gunner)\nYes, I know, the store page doesn't mention it, but it has multiplayer Co-Op support.\nIf you experience any problems with the multiplayer part you might want to start a single player game first. (You had to do that all the time, prior to hosting a session) That's what worked back then.","July 11, 2014","true","0.2"," 106 of 125 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","106","125","0","16"

If you do not own a joystick, get one. Or get stuck in the gunners seat giving directions to the pilot where to go. Store page really should get the key reference card from "Replacementdocs" (see forum) since there are plenty of them and keys are not bound to normal ones, i.e. i expected Map to be on M (Mike) not on N (november). I do not get the "Gunship feeling" from this game, its more a feeling of "Havoc" or "A10 tank buster", even if it says that Microprose published it. Unlike what IGN said, you can get realism in flight by changing flightmode to - realistic (Duuh).\n\nSo - should you buy it? Why not, chopper sims are not that common - and this is one of the better ones.","December 20, 2014","true","0.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I'd say it's pretty good if you are up to a challenge. This is seriously the hardest flight sim I ever played. I played with all settings on realistic, and then jumped into a quick randomly generated mission. I flew a bit, and before I could even lock onto an enemy, I got one shotted. I then tried again and again, but everytime a single hit kills you. The game aparently does have a very advanced damage model with all sorts of components that can be damaged, but I don't see a reason for that, since a single shot pretty much kills you. I then changed the damage model from realistic to resistant, but it only makes the heli withstand a few more hits than 1, and then bam, the heli is rekt. At least on resistant damage settings you get a chance to get notified on what got damaged without being immediately thrown into the death animation, but once you take a little more damage, you're going down. This game is the hardest game ever made. It is 50 times harder than both dark souls games and demon's souls games combined, plus the impossible game and geometry dash and why so evil 1 and 2 combined. If you like games that are almost literally impossible, you will love this game!\n11/10 It's still not hard enough! Hey, that's what she said!\n\nOk, now to be serious: This really is a great simulator, and it really is as hard as I said it is, so yeah, I really recommend it.","June 29, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Simply because I'm not able to play this game. Unlike others it does start for me. The problem i have is that i can't change the controls anywhere. I googled it but more games are being called gunship and it doesn't register the ! in the search.\nMaybe the game is great, i don't know. It won't work with my joystick a Thrustmaster Hotas. It only registers the throttle but the stick itself won't work. I wanted to change this, see if i could calibrate it or see if i could find the other controls on how to fly my helicopter. Appearantly you can't do this in the configuration and from what i understand that is some copy protection bullcrap. I can't find any pdf either in my steam folder with the keycontrols and even read that the publisher republished this game in a jewelcase without the keyboard layout in the PDF making it pretty much a guessing game how things work. This is very bad and there for i cannot recommend the game. You should at all times be able to adjust the controls, no matter what, period!","April 7, 2015","false","0.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"
