"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ifeellikeasir/recommended/201870/","ifeellikeasir","Like[A]SiR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ifeellikeasir/","1082 products in account","Disclaimer: I would like to thank the random kind stranger who has given me this game as a gift.\nPlot  – Similar to the previous one, this also requires you to play them for you to truly understand what has happened. Following the events from Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood , Desmond Miles, have entered a comatose state and the only way for you to get back in the real world is to relive the remaining gaps of his ancestor. And from this, it’s high recommended that you also play the first Assassin’s Creed as this will also tell the story of the Altair. So in short, there are three stories that can be found in this game. First, is about Desmond Miles and his time on the Animus Island where you are imprisoned while on comatose state. Second is Ezio Auditore, instead of picking up from where it ended on the previous game, time has pass by and he is now on his early 50’s. And lastly, is Altair’s story.\n\nEnvironment and Design  –  The game is set on Istanbul, definitely quite a turn from the previous games. The map is divided into two large areas, though this time it does seem a very large map due to not having any horse to help you get into places but also the underground tunnels are limited. It does take some time for you to get to one place to another because of this. The areas are completely improved and more realistic as there are more animations for the NPCs around you. The game also has a noticeable day and night cycle, and during somewhere midnight, the streets are almost empty. They also made a great job on creating the map; one of my favourite areas is the bazaar. It is an indoor market with open entrances.\n\nUnlike the previous games, starting off with this one does seem kind of new. The UI are redesigned so it took me a few minutes to get used to it. And there are couple of times that I had to restart the game due to the screen being stuck on a black screen or having bugs while loading. Also, starting the game without any sound can occur.\n\nGameplay  – A lot of features have been introduced in this game. Now instead of having the usual dual blades, now you get a hidden blade and a hook blade. Even though the hook blade is still used as a weapon during combat, it also offers a huge help on parkours. You can now climb a little higher with help of the extended reach from the hook, give you a huge leap on lanterns and giving more animations during the parkour. This blade can also pull down scaffoldings, damaging those who are nearby and even do flips towards an enemy. Speaking of enemies, the finishing moves also received some updates. Lots of animations have been added and you look more brutal on delivering those finishing moves.\n\nNext addition was the creation of bombs. Now at first I had some troubles on using them, in fact I didn’t start using them until I was one fourth of the main story. There are three categories for the bombs that you can create, first are the explosive bombs. This are the bombs made to damage and kill of those who are hit. Next are the tactical bombs, these are used to help you out during combat which gains you a huge advantage towards the enemies. And lastly, are the decoy bombs. This bomb can lure a group of soldiers away from an area to avoid any conflict.\n\nA feature removed from the previous game was the ability to lower your notoriety by ripping off wanted posters of yourself. Now the only way to get less suspicious is either bribing a herald or killing an officer in the area. And this is not so bad at all, in fact, when you’ve reached the highest notoriety possible there is a chance that the Templars may assault one of your dens. And to defend them, you will be playing a tower-defense like mini-game. And having  high notoriety, also has a chance that you also get hunted down by a mercenary, this leaves you to keep on your toes at most times.\n\nNow, coming back from Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood, recruiting assassins are also doable in this game. And in this game, they’ve added a depth on this feature. Some recruits have a backstory with them, requiring you to do a different ask instead of just helping him kill of the Templars who are harassing him. Not only this but there are stories around the brotherhood you are managing once you’ve trained an assassin to the max level.\n\nControls  – Please take note that the controls has received some changes, some keys are altered and some are assigned to a new one. Your weaponry is now divided into two, the main weapon and the secondary equipment. With this, you can combine different weapons and equipment to your liking.\n\nConclusion  – A game that started with a great story, also ended with an excellent one. If you have played the previous games, I don't see any reason for you not to get this.  And this really left me very satisfied; it really is a one hell of a ride for me.\n\nSince this game requires Uplay in order to be played, I suggest that you turn off the cloud synchronization as it may result your save file to be corrupted on accidental shutdowns.\nThank you for your time reading this review that I made. And I would highly appreciate it if you can rate it to your liking. Below are the links for my other reviews that would complete this story arc.\n\nAssassin's Creed II - Review\n\nAssassin's Creed: Brotherhood - Review","November 7, 2015","true","25.9"," 103 of 114 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","103","114","7","0"

Add in flashbacks to key moments in Altair's life and brief, optional excursions to Desmond's mind in the Animus and this plot is packed to the limit. The most compelling material by far involves Ezio, as his storyline is the most complicated. His quest to discover more information about Altair ties itself to the political and social turmoil in Constantinople. On a basic level, Revelations functions much like the Assassin's Creed games that came before. You're still accepting various missions that task you with chasing, stalking, meeting or killing certain targets. The curse of the franchise has always been that it seems to fill your time with missions that are completely irrelevant to the larger story. Ubisoft more or less avoids that trap this time, mostly because its plot has so many layers.Ubisoft made a number of additions to Revelations in terms of control, weaponry and gameplay. The most critical alteration is simply a button layout change. Players will now directly access a secondary weapon in addition to a primary one.Bombs serve as an extension of your more flexible combat options. Throughout Ezio's time in Constantinople, he'll acquire a wide range of ingredients that can be assembled into three different categories of bombs.Though missions and core combat mechanics remain very familiar, Ubisoft did add a new dynamic to the territorial control element of Revelations. Multiplayer is augmented again this time around, with various new modes, a wealth of customization options, a better interface and even a story mode that will allow players to learn more about the modern day Templars as they progress in the Abstergo facility. Revelations serves its lead characters well and is a very effective bookend. The improvements in graphics and storytelling, combined with already-great voice acting and music, help make this a memorable finale for some of the most interesting video game characters we've seen in this generation.","October 19, 2014","true","17.2"," 94 of 103 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","94","103","2","3"

I'm sorry I mean Assassin's Creed series (some of you will get that joke).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaphyBear/recommended/201870/","RaphyBear","♥BonBonBear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaphyBear/","122 products in account","Time to review what I consider to be one of the best ways to end an amazing trilogy off in a nice little bow.\n\nTo take into consideration:This game was bought by me during the Ubisoft Weekend Sale whereby I got this game for €8.99. ($10.13 in USD and £6.64 in British Pound Sterling) When I intially bought the game, it was the Gold Edition meaning that in this review I will include The Lost Archive, Mediterranean Travel Map Pack and The Ancestors Character Pack.\n\nStoryline condensed by me:You play as Ezio Auditore De Firenze, this time continuing off from where the story left off in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood whereby it is Ezio's time to travel to Constantinople. With the history of Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad to give Ezio a sense of direction as to what to do and what to discover, he sets off in order to finish off what Altaïr wanted discovered.\n\nPros:     The game has an amazing story that definitely finishes off what the trilogy and the first game wanted to finish off. The fact that you get to have a nice change of pace with switching between Ezio and Altaïr and finding out more about Altaïr's history and the remainder of his life as well as what would be continuing to Ezio's as well. The game's pacing was excellent in this game, in my opinion and the changes gave the game an advantage for me rather than a negative.\n\nThe gameplay sticks true to the others being as simple to pick up and play however with new added bonuses such as the Hookblade addition and bomb additions. As well as that, there were definitely bigger emphasis on history and story in this game. Collectables in this game didn't just serve a purpose as a collectable such as the feathers in the other games but you got collectables such as the Niccolò Polo books. I just wished we got more epic moments like Maiden Tower or Hagia Sophia dungeons because they were fun and memorable as hell.\n\nThey definitely refined the gameplay making a lot of features that were minor annoyances in the previous entries such as the collection of feathers and the incentive to find a map to collect them all for 100% is a bit more toned down. In this game, you collect Animus Data Fragments which could then be used to Desmond's story but when you do reach 50/100, you get a helping hand from the game whereby the locations of the other 40-50 are shown.\n\nWhat else can I say about the graphics but praise them? Heck, they're the same from every other Ezio Assassin's Creed game and this game pretty much does the same. But what I do love about the Ezio and even the first Assassin's Creed games is that if you have a usual not-so-buffed PC like I do, you'll be able to run this 50 frames-60 frames really well.\n\nBut this game still delivers having excellent notable moments in which you do have to just stop and observe or maybe take a photograph of how beautiful the visuals were handled. As well as that, the art style in the Lost Archive was quite unique and a pleasure to look at.\n\nAs well as that, the edition of more characters and not just characters but even more memorable characters gave the game some charm to me. I mean, who the heck can forget the darling Sofia or the stereotypical "branch of the family tries to take power of the main family," jerk Prince Ahmet?\n\nThe edition of more game modes such as the tower defense mini-game (which I honestly wished was implemented more to the game) and the Lost Archive and Desmond Journey missions which was a unique sandbox platforming first-person narrative on the lives and history of Desmond and Subject 16.\n\nThe exciting and fun multiplayer which will certainly keep you going after the main quest is over. It makes assassinating all the more rewarding when it's with other players with proper A.I. And the extra characters in the Ancestors Character Pack and the additional extensive maps tying into the main story of the Mediterranean Traveler Map Pack just give the game more valour and quite the experience.\n\nCons:     Money building in this game is unbalanced, in my opinion. Wanting to obtain 100% income in Constantinople could not have been any harder with the game giving you income in the bank every 20 MINUTES! As you can see by my gameplay time, I've exceeded the point in which I should've finished and 100% completed the game due to income griding because it takes sooo long and it's so tedious to get income quickly to pay for monuments. That's another issue I had with the game, the fact that monuments were so expensive and two 20 minute income grinds were what was necessary to upgrade the monuments. (even if everything else is upgraded)\n\nIn my opinion, the way to have reduced the time spent on getting income was to either 1. Lower down the time taken from 20 to maybe 10 minutes for income. 2. Lower the cost of monuments to perhaps 30,000 so that at least one income obtained at the bank can be enough to pay for one. Or 3. Have more things to do in the after-game besides the challenges for the factions. Which brings me to my next point..\n\nThere wasn't a lot to do after the main story was completed. If you were like me and you completed all the side content during the main story such as the "Desmond's Journey," sections, the bonus missions you're given like the Vlad the Impaler mission or even so much as to collect all the Ishak Pasha maps.. you found yourself being barely able to do anything post-game especially if it included grinding for gold. The only thing I found to do was the challenges themselves or the Assassin's Recruit and Job missions which were fun to initiate but for the most part way too long especially if you were not really doing anything. Although the Master Assassin missions were quite fun. ;3\n\nMultiplayer nowadays is unbalanced with new players being partnered up with level 50 players who are certainly veterans of the multiplayer and there was no sense of matchmaking involved. But then again, how can you blame it when not a lot of people are playing this game online? But due to the staggering amount of players who play online, you're crippled and feel like your money wasn't so much worth it for the extra characters and maps because everyone just plays the usual maps over and over again. This makes multiplayer all the more repetitive and honestly turned me off after the 15th time playing and constantly telling myself to give it a shot when it does become repetitive after a while.\n\nNot necessarily a con to be added onto the score but if you aren't a fan of long credits that run on for 16 minutes or so, make sure to find something to do when the credits come about because they aren't going to be as interactive as Assassin Creed 2's gameplay at the credits. x3\nIn conclusion:An excellent game which holds up and has become one of the top best Assassin's Creed games for me. In my opinion, although the gameplay can seem lackluster especially in the multiplayer, this is a game definitely worth playing in your life if you love games with an interesting story topped off with more history than the other editions that came before and character development. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I can't wait to review the other Assassin's Creed games and play the ones I haven't yet. I give Assassin's Creed Revelations a 9/10 and a recommendation to buy it but only with the intent of perhaps buying The Lost Archive and the full game if you think you won't be as invested into the multiplayer as I have.\n\nThank you so much for reading my review, please give me feedback if any and happy gaming.\n\n~ Raphy <3 c:","May 7, 2015","true","63.5"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","27","30","2","0"

Fear not, instead of seeking out medical attention, or generally waiting for Desmond to wake up as going into a coma is a serious side effect of the Animus.. his trusty companions decide the best course of action is to strap Desmond into the Animus for yet another fun and exciting adventure as Enzio..  Immediately you'll notice something Enzio is a geriatric now.  He's old, he looks to have aged about 40 years since Brotherhood, but we'll let that slide because in all honesty Enzio is probably the coolest fictional old guy since the Dos Equis guy..\n\nEnzio finds himself in Constantinople, on a mission to discover the secrets of Altairs (the assassin from the first game, for those who don't already know)  Waltzing up and just going into the library would be too easy.. we are talking Assassin's Creed here.  So after a nice little tutorial missing you're thrust into Constantinople, all alone, broke, and injured..  The story picks up from there...  or it doesn't depending upon how you look at it..\n\nThe Gameplay..  it's fairly familiar by this point, run, jump, collect, kill, sneak... a few major additions in this game was the hook blade, a nice little addition, also you can now create bombs, lethal, stun and Smoke varieties..  These are pretty much game changers once you get used to how they work..  Another addition is red and yellow trails when you open up eagle sense.  It's kind of cheap in all honesty, but sometimes you just want to watch the world burn..   Towers used from the last game are back.. only now they are no longer called Borgia towers (since the Borgia family was pretty much removed from the AC universe in the second game)  Now they are known as Dens, which you unlock to gain a new hideout for your assassins.\n\nAnother neat addition to the game was den defense.. (which is a simplified tower defense game), while the concept was pretty neat, in 24 hours of playing, I only managed to initiate 2 den defenses.. The first tutorial one, and the second one happened not too long after that..  It wasn't for lack of trying as I left my suspicion meter in the red for hours, and paid close attention to the map, wandering around various parts..  Needless to say I think this aspect was broken in my game for some reason..\n\nThe recruitment system is back, and it's been expanded upon quite considerable.  You can now reach level 15 with individual assassins, and you can set them as leaders of the individual dens.  Furthermore, the quest system seemed to receive an overhaul as well.  Now you can have your assassins take over a city, (instead of just quest there)  when you're in control you receive cash, experience and bomb making materials.  A neat addition to say the least, especially as money in this game is fairly difficult to come by until you've opened up almost all the shops and banks..\n\nAs well as playing Enzio, you'll get the chance to play as Altair.. although his missions are fairly limited but are really interesting and help show what became of Altair after you left him..\n\nOverall..  I'd recommend this game, although after playing Assassin Creed 2 and Brotherhood, this game felt like more of the same, where as the previous games seemed to get better as time went on.  Although it could have just been me starting to get burned out on Assassin Creed.  Also the game didn't feel quite as epic or as well put together as the previous 3 games.. Not just the story but the bugs, glitches, and general unstable nature of the game.. especially when closing the program down, which crashes 90% of the time.  Almost inexcusable at this point in time, matters are made worse because the crashing often times results in a locked up computer.\n\n*Quick Note.. Multiplayer is still alive in this game, but it's pretty much on life support.  After playing Multiplayer long enough to get level 20 I can say that any new comers to multiplayer will be in for a very daunting task.  You'll likely be matched with level 50's who have all the best perks equipped..  Although after I gained some levels and learned the game it was more fun than I expected.. Although some things a bit cheap, that comes with almost every online game..","February 6","true","32.9"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","27","32","2","2"

One major problem with Revelations is that the size of Constantinople seems dwarfed by Rome from Brotherhood, despite the fact of it being 3x the size at the times the game take place.  The campaign is also noticeably shorter and playtime is likewise surprisingly shortened.

I am genuinely impressed by how much this game has to offer. It is not so much a revolutionary improvement of the AC formula but instead a perfection of almost every single mechanic in the game. Since this is the fourth game in the series you can clearly tell that they have had a lot of time to improve and polish every detail of their now distinct form of combat, stealth, free-running and so on.\n\nAlthough the combat is still pretty much the same as in brotherhood the animations have been cleaned up and a lot of new ones added. This makes the combat feel very fluid and the addition of the hook-blade makes for some extremely awesome and brutal finishing moves. Even though this is still the same parry and counter based combat from the previous games, it has been polished to perfection and is the best the series has ever seen.\n\nThis game does a great job of tying up the stories of Ezio and Altair leaving you with a very satisfying conclusion and setting up for a new assassin in the next game. The storytelling mechanics that the game employs are superb and make use of inception like memories inside of memories. This is complemented by a less exiting but still interesting story about the sultans of Constantinople and their struggle for power. While this may not be as good as the conspiracies of the second game, it serves as a well fitting background for the main story of Desmond and Ezio.\n\nIn my honest opinion this is my favorite AC game so far and well worth your money.","June 1, 2015","true","16.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","0"

Bribing an official will loose 25% (But you can't always find them) and killing an eye witness who never witnessed you commit a crime will loose 75% (they too can be hard to find), but they are usually protected by guards and if you are seen attacking them your notoriety increases again.\n- If you are notorious for a certain amount of time templars will attack your dens and you will have to take them back using the tower defence game.\n- Recruiting assassin's is slightly different, where you would have killed a group of gurards you now have to do a quest or race them. It gets to the point where you don't want to recruit them.\n- A new weapon if forced onto you for the whole game, the bomb is rarely needed and in my opinion doesn't belong in the game.\n\nI haven't tried the multiplayer (I never really liked MP in AC) but I imagine the multiplayer is dead given the age of the game.\n\nThere is probably a few things that I have missed but I would only recommend this game if you are a fan of the series and you want to see a conclusion to two of the best protagonists in the franchise.

All good stories must come to an end and the superb character of Ezio, whom you played with since that first fist-fight in the streets of Florence, all the way to the very last sequence in Revelations, could not have wished for a better ending.\nThe game goes on as you might expect, though everything is again technically enhanced and better than in the previous installment. Ezio continues to be a spiffy, sharp-tongued and cavalier signiore, who blends beautifully into a superbly designed Ottoman Konstantinople, where you can feel as if in a real city, with markets, slums, palaces and all. Sure there are the continuing problems, such as guard intellect and the fact that they simply can’t seem to remember that you were the guy who just now killed someone, and there is this new addition of bombs which is just a little bit too much, however all in all, the game delivers.\nThe ending of the game, in how it is sequenced, and Ezio’s words both towards Altair and as to his own life, could not have been said better and although there is a sadness in seeing this great character leave, there is also the satisfaction that it simply could not have been done better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/201870/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","Assassin's Creed: Revelations is the 4th mainline installment of the Assassin's Creed Franchise and as such I'll start by saying if you haven't played at least Assassin's Creed II then the events of this game might just be going over your head. However in terms of raw gameplay it's still a fun game, with fairly basic combat mechanics which are coupled with some crazy death animations (and of course the craziness of ragdoll physics). Many a demented cackle has been produced as bodies have been flung, or barged off of a tall building - I should probably seek help...\n\nThe missions and quests are fairly generic, and if I'm honest there aren't too many standout moments in the game mission wise aside from the final run (which is now becoming something of a trademark in the Assassin's Creed series). Storywise I felt again the game never really got going while playing, yet looking back it clearly did. This was a far more streamlined Assassin's Creed game compared to the other installments, and a quick check of the played time shows I managed to complete the main storyline within 13hours of gameplay.\nThis could mean one of two things: There was a reduction in superficial sidequests to advance the mainstory; or I simply didn't bother exploring and living in the world.\n\nThe Story content itself is finally satisfying, as in previous Assassin's Creed games they never really explore the actual origins of the Brotherhood. Thankfully this game does, and it presents it in such a way that it finally ties the first Assassin's Creed directly into the rest of the franchise (rather than it being some previous ancestor of Desmond that he's forgot all about). If I'm honest, I think I preferred the small glimpes into Altiar's history, and the 'payoff' was nice. Of course Ezio's story is progressed along nicely too, and he's aged, has changed slightly and has a rugged man beard that inspired The Last of Us.\nThey even manage to build up Desmond's character, even if he is in a coma and trapped within the Animus! And of course there's some ball twisting progression of The Firsts in there too.\nSo overall Revelations managed to bring together the 3 (all in 1) Main Characters of the Franchise and progress them along nicely. I just feel like the City's mission was a little lacklustre as the fight between the Ottomons and the Byzanite's wages across Istanbul. I never really felt I was involved or playing a critical role in the outcome - perhaps I'm missing the point and Ezio wasn't a crucial figure in those events.\n\nThe city design itself is an interesting one too, as I felt way more relaxed playing the game. It didn't feel as open or as grand as Italy in ACII or Rome in AC: Brotherhood. It was close and pretty low profile, and for some reason it didn't feel as though I was ever in any real danger, despite the game's attempts to throw danger at you in the form of the 'Awareness' meter.\nWhich brings me onto the Assassin's Den Management subgame - it never triggered for me. Perhaps I was a great Assassin Master who managed to keep the Assassin's activities a secret from the evil Templars, but outside of the pre-planned tutorial on the Tower Defense Sub-Game, it never happened again in the 13 hours I played the game.\n\nOverall I'm happy I played Assassin's Creed: Revelations, as it does do some fan service to tie all of the loose character plots together, and brings Desmond to life. However, I think at this point if you haven't enjoyed Assassin's Creed II/Brotherhood then Assassin's Creed: Revelations is probably not for you.\n\nOne for the fans.\n","January 8, 2014","true","13.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Not odd as in bad, but odd as in often quite different from previous entries but simultaneously repeating past mistakes. Often, sadly, lacking polish -- it seems like they didn't have time to properly finish this game.\n\nAs always, I will go through the different elements and parts of the game in a haphazard order.\n\nImmediately you'll notice Ezio looks quite different from the previous entry. He is much older, even though only 5 years have passed since Brotherhood. Besides the age, his whole facial structure is different and he has strangely hazel eyes. Not really anything to complain about, it just threw me off since he doesn't really even look like the same character.\n\nThey seem to be trying to go for the 'weary traveler in search of answers/far away from home' sort of character development with Ezio here. That works out okay. The story in this game is, at the very least, better than AC1, II, or Brotherhood -- not to say that is much of a standard.\n\nStyle-wise, we've departed from ACII/Brotherhood. Different UI, enemy types, textures to go along with the Constantinople/Masyaf setting.\n\nFor the music, Lorne Balfe is in charge as opposed to Jesper Kyd this time. He does a great job. The music has its own sound quite different from II or Brotherhood. It's some of the best music in the series. Dramatic and powerful pieces really help bring together the feel of the game -- Ezio's last adventure/searching for answers at the end of a journey.\n\nFor the gameplay, we still have chain kills and assassin initiates you can call on anytime. The game is still absurdly easy, though they made chain kills slightly harder by making the time you have to counter a little less and varying up enemy types -- some are harder to counter/might need to switch weapons. A small improvement, but not nearly enough.\n\nThey added a hookblade and ziplines and the game talks about these things as if they're really important. They aren't. Hookblade is a replacement for climb leap, and it looks really stupid compared to regular double blades. Ziplines just let you...move across rooftops slightly faster? I guess? Again, hardly makes any difference.\n\nThey added a bomb creation system that goes just too far in complexity for anyone to devote time or effort towards. I don't really mean that it is difficult or complicated to understand. I just mean that adding a system that allows for creation of different effects -- distraction, crowd dispersal, AoE attacks, crowd attraction -- should be WAY easier. I shouldn't have to craft that stuff, it should just always be on hand and easily refillable. Good idea, badly executed.\n\nThey added a castle defense minigame for your 'assassin dens' that indicate your control of the city -- like the Borgia towers of AC:B, except you have to defend these. The minigame isn't bad if you're on KB+M, though I know it's not great if you're on a controller. I'm one of those weirdos who plays AC with KB+M and prefers it. It's an okay minigame, but it just seems sort of thrown in there, and lacking any depth or reason to keep playing it.\n\nConstantinople is pretty and large. It is not quite as pretty as Brotherhood's Rome, partly because they decided to apply this gross smoky visual effect over the screen at all times. Besides that, a lot of the city is just colored brown and dark green, just sort of a splotchy vomit color.\n\nSo how is it beautiful then? The citizens, unlike AC1, II, and Brotherhood, actually have more routines and activities in the city. So, atmospherically, it is superior to the previous entries. In the other games, citizens walk around and gather in circles -- that's pretty much it. Here you will see vendors at their shops, fishermen actually fishing, beggars begging, and so on. The populace is lively and realistic, and it helps a lot in making Constantinople worth exploring and experiencing.\n\nFor side content, there is simply much less when compared to Brotherhood. It actually just seems like they didn't have time to finish many missions. There are 'thief contracts' -- but only two. This game has less of the focus on the three factions -- mercenaries, courtesans (Romanies), and thieves. Which is good, it was really odd how ACII/B were so fixated on them.\n\nSo the side content ends up being much less plentiful and it detracts from Constantinople -- just less stuff to do here. The lack of finish is a sad reminder of how they could make these games so much better if they would take their time and not rush them out yearly.\n\nThe story, as I said before, is at least better than the 3 previous entries in the series. There is much more structure, more explanation of Ezio's motives and reasoning for doing this or that, and things happen more naturally.\n\nEzio is looking for answers in Altair's vault, he needs five Masyaf keys, he must search for them in underground crypts and on the bodies of templars/byzantines. He writes to his sister, Claudia, frequently. His letters to his sister are used simply to remind the player of why Ezio is doing what he is doing, what his motivations are for continuing and what his thoughts on current events are. This is very helpful to the player and a huge improvement compared to the simply shoddy storytelling in the previous games.\n\nThe Masyaf keys let us play as Altair in memories that occur after the events of AC1. As I've explained at great length before, AC1 has bad storytelling, terrible voice-acting, and Altair is a stupid character. However, Revelations took this opportunity to make something decent out of Altair's story. He has a real voice actor who actually sounds Arabian/Middle-Eastern and his story has drama, loss, and death all complemented by Balfe's excellent soundtrack. Altair being able to invent and wield a gun in the 1200s, however, is a little silly -- the sci-fi crap doesn't excuse it.\n\nThe separate part of the storyline concerns the heir to the Ottoman throne, the Byzantine templars, and a pair of breasts  known as Sofia.\n\nThe player is sort of expected to believe that Sofia, a twenty-something book store owner, falls in love with fifty-something Ezio, because the developers wanted to give him a happy ending. Whatever, it's dumb but I expect it from these games.\n\nSomehow, the player is expected to care about the Ottoman story but I don't know why anyone would, the game even goes as far as to tell Ezio that it's none of his business by the end anyway.\n\nThey really enjoy bending history when it comes to the Ottomans v. Byzantines business. The Ottoman Empire was quite the utopia and the Byzantines quite oppressive and evil according to this game's revisionist history. These games always slip in highly modern viewpoints about fairness before the law and equal treatment that never really existed in the 1500s to appeal to moderns playing this game.\n\nDesmond is much less annoying because he's in a coma and trapped inside the animus with Subject 16. The first-person platforming sections that go into Desmond's past are just fine, nothing too bad. Worth going through. So that's something of a plus compared to the atrocious dialogue in II and Brotherhood between all the modern characters.\n\nStill, decent enough to be worth playing and having enough that it does better than the other AC games to be worth buying -- so, like Brotherhood, pick it up when it's cheap and go through it.","July 1, 2015","true","44.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

There's nothing wrong with Assassin's Creed. It's a great franchise with unique, compelling and well-designed gameplay. The catch is that we've effectively been doing similar things for the last several years now. Incremental upgrades are more than welcome, but at some point players need a new experience.\n\nThat said, Revelations serves its lead characters well and is a very effective bookend. The improvements in graphics and storytelling, combined with already-great voice acting and music, help make this a memorable finale for some of the most interesting video game characters I've seen.\n\nIf you've been following the lives of Altair and Ezio this long, you owe it to yourself to see their last adventure.","November 5, 2015","true","11.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Basing on that, the title Assassin’s Creed: Revelations is a suitable heading for the third and final instalment of Ezio Auditore da Firenze yet this time, it also tells the story of Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad basically giving both of them the closing curtain call. However, if you want to ultimately see the final chapter, it’s advisable to also see the short film Assassin's Creed: Embers. Nevertheless, even though it’s the final chapter for both of these famous assassins, the game plays out the weakest of Ezio’s trilogy and, unfortunately worse than the first Assassin’s Creed game.\n\nThe franchise Assassin’s Creed grew way too fast in popularity as shown during the past three games. The first had a decent storyline and approach whilst Assassin’s Creed II added many more features that made Assassin’s Creed I look like a tech demo. However, in Brotherhood, even though it’s my favourite out of the four, starting to show cracks in the storyline thus using the ‘band aid’ approach, especially when playing the modern day characters with Desmond and those obnoxious kids. Seriously, it was so messed up, the game can do without them. However, this ‘tradition’ carried on into Revelations yet, this time, those kids played a minor role and thankfully, Desmond now has a backstory via the Animus Shards scattered throughout the map of Constantinople.\n\nRevelations, whilst not a bad game overall, is the game that needs to tie up loose ends from the previous Assassin’s Creed games (including the DS / PSP ones). It looks like Assassin’s Creed was getting way out of proportion with its storyline with plenty of ‘WTF’ moments near the end. It feels like Ubisoft have no idea where this franchise is heading too thus making this game the closing chapter and start fresh if another game was in production (for which it was, titled Assassin’s Creed III). If you managed to get on hold of the Animus Edition, it comes with the Assassin's Creed Encyclopaedia explaining the history as best as they can. It’s a worthwhile addition if you want to stitch up the potholes this game has created. I guess the game can be viewed as the scapegoat, the victim of its own success that had to be released to get some closure to this fantastic series.\n\nFull review here: http://www.gamespot.com/assassins-creed-revelations/user-reviews/2200-12651770/\n\n7 / 10","June 24, 2015","true","75.2"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atrokkus/recommended/201870/","atrokkus","atrokkus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atrokkus/","69 products in account","This game has been getting a lot of criticism, from players and critics alike, but I URGE fans of the franchise to muster all their patience and stay with this game through the somewhat lacking opening and certain annoying gameplay elements. Why? Because Revelations truly shines where it MATTERS — the story. The finale is breathtaking, bringing an excellent conclusion to the stories and lives of two remarkable characters, Ezio and Altair. I will admit that the first chapters may seem somewhat "filler-ish", and Desmond side-story is marred by questionable gameplay, but trust me, your patience will be well rewarded.\n\nReviewers complain about villains, saying they're not "bad" enough (Gamesradar review), not as fun as the Borgias. Way to miss one of the points of the entire series. The game makes an emphasis on the fact that Templars are not "evil", and Assassins are not "good" — those two are merely world views, perhaps one with more merit than the other, but neither is infallible. People fail to realize that Assassins are essentially a terrorist/intelligence organization that forges alliances and "removes" people to further its nebulous cause, a distant idea of freedom, not to "uphold good". And it makes sense that this conclusion is not apparent to those who've only played AC1/AC2/B, since both protagonists were young and foolishly romantic back then. This is why I consider it very important to play Revelations, as it sheds light on the bigger picture of the ancient struggle and the fragility and imperfection of the Creed, through the wise eyes of aging Ezio and Altair. If this fails to move you, then there is exploration of mortality, regrets, retrospective, love of life — Revelations greatly amplifies the beautiful sadness of watching Ezio and Altair's lives come to an end.\n\nAs for the gameplay, combat is a little bit tougher than in Brotherhood (kick-spamming is no longer stupidly effective + enemies are tougher), 100% synchronization in individual missions is quite hard to achieve, thanks to simple but better challenges, such as "lose no health", whereas Brotherhood mostly peppered you with stealth challenges which were rather simple, especially with the crossbow. Furthermore, the Assassin training "mini-game" is now much more rewarding, not to mention that the old and wise Ezio is now a true mentor, who gets a chance to work with individual aspiring master assassins personally, through the assassin side-quests — which, by the way, touch upon the moral dilemmas, "gray area" and the paradoxes of the Creed. AC:Revelations fleshes out the Assassin brotherhood theme MUCH better than AC:Brotherhood, and I'm amazed that so few people recognize this. Your "pet" assassins finally have some sort of personality, and you feel more compelled to keep them safe. Another nice touch is that each assassin randomly chooses favorite tactics and weapon sets (yes, there are even crossbow/hidden blade assassins), and they use bombs, too.\n\nAlso, if you hate the Tower Defense minigame, it's VERY easy to avoid entirely — just make sure you watch your notoriety meter. The only time you're forced to play it is the first den defense "tutorial" mission, and it's hardly something to complain about. Hell, some might even enjoy it (I almost did). You also don't have to craft bombs if you don't feel like it.\n\nI put this game easily on par with Assassin's Creed 2, and as far as emotional engagement is concern, I would put it even above any of its great predecessors.","January 8, 2014","true","29.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I also recommend finishing AC1, in order to appreciate Altair's expanded story.\n\nRevelations is largely more of the same: while a fair portion of the gameplay is repeated from Brotherhood (especially the city quests), it ties up several loose ends with the Ezio, Altair, Desmond and Subject 16 storylines, and adds some fun new features - such as ziplining with the hookblade - which help make it a worthwhile playthrough.\n\nI found the Desmond memories more interesting than the Ezio storyline and enjoyed learning about Subject 16 in The Lost Archive DLC, both of which are set in environments reminiscent of Portal, making a nice diversion from the Constantinople setting. The addition of both the Mediterranean Defence meta-game and bomb-making seemed rather superfluous to the rest of the game but somewhat interesting nonetheless. I would have liked more voice-acting in the Animus database entries, as the feature seems to have been dropped for this iteration.\n\nAfter four games set in very similar locales, I'm looking forward to a change of environment with AC3.\n\n- Skinny from the Fat B*stard (curator link)","February 4, 2014","true","83.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

For starters I loved AC3 even though everyone says it was a disapointment, I really enjoyed it. Now getting back on topic, Assassin creed Revelations will forever hold a dear place in my heart and will forever be in my top 5 games in all time. It has great music but the music was not as amazing as in other games. The game play is really similar to the previous game but the hookblade is added and is a amazing feature that is unique only to this game. The storyline has to be one of the best Assassin Creed storylines I played. The map is kinda cramped but ehh what can you do am I right, you do with what you are given. The reason people get this game and why this game is ranked so high is not because of the hookblade or the new map or the same old mechanics, it is ranked so high because of it's storyline. It's the final game of the Ezio trilogy and it provides the essential closure that every gamer craves and needs to basically needs to not die emotionally. If you are a highly commited fan, and have played the previous games before this game, this game is a must have for every single fan. You can get away with not having a game like Assassin Creed Liberations, but if you do not have Assassin Creed revelations it is like reading a book and not reading the conclusion, the ending.

With his mind shattered and overwhelmed by the memories of his ancestors, the Assassins connect Desmond's body to the Animus in hopes his mind finds its way back to him. Desmond relives the last memories of Ezio Auditore, now a grizzled mentor, who, while retracing the steps of Altaïr, arrives in Ottoman-controlled Constantinople.\n\nPros: The game add new mechanics, among which the Ottoman Hook-Blade that allows ziplining and greater reach in parkour, as well as an interesting crafting system for a variety of bombs. Loot is no longer meaningless, as it now consists of components for the bomb crafting. As opposed to Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, the open-world isn't stretched with large masses of empty land, but consists of one much larger city, Constantinople, whose design is a much better city to run and jump in than Rome was. You must now train your assassins to Master levels and assign them as Den Leaders of neighborhoods you take over from the Bezantine Templars, or risk having them take back control. Also, the exploration "dungeons" are much grander than before, crumbling in your passing rather than just dropping a convenient ladder for when you fall. When Desmond logs out of his ancestor's memory, he arrives on Animus Island, a world template within the Animus' OS, where he can platform through the program and think back on his childhood in the Assassin Farm by unlocking Animus fragments found throughout the game.\n\nCons: The game is very familiar, very much like the previous ones, and graphics haven't seen much improvement. The Tower Defense-like mini game of defending your dens against Templar retaliation just doesn't fit in this action game, nor does the Desmond platforming from The Lost Archive DLC. It is close to impossible to maintain influence in foreign cities through sending your assassins on mission, unless you dedicate yourself to just a few cities, otherwise by the time you complete a sidequest or two your influence will have re-dropped dramatically.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!\n\nAssassin's Creed Revelation is another good chapter of the series, and a great closing to the Ezio trilogy. If you enjoyed the story of the previous games, you'll want this one. But it's once again "more of the same", so don't even consider if you are tired of the mechanics you've been playing with so far.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","June 16, 2015","true","31.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

After being persuaded by a friend to continue playing the game though, I realized the story and detail this game has to offer.\n\nThe game has a slow and rather unintriguing start.  The introduction of the new mechanics, environment and people can drag on and get a little boring, but the game soon picks up.  This edition of the Ezio trilogy takes him to the city of Constantinople, where his aim is to find a way into the library of Altair.  Meanwhile, turmoil is brewing in the city with the dispute over the next Sultanate, and the underground Byzantine templars that are against the Ottomans.  Ezio finds himself in the middle of this mess, and as usual, badass-ness ensues.  As the game progresses, the story gets more intricate, with more historical figures introduced and a few plot twists.\n\nThe environment of the game was different in some ways from the previous settings, but still enjoyable.  The addition of the hookblade made the game so much better, with its ziplines and fast climbing.  From the marketplace to Topkapi Palace, there is a lot to explore and plenty to do.  Oh, and that is without even mentioning Cappadocia, which has a breathtaking environment.\n\nThe gameplay itself was great.  I did not make use of the bombs that much when I played through, which I do regret since it seemed like a great feature.  Despite this, the storyline contained plenty of action and explosions along the way!  Not going to spoil much, but it was certainly a thrill with some of the more advanced weapons that came during the time period.\n\nThere were some downsides to the game, but they were pretty insignificant.  Many criticized the Den Defense feature, which is understandable, but did not affect the game too much.  The storyline only required it to be completed once, and as long as you kept your notoriety low, there was no need to worry.  In the end, it gave players more of an incentive to be careful! :P\n\nI don't really want to spoil any more, so I'll just end this by saying that AC:R is really underrated and definitely deserves its place in the Ezio trilogy.  It delivers great endings to both Altair and Ezio's stories, and certainly makes them memorable.  The game was by no means at ACII's level, but it was still amazing and a ton of fun.","September 24, 2014","true","39.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It has a perfect blend of dialogue and character building with a side of edge of the seat esque action and drama. For those who have played the previous games the story in Revelations will further explain things for you and will send you looking back on them with a nostalgic smile.\n\nMechanics\n\nThe mechanics in Assassin's Creed Revelations are a small improvement on Brotherhood's system. Combat is essentially the same except a little more fluid and with a few extra features added. The combat also has a nice set of new kill animations.\nThe free-running mechanics are fluid, yet clunky in some areas. This clunkyness can cause a few frustrated curses at your monitor/tv screen but it doesn't cause too much of a problem. Revelations also carries over the 'rebuilding Rome' mechanic (except this time you're re-building Constantinople), although I didn't find it that useful this time around as you can get the best gear pretty early on which brings me into the next topic. One of the best swords in the game very early on, and you can get the best armour in the game in sequence five, while these aren't bad things they somewhat ruin the point of renovating Constantinople to earn money so that you can buy better gear. While the mechanics are mostly good, they still have some bad aspects that are frustrating, but not game ruining.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics are superb, not really much I can say against this. They are a moderate improvement from Brotherhood.\n\n---Multiplayer---\n\nAssassin's Creed is now known for some pretty good and unique multiplayer. It combines the superb free-running system with online cooperative or competitive play. There are many game modes to choose from across many levels. The multiplayer also comes with a great character customization system. Revelations added a new feature to it's multiplayer which was the addition of abilities. These abilities can range from things such as making a clone of yourself to decieve other players or to throw a knife at your target to prevent their escape. While multiplayer isn't as active as it once was at the time of this review being posted, it still has a playerbase and you can still find games in most of the gametypes.\n\n---Score---\n\nOverall this game is fantastic. It's a 9/10 from me. It would easily hit the 10/10 if it ironed out the annoying clunky aspects of the parkour system and perhaps added a larger reward for rebuilding the city by renovating shops and the like.","December 17, 2013","true","20.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The graphics were amazing the story of course still great, but it was a bit short. The game I felt came too soon and they could have added so much more! I did enjoy exploring the cities although it seemed to go too fast to explore, and creating the bombs with different ingredients were a fun trip too. The city of Istanbul is were you are located at and it just beautiful! maybe on of the greatest locations so far.

The fight, climb and everything else is pretty much the same thing.\n\nI would recommend for those fans but don't expect anything new about this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/recommended/201870/","wolfrevo","Wolf Revo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/","346 products in account","As with Assassin's Creed Brotherhood you play as Ezio Auditore, this time in the city of Constantinople. Ezio is now looking for several keys to a vault that Altair sealed centuries ago. Each key lets you relive a select memory from Altair's life, which is where the revelations happen. In this way it gives closure on both Ezio and Altair's stories at the same time.\n\nThe game shares a lot of similarities with Brotherhood: the majority of the game takes place in one city where you liberate areas and recruit new assassins who you then send off on missions throughout the region.\n\nGraphically Revelations is definitely the best-looking game in the series so far.\n\nUbisoft made a few gameplay additions to spice things up. My favorite is the new hookblade, which makes climbing a breeze; it also has other applications like ziplining between buildings (why these ziplines are all over Constantinople I have no idea) and the ever-useful hook-and-run maneuver. Bombs are interesting, but I didn't use them much except when the game prompted me to.\n\nAnother nice addition was some backstory for Desmond. As you might know, at the end of Brotherhood Desmond falls into a coma and they put him into the animus to keep him from losing his mind. There you get to play through a few first-person levels that tell us about Desmond's life before he got mixed up with Abstergo. It's nice to know more about the person who you are playing as, and solidifies him as an actual character rather than simply the guy who you have to go through to get to Ezio.\nThe Lost Archive DLC does something similar for Subject 16, and it was very moving. I would recommend it to those who are interested in good storytelling.\n\nThis may have to do with the fact that I completely ignored all side missions during my five hour push to the end of the game, but Revelations seemed much shorter than the previous games in the series. I only spent 19 hours in the game; for reference the amount of time I spent in the other games are as follows:\nAssassin's Creed: 22 hours\nAssassin's Creed II: 39 hours\nAssassin's Creed Brotherhood: 36 hours\n\nOverall I would recommend Assassin's Creed Revelations to those of you who felt that Altair and Desmond felt hollow in the previous games and those of you who are obsessed with plotlines.","December 19, 2012","true","19.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You can pull off some real fancy counters with some even more satisfying sounds.\n\nYou have to have played some of the previous games to understand much of the story but you can try and pick it up as you go.

Note that I wrote "good" instead of "great" or "awesome". It has great potential, but it doesn't develop very well throughout the main plot.\nWhen buying this, expect to be entertained only by the story missions. Not having what to do except to follow the linearity of the game is a bit frustrating.\nUnlike 2 or Brotherhood, this installment isn't as long or extensive, in terms of gameplay time or maps. One has enough money, by the end, only to rebuild about 70% buildings and buy about 70% of what shops offer.\nThe title's setting is Constantinople, which is big indeed, but the whole game is restricted to that ares, except for a few missions which take you to Masyaf or Capadoccia, which are small and not fully explorable, by the way. For movementation, the lack of horses on the city is another downside, as it could be a time saver and more interesting than the fast-travel system for many trips.\nOn the other hand, Revelations earns new gameplay refinements. The addition of bomb-crafting and using definitely makes for a better experience. There is also the new hookblade, which replaces your secondary hidden blade to make climbing easier, faster and more practical.\nStory-wise, it wraps-up Ezio Auditore's story in an interesting way. That is why one should first play Assassin's Creed 2 and Brotherhood to know the main character better and have a better experience.\nOverall, I'd recommend Revelations in case one likes the Assassin's Creed series, but don't expect to be overwhelmed by the amount of content or excitement the assignments bring.","October 14, 2014","true","43.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I would have written a review for the original one since that's the one that got me hooked on the series, but I played that one on the PS3, so I can't review the PC version. Fair enough. I have the PC version now, though, and am planning on playing it.\n\nRevelations, on the other hand, I played all the way through on the PC version. First off, if you've played this game or any of the others on the consoles only, you have no idea what they're supposed to look like. The graphics are astounding. That out of the way, the obligatory "eye candy" factor, what's the game really like?\n\nThe good: As is the case in every previous installment, you can lose yourself completely in this one. You don't have to, but if you want to spend a month playing nothing but this game, you can. On the other hand, and that's another thing I like, if you just like the story, you don't have to invest the rest of your year in it. And it's a good story too. Great dialogue, color and characters that actually feel real with a few twists thrown in on top. As I like to say when I run into that rare creature, the game with a good story, "it would make a great movie."\n\nIt ties up a lot of loose ends too, closing out the stories of Altair and Ezio very well indeed and, quite frankly, even as a fan I was beginning to reach the point where I wasn't sure that Ezio's story, as fascinating as it is, could be milked any further. I like closure. At some point. I'm done with Ezio and Altair now, and not in a bad way. It's all good.\n\nThe bad? The side games get a bit repetitive. At first I was determined to dominate the Med and renovate every public lavatory in Constantinople before I'd finish the game. At the end, not so much. But that's what I like about these games: You can carry on with the side games, quests, mini-games and so on for as long as you like them, and then you can get right back into the story and finish the thing if you've had all you can stand. And you'll STILL end up with weeks of play time. You don't miss out on anything.\n\nExcept for the Desmond's Journey optional side game, which I only made it through the second sequence of before I tired of it. Placing blocks in space and playing first person Tetris just doesn't do it for me, sorry. But I didn't lose anything because of it, so *shrug*. I would have loved to hear all about Desmond growing up, though, but it just wasn't worth it for me.\n\nOverall? A great romp. Beautiful, stunning even, with a story that reads like a book to the point where I couldn't wait to go to the next mission point to find out what happened next. Just like a good book. That with some awesome fight animations, controls that keep getting better and cinematics made for movies, not to mention the awesome soundtrack and it's a very nice package of awesome interactive entertainment indeed. Oh, and with a bit of history thrown in for good measure.\n\nI may be lonely in appreciating the database entries about historic locations and people, but I appreciate them very much. History isn't taught near enough in schools nowadays.\n\n9 out of 10.","November 30, 2013","true","28.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/201870/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Revelations can't be described as a complete disaster. It is an AAA-class title, with fascinating visuals, complex game mechanic and so on. Were it an independent project, with no connections to Animus and stuff, I'd maybe even praised that thing. But as a part of bigger body... it is certainly one of the dumbest volumes in the whole Assassin's Creed series (if not the worst), and can be pictured as a filler into complete AC scenario plot. Rare calculated "breath-taking" action moments fitting an adventure game dissolved in dozens of hours of useless grinding, with the same gameplay mechanics as in the AC Brotherhood, but more spoiled. So if you are still not bought that game, I seriously advise you to hold your hand. At least until you see some really big discount...\n\nWhat I don't like about Revelations? The usual stuff: all those things Ubisoft called as "key features" and "revolutionary gameplay" in their hyped proclamations, in fact don't work as supposed. Broken balance, questionable game plot, and the worst of all - the feeling that I'm not fitting into intended audience of that project. The motivation of protagonist may be suitable for teenager, grown up by Hollywood, but sadly, I can't buy into that crud no matter how hard I try.\nWhat I want to say by that is that Revelations was presented as a game which reveals so much of the Truth, making some serious fixing to the story which started to sink into unwanted tangles and incoherent twists... And it was Revelations that made it all clear: the basic Assassin's Creed story about saving the world and the ages-old struggle of total control and total freedom... it's the least attractive game feature both for players and for game designers.\n\nTo put it simple, all the promised Truth that Revelations "revealed" to the player - not really informative or least entertaining (that especially corresponds to the memories of Altair). The Assassins made a truce with Turks, so they kill political leaders in countries that Ottoman empire desire to conquer and take low profile in return. Was it about just cause? Bringing people more freedom? I doubt that. In this turn, I started to question myself, what's the real difference between Assassins and Tampliers? That question was supposedly answered in the first game, but Revelations severely undermined previous scoops. Now it's more like "bad guys are those who shot at us"... considering the fact it is Assassins who usually shoot first.\n\nOkay, let's forget about history lessons and questionable ethics of the game characters. Let's talk about gameplay, the thing I honor even more than distinct scenario.\n\nIf you were playing before in the Assassin's Creed 2 and AC Brotherhood (which I strongly suggest), you'll see that almost all key features remained the same. You strolling the streets of the big city, climbing the roofs and towers for better sightseeing, you meet new people and kill the most of them... You collect some prize chests scattered across the city, and use money from them to buy new weapons and even new stores and historical buildings. Or don't buy. It is irrelevant, in the end.\n\nIf we talk about anything but main missions in the Revelations, gameplay may provide only conceptual interest. Ezio, now a renowned mentor, nurtures other assassins more than killing himself. Side-missions for levelling your students now taking more and more time, becoming a constant push-pull on the map, where assassins competing with tampliers. Even more, game designers attached a tower-defence mimimi-game, which is so irritating that common advice is to avoid it by any cost. As of Ezio and his abilities, it's safe to say that he's armed to the teeth right about from the start of game. And after he take a hookblade and crossbow - and especially after the first student raise into master level (which can achieved quite early), it's all starting to look like T1000 was sended to the past (to ensure Suleiman's reign, maybe?)... Seriously, all those healthkits, poisons, quite-fast pistol, silent and deadly crossbow... and bombs to send terror into crowds, all that combined feels like overkill. Something like adding half-pound of sugar into (name)Cola bottle.\n\nAt the bottom line, about 5 hours of gameplay can be noted as somewhat interesting - main missions (some of them) and cut-scenes. And again, I must repeat that the scenario there even more grotesque than in the Assassin's Creed 3 (which I thought was impossible...). The only thing the screenwriters performed well is the love-line for Ezio. Taking the full perspective on gameplot leaved me puzzled and even ashamed, for Ezio, for Altair, for Desmond... How so? What's that was for? What was the reason? - those unanswered questions fumed me into this negative review...\n\nMark 6/10.

The characters the collor pallete, everything just *worked*. Pacing was fast and interesting, as well as the ammount of achievments that felt right. (save for a few final missions).\n\nAC2 Revelations is a reskin, that went overboard with with tedious. The awareness factor increases super quick, and killing officials or bribing the heralds only takes it down 25%, not bad, doable, but just buying a shop bumps it 25%+ as well.\n\nThe mini tower defence game is tedious and boring, it yields nothing that you can find in the world which will give you an edge.\nEzio is still amazing, his old age only breeds a more powerfull Alpha Wolf rage that is ready to crush all opposition, and as much as I love Altair, the voice actor is different, so he feels a bit more bland.\n\n\nI bought this game regardless, because I like the cannonical events and want to see what happens to the characters of the AC universe. If you are not OCD about this, and couldn't care about the characters or the story developments, then feel free to skip this game unless it's $5 during a steam sale.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the worst of the games so far, not considering AC3 & Black Flag.","December 8, 2013","false","14.6"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

Again.\nAt this point in the series, you know exactly what you're getting into. The basic gameplay has remained unchanged from the previous game, and the only new gameplay hooks are completely superflous. Bombs are largely useless, except in really specfic situations; the Tower Defence-styled "Den Defending" is not only boring and frusting, but you're likely to not even see it (I had to actually try and get my Infamy up just to see them), and the Hookblade just basically changes your combat and climbing animations, and not much else.\nSo why am I recommending it? Because at its heart, the gameplay still just works. Combat is shallow but cool looking, the world is graphically beautiful (even if Istanbul is far less colourful than Rome and Italy), the full syncronization goals still add great replay value, and fans of the series will definitely want to see the wrapping up of Altair's story. The actual ending to Ezio's story however, is reserved for the Ubisoft-produced film short, "Assassin's Creed: Embers", so make sure to give that a look when you're done the game.\nAlso of note is the incredible "Desmond's Memories" minigame, which is a first person puzzle-platformer where you assemble and place blocks to traverse surrealistic Animus worlds as you find out about Desmond's life before becoming an Assassin. "The Lost Archive" DLC consists entirely of new puzzles and story in this style, and for that reason alone, the DLC is highly recommended. The gameplay in this supposed minigames not only outclasses the main Assassin's Creed gamplay, but with a bit more depth, would easily stand as its own game.","April 21, 2014","true","76.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I really like the decision to give Altair a final conclusion and make it playable. It adds depth to the story and to the lore when you connect these two characters, centuries apart. It gives a nice sense of history. Then, of course, there are the Desmond sections. Personally I've never hated them as much as some, mostly it just seems like a missed opportunity. The potential is there to add a lot to the story but it's just under and/or incorrectly utilized. That being said when it isn't forcing you through inane free running puzzles you do learn a little about Desmond's past, about why and how he ended up where he is.\n\nFor the most part base gameplay is unchanged. The biggest differences are the addition of a hook blade which mostly effects free running (higher climbing jumps and zip lining), bomb crafting/use (use is up to your play style. You don't have to use them but they can be useful), and a tower defense mini game that is thankfully entirely optional (which begs the question "why is this in the game?"). The combat is a little less of a grind with the counter-kill/kill-stringing system which can have you speeding through a group of enemies in a flash. Although the ability to kill an entire group of guards without breaking stride makes you wonder why they bother having the fights in the first place. Unfortunately this tweaking of the combat system has continued the trend away from actual planning and assassination toward big raging battles and waves of enemies. There are a few forced stealth sections but those are almost always very linear with a clear path and sequence of actions. It's really a shame because they give you so many weapons and skills but don't really give a lot of ways to fully utilize them in a stealthy way.\n\nOverall this really is one of the better games so far in the series. The game world is still huge and beautiful and stabbing guards in the neck from the third story doesn't really get old. If you've played the rest of the excellent Ezio story arc then this is a must play. If you haven't then you should go play the others first then pick up Revelations.","January 10, 2014","true","71.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game takes all the good things from Brotherhood, like focusing on a single city, establishing likable characters early on and quickly giving you parkour assisting tools instead of holding on to them.\n\nAs far as the story goes, I found myself really intrigued in Ezio's storyarch. Coming straight on from Brotherhood and II, I found the pacing and overall storyarch a lot easier to care for in Revelations, and it ties it all together very nicely. There is a clear improvement here, as the story is now easy to follow and doesn't miss out on important information, which was the case of the previous iterations. However, the biggest thing is the way that Ezio's personality has progressed over these games, evolving from a young, arrogant and revengeful youth in Assassin's Creed II, to an insightful, skilled 50-year old in Revelations. The way that Ubisoft has written Ezio's personality in Revelations is nothing less than incredible, his wit and humour contra his old age and battle scars works very well in creating a likeable and interesting character. Not that Ezio has ever been anything else, but it is far more prominent here.\n\nThe setting is also completely different this time around, instead of travelling all across Italy doing his Assassin-y stuff, Ezio goes to (what is currently) Turkey, more precise Istanbul (Constantinople) to find out what is hidden behind Altaïr's super secret vault. This was something I was scared about, because I thought I wouldn't like this setting, I thought it wouldn't fit the universe and character, but I was very, very wrong. This is the best setting for an Assassin's Creed game so far; not only in the amount of rich history but also the way that the city is built. It is far, far easier to find your way around in Istanbul than in Roma (or Firenze, Venezia, Jerusalem, Acre or Damascus), even without using your mini map. I soon found myself rememering streets and where to easily hide from guards. The game also looks great, even in 2013; some textures might be a bit low-res but most of the time it looks stunning.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much the same as brotherhood, with the exeption of the hookblade, which basilcy replaces the long-climb-grabby-gauntlet-thing from II and Brotherhood and it's very, very handy. Otherwise the parkour gameplay os as solid as it was in Brotherhood and the combat is as dull as it's always been. Looks great tho.\n\nIn the end i consider Assassin's Creed Revelations to be a great, great game that is a must-play if you've played the other games. As far as it goes for newcomers to the games I don't know, you do get a recap in the beginning, but you might miss out on a lot of the references and why Ezio acts as he does sometimes.","January 23, 2014","true","11.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/recommended/201870/","abedsbrother","AbedsBrother","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/","525 products in account","If you've played Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, don't expect much new in the way of game mechanics. If you're looking for a great conclusion to the Ezio story, then you will love this game. If you haven't played Assassin's Creed before and are looking to get into the game, don't go for this one first. You'll be wondering what is going on for much of it. Try the original Assassin's Creed or Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.\n\nStory:\nEzio - spends most of his time in Constantinople, looking for the keys to the Masiyaf library. Along the way he'll tangle in local politics, romance a charming woman, and of course climb and sneak around looking for all those hidden loot caches.\nDesmond - he is put into the Animus by a certain someone (no spoilers) to prevent the onset of madness after the events at the conclusion of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. He needs to untangle the strands of his mind (reaching a "sync nexus") to be certain of his sanity before returning to the real world.\n\nSetting: Constantinople (Istanbul). The city looks glorious. Ubisoft clearly spent a lot of time on the look and feel of the city, and this is arguably one of the greatest successes of Revelations. There are also numerous caves to climb / explore, as well as a wonderfully atmospheric excursion to an underground settlement.\n\nGameplay: If you've played Brotherhood, you know what to expect. Combat is nearly unchanged. Store renovations are everywhere. Recruiting new Assassins is unchanged. There is a new "tower defense" mini-game. Seize Templar towers (a la the Borgia towers from Brotherhood); but if you acquire enough notoriety, the Templars can take them back. Sounds good on paper, but unless you are just completely careless (or don't care about notoriety), you'll rarely see this mini-game after the tutorial. For moving about the city, the "hook blade" has been added, basically allowing you to zip-line all over the city. It works well (and is required for the completion of several timed missions), but the zip-lines only work in one direction, limiting their usefulness. There's bomb crafting, which is useful in some situations, but isn't required. And - that's about it.\n\nAssassin's Creed: Revelations is the perfect conclusion to the Ezio triology, but it would be a mistake to think of it only interms of Ezio. To get the full impact, you need to not only have played the first (original) Assassin's Creed, but have also engaged with it on an emotional level. Then, having played through Assassin's Creed II and Brotherhood, you start Revelations with a return to Masiyaf. This is a great moment that had a lot of impact for me. Also memorable were several flashback scenes where you play as Altair once again. Even if these sequences weren't tied into the narrative, they would still be fun. But they are. The story of AC: Revelations is arguably the strongest of the entire series, as it effortlessly weaves three narratives - Desmond, Ezio and Altair - into a complicated tapestry that makes absolute and complete sense. And the final conclusion - which I won't spoil - truly contains revelations of the highest order. I could not imagine a more satisfying ending to the Ezio Auditore trilogy, who IMO is one of the best characters ever created in any media.\n\nMultiplayer is pretty much dead, making The Ancestors Character Pack and the Mediterranean Traveler Map Pack moot and near-pointless DLC. The Lost Archive DLC, however, is essential. Maybe the game-play time is short (2-4 hours), but story-wise it focuses entirely on Subject 16 and his story of betrayal and madness.","September 5, 2014","true","45.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

From his birth, we have seen this man age and become an elder. A process you in the beginning feel quite a bit.\nThere is a beginning section where you are wounded and need medicine, limiting your climbing abilities and forcing you to make do with what you have, which are haystacks. A nice way to get people gradually reacquainted with how you do things in the AC series.\n\nConstantinople is now your playground. Everything you could do in Rome, can now be done there, and more. The Hookblade serves as an additional climbing method. Whereas in Brotherhood, you could leap and grab hold of a normally unreachable spot, you can now use this technique to climb even faster by launch yourself a second time. A rush to do several times in succession, though for some reason it still functions perfectly for dual assassinations.\n\nBombs can be put together now as well, allowing you to carry three types. To distract, to kill and for tactical purposes. For every type, you can put together several ingredients with different effects befitting their purpose. Distracting bombs will usually distract guards and such, while lethal bombs will kill in various ways. Tactical bombs can range from smoke bombs, to bombs that drop fake coins to lure a crowd of people, and much much more.\n\nWhlie an excellent game, I can't say that you'll be able to fully appreciate the game and story if you haven't played it's predecessors.\nIf you have been following the AC storyline, you'll enjoy the progress of Ezio and the hidden history of Altaïr. Especially the latter's closure is a potentially emotional one.\n\nA worthy end to a storyline focussed on an Italian Assassin.

As fans of the series will appreciate raised the veil of secrecy over the fate of Altair what happened to him after the end of the original. These episodes are short, and all we have collected from five pieces, but memories of the protagonist of Assassin's Creed for the number one, perhaps, the best moments of Revelations. And reveals a character in less than two hours better than the entire length of the first part.\n\nBut the central face of the story, of course, is old audience. Before us is a life already wise, experienced a lot of hardship and bitter lessons, a man of fifty-two years. But age - not a hindrance still playfully jumping on the roofs. Is that the place of Venice and Rome came to Constantinople (now - Istanbul), divided into two large water area. Swim from one to the other will not work, so I have to use a system of fast sewer tunnels (the good, this time some of them are open from the beginning), or hire a boatman, a taxi driver.\n\nBut before you go to conquer the cultural capital, Ezio will visit the fortress of Masyaf. There must be a hidden secret library of the Assassins, which houses a terrible secret. And we should in that that was the first to find five keys to the door and it does not give the Templars get their dirty paws on the ancestral knowledge. The adventure will be exciting, especially failed entry and smart, a strong finale. The only pity is that in the middle there is a noticeable sagging.\n\nStar, but removed\nTo carry out this very good mission will have the old ways. As before, we have to be worn on the roofs of the beautiful city, hidden in the crowd, and expertly clean goal. Tasks are varied and a good imagination. For example, one would have to change a traveling musicians performing in front of all of society and color eye-catching, while your minions-assassins quietly sent to the bottom of the well of another Templar. And such original instructions are not enough. Generally, Revelations, unlike its predecessors, most focused on the story. Create your guild kills, pumping recruits and buying buildings unobtrusively offered as a short rest in between missions. No side orders and the competition is not provided. The only thing to do in town, so it is rare to weigh cuffs bullies, but to catch the thieves. And the modest size of Constantinople the same Rome.\n\nAt first glance, to distinguish the "revelation" of the sequel or Brotherhood is difficult. Mechanics, control and brotherhood economic part have not undergone any changes. But, of course, the developers could not leave his project completely without innovation, but they seem to be strained at times and sucked from the finger. For example, now our excesses in the streets much more serious consequences. If the anger of the Templars or the custody of the Ottoman Empire, and take away time from the suspicion, you have to reflect their attack on your base captured. Completed this part of the game as a simple little variation on the theme of tower defense. On a narrow street on the headquarters of the guild systems brave marching troops of the enemy, and we set on the roofs along the road of various fighters and build barricades on the road. FUN, this is simple and at first even like, but get tired very quickly. Therefore we recommend to you as soon as possible to get a masters Assassins (students pumped up to level 15) and instruct them to defense.\n\nAnother innovation is the bomb - a new weapon in our arsenal. On the one hand they are useful: they can be used to distract enemies, destroy them or to demoralize and disorient. Recipes - Sea. Experimenting with various integral components, which are abundant in the trunk or on the corpses, we can get explosive movement with very different characteristics. But here's the situation when they really need, are extremely rare. Of course, you can actively use them, but it is almost always much easier to operate the old fashioned way.\n\nBut the most small, but among the most useful upgrade uniforms became a hook knife. Thanks to him, acrobatic part has become more dynamic and diverse. If you can not reach out his hand to the ledge, then a new "gadget" you will gain. As well as make it easy to bring down the opponent with the legs, jump with pots and lamps mounted to slide on and pull a cable. Particularly effective in the latest version jump to head to some poor fellow-guard.","May 29","true","60.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/201870/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","Assassin’s Creed: Revelations is the 3rd game to feature Ezio Auditore, and the 4th game overall. While it doesn’t really move the present-day plot along very much, it does conclude both Ezio’s and Altair’s (the protagonist of the first game) storylines, effectively wrapping up every major loose end before the start of AC3. The game primarily features an older, mid-16th century Ezio, on a quest to learn more about Altair and the Assassins. This leads him from Masyaf to Constantinople, where the majority of the game takes place.\n\nThe new setting of Constantinople is visually nice and as usual is a cool place to explore. However, it feels smaller than previous games. My feeling is that making this game was most definitely more of a financial than a creative decision. In other words, because of having to crank out a new game on a yearly basis, the scope of Revelations had to be reduced. This is not only reflected in the smaller size of the world, but also in many of the creative aspects. There are no major changes to the established formula that one might expect from a series on its 4th iteration. The mission types and game mechanics are all pretty much the same as in Brotherhood and AC2. Luckily, that means that the game is technically near-flawless... however, on the flip-side, it’s creatively a bit stale.\n\nThe one major thing that Revelations introduces is a sort of "tower defense" sub-game, which involves (you’ll never see this one coming) defending towers using various types of Assassins and defenses. However, this is an odd addition, as I came to find out, it can potentially be avoided entirely. You see, these missions supposedly only pop up when your notoriety gets too high, but if you manage to keep your notoriety low and assign Assassins to each of your towers (as I did), you will never experience this mini-game beyond the initial tutorial. I had completely forgotten this was even a thing until I was just now thinking about what new mechanics were added to this game. So unfortunately I can’t speak to how good or bad this new addition was. It just seems an odd choice to add this whole mechanic and then not have it be a mandatory part of the main game.\n\nOne other new gameplay addition comes in the form of a series of optional 1st-person puzzle levels. These are available in the present day Desmond sections, and serve as a way to tell the story of his past. These levels are really hit or miss. The 1st-person controls are awkward and the abstract nature of the levels is a bit odd. I thought the idea was interesting, but eventually the whole process became quite tedious. Your mileage may vary on these levels. They are completely optional, however, so there is nothing lost by avoiding them, except some Desmond back-story. Incidentally, there is also a DLC pack featuring similar levels which fills in the story of Subject 16 (Desmond’s Animus predecessor) and Lucy Stillman. If you like the style of these levels, you may be interested in checking that out, but I’m not sure it’s worth the price (I recommend just watching the important bits online).\n\nAt any rate, the main draw in this game is clearly what it does to conclude the storylines for Altair and Ezio. For that reason alone, it’s worth checking out if you are a fan of the series or either of those characters in particular. However, just keep in mind that other than that, this game is literally just more of the same, with little innovation. If you played the previous games and find yourself tiring of the AC formula, Revelations likely won’t satisfy you from a gameplay aspect. But, if you can handle one more round of the same thing, this is a nice ending to the first part of the AC story, and worth checking out.\n\nGrade: B\n\nNote: I don’t recommend playing any of the Assassin’s Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.","February 13, 2013","true","29.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

A hefty promise, but the real question is, will it succeed?\n\nIt´s no easy task to juggle three main characters at once, but Ubisoft has done a remarkable, if incomplete, job. There´s no denying that Ezio and Altair´s portions are handled extremely well, providing insight into both of the character´s final days as the emblematic assassins they are, and getting to know what happened after the credits rolled in the first game of the series is an absolute delight, but the same sadly can´t be said for Desmond´s sections. Although its evident that the developers tried to take a different aproach to the familiar gameplay by giving it a first person treatment, the final product comes out as uninspiring and dull.  Nevertheless, the overall storyline more than makes up for it, and rounds up these characters on a high note.\n\nFortunately, Ubisoft made absolutely no mistakes with regards to the audiovisual style, maintaining the excellent values proposed by both ACII and Brotherhood, and manages to set the bar even higher with sharper details and fantastic voice acting. The beautiful city of Constantinople takes center stage, a breath of fresh air just when Italy was beginning to feel a little stale at the end of the previous entry in the series, and cements the franchise´s reputation as one of the most stunning ones around.\n\nThe gameplay aspect remains almost untouched compared to Ezio´s other adventures, but giving that it was superb in most of its aspects, that doesn´t really count as a negative, although a little more innovation wouldn´t harm, either. Notable additions to the formula include the trusty hookblade, which allows you to extend your reach and prevents you from falling to your death (a regular in the series), an improved use of bombs which range from lethal to tactical and sneaky, and the ability to defend your captured dens via a tower-defense-like minigame which feels like un unnecesary step in the wrong direction, even though it can be fun the first few times.\n\nThe multiplayer portion first introduced in Brotherhood makes a return, and even though it sports a few new flashy additions, doesn´t provide enough content to keep you away from more complete online experiences for long. It´s a nice complement to the main adventure for sure, but one which, if given a little more polish, would have been up there with the genre giants.\n\nOverall, the game is a considerable leap from the previous title, which felt rather disappointing and "safe", and does enough things right to distance itself from it and stand high among the franchise´s best offerings, surpassed only by the magnificent Assassin´s Creed II.  It can only get better from here...\n\nPros:\n\n+ Beautiful open world crammed with things to do\n+ Breathtaking visual and audio design\n+ Engaging plot which overarchs two of the most loveable characters in gaming and brings them together like never before\n+ Long, varied campaign which tosses you in a variety of engaging scenarios\n\nCons:\n\n- Uninspired Desmond sections\n- Engaging, yet short-lived multiplayer component\n- Feels  somehow similar to previous entries\n- No more Ezio and Altair :(\n\nConclusion: A fascinating adventure which closes the lid on one of the most gripping stories of modern gaming, Assassin´s Creed Revelations grabs hold of you and doesn´t let go until you have seen everything it has to offer, and believe me, that is going to take some time, my friend.\n\nGrade: 9.1 (Amazing)","May 22, 2014","true","27.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","3"

It seemed that all the same colors really just ran into eachother creating a big blob of desert color. The actual gameplay really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off because you could be just climbing a building and then boom, Ezio just jumps off and you die and start for the last check point, this was a real downer for me. To generalize the gameplay was really rugged and i didn't feel like an assasin, i fealt more like an elephant that kept randomly jumping off buildings and tripping over my feet. All in all I still finished the game because really wanted to get the story and not just go to the next game and just be like ....what? and I am not really the type of person to just look it up on the internet.

Too many gameplay elements are forced in that have no place in AC.

Don't try deviating from your pre-aproved path, free running, but not free.\n\nThe story is generaly weak or at some points just downright stupid, the only redeeming part is is a good ending.

On the one hand the game offers up a lot more answers and insight into the story arcs of Ezio Auditore, Altair Ibn La'Ahad, Desmond Miles and the struggle between Templar and Assassin but at the same time the entire thing feels like it's tied together very loosely.\n\nAssassins Creed 2 and Brotherhood featured Ezio Auditore struggling against the Italian Templars first as a means for personal revenge and then as a true Assassin fighting against tyranny. With the shift to Constantinople both Ezio and the player feel like complete outsiders with no real stake in the budding conflict between Ahmet and Selim over the Sultanate. The entire expereince is even ironically summed up at the end of the game when Ezio is told to leave and never return - leaving any and all of the player's victories and failures feeling hollow.\n\nTo make matters worse Revelations is the first installment in the series to really not bring anything new and ground-breaking to the franchise. The biggest additions are the hookblade and the bomb making but both of these things feel like they were just added out of necessity rather than as interesting and enjoyable features.\n\nThe most outlandish of the new "features" however is Desmond's Journey (and later the Lost Archive DLC). Seperate from the main game, these portions have you navigate puzzles and obstacles from a first-person view while learning more about Desmond Miles and Clay Kaczmarek (Subject 16). While the concept is interesting it just feels out of place and as a result kind of unnecessary.\n\nThe multiplayer however did see some improvements - namely the introduction of Deathmatch and Capture the Flag game modes as well as the ability for players to customize their characters' clothing and weapons.\n\nOverall I believe Revelations' real issue stems from the fact that it's trying to cover too many bases at the same time. Attempting to tie up loose ends between mutiple characters spread out over different time periods and games, moving the main modern day story arc along, AND giving the player a new location with a new historical story-line and characters proves to be too much for Ubisoft to stuff into a 25+ hour title and in Revelations' case it definitely shows.","February 2, 2013","true","30.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story continues with Desmond and Ezio. If you followed the AC series then this will be an excellent addition to your list. The physics and overall gameplay has been improved, but as usual sometimes they just don't do what you want. Hopefully with improvements in the games this will be better in future. Overall the story remains as excellent and puts more light on what happened. Additional videos and content are only available on the other side of the world though.\n\nThe one problem that most followers of the series will have is that the version available in the US is much more limited than the ones available in Australia for example. Additional maps and characters, items and side-stories that are not available and are region locked made many shy away from this. Personally I only purchased it because I got a coupon for 50% off - else I would not have purchased it for the original price without the perks that are available elsewhere.","March 31, 2012","true","73.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Historisch und proportional korrekt nachgebaut, kommt sofort das tolle "Jaaaaaaa-hier-darf-ich-rumlaufen-Gefühl auf". Sehr gut gelungen.\n\nPunkt II: Die Story - Gut gelungen, wenn auch kurz\n\nKurz und knapp wie auch schon in Brotherhood erzählt Revelations eine vergleichsweise gute, schnörkellose Geschichte, wobei es den größten Nachteil aus AC II nicht wieder ins Spiel bringt. Ein zwei Twists sind auch mit dabei - alles in allem für ein AC-Spiel wirklich angemessen.\n\nPunkt III: Der Held - Ezio\n\nGleiche Animationen, nur 2 neue Tricks (Hakenklinge im Kampf und Hakenklinge bei der Fortbewegung) - Ezio hat sich nicht viel verändert, nur dass er jetzt halt um die 50 Jahre alt ist. Seine Kampftechnik beeinflusst das nicht, im Gegenteil, er lernt sogar noch brutalere und assassinigere (ist das ein Wort?) Killmoves. #\nSein Charakter bleibt auch nicht auf der Strecke, denn seine freundliche, inzwischen natürlich weisere Art wird angemessen, aber nicht übertrieben betont.\n\nPunkt IV: Das Gameplay\n\nWie Schon in Punkt III erwähnt, so hat sich das Gameplay nur um 2 Tricks erweitert - Die beiden Eigenschaften der Hakenklinge, die man für's Klettern, für's Seilrutschen und für's Hinterhältig-töten nutzen kann.\nDeutlich stärker macht einen das nicht, aber wann waren der Kampf oder das Klettern in Assassin's Creed schon schwierig? Das einzige was es tut, ist cool aussehen und sein, und die Steuerung ein wenig erleichtern - was es wohl auch soll.\n\n\nFazit:\n\nObwohl die Steuerung, die Grafik, und das generelle Gameplay sich nicht im Geringsten von den beiden Vorgängern AC II und AC: Brotherhood unterscheiden, so ist doch AC: Revelations für seine 15€ auf jeden Fall lohnenswert. Eine Kaufempfehlung für AC-Fans und Neulinge!","August 28, 2014","true","28.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One thing I like is the games change, but still feel like sequels. AC II was a country roaming, assassing vengeance quest. AC Brotherhood was a power building game, build your strength, make your mark, raise you team and then strike. This game is more story based.\n\nThe intro is my favourite to the three Ezio games. Masyaf castle is an excellent setting, and the story is just great. You leave Roma for once and go to Constantinople (Istanbul, Turkey) to follow in the footsteps of Niccolo Polo to retrieve the 5 keys to Altair's library. Excellent game once again, keeping in the same style of the other Ezio games.\n\nHowever, I personally was not a fan of the bomb mechanic that was introduced.

There is plenty to be done in the game as side quests and character evolution: exploring the city, finding hidden secrets, increasing your assassin reputation, puzzle solving, arsenal collection and a new feature, bombs, just to mention a few.\nAs far as the plot goes, it is an incredible wrapping up for the II episode and, unlike AC Brotherhood, all the action is focused on Ezio Auditore, which I really appreciated.\nBoth graphics and audio are a little bit better than AC Brotherhood, but due to the immensity of the world do not expect to get the best out of the market.\n\nOverall, if you enjoyed the previous Assassin's Creed II, this is a must. If you did not played the previous games of the franchise or the episode, I would recommend starting by the the first Assassin's Creed II or, if you're coming from AC Black Flag or AC III and would like to deepen your knowledge of the word, start with Assassin's Creed I, as the storyline will make much more sense.","August 10, 2014","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yet here I find myself at a loss for words. This is the one of those series, that just keeps getting better and better. I think I can count the amount of series that can boast that, on one hand. Revelations takes the amazing parts of Assassin's Creed and adds a pinch of reality. You don't just run around aimlessly butchering stuff, you need to take up the mantle of being the Mentor for the entire brotherhood, you need to direct attacks, organize defense on a much larger scale than you used to, all while attempting to progress the story and learning your part in the grand scheme of things.","December 27, 2011","true","46.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game brings closure to Ezio's story and provides a smooth transition into the next game. Desmond is given more story and there are optional levels where you can learn more about his life by solving puzzles.\n\nRevelations takes Ezio back to the route of Assassin's Creed and has him follow the trail Marco Polo has left for him in Istanbul. At the end of each memory sequence there is an Altair memory which reviells the events following the first game.\n\nAs well as updated graphics and mechanics, this game introduces the hook blade used for moving quickly though the districts but also intresting and original combat tactics. The use of bombs has also been expanded creating unique solutions to large patrols of guards. Ezio can distract guards by creating divertions, frighten them by filling the bombs with lambs blood, or simply blow them up!\n\nAs in the previous two games the notoriety system adds a level of caution to the game steering the player to use tactics and stealth, rather than brute force to resolve confrontations. This, to me, makes a lot of sense as Ezio is an older and even more experienced assassin.\nCouldn't recommend this more espesially as it's normally ont £2.50 on sale!","October 8, 2014","true","21.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though I had tons of fun and loved every minute of it, it just feels like an Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood 1.5. Improved graphics, tweeked gameplay, better multiplayer, and one of my favorite gaming soundtracks to date, it is a solid entry to the franchise. Yeah, it feels a little bit rushed and though the story is good, you can tell Ubi is stretching it. Some new elements are a welcome addition (bombs) and others missed the mark horribly (Tower Defense anyone?).

It would be impossible for him to live much more afterwards. This game is the one that concludes *his* story.\n\nI have to say, the game was okay to me.

The story continues with Desmond and Ezio. If you followed the AC series then this will be an excellent addition to your list. The physics and overall gameplay has been improved, but as usual sometimes they just don't do what you want. Hopefully with improvements in the games this will be better in future. Overall the story remains as excellent and puts more light on what happened. Additional videos and content are only available on the other side of the world though.\n\nThe one problem that most followers of the series will have is that the version available in the US is much more limited than the ones available in Australia for example. Additional maps and characters, items and side-stories that are not available and are region locked made many shy away from this. Personally I only purchased it because I got a coupon for 50% off - else I would not have purchased it for the original price without the perks that are available elsewhere.","March 31, 2012","true","73.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

They added the hookblade, which was a huge addition to climbing because instead of having to grab after you do a jump while climbing, the hookblade locks on and does it for you. It also is useful for the ropes that are around the city like ziplines, along with extending your reach while jumping from rooftop to rooftop. The parachute is also helpful for when you are falling.

That word could define my impressions of AC Revelations. I finished the AC, AC 2 and AC Brotherhood (Oh my god! What a terrible game!) on my PS3. Definietly, Revelations IS the best AC so far (didn't play AC 3, Liberty or Black Flag yet). The history is by far a way better. Maybe just because explains a lot of things (Oh really?! Revelations, right ♥♥♥♥♥?!). The game doesn't wait to the right end to show something really cool, like the previous sequels. There are some awesome action moments, like Ezio's jumping obstacles while dodging bullets and pursuing a boat. The ambientation is a way better than Rome (at least for me). And the mechanics... well, ok! They still ♥♥♥♥♥♥. But I kinda desliked a little less than the previous AC's. Maybe the PC's version is a way better, maybe they really did some improvement. Still, you will continue to climb undesired walls, to jump on undesired ledges and to target undesired people sometimes (a lot of times), but still worth it. The history is freaking cool. It's the first AC's game that I could finished without getting bored and the first that I could finished so quickly. I mean 22 hours in 3 days and a half, not bad for an Assassin's Creed.\n\nAC1 - 7\nAC2 - 7.5\nAC Brotherhood - 6\nAC Revelations - 8","February 27, 2014","true","21.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are a few things that urk me though, for one the character models for Desmond, Ezio and Altair (Clay somewhat included). I loved the way the characters looked in Brotherhood, but now Desmond looks like Adam Sandler, Ezio's head is more of a Gorilla shape/void of emotion, and the first thing I noticed about Altair is that his nose is bigger than his whole face. Speaking of Altair, the voice actor they used to replace him; while I understand the change of accent seeing how he is in that type of area, I don't like the fact that Altair's voice is deeper. Another thing that sort of bothers me is the aspect that your Templar meter goes up everytime you renovate a location, I understand why they put this in considering you're building up in an area where they would be looking for brotherhood activity, but they could have at least implimented more than just bribing Heralds and killing witness.","May 7, 2012","true","29.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like the Assassin's Creed series, you'll probably like this game aswell.\n\nOn the multiplayer side, it has the worst multiplayer game out of all the AC games. The contract system doesn't work that well, smoke bombs are overpowered, the person hosting the server has the advantage due to not having lag, and more.\n\nI still recommend you playing this game for the singelplayer, since it's really good.

This game is great, with an interesting story, top notch voice acting, and a fantastic open world made more fun with the introduction of the hook-blade. Even the Desmond miles story isnt that bad. I thought that this was way better than Brotherhood mostly in part to a more original story not based so much on revenge. You even get to play as Altair again, and this is one of my favorite parts of the game.","February 22, 2014","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As the subtitle suggests, the game brings greater clarity to the overall storyline of AC and adds insight into Ezio and Altair. The gameplay is recognisable and clean and there is a greater graphical clean-ness. The storyline is interesting and enjoyable and adds new weapons and armour.

But It is a nice tie up between Ezio Auditore and Altiar.\n\nYou can build your assassin's up in this game. That part I liked. You can increase your income and free most of the city between the two factions. That part I liked. Keeping your notarity down, swimming, etc. etc. The mounted turret in the later sequence was probably the most hated thing I could think of, not to mention the 75% impossible ♥♥♥♥ to get 100% sequence. It is for more patient people then I to achive that amount of BS. Your "mad skillz" to climb higher walls were replaced with the "Hookblade" which, the idea is nice. It allows you to Counter steal in the middle of battle and get medicine rather then dying becuase brutes done ♥♥♥♥ed up your face. Though most of the heavy armor have been replaced by more skillful guards which makes the challenges very ♥♥♥♥ing hard.\n\nThe story is the only reason why I played this game which, in my opinion, should only be half the reason, not the whole reason you play a game. Without going much into it, you visit Altiar's old home before Constantinople, finding a big locked door and leading you to hunting down keys in the city. True, the plot has completely diverted from "Listen, learn, kill" from assassin's creed 1 to "listen, learn, lara croft treasure hunting" but it really is a nice change of pace. I lost track of why I was killing so many damn people in assassin's creed 2 to be honest. Even the in game diagram didn't help me. Anyways, you help this Sophia in her attempt to get books and civilizations earliest Blu-Ray disks in order to open the library of Altiar.\n\nThe endgame takes a weird left turn as to how people stopped attacking you with the most predictable end in-game. It does explain some of the visions from Assassin's Creed 2 though. All in all, Not my favorite game in the whole series so far, but It's a tie between this and the first assassin's creed. Assassin's Creed 2 is still my favorite so far.\n\nP.S. I'm not too concerned about if this review is helpful or not, I'm just writing these to bookmark if I've played them all the way through or not.","June 24, 2014","true","23.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Knocks against it: they've changed the controls ever so slighttly between this one and the last two games; just enough that you'll die a couple of times in the heat of the moment because you fell back into old habits.  The writing is poor; the first assassination made me wonder if the writeres even understood Ezio's character.  New character models for Desmond and Ezio; can't reaally figure out why Ubi decided to do this for the last game in the series, but by they time you start to get used to it, the game is over.  The mini-games suck; I dont' care about a crappy tower defense, or a bomb-making game.\n\nThings it does right: parkour, and killing.

In some situation you have just the impression that it's all a repetition of what happened in Rome.\n\nFrom a gameplay point of view, I found some improvements very interesting, other simply terrible. I liked very much all the "city conquest" feature, and also the "siege" parts. Also the bomb vrafting was interesting, and the new moves, like the use of ziplines. What i really didn't like were the "animus" sessions, that were in most cases just boring (from a gameplay point of view, whilst they gave some interesting insights about the story) or even annoying. It was a pain for me getting all the achievements, the "impress Warren Vidic" in particular was a nightmare.\n\nThe multyplayer section is enjoyable. Personally the only game mode I like enough is the deathmach, finding the other ones mildly boring, especially at this stage, with 2 chapters went out after ACR, with the volume of player restricted only to some hardcore gamers.\n\nOverall, this game is a must play only for the fans of the saga (that I am!), while new player should probably start from the first chapter, or even (as I read in the reviews) jump directly to the Black Flag chapter.","April 22, 2014","true","332.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That word could define my impressions of AC Revelations. I finished the AC, AC 2 and AC Brotherhood (Oh my god! What a terrible game!) on my PS3. Definietly, Revelations IS the best AC so far (didn't play AC 3, Liberty or Black Flag yet). The history is by far a way better. Maybe just because explains a lot of things (Oh really?! Revelations, right ♥♥♥♥♥?!). The game doesn't wait to the right end to show something really cool, like the previous sequels. There are some awesome action moments, like Ezio's jumping obstacles while dodging bullets and pursuing a boat. The ambientation is a way better than Rome (at least for me). And the mechanics... well, ok! They still ♥♥♥♥♥♥. But I kinda desliked a little less than the previous AC's. Maybe the PC's version is a way better, maybe they really did some improvement. Still, you will continue to climb undesired walls, to jump on undesired ledges and to target undesired people sometimes (a lot of times), but still worth it. The history is freaking cool. It's the first AC's game that I could finished without getting bored and the first that I could finished so quickly. I mean 22 hours in 3 days and a half, not bad for an Assassin's Creed.\n\nAC1 - 7\nAC2 - 7.5\nAC Brotherhood - 6\nAC Revelations - 8","February 27, 2014","true","21.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On the one hand the game offers up a lot more answers and insight into the story arcs of Ezio Auditore, Altair Ibn La'Ahad, Desmond Miles and the struggle between Templar and Assassin but at the same time the entire thing feels like it's tied together very loosely.\n\nAssassins Creed 2 and Brotherhood featured Ezio Auditore struggling against the Italian Templars first as a means for personal revenge and then as a true Assassin fighting against tyranny. With the shift to Constantinople both Ezio and the player feel like complete outsiders with no real stake in the budding conflict between Ahmet and Selim over the Sultanate. The entire expereince is even ironically summed up at the end of the game when Ezio is told to leave and never return - leaving any and all of the player's victories and failures feeling hollow.\n\nTo make matters worse Revelations is the first installment in the series to really not bring anything new and ground-breaking to the franchise. The biggest additions are the hookblade and the bomb making but both of these things feel like they were just added out of necessity rather than as interesting and enjoyable features.\n\nThe most outlandish of the new "features" however is Desmond's Journey (and later the Lost Archive DLC). Seperate from the main game, these portions have you navigate puzzles and obstacles from a first-person view while learning more about Desmond Miles and Clay Kaczmarek (Subject 16). While the concept is interesting it just feels out of place and as a result kind of unnecessary.\n\nThe multiplayer however did see some improvements - namely the introduction of Deathmatch and Capture the Flag game modes as well as the ability for players to customize their characters' clothing and weapons.\n\nOverall I believe Revelations' real issue stems from the fact that it's trying to cover too many bases at the same time. Attempting to tie up loose ends between mutiple characters spread out over different time periods and games, moving the main modern day story arc along, AND giving the player a new location with a new historical story-line and characters proves to be too much for Ubisoft to stuff into a 25+ hour title and in Revelations' case it definitely shows.","February 2, 2013","true","30.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Granted, it's returns to gray moralities is not by giving the Templar characters more noble causes per say, it's more that Ezio does more things that can be contrued as villainous, bad means to an end.\n\nThe story is better, the characters are better, the combat is just as fluid as Brotherhood's, the parkour is improved with the hook blade, and the game just overall feels good.\n\nHowever, the game is also the most linear Assassin's Creed yet, and barring AC1, also features the least amount of side missions. The game does let you feel like a leader through being able to train your Assassin recruits and have them go after specific Templar targets (targets you can play as in the multiplayer portion of the game).\n\nDesmond's section in the game is a strange, optional, first-person puzzle game, it's strangely fun, but there is no worthwhile free-roam section.\n\n90/100","October 20, 2013","true","141.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If that is what you want, that is what you shall receive, but there is very little of note for the game itself. It is hard to recomend it over Brotherhood, and it is far from the high point of AC2, it is simply another formulaic yearly sequel.\n\nThe combat is largely unchanged from Brotherhood, and retains the sense of bloat that was present in its predecessor. While there are 6 ways to kill an enemy from range, you rarely ever need anything more than the throwing knives, a weapon found in every entry of the series so far.\n\nThe missions are somewhat lackluster as well. While the challenge feature from Brotherhood remains present, the "challenge" seems to have been left out. The challenge requirements for most missions are laughably simple, and often can be accomplished without any real difficulty.\n\nIf you want more AC, that is what Revelations offers, but if you just want the pinacle of the series, stick to AC2","July 17, 2012","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Revelations takes the amazing parts of Assassin's Creed and adds a pinch of reality. You don't just run around aimlessly butchering stuff, you need to take up the mantle of being the Mentor for the entire brotherhood, you need to direct attacks, organize defense on a much larger scale than you used to, all while attempting to progress the story and learning your part in the grand scheme of things.","December 27, 2011","true","46.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is plenty to be done in the game as side quests and character evolution: exploring the city, finding hidden secrets, increasing your assassin reputation, puzzle solving, arsenal collection and a new feature, bombs, just to mention a few.\nAs far as the plot goes, it is an incredible wrapping up for the II episode and, unlike AC Brotherhood, all the action is focused on Ezio Auditore, which I really appreciated.\nBoth graphics and audio are a little bit better than AC Brotherhood, but due to the immensity of the world do not expect to get the best out of the market.\n\nOverall, if you enjoyed the previous Assassin's Creed II, this is a must. If you did not played the previous games of the franchise or the episode, I would recommend starting by the the first Assassin's Creed II or, if you're coming from AC Black Flag or AC III and would like to deepen your knowledge of the word, start with Assassin's Creed I, as the storyline will make much more sense.","August 10, 2014","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game brings closure to Ezio's story and provides a smooth transition into the next game. Desmond is given more story and there are optional levels where you can learn more about his life by solving puzzles.\n\nRevelations takes Ezio back to the route of Assassin's Creed and has him follow the trail Marco Polo has left for him in Istanbul. At the end of each memory sequence there is an Altair memory which reviells the events following the first game.\n\nAs well as updated graphics and mechanics, this game introduces the hook blade used for moving quickly though the districts but also intresting and original combat tactics. The use of bombs has also been expanded creating unique solutions to large patrols of guards. Ezio can distract guards by creating divertions, frighten them by filling the bombs with lambs blood, or simply blow them up!\n\nAs in the previous two games the notoriety system adds a level of caution to the game steering the player to use tactics and stealth, rather than brute force to resolve confrontations. This, to me, makes a lot of sense as Ezio is an older and even more experienced assassin.\nCouldn't recommend this more espesially as it's normally ont £2.50 on sale!","October 8, 2014","true","21.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After the events of AC:B, he finds himself trapped along side Subject 12. Subject 12 explains to him that he has to finish what he started in the Animus; finishing the Ezio Auditore storyline, or lose all grip on reality. He enters back into the life of Ezio as he searches for answers at the castle in the first game, only to find it overrun by Templars. After Ezio finishes them, he finds the sacred library of Altiar, only to be locked by some kind of mechanism. He travels to Constantinople to find the keys needed to open the strange door, as well as looking into the life of Altiar as he finds each key. While in the city, he meets up with other Assassins and helps expand the Order, while eliminated Templars along the way.\n\nHere is where is gets a bit messy.\n\nIf you choose to do all of the side quests for the Order, which for me took a few hours at least, you immediately get one of the best armor in the game, even though you technically just arrived in the city. Progressively, your enemies stand nearly no chance against you since your armor is maxed out. Sure, steath is still an important factor in the game and can still be a challange, but overall, combat has never been easier. Not to mention the best weapons are given to you as well. You can still buy landmarks, shops, etc, just like in Brotherhood, and there lies the problem; this is Brotherhood improved/reskin. It feels like a discount Brotherhood. At least, that's how I felt like it is. Hopefully it might just be me. But gameplay overall can be quite easy to manage. As I stated, it feels like a DLC of Brotherhood.\n\nBombs, on the otherhand, is where this game shines the most. You can now be really creative on how you want to kill your targets. You can customize your bombs by making them lethal or non-leathal. From shrapnal to smoke, bombs are fun to use. Except the fact that you can kill literally dozens of civis at once and the game can let you get away with it. Overall, good laughs from this one.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nAC:R is a fun, good game. Not terrific, but not terrible. It has its moments, and is a great edition (story wise) to the franchise that will either leave you in tears, or determined to play the next game for the sake of finishing what you started in the AC world.

II, Brotherhood, and Revalations telling the story of Ezio Auditore is phenomenal. I have heard that the game series starts going downhill after this game.

One of the highlights about this game is you get to know more about Altair from the first game.\n\nLike all Assassin's Creed this one is no different about telling a good story. Like the previous AC installment there is a lot of things to along the way like additional missions to the main, etc.\n\nA good improvement are graphics and how the everything looks (going from the world to the character models); you should be able to find a lot of detail through all the game. As the previous games the music is and it keep being really good and it fits perfectly to what happens.\n\nA clearly great improvement to this game was the multiplayer which was improve in good ways compared to the previous, which of course introduces new modes to play, which feels fresh in the PVP multiplayer world, not the classic run with your gun and shoot everything moving kinda multiplayer; is all about style and how you eliminate your targets. Lots and lots of rewards, challenges and even more context to the Templars background.\n\nAlso, if you got the Lost Archives DLC you will be able to know more details about Desmond's story, like what his past was and some other stuff; this may add some context if you want to know more about the characters; I'll say it will be like an hour or hour and a half of extra content.\n\nBottom line, if you like the Assassin's Creed series, this one will probably be something you like; so, what are you waiting for? get that hidden blade a target and go for it!...","March 26, 2014","true","43.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

New unlocks, character customization options and the return of some Brotherhood maps are very nice additions.

He'd finished the story so I didn't get what had happened. That was Brotherhood. Needless to say he never let me play it.\n\nSteam sale rolls around some years ago, Brotherhood and ACII are discounted so I get them both. ACII was the closest to the first AC and I loved it's story. Brotherhood was the game I never got to play myself, and I enjoyed it but the story wasn't as hooking as 2's. I couldn't decide if I wanted to continue it.\n\nI'm glad I did. Revelations takes the story of ACII, the combat and gameplay of Brotherhood, mixes in the sense that you can only get from a favorite TV show or movie series that this is the end of your favorite character's story, and sets it to cook until well-done. A lot of the reviews I saw for this game only focus on what it was missing so they were lower scored. I'm gonna tell you what I got from this game, and you can decide if you'll enjoy it.\n\nIf you enjoyed ACII's story and Brotherhood's gameplay, you're getting both with this game. There's not much in terms of new things because it doesn't need those things. Revelations' boasts a wonderfully crafted story that at the end will leave you crying(yes, I cried.), the music helps with it's somber lows and action-paced highs(the main menu's looping music had me fighting tears with the vocals), the gameplay has just enough new mixed with old to keep you glued to the controller(or keyboard), and it's cast is at it's finest.\n\nSo any Ezio fans, do yourselves a favor and get this game. If you don't want to play it, look it up on Youtube to discover the end of the Auditore trilogy.

Or at least thats what I did with about 92 hours of my 99 hours of gameplay. (I do not regret it) The other portions of the game that worked were the heroic sendoffs for Altair and Ezio. These characters represent the golden age of the assassins creed universe so it was nice to see them get a respectful sendoff rather then be overused in future cash cow moo creed titles\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe pacing wasn't perfect. The historical research wasn't as meticulous as in previous games. The "Den Defense" minigame is essentially optional... The antagonists weren’t particularly threatening. Horrific Islamic war criminals are presented in a positive light and freedom fighting Greeks seeking to reclaim their homeland are presented as the villains.... (what a brave stance for the developers to take) The tutorial mission and the ending mission are basically the same. You cant steal/use Turkish rifles, you can steal from peasents in front of guards ext.

You may choose to simulate this experience by slapping yourself with a mouse pad.... you know where.\n\nBottom Line.\n\nThe games budget was triple slashed when it became apparent that it would only be competing for market share with Assassins Creed 3. You can see the scope that was intended for the game and literally feel missing content as you faff about. It’s clear that the developers aspired only to adequacy and met it not with leaps and bounds but as a half asphyxiated carcass crawling over the finish line before collapsing but whether it’s by an inch or a mile the game made it. It IS adequate, its pros do outweigh its flaws. So yeah, I liked it, I liked my time traveling Prussian warhammer and my fake ♥♥♥♥♥ Aladdin sword and "macing" peasants was thoroughly amusing. I'd do it again. That said my hope is that they merge ASII, Brotherhood and Revelations into one super title for continuous gameplay enjoyment.\n\nProbably the last real Assassins Creed game.","December 8, 2015","true","99.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game was quite different from II and Brotherhood in that you go from Italy to Constantinople. It in a way feels like a revamped Assassins' Creed I. If you haven't played and Assassins' Creed games prior to this, I suggest you start with I or II and work your way forward. II, Brotherhood, and Revalations telling the story of Ezio Auditore is phenomenal. I have heard that the game series starts going downhill after this game. I have not played them yet, but it would be pretty hard to beat the past three games in my opinion. Anyway, this is one of the best series in gaming, hands down; a must have.","November 6, 2015","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It brings an ending to the story of these two characters, and on top of playing an older, more experienced Ezio, you also get to play some parts as Altair.\n\nMechanics-wise, the game picks up where ACB stopped and adds to the mechanics you know from the previous 3 games. You still micromanage your assassins, recruiting and training them, and you send them out on missions. This time, they don't only bring back money, they can also take over other cities, which will provide you with incoming money and components for the other new addition - bombs.\nThe bombs have a rather complex system... you have three categories, of which you can have three bombs on you. For example, a shrapnel bomb, a smoke bomb (similar to the good ol smoke bombs from ACB) and a cherry bomb, which you can use to lure away guards, distracting them.\nYou can put together those bombs, deciding whether you want them to explode on impact or with a delay, or whether they work like a mine, with a tripwire.\n\nIt's a nice addition, but to me, it's not a total game-changer. You should get used to those bombs and their benefits, and use them (the game will teach you how, and you can also "test" the bombs in a kind of a simulator).\n\nOther than that, it's a lot like ACB... crossbow, assassins you can command and have them attack enemies for you, etc. Climbing is a bit more convenient now due to the new hookblade, which also can be handy in combat.\n\nThe game DOES have a few issues... I had a few crashes (apparently when some popup came up in my taskbar, the game crashed... at least I suspect that to be the reason), while the overall performance was great even at ultra settings.\nThe controls... sigh... well, I do play AC games with an Xbox controller, and I think thats a LOT better and easier than using kbm. However, the controls still are often pretty... imprecise, wonky, weird. You know what I am talking about if you played earlier ACs... jumps going wrong as Ezio will not jump to some kind of ledge, but suddenly jump to the left or right. The hookblade, which will make you climb upwards faster (and allows wider jumps as you can grab ledges with it), might cause you to accidentially do backwards jumps sometimes.\n\nI guess that's the curse of the series... those controls. I noticed a big improvement in Unity (yes, I know, the game has serious issues)... climbing down and fast parcour seems so much easier and controllable in Unity. I can't pinpoint why that is, it just feels that way when I compare parcour and races in ACII/ACB/ACR and ACU.\n\nThe story is a bit confusing (MUCH less so though if you played the previous games and know what the Apple Of Eden is, what the Templars do etc.), and I am not sure how well this game would work for you if it was your first AC-game. I did enjoy it a lot, and the atmosphere of the game is AWESOME. Old Constantinople (modern day Istanbul) has a lot of vibe to it, and looks beautiful. Right now, my favorite setting is Paris in ACU, followed by Constantinople and Rome (ACB)...it's up there.\n\nGreat game, great ending to the Ezio-trilogy AND AC1. If you enjoyed the first two Ezio-games, make sure you get this one.\n\nPros:\n- Great atmosphere/setting\n- Good story/ending to Ezios and Altairs story\n- Some minor improvements to climbing, weapons, assassin guild etc.\n- Great soundtrack\n- Play as Altair\n- Very cool intro\n- Some very cool missions/memories... (wait till you have to prevent an assassination at the palace, with some Italian musicians involved...)\n- Some epic moments and Indiana Jones-like fights (thinking of one of the last battles in which Sofia was involved)\n\nCons:\n- Occasional crashes (YMMV)\n- As usual, kinda problematic controls\n- Might not be a good standalone or "get into the franchise" type game, start with AC or, even better, ACII\n\nAnd... once again, and I am not gonna spoil anything - if you did like Ezio and Altair, you owe yourself (and them) to play this. The ending of their story (for a bit more of Ezio's story, check out the "Embers" movie on YT) is quite touching - yes, it's sad, but to me, it was a satisfying ending to the story of two amazing heroes\n\n9.5/10","October 8, 2015","true","21.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some are for good, some for evil. The setting in Konstantinopel is refreshing, but much after a few hours running through it you do get bored at the rather repetitive environment. You just don't care about learning the map by heart, compared to the experience in Assassin's Creed II & Brotherhood. The minimap is rather limited as you very often pass by points of interest because it is so small.\n\nThe hookblade is one of my favourites. When I encountered it I thought to myself; "why wasn't this in the previous games?". It's uses are many, and it's fun to get creative. The combat system is pretty much the same as always, but it lacks something, something from its prequel. Everything is just too simple. If I'm surrounded by 7 enemies then they should attack me, not stand around waiting for me to kill them one by one. The addition of bombs are really helpful at any given time. Customization is a love-interest of mine, making this great. The bombs seem to reflect the player, and with great accuracy.\n\nThe storyline is very interesting. The story of Ezio is awesome, and Altaïr as well. Desmond is more of a question mark though. His background story is... enlightening, but the "maps" are a bit hard at some points which seems rather strange.   The story does however feel like a dissapointment. It is too short. I know that I play games too much, but this ended rather quickly. And since the gigantic cliffhanger left behind from Brotherhood, Revelations feel like either a sidenote or mistake. The end was very pleasing and somewhat epic in Ezio's story, but I want more. No spoilers, but it felt rather epic when Ezio and Altaïr were together.\n\nTo sum up: the storyline of the game is short, unmotivated, teasing and at some times even infuriating. The inventory of weapons and tools gives you a wide range of possibilities, but together with a dumb AI the entire combat system has become too easy. Still, it gives you the liberty of playing the game the way you want to, as you can use this arsenal either to distract hostiles, kill them, ghost etc. The setting is too big, too repetitive and one-sided. This game may be a must-be in a gamers life, but it is in many ways dissapointing. If I want to powergame anything from the series, it would either be Assassin's Creed II or Brotherhood, not this.\n\nStill, this IS Assassin's Creed. Ezio and Altaïr may grow a full beard, but their skills only get sharper. Nothing is true, everything is permitted.","October 12, 2014","true","18.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's basically ACII AND Brotherhood all over again, but this time there's practically nothing new. Yes, there are bombs (which I hardly used), a hookblade (which was actually pretty good), a parachute (never used it; only for the story) and a tower defense mini-game (which works alright, but doesn't belong in the game if you ask me), but it's just not enough to call this a NEW Assassin's Creed game. They're really milking the franchise.\n\nHowever, the story IS told in a better way and you get to play as both Altair and Ezio. You also get to play as Desmond, obviously, but that's only a matter of minutes, thankfully. Desmond's segments are critical to the story, but it diminishes the gameplay experience. It just pulls you out of the entire experience.\n\nAll in all, you really can't go wrong with AC. Just don't expect too much from it.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","March 16, 2012","true","10.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game expands upon ACB similarly to how ACB expanded upon AC2. That is to say you see a few new things here and there, some unneccesary fat added (that tower defense mini-game is a very unusual addition), but generally you know exactly what you are getting from this if you played the earlier games. The story is a bit weaker, and Constantinople isn't quite as cool as Rome, but it's still at roughly the same level of quality as AC2 and ACB. It's still a good game, but this is less a sequel and more an expansion pack the size of a full game.","November 29, 2013","true","46.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The Den Defense mini-games, a tower-defense style mini-game, are an interesting addition to the various activities you'll find around the city.  I did miss the larger environments and the horses, but honestly, they didn't add much to the game.  The Assassin's Apprentice missions really add more character to the Brotherhood concept that the last game brought to the table, and really serve to make you form a bit of a bond with each of the assassins you recruit, rather than just more fodder for you to throw at guards.  The first-person Desmond missions were boring and repetitive and barely provided any story for the amount of time spent just to unlock them, then by plodding through the yawn-inducing puzzles.  I'd rather they'd expanded on or done something similar to the previous game's modern-day Monteriggioni sequence","December 27, 2011","true","35.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/likeucare/recommended/201870/","likeucare","LIKEUCARE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/likeucare/","1377 products in account","And my revisit continues with the 4th installment of the Assassin's Creed franchise, here comes Revelations!\n\nHaving already played this game on the PS3 at its launch back in 2011, I can say that I had mixed feelings with this game. Many good aspects saved the bad ones for me. Namely, this game feels very much like a "forced-filler". Granted, Ubisoft had their plans for the Ezio Auditore character and I can respect that. But at least, Ubisoft has done a fantastic job for Ezio's conclusion of its trilogy.\n\nSo now Ezio wants to uncover the secrets left in Massyaf library by Altaïr but he can't access it. So he has to go over Constantinople, trying to find the keys left there, on purpose.\n\nPROS:\n+Story takes a while to begin, but contain a really good conclusion for my favorite character, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad.\n+Emotionally fulfilling ending for Ezio Auditore.\n+Soundtrack as good as previous AC games. It is a shame Jesper Kyd won't return for the other AC games.\n+Gameplay mechanic got refined in most areas. Hook-blade is a great new addition so were the bombs crafting.\n+Cities are still great to explore.\n+Solid visuals.\n+Brotherhood recruitment is refined. You now have missions to promote an assassin to a den leader.\n+Multiplayer got much improved, even if I barely played it. I do like the way they're made as a Templar's training grounds.\n\n\nCONS:\n-Uplay DRM. I had trouble activating my Deluxe and DLC contents on Uplay since these addons aren't activatable on Uplay but    IN THE GAME itself. And if you try to activate contents on Uplay often, you get a temporary ban... irritating!\n-Gamebreaking bug met during the 'Setting Sail' mission. Had to restart the game many times.\n-AC formula has grown old. I could feel the AC fatigue in this game.\n-Main story with Desmond Miles in Revelation is the weakest of the AC games.\n-The mini-game for sending your assassins in other cities is quite pointless, especially once they're all high level, this mini-game becomes pointless because the Templars always miraculously reclaim the claimed cities of your assassins.\n-Tower defense mode. Sure they're a new mechanic of the game but not because you make new stuff makes it good.\n-Desmond sections are very bland. First-person puzzling. Boring, too long for so little revelation. You better watch Youtube videos or read AC Wikia instead!\n-Poor pacing. Slow start... very slow progression... then once you reach the near-end sequence, it is a non-stop "end-mission".\n-Very little that's actually new\n-No horseback riding.\n-The Lost Archive DLC is quite pointless. It is an interesting backstory of Subject 16 but you gotta cope with the annoying bland First-person puzzle platformer. Better watch Youtube videos or read AC Wikia instead!\n\nOVERALL:\nSomehow, my least liked AC game of the franchise, so far, since I haven't completed AC 3 and AC 4 yet. But this one feels very much like a flushed out filler, a game that wasn't really needed. The story of Ezio got to end properly and a good service for Ezio's fans. But I could realy feel the AC fatigue in Revelations, especially on the Desmond Miles main story. It was very bland and its First-person puzzle platformer was quite boring. It's not hard, just too long for the few little "secrets" that gets revealed. Just watch Youtube videos or read AC Revelations Wikia instead!\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nIf you had managed to play AC 1 till AC: Brotherhood, yes, you must play AC: Revelations. The conclusion for Altaïr was my main appeal since not only it was well done, but actually made sense with Ezio's story too. If you're a newcomer to the AC franchise, well you're not in the right place to start playing here, with Revelations. You'll feel quite lost on the whole saga. The story is quite important and you either better play the previous games or get informed on the main events of the other games.\n\nRATING:\n7.5 / 10\n\nMaybe someday, we'll be able to play as a Templar, single player speaking? That is my greatest wish for this franchise! Or heck, make another IP and focus on the Templar side of story! I'd love that very much Ubisoft!\n\nAnd now, to continue my AC marathon with AC 3...","June 30, 2014","true","21.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Brotherhood, while short, continued the good parts of AC2 and gave us a bit more story. This game is a pile of ♥♥♥♥ing deceit and lies from Ubisoft. The name of this game makes it sound like the ♥♥♥♥ing final title in the series but instead (like Brotherhood) it is another 50 dollar ♥♥♥♥ing expansion pack that barely advances the story, and adds abunch of stuff to make the game boring and uninteresting.\n\nThis game is literally just MORE OF THE SAME. It is identical to the previous two titles in everything from controls, feel, and graphics and nothing seems to have advanced. Well, I take that back. The graphics have gotten better as it seems they increased the LOD for the PC version, as well as giving us super sharp textures which are not seen on the console version. This is just a guess, but the game is the best looking in the series and definitely looks better than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console version. The graphics are not even the problem with the game as it is still pretty impressive with the size and detail of the cities that is present in this series. The problem is the same reason that Call of Duty sucks ♥♥♥ now. They are running the franchise into the ground by releasing MORE OF THE SAME, especially considering this is the 2nd ♥♥♥♥ing title of AC this year.\n\nSo I don't have much to say about the gameplay as for the most part it is the same stuff that we have seen before. You mainly play as Ezio (with various Altair scenes) where you run, jump, chase, and assassinate targets based upon where the missions send you. The combat is largely the same with all the same weapons and one enemy attacking you at a time, then with the counter and kill system present. It literally controls exactly the same. The problem here is, there is nothing new that this game offers in terms of missions, combat or anything else. It does add more stuff to the game (like bombs, and the worst tower defense mini-game ever), but none of this really adds to the core gameplay and is really just extra side activities to have fun with (or not).\n\nThe first major problem with this turd is that the missions have become incredibly ♥♥♥♥ing boring. They either have you doing the same that you did before in the previous two titles (which was the exact problem with the first ♥♥♥♥ing game, i.e. repetition). The missions are literally just the same thing as either following a target, finding an artifact, etc. There is nothing wrong with this as the core game itself is pretty fun especially if you liked the gameplay from the previous titles, the problem is just because we have ♥♥♥♥ing done this so many times before that it is starting to get stale, the game needs to have new ideas and variety in the missions. Something which we all know Ubisoft sucks ♥♥♥ at.\n\nNow they are also adding in abunch of convoluted ♥♥♥♥ that I don't really give two ♥♥♥♥♥ and a sack of balls about. The first thing is bombs, and crafting bombs. Ezio now can throw bombs and make different types for different purposes. There is nothing wrong with this element. It could have been a solid addition to the game, but the fact is I simply don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about it because the game doesn't make you. It is just another side activity for Ezio to do. The game is getting TOO filled with this ♥♥♥♥. Now you have buying shops, gaining money from the shops, upgrading armor, buying new weapons, repairing armor, collecting animus fragments, recruiting assassins, sending assassins out on missions, burning down towers to unlock areas, capturing guild dens, side quests, Mediterranean defense, and challenges. Now I'm not complaining that there is a lot of content in the game, the problem is none of it ♥♥♥♥ing matters to the main story in ANYWAY in the slightest. Buying shops and upgrading had a purpose to the story in AC2 as you were improving your hub city and helping yourself and your uncle. None of it has any ♥♥♥♥ing meaning in this game and is just there for the sake of being there, and it really makes it uninteresting and too cramped with ♥♥♥♥ that doesn't matter. I'm happy with most of it as it adds some content to the game, the problem is it didn't need any MORE ♥♥♥♥ on top of it, maybe just EVOLVED forms and more interesting forms of what was already there. Now bombs are added on top of this, and worst yet, the single ♥♥♥♥ing WORST tower defense game in the history of games.\n\nThis game has such a terrible tower defense game that it makes my ♥♥♥♥ deflate and shrivel inside of my body. Whoever decided to put this into the game should be hanged in public and peed upon by everyone who purchased this game. After capturing a guild den, they become under conflict and you have to play a tower defense game placing units on the map and blockades to stop the Templar from reaching a certain port. The problem is it is so horrible balanced and utterly boring that it hurts the game rather than helps it. I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about this tower defense ♥♥♥♥ and it needs to go. ♥♥♥♥ you Ubisoft.\n\nSo I have to say just to clarify, the graphics are nice and the game is still the same kind of fun we have had before, just now becoming stale. The problem is, the story doesn't help. Big ♥♥♥♥ing questions were left at the end of AC2 and Brotherhood and they really added a sense to want you to keep playing. The story in this game does not. In fact, this game barely ♥♥♥♥ing advances the story AT ALL. Desmond is now stuck in the Animus for some reason and Ezio is trying to unlock the pieces to some door of Altair. That is it, the story doesn't really evolve beyond this or reveal anything more about the ancient race. All that you find out is that Ezio retires and knows Desmond is watching for some reason (they never explain how) and that some solar flare destroyed Earth and Desmond has to stop a second. A solar flare? That was the big secret? Another point which hurts and does not help the game.\n\nThis game is fallen victim to what I call the Ubisoft Curse (can I trademark that ♥♥♥♥?). AC1 was moderately successful so Ubisoft put more work into and made AC2 which was a great game and it sold well. Now Ubisoft is putting the curse on the franchise and milking it ♥♥♥♥ing dry like they have done with all their series. They milked Splinter Cell, Rainbow Six, and every other ♥♥♥♥ing series with 500 mediocre games that they rushed out the door simply to generate a quick buck. This was their LAST good series that they owned. AC2 was a damn good game, brotherhood continued the trend, but this one has fallen victim to the curse where they simply rushed another title with the AC name on it to make a quick ♥♥♥♥ing buck. It sucks because they are now ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on their last good series and we, the customers, are the ones getting ♥♥♥♥ed up the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because we paid 50 bucks for this. Assassin's Creed 2 felt epic because you traveled all over Italy to multiple cities, and had a hub city from which you operated. It made the game feel large and epic in scale, as well as being the longest game in the series. Brotherhood and Revelations have begun killing this by only containing one city which stabs that feeling right in the back and confines you in a smaller area which is obviously faster to develop so they shove out more titles. The Ubisoft Curse begins.\n\nThe series needs more time between sequels and more innovation as this title does not keep the fun and large scale feeling that AC2 has had and instead feels like a rushed title to make more money of the franchise by offering the exact same ♥♥♥♥ as before with a few new elements thrown on top.\n\n6.5/10","March 10","true","17.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

In that case, you know what to expect from AC: Revelations. Fortunately for us, Ubisoft realized this and is very quick to drop you into the action with minimal opening tutorials and hand holding. This way the game dug its hooks in quick and held me throughout the roughly 30 hours it took to get 100% synchronization.\n\nBoth of the new cities, Constantinople and Cappadocia, are a joy to explore and move through, befitting of the signature feature of the series. In the opening cinematic as you first step into Cappadocia I definitely had a stop and stare “whoa” moment. These cities become more than places but characters in the story that you get to know more of as you play.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, I was pleased with most of the new characters as well as how they handled the old ones, particularly in wrapping up Ezio and Altaïr’s sagas. I would have liked to have seen some of the villains fleshed out more. There were several that we don’t see enough of to avoid feeling like they’re one dimensional characters there just to fulfill a checklist that says a boss fight is needed. The voice acting and Jesper Kyd’s soundtrack are high quality, as usual. The interactions involving Ezio and one of the new characters, Sofia, are among the high points of the writing and acting. I was also pleasantly surprised with the telling of Desmond’s story, despite that portion’s odd gameplay.\n\nThere are some unique features in this game that create a couple minor stumbling points. The most notable is the first person Desmond sections that I just mentioned. I wouldn’t call these a complete failure though. In fact, I expected far worse considering some of what I had heard about them. Some of these areas are visually stunning and the soundtrack caught my ear a couple times. It’s the first person view and simplistic gameplay that drag them down. For whatever reason there is also a tower defense type minigame that isn’t good enough to deserve a place in the game. If you’re careful with your notoriety status in the regular game you shouldn’t have to do this often, I only ever did it twice.\n\nWhile I only spent 2 hours playing multiplayer, I enjoyed the time. It certainly is a different experience and takes a different mindset to play against other people. If deathmatch with a stealth aspect and AC’s fluidity of movement sound appealing to you then I think you’ll enjoy this.","March 3, 2014","true","34.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But apart from AC, which was a horrible game, just a next step after Prince of Persia, I think AC Revelations is the weakest point before the Connor's story. I haven't played Brotherhood yet, but I've heard it's the best in Ezio Trilogy.\n\nDon't get me wrong, ACR is a good game, definitely worth the price. The main story is interesting, the combat is smooth, most missions are fun, there are new weapons and tactics, the narrow streets of Constantinopole are perfect for parkour. But the game experience itself just doesn't feel that fresh anymore. I guess, there's just that many AC games that you can play before the excitement starts to fade.\n\nSo to sum up the pros and cons...\n\nPROS\n\n+ Good main story, but not as good as before or after\n+ You are not forced to play as Desmond, if you don't want to, in order to proceed. It's constant Ezio/ Altair experience\n+ Combat and camera is working perfectly (it was a big problem in previous parts), so you always jump and land, where you want\n+ Narrow streets of Constantinopole are perfect for parkour. You can cross the whole city, without touching the ground. Ziplines are also a nice introduction\n+ Some new useful weapons such as bombs, a crossbow and a hook blade. Parachutes are very useful, too\n\nCONS\n\n- Income problem is still not fixed. You're short of money in the beginning, and you're millionnaire, when you don't need it anymore\n- Only 4 locations (Masyaf, Constantinople, Cappadocia and Maiden Tower)\n- Boring side quests (except for Master assasin missions) and grinding challenges. Ultra-boring Desmond sequences, which are basically about Desmond's memories and block building\n- Kind of short, compared to other parts\n- The game does not introduce all gameplay elements equally well. For example, Mediterranean defense, assasin assignment, assasin promotion, den attack triggers are not explained enough.\n\nI didn't play the MP, but if it's the same as in AC3, I don't even want to try.\n\nMy overall rating 7/10.","April 21, 2015","true","48.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Definitely better than AC3 and Black Flag.","October 1, 2015","true","32.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Overall, this game is better than 3 in a few areas but 3 has better control and combat. But what makes this game so unforgettable and so pleasing to look at is its combination middle eastern/Victorian setting. The graphics are stunning and even more pleasing to look at than AC3. The character models are just as good as both AC3 and 4. The presentation value is astounding and there are a lot more objects and details than there are in AC3. The combination of dulled bright pastels with dusty and sandy overtones give the game a remarkable and unforgettable world. Two things this game does better than AC3: more non-linear in comparison and better presentation (although 3 still looks awesome).\n\nThere are two main reasons why I like this game over 3. Ezio is imo the best main character yet in a AC game, and this game takes place exclusively in a giant city with limitless parkouring opportunities and is heavily populated by people everywhere. It means you have more paths to complete objectives and to move around the game, or at least much more parkouring opportunities. In 3 you are going to spend some time in the wide-open wilderness and even the cities are much more wide-open than this game. I prefer to have this game's giant tightly quartered city at my disposal.\n\nThere are a couple of problems that this game has that I wish it could have done much better on. The controls are not as tight as thery are in later games, but they are close because AC controls are sometimes hit and miss. Sometimes you will parkour onto things you did not want to, and sometimes you will jump to or down from places that you did not want to. Combat however is smooth and easy. The other problem is optimization. It is no surprise and is a common issue with all of Ubisoft's games because they are, far and away, the all-time undisputed kings of bad console ports. Their ports are so bad that I stopped buying their games years ago. I have kept following their progress though and they are still making horrible ports. They will probably never learn. Anyway, the problem with this game is that while it runs at a smooth 60fps, there is constant stutter-locking, common in a lot of bad Ubisoft ports.\n\nDespite the flaws this is one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen, even despite its age.\n\nGame 8.5/10, Port job: 5/10 Go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves Ubisoft. Every game you port has p1ss poor performance issues lol.","November 2, 2014","true","21.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

One thing I really liked is the hook-and-run, which allowed you to get past a bunch of guards making a roadblock.  This game also introduced the den defense minigame, which I wasn't very fond of.  I want to freerun and assassinate people, not play a tower-defense game...  One more thing they added was bomb crafting, which I never used ever...

It featured some flashbacks to Altair, the original assassin, but didn't really explain much about the Templar/Assassin war, their philosophies, or just what's going on in the modern world.\n\nIt did reveal how depressing Altair's life was. Pretty much his entire family gets killed. He gets disgraced and kicked out of the Assassin's Guild, his son gets killed, his wife gets killed when they go to redeem their dead son, then more people get killed. Everybody goes and dies until eventually Altair himself sits down in a chair to rest and dies. But those are just the flashbacks.\nThe actual storyline is not memorable.\n\nGameplay is very similar to previous games. You have the same 4 groups of allies; assassins, thieves, warriors, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. You try to burn enemy outposts and renovate shops in the area. The only difference is the location, which is set in Istanbul/Constantinople.\n\nVisually, the game looks nice. It's sharp, crisp, with good character details and animations.\n\nMusic is beautiful. The main theme is catchy. Voice acting is above-average.\n\nOverall, It's a nice game in the style of AC2 and AC:Brotherhood, set in a different town, cast in a gloomier tone. By the end of the game, you feel like an old man waiting to die, without really knowing the answers to your life's questions.\n\nRating: 6/10.","December 2, 2013","true","22.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Istanbul is not even fun to explore like Firenze or Venezia (yeah) Because while the European setting of the first two games is quite colorful, Constantinople is in sepia tone and full of mosques and such. Maybe I don't find it interesting because it's my everday scenery but there is a problem in color grading of the game. It just makes it boring. Istanbul is still beautiful  in the game but...\n\nAnd they didn't even use much of a music to support the atmosphere. The ones you hear (except one or two when you hear during cutscenes) are just backgroung chorus that you shut your ears later in the game. Maybe they tried to avoid being oriental with the east theme but it didn't work good for them.\n\nStill there's the good old Assassin's Creed feel when you walk the streets, pass people in their everyday walkabouts, run on roofs and climb fast to incredible hights for the view of the beautifuly modeled city.\n\nAnd if you just focus on the scenario it's just like the headline says. There are "revelations" and boy are they exciting as hell. Some nice diologs, a couple of loveable characters, really important pieces about the past and the future. And toward the end it would become really emotional. If you finish the meta-game crap early in the game (you don't need to do that more than one or two times though) like I do, you can enjoy the awesome scenario till the end (like I enjoy) hopefully. Now I just need a discount for the 3rd game.","April 18, 2015","true","42.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Den defense is forced and is required way too frequently until you build up your assasin's enough and then it just disappears altogether.  Mediterranean defense required WAY too much attention to maintain a hold on a region.  It became way too distracting especially for a "completionist" like me.\n\nIf it weren't for previous entries this would be an excellent game in and of itself and definitely worth recommending.  If you've played previous entries you know what you're in store for.\n\nI haven't spent any time on multiplayer but I imagine it's as fun as Brotherhood.

Maintaining the banks and shop management, adding to this there is a notoriety consequence that calls Templar attention.\n\nThe time period is very well portrayed, the city is beautiful and filled with monuments and landmarks like the Hagia Sophia, this does wonders for the game’s immersion. It was also a refreshing change of pace from the Italian cities, combined with the great soundtrack; it truly is great to play a game like this.\n\nI could not recommend this game enough, it quickly became my favorite of the trilogy, the portrayal of the city, its people and history is amazing, combined with good missions with interesting characters.

I think it definitely helps with your enjoyment of this game to play it right after beating the AC:B because it helps you appreciate the imrpovements and differences.\n\nCombat is improved with the addition of stronger enemies that can't be insta-killed. It encourages you to make more use of your various tools and stealth, which enhances the variety of the gameplay.\n\nThe long climbing / free-running segments in AC:B could feel like a boring slog at times. They've dramatically improved that in this game - any sections that have an emphasis on free-running and climbing have an engaging, well-designed "flow" to them that was lacking in the previous games. The addition of the hook blade makes climbing more engaging because you can go faster if you use the hook correctly, and it allows the levels to give you more of a sense of speed and traversal because of things like zip lines and long jumps. Overall, these sections have gone from being a dreadfully boring thing that you just have to force yourself through to a very fun and exciting bit of gameplay.\n\nThe setting in AC:B was starting to get stale after being so similar to AC2. Things like the voice clips, ambience, architecture, and stuff like that just started to make the game feel a little bit too familiar. They've addressed this by bringing you to a whole new, unique location in this game. It seems like a small difference, but it really is a great relief to not be hearing the same random voice clips from the guards and citizens as they react to you.\n\nThe only spots where I didn't enjoy the game involved having to re-do certain long sections during missions when I failed or when a bug caused me to fail, and the tower-defence like mode where you have to defend your captured strongholds. In such a huge game as this, random bugs are an inevitability. Thankfully, the checkpointing system is usually quite forgiving (or at least I got lucky), so you only have the occasional frustrating moment, but there were a few sections where I had failed right before a checkpoint and had to replay 5 minutes or so. That's just not very fun when those 5 minutes are pretty much the same every time. There's really only a few missions that have the capacity to be frustrating, though. As for the tower-defense, it's just not fun. I frequently found that, while I could successfully and easily hold back all of the waves, I lost right at the end when the siege unit comes through. When that happens, you may find yourself in a situation where you don't have money for more units so you just have to sit there watching the siege unit plunk away at your base until you die. I think that you're supposed to disband the units that the siege engine has already passed and re-assign them to be near your base, but I ended up not getting a chance to try this out. Anyway, I don't come to this game for tower-defence, so it's kind of an annoying interruption. You can avoid it in several ways, thankfully, so as long as you put a little bit of effort towards that end, you won't have to deal with tower defence.\n\nThere's plenty of other things that I won't go into that adds to the appeal of this game.\n\nOverall, I think it's more fun than AC:B because they had time to see what people thought about AC:B and improve upon it.","September 26, 2015","true","14.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Istanbul is not even fun to explore like Firenze or Venezia (yeah) Because while the European setting of the first two games is quite colorful, Constantinople is in sepia tone and full of mosques and such. Maybe I don't find it interesting because it's my everday scenery but there is a problem in color grading of the game. It just makes it boring. Istanbul is still beautiful  in the game but...\n\nAnd they didn't even use much of a music to support the atmosphere. The ones you hear (except one or two when you hear during cutscenes) are just backgroung chorus that you shut your ears later in the game. Maybe they tried to avoid being oriental with the east theme but it didn't work good for them.\n\nStill there's the good old Assassin's Creed feel when you walk the streets, pass people in their everyday walkabouts, run on roofs and climb fast to incredible hights for the view of the beautifuly modeled city.\n\nAnd if you just focus on the scenario it's just like the headline says. There are "revelations" and boy are they exciting as hell. Some nice diologs, a couple of loveable characters, really important pieces about the past and the future. And toward the end it would become really emotional. If you finish the meta-game crap early in the game (you don't need to do that more than one or two times though) like I do, you can enjoy the awesome scenario till the end (like I enjoy) hopefully. Now I just need a discount for the 3rd game.","April 18, 2015","true","42.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Den defense is forced and is required way too frequently until you build up your assasin's enough and then it just disappears altogether.  Mediterranean defense required WAY too much attention to maintain a hold on a region.  It became way too distracting especially for a "completionist" like me.\n\nIf it weren't for previous entries this would be an excellent game in and of itself and definitely worth recommending.  If you've played previous entries you know what you're in store for.\n\nI haven't spent any time on multiplayer but I imagine it's as fun as Brotherhood.

It was more alive, than Rome and other italian places, in my opinion. The engine seemed to be updated, I saw some beautiful light effects and the enviroment was more detailed. I recommend you turning off music and just walking around on the streets listening to your surroundings. Whole new game, isn't it?\nThis series always represented a different world view and lots of hidden messages throughout the story. That is that drove me to play the game more and more, I found it really exciting. Sadly the gameplay can be repetitive sometimes, and even frustrating when you're too far away from a fast travel point, but close enough to your target location, so you have to run across the city. 'cause no horses in Constantinapole are allowed...\n\nEven though its small mistakes, this series is a must-play for all gamers out there, I'm looking forward to the next episodes.\n","September 5, 2015","true","16.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Bombs offer tons of tactical and offensive options. The Hookblade speeds up climbing without being too powerful.

The completist in me really wanted to see the Ezio trilogy to the end, but I just couldn't because 'Assassin's Creed Revelations' just didn't improve on 'Brotherhood' enough and add more value to the previous games to make it really worthwhile.\n\nThe graphics in 'Revalations' are gorgeous (even by 2013 -- 2014 standards) and I love Constantinople as the setting, but the whole game felt sluggish -- like the aging Ezio ironically. When I found out that in this game, Ezio tasked himself on another hunting quest, I thought, "Again?" The freshness of Ezio's adventures was gone and the Ubisoft team should have stopped while Ezio was still on top. Adding new weapons to your arsenal was not enough to keep me interested, and I actually found myself dreading the need to invest in city businesses and to train assassins all over again.\n\nThe pacing of the game was off-putting as well, with the Den Defense minigame to be most annoying. Similar minigames were found in games like 'Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas' -- it wasn't fun then, and it isn't fun now (or ever). Plus, Den Defense was not what I want to do when I play an 'Assassin's Creed' game.\n\nUnless you're truly invested in Ezio's adventures, don't bother with 'Revelations'.

To its credit, Assassin's Creed: Revelations is better than Brotherhood and is pretty much the sequel Brotherhood was meant to be. Although whereas Brotherhood was an unimaginative rehash of previous gameplay principles, Revelations appears to be this dubious mishmash of poorly implemented game ideas.\n\nThere's less filler missions but now you individually rescue about a hundred citizens to induct into your assassin ranks. They removed the cryptography puzzles (a shame since I honestly enjoy cryptography) and inserted first-person PLATFORMERS into the metagame sequences instead. There's this odd TOWER DEFENSE mini-game, and it's presented both as a fail condition from being too notorious yet comes with rewards of its own. The Awareness Icon can go blow itself: even at max notoriety, Ottoman soldiers won't challenge you unless you're already doing something suspicious and Byzantine soldiers always view you as an enemy anyhow. Finally, challenges are back and in greater number than ever. They were probably intended as a tutorial device but the sheer quantity of tasks required grinds the story to a halt.\n\nA major sticking point for Revelations is how utterly unbalanced it is. I was used to unbalanced mechanics from when one could simply wait for money to fall from the sky and open up better equipment toot sweet. That's still there but now you have the main map open from the get-go and access to END LEVEL EQUIPMENT as soon as you unlock your towers and complete your assassin network. Master Assassin armor and 5/5/5 weapons by sequence three? You better believe it. Bomb crafting seems to be the major drawing point of this installment and they're both easily accessible and eminently customizable. Sadly, simple smoke bombs were already overpowered by Assassin's Creed 2  and have now become superfluous by the sheer amount of killing tools you possess. Furthermore, they can only be crafted at specific crafting stations, meaning you won't be able to switch to the right bomb in the middle of a mission when they'd be relevant.\n\nI really wanted to give Assassin's Creed: Revelations my thumbs up; it's essentially a Michael Bay movie set up in Turkish gunpowder civilization. But as much as I enjoy the stunts you pull throughout the story, there is no defense for the clunky gameplay mechanics. I imagine one could say the same for the series as a whole.","December 12, 2015","false","44.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

This part of the series did not do it for me. The storyline is very good to be honest. I really liked travelling to Constantinopel and see how things were in the time of the Ottoman empire. The Ezio send-off at the end is worth it and makes way for part III. But the rest of the game felt tedious and boring. I even stopped playing for a while. I had to 'force' myself to continue playing to see how the story would unfold.\n\nThe bomb system just didn't add anything special to the fighting mechanics and you can easily play the whole game without ever using a bomb.\nI am usually an achievement and stats horder, but this time I just couldn't be bothered.\nThe number of different fighting styles from enemies could have been cool too, but it didn't add excitement to the game. It brought frustration to the game, which is a shame, because it really could have been cool. The fact is that every enemy has a single strategy to defeat them and that's it.\nThe 'Tower Defense'  minigame doesn't add anything to the game in my opinion and the fact that you had to send your assassins to other cities just felt stupid and worthless. Why would you send them to cities where you don't play yourself? Could easily have worked in the main city (divided in districts where you really have to fight to gain control and keep control). Now it just feels like something that happens way over there and doesn't effect you very much.\nThe shop-ownership system feels like a waste of time too. AC II, where you re-build your mansion and small town around it, felt way more satisfactory in my opinion.\n\nIn conclusion: if this game is on major sale and you want to see the story progress, do get it and play through it, but otherwise... stay away from this title, read online how the story unfolds (or watch the split scenes on youtube or something) and move on to AC III.","September 12, 2015","false","35.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/201870/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","Assassin’s Creed Revelations is a third person parkour/stealth game, and the third in the Assassin’s Creed II trilogy of games. While on the surface this game may seem similar to – indeed, even improved from its predecessors, the game suffers from a weak plot and repetitive gameplay relative to the previous games.\n\nStory\n\nEzio Auditore is graying, but he hasn’t slowed down yet. After travelling to the fortress of Altair, the assassin protagonist from the original Assassin’s Creed, in search of answers, he is confronted by a group of Templars who are searching for five keys that could open up Altair’s vault and give them access to the Apple of Eden, an ancient artifact left behind by Those Who Came Before that can reveal many secrets and control men’s minds, among other things. Ezio must find the keys before them so that he can keep the artifact safe.\nAlas, this game’s plot is quite poor compared to the previous games; the plot is motivated entirely by a “collect the soup cans” plot, where you try and collect the magical keys before the bad guys do. The cast is all new, with only Ezio appearing from the previous two Assassin’s Creed II games, and while there are flashbacks to Altair’s life in the aftermath of the original Assassin’s Creed, having never played the first game, I’m not sure to what extent some of the characters are carried over from that game.\nThe biggest problem lies in the fact that the modern-day plot – the entire reason that Desmond, the protagonist, is flashing back through his ancestor’s memories – takes an extreme back seat throughout the game. Desmond spends the entire game trapped in the machine that allows him to view his ancestor’s memories, and thus the meta-plot comes to a screeching halt and the whole game feels like a pointless cash-in, something which Ubisoft created to exploit AC II once more before finally releasing AC III. While the meta-plot never consumed a huge fraction of the previous games, its absence here is very notciable, as Ezio’s story just isn’t that interesting or high-stakes, and none of the characters I encountered in Constantinople connected with me in any way. The whole “conspiracy theory” angle that the previous games had is almost entirely lost, with no real signs of said gigantic conspiracy appearing in the game, and without that whole aspect, the game is simply much less interesting.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay is virtually unchanged from the previous Assassin’s Creed II games. Ezio starts out with all his toys, and he only really gets a couple new ones – a hook that he can use to extend his reach while jumping, which is vaguely interesting for some platforming, and bombs, which have a variety of effects, but the main one is basically “win fights even more ridiculously easily than before.” There were a few acrobatic maneuvers added to close combat, but they’re mostly pretty worthless; combat is extremely easy and I never even once had to use the new maneuvers to win or escape.\nThe gameplay is still the same formula as the previous Assassin’s Creed II games: you spend the whole game running through a city, climbing buildings and occasionally murdering people. The parkour is pretty smooth, but honestly has begun to wear a bit thin; while it is neat being able to climb buildings, in the end it is mostly just following paths through the environment which mostly feel extremely straightforward and without much skill. Because Ezio does so much automatically, there’s very little challenge in the platforming aspects of the game, and because Ezio is so good at instantly killing enemies – indeed, he can kill every enemy in the game with a single hit, and oftentimes, kill entire groups in this manner – there’s very little challenge in combat. The main challenge of the game is sneaking around stealthily, and a few missions where you aren’t supposed to kill people, but even all of that is easily done within a couple tries.\nConsequently, the game as a whole feels extremely lightweight, and there isn’t much of a sense of achievement in victory; everything feels like it was handed to you on a silver platter, and the lack of challenge makes a lot of the game feel samey. A few underground tombs add some variety to the feel of the game, and a few of them felt pretty good, but in the end they really more or less boil down to “running along the path and the game trying to make it look impressive”, rather similar to the 3D Sonic games, but without the challenge. The missions can almost all be beaten very quickly, and most of the missions that cannot be beaten extremely quickly are because you have to run back and forth across the city. If you were just running through the main quest line, you could beat the entire game in under 10 hours.\nThe main side quests in the game are just “collect all the objects in the environment”, and while there are maps to finding the items which you can purchase, actually grabbing all the items is completely unchallenging; it is just tedious. Indeed, almost all of the “challenges” in the game are just tedious time-wasters to make the game feel longer than it really is; there’s only a handful of sidequests, and of them, only two had any real weight to them, and both of them were additional “Explore the ancient tomb” type challenges, much like the ones in the main questline, except in different environments.\nAs in the previous Assassin’s Creed game, you can recruit a bunch of sidekick assassins and send them on quests to go murder people to level up, or you can have them stick around and murder people for you while you’re going around town, which makes the game even more of a joke. In the end, these sidequests are handled entirely textually and are very dull, just another time management/time waster that the game throws in to make things last longer.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe game looks decent enough graphically; the graphics are nothing to write home about, but they are serviceable enough and the primary characters are all reasonably distinctive. Alas, your sidekick assassins are entirely interchangeable and not terribly interesting looking, and the city itself, while pretty enough at first, quickly becomes a bland backdrop after running across it for the umpteenth time. The hidden assassin key locations break up the monotony a bit, but for most of the game, you see nothing but a bunch of samey buildings.\n\nFinal Summary\n\nAssassin’s Creed Revelations is a cash-in on the Assassins’s Creed II series of games, and is pretty much entirely worthless; the game does nothing to further the meta-story of the series, and Ezio’s story here is pretty bland. The gameplay is just more of the same from the previous games, with more of the same tedious time wasters to pretend like the game is longer than it is. There’s just not a whole lot here to recommend; it is yet another ACII game, but despite the slight improvements in gameplay it is worth neither your time nor your money.\n","August 28, 2015","false","34.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

A convoluted story that at times makes little sense and has you doing farmville type activities to try to bulk out the game. The writing is pretty awful. The first AC game was really interesting but as soon as they revealed this whole templars thing I think it fell flat with players. The animus is lot more interesting than Brotherhood though.\n\nGameplay: Almost entirely unchanged, the game mechanics are so similar that you're spending most of your time bored here. There is a lot of bloat here that is best skipped. If you want to recruit other assassin's or earn money instead of playing the game that's great. I hated the whole direction. Altair is back but it might as well be cutscenes.\n\nGraphics: The graphics appear to be an updated theme in an old engine but the bugs are really out in force.\n\nBugs: 4 years on and this game is still heavily bugged. During this game it crashed multiple times requiring CPU affinity to be set to a single core crippling performance. Other bugs include falling into areas that end with you stuck, camera issues that make the game unplayable and a QTE boss fight event doesn't accept the key strokes required, leading to a restart. Focus on stealth is sadly lacking and you can't restore to a checkpoint if you are discovered, you have to restart the entire memory or suicide.\n\nIt's unlikely I'll put any time into another AC game without stunning reviews.","June 18, 2015","false","11.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

I was really looking forward to playing the Assassin's Creeds that I missed (Revelations and AC3) but was really disappointed to find that at a certain point in the game, it stopped working. I was playing as Altiar escaping Masyaf or whatever and it crashes with this error message "ACRSP.exe has stopped working". I have a pretty decent gaming computer so I was confused. I launched the game again and played for about 30 seconds before the error message came up again. I tried launching again... and it crashes again. I look online for a solution and apparently it is a problem that alot of people have with this game. After hours of searching and using a cavalcade of different fixes, nothing worked. I have tried my hardest to ask Ubisoft what the problem is but they send me some generic "update your drivers" nonsense. Even after I tried the obvious solution of updating every single GD thing on my computer, it still did not work. Well, I have looked on forums to see if people who had this problem have found a solution and the only thing I keep reading is that Ubisoft are "C***s". So yeah, GG Ubisoft on your quality control and superb customer service. I hope to god Unity will not be as unstable as this game. If there is a god, I beg of you to keep Unity under control.","October 20, 2014","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Но вот этих самых откровений мы от игры не ждали вовсе. Слишком противоречивым казался список новоявленных особенностей: бомбы, старый Эцио, Дезмонд в полной $#*&. Конечно, хотелось верить, что все внимание на себя перетянут ответы на вопросы, которые не дают нам покоя вот уже несколько лет. Нужно было узнать, как закончил свою жизнь Альтаир, герой первой части. Определенные надежды возлагались на красивое завершение истории главного героя сиквела и Brotherhood. Нам Revelations представлялась финальным аккордом великой ассасинской эпопеи, эдакой зачисткой плацдарма перед явлением полноценной третьей части. Ну, не то чтобы мы остались с носом и не получили важных ответов, но красивой развязки так и не случилось; свеженькая Revelations действительно оказалась, в общем-то, «старой песней», но только уже с бомбами и крюком. Что до ассасинского дела, разборок семей и паркура, то до них вам совершенно не будет никакого дела. Эцио на протяжении всей игры занимается только тем, что мы уже видели в прошлый раз.\nAssassin’s Creed: Revelations не вызовет у вас новых эмоций. А старые, наоборот, притупит. Потому что идеи оригинала — и мы не устанем это повторять — беспечно преданы забвению. Получили ли мы все ответы на давно возникшие вопросы? Кажется, да. Но изначально процесс раскрытия основных сюжетных тайн нам представлялся менее растянутым и нудным. В конце концов последнюю часть приключений ассасина как-то не хочется воспринимать как полноценную игру. Основную порцию контента можно было уместить в Brotherhood. Согласитесь, только мыльных опер про средневековых убийц нам не хватало.\nПлюсы: основные вопросы в сюжете наконец-то получили ответы; улучшенный мультиплеер; по-прежнему красиво поставленные бои.\nМинусы: бомбы оказались невостребованными; процесс захвата и обороны кусочков территории Константинополя утомляет; малое количество полезных нововведений; полновесная третья часть так и просится — но разработчики неумолимы.","July 21, 2013","true","10.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Not too much to say about it, same old with a few tweaks.\n- Solid story and interesting NPCs help make some proved mechanics still fun to play.

I spent hours just watching the cities and landmarks, enjoying the cutscenes like a movie. Revelations had some big shoes to fill and I\n\nwasn t dissapointed.\n\n\nPROS\n- Istambul is as beautiful as Firenze, Rome or Venice, but in its own way so it does not get old.\n- Gameplay is already very proved and polished. Not too much to say about it, same old with a few tweaks.\n- Solid story and interesting NPCs help make some proved mechanics still fun to play. Even sidequests usually are connected with the main story. Ezzio is getting old. He\n\ngets tired, his back hurts and the young ladies don´t pay him the attention they used to. But even that is something he does with charm.\n- Tower Defense minigames are fun to play, but dont happen often (finished the game with two)\n\nCONS\n- A few too many weapons and tools that aren´t really useful: The crossbow made the knives obsolete; crafting bombs can be fun, but make no real difference; no real use for parachutes, handgun or poison.\n- Desmond missions are not fun at all.","December 28, 2014","true","41.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But, it concluded the game just perfectly (along with Embers it concludes Ezio’s story – from birth to death – what game character can boast such attention to his life?)\nSo, everything good that was improved compared to the previous game(s):Bombs actually add more fun, the only bad thing is that because of them they had to change the puppeteering controls, which can be confusing a little bit. Several bombs are useful, but some of them were added just for the sake of having more possible variants. I do not get blood, skunk and money bomb. Used them only for completing challenges.\nRemembering Ezio’s words from the corresponding book, hookblade is exactly what he needed. It really helps traversing the city faster. Of course, it is unrealistic, but please... we are talking about the game where you land in a haystack.\nMediterranean defence system was a major improvement from the previous part – adding the possibility of installing bureaus in occupied cities.\nMultiplayer got my favourite feature – Deathmatch. Nearly 95% of my playtime is played on small maps. But, there is also a degradation point – now all the characters have the same weapons, no more unique ones. It is axe, sword, mace, etc. Not like previous game (razor, prosthetic claw, compass, etc.). At least, in high profile they have unique animations.\nWhat I definitely didn’t like is that challenges didn’t change a bit since Brotherhood.

The good bits are an exact carbon copy of Brotherhood set in a slightly different but samey city. The few added mechanics are not worth it, sure now you can customize your own smoke poison bombs in a game that already has like 150 ways and weapons to kill things.\n\nThe bad additions are a crappy tower defense mode which is just not fun, but fittingly the game treats it as a punishment. "Hey, you've done too many bad things, now go and endure this horrible chore!" The previous conspiracy puzzle bits have been replaced by annoying first-person puzzle platformer sections that try to be Portal but fail. They reward you with bits of Desmond mumbling throwaway facts about his childhood, yaay.\n\nThe plot isn't meaningful at all, nothing really happens and I'm fairly sure you can just skip this game completely and none of the events will even be mentioned in the next one. There are some okayish flashbacks about Altaïr's time but if you're one of the few who are interested in the silly overarching plot (I am) just check them on Youtube and save like 15 hours of tedium.\n\nIf for some reason after spending 60+ hours in the previous titles and having 100% completed them you are still not fed up with Ezio, sure, maybe then you can grab this one to do all of it again. Most people should really not bother. This would've been okay as an added DLC to Brotherhood that lasts a maximum of 5 hours, not a full game.","March 4, 2014","false","18.2"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","0"

Like AC: Brotherhood, this was Ubisoft's quick cash-in before AC3.\n\nPros:\n+Same old AC\n+Combat is brutal and thoroughly enjoyable\n+Bomb crafting\n+Multiplayer is always fun!\n+Brings (some sort of) closure on Ezio's and Altair's story\n+Beautiful and gorgeous city of Galata\n+Plenty of collectables to keep you playing for a few more hours\n\nCons:\n-Same old AC\n-The story....the ending sets up the story for AC3 but its ridiculous.\n-Ezio's story comes to an abrupt end and doesn't really feel like they finished anything unlike Atair's story where you find how he ended up.\n-The same bugs that have been plaguing the series are STILL here! Ezio will jump to his death or enemies will spawn right in front of you for cheap deaths.\n-Combat feels repetitive with no real depth. The kills aren't all that different for each weapon either.\n-The best part of the game is when you go to find the Masyaf keys in the crypts BUT there are only 5. That's way too few compared to AC: Brotherhood.\n-Desmond's Journey side missions are so boring. It's a nice puzzle mission but it is way too simple.\n\nMy overall opinion: While this is a decent addition to the franchise, this game was an obvious attempt to milk money out of loyal fans. You can go into AC3 skipping both Brotherhood and Revelations as both aren't important to the story. If you wanted more AC and want to try this out then go ahead. Just don't expect the next best thing. I give this game 7 Masyaf Keys out of 10.","October 23, 2014","false","15.1"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

It is clear that the developers are out of ideas and have no idea how to progress the series foward after switching to the CoD style yearly release.\n\nWhereas in the previous games, Brotherhood, factions such as the mercenaries or thieves would have multiple side quest missions with their own rewards, Revelations only has 1 mission for the mercenaries and the Romani.\n\nThe story itself lacks any clear enemy in your search for 5 keys that contains a diary from Altair, and the main quest line (really, the only quest line) can be completed within 20 hours. There are insights to what happens to Altair after the first game but it's better to save your money and look up spoilers of the game than to play through this snoozer.","March 12, 2012","false","46.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

This game has some major advantages: the combat system is intact, additionally you get the (absolutely amazing) hook blade and bomb making system. Some characters are very interesting, like Prince Suleiman and Sofia. Music is brilliant, especially the main AC Theme that plays in the main menu. Also, Istanbul and Cappadocia are marvelous locations and are fun to explore. Unfortunately, the drawbacks are probably too big. Storyline starts interesting, but then gets very predictible and not very... revealing. And if you like Altair, then you would probably not like scenes with him and ending at all. The whole ending sequence is just very dull and unimaginative. The whole game just feels like it was built on something great, but actually managed to turn it into something boring. Also, just a warning: Ezio's face looks very very very old and Desmond's face looks nothing like Desmond. I also played AC3 and I must say, both those games have issues with faces, which just look very altered and unfamiliar. In the end, though the game has some great points, I would not recommend playing it, nor AC3 and not even AC4. If you really love this franchise, like I do, and not have a major let-down, I would strongly suggest to finish it with AC:Brotherhood.","February 8, 2014","false","29.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Aside for few small differences it is same as Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed 2... It is really good, I like Assassin's Creed, it makes you look powerful and badass... The city itself is beautifully designed and atmosphere is fantastic...\nCombat is usually too easy, as you might expect, but can also be frustrating against tougher opponents that dodge your every move... But, as I said, something you might expect from AssCreed game...\nEverything said, gameplay is great... If you like other games in the series, you'll like this one...\n\nSo, why the "NOT RECOMMENDED"...\n\nFirst, I KNOW that it is a somewhat "fantasy" game, I KNOW that it is "made by people of various religions and beliefs", I KNOW that it is just the game... But, as stated numerous times on the interwebz, people like it, people play it, and people learn about historical figures and facts from it...\n\nhttp://www.debate.org/opinions/does-assassins-creed-teach-some-history\nhttp://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/assassins-creed-history-teacher.jpg\n\nSo, we clarified that; This game... It insults common sense with its "historical" story... And not only that, it also straight forward writes false historical facts (e.g. in database you can read that Constantine the Great forced Christianity on the citizens of the Empire... Why would he do that?! He, himself was not a Christian for almost his entire life... He was baptized on his death bed...). It is just an example, many facts, not important for the story (such as one, written above), were absolutely wrong... Why?! So the Christians would look bad? And Ottomans would look like nice guys, liberating the good people of the Empire... Byzantine empire (also, Roman empire, not Byzantine... The term Byzantine Empire was not used in it's period, neither was it used during the time the game takes place, but it is not important mistake) was multiethnic, and somewhat multicultural empire where barbaric peasant boys grew up to become Emperors... Through ambition and bloody struggle... So, you are telling me about racism and hate for other ethnicities and races in it... And all that, before Ottomans came, liberated the city and allowed everyone to live in it, happy and free... It is absolutely preposterous... And insulting... Especially for Greeks... Every Greek I met so far in the game is bad guy... They are all Byzantines... And, yes, I know they are templars, but they are frequently called Byzantines... More frequently than Templars, actually... And the game openly speaks very bad about Constantine XI, who is national hero in Greece, and saint for some Orthodox christians...\n\nAnd, as you can see, I played a game for few hours... And I plan on finishing it... So, lets see the story to the end... But I am not planning on recommending a game where Palaiologos are main antagonists in fight against the Ottomans...\n\nΣταυρὲ βασιλέως βασιλέων βασιλεῖ βοήθει\n\nYeah, thanks for reading...","August 12, 2014","false","11.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Even worse Brotherhood ends in a major cliffhanger which is promptly mentioned sometime in the beginning for a minute and promptly ignored for the rest of the game.

Of course it's nice to see an ending to Ezio's story, but I seriously think they should've done that with the end of AC Brotherhood, or perhaps even AC II.\n\nAlthough, If you feel that you really need to experience the ending of Ezio's saga, then I'd say it's probably worth it, but in terms of exploring an entirely new game, you will most likely be somewhat disappointed.\n\nConstantinople is an atmospheric city, but joined by a less compelling story, and almost no change in game mechanics from previous titles whatsoever, (besides the obvious "hook blade" and the addition of bombs, which both seem as a very cheap way of avoiding to add new content), this particular game certainly doesn't live up to the standard I've come to expect from Assassin's Creed games. Besides all that, which is probably the most accurate way to describe the game, I personally liked it, but I'm also a stupid fanboy.\n\nHey, maybe that's what you get when you try to push out a new title every year with no exception, Assassin's Creed: Unity sure showed us that, perhaps not creatively, but surely in a techical matter.\n\nOh yeah, and Uplay isn't exactly anything to cheer about either.

I played Brotherhood and AC2 and those were some of the most fun I've ever had in a video game. This continues the trend; parkour, thrilling swordfights, a dashing Italian protagonist: What more could you ask for?\n\nWell.\nThe reason I'm giving this a downvote, and the reason I deleted it from my hard drive, is because the game will not run unless you create an account on Ubisoft's own app, Uplay.\n\nAside from the fact that Uplay has so far proven to be clunky, buggy, and unappealing, I resent on general principle having to register AGAIN to prove ownership of a game I have ALREADY LEGALLY PURCHASED from Steam. In the age of ever-increasing piracy, companies can either place trust in their user base or not, treat them like customers or potential criminals. Ubisoft seems to prefer to treat players as potential pirates, and insists that I place this useless bloatware on my computer.\n\nSo if you really want to play Assassin's Creed: Revelations, go ahead; it's a great game and it might well be worth it to play all the way through. I wouldn't know. I unfortunately also bought other Assassin's Creed titles during the same Steam sale where I purchased this one--however, I will not be buying another one, and I will urge others to do the same.

Assassin's Creed II was a great game that fixed everything that was wrong with the first episode. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood was ACII +. Now, what is AC: Revelations?\n\nFirst and foremost, it's the conclusion of Ezio's personnal adventures. I guess it is a matter of opinion, but 50-something Ezio neither has the charisma nor the appeal of the young italian annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ he used to be. Oh, to be sure, he still slices and hammers moronic templars guards like there's no tomorrow. He stops a conspiracy that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever (what happened to the whole "the Templars work for a precise objective" from AC I?). But he's old, and feels old.\n\nThat's probably also because the game feels old too: there's really nothing exciting in ACR. Sure, Constantinople is a nice city (though it's got nothing over Rome, in my humble opinion), but that's pretty much the only positive thing about ACR.\nThe new gimmicks are either tedious (mediterranean defense is a more annoying version of ACB missions that requires you to spend dozens of minutes dispatching assassins to cities in Europe) or boring as hell (who came up with that tower defense idea? really?).\n\nPrevious episodes tried to build upon Assassin's Creed's original foundations, and kept improving the game. ACR does no such thing. It's just a less-successful reskin of ACB. I haven't played the later AC games, but I suspect ACR is when Ubisoft got lazy, and decided their game was good enough to milk fans of the series once a year.","December 9, 2014","false","42.4"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","10","23","3","6"

The gameplay is essentially the same as "Brotherhood," except for a few mini-games here or there which seem more like diversions than anything meaty (the new tower defense game is especially half-baked).  It's nice to see the conclusions to Altair's and Ezio's stories, I guess, but I was never that attached to them in the first place and the new plotlines involving political intrigue in Constantinople really aren't that interesting.  What's left, I guess, are the promised "revelations," which are nil and mostly just reiterate stuff we already know about the game's silly, convoluted, sci-fi/templar/apocalyptic mythology.\n\nSo why do I keep playing these games if I obviously complain them so much?  I don't know, honestly, as it's certainly not the plot.  I think the core game element of free-running through beautifully designed historic cities is novel enough that it keeps me coming back.  It's like causing havoc in a digital museum.  Plus, I don't think it's pointed out enough, but these games have unusually gorgeous costume design for a video game.  I could just wander around staring at the clothes extras are wearing for hours.\n\nHonestly, though, you could probably skip both "Brotherhood" and "Revelations" and not miss much.

The ending is crap (if you actually buy this nonsense be prepared for something similar to the end of assassins creed 2). The worst part of the game to me was the 5 gates where you could get to see desmonds past. Utter crap. Really boring, really badly told. This has got to be the smallest city they've ever made, too. It's rediculously small. You spend most of the time as Ezio, by the way, and only get to see altair 6 times for around 5 - 10 minutes each. Shortest game so far in the series, yet for some reason more expensive then the games before it, which were much better. In short, don't play this game.

The Virtual Trainings has been replaced by short tutorials on how to throw a knife or a bomb... The horses are completely non-existent, except for some horses pulling carriages in specific interactive cutscenes. The right hand hidden blade has been replaced by a so called "Hook Blade" that replaces the Leap Jump. Basically, the Hook Blade works like Leap Jump, but allows you to reach longer. However, you can only do it where the Hook Blade is able to reach, and no longer whereever you want. This removes the ability to jump straight up, and then reach your arms to a side to grab a ledge.\n\nThey've added a new type of enemy that cannot be killed, except with counters.

The whole Assassins Creed series seems more and more pointless to me. The story has really turned for a worse since the ending of Assassins Creed II, now it's just "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" kind of crap. In other words: they nuked the fridge in the past and they try to do it again and again. The micro story (Ezio in Istanbul) is really flat, the meta story (Desmond and the connections of it all) is waaaay to silly/boring/meh.\n\nBut the overall game could be good nonetheless IF the game weren't that incredibly easy. I mean Assassins Creed 1 was easy (counter killing most enemies, ...), Assassins Creed 2 was easy BUT had some fiercer enemies (with polearms and ♥♥♥♥), Assassins Creed Brotherhood took a turn for the worse ("If you hit me, I'm gonna call my AC brothers to whoop you ♥♥♥!") and in this game, you have this and that and bombs and superior armor and many healing potions, and even when you get down to zero health, you only get a warning "You might die, heal quickly!", but you don't die: you still can take 2 more swings by a blade before you really get desynched. And rifles... you get shot, and you only lose 2 to 3 health points? After that amount of time the AI rifleman needs to aim and really shoot at you it should take at least 50% of your health. There are even some pistol wielding guards who "want" to shoot you in close combat/melee range: they aim at least 3 seconds before they shoot... they could touch you with their pistol tip but hey, better aim that thing before popping it!\n\nThe easiness isn't all: that game has only one real assassination, where you have to sneak up onto your target. All the other missions are run there, go there, get that, buy that, pick some flowers or climb a tower to look for a book... very meaningless, boring tasks, oddly disconnected from the story line. There was only one missions which I found to be enjoyable.

While both of these things are factual things the game actually delievers on, ultimately the entry comes up short in many other aspects.\n\nThe story picks up many years after the events of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, with the fall of the Cesare Borgias and with Assassin Master/Superspy Ezio Auditore hiding the Apple of Eden for Desmond to find in the future.  Four years later, Ezio finds one of five keys needed to unlock Altar's Library, sending him on a search for the rest in a tumultuous and violent Constantinople. While a solid (and very video gamey) set-up, what follows is unfortuantely shapeless and uninteresting, often hitting similar story and character beats from the previous two Assassin's Creed II games. Not to mention the Desmond timeline, which is padded out and only serves to set up conflict for the third game, without really saying much about Desmond or the supporting cast at all.\n\nThe gameplay is bog standard Assassin's Creed. If one is unfamiliar with that, imagine trying to climb slowly up similar looking buildings and running around on rooftops avoiding guards with an increasingly convoluted and bloated set up moves that requires holding down one button in order access half of your movement abilities. One should also not expect stealth mechanics, becaue they are practically nonexistant. One must hide in shrubs and wagons and wells in order to avoid guard detection, but outside of a few areas in the game (in which a forced reset on being spot is used), combat is generally the best option. However, if one is expecting a deep weapons based combat system, prepare to be dissapointed by a system that is designed entirely around countering your enemies attacks. That's it. One simply counters attacks in order to be successful at combat.\n\nRevelations (as generic a subtitle as one can think of) is a victim of publishing tactic called Annual Release, in which a successful franchise is produced on a yearly schedule, often using the same art assists and minor gameplay additions, often leading to contrived plots and half baked gameplay mechanics. In this case there are two new mechanics: the first are through the form of bombs, in which Ezio can craft a multitude of them, only a handful of which are of any good use. The second is through a rather annoying tower defense mini game which appears if you're in too high of alert for too long of time. Fortunately, it's rather easy to avoid this mini game and a player only has to ever do it once, unless they don't pay enough attention to their alert status. It's also telling that neither of these mechanics or minigames found themselves in sequels.\n\nUnfortunately the game does end in a rather satisfying way, so if you have played every Assassin's Creed up to Revelations, it is worth playing through on that merit (but only if it's heavily discounted). Otherwise, one could easily skip this installment and jump straight from Brotherhood and on to Assassin's Creed III.\n\nNote that my playtime for the game is actually 10 hours longer, due to uplay not closing and counting my playtime. Note that this game also uses uplay.","November 1, 2014","false","37.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

If you only like Assassin Creed for it's gameplay and dont care about the story, I would say you should pick this game up. I enjoyed the beginings of the series, where the first game had promise but was repetive and the second game (and brotherhood full price dlc) showed how this series can be interesting with continueing the ideas of the first game. Revelations is where I started to get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the Assassin creed series as a whole. What really made me mad was retconning Altair as some Moses, deemed by an almight power to lead the Assassins completely undermind the whole purpose of the first game. Besides changing his voice to some typical low pitch grawl that is typical in all games today, Altair completely loses any sort of humbleness as everything he deems is now the spoken word of God. Any missions with him pained me the most, and I really wished they just kept it with Ezio. Ezio isnt as charming in this game like how he is in ACII but I can't hate Ezio, even if he didnt do anything too interesting in this game.","November 21, 2014","false","13.0"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","1"

The area control aspect is extremely repetitive and uninspired compared to what Brotherhood had to offer. Every "tower" can be tackled with the same strategy (they lack design) and the areas are extremely similar. They removed the brilliant stealth missions on separate maps, which were one of the best things in Brotherhood. Optional mission objectives ("full sync") were added arbitrarily without much sense of design. Istanbul was a large city I guess, but it seemed too flat and uneventful compared with Rome.","November 13, 2014","false","30.5"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/recommended/201870/","BridgetFisher","BridgetFisher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/","4086 products in account","Like all the past versions of Assassins Creed on PC, this one suffers from dropped support, leaving the game broken in some ways, glitched in others.   This game is abandonware, no more updates with no further support on PC.  There is a news crawl on the bottom that is so out of date there is even a tip that reminds us to preorder AC3 and get all the great preorder bonuses!!!!  This game started out good by giving players a hook to reach higher places, then it went downhill fast.  This is by far the WORST assassins creed game EVER made.  Many of the buildings in the game you cant climb there is nothing there, just a big blank space.  While the controls are as bad as every other PC version, making it so buildings are harder to climb while making the average building much taller this time around 4 stories is a huge pain for navigating the city, especially the fact its broken up into 2 parts.  Taking place in a third world country it has no horses for whatever reason even though there are multiple scenes with carriage chases.\n\nSome of the challenges are almost broken, the Bomb Challenge set 2, rather than get fixed in the last patch got all bugged up.  The bomb challenges are completable by making bombs at the quick station then making them in your inventory.  Took like twenty times of doing it for it to pop, but just keep doing it one by one, and you will get past that menace of a problem.\n\nFor a story you have the end of the Enzio trilogy, so sad to see him go.  There is even a wonderful romance including a picnic for the two lovers in a graveyard.  The time trials are crap, just mirrors edge wannabe clones.  Other parts where you play as Desmond they actually found a way to make more annoying by making it an fps platforming part where you move blocks around, as dumb as that sounds its that stupid to play.\n\nRating:  0/10  Value:  4.99","December 2, 2013","false","70.0"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","9","25","0","0"
