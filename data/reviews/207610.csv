But they are not right either. The choices you make in the game may not have an impact on the end itself, but it will have an impact on how the story gets told to you. Will you become a respectable man, or will you be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ throughout the entire game? The choice is yours.\n\nWhat does matter here is the travel, and not the destination.\n\nThe graphics are enjoyable; you really feel like you're part of the original comics universe. The game developpers also had the good idea to create their own story and not simply take the comics story. This is not a simple adaptation of the comics books, this is a parallel story which does not make some fan services; the references to the books are smart and really not invasive.\n\nAll in all, this is a simple, yet very enjoyable story-driven point-and-click, merging some humor and a lot of drama in a good and smart enough interactive story.\n\nTurn the lights off, and play it alone or with someone else, and discuss about the choices you should make or should have made.\n\nA must play!","November 25, 2014","true","13.3"," 176 of 185 people (95%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","95","176","185","12","5"

I was worried about it going in that it would focus too much on random zombie action and take away from WHY we love the Walking Dead. We like it because it actually has story and character development. Not just random gore. The game is a point and click adventure. If that's not your type of game wait for the crappy FPS coming out soon. (That I'll still probably play.) The timed decisions mechanic is a great move from the developers. Only have seconds to make a split choice really ripens the tension and panic of your situations. On top of that the game has a lot of content. 5 full episodes that can be a couple hours each to finish, with different paths and outcomes depending on how your handle things. Every choice you make can affect you way later down the road to similar to the style Mass Effect recently took.\n\nIf your a fan of the show, comics, zombies in general and like a good game that will challenge your wit and morals, get it.","November 29, 2013","true","22.7"," 333 of 383 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","333","383","2","11"

That a single game could pack so much surprise, scares, shocks (and on numerous occasions I might add) and raw emotion into its core package is proof that gaming has grown up and is a definite showcase for all those naysayers out there that still believe gaming is a children's hobby.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=338123407\nHaving never read the comics by Robert Kirkman or seen the television show upon which this is all based, I went in without a single notion of what to expect and was continually surprised and often dismayed at every corner. Playing as escaped convict - Lee Everett, who has a murky and tragic past - it's not long into the game before you meet up with a young girl named Clementine who is holed up in her tree house after a zombie outbreak in which her caregiver is attacked and killed whilst her parents are out of town on a business trip. Agreeing to accompany the young girl to the city her parents are visiting it becomes clear that not only is Lee looking for redemption but to also to once again feel the need to be needed after a tragic act of violence brought on by a betrayal resulted in his incarceration.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=338122543\nIt's quite astonishing that the game has managed to elicit the protector in all of us just from reading commentary for the game on forum websites from other gamers alike. The level of care the main protagonist develops for the young Clementine over the course of all 5 episodes is truly one of gamings greatest achievements. For the first time ever I really cared about the safety of my little gaming charge and having to witness her grow up so quickly due to the surrounding circumstances was incredibly bittersweet.\n\nThe Walking Dead: Season 1 keeps things very clean and simple in terms of adventuring and item collecting, not like those classics of yester-year with inventories as long a piece of string and more items than you knew what to do with. You will only ever carry one or two items on you at any given point and they act simply as devices to move the story along. Along the way you will also be continually forced to make tough judgement calls that could put you in favor or disfavor with certain individuals of the rag-tag group of survivors you find yourself with which slightly influences the outcome of the story.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=338121505\nWhilst one can argue that there is actually very little gameplay available throughout the entire play-through the emphasis here is on the tale of survivors at what looks like the end of the world as we know it. There are very few lulls which results in the game moving at a frantic clip. One thing is for sure, when the story to your game is this good (and I mean seriously good), you can't blame the developers for wanting to hurry things along or add that sense of urgency that I imagine would be required if facing the end of days.\n\nThe Walking Dead: Season 1 has one of the finest script and voice over character work you are likely to experience in a computer game. This is one of those experiences where everything comes together in alignment so perfectly you would almost think it was celestial. Playing to each characters good and bad nature, each member of the groups feels fully fleshed out and human, firmly rooted to an end of the world reality that sees them respond in a real and relatable ways. This is one of those marvelous games which has the player feeling a range of emotions so don't be surprised if you find yourself shedding a tear or two at some of the games more gut-wrenching sequences.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/207610/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","The Walking Dead is an episodic interactive story adventure developed and published by Telltale Games based on The Walking Dead comic book series.  The game consist of five separate chapters which we released spread out across 2012.\n\nThe game takes place shortly after the start of a zombie apocalypse in the US state of Georgia. Most of the characters are all unique to the game. You play the role of a university professor, who is also a convicted murderer. You rescue and care for a little called called Clementine.\n\nVery much unlike other adventure games, there is hardly any puzzle solving to be found in The Walking Dead; it focuses mainly on the story and character development and relationships. The story is heavily effected by dialogue choices and actions taken during quick time events - these choices will often lead to game altering changes such as a character being killed off etc.  All of the choices and events from one episode are carried over onto the next. I have also leaned since completing the game; that Telltale actually tracked the choices made too, and helped them to influence their writing in later episodes in the story.\n\nYou play the game mainly in a third person perspective and the camera changes depending on the scenery and objects around the player. You are constantly in communication with the rest of your group of survivors; you will build friendships, enemies and you will bond with most of the characters in someway. You will be emotionally attached to them, especially the young child, Clementine. While most of the game is also based around the dialogue, there are a number of quick time events throughout the series, normally I am not a huge fan of QTEs, but these are required in the story in order to get their point across and to at least keep you conscious of your surroundings when playing.\n\nGraphics do not play a huge role in this game; it is by far the least important aspect to be seen. Saying that; the art style is nice and many developers should learn from this that having top of the range graphics isn't always the be all and end all for when creating a game.\n\nThe story is probably the best I have ever seen/heard in a video game; you will be drawn in from the minute you start interacting with different characters, learning about their backstory, building bonds. There are so many twists and turns in the story to keep you guessing too. By the end, if you are like me, you'll be a complete and utter emotional wreck with that the cast have gone through. This is one of the only games that has almost brought me to tears.\n\nSince the game doesn't resolve around fast paced action other than the QTEs, there isn't any real difficulty; there is no "wrong" choice when it comes to dialogue, you are free to let the story develop however you choose.\n\nEach of the chapters level design are so well thought out; there are tons of objects to interact with, pick up and use with you in future situations. If it is of any interest; then you will be able to do something with it. The art style really gets across how doomed the civilized world is in the ruined remains of cities and towns.\n\nI have run through The Walking Dead two times now; my first play through was back when it originally came out during the sporadic release of the episodes, and just recently when I played through them all in a big binge. It is very rare that I want to play through a game again a second time; and The Walking Dead offers exactly the same excitement the second time around; you make different choices allowing the story to change and adapt to them. The whole game takes about fourteen hours to get through all of the chapters; so you are looking at a really good length game/story too.\n\nThe game can be played using a controller too - which is a nice touch given that this is the perfect sort you could play while sitting back on the sofa and soaking up the story.  I also had no other technical problems while playing.\n\nMost people already have The Walking Dead; and most will probably have already played it given it's age now. But this is a genre defining game that has brought the adventure games right back to the forefront of PC gaming. You need to experience this heart wrenching tale. Even if zombies aren't your thing; you will get emotionally hooked from the get go. Do your self a favor and play this masterpiece.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dynsay/recommended/207610/","dynsay","Dynsay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dynsay/","1091 products in account","By and large, most choice-driven games have followed the same formula, inviting you to make your mark in the world by deciding if you want to be “good” or “bad,” and accepting the binary nature of existence. But in the post-apocalyptic world of The Walking Dead, where the titular dead walk the decaying earth, the notion of good and bad is somewhat dated. There’s no “right” when right can mean shooting an innocent child before it can turn into a flesh-eating beast, and there’s no “wrong” when wrong can mean stealing the supplies you need to survive from those just as needy as you. The Walking Dead is the story of the choices you can’t live with, and the choices you can, coming together to create an experience as depressing and pessimistic as it is remarkable and memorable.\n\nThe Walking Dead never pretends to be anything less than a cruel, dour analysis of humanity’s downfall. You’re tossed into the cuffs of Lee Everett, a convicted murderer on his way to prison when the first episode begins. In the opening moments, his police escort is sidetracked by the zombie apocalypse, freeing Lee into a world that’s not nearly as comfortable as a jail cell would've been. Soon, he’s joined by the young Clementine, a child left on her own after her parents took a poorly timed vacation and her babysitter contracted a bad case of the flesh munchies. And off into the new, horrible world Lee goes, hoping to find Clementine’s parents despite knowing that they’re likely dead; off to find sanctuary when he doubts one even exists.\n\nIn stark contrast to the rest of gaming, The Walking Dead is more focused on what you do than how you do it. There aren’t many traditional puzzles, per se, as much as there are tasks that you’re asked to perform to move the story forward. Menial activities like finding batteries for a radio or starting up a train aren’t all that engaging by themselves, but they serve a very necessary pacing purpose, as well as give you a chance to explore the world a bit and get to know the characters better. If you’re looking to rampage around Georgia popping the heads off of undead monsters, you’re better served by one of the many other zombie games on the market.\n\nThough some might be turned off by this minimization of traditional gameplay, it works well in the context of the game. The effect you have on the world is fairly minimal by design, mixing together Telltale’s point-and-click adventure game style with a smattering of quick-time events and choice-driven dialogue. This amorphous take on gameplay works very well to make you feel like you’re a part of the world, without allowing you to go too far off the rails. But just because you’re not allowed to stray too far off the beaten path, doesn’t mean you don’t have an actual influence--on the contrary, your words and actions actually play an integral part in crafting the world.\n\nIncredibly strong writing and voice-acting give the narrative the spotlight it deserves. The vast majority of the characters you interact with are well-developed, and it’s hard not to feel compassion for even the meanest of the bunch, making you actually care about who you foster relationships with and who you choose to disappoint. What’s more, your actions have an impact not just on the events that you encounter, but in how people treat you. Don’t back up Kenny when his son is accused of being bitten, and he might not have your back a few episodes later when you need him to. Side with Lilly when she’s trying to ration the food, and she might respect you enough to help you in the coming episodes.\n\nYour choices, both large and small, have repercussions, and can change the course of the remaining episodes--even if it’s only a slight shift. Split-second choices made later in the game can rewrite how people react to you regardless of how you’ve treated them up to that point, making each and every action all the more important. Inaction, too, is usually an option, amplified by the inclusion of a timer that makes it possible to completely miss a chance at making a decision, forcing you to sit on the sidelines and watch whatever your indifference hath wrought.\n\nThese decisions wouldn't be as emotional if it didn’t feel like there was something on the line, but there is: Clementine. The hopelessness of the world would be infectious if not for her constant optimism, giving you something to fight for. She’s slow to adapt to the fact that good and evil are now meaningless, and her innocence keeps the concept of hope alive in the survivors. More importantly, it makes it harder to justify going against what you think is truly “right,” since you know you’re going to have her big, sad eyes staring up at you. It’s heartbreaking and motivational, inspirational and depressing.\n\nThe Walking Dead’s success isn’t in creating a Choose Your Own Adventure game with hundreds of possible outcomes and limitless plotlines. Instead, it reflect the reality of life, reminding you that many of the choices you’re given have predetermined outcomes, and some things simply can’t be changed. And yet, this undermining of everything that makes The Walking Dead unique is arguably its greatest triumph. Despite not always being in control, The Walking Dead makes you feel as though you are. Even though you can’t always save someone from death, you can give it your best try, shaping the person you are. And it’s up to you to decide if it’s worth the effort to change what, in all likelihood, can not be changed.\n\nSure, you can replay it to see what else would happen, but that won’t change anything. It won’t change that you’re not going to leave The Walking Dead happy. You’ll feel like you made mistakes. You’ll feel like you could have done better, if you gave it another go. At best, you’ll leave without any regrets, knowing that you did the best you could do. The Walking Dead deals in a spectrum of emotion that few other games dare to take on, and it does so with aplomb. It’s utterly triumphant, crafting a narrative that proves the power of the medium by embracing what makes it unique, leading to one of the most memorable gameplay experiences ever created.","September 18, 2015","true","161.0"," 127 of 134 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","127","134","5","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/207610/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","Telltale have made a game in The Walking Dead that helps redefine the Point & Click genre and bring into a more modern era. Alongside that they've truely mastered the art of 'choice'. Many games have attempted to bring the player choice and consequences, but few have managed to do it with great success. Most of the time the player is left with Ending 1 or Ending 2 even though they made 100 'crucial' choices throughout the game.\n\nThe Walking Dead, however, manages to really make the player feel that their choices matter, if not only in the game than morally and emotionally too. It achieves this by having a very story driven game that is supported by some of the best characters in a computer game. Characters that you don't really like (by design) due to their very human faults and personal baggage, yet as the journey progresses you become fond of them - they become part of your group.\nThat's when you know Telltale have you hooked in.\n\nThey manage to pull off The Walking Dead dynamic far greater, and with more ease, than the TV show has ever achieved in 3+ seasons (to date). Sure, computer games have the benefit of having no real watershed or TV Regulations to censor it's content; yet that's not what makes The Walking Dead game effective.\nIt's the high emotion dialect, the interaction between the characters and the observations you make as Lee (... and you will find yourself becoming Lee). All of this happens as a great underplayed soundtrack supports the drama, which at times pays a little tribute to previous Zombie Movie music (such as the electronic throbs of Dawn of the Dead's music).\n\nWhen I look back I find no real fault in The Walking Dead, as long as you're aware of what you're letting yourself become a part of. This isn't an action game - it's one of the best emotionally driven interactive stories you will play. It's very easy to see why this game won so many awards in 2012.\n\nSo if you're a fan of strong characters, story driven gameplay, or are perhaps intrigued at the prospect of a modernised 'Point and Click' adventure then you should check out The Walking Dead. The good news is that you'll be able to play all 5 Chapters of Season 1 today, which will put you in a good place for Season 2 (which will hopefully be released early 2014).\nThe bad news is... you'll have to wait for the drip feed of each chapter in Season 2 to be released...","November 26, 2013","true","16.2"," 157 of 183 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","157","183","0","7"

And just like on real life, some of them you will have to carry with you until the end of story.\n\nAlthough you have to follow a lot of dialogues, more than real action, you cannot simply sit down and think, most of times. You have to be ready to act or make decisions, so you just stare at the screen, and not rarely you can feel you're really there, a deep immersion factor.\n\nSoundtrack is decent, matching the tension. Graphics are wonderful, and history too.\nI can see just two problems about that game:\n\nYou can lost a split second, confusing by the controls, and sometimes it's lethal. The good news is that although the game have not a better save system than autosave, if you die on the middle of an action scene the autosave brings you exactly at the point you died.\n\nAlso, the game have a lot of replay value, if you think you can have different decisions to make and different things to handle according on how you act before. But the game needs a way to skip some cut scenes or even dialogues faster, for those who previously finished.\n\nOne of the best and imaginative games i've ever played.","September 22, 2013","true","23.8"," 125 of 148 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","125","148","0","0"

Characters are simply amazing, ambient, story, plot...this is simply a game where you care about certain characters and what will happen with them. What an amazing character Lee was, while playing it there's definitely that TV Show series feeling. Definitely look into playing this, you won't regret buying it. One more thing to note, if you're getting the game, also consider getting that DLC story extension, it's really worth it.\n\n\nBADNothing really bad with it at all but one thing, once you finish it do not but do not start playing it again, because most of choices are leading towards the same consequences, that's what I realized while replaying it and I stopped replaying it because of that.","May 6, 2015","true","13.8"," 117 of 137 people (85%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","85","117","137","16","5"

Music and climate are high. The man despite the fact that the game can be completed in little more than 10 hours can really bind strongly to the characters. Dedication, fear, mutual aid, quarrels, the joy of trivial things etc. I think playing shows all the possible emotions of people posed in such a situation. The diversity of our comrades characters differ greatly. Some of you may not like, but overall a really polished game. The graphics in this game is not the most important, and this line not everyone can appeal to, but I think it's really cool it looks as a whole. As someone got hold of the devaluated on Steam did a good step. In terms of story, the game for me is in second place when it comes to the game in general.

This is more of an interactive story that anyone can play wrapped together like a point and click adventure. Most of the time, you're just watching a great story play out with excellent voice acting. It is based more on the comic book than the TV show, but the first episode does have a character from the TV show in a cameo. The story will have you playing Lee, a man that starts off in police custody until a zombie apocalypse happens. You will meet a little girl named Clemontine and basically be her guardian.  The story is littered with crazy and hotheaded characters, along with pleasant and reasonable ones for a nice contrast.\n\nIn this story, you make decisions that affect lives. Who lives and who dies. After completing the game on PSN and going through it on Steam, I have a pair of play throughs contrasting. Even small choices like who you side with in arguments will drastically affect the dialog, but not the story. Everything will unfold in a way that is pre determined, but its always your choices that will get you to the same place.\n\nBasically someone will always have to die and someone will always hate you. The story gets pretty intense and they talk about topics that no other video game would touch, such as killing kids. Its not all heavy, there is some humor sprinkled in and moments of down time. Because of the choices, this warrants several play throughs, but nothing really changes the game, so much as the dialog and how people react to you.\n\nThe game is broken into 2+ hour episodic chunks that come out every so often in 5 episode 'seasons.' You can either buy the episodes one by one, or buy the season pass. There is even an interlude episode to bring you from the first to second season. Personally, I say wait until a season is over to buy the entire season than play episode by episode month after month when they come out.","June 29, 2013","true","13.9"," 120 of 148 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","120","148","0","0"

The trip takes an unexpected turn as his life turn into a living hell.\n\nStoryline/Gameplay\nJust like it's TV series counterpart. The Walking Dead game is not about killing zombies. There is barely an action in the game. TWD focuses more on the psychological effect of a world crisis into the human mind. The game will handle mostly about frustrations and being smart. You could say this game involves a lot of puzzle-like gameplay utilizing what's around to survive. The puzzles aren't that hard but it might be tricky for some and it can get really boring and repetitive.\n\nMechanics\n"This game is taillored by how you play."\nTrue and false.\nThis is very misleading. Although changes are made when you pick different choices in the end it will go back to the linear storyline and proceed accordingly without taking your choices into account. From time to time, you'll see "<name> will remember that" but they do not have an impact to the game. The same thing basically happens just different dialogues.\n\nGraphics\nThe Walking Dead series gives off a thrilling atmosphere despite having intentional cartoonish textures and low-poly models. But overall, how the entire world and character are designed makes this game really good overall.\n\nFinal thoughts\nAlthough I gave mostly of the bad points in this game, I still recommend you to buy it especially with a discount. The story can really live an impression to some people and you might enjoy the horrific adventure.","January 15","true","14.8"," 57 of 68 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","57","68","3","2"

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:The Walking Dead by Telltale Games is an episodic video game based on the popular Comic Book series of the same title which was made mainstream by an equally popular TV series, also of the same title. The game features 5 'Episodes' with a 6th Episode as DLC. It boasts an outstanding plot, great characters and immersive choice and consequence based storytelling.\n\nYou are Lee Everett, a professor on his way to prison for the murder of a US State Senator who was having an affair with Lee's wife. The game starts with Lee at the back of a police car when he met an accident that wounded him and killed his officer escort. All hell breaks loose when he discovers that the dead now walks and is hungry for human flesh but, in his desperate search for help, he stumbles across a young girl named Clementine. Follow their struggles as they try to survive a terrifying and deadly world in this post-apocalyptic suspense game where every choice you make directly impacts the lives of the people around you.\n\nPROS:+ Great use of 3D cell-shaded art style\n+ Excellent example of Consequence based choices and Story (The game's biggest selling point)\n+ Great Story\n+ Great voice acting\n+ Memorable characters\n+ True to the Comics source material\n+ Good game time and nice replayability\n+ Guilt inducing choices\n+ Stress inducing choices\n\nCONS:- Restrictive camera\n- Very small maps with no room for exploration (I don't mean it should be sandbox, but it would have been nice if the players had more leg room)\n- Gameplay is a bare minimum (not much to do)\n- Some choices have no real impact to the overall plot\n- Tendency to have some boring scenes and segements\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME. RECOMMENDED for both fans of the comics and gamers who are into good stories and plots. The Walking Dead by Telltale Games is the best example of immersive consequence based storytelling I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. The story is top notch with a well written and well round characters who were excellently voiced. The art style works in the game's favor as the cell-shaded world captures the look, feel and tone of the comics.\n\nGameplay, sad to say, is a bare minimum, nothing to do more than make decisions. Some of the action sequences are heart pounding, but in it's core, its just a regular Quick Time Event scenario. The game also suffers from a restrictive camera with some odd angles. Despite these though, the game is still WORTH IT whether it be full price or sale price. This is a MUST HAVE game even for just the experience.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

The sole purpose as being the player is to make the decision that could mean a multitude of different events. Either a character dies. A character does not listen or heed your advice anymore. You become their leader or you become the hated individual. This whole game is built solely on the premise that the player makes the decision through point and click. Whether conversation dialogue or quick time events, it is up to the player to decide which way he will go. Kind of like those "choose your own adventure books" where you jump to a certain page in the book to see what your decision brings.\n\nI have never watched the Walking Dead TV show but this game made me want to start. I thought the story and the plot around Clementine and your decision as Lee to protect her made this a compelling character dynamic and plot. It makes you the player feel relevant in the events and your decisions, which makes the point and click experience more compelling and an improvement from previous point and clicks I have played, where puzzles and story were linear.\n\nThis game made me a fan of Telltale and led to me playing others from the developer. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good story and character development and other games by Telltale.","February 23, 2014","true","13.6"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","40","45","0","3"

It is not a game for everyone, but to those who appreciate other genre of video games will simply love how unique and fantastic 'TWDG' really is. In fact, it the most unique game I have ever played and provided me perhaps my most favorite experience playing a video game.\n\nThe mechanics of TWDG is essentially point and click. The core elements will not have you constantly shooting zombies or platforming of any sort, it is basically a fantastic story that you are apart of, you can investigate the surrounding or engage in conversations with other survivors. But there are two main parts about the game that make it so incredible. The journey you go through as a player is memorable, each episode is innovative and different with the current and new characters really engage you into the story.\n\nBut perhaps the number one reason why TWDG is an incredible game is how the writers managed to pull off the amazing relationship and chemistry between Lee and Clementine. Lee is Clem's father figure, each conversation you have has significance and you really care for her throughout, you simply can't hate her.\n\nAll I can say is The Walking Dead Game will be a game like none you have played before, its cheap and worth a try because by the time you beat the story, it will be one of your favorite games ever.","May 7","true","15.8"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","31","34","0","0"

You take control of Lee Everett, a college professor who has been convicted of a serious crime and beings the game in the back of a cop car. After escaping from his cuffs and surviving a near fatal encounter with a walker Lee stumbles into the home of Clementine, an eight year old girl whose parents left for Savannah prior to the onset of the zombie epidemic. Her innocence juxtaposes Lee's dark past and she is in many respects a source of redemption as Lee takes it upon himself to protect her and help reunite her with her family. The relationship between Lee and Clementine carries the experience. Clementine herself is very likable and despite her age she never comes off as too needy or whiny. Lee himself comes off as sympathetic and  cultivating his relationship with Clementine is an emotional investment rarely found in games.\n\nWhere The Walking Dead's tale succeeds is in its focus on the dark side of humanity rather than the danger of undead flesh eating cannibals. At times it can be brutal and gut-wrenching. There are conflicts within your party, conflicts with bandits and clashes with other survivors. These situations are more compelling than facing off with walkers and offer an appreciable degree of moral ambiguity, generally culminating in a brutally nihilistic resolution. This moral ambiguity is important since most of the gameplay in The Walking Dead centers around managing your relationships with those in your party. Members of your groups almost always have dissenting opinions and it breeds conflict. During conversations you get to choose how to respond and unlike other titles that allow you to voice the protagonist and make choices, The Walking Dead features a timer that prevents you from analyzing your decisions. It keeps the tension up and the conversations flowing naturally. Who you side with and what you say determines how close you are to each person and can ultimately affect how they react in future scenarios. If a character feels that you have their interests in mind they will back you and those who you oppose may become hostile to Lee.\n\nWhile this sounds great on paper in practice it's not as exciting as it seems. The problem is that in spite of giving you a lot of decisions to make, The Walking Dead doesn't change much in terms of it's narrative arc. Some scenarios ask you to make a choice that to save one character causing the other to perish. These two characters generally serve the same role in the plot and there isn't a compelling reason to see both scenarios play out since you won't see any noteworthy additions to the experience. You see the same locations and partake in the same scenarios and puzzles. You as the player have little overall influence on the the narrative and the experience is cheapened by attempting to take another approach on a second playthrough since it becomes apparent very quickly how inflexible the game is. With it's episodic release schedule, it's wholly understandable that The Walking Dead doesn't feature a massive branching narrative but it would have been nice if the path you take to the conclusion of each episode could vary. As it stands there isn't much replayability in The Walking Dead.\n\nPuzzles and gameplay in the Walking Dead are rudimentary, some sequences have you aiming a weapon to take down a few walkers, quick time events are sprinkled throughout the game's five episodes and DLC and there are only a few puzzles. While The Walking Dead gleefully avoids the obtuse puzzles that characterize many point and click games it's simplicity can be off putting to veteran gamers. Puzzles have very apparent solutions and often the only objects you can pick up are the ones used to solve a puzzle. Having a few red herrings or multiple solutions to a scenario might have made these sequences more rewarding.","November 25, 2013","true","22.1"," 49 of 64 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","49","64","0","0"

This is executed perfectly by Telltale with a cell-shaded art style that mimics a comic and a very well-written story that tailors the story to the choices and actions of the player.\n\nGameplay is very simple.  The player is often presented with choice-driven dialog.  The narrative is carefully paced through player interactions with objects and persons in the environment and the action pieces are accomplished via quick-time events.  This style of gameplay is perfect since it does not burden the player with complex mechanics and allows for focus on the plot and story elements.\n\nAs I have already mentioned, the story is very well written.  Characters are well developed to the point that I cared about them.  Tough decisions are often presented which were almost always painful to make.  What really impresses me most is that this game is presented as a survival story and the zombies are often not the worst dangers to the team.  This really makes me think deeper about the primal nature of humans and some of the disturbing things we would do to survive at all costs.  This is not your typical zombie game.  I have never watched the TV series that this is based on, but if the narrative for those shows are like this game, I may just start watching these.\n\nThis is a very good game for those who like narrative-driven adventures.  I highly recommend.\n\n\nIn addition, if you are an achievement hunter, it is very easy to 100% this game by simply doing a single playthrough.","December 1, 2013","true","15.8"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/207610/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","When it was first announced that The Walking Dead would be getting a video game version, you wouldn't have been crazy to assume it would be some kind of survival horror shooter. After all, zombie shooters seem to be all the rage these days. But The Walking Dead was never really about shooting zombies, instead focusing on the horrible things people do when trying to survive. Zombies aren't as scary as people pushed to their limits, and it just takes a couple walking corpses to get people to show their worst. So instead of some sort of bullet-filled slaughter-fest, Telltale has decided to create a socially focused point-and-click adventure game.\n\nOn the surface, this genre fits The Walking Dead superbly. The game forces you to make harsh decisions constantly. Nearly every dialogue choice is timed, forcing you to answer with your gut instinct. As a result, the main character Lee Everett very quickly becomes a reflection of yourself, causing you to empathize with his plight. Though this does get annoying at some points, most notably points where there really isn't any sort of urgency to your response, it does successfully prevent gamers from exploiting the system to always pick the "right" response.\n\nThe decision-making in The Walking Dead is probably the most enjoyable part of the game. Let's get something straight right now: There is no happy ending to a zombie apocalypse. At times, you will have to choose who lives and who dies, and that is a weight that will sit heavy on your shoulders. Very simple decisions could mean the difference between surviving and becoming zombie chow, and it's not always obvious which decision you should make. Thankfully, it's incredibly hard to get a "game over." Your comrades might die, but you continue on, dealing with the ramifications of your decisions while you're just trying to live another day in a zombie hellhole.\n\nOne thing that makes The Walking Dead stand apart from other adventure games is its constantly updating tip system. The game informs you via pop-up notices whenever you do something actively important to the story. It will notify you as to how people are reacting to your decisions and remind you of important facts you have learned. Because of this, you don't feel like you are flying blind during social interactions. The game notifies you of the consequences of your decisions, and this not only lets you play the game more intelligently, but also makes subsequent playthroughs much more fun as you know exactly where the story branches off.\n\nThe writing for the most part is great, but there are some strange parts that feel like they were put in just to pad things out. An example is when an adult radio journalist needs your help to get a radio working. Not only did she not realise that it had no batteries, but then she asks you to find her batteries because she wouldn’t know what they look like. I’m sorry, but my four year old niece could have gotten that radio working, so that whole “quest” came off as more annoying and made the character look a lot stupider than she is presented otherwise. I mean for God’s sake, she’s the character that everyone lets hold the gun!\n\nThis game is certainly not a point-and-click adventure in the traditional sense. The focus on building an inventory and solving puzzles is seriously toned down, replaced by an intense focus on story instead. It feels more like a "cinematic gameplay experience" than a traditional point-and-click puzzler. It would be more apt to compare the game to Heavy Rain, a sort of interactive movie, than to Monkey Island.\n\nWhen there are puzzles, the game makes sure that they aren't too hard. Everything you can interact with is highlighted with clickable icons so you are never stuck wasting time trying to find that one important item you missed. Your inventory isn't even usable in the traditional sense. You can't access it in any way. Instead, simply having an item will bring up new options when trying to interact with other people and your environment. Some of these interactions are red herrings, of course. I once tried to use a remote control on a combination lock, only to find that the remote "wasn't that universal." Still, the game greatly streamlines the traditional point and click gameplay process.\n\nNot only that, but failing puzzles doesn't necessarily stop the game. Instead, the game simply continues on, generally leaving you in a disadvantageous position. Unfortunately, this does mean that you can miss out on some important story details by performing certain actions too early, and this makes the story feel like It's jumping around a bit. At one point, I found out that two characters liked each other, only this wasn't until one of them had already met a tragic end. If I had talked to people in a different order, I would have known this ahead of time, which would have made the death scene hit much harder.\n\nAs gripping as the story is, there are some major flaws in the gameplay that mostly stem from its adventure game formula. This mostly has to do with finding item A to give to person B to progress the game. At one point you have to find a picture of a zombie in order to convince your friend that he once worked at a pharmacy and may have the pharmacy keys. However, the zombie is the only one in the area wearing a pharmacist's uniform, and this is very easy to see even from far away. Similarly, the picture doesn't even look at the zombie, which at this point is rotted beyond recognition. It felt like I should have just been able to say "Dude, look at what he's wearing." But I couldn't.\n\nPoints like these pop up all throughout the game. At one point you can't reach a brick that is a few inches in front of you, even though there are tons of long objects that would allow you to knock it your way. To reach it, you have to get outside, but to do that you have to axe off the lock on the gate. This would be a fine puzzle, except you find the axe at a motel—which you get to by leaving the place you were via the back entrance. If leaving via the back were so easy, you literally could have just gone around front and picked up that damn brick. There's also a whole puzzle about finding a weapon to kill zombies with, but at this point you had already passed several knives, canes, and even a shotgun that the game didn't allow you to pick up. It just breaks your sense of immersion at points. It strikes me that these puzzles could have easily been reworked to be more plausible.\n\nAs much as I nitpick, I still enjoyed The Walking Dead. As a fan of the comics, the game absolutely nails the tone and setting. Important characters like Hershel and Glen make an appearance, and they act just as you would expect them to. The voice acting is great, and the models are very expressive. You can tell exactly when someone is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at you, or terrified at the zombies that are chasing you.","April 23","true","58.2"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","24","25","0","2"

It's one of those rare games that make you feel for the characters and get attached to them and their story. While the gameplay is pretty simple, it's the decisions that you have to make which are hard, too hard at times. The circumstances and situations that are portrayed in the story makes you see how tough decision taking in life can be. If it''s tough for you to decide something major in a video game, about fictional characters then I can only imagine how tough it would be in real life. In some cases where I had to decide the fate of someone who killed my friend or something similar and was clearly a bad guy, even then compassion comes into play and even deciding the fate of a murderer gets really tough. The game makes you do brutal things. Physically normal under  such circumstances as presented in the game but emotionally brutal.\n\nThe story of this game is grasping and really interesting from the start. The decision making and choosing what or what not to speak is a great factor that makes the game. The quick time events are great as well. This game would make you feel contemplative many times, sometimes a bit melancholy, might even make you shed a few tears and would also make you feel enraged at which points you would feel like killing a character or beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of them but when the game actually gives you the choice to do that, it would become a hard choice.

This game is based on the official TV show, but its story is different with new characters, although they still evolve in the exact same zombie world as in the original TV show.\n\nThere have been too many zombie-themed games prior to The Walking Dead game, but the latter infuses renewed energy into an over-exploited genre. Its primary strength lies in its story. The graphics and game engine are particularly fine-tuned to deliver the intended experience. Oh, what a fantastic story! The script is simply superb and pushes the limits all the time. You can never be sure of what's going to happen next. Any of the main characters can meet with some unexpected event and die. You learn that early in the first episode. The game itself revolves around your decisions and the consequences of your acts will guide the rest of the gameplay. The first season comprises of 5 episodes plus 1 DLC which bridges the storyline between season 1 and 2.\n\nThroughout the game, it really surprised me that some of decisions i made from episode 1 still carried over to the other episodes, until the last one. The characters reacted differently to what i had expected as they recalled some of my actions in the previous episodes of the game. This changed the game and ultimately the game experience. You can replay this game several times and depending on your choices when interacting with the characters and the game itself, you will be able to explore The Walking Dead game's universe even further. This game reveals surprises at every corner. The human factor and the line between what's morally right and what's needed to survive is often blurred. You will have some difficult choices to make as the story evolves but sometimes you just have to do what it takes to get out of the situation alive.\n\nIt's zombie apocalypse and civilization has ceased to exist. You play as one of the survivors in a small group, not knowing what to expect. The game delivers a truly excellent story, right next to the high standards set by the original TV series. This title is basically half movie and half game. Explore and appreciate the realism and consequences behind your every click and turn.","January 22, 2014","true","22.0"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","4"

It’s up there with the first season of The Walking Dead tv series before it devolved into a sh*tty soap opera in its later seasons. I’m hoping season 2 and 3 of the game doesn’t make the same mistakes the tv series made.  Apparently this is based on the comic book universe and not the tv series universe, so any main characters you run into in this like (SPOILER)…..Glenn, is the Glenn from the comic book universe.\n\nThings are constantly happening and escalating which keeps tension high and you slightly on edge throughout, you just know something f*cked up is about to happen most of the time. It’s not like the tv show where there were a lot of filler episodes in the later seasons. There’s 5 episodes in the game, and one DLC episode each lasting around 2 hours in length. Each episode has you go to a different area, so your surrounding environment is always different. The DLC episode 400 days is way too short, and seems to be only for introducing characters that will be in season 2.\n\nThe characters in this are really great, Lee and Clementine being the two standouts. The writing, character interactions and voice acting all comes across as authentic and better written than the tv series.\n\nDon’t be fooled by the cartoony aesthetic for the game, this is maybe the darkest and depressingly bleak game I have ever played (in a good way), or at least finished. The ambient and sombre musical scores really add to it as well. Episode 3 is especially f*cked up, putting you in situations and having you make choices you REALLY don’t want to make (“quack”, if you’ve played it you know what I mean by that). This game is the definition of giving you the feels, getting to you in an emotional way which many games and other types of media like tv or films even fail to do most of the time.\n\nSaying all of that though, the actual “game” elements are severely lacking. I know it’s a point and click game, but they have you do the most basic searching and puzzle solving you could think of in a game. Example being, you need to find a pencil, and when you go to “look” in the RV that’s literally the only thing you can interact with, there’s no choices, or other objects to pick up. Most of the time it will be telling you to find a weapon, and there’s only one weapon there, there was only once or twice where it actually let you choose between different weapons.\n\nAlso the overall narrative only has one trajectory, you will always end up in the same place, at a certain moment one character will always die, you get to choose who lives and dies, but later on if that character dies and you wonder if you had chosen the other person instead, would it have turned out differently?…..it doesn’t. The choices you make and dialogue options you choose may affect your appearance or how certain characters treat you, but overall it’s the same story whatever you choose.\n\nLuckily the characters and writing are strong enough to overcome those drawbacks. Is it worth you playing it instead of watching a walkthrough on youtube? I would say yes, depending on how you answer questions or who you side with, you can find out more about people in your group so it has some replay value in that sense, and your playthrough would be different enough that it’s worth playing. Also when it’s actually you clicking a button to smash a zombies head in, or making tough emotional decisions, you are way more invested in the outcome than when you are a passive observer.","April 26","true","12.7"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

There were some jumpscares and a gruesome scene (at least for my choice anyway) near the end of the story and it was rather shocking.\n\nThe whole last chapter pretty much had me tense, assuming I knew what was coming. Midway when I finally got Clem, everything was falling apart. The last scene is rather heartbreaking and properly had those water molecules flowing from my eyes, it was too much and was expertly crafted.\n\nThe music alone makes this game amazing.

Interesting characters guide your way through the zombie apocalypse and your choices have a big impact, not just on their relationship with you, but lives may depend on you! Character development is done really well in this one. You can actually relate to some people from the game and careful with the emotions...\nIt's a nice break from all the run and shoot games, if you're in for an amazing story, then go play this one! :)","January 25, 2014","true","17.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

There are alot of dialogues in the game where you have to give answers. The answer you choose changes the whole gameplay... its a bit like in reallife: When you say something stupid or you lie and they notice it... everything changes... And you can't go back in time. :D There are also fights in the game with zombies and you have to search solutions... for example how you can save someone who is catched in a house with some zombies infront of the house when you have no weapon. ^^ I really like this game. I just miss Daryl. ♥ So I will buy the second game of TWD too. :D","July 17, 2013","true","13.7"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","3"

At least that would make sense. OK, having couple of zombie games is fine...But this is out of hand! I don't understand why people keep eating this s**t up. Most zombie games, like 3/4, are not even mediocre! They're downright horrible!\n\nThis game tho. This game right here. This, this is a masterpiece. The storytelling, voice acting, character development, the music...It's all so very well done.\nIf you're a bit more sensitive then you will cry...A LOT. The game does a great job of keeping the story intense at all times. You just can't wait to see what happens next.\n\nThere's not much gameplay but that's fine in my opinion. We play adventure games for the story and this is why i like TellTales new take on the adventure genre. The formula they have in their latest titles is just so perfect for storytelling!\nThe gameplay is there tho. Some quick time events, a bit of walking and picking up items...That's pretty much it.\nI recommend using a controller and playing while sitting on a couch 'cus you want to sit back and enjoy the story...Like you're watching a good movie. A long movie.\nTook me about 10h to finish the entire game. That's about 2h per chapter. That's like a length of a full "The Walking Dead" season. Only that this one is actually good and has a gripping story.\n\nThis is one of the few zombie games i recommend getting.

I as a fan of the series, could not miss it. It is much heartier and more severe than the TV series. I was very happy that the game is sustained in the style of comics, as it is a little smooths everything. Stunning heroes, great music, great views. This interactive story will not leave anyone indifferent, even those who don't like zombie game, and those who do not like this genre. Each character has its own character, you get used to them, you miss them experience (even minor). The game will sometimes makes decisions so quickly that you regret about his spontaneous choice. The game makes upset, angry, and sometimes even turn away from what is happening on the screen. It includes an excellent drama and the spooky horror. All series and even the seasons are related to your previous decisions, which gives full sense of immersion and responsibility for your decisions, whatever they may be. you will not be disappointed\n\n1. Потрясающий сюжет, заставляющий переживать за всех героев и полностью быть в их шкуре в самых диких ситтуациях, и переживать как они.\n2. Отличное музыкальное сопровождение. Музыка и нагнетает атмосферу, где нужно, и заставляет чуть ли не слезу пустить в драматичных моментах.\n3. Хоть игра и выполнена в виде комикса, жестяка и суровости в ней намного больше, чем в сериале, и драмы больше в десятки раз. Играл я после сериала, и неожидал на сколько игра меня проймёт. За душу берёт местами сильно и так же сильно иногда заставляет отвернуться от экрана или разозлиться на ситтуацию и на выбор.\n4. Игра сделана в стиле интерактивного сериала. Приходится принимать решения быстро и изменить их больше нельзя, вы будете переживать за свои ошибки, я уверен. Также ваши решения переходят от серии к серии и даже во второй сезон.\n5. Рекомендую не спойлерить себе и играть спонтанно. Даже плохие решения по началу могут вылиться в хороший итог в дальнейшем. Играйте от души и от эммоций. Игра не ведётся на РПГшные выкрутасы, ВЫ НИКОГДА не выйдете сухим из воды\nИгра из серии MUST HAVE.

I feel it's a waste of time and effort but I felt a need to do one for The Walking Dead.\n\nThe stylized graphics look really great to me. For the times I noticed it, the music is great and perfectly matches what you're looking at. Gameplay is your typical point and click but with keyboard movement controls and QTEs thrown in which works well. All these make for a mediocre game if not for the story which is what makes this game the masterpiece that it is.\n\nAll that being said, I hate this game. I only recommend this to get as many people as possible to suffer with me.\n\nThe game will constantly put you in situations you do not want to be in and force you to make hard decisions. Many times I wanted to stand up and walk away but the game will suck you in and compel you to keep going through its many screwed-up events. We're talking about "A Song of Ice and FIre" level of screwed-up. You find yourself loving the characters and hating some but one thing you won't be able to do is be indifferent. Even the most passive gamer would find him/herself emotionally invested. I was an unwilling participant and fought as hard as I could against the poignant and visceral feelings the game stirs up but broke down at the very end.\n\nI play games for amusement and entertainment, I was neither amused nor entertained but was powerless to stop myself from seeing the game through. The last time I felt this way was when I watched "Grave of Fireflies" the first time and I had to watch reruns of Modern Family and Big Bang Theory over the next few days to recover. I am currently steeling myself before firing up Season 2 and was advised to get Tales From the Borderlands as a possible antidote after.\n\nTL;DR: A masterpiece. 10/10. Will never play again.

For the first time I saw the game on YouTube. Initially, the graphics has discouraged me, but this game confirms that sometimes it doesn't matter on it. You play all the time as a teacher and murderer Lee, whose life stories are developed simultaneously with the game. With Lee you recognize the other main character - Clementine , who will also accompany you in a whole game. During the game you will know more new characters but also some of them you will lose, due to your decisions which affects the course of the game. However, in the game you have limited decision time and less able people may have a problem with selection answers. Great voices of the characters and a soundtrack perfectly complements a powerful story.\n\n+ the diversity of the characters (some of them you will love, some of them you will hate)\n+ powerful story\n+ great DLC\n+ Clementine ♥\n\n- you can't skip the end of every episode\n\nDLC: 400 days\nI am glad that I receive this DLC to the walking dead.

It's not based on the tv series. It's based on the comics and there are few cameos from those as well. Keep in mind that this game is not all about blasting thousands of zombies away. It's stories about survival and the people. In this game you have to make hard choices, usually all them have some pros and cons and will haunt you later in the game. It's a great game and this game truly is tailored by the choices made. There are even really surprising twists, which sometimes make you think that you should have done it the other way. But that's what makes this game so great. It has a great plot and all the episodes are out. So what are you waiting for? Grab it and see zombie apocalypse from the point of casual people trying to survive rather than a single hero surviving and slaying hundreds. Just warning tho, this game isn't a fairy tale.

After all the zombie apocalypse in The Walking Dead: The Game — only scenery, some kind of shelter in which the main character should "be grazed". The gloomy picture against which the present drama of the relations is played. The plot of "A New Day" covers the first days of infection. Those which Ric Grayms (the main character of the comic book and series) safely carried out in a coma. But, as well as in the original, large-scale scenes of an apocalypse stayed behind scenes. Patrol cars carrying by by, the helicopter which has flown over the head, and rare firing in the distance — here and all doomsday. We will hide in the thrown houses, to wander about Hershel's farm (one more character, the acquaintance according to the comic book and series), to barricade in the shop which was once belonging to parents of Li Everett... In each of scenes you learn something new about the past of the main character and his little companion. The relations of the child and Li who involuntarily became "nurse" — a keynote of all series. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).","February 19, 2014","true","12.9"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dramira/recommended/207610/","Dramira","Cannibal Countess","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dramira/","214 products in account","A powerful story I got to experience, not just observe.\n\nIn an era of games about survival, The Walking Dead examines both your heart and mind, not just your trigger finger.\nWill you protect yourself from threats by any means or will you try to keep your humanity? Who will you help and who will you hurt? Sometimes, even if you do your best, the worst will still come afterwards.\nWhile not a fan of the TV series and never having read the comics, I found myself immediately immersed in the world of this game and connected with the different characters. It felt like I had to think and react in near real time. The choices I could make were often far from ideal and the conflict affected me deeply. At times my heart was lifted and many it was broken. A brilliant story with gameplay that isn't about winning, but introspection. I don't feel I can say more than what's been said about this game by others, just add myself to the collective of people who think they experienced something exceptional. Any perceived flaws are slight blemishes that can be easily looked past due to the many highlights this game offers and the total refinement of the story, in my opinion.","March 27, 2015","true","17.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"

If I mention anything specific, it is only a fabricated example.  That being said, let's start with the technical stuff, which is based off of the keyboard/mouse PC gameplay.\n\nI should also mention that I've never seen the TV series, nor read the comic series that this game is based upon.  I have read that this game follows a different set of characters, so you don't have to worry about spoilers via crossovers.\n\nMOVEMENT:  W-A-S-D or Arrow keys.\n\nFIGHTING:  Q and E keys\n\nSAVING/PAUSING/LOADING:\n\nThere is no option to save -- it's automatic.  Watch for a swirl of lines in the top right corner.  This is the game saving your progress.  If you exit the game or go back to the main menu, you will lose anything you've done since the last auto-save.\n\nTo pause the game, just hit the Escape key.  You'll go right back to where you left off (even in the middle of a conversation) when you continue.\n\nTHE ZOMBIES:\n\nThese are not the running, jumping, climbing, can-almost-think-type of zombie that you see in the movies as of late.  What we have in The Walking Dead are the more classic-style of the undead.  They shamble, barely have the coordination to stand upright.  They're slow because their bodies are rotting away.  They will never stop coming.\n\nThere seem to be three things they react to:  Sight, sound, and a ravenous hunger for living flesh.\n\nTo fight off the undead, rapidly hit the Q key when you see the prompt on the screen, and be ready to hit the E key to attack as soon as the prompt pops up.  Sometimes you'll have to use the mouse to aim an attack, and that's not as easy as you may think!  During fighting scenes the cursor can be hard to move around.  Make no mistake, this is definitely intentional, and a brilliant decision by the development crew.  It really adds to the reality and intensity of the situation, further immersing you in the story.\n\nYOUR CHOICES WILL AFFECT THE WAY THE PLOT OF THE GAME.  You're told this each time you start a new chapter of the game, and it's absolutely true.  Not only do your choices carry over from one chapter to another, but also to new seasons.  We play as a man named Lee, and WE choose what his personality is like.  Is he angry and defiant?  Calm and caring?  Some combination of the two?  That's entirely up to YOU, and it will affect how the other characters interact with you.\n\nThere is not a lot of fighting, as one might expect from a title about zombigeddon.  Yes, of course we struggle, we shoot, we flee, and sometimes we die... but the primary thrust of the game is the story.  This is like no adventure game I've ever seen, seeming more like we're part of a movie, rather than playing a game.\n\nIn tense situations, as in real life, we don't have an unlimited amount of time to decide what to say or do.  We have to make some snap decisions, and it heightens the immersiveness, wrapping around our psyche, taunting, calling, making us unable to stop thinking about what's happened, and what WILL happen because of our choices.\n\nThe way interactions and inventory are handled are much different than I'm used to.  You can see small icons that show your inventory on the left-hand side of the screen, but you don't do the usual "click on inventory item, then click on the scene" routine.  Instead, when you mouse-over a hotspot on the scene, you will see options that you can choose from (assuming that there's more than one action available.)  If it's possible to try an inventory item on that spot, you'll see it in the options.  Just use your mouse wheel or arrow keys on your keyboard to highlight your desired choice; same as you do when you're having a conversation or choosing an action to take.\n\nThis is not the kind of game where you can speed up the dialogue or skip cutscenes.  The Walking Dead is all about experiencing the story, and what a story it is!  Intense, gripping, distressing, touching.  Through all of the turmoil and strife, there are still moments that made me smile; even laugh out loud!  The only other game I've seen that evoked so much emotion was Cognition, though of course for entirely different reasons.\n\nSIGHTS & SOUNDS:\n\nYou can see from the screenshots that the characters are done graphic art-style.  Not surprising since this is based off a comic book series.  And yet... deep within the gameplay, there are startling moments when the characters look real.  I would swear that they had live actors doing the modelling.  The mannerisms are so well done, the nuances of expression so poignant.  A slight softening of the eyes, the ghost of a smile... Beautifully done!\n\nThere is some gore, but it's tolerable... and to be expected!  This IS a game featuring the dead, after all!  I have one friend who is not into zombies at all, and another who really can't stand gore, and both were so completely sucked in by the story that they couldn't stop playing!\n\nThe music is so perfectly melded with the situations you encounter that they're well-nigh unnoticeable.  There is nothing to jar you out of the the environment, nothing to distract you from the situation you're in.\n\nThe voice acting is absolutely superb.  Of course there are some exceptions, but very few.\n\nTHE VERDICT:\n\nIf you haven't figured out how I feel about the game by now, you must have skipped over the rest of the review!  There's been a lot of hype about the game, and it's all -- in my opinion -- very well-deserved.\n\nIf you're looking for complex gameplay, this isn't for you.  Likewise if you're looking for a lot of combat or a shoot 'em up.  The Walking Dead isn't a game; it's an experience like no other, and one I highly recommend to anyone who loves a good story.\n\nI am dying to play Season 2 -- No, not literally!  Leave my brains intact, please! -- but for now, will have to settle for playing the game through for the third time :D","May 6, 2014","true","40.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","2"

And both of these things I like in spite of the zombies, and not because of them. Other than that, I just plain don't like zombies, and I'm well and thoroughly sick of them crossing over into every medium and genre imaginable. So it means something when I say that The Walking Dead overcomes my zombie hate easily and gets to be the third exception.\n\nAs an adventure game, so far, TWD is no challenge. In fact, I've only stopped because I just hit the first "puzzle" I couldn't immediately solve, and that's probably just because I overlooked something. Gameplay is a mix between point and click, dialogue trees and the occasional quick time event. For those of you who hate QTEs (as well you might): the QTEs presented here are telegraphed well in advance and require little timing skill, so they actually enhance the immersion rather than breaking it from having to replay them over and over again, which is the major problem I have with QTEs.\n\nThe appeal here is the story and not the gameplay, and the way it draws you in is masterfully done. Characters are introduced and you're given reasons to care for them (either positively or negatively) with a minimum of exposition and infodumping -- and that includes you, the protagonist. At the same time, it's clear that the story is driven by you and your actions, and you're not just clicking through to the next cutscene. Does every choice you make matter? Probably not. Is the game adept at making you think it does? Very.\n\nThat's all I can say after 1.5 hours -- but if the rest is as good as what I've already seen, you should absolutely pick this up if you don't mind your games having more story than challenging gameplay. If you play games more for the elements of competition and challenge, though, this game's not going to satisfy you. Likewise, if you're into zombies for the gore or horror, this one probably won't excite you -- blood, severed limbs and strong language are not avoided, but they're not the focus. As interactive entertainment, though, this is great stuff.","May 10, 2014","true","2.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I am one of the "late" gamer who just purchased this game during the 2014 Summer Sale. I already knew that the game did well, but I was not convinced that it is really that perfect. I was completely wrong. The first episode capture my attention and how dialogue choices can affect a player's emotion. You will feel happy when you pick the right choice.

I saw the release of the game originally and expected it to be based on the first series of the TV show, not the graphic novels which I was unaware of, so I watched a few minutes of people streaming it then put it on my list of games to buy some time, no big hurry though. Then about a month ago I watched someone playing a while and remembered I wanted the game and lo and behold Steam put it on sale. I bought it.\n\nSometimes I play a couple of hours of an FPS online and I get tired but it's a physical tiredness, The Walking Dead left me emotionally and mentally drained.

Simply put, I fell in love with this game, and I couldn't stop playing it until I finished my first playthrough. A friend of mine even called me crazy, but he was the one crying when he first played it.\nI just hope you, or anyone else that plays the game, enjoy the game as much as I did (and will, even more).\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of The Walking Dead, season 1.\n\nGameplayYou control a character called Lee, who is a convicted felon, that murdered his wife's lover (wouldn't we all?), and soon you find yourself between a sword and a wall, when a little girl called Clementine comes to your rescue.\nThe story between Lee and Clementine will be the center of TWD: S1, as you meet survivors, some more evil than others, who force you to make decisions that will tailor the game. In the end, you'll not only be crying, but also thinking, "could I've done anything differently?", "could I've saved him/her?". The answer is something you'll have to figure out on your own.\nThe graphics are comic bookish, which sets a nice mood to the game, since The Walking Dead is, in fact, a comic book series.\nThe soundtrack doesn't fall behind, as it feels both smoothing and terrifying, depending on the situation you're facing.\n\nPros Well written story that captivates the player, making the player feel he's part of the story;\nA wide array of choices to help the player choose where his loyalty lies;\nTouching story (a box of tissues should be included with the purchase of the game);\nCaptivating graphics;\nThrilling sountrack;\nAmazing voice acting;\nRealistic display of emotions.\nCons The menu sound is incredibly annoying and repetitive, good thing you don't spend much time there anyway;\nYou can, sometimes, tell when a new "clip" starts, as there's tiny distance from the characters previous position;\nDespite the story being incredibly well written, and the dialogues pretty smooth, there are some parts where if you go back to talk to someone, they just basically say to each other: "Hi", "Hi", "Bye", "Bye". Would be easier to just disable the option to talk to them, like it happens on other bits of the story;\nI saw Katjaa holding Duck, and then for the next minute or so of the story, everytime she appeared she looked like she was holding something, but Duck wasn't anywhere to be seen (a friend of mine told me this also happened to him on a console playthrough).\nVerdictI'd give it a 10/10 as I feel none of the cons/bugs are game breaking, while having a brilliant and touching story.\n\nNote: I wouldn't call myself a fan of the series. I like it, I'll watch it if it's on TV, but it's not something I look forward to watch every week. I feel it got boring after a while. However, the game is a lot better than the series. But that's just my take on it.\n\nPS. I also cried.","April 3, 2015","true","25.3"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArrenDusk/recommended/207610/","ArrenDusk","Arren","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArrenDusk/","1337 products in account","This game is phenomenal and powerful. Very few games take into account the consequence of your actions as seriously as The Walking Dead does. It is quite a bleak experience, don't expect things to be sugarcoated here, the walker threat is real and its impact is felt throughout the whole game.\n\nThe voice acting is top notch, which is a good thing, since this game is entirely plot driven. The characters are all great, you're meant to love some, hate some, and be somewhere in the middle of the road with others. Everyone has their own shades of gray, and the game really sends home the message that morality is secondary when you're purely dealing with survival. Every choice has its outcome, and its advantage along with its disavantage. It's worth replaying just to see how different it can be simply due to the most minor of decisions that you may have taken. It will make you remember each and every "yes" and "no" you have given, whether you like it or not, and you'll feel the full weight of the hard decisions you'll have to do due to circumstances that are, at times, unavoidable, so tread carefully.\n\nIt is a point and click adventure, yes, but not one that gives you obscure clues like some games of this genre do. I personally do not have much experience with point and clicks, and while at first I thought I'd have trouble navigating through it, or even being stuck, I did just fine. It has its quick-time event moments when things get more hectic, and I found it fit the game perfectly.\n\nThis game was again, a powerful, emotional, and unforgettable rollercoaster ride. It also brings out the dad in you and I'll just leave it at that. I need to play Season 2. The Walking Dead belongs in everyone's favorite game list, and I urge you to play this if you haven't yet. You won't come out unchanged.\n\n","August 30, 2014","true","17.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

This game has classic gameplay that can't be really talked about much. There aren't guns here or any machetes. This isn't Left 4 Dead.\n\nThis grabs the comic books and says: "Alright, remember when zombie slaughter is cool in the TV Show and fanboys don't shut about how awesome it is to chop heads off and look at Daryl's marvelously awesome hair of badassness? Well ♥♥♥♥ all that! We want to tell a story, like a true zombie game should tell, about the desperation of the survivors in a world lost to a virus that came out of nowhere!"\n\nAnd it succeeded at that. More so than the TV show. I now want more Telltale TWD Games. Not the TV Show.\n\nThe TV Show kinda sold it's soul. You start 1st and 2nd season with what? Oh right, zombies, desperation and survival.\n\n"- Guys, this ♥♥♥♥'s giving more money than Brazil gave to the stadium contructions for the World Cup 2014! We gotta do more seasons!"\n\n"- Sir?!"\n\n"- Yes, Zach?"\n\n"- Uhh, I think zombies are becoming repetitive by now and the fans would be sick of zombies in a 3rd and 4th season..."\n\n"- Well, ain't this a zombie TV Show?"\n\n"- Ehhh...Good point, Sir! But I think we should add variety! How about add a generic villain and make this another TV Show about turf wars?"\n\n"- Uhmm... Interesting, Zach, and what about the zombies?"\n\n"- ♥♥♥♥'em, Sir! We'll slap some Microsoft Paint background in there and we focus on the gun on gun action between humans! No one will expect that! It's like a plot twist!"\n\n"- Heh...good idea!" (After 5 minutes) - "Yo! I just wrote the script for the next 2 seasons, print this ♥♥♥♥ and give it to the actors!"\n\n*A lot of $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ later...*\n\nIt became so boring and no longer unique. They are just rolling this into a big snow ball that will never end! It was so cool before, about true survival. Not anymore. Now it's like Dragon Ball of some ♥♥♥♥! About looking badass n' stuff...\n\nUgh anyways. I'm happy to report the game is the true return to the Walking Dead. This game is 90% story focused with conversations and decision making. Like an RPG, where you Role-Play.\n\nGameplay's far from an RPG though. It's like a traditional point n' click adventure. Mixing items and solving some issues/obstacles along the way. Very simple and it's even simpler in the game. The puzzles are very easy and dont require much Einstein thinking.\n\nThe star is the characters. You play as Lee Everett, a convicted felon for murder who has a car crash on his way to jail. He then heads to a home to get assistance. He then meets a lovely little girl alone at home. Clementine's her name.\n\nA huge journey then starts! With you protecting Clementine from anything that resembles a threat. A journey about emotions and hard decisions for you to make. It exhibits shock to the point of the player suffering true disgust and his/her stomach turned upside-down (Oh man... chapter 2. Holy...)\n\nAnyways I'll cut down to the chase. This is the best storyline in a video game ever! I've been gaming for over 12 ♥♥♥♥ing years! This game in the end accumulated everything you build up through your 10-12 single player campaign to deliver the most hardcore and blood-pressure increasing ending I've had the pleasure of witnessing. Everything ended with some suspense and at the same time, a satisfying sense of conclusion. And then the credits rolled...\n\nI couldn't see them well to be honest...\n\n":O, why?"\n\nBecause my eyes were covered in tears... yeah... I cried like a ♥♥♥♥♥ in the end and I am 100% proud of that. It proves games can tell emotional stories no other entertainment type can. You can't get this related to a character unless you play as them in a video game! Also proves I'm human! So... it killed 2 birds in one stone...\n\nThat was the ultimate proof of success of it's storytelling. And I will never forget this game nor stop recommending this as much as I humanly can.\n\nThere isn't much to talk about tbh. Voice acting is superb. Plot Twists and bat-♥♥♥♥ awesome. The ending is... no words can be said because no word exists to describe it well enough...\nGraphics are looking for the comic book look. And it succeeds. It tried to get the look right (which it got) and not to get Crysis 3 PC-Melting 1080p 3D Looking grass!\n\nProblems... ehhh... some bugs. I got stuttering issues on the first chapter. A huge bug/glitch on the second chapter. Game-breaking I'd say. But I managed to get it fixed, just restart a checkpoint or wait for the bug "to run away".\nAlso, some choices seem like they matter. LOLNOPE. Some give you the (well done) illusion of choice, when if fact: you don't have it. You really don't. I would say it's quite disappointing.\n\nBut as a (semi) linear story. It's perfect, it really is... Oh look, this review is huge again! I really can't control myself...\n\nAnyways, my final score is an 8/10 and I will go against common knowledge that score is what mattersin a review. Because it doesn't. it only appeals to those math/score nerds (like me). The Walking Dead is my personal Game of The year of 2012, even though other candidates have much higher scores of 9's and 9.5's.\n\nSo go wild! Grab the money you saved for your rent or your girlfriend's engagement ring and get this right now!","September 12, 2014","true","13.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Well, scratch away, people, because Telltale Games has you covered with this episodic title.  Basically, in a nutshell, the game is a dialogue heavy, decision based platform with a few quick-time event sequences in them.  While it's compared to Heavy Rain, The Walking Dead has strengths over Heavy Rain, and vice versa.  The decisions in The Walking Dead feel like they have a much greater impact on the story than Heavy Rain, however, the QTE sequences in Heavy Rain are extremely intense and failing them has great consequences.  In The Walking Dead, QTE failure just makes you restart it, so literally nothing is at stake during them and they feel like padding.  In the end, The Walking Dead is a very absorbing title for those who enjoy games with decision making over action, and is well worth the price.","August 21, 2012","true","48.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","2"

Yet, I was only tempted into buying The Walking Dead by its namesake Pinball FX2 table where scoring choices declared that I'd chosen to 'save' one person or another (I just wanted to find out what all that was about...).  How mistaken I was to think this was some kind of zombie FPS!\n\nFor fellow gamers who hate zombies, let me put this out there: this game is not actually about zombies.  With a title of "The Walking Dead" and a zillion screenshots of, well, zombies - I might sound like I'm off my rocker here, but no.  An unexplained disease outbreak has suddenly taken place (you never get to find out what, how or why in the game) which results in the dead returning to devour the flesh of anything they can grab (yep, sounds suspiciously zombie-like, doesn't it?) but this is really just the backdrop to the storyline.  The backdrop event could equally be about a nuclear holocaust, or some killer virus outbreak (kinda not far off this story actually).  It is the events caused by this cataclysmic, life-changing backdrop that you play through.  The game is a story-rich masterpiece about survival.  You will constantly be presented with moral choices and difficult dilemmas.  Do you trust fellow survivors or not?  Do you depend on them?  Do you let a threat live?  Do you let compassion rule over logic?  Do you be honest or withold the brutal truth from a child?  In truth, you might do a little of all these things because this is a game with very few rights versus wrongs.  There is little point flipping through walk-throughs in hope of pursuing the perfect game.  It simply doesn't work like that.  You will be presented with tear-jerking choices where neither is great, but you HAVE to choose.  Heartbreaking moments surface throughout - so all but the most hardened of players might appreciate a box of Kleenex by their side!  This game is very much the 8-person lifeboat scenario where you forever always seem to have 9 people.  Who goes?  YOU decide.  But not everyone can live happily ever after and life is not always fair...\n\nI don't know how true to the comics the game happens to be, but I will say that the characters were very easy to care about (even the dislikeable ones had a story), the artwork is novel and effective (somehow 3D without losing the water-colour comic essence), and the haunting melodic music throughout sets the tone for the dark storyline perfectly.  The game plays well with both keyboard/mouse and gamepad and doesn't require a ninja PC to play it (which is always nice).  There are no pointless 'collectibles' missions to detract from the story and no quick-save options to dilute the pressure of the instant-decision process (though for busy people it is never-the-less possible to rewind back to an earlier point if part of the story is missed).\n\nFor anyone who enjoys a great story-driven adventure built strongly upon the choices you make throughout each episode, this game is the real deal.  If you want a game where what you do really seems to matter, and where a few shocks and anguishes won't be too distressing, then I highly recommend this game.","November 14, 2014","true","44.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

These decisions make the story feel like it is your own, allowing you to shape Lee and his relationship with Clementine and the other characters, and I felt this resulted in it having more of an impact on me than if I had watched it on TV.\n\nThe characters are well developed and felt real, many becoming people for whom I cared (and still think about) and it hurt to see them suffer during what were intense and sometimes devastating scenes. Oftentimes I found myself questioning my decisions, regardless of how justifiable they seemed. But while the story is pretty grim at times, there are touching moments as well, particularly during the interactions with Clementine, who is the heart and soul of the game.\n\nExpect to get around 2-4 hours per episode depending if you inspect everything and exhaust all dialogue options.

What do we, as those interacting with the medium, hope to walk away with when we let go of the mouse and keyboard at the end of a gaming session?  The answer is simple, but it is often difficult to achieve in most games.  We play games to attempt to grasp a sense of accomplishment and connection with the story that we just dedicated precious time to accomplishing. Telltale Games’  The Walking Dead  provides the player with a definitive sense of satisfaction and concern for the story laid out over the course of five episodes.  An expertly crafted story guided by Telltale Games, but shaped by each individual player, guides the narrative of  The Walking Dead .  Set in a sudden and bleak zombie apocalypse, players assume the role of Lee Everett as he embarks on an emotionally powerful endeavor to survive in this new world whilst still holding on to what little sense of humanity can be grasped. The ageless formula and storytelling abilities of the “point and click” genre has achieved a near-perfection in every episode of  The Walking Dead .  At moments, controls can become finicky such as when navigating the main character, Lee Everett, around tight spaces, but this shortcoming in control is easily forgotten as the narrative itself of  The Walking Dead  slowly build up momentum and gathers the attention of all who have the chance to enjoy the game.\n\nPositives:\nThe sense of personalization to the story and connection with the characters felt by the player in  The Walking Dead  is rarely found in gaming today.\nEpisode 5: “No Time Left” instantly ranks amongst the most powerful moments in all of gaming.\nEven the smallest decisions made seem to come back and appear later on in the game as both minor references and also major repercussions.\nMusical score is equally as powerful as the writing of the story itself.\nThe multitude of different endings possible leave for a very high replay value. Negatives:\nControls can become tough to operate at times, but these moments were rare and few and lasted for only a brief few seconds.\nPacing can become slow at some instances in the story, particular in Episode 3: "Long Road Ahead."  This by no means takes away form the overall experience of playing  The Walking Dead , but at points, momentary issues with pacing become prevalent. Summary:\n\nTelltale Games’  The Walking Dead  is a rarity in gaming today.  The connection developed and nurtured with the cast and their plight in the game begins instantly from the first moment and carries with the player through to the rolling of the final credits.  Support Telltale Games’ near masterpiece and download  The Walking Dead  today.\n\nOverall Score:\n\n9.5 out of 10.0","August 12, 2014","true","26.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's wonderful, i can tell without a doubt that it's one of the best games i ever played in my entire life. It's an interactive story in a zombie-apocalypse universe, where all your choices will influence the events and the final. Yup, it's that kind of story.  And not a simple story, but a well written story, with well done characters and above all, an EMOTIONAL story. Because, let's face it, this game not only has an intuitive and enjoyable gameplay and a great story, but it even offers a series of emotions that leave its mark, if you LIVE fully the game. And they remain with you. It's simply perfect. 10/10, and i would forget it just to play it again. (Sorry for my bad english.)\n\nItaliano:\n\nSeriamente, compralo e basta.

It's amazing what this game can cause on you.\n5. Don't worry about money, it's worth it, the best game you can buy.\n\nWell... This game was really incredible, when I bought I didn't even know what I was going to play, I mean, I thought this would be another game more for my library but when I started playing it I realized the story was catching me slowly, I mean, every minute spent in game it's awesome, you want more and more, you don't wanna stop.\n\nI've seen some reviews where people trash talk about this game just because they think "This isn't a game", they actually say that due to this isn't a FPS game or maybe because it doesn't look like any other survival game, this is more like a graphic adventure which is simply amazing, I love FPS games, even the games where I've spent more time have been FPS and survival games like Killing Floor because I really love them just that you have to be objective, that's the reason you need to be aware if you read one of those reviews, do not pay attention, that's trash, what you really need to do it's to buy this game, play it then write a review. I almost forget, certainly this isn't a game, this is more than just a game.\n\nAbout the game characteristics, I really liked the facial movements, I mean, when they smile, they're worried, they're afraid or when they are angry or whatever they are, I mean, I have to say that "Tell Tales Games" did a great job here, you can feel what the characters feel, the enviroment is pretty good, the voices are amazing, I think it could be one of the first facts which make amazing and cause a lot of emotions through the game. There's just one thing I didn't like and well... it's funny because this game was so good that even my mother played it and she doesn't know much about English and we played it with Spanish subtitles and there were some gramar errors, no big deal but you know, sometimes that's annoying, I guess who translated this game was a native English speaker who studied Spanish or something like that, it was't so many errors but it's just a suggestion.\n\nIf you thought there wasn't anyone like Rick Grimes...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/207610/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","The Walking Dead is an adventure game by Telltale Games Studios best known for developing episodic games, such as Sam & Max, Wallace & Gromit, Tales of Monkey Island, Back to the Future, and Jurassic Park. The game is based on the award-winning comic book series created by Robert Kirkman, entitled The Walking Dead.\n\nThe game is split into episodes that make up seasons, just like a TV show. The main protagonist of the first season of The Walking Dead is Lee Everett. The story begins at the outbreak of zombie apocalypse, at the time when Rick Grimes (the protagonist of the comic) is in coma. When the infection begins its bloody harvest, Lee is sitting handcuffed at the backseat of a police car. He was arrested for murdering a man who slept with his wife. The developers decided to present adventures of an entirely new group of people, while the major inspiration in the creation process was Robert Kirkman’s work, which is regarded by the developers as the canonical version of the story. Players can visit places and meet characters well-known from the comic books and learn additional information about them. The first season of the game is divided into five episodes. Completing each takes on average about two hours.\n\nThe gameplay mainly consists of exploration, conducting conversations, collecting items, and solving puzzles. From time to time there are also simple action sequences, but it is worth noting that QTE (quick time events) do not play such an important role in this game, as they did in the previous production from Telltale Games - Jurassic Park. In contrast to a typical zombie game, The Walking Dead is not about exterminating hordes of undead. The developers decided on a slower-paced gameplay, and players need to keep quiet, especially in places where the walking dead like to roam.\n\nThe Walking Dead is the first game from Telltale, in which decisions made by the players influence the experience. What you do in the first episode has consequences later in the story. It is worth noting that players have a limited time to make a decision and do not have a chance to carefully reflect on possible repercussions. When it comes to puzzles that you encounter in the game, they do not resemble “adventure game-like problems”, but reflect the reality of a zombie apocalypse. The creators also saw to it that the environment was interactive, so to provided players with more freedom when solving puzzles.\n\nThe title has attractive, cartoon-like graphics, slightly resembling the comic books by Robert Kirkman. The game does not feature multiplayer mode and is distributed only via digital means.\n\n9.4/10","October 10, 2015","true","37.7"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

I've never been a fan of point and click games but I am a fan of rich singleplayer stories and that is what this game delivers\n\n+Gorgeous cell-shaded art style\n+A compelling story\n+Unrivalled story telling\n+Amazing voice acting\n+Five episodes each around two hours long\n+The choices you make have consequences on the rest of the game, sometimes minute, sometimes massive\n+Very interesting characters who have rich backstories\n+At the end of each episode you can compare your choices with others who have played the game\n+Less focus on zombies, more focus on the people who you meet meaning you quickly become attached\n+The most heart-wrenching ending to a game I have ever encountered\n\n+/-Most of the gameplay comes from looking around or quick time events but if you're here for gameplay you're in the wrong place\n\nVerdict:\n10\n\nEasily one of my all-time favourite games.

And after that, now I am recommending it myself.\n\nSo this game is based on The Walking Dead comic books, and something that I really like about it too is how the graphics of the game follows the theme of comic art, which I found to be great. You can see even if the characters aren’t talking, the expressions on their face show their emotions. I really thought that was great. The sound effects are amazing, and always keep you focused on the game and make it that little bit more realistic (and can make you jump as well even if you’re not paying full attention).\n\nThe game gets you from the moment you start it. You go on a journey through tragedy, fear, pressure, suspense, sadness… the list goes on. If you play this game and don’t get emotionally attached or feel any sort of these emotions I’d be surprised. 	Speaking of surprises the game is full of them, it’s unexpected, and some things that happen in the game will leave you shocked. The gameplay is simple, and the game itself is kind of like a movie, and when prompted you follow the instructions given. I like how the story is based on the decisions you make yourself, which is just another reason why I loved this game.\n\nThere isn’t much else to say, all I’d suggest now is grabbing a copy of this game and a box of tissues and enjoy yourself!\n✮✮✮✮✮","February 12, 2014","true","13.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peachheadquarters/recommended/207610/","peachheadquarters","Mands","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peachheadquarters/","5 products in account","The Walking Dead was one of the first games I was introduced to on Steam. I hadn’t ever played a game quite like this one. Before playing The Walking Dead, in my eyes games were limited to Pac-Man, platformers like Mario, multiplayer racing games, Zoo Tycoon, etc. I never really experienced a “choose your own adventure” game before, and prior to playing this game.. I wasn’t really all that interested in trying one either.\n\nAlthough I went into this game kicking and screaming, an episode or two in, I was hooked. I was not a huge fan of the blood and gore, but that aside, the story was very inviting. I truly felt as if I was making all of the major decisions in the game, therefore influencing how my character, as well as all those around me would turn out in the end. I grew attached to some characters (Ben) that took me on an emotional journey at times, which was interesting to me, because I never knew that games could get you to feel such emotional ties to a fictional character.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, this game lets YOU decide how you want to play the game. You could play as the hero, or the villain. You can choose to leave people behind, and you can choose to save peoples lives. The most interesting part of the game is seeing how your choices you make earlier in the game can influence how your games pans out 2 or 3 episodes down the line.\n\nYou start out the game as a man named Lee. You do not know much about Lee, but you soon start to see his backstory unfold. He may have a criminal background, but you can choose whom, if anyone, you want to share this information with as you begin to make bonds and partnerships with people. You later run into a little girl named Clementine. You learn she is currently on her own when something terrible happened to her babysitter when her parents went out on a trip. You and Clementine team up and try to escape the monsters that seem to be taking over the area. She reminds you time and time again that the main goal is to find and reunite her with her family, until then, you are her guardian. The things you two will encounter and defeat together give you two an almost inseparable bond. You two start to learn things about each other not many people may know, which will help you in the end when you have to make some major life altering choices. You will meet a number of other survivors, victims, and criminals along your journey together. You will have to make decisions on who you trust and don’t trust, and hope that the people you do bring along for the ride will have your back when it counts.\n\nJust remember that ALL of the choices you make, whether they are big or small will have some sort of repercussion. Some decisions you will have to make in a split second, and others you will have a little more time to think about.. but all your decisions are very important. Even though you may not always be able to save everyone from death and destruction, you have to remember your main goal is to keep Clementine safe. This is another layer to the game that makes all of your choices in the long run an emotional journey. Just when you think that you feel you’ve gotten away with something, remember you will have her watching you from the sidelines, learning to act just as you do.\n\nI hope you do give this game a fair try. There is a reason it has been so successful, the writers do know what they are doing. The artwork is different which makes gameplay enjoyable. Even though you are placed in a time period that may be depressing and hopeless, the graphics somehow make you almost feel a glimpse of hope to reach for. Being an apocalyptic type game, there is a fair share of blood and guts, but most times it is safe to turn your head and look away for a slit second. Embrace this different form of gameplay and open your eyes to the new experiences and emotions that will rapidly unfold when you play this game.","January 9","true","15.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

A lot of reviews have said similar things but game's strength is in its story and character development, which is absolutely top notch.\n\nYou play a character Lee who is trying to survive the zombie apocalypse with a young girl named Clementine. As the story progresses, your relationship with the girl you are protecting and other characters grow. It makes the decisions in the story feel important and consequential.\n\nI won't spoil anything, but I loved the story. Episode 2 was especially epic and the ending was a really heartfealt conclusion.\n\nThe one criticism I have is that compared to the old games I've played such as Still Life and Monkey Island, the puzzles are not difficult at all. That really doesn't take away from the game at all because the story makes you want to progress through it all quickly. It also has an effect on the length of the game since harder games take longer to explore and finish.\n\nThe cell-shaded cartoony graphics are suitable and look great on the game.\n\nI expect this game is pretty genre-defining for new adventure games. Overall it's a good thing. There's potential for games with great and compelling stories. There is more replay value in these games because you feel like playing them again and making different decisions. However, I think puzzle aspect has been downgraded. I think I can live with this compromise and I'm now really looking forward to playing more like the Wolf Among Us and Game of Thrones.","January 16","true","17.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

As a huge fan of the tv-series, I wondered how the game would turn out to be. Would it be another gore- and slaughter-festival, and how would they manage to incorporate the grim feeling of the series into a game?\n\nThe answer to this is simple: TellTaleGames came out with a trump card, by casting this game as an interactive story. It's not about gore, not about fast and furious action, not about mashing buttons and quick reflexes (although there a some mild action scenes here and there). No, the whole idea is: you are the protagonist in a world where Walkers have taken over, and you have to make choices in order to survive. Choices: that's where this game is all about. Some trivial ones, some which have to be made fast (the time you have to decide is often limited), and some totally impossible and even heart-breakingly difficult. And what's more: it's often impossible to tell beforehand how the choice you make will influence the game and the story.\n\nSeldom have I felt so emotionally involved into a game. After a couple of chapters and especially by the second episode (there are six of them, all good for a couple of hours of gameplay), I was completely into this game, feeling connected to the main character and to the little girls he has vowed to protect. Form that moment on, this was no longer a floating gaming experience, no, it was more lke reading a gripping book, but with an extra: the ability of steering the story to a limited way.

If you are having doubts about whether or not you're a cold hearted son of a b**ch then play this game and by the end you will know.\n\nThis game is a masterpiece.\nWhen I first heard about The walking dead game I thought that it sounded rather dull and that "How much fun can one have just clicking on stuff?"\nThen my friend said to me recently that I would love the walking dead and to give it a shot. So I took his word for it and got it.\nThe first 30 minutes of the game didn't really captivate me and I began to have regrets but decided I needed to just get through the first chapter before I made my decision. Boy was I wrong, around 31 minutes into the game something happened which turned a switch on in my brain and made me really like what was going on.\nFrom the second chapter onward the game just kept getting better, the plot kept thickening, the decisions got tougher and you learn to love (or hate) the characters!\nDon't let the fact that this is a point and click game fool you, until you have played it and began to understand the story and build your characters personality you really have no idea what this game is about.\nSure if you don't like point and click styled games and you don't like zombies or you don't like having your heart torn into a trillion pieces then maybe this game isn't for you.\nFor the rest of you do yourselves a favor and get this at the next steam sale!\n\n+Voice acting\n+Beautiful graphics\n+Amazing characters\n+Zombies\n+Best story I have ever experienced in a game\n\n-Not all decisions seem totally relevant\n-Can make you feel depressed\n\n9.5/10","March 9, 2014","true","20.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

I thought the music was lacking, I felt the characters were shallow.\n\nWhen I was mid-way through, I was hooked, I felt that someone had touched my heart, I was shocked about some of the scenes, I had built up new friendships, I had glanced at love and I were curious about the future.\n\nWhen I finished the game, I sat empty, yet my mind was filled with new wonderful things. I cried, not only from loneliness, but from happiness and fulfillment. I was ready to let it go, yet something inside of me wished for more.\n\nIf I would have missed out on this game, I would not have been as complete as I am today.

There are some flaws such as the illusion of choice at some places (you can't change the main script event), not very much of a gameplay itself (mostly QTE and choosing between 3 variants of an answer), but these flaws don't spoil the whole impression you get when you play the game.\n\nI am not a fan of TV show Walking dead (watched a few episodes, didn't like them) and I haven't read the novel, so I didn't know what to expect from the game. But when I started it, I fell in love. Telltale games can really tell the tale, the story is the main core of the game.The characters are alive, they have personalities. My favourite is of course Clementine. She's just a child who becomes grown up having seen bad things happen throughout the whole story.\n\nThere are some genuinely funny moments, but the most memorable are the tragic ones. Honestly, I almost cried during one of them.\n\nThe game uses cell-shading style, and I think it really suits here. The game is based on graphic novel, so it looks like one.\n\nAll in all, it's one of the best stories I have ever played. 10 out of 10.\n\nP.S. What concerns DLC 400 days. It's a good addition to the first season, as you meet a few familiar faces. And I know that it is a bridge between 1st and 2nd seasons, but as a standalone game it isn't worth it.

The storyline is amazing, with the interaction between characters more than stunning. An explanation can't really do it justice. While the gameplay is not the main aspect there is enough interactivity and thinking for what it's worth. While some people have debated over how much of an impact your decisions have on the overall game, it is still a part of the game either way, and one that is particularly enjoyable. Some people complain when a game is like a movie, but the way I see it that is one of the highest compliments you could give, that an interactive art form made for a certain entertainment has enough in it to qualify as another, one that when done right creates an equally as amazing experience. Now, I have not seen or read anything else pertaining to The Walking Dead, but I can assure you Telltale did an amazing job with whatever it is they were given. In one aspect this is an emotional journey, at another it is an exciting adventure, fun to be a part of. The entire time, however, it is at the very least enjoyable.

As opposed to the majority of adventure titles of the past, this one includes branching storylines and accomodates to your choices.\n\nThe nature of the choices you're expected to make in The Walking Dead are often difficult and tragic. This ISN'T the feel good title where you chew through hordes of zombies with reckless abandon. There are consequences for your words and actions. Other characters will remember whether you acted in their interests or not.\n\nThe characters themselves are all well written and voice acted. Interacting with them is one of the main draws of this game. You really feel for these characters and it makes some decisions harder and some seemingly easy, though you will have to live with the consequences.\n\nThe game is rendered in an art style that resembles a comic book in 3D. Here in lies my one problem with the game. The art style itself is not the problem, but sometimes you'll see lines that represent creases in the characters clothes levitating above their shoulders. It is detracting from the immersion, but it's an extremely minor problem.\n\nThis game is extremely replayable, especially if you're intreiged to see what happens if you chose your decisions differently.\n\nIf you've been avoiding this title because it has zombies in it then you may have missed the point. The situation this game puts you in is the point and the story couldn't be told in any other way. This is different than most zombie games where if you changed the assets from zombies to anything else it wouldn't make a difference.\n\nIf you're looking for something that is dark, tragic and challenges your ability to reason in tough situations then I think this is the game you're looking for.","November 28, 2014","true","12.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The people at TellTale knew how to draw their gamers into their game and make them feel connected to the characters.\n-Gameplay: Overall the gameplay was pretty good.

You can make decisions and really emphasize with your character. Everything is more emotional than in series. I would describe this game as an interactive series.\n\nNow, this game knows how to capture you with it's story perfectly. The emotions come over quite well and will capture you. To make out what is the best thing to do you emphasize with all the persons around you. In a situation of danger you have to make heavy decisions and these effect the people around you. If someone doesn't like you he won't help you, for example.\nOf course you can not change the whole story with your acting but you can decide about life and death of your company, directly and indirectly.\n\nPlaying this game means tension all the time. You are always scared about whether someone dies or not or whether you die or not.\n\nFurthermore, there is the action part of the game. Sometimes you have to shoot some zombies or click somewhere fast to react to another person. These quicktime events are a cool variety and give the game the last polish.\n\nTo sum up, I totally want to recommend buying this game. Just everything is fine in this game: the story, the emotions, the effects of your acting... It's an awesome interactive story that is going to capture you soon. And if you like The Walking Dead anyways you shall not miss this magnificent zombie game.","November 11, 2014","true","18.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

На протяжении игры не раз придется столкнуться с неоднозначным выбором, от которого будет зависеть жизнь ваших спутников.

The relationship between these two during the game is just fantastic! If you love good stories, godo characters or good atmosphere pick this game up! It is linear but it works for the better in a game like this. There is also alot of hard choices to be made that will have you trying to decide which one to pick.

I'm going to tell you right now, this is not a game you're going to play for gameplay, action or whatever. This is a game you're going to play for the story, which is the main focus. Think of this more as a interactive movie, or even more accurately , a show.  Gameplay is a relatively similar to other PaCs, though there are some very minor differences such as more focus dialogue and story.\n\nA short, spoiler-freeish summary of the story:\n\nYou're  Lee Everett, a former professor of history at the University of Georgia who, for reasons I'll let you find out, was heading to jail...on the day of the apocalypse. However, you didn't make it. You later find a little 8 year old girl named Clementine, alone, and you decide to take care of her. This where the main point of the game comes in; Keeping safe, and taking care of Clementine, who you will end up caring about a lot.\n\n\nTelltale does a amazing job of making you care about Clementine, a game as never made Me as emotionally invested in characters as The Walking Dead does.\n\nThere are, however, a few small performance issues and graphical bugs, but I found turning off AA(Anti-aliasing), setting shadows to low and having it run as administrator fixed most of the problems.\n\nI would go into more about the games story and all that, but I really don't want to spoil to much.\n\nPlease just trust Me, buy this game, and it's DLC 400 Days. Even if you don't want to pay full price, then wait for a sale and ♥♥♥♥ing get it then!\n\nI promise you, you will not regret it!\n\nIf I had to do a stupid score thing, I would give this game a 9.9/10 and 400 Days DLC a 5.5/10\n=======================================\n\n[Updated My review]\n\nAfter playing through season 2, I'm going to change My rating for 400 Days from a 8.7 to 5.5/10 and would also say that you could skip it, as choices you make in it are, in season 2 at least, pointless, and most of the characters, minus Bonnie, have nothing more then pointless cameos.","October 30, 2014","true","18.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This point-and-click adventure game features excellent character development and a well-paced plot which serves to maximize immersion. Even if you are not familiar with the Walking Dead in other mediums (i.e. the TV show or comics), you will find yourself attached to the characters in this game. Every heart-wrenching decision you make has consequences, some large, some small, and you will often find yourself wondering if you made the right choice.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that this is not an action game. Don't look to this game for any sort of combat or survival mechanics. The purpose of the game is to tell a story, and it is an amazing narrative about love, loss and morality.

Possibility of it sounds for me really stupid - especially in our modern world with our GPS systems, payment purchases through fingerprints and fast Internet on the space station. But this game changed my opinion about zombies, because:\n1. This game magnificently shows you, how hard it is - to kill a zombie, which 10 minutes ago was a human with his own feelings, wishes, thoughts and memories.\n2. After 2-3 hours of game process you start thinking: who's worse - people or zombies, because all of them do awful things.\nAbout the game itself - it's brilliant. There isn't so much action, the whole game process is just point'n'click and sometimes QTE (with choosing phrases in dialogues). But the story and characters are wonderful. I would also like to note voices of characters, especially Clementine. Voices...well...impossible to describe it, actors did their best.\nStrongly recommended for:\n1. people, who want to see excellent story in the game\n2. people who like zombie apocalypse\n3. people who don't like zombie apocalypse (they will change their mind, as I did)\nimho, 10/10","September 28, 2013","true","18.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","3"

The graphics are cartoony and the game has great sound quality, effects, soundtrack and voice acting.\n\nIt's the storyline and script that the game shines, thoroughly engaging and captivating, a story in which you must make choices that impact during the game and in relations with the characters, there impactful moments when it is impossible not to be touched, addition to all is the construction of the characters, their qualities, defects and emotions is perfect, the immersive factor is present in a unique way in this game.\n\nThe DLC is a good length, although short, sets the stage for the second season, I have to say I enjoyed the game much more than the series, I highly recommend it to everyone, even those who don't have much interest in this kind of game.\n\n9/10","May 5, 2014","true","17.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

But the game is not universally adored. If you are like me, you see through the thin veneer that covers an extremely linear story that requires hardly any player interaction. This is more a movie with some light choices than a game.\n\nOn the surface, the game seems to give you choices that change the storyline. The game actually claims that that is the case. However, if you rewind a bit and replay a part of the game in a different way, you will find that the story is on railroad tracks and there is nothing that you can do to change it. Your choices hardly matter.\n\nTo give an example (light spoiler alert): in the first episode you will have to choose between two characters, one of whom will die, while the other will go with you to the next episode. It sounds like that has a huge impact on the story, but the fact of the matter is that after this choice that particular character hardly features in the story anymore. You might find it an agonizing choice (will I save A or B?), but for the story the choice is moot.\n\nSo I guess, to appreciate this game, you must be so deeply immersed into it that you believe that your choices actually shape the game. Unfortunately, the game does its utmost to destroy the immersion -- namely through quick time events (with, I might add, very awkward and not re-mappable controls for left-handed players). The game is full of them, and after you have lost one, you rewind and have to replay a bit of the story, because they are all of the "press X not to die" quality. The QTE's seem like a desparate attempt to introduce some gameplay into the borderline-movie, but it is gameplay that should have been avoided.\n\nAdd to that the issue that very often you cannot actually make the choices that you would want to make. For instance (another light spoiler): when a character gets stuck in a bear trap while zombies are approaching, you cannot leave him behind or give him a merciful death -- no, you have to chop off his leg. Because that has been written in the story, and you only get options that end up with you chopping off a leg. And you cannot even go for the leg directly, no, you first have to go through several other possibilities that do not work before the game allows you to sink an axe into a poor guy's lower extremities. That's choice for you.\n\nNow, the story is reasonably good (for a zombie-fest, that is), which could have led to me giving it a thumbs-up. Unfortunately, the game is marred by very serious bugs. Extremely serious bugs. Namely bugs that involve your savegames. It happened to me several times that upon restarting the game, I was returned not to the point where I left the game, but to a previous episode. At one point I was even returned to episode one, while I was halfway episode three. And if I tried to go to episode three the game generated completely different choices for me than I had made.\n\nI looked around the web, and found that many people suffer from this problem. The game has been out for years and it still isn't solved. This particular problem destroys the fundamentals of the game -- if your choices are supposed to matter, the game should save them for you.  Had they allowed manual savegames, at least there was a work-around, but nooooo -- autosaves are the only thing you get.\n\nSo I cannot recommend this game. I even cannot recommend it as an interactive story. You might like it, but realize what you are getting into: a book told by means of cutscenes. A book with lots of printing errors and some pages stuck together.

Right now. This game is a favorite of mine. There are some elements taken from the comicbook but it wouldn't be called "The Walking Dead" if they didn't keep true to some of the things going on in the original.\n\nTWD gives the phrase "between a rock and a hard place" a meaning. You are constantly getting thrown into difficult situations where the direction of the story and the relationships you maintain are dependent on the decisions you make. Many games have tried this style of narrative but they fall flat on more than one aspect or another (ex: Heavy Rain). Because I feel this game is nearly flawless and because I know Telltale is listening to their audience's critiques, I have high hopes for the second installment and anticipate on another emotionally harrowing/rewarding game.\n\nThere are very few games that are able to fully immerse their audience into their stories and characters. Some people complain about the lack of button mashing and zombie smashing. To them I say, "You have a very narrow view of what a game should be." Like movies, shows, and books, games don't always have to be fun to be games—and this game is not fun by any means. Entertaining, yes. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will be engaged but you will not have fun. It's a drama; it shouldn't be a problem for anyone seeing as how neither the show nor the comicbook would be described as "fun."\n\nAnother complaint that gets coupled with the lack of button mashing that I'd like to rebut is that the player isn't playing and instead, they're watching a film. Yes, you are more or less watching the story but TWD is an interactive game that Telltale does masterfully. Had you simply watched it as a film and had no role in the decision-making, do you think you'd feel the same way about the story and the characters? No, you wouldn't. In the show/comicbook, I didn't give a rat's ♥♥♥ about Rick or most of the characters. This game made me sympathetic toward characters I only knew for a few seconds and characters whose names I'd never know. The game requires interaction rather than just observation. This marriage between you and the mechanics is what makes the struggle for survival more rewarding than most games, let alone any zombie media.\n\nThe only criticism I really have is the poor choice in the voice actress for Clementine, a core character in the narrative. It felt inauthentic and forced. I know it's not a child's voice acting and I'm reminded of it half the time she speaks. However, it doesn't affect the character's personality and significance in the story.\n\nYou will think back on your choices that can open up for a lot of different types of discussion with others—something not a lot of games can manage to do. Some people may even do a little bit of personal reflection. All I know is that your body is not ready but the human experience will be worth it. I promise.\n\n10/10","January 22, 2013","true","36.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

Yes I watched all the seasons and I think the whole story is crap, how the characters behave, they all act like idiots or teenagers with a lot of hormones on them, everything that happens is stupid and you can't believe it I cannot feel attach or care with any of the characters because they are idiots and do stupid things, they are always putting themselves on risky situations for nothing. Here in the game on the other hand it's just as real as it gets (well sometimes you will find silly things but they are very scarce throughout the game), your main protagonist acts like a real human ADULT guy and the choices you made are really hard ones and they do carry consequences in both long and short term. You will end up caring for the characters.\nYou will hate some characters and love others, but all of them behave like real people!\nThe voice acting is superb!\nThis game is a must game, BUY IT you won't regret it.\n\nThe bad: Well the game is very poor optimized, don't know if it's the engine or what but it will hang between scenes for a few seconds, it's really annoying.\nThe save system is not the best either, it will save from time to time (always on the same parts) so lets say you made a choice but you dont like it and want to load and try it again...well bad luck for you, sometimes you will have to play 30min...\nYou can't skip the dialogs.

(most of the time the games picks to not say anything at all on those cases) Happened to me 1 time on the entire game but It felt like the game was forcing me to take an answer and maybe with more time to think about it I would picked other and not that one.","May 2, 2014","true","14.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/caniterrae/recommended/207610/","caniterrae","Cani Terrae","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caniterrae/","245 products in account","// Review - Introduction //\n\nI've been playing PC games long enough to remember the days of the first point-and-click adventure games, and story-driven fmv games with minimal UI.  I enjoyed them for what they were; similar to those interactive novels that once were popular; making a choice and seeing how it affects the story is rewarding. It is with distinct gusto, then, that I herald Telltale Games as the single best developer for this type of genre that I have ever witnessed.  They have single-handedly resurrected and revolutionized the concept of a story-driven game, and I am awed at the compelling drama that is The Walking Dead: Season One.\n\n// Story - Immersion //\n\nThis is the number one thing I care about in a story-driven game, as might make sense; Telltale manages to give you meaningful choices; that affect the outcomes of who lives and who dies.  There are many times where you can't prevent a death, however, as the story must go on.  They can't write an outcome for every single possibility, sadly.  But I never found that the linear progression was anything other than...immersive.  Sublime.  Surreal.  I felt like Lee Everett.\n\n// Story - Morality //\n\nPeople love Mass Effect for it's Paragon/Renegade system, and so do I.  The idea of having the freedom to express your morality, your...discrimination when it comes to morally gray, or lose-lose type of choices, usually with an urgency that rushes you to choose from your gut.   You may find yourself surprised with the option you pick...and you may be disgusted with the final outcome.  Nevertheless, you must push through.  You're either alive, or you aren't.  This effect...gives this game infinite replay value, in my opinion.  Every playthrough can be intuitive, different, like an interactive movie, a virtual reality where you're along for the ride.\n\n// Story - Characters //\n\nI loved them all.  No time to go into details; but they are compelling.  Some of them you love to hate; but the voice acting, the script, the atmopshere, the...pathos, the underlying emotional motives;  it is all spot on.  I have NEVER heard better voice acting, more organic and appopriate to it's theme, than this game.   I imagine some folks might not like the ethnicity of the protagonist, and I can only chuckle heartily at the game they are missing out on.  When the much feared, much anticipated climax was upon me, my eyes watered with true empathy for these fictional people on my screen.  Tears welled up and started to slowly run.   My Lee's show ended with a bang; and a tear fell from my eye as the screen faded to black.  Perfect.\n\n// Interactive Environments //\n\nGone are the King's Quest days of cumbersome inventories and unwieldly combat; Telltale games mixes their beautiful narrative with heart-attack tense moments of survival stealth, zombie-slaying combat, and the occasional homicidal outburst.\n\n// Microsoft X-Input Controller Support //\n\nThis is a big one for me.  If you own an Xbox 360 controller, or any other modern gamepad that supports the X-Input gamepad driver, you can use said gamepad fluidly and flawlessly in this game.  A game like this benefits from a gamepad, as there are many moments of rapidly button mashing 'A' to pry zombies off of you and avoid your entrails being ripped out of you.  A keyboard would probably work OKAY; but it was developed to be played on a gamepad.   Don't believe the hipster fad of dissing gamepads being used with PCs; they have USBs on them for a reason.\n\n// Telltale Games -- Conclusion //\n\nI don't want to seem like a fanboy.  I have absolutely nothing invested emotionally in this company; I didn't know they existed before a very generous friend bought me this game as a gift; but having completed the game, I must say...these people are the real deal.\n\nIf you want to support creative, intellectual, immersive, content-rich, story-driven, complex games that cause one to reconsider his very perspective of reality...please...support this company.","December 5, 2014","true","80.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you think there's going to be a lot of action, you're wrong. The gem of this post-apocalyptic wasteland is the time you spend bonding or identifying with the characters. The story moves forward and forward, and only one thing remains constant in this game; Lee and Clementine's bond. Above all else, think about Clementine, because Lee is there with his manly soothing voice.\n\nIn all seriousness, the game is GREAT. A lot of solving puzzles, defusing situations, and learning how each person stands in a situation. There are only a few hard choices compared to the second season, but assuming you choose the right choices, this ride of a game will take you from neutrality to empathy, to sadness, and then just misery. You're going to be flat-out bawling like I did when I finished this.

You may check trailers and you will understand.\nWhat we got here is a realistic comic story coming alive through animation.\n\nhowever, i noticed some bugs. not sure if its cos of my rig's age, but i noticed some very few bugs in the game.\nlike a door animation missplacement once, or a face animation that was supposed not to be talking but the mouth was animated if it did.\nBut well.. IMHO those were completelly minimal stuff to me. bugs exist in all games anyway so.\n\n\nMusic and sounds\nMusic enough to let you concentrate on what you have to concentrate on.\nPretty much is there, but doesn't take your attention away.\nNo special soundtrack selections though no.\nSounds and sound effect are pretty neat. Everything is simple and cool.\nZombie sounds are pretty as amazing as i expected.\n\nGameplay\nThe game is focuses on a story, passing through your monitor's screen like a movie.\nThe developer's said what you do matters on what happenes next, and they give you dialogue selections.\nBUT don't get it wrong. The story WILL take you into direct events and you will just have to follow that line.\nThe only reason they give your those dialogue and action selections is to form the herp's character\nas you wish and affect the way the other characters see you and talk to you later on.\n\nYou can be a good guy, a ♥♥♥♥, a neutral person. the NPCs will remember your decisions and actions\nand it will affect their dialogies depending how much they trust or like you.\n\nMeanwhile the style of the experience is around the mood of an adventure game.\nVery basic moving controls, going through puzzling situations, examining items and landscapes and stuff.\n\n\nControls\nVery simple controls. W,A,S,D movement, itema nd action selections, left click for action.\nUsing your cursor will help you look and investigate the places and items you want, aiming to kill zombies and generaly perform actions.\n\n\nThe Story\nIf you also are a fan of The Walking Dead, then your most def need to check this game cos then you know\nhow awesome this zombie plot can be.\nIf you are not then 2 things; either watch teh series first - cos the game contains a few spoilers\nor if you don't like the show just check teh game as a piece in your zombie fan collection.\n\nA warnign though. This is no happy candy smiley story here. We are talking about drama and crazy plot spins.\nIf you like drama combined in a zombie story, then you will love this story for sure.\n\nThe Characters\nQuite a number of characters to meet in the game. The story leads you right to them anyway.\nThe voicing is simple and nice. Each 'person' in the game has its own character and background story.\nYou will have to interact, take decisions, gain their trust of ♥♥♥♥ them up. make friends or enemies.\nit was interesting for me going through the game, talking to all the characters,\nfinding out about their motivations,\ntrying to seek alies while in the middle of that survival horror you are places in.\n\nvalue/time\nThe developers were smart enough to bring you the story in pieces.\nThis way you still feel the need to see more and you never get bored.\nATM there are 3 out of the total 5 chapters of the game available, each comes as a form of a free autoDLC update\nallowing you to continue from where you left last time.\nThe game is worth the while for zombie fans and fans of the specific comic or the show.\nI'm not sure how much it will last in time, probably not for much longer.\n\nThe tv show is going to open the 3rd season soon and seems like there's a lot more ahead to see.\nSo game developers will probably just end our game story at teh 5th chapter,\nand leave the ground free for Activisions FPS The Walking Dead game, coming (as said) on summer 2013.\n\nconclusion\nso yeah. recommended depending your tastes.\nfor my tastes this game is TOTALLY RECOMMENDED.\nhope this review helped you.\ncheck screenshots and trailers if you like.\nalso check this gameplay vid in the link bellow with little to no spoilers inside,\nit will help you take a look of what this is about.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXYMcPlUKh8","September 11, 2012","true","21.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seriouscatnz/recommended/207610/","seriouscatnz","SeriousCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seriouscatnz/","365 products in account","Rating: 10/10\n\nThe Walking Dead (Season One) is an adventure game following Lee Everett, as he works with survivors he meets along the way to stay alive in the outbreak of a zombie apocalypse. The story is split into five episodes. Each episode has five points where you'll have to make a big decision with two choices, and these decisions will alter the story in subsequent decisions and episodes. As an example of the quality of storytelling, there are no complex puzzles or difficult quick time events (QTE). The entire game focuses on the story and their effect on character development.\n\nThe game series, much like the graphic novel and television series, is really about exploring how humanity copes with moral ambiguity and survival in the direst circumstances. There's a constant tension between the three elements of short term survival risk, moral principles, and long term group cohesion. The morality behind decisions and their intentions are ambiguous, even as their consequences are revealed. Much of the time you'll engage in hypotheticals, wondering whether the outcome would've been different if you made the same gamble in the future, especially when your decision was based on good intentions and unwittingly backfired. Often you'll have no good options, only those terrible and worse.\n\nYou'll meet characters that surprisingly hold their own as stalwart and capable group members, whilst others are clearly overwhelmed and become nihilistic or panic, putting the group or even themselves in danger. Powerful egos can clash when, out of genuine selflessness, a few members feel passionately that their ideas provide the best chance of survival for everyone. It's up to Lee to try to massage the group politics to ensure everyone gets along, but this won't always be possible. Not everyone is as noble or trustworthy, and few are as they first appear. You'll meet some truly despicable people, yet most 'villains' you'll encounter won't be unambiguously evil, but simply did what they thought best in a difficult situation and fell short of the task—their true failure wasn't malicious intent but incompetence.\n\nAs you'll quickly discover, the story centres on the relationship between Lee and Clementine, whilst other non-player characters (NPCs) are of peripheral significance. The only complaint is that the character Clementine is a hair's breadth away from being a clichéd Mary Sue. Her only limitation is her young age, and even then she displays remarkable courage and maturity. (For those unfamiliar with the term, a "Mary Sue" is a character who is ideal and lacks any real flaws.) However, this doesn't make Clementine any less endearing and she is widely considered the most beloved character of the series.\n\nThe ending made me tear up—and I have quite a stony heart.","September 1, 2014","true","14.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's more like watching episodes of The Walking Dead, making decisions for the character and thinking on your feet. Essentially, it's a story based game, which is really, really enjoyable, if you love The Walking Dead.\n\nYour character is Lee, a guy who got in some trouble with the police when the apocalypse hit. He meets a little girl, Clementine, and the pair embark upon a journey together, meeting different people along the way. The story itself is absolutely captivating, and rest assured, even the most indifferent of people will shed a tear by the end of this game. The story changes completely depending on which choices you make, which is really difficult for somebody as bloody indecisive as me, and I had to restart sections frequently because I'd felt my choice had been wrong. It's moral led, which makes it even more challenging, as you have to make difficult decisions about food sharing, lying to people you like and ultimately, saving people. The game is extremely engrossing and you can't help but get emotionally involved.\n\nThis was the perfect 'Sunday' game for me. A game you can ultimately enjoy playing when you're feeling a bit rough from all the alcohol you had the night before (ahem). It is involving, enjoyable and tests your survival instincts - not just finding food and shelter, but also your manipulation or capitulation when dealing with other people. I absolutely recommend it, especially if you're a fan of the TV series or comics.","August 5, 2014","true","22.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/recommended/207610/","wolfrevo","Wolf Revo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/","346 products in account","I'll try to write this review without giving too many spoilers.\n\nThe Walking Dead takes place in the same universe as the comics and TV show, but it is an entirely new cast. I think this is probably for the best, because a lot of games that try to recreate a movie exactly fail miserably.\n\nYou are placed in the role of Lee Everett, who at the beginning of the game is in the back of a police car on his way to prison. Very soon after the zombies start popping up, you meet Clementine, an eight year old whose parents were away in Savannah when the outbreak happened. Obviously her motivation is to find her parents, and Lee's motivation is to protect her at all costs.\n\nA theme that pops up on a fairly regular basis is the effect that all of this apocalypsness can have on the people who are living through it. This is conveyed several times by showing Clementine seeing something awful happen.\n\nThe gameplay is driven by quicktime events, puzzles, and choices.\nThe quicktime events only occur when you have gotten grabbed by zombies or are otherwise in immediate danger. They aren't ridiculous, mostly just mashing Q and then hitting E to finish it off.\nObviously the puzzles take place in between high-action parts of the game, and usually involve figuring out how to open this door to get this item which you need to complete this task. Oftentimes the areas with puzzles also provide a nice opportunity to chat with other members of your group and get to know them better.\nSpeaking of the characters, they are the ones that drive the story, and almost all of the choices you have to make have some direct effect on the members of your group. Some are blatant "save person A or person B," but others are more subtle ones that depend on dialogue options or how you decide to divvy up the dwindling supplies. The screenshot above is of me deciding to chop off a guy's leg to free him from a bear trap; I didn't fully realize it at the time, but I could have chosen not to do it. I was just doing what I thought was necessary. I tried everything else first, I swear.\nThe fact that the consequences of your actions are not immediately apparent is what really sells the sense of realism for me. For example, after I lost a certain character, I spent a long time (outside of the game during my real life, mind you) analyzing all of the choices that I had made leading up to their death. I was trying to think of a way to save them, but I'm still not sure if I could have done anything. The fact that I don't know if the event was scripted or happened because of my choices really shows you how well it is doing its job. I am probably not going to go back to try to change that moment, because I feel that that would cheapen the experience.\n\nThe suspense ramps up during the fourth episode, and the finale absolutely blew me away.\n\nThe 400 Days DLC serves to bridge the gap between the original game and Season 2. It introduces several new characters who will appear in Season 2; they are playable in this DLC, but I do not think that they will be playable in Season 2.\n\nThere are five characters, and you can play their stories in any order. They all take place within a couple hundred days of the zombie outbreak. They also occur relatively close together, so some common characters and locations appear in multiple chapters.\n\nThe decisions you make in each person's story determines the decision they make at the end of the episode. This in turn will affect where they are and who they trust during Season 2. Interestingly, almost none of the decisions from Season 1 have an impact in 400 Days, though they will undoubtedly have a greater impact in Season 2.\n\nObviously it only makes sense to buy 400 Days if you are planning on playing Season 2. If you are as invested in The Walking Dead as I am though, it's pretty much a no-brainer and well worth the $5.","September 10, 2012","true","26.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Amazing concept, amazing writing, and a masterpiece of a plot. A game I've spent hours playing, but even more discussing the ethics behind certain choices and the motives behind certain characters. Has a couple of issues but still worth playing for anyone who can appreciate a game that takes story, interactive film gameplay, and choices to new levels. With a finale that puts most other games to shame, Walking Dead sends you in, and out, with a bang.","June 20, 2014","true","43.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes I watched all the seasons and I think the whole story is crap, how the characters behave, they all act like idiots or teenagers with a lot of hormones on them, everything that happens is stupid and you can't believe it I cannot feel attach or care with any of the characters because they are idiots and do stupid things, they are always putting themselves on risky situations for nothing. Here in the game on the other hand it's just as real as it gets (well sometimes you will find silly things but they are very scarce throughout the game), your main protagonist acts like a real human ADULT guy and the choices you made are really hard ones and they do carry consequences in both long and short term. You will end up caring for the characters.\nYou will hate some characters and love others, but all of them behave like real people!\nThe voice acting is superb!\nThis game is a must game, BUY IT you won't regret it.\n\nThe bad: Well the game is very poor optimized, don't know if it's the engine or what but it will hang between scenes for a few seconds, it's really annoying.\nThe save system is not the best either, it will save from time to time (always on the same parts) so lets say you made a choice but you dont like it and want to load and try it again...well bad luck for you, sometimes you will have to play 30min...\nYou can't skip the dialogs. (in a game like this with a lot of choices it's a must!)\nThe DLC is very short!\nLast and I don't know if this is a bad thing (it was for me) the dialog options sometimes goes too fast, there are times when you don't have time to read what's on the screen but you need to take an action or the game will do it for you, lets say you need to read 4 lines in 3 seconds. (most of the time the games picks to not say anything at all on those cases) Happened to me 1 time on the entire game but It felt like the game was forcing me to take an answer and maybe with more time to think about it I would picked other and not that one.","May 2, 2014","true","14.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You may check trailers and you will understand.\nWhat we got here is a realistic comic story coming alive through animation.\n\nhowever, i noticed some bugs. not sure if its cos of my rig's age, but i noticed some very few bugs in the game.\nlike a door animation missplacement once, or a face animation that was supposed not to be talking but the mouth was animated if it did.\nBut well.. IMHO those were completelly minimal stuff to me. bugs exist in all games anyway so.\n\n\nMusic and sounds\nMusic enough to let you concentrate on what you have to concentrate on.\nPretty much is there, but doesn't take your attention away.\nNo special soundtrack selections though no.\nSounds and sound effect are pretty neat. Everything is simple and cool.\nZombie sounds are pretty as amazing as i expected.\n\nGameplay\nThe game is focuses on a story, passing through your monitor's screen like a movie.\nThe developer's said what you do matters on what happenes next, and they give you dialogue selections.\nBUT don't get it wrong. The story WILL take you into direct events and you will just have to follow that line.\nThe only reason they give your those dialogue and action selections is to form the herp's character\nas you wish and affect the way the other characters see you and talk to you later on.\n\nYou can be a good guy, a ♥♥♥♥, a neutral person. the NPCs will remember your decisions and actions\nand it will affect their dialogies depending how much they trust or like you.\n\nMeanwhile the style of the experience is around the mood of an adventure game.\nVery basic moving controls, going through puzzling situations, examining items and landscapes and stuff.\n\n\nControls\nVery simple controls. W,A,S,D movement, itema nd action selections, left click for action.\nUsing your cursor will help you look and investigate the places and items you want, aiming to kill zombies and generaly perform actions.\n\n\nThe Story\nIf you also are a fan of The Walking Dead, then your most def need to check this game cos then you know\nhow awesome this zombie plot can be.\nIf you are not then 2 things; either watch teh series first - cos the game contains a few spoilers\nor if you don't like the show just check teh game as a piece in your zombie fan collection.\n\nA warnign though. This is no happy candy smiley story here. We are talking about drama and crazy plot spins.\nIf you like drama combined in a zombie story, then you will love this story for sure.\n\nThe Characters\nQuite a number of characters to meet in the game. The story leads you right to them anyway.\nThe voicing is simple and nice. Each 'person' in the game has its own character and background story.\nYou will have to interact, take decisions, gain their trust of ♥♥♥♥ them up. make friends or enemies.\nit was interesting for me going through the game, talking to all the characters,\nfinding out about their motivations,\ntrying to seek alies while in the middle of that survival horror you are places in.\n\nvalue/time\nThe developers were smart enough to bring you the story in pieces.\nThis way you still feel the need to see more and you never get bored.\nATM there are 3 out of the total 5 chapters of the game available, each comes as a form of a free autoDLC update\nallowing you to continue from where you left last time.\nThe game is worth the while for zombie fans and fans of the specific comic or the show.\nI'm not sure how much it will last in time, probably not for much longer.\n\nThe tv show is going to open the 3rd season soon and seems like there's a lot more ahead to see.\nSo game developers will probably just end our game story at teh 5th chapter,\nand leave the ground free for Activisions FPS The Walking Dead game, coming (as said) on summer 2013.\n\nconclusion\nso yeah. recommended depending your tastes.\nfor my tastes this game is TOTALLY RECOMMENDED.\nhope this review helped you.\ncheck screenshots and trailers if you like.\nalso check this gameplay vid in the link bellow with little to no spoilers inside,\nit will help you take a look of what this is about.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXYMcPlUKh8","September 11, 2012","true","21.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","9"

If you think there's going to be a lot of action, you're wrong. The gem of this post-apocalyptic wasteland is the time you spend bonding or identifying with the characters. The story moves forward and forward, and only one thing remains constant in this game; Lee and Clementine's bond. Above all else, think about Clementine, because Lee is there with his manly soothing voice.\n\nIn all seriousness, the game is GREAT. A lot of solving puzzles, defusing situations, and learning how each person stands in a situation. There are only a few hard choices compared to the second season, but assuming you choose the right choices, this ride of a game will take you from neutrality to empathy, to sadness, and then just misery. You're going to be flat-out bawling like I did when I finished this. The 400 Days Expansion is also worth its money, because it too affects the second season and any person that plays this game and finishes will crave more anyhow.

Throughout the game Lee and Clem meet all sorts of characters and together try and survive in a world gone mad.\nThe Storyline is dark in places and full of twists and turns but i felt myself constantly wanting more, it was like a book i couldnt put down chapter after chapter.\nThere are lots of great things i can say about this game, the character development is some of the best i've seen in any game.  The dialogue is perfect, it really gives each character a personality and you get the feeling these people really exist.\nWith every conversation i found myself not just trying to say the right thing but voicing my own opinion as if i was the main character i was playing (Lee).  From dilemma's to arguements to simple discussions and decisions this is a game that will make you wonder a second later if you did or said the right thing.  The fact that almost everything you say or do has a lasting effect and moulds the game to your decisions amazes me.\nThe quicktime events are quite simple at times but then it really catches you off guard at other times where you near enough need lightning reflex's.\nI've never been a fan of cell shaded games but this is just something else, graphically it looks fantastic.\nBy the end of chapter five i didnt want it to end, i felt a real deep connection to each of the characters, even more so with Lee and Clementine.\nTelltale did a fantastic job with this game and really can't wait for future installments of this series.\n9.5/10","March 30, 2015","true","18.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game made me cry, it made me make unspeakable decisions, and it did what no over game has ever done; it made me care about the characters Lee was with, as though they were my own freinds. My own family. I never gave up on them, and as I played the game further and further I felt everything slipping out of control till the inevitable end. And the thing I know is that it didn't all have to end like that. I could've saved people, and while I was playing I kept asking myself would it have been different and better for the characters if I had made choice A instead of choice B at point X in the game.

I wasn't really interested into Telltale's The Walking Dead Game until just recently. I'm so glad that I did. This game feels like TV, AMC's The Walking Dead. The way how it is, how everything feels, it's pretty similar. In this game, you go with Lee Everett, who is brought into the world of the dead unexpectedly. The characters in this game, are likeable, even if there are some, a bit annoying, but that's hardly the case.\nYour choices, you choose what Lee will say at many points, and it will affect relationships and events. It's amazing to see how each character can grow, like how Lee and Clementine was. Telltale's The Walking Dead is a perfect game. I may have gotten some anxiety into what choices I may have chosen, but, that's what this game gets taken to a whole level. Your choices matter. Everything matters. Even if you're not a huge zombie fan, I still recommend this game, for being what it is. This game gives you the question of, "If you were in this position, what would you do?"\nThis games gets to you, and I recommend to everyone who hasn't tried it.

Ben is the dumbest piece of ♥♥♥♥ I've ever seen in a game. He is the epitome of what a stupid teenage boy is and can aspire to.

It's not about a series of random choices or making the "bad decision" just for the hell of it. The game makes you start to care about those choices. And who is to say, really, what the right or wrong decisions are in a time and place so desperate as the world full of the dead walking? One of the best moments came as early as Episode 2 - where Lee, the main character, is forced to divide up a few food rations among too many people. Obviously it was one of those agonizing decisions faced by the protagonist, but I found myself more moved by that one moment than by many of those big "AAA" titles, even the ones that focus on a huge, immersive story.\n\nI'd recommend this even for those who have never played an adventure game before, or think that by doing so, they aren't playing an actual video game. Certain points in the game require a quick decision or action, which makes this more than just a linear, interactive story. The Walking Dead has it all - great story, gripping plot, complex characters, nice visuals, and lots of content. In fact, I'd say this one game has more hours of content than a lot of more expensive titles out there. Unlike some adventure games, where decisions don't really affect the "big picture" outcome, this game will record early decisions and have them influence events in later episodes.

This game represents a growing "genre" in video games that some have called "interactive storytelling." There isn't really a "game" in here, in the sense that you don't control everything your character does. This game reminds me of a rail-shooter (like house of the dead) except you don't have a gun and the few shooting sections that are in the game are terrible. No, this game is more akin to a point-and-click adventure that uses a lot of quick-time events and every now and again you can move your character around, woot! However, if you are a fan of point-and-click adventure games, or have an open-mind to that kind of experience, then none of what I have said so far is really a problem.\n\nThis game's glaring flaw is as Morpheus once put it in The Matrix, the problem is choice. This game claims to give you tough choices that will completely change the outcome of the story, but that is a total lie. Almost every choice in the game has little-to-no effect upon the over-arching story. The only thing your choices affect are the relationships with other characters, but you will never find yourself in a different town/base with completely different companions, or that any of your choices have more than one outcome, as all of the big decisions are locked in. Many choices aren't even choices! For instance, (SEMISPOILER ALERT) early on you have to choose to save the life of two people in trouble, but it's not really a choice because one of them is a child! What monster would chooses the other person? By the way, it doesn't matter anyway, because no matter what you choose the child lives and the other person dies. See what I mean? Every decision is like this, so it really matters little what you choose. So if you get this game, get it on sale and play it for the enjoyment of the story, don't expect to make any waves with your decision-making skills.","December 21, 2013","true","8.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was wrong.\nThis game really shows, how cruel can be people when they are in danger. Greedy and awful.\nThis game shows the other side of human visage. It tells beautiful story of survivior- Lee and his ward- Clementine.\nI just could not stop playing when I bought it. Unfortunately I haven not got internet connection, so Steam statistics show just 5.8 hours. But for real, I ended it two times and both times it was very sad but beauty story.\nI think everyone should try playing that title, even if you do not like 'point and clicks'.\nThis is not normal 'PnC', this is like interactive movie, where you decide, what will happen next.\nThat is why I hardly recomend this game. Telltale- good job ;)!\n\nPros:\n-Plot (whole history is awesome)\n-Moral choices (you can decide about almsot everything)\n-Optymalization (game works really good, even on older PC's)\n\nCons:\n-Lots of choices do not change game much (also lots of them do not change anything)\n-Gnere (this is individual but some people hates 'Point and Clicks'\n\nMy rating:\n7.5 out of 10","April 28","true","5.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

Based off Robert Kirkman's critically acclaimed 'The Walking Dead' comic book series, this game is a point-and-click narrative adventure; you control a character named Lee, who has to fight to protect a young girl named Clementine in the wake of a zombie apocalypse.\nTold over five episodes, TWD is played out like a typical point and click adventure; click on items, click on dialogue bubbles and click on areas to make Lee move. You'll rarely be in direct control of the action, but this is a strength rather than a weakness. You're a viewer of a cinematic masterpice, along for the ride, who chooses Lee's every word and makes every decision for him. The decisions you make will affect your relationships with other characters and ultimately affect the way Clementine views you and acts the way she does. The voicework and visuals is phenomenal, and allows you to experience the game just the same as a film or a television series. The story is brilliantly told, and you'll find yourself genuinely caring about the characters as events unfold, which is a damn marvel in today's gaming industry.\nThe Walking Dead is a unique and entertaining game, with emphasis on narrative and character development unlike any other game I've ever played. You'll remember the ending long after you finish the game, which only serves to demonstrate the quality writing exhibited by Telltale. 10 / 10\n","July 31, 2014","true","23.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pyrosushi/recommended/207610/","pyrosushi","**Pyro$u$hi**(∩_∩)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pyrosushi/","326 products in account","Here is an immersive game that will  get you so absorbed into the storyline.\n\n(To anyone who hasnt played yet, this is a BIT of a spoiler. It is in the demos and trailers anyways so not really a spoiler)\nIt starts out with the main survivor Lee Everett heading to prison for murdering his wife. Along the way, the careless sheriff driving him does not see a walker on the road and well, sh** happens. (You can start reading now :) )\n\nFrom here on, I practically never got bored. I listened carefully and read the lines spoken from the characters. There were lots of emotions flying about and none were left out. Love, contempt, sorrow, and joy is mixed in the story along with shocking results from each part of the episodes. I love the game and I haven't gone through all of it just yet. The next season is coming out in about a week from now. To anyone reading this review and trying to decide whether to like this review or not with their twitchy finger, I'd rather you buy the game. Play it as much as you can BEFORE the next one comes out. Then preorder that one. Or buy it then play it. The game will not let you down and the next season won't either. Keep in mind that Telltale games release EPISODES for the game. You buy the game and you get to recieve the episodes (for free of course) but most of the time the episodes are released once a month.\n\nIt is also the same concept with "The Wolf Amongst Us". Which is also highly recommended and I will do a review on once over 50% of progress is accomplished.\n\nThis game is worth the money. Especially when the story probably goes for more than 9 hours even if you tried to skip through the entire game. It is immersive, intense, and packed with emotions that keeps the gamer's eyes on the game. Unless the game of course cries about graphics and goes to play Crysis or some random FPS game like COD.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this review. Have a good game session!","December 7, 2013","true","15.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Some people say that you're decisions do not actually impact the story which is kinda true and kinda false. The decisions that do impact the game tend to be a 2-choice decision usually deciding which people survive and those that don't. Other conversations that have 3-4 options tend only to result in slightly varied dialouge which all end up at the same conclusion. Also, your answers to those "impacting" questions will be re shown at the end of each episode showing what percentage of other players made the same decision as you. Kind of a nify addition.\n\nControls: I actually streamed the game to my laptop from my desktop, and played it in bed with a controller. This game is perfect with controllers considering that most of the time you're not pressing more than one button at a time. On occasion you'll have to aim and shoot quickly, but it's not nearly as fast paced as an FPS.\n\nStory: Ohh.... THE FEELS.... This story, just like the Walking Dead TV show (Which I am a huge fan of) the game focuses less on the "Senseless zombie killing rambo god ♥♥♥♥" and more on the drama, trauma, stress, and conflict that can come to those survivng the zombie apocalypse.\n\nHere is a breif Synopsis: (Mild spoilers):\n\nYour name is Lee. You have been arrested for murder, and are on your way to jail when the cop driver hits something on the road and swerves into a ditch. You wake up to the Zombie Apocalypse. You eventually manage to flee your way into a nearby neighborhood where you meet Clementine - the most sweetest, kickass, little girl you will ever meet. Clem and Lee then decide to make their way to Savannah, where Clem's parents were supposedly staying. Along the way you make many friends, have some heart breaking losses, and are faced with situations that I hope I never have to face in real life.\n\nThroughout the game, you will learn so much about your fellow survivors that you will consider them family. And I swear that unless you are some heartless, emotionless, souless monster, this game will hit you right in the feels as well.\n\nGraphics: The story is enough, If you only consider games if they have Triple-A graphics, then shoo, we don't like you're kind.\n\n\nI hope this honest review helped sway some of you into buying this awesome game!","September 17, 2014","true","12.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The Walking Dead combines an emotional unique storyline with some unimportant click 'n'point adventure elements. It may not be a game, more a movie where you face life-and-death decisions. Sometimes a bit too slow, a bit walking too dead, it's a mere stunning, unique computer game experience that I have to recommend highly to everyone able in supporting some very disgusting, scarry moments.

I knew it had good reviews and that's why I tried it.\nIt turned out to be by far the BEST COMMERCIAL PRODUCT I've ever bought in my LIFE, better than any movie, game, book or anything else I've ever bought so far.\nThe game genre is said to be a "Point'n'Click", but in fact it isn't that much ; there is no puzzle, there is just the story, and you implicated in it.\nI couldn't say this is a "game" though, you won't play, but you will be told a story, a beautiful story in witch you will be emotionnaly implicated as long as it speaks you to.\nBasically, I could say that the game is a big cutscene that you influate by your actions (by what you say in fact, choosing how to answer to the main characters). I KNOW that it sounds strange or bad, but it isn't, there is no way to properly describe how good this "game" is.\nTo be a bit more clear, I would only see 3 reasons why someone could not like a game like that :\n● They don't like cell-shading graphics (look at the screenshots)\n● They absolutely hate stories that take place in a Zombie Apocalypse environnement\n● They don't have a good English Level or don't know how to Install translations (2nd Season is in Full-English)\n\nPros :\n\n+ Incredibely good voice-acting and credible characters\n+ The way you are emotionally implied in the story, never had I seen that before in ANY game\n+ The possibility to "influence" the story and that you always feel that what's happening is because of your choices\n+ The whole story is intense, everything is useful, there would be no part to scrap down, I wasn't bored a SINGLE SECOND.\n+ Clementine as a deuteragonist (Season 1) and protagonist (Season 2), Tomboys as a main character FTW. :heart:\n+ The story is in NOW WAY predictable, you never know what will happen next.\n+ Incredibly good "filming" and animation and character facial expression, as good and even better than most TV Series.\n+ The end... really... only time I cried in a Video Game.\n+ Good Music (special mention for the End Credits)\n+ Simple controls : WASD + Mouse\n+ There is no need of a Gaming PC to run this, most computers will do the job\n+ You don't play this game, this is the game that plays you\n\nCons :\n\n- It has an end... no really... NO CON\n(-) Can have some resolution problems that can be fixed by the simple addition of a line in the start options on Steam\n(-) Translations in other languages than English are fan-made, the one for Season 2 isn't included with the Game ; play in English if you could for maximal effect.\n\nConclusion : A MUST-TRY (at least in Sales, and at least for Season 1), 11/10 : best "game" and product I've ever purchased in my life ; I know that every game I'll play for a decade will surely not be as good as this one ; this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, THANKS Telltale Games =) + please, Clementine again in Season 3 :beg:\n\nPS. There is absolutely no need to know the Comic Series or the TV Series "The Walking Dead" to enjoy this game, the story is an original one based on the Comics.\nPSS. You will certainly need a little time to fully enter in the story, try to play at least 2 hours before saying that you definitely don't like it or you could miss something.\nPSSS. You need to play this "game" ALONE for a maximum effect.","January 23, 2015","true","12.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

While somewhat lacking in the puzzle solving elements which are a staple in most point and click adventures, Telltale focus on creating an incredibly immersive story with characters you actually care about. Some of the choices you have to make in this game will really hit you hard and has genuine repercussions instead of just black or white, along with some truly shocking moments throughout the five episodes. I haven't enjoyed a game storyline this much since Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I've not really been a fan of Telltale's games in the past but what they've achieved with The Walking Dead is nothing short of amazing.\n\nThis is my first delve into The Walking Dead universe and I was just hooked from the start right until the end.

No option to turn this off.  2)  Turn on Detect Selectables and Turn off Story Notifications.   Pixel hunting is not what this is about.  3) There are a few sequences where the lack of inverted controls can cause issues for people that are not comfortable with non-inverted controls in the first person.  4) If you're not a fan of this genre play it anyway, it's that good.","July 7, 2013","true","20.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The Walking Dead by TellTale Games, is a must-have game that needs to be in your steam library. I mean honestly, you and everyone else who doesn't have this game, should be throwing money at it.\n\nAtmosphereThe atmosphere in the game is simply astounding. If you decide to go heavy into this game (which you should, to get the most out of it), in tense moments of the game, you really feel it along with the characters. I found myself shedding a tear or so when something bad happens/happened. And at the end, oh boy did I turn into a fountain. Honestly, if you didn't shed a single tear at the end, congratulations! You're a psychopath.\n\nChoicesChoices in this game are very impactful. Sometimes not so much, but a majority of them are. I won't spoil anything, but just be ready to make not only tough decisions, but fast ones as for most of the choices you have a certain time limit, which varies in length.\n\nMusicWhat kind of music is to be played when and where is simply gorgeous. To me, music can make or break a moment, deciding the factor whether you couldn't care less, feel horrible for the character, or be happy like the sun.\n\nRelationshipsTo kind of go along with the choices section, there are so many different relationships you can have with people. You can befriend Larry, or be an enemy with him, and so goes for Kenny and everyone else.\n\nNegativesThe only thing I can really put down about this game is some of it's realism and glitches. (yes, I know that it's a zombie apocalypse and it's not real, just a game der da duh), For example, at the start when Lee slips on some blood, the blow his head takes (giggity) should have killed him or immobilized him for a while. There are also some continuity errors such as "I only got one bullet left!" then shoots three bullets.\n\nPlotThe plot of "The Walking Dead" is great. It's involving and it's alot easier to remember since you're the one making the plot. This is just a quick, and basic run-down. (no spoilers ahead) You start off as Lee. He's on his way to prison when they are involved with a car crash. a little girl saves him and from then on they fight for survival.\n\nConclusionOverall, I would highly reccommend this game to anyone a fan of story-based games, a point-and-click adventure or a fan of "The Walking Dead" television show or comic books. 9/10.","January 2","true","13.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

It brings you into a dark deep atmosphere of postapocalyptic world, you'll follow characters stories and will make choices of their desteny. TWD game is the best game of such genre and it's how I see the perfect game that is related to the main comic series.","September 7, 2013","true","12.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

The Walking Dead unatoč tome što po pitanju gameplaya nudi vrlo malo toga (najosnovnija interakcija s okolinom, povremene FPS dionice, jednostavne logičke zagonetke), kroz vrhunsku izgradnju likova i vrlo dobro odrađen epizodni format razvoja priče, debelo to kompenzira. Iako isfuran predložak, hodajući leševi iskorišteni su na najbolji mogući način - pomoću njih stvoren je apokaliptični svijet u kojem su sve društvene norme pale u vodu i u kojem se igrača konstantno tjera na donošenje teških odluka s čijim posljedicama se kasnije mora suočiti. Igra je krcata moralnim dilemama za koje se na kraju svake epizode kroz statistike može vidjeti kako su drugi razmišljali. Naglasio bi kako se The Walking Dead teško može svrstati u domenu nekakve "normalne igre", odnosno avanture - fokus je na priču, likove i donošenje odluka. Oni koji traže izazov ovdje ili jednostavno ne vole većinu vremena provesti gledajući video sekvence, neka pristupe ovome s određenom dozom skepse. Za sve ostale vrlo topla preporuka.","June 18, 2014","true","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","5"

The main mechanic is dialogue. You choose your response and statements to people which can have different outcomes which makes you think about what you say.

Gameplay mostly consists of mild (often guided) exploration, rudimentary inventory management and in-context quick-time events, which serves its function of moving the story along between locations and disasters.\n\nIf you are a fan of any facet of The Walking Dead (TV or graphic novel) then this is indispensable.","December 22, 2014","true","15.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You and Clem are the main characters and fight zombies (aka walkers/geeks) and the odd human to survive.\n\nThere are 5 episode and an added 6th, which is DLC. Each episode is quite long, so there is a fair amount of playing time, especially if you explore everything, which you will as this game is amazing.\nThe game is tailored around YOUR decisions and can have multiple plots and can result in a different person from your group being killed due to your decisions.\n\nIt can be classed as a point and click game, but you can move around using WASD and shoot walkers when needed.\n\nGood points:\n-Runs well due to comic like graphics, especially on mid-range PCs like my own.\n-You develop feelings for Lee and Clem due to the nature of the game, you end up making every decisions based on keeping Clem happy & safe. Of course there's the option of being a jerk to her....\n-The story is immersive and the soundtrack can give goosebumps.\n-Cheap considering blockbusting titles can be €60. This is a steal.\n\nBad points:\n-Slow readers might struggle at making decisions as there are many quick time events, ran by a timer with 3/4 decisions.\n-Killing my social life :)\n\n10/10, cannot praise enough!\n","July 29, 2014","true","14.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When I first went into it I thought it was about  talking to my group and trying to change their fates through our interactions. I was horribly disappointing to realize no matter what you do or what you say, the outcome is always the same.\n\nThere is a huge amount of "illusion of choice" There is one point in the game where you have to choose between saving this guy or saving this girl. When you save one, the other dies and the story goes in a different direction and encourages replaying the game! Right? Wrong. Not twenty minutes later, the person you save dies anyways. In the end no matter your choice, both end up dead. There was no choice! This pattern continued through the whole game, I'd be promoted with a choice and the inevitable would eventually happen. I finished the game with a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nThat is until I saw a discussion online about Kenny, one of the characters. The thread started off with someone saying how awesome Kenny was.He always had your back, was friendly, sacrificed himself, he was cool. I agreed. However most people in the thread said he was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! I was completely in disagreement! They were even listing quotes he NEVER said in the game! That was when it hit me. The events of the game are unchangeable but the characters and the way they interact with you is completely different for each player depending on your choices. Kenny was a nice guy in my game but a jerk in many other people's games. It made discussion about the game a ton of fun since everyone's experience with each character was completely different. Some characters tell some players things other players will never hear them say.\n\nSure the events were out of your control but that kind of game would be a little high budget for Telltale, so I think what they pulled off was pretty well done all things considered. My advice is do NOT go into the game with the thought that you can change the outcome of certain character's gruesome fates, but you can change their personalities, and compare the differences and similarities between your characters and your friend's characters' personalities. Your "best bro" in your game could be your friend's biggest rival or worst enemy!","March 5, 2015","true","12.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Honestly I find most of them outright stupid, and with the zombie hype that has been going on the last few years the genre as a whole mostly leaves a foul taste in my mouth. But somehow I got talked into watching this show called "The Walking Dead" and it totally blew me over. Well written, great character building and feelings flying all over the board. I found it amazing that something related to zombies could be THAT good.\n\nThen I learned about that this series, or rather the universe of that series, was going to be carried over to an episodic adventure type game by no other than Telltale Games. A company that has helped keeping the adventure genre of gaming alive when it felt almost extinct. As a BIG adventure game fan I have happily supported this company by getting mostly everything they have put out, and that was also mainly the reason I got this series as well.\n\nI honestly had very little expectation of how this game series would be as I failed to see how it even would work to transfer the great writing and suspense that I experienced in the TV-series to an adventure type game. Even though I read good reviews of it I kept putting off playing it. I was absolutely certain that it was going to leave me disappointed.\n\nWell, finally I got around to play it, and now I kick myself fo not playing it sooner. I can not believe how good this game is. I don't think I can remember better storywriting in any game I've played before. You really get to know the characters you meet and you get feelings and opinions about them. You're forced to make tough decisions in critical moments and you can never be sure if you did the right thing. Well, there is not really any clear right or wrong. There is mostly various shades of grey. Not only that, but your decisions affect the ones around you, and they will remember what you did or didn't do, and the game itself shapes itself around all this and creates different routes and takes on what you experience while playing through it.\n\nAll characters are masterfully voiced by a selection of excellent voice actors that helps making the experience close to magical. You'll find yourself laughing, crying, yelling at the screen and acting in panic. And you'll probably feel that you're in the middle of it all.\n\nNow, it has to be said that this game is probably not for everybody. I can see, and even understand that people might find the gameplay itself to be a bit dull or repetetive and probably feel there is little gameplay at all. If you hate QTE's then you might want to shy away if you do not appreciate a good story. Also, even though I quite like the artstyle I see some people being thrown off a bit by the comic like cel shading, and I believe the game would be even better with a bit more realistic touch. It certainly looks good enough in its own way and should in any way be avoided with that as a reason.\n\nI consider this game to be one of those games you absolutely should not allow yourself to miss out on. It is a game for the history books and you would want to tell your grandchildren that you were there to play it.\n\nI rate this game 10/10\n\nRecommended for everybody who appreciate video games, and their mothers too.\n\nHappy Gaming\n\nTJ","March 20, 2015","true","24.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Essentially The Walking Dead is an episodic point-and-click adventure game with action sequences. More importantly, it's a captivating and touching story of a man and a little girl trying to survive a zombie apocalypse.\n\nThe puzzles are straightforward, the action sequences are very easy, there's no real challenge to be had in this game - and that's a good thing. The Walking Dead is ALL about the experience, and that experience is sensational. You make decisions for your character that influence not only the events in that episode, but also the overarching story. There are some grueling decisions to be made and you don't have all day to decide, which adds a lot of tension to the scenes.\n\nIf you've seen the TV show or read the comics then this will be an even better experience. The game takes place prior to the TV show but in the same area, with locations and characters from the TV show making cameos, albeit with different voice actors.\n\nThe 400 Days DLC is a sixth episode that is mostly unconnected to the original season. You play as five different characters in short stories that come together in a final arc. It's worth your while, but not as long as the other episodes and the actual ramifications of your choices in the DLC won't be felt until season 2.\n\nTL;DR:\nBuy it now!","August 29, 2013","true","14.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/recommended/207610/","maderschramm","Shotime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/","1157 products in account","Telltale's The Walking Dead is based on the canon of the hit TV Show and graphic novel series.  It is a point-and-click adventure game with quicktime elements - and it's a very good one.  The narrative, storytelling, and characterization is top notch and if one can refer to a story as "heavy" this game is more like having a pickup truck sitting on your chest.  It's a prime example of interactive storytelling and is an excellent model of how you can use the gaming medium to convey a story to an audience - even the camera angles it utilizes were wonderful, from staring at your reflection in a puddle as you beat someone's brain in to adding tension by having a skewed angle while you climb a ladder.  The game did have some pitfalls that comes with the point-and-click genre that it didn't avoicd unfortunately - repeatedly viewing things instead of acting on them/with them, repeating dialogue options accidentally without the ability to skip them, a few character and graphics glitches (I vividly remember speaking to an invisible Vernon and Kat cradling an invisible Duck in her arms) but besides a 4th wall breaking comic intervention these small negatives don't detract too much from the story as a whole.  The plot is very adult in nature and the gore and heavy themes are what you'd expect from a "Walking Dead" branded product.  What I found most interesting was the "illusion of choice" that seemed to be woven throughout the game.  Many people complain that every dialogue option and every choice you make should have an effect on the outcome of the game and many do; however, there are more than several situations in the game where no matter what you do something is going to go down in a certain way - many times in a way that could shock you.  As such, I recommend playing this game by the seat of your pants, don't reload, don't try again.  It's a more rewarding experience in the end since probably that one thing you didn't want to happen is going to happen regardless of what actions you take.  This can be seen as a pro or a con depending on your personality.  I find it a plus, as it allows Telltale's writers to weave a tighter narrative that has a much larger effect on the viewer than if everything turned into sunshine and rainbows for you (which is not going to happen anyway).  Leave it for a second playthrough if you must, but imagine this game as more interacting with a movie that you can steer around as you please to explore the world and interact with the characters in.\n\nSPOILER FOLLOWS - Finally the ending wasn't too fulfilling to me, it almost seems like Telltale was holding back for a future release.  I would have liked to see how your 'parenting' options throughout the episodes effected Clem, and allowed you to see what kind of person she becomes after the credits roll.  Even if her actions post ending were in a montage format that would have been fine, allowing you to see if Clem can survive in this world with the lessons you've taught her. /SPOILERS\n\nPros:\n\nGreat storytelling (narrative, themes, camerawork, "whole-package", etc.)\nHeavy, adult themes\n\nCons:\n\nMinor point-and-click pitfalls\nEnding didn't "wrap up" to my satisfaction\nSome characters (while good) felt a little static or seemed to be only "plot-devices"\n\nEven though I wasn't too impressed with the ending and the cons *appear* to outlist the pros this game is definitely worth a playthrough.  The story is great and this game is a great entrance for any gamer into interactive storytelling and what poing-and-click adventure games can be.

When I first saw that it was  developed by Telltale games I though it would be a  just a bog standard point & click adventure game, which it turned out not to be;  it's sort of half way between a p&p and a  third person action game (with some first person viewpoints).    I was immediately  struck by the art style which reminded me a lot of Borderlands and Street Fighter 4 in its   pseudo cartoon - watercolour washed   graphics.  The voice acting is brilliant accentuating  the  emotions that run throughout the game which are very powerful.   The way you choose to play the game, i.e. your  actions and choices affect how the story plays out across the entire series, making this  a game that has loads of replayability potential.\n\nI never thought I'd be saying this about   an adventure game, but I've enjoyed playing this more than other zombie games e.g. Left 4 Dead, Dead Island and the Resident Evil  franchise.","October 10, 2012","true","7.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is one of my personal favorite games. While having zombies in it, the fun doesnt come from cracking their heads (although there is plenty of it). The game is based around the relationships and interactions you have with the NPCs through the decisions you make during tough situations. You will both make and burn bridges with characters. You only hope you didnt side with the guy that gets killed ten minutes later and are stuck dealing with the guy you sided against for rest the game. As you will find if you play the game, the living can be much more dangerous than the dead. 12-15 Hours (more if you buy "400 days" episode) playthrough depending on how much stuff you examine. Its a great game, with an amazing story (that your choices help write), that is very different from other "Zombie" titles out there!","November 28, 2013","true","17.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are a few action sequences but for the most part you are interacting with the different characters you meet and making decisions about what you should do at different decision points. These decisions have repercussions on what happens in the story.\n\nAs a game it isn't very entertaining to be honest. As a story it is both bleak and potentially inspiring depending on how you look at it. Had I paid full list price I would have been greatly disappointed in both the game play and the length of the game. However, on steep sale this isn't a bad way to spend 8-10 hours or so. Just don't go into it expecting a happy ending or really even closure to the story as this is "Season 1" of a longer story arc.","December 2, 2013","true","14.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Especially amongst the zombie horror genre. TellTale have done a wonderful job in crafting a provocative story that yanks at the strings of your heart whenever it can. Forcing you to make tough decisions within a very short time, that often have dire and unforseen consequences. It's a beautifully woven tapestry of choices which can create varying and unique stories between each individual's playthrough. To top it all off, it has one of the most satisfying and emotional endings I've seen to date. It's hard to understate just how much the relationship that Lee and Clem develops can affect you as the player. For me it drove me into the role of a father figure trying to protect his daughter. And I imagine it can and will do the same for many others.\n\nWith all the praise I can give to the writing and story, I do have to point out a critical flaw with the game. In that, it's not much of a game at all. Point and click adventures have always been rather awkward for me, since they always just feel more like an interactive movie to me. And this can at times deter from your enjoyment of the story. A number of times I found myself hovering over my mouse or keyboard, just waiting for that inevitable quick time event. And as a result I felt myself growing somewhat detached from whats going on, which broke the immersion for me somewhat. But then again, this would not work as just a rolling movie either. As it is the decisions and choices that you make that help add a level of involvement to the story. Making it much more personal, as what happens is because -you- chose for it to happen. So you have to deal with the benefits and consequences of your decisions. There is no "Good" or "Best" ending in this game. Only "Your" ending. There's no scoreboard for how many survivors you met/killed, how many Walkers you decapitated. It's a mature story that's meant to be enjoyed as just that, a story. If this is what interests you, then I can't in good conscience let you go without recommending The Walking Dead whole heartidly. If you're looking for another zombie game though, I'd suggest you move on. This is one for a mature audience.\n\n10/10 from me.","February 12, 2014","true","10.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Honestly I find most of them outright stupid, and with the zombie hype that has been going on the last few years the genre as a whole mostly leaves a foul taste in my mouth. But somehow I got talked into watching this show called "The Walking Dead" and it totally blew me over. Well written, great character building and feelings flying all over the board. I found it amazing that something related to zombies could be THAT good.\n\nThen I learned about that this series, or rather the universe of that series, was going to be carried over to an episodic adventure type game by no other than Telltale Games. A company that has helped keeping the adventure genre of gaming alive when it felt almost extinct. As a BIG adventure game fan I have happily supported this company by getting mostly everything they have put out, and that was also mainly the reason I got this series as well.\n\nI honestly had very little expectation of how this game series would be as I failed to see how it even would work to transfer the great writing and suspense that I experienced in the TV-series to an adventure type game. Even though I read good reviews of it I kept putting off playing it. I was absolutely certain that it was going to leave me disappointed.\n\nWell, finally I got around to play it, and now I kick myself fo not playing it sooner. I can not believe how good this game is. I don't think I can remember better storywriting in any game I've played before. You really get to know the characters you meet and you get feelings and opinions about them. You're forced to make tough decisions in critical moments and you can never be sure if you did the right thing. Well, there is not really any clear right or wrong. There is mostly various shades of grey. Not only that, but your decisions affect the ones around you, and they will remember what you did or didn't do, and the game itself shapes itself around all this and creates different routes and takes on what you experience while playing through it.\n\nAll characters are masterfully voiced by a selection of excellent voice actors that helps making the experience close to magical. You'll find yourself laughing, crying, yelling at the screen and acting in panic. And you'll probably feel that you're in the middle of it all.\n\nNow, it has to be said that this game is probably not for everybody. I can see, and even understand that people might find the gameplay itself to be a bit dull or repetetive and probably feel there is little gameplay at all. If you hate QTE's then you might want to shy away if you do not appreciate a good story. Also, even though I quite like the artstyle I see some people being thrown off a bit by the comic like cel shading, and I believe the game would be even better with a bit more realistic touch. It certainly looks good enough in its own way and should in any way be avoided with that as a reason.\n\nI consider this game to be one of those games you absolutely should not allow yourself to miss out on. It is a game for the history books and you would want to tell your grandchildren that you were there to play it.\n\nI rate this game 10/10\n\nRecommended for everybody who appreciate video games, and their mothers too.\n\nHappy Gaming\n\nTJ","March 20, 2015","true","24.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Essentially The Walking Dead is an episodic point-and-click adventure game with action sequences. More importantly, it's a captivating and touching story of a man and a little girl trying to survive a zombie apocalypse.\n\nThe puzzles are straightforward, the action sequences are very easy, there's no real challenge to be had in this game - and that's a good thing. The Walking Dead is ALL about the experience, and that experience is sensational. You make decisions for your character that influence not only the events in that episode, but also the overarching story. There are some grueling decisions to be made and you don't have all day to decide, which adds a lot of tension to the scenes.\n\nIf you've seen the TV show or read the comics then this will be an even better experience. The game takes place prior to the TV show but in the same area, with locations and characters from the TV show making cameos, albeit with different voice actors.\n\nThe 400 Days DLC is a sixth episode that is mostly unconnected to the original season. You play as five different characters in short stories that come together in a final arc. It's worth your while, but not as long as the other episodes and the actual ramifications of your choices in the DLC won't be felt until season 2.\n\nTL;DR:\nBuy it now!","August 29, 2013","true","14.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/recommended/207610/","csabber3","Green Lantern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/","174 products in account","The Walking Dead is the prototype game in the industry that shows that storytelling and characterization in video games can easily match those we see in movies or television series. Your choices matter here more than anywhere else and can lead to devastation or salvation when you expect it the least. The well written story and your attachment to the characters - main or supporting - will keep you moving forward and make you question every decision you've made before. It's a game of 'what ifs...'.\n\nThe story begins right on the first day when the epidemic starts. The main character is Lee Everett, who is on his way to jail in a police patrol vehicle when they hit a zombified humanoid they'll refer to as 'Walkers'. After a bit of wandering in a forest we meet Clementine, the eight year old girl whose nanny has also been turned and her parents are cut off in the faraway Savannah. The two start bonding right after they meet and Lee tries to look after her the best he knows. It's a really an emotionally powerful relationship from the gecko that only gets deeper. The game never tries to be unrealistic about the characters and their motives. Their goal is to survive no matter what, and I mean no matter. Not to find out what has happened or get some kind of cure. No. This makes it so interesting, you aren't Superman nor an action hero with unlimited bullets. The characters are real, everyday people that care about their families and themselves.\n\nThe game has an episodic character. It has 5 episodes each lasting around 2-3 hours that adds up to a total of 12-14 hours of gameplay. Your choices move the story forward and the game sometimes hits you with an impossible choice that will make you wonder minutes after it. Sometimes it's really hard to make a choice, but sometimes it might not even matter in the end. You just never know when somebody steps in and changes everything. It's a great balance of making up your mind and not knowing what would've happened if. What is spectacular about the game that the other characters have their own stories and plans too, and it might not tally with your's. The rest if the cast isn't there to make your life comfortable. They aren't soulless vessels that obey everything you say. They can act on their own, even if you don't like it and often confront your choices.\n\nAs a Telltale game it has a comic book character that is unquestionable unique, but hardly state of art. Neither artistically nor technically is a phenomenal game, but it has its own tone. It has other problems too. Frame-rate drops are annoying and camera angle changes can result in a momentary freeze of screen. On the audio front the situation is much better. The music and the voice acting is top notch, that supports the deep and emotional story.\n\nTelltale has hit the mark with The Walking Dead: Season 1. It's a spectacular point-and-click game where puzzles are secondary to the story. Yes, there will be times when you have to ask questions like, 'how to make this happen?' or 'how to make that work?', but those are only evanescent. The real question that you'll ask all the time is 'what is the right decision?' But you'll find out that there isn't one. It's a cruel world where everybody tries to survive and some tries to retain their humanity. If you're trying to find a superb interactive story, look no further, because The Walking Dead is a must have experience.\n\nRating: 84/100; Replay Value: 5/5; To Beat: 12-14 hours.","January 12, 2014","true","14.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Will you become a respectable man, or will you be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ throughout the entire game? The choice is yours.\n\nWhat does matter here is the travel, and not the destination.\n\nThe graphics are enjoyable; you really feel like you're part of the original comics universe. The game developpers also had the good idea to create their own story and not simply take the comics story. This is not a simple adaptation of the comics books, this is a parallel story which does not make some fan services; the references to the books are smart and really not invasive.\n\nAll in all, this is a simple, yet very enjoyable story-driven point-and-click, merging some humor and a lot of drama in a good and smart enough interactive story.\n\nTurn the lights off, and play it alone or with someone else, and discuss about the choices you should make or should have made.\n\nA must play!\n","January 24, 2015","true","13.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Just as he thinks his life is over, he embarks on an adventure of betrayal, mistakes, and death.\nThis was probably one of the best games I have ever played. Telltale have built the characters remarkably, almost as if they were real people, they give them a human-like trait of how different people react to things.\nThe game is set out like a TV show, you get episode 1, episode 2 ect. and at the end of the epsode it gives you a perfect cliff-hanger of the next episode\nThe soundtrack was top notch, I can't write this review without commenting on the soundtrack, it was almost exactly like the sound in your head in situations in real life, I know it sounds confusing but if you listen to the soundtrack you will fully understand me.\nThe graphics were great also, it had a nice comic-y feel to it, even though I've never read The Walking Dead comic book. Although to me it was like a comic book, don't get me wrong, it was like a comic book came to life. It had great detail and shading were it needed it.\nNow, if you are looking for gameplay, don't expect anything more than clicking, wasd and the occasional q when you are not in a conversation, when you are, you use 1234 or scroll to select your option. The majority of this game, is basically an interactive cutscene, although it's not the tiresome type of cutscenes you get in some games that you wish you could skip (hopefully some of you reading this know what I'm talking about), your choices make your experience different to the other, whether it is in the next couple of conversations or in episodes ahead.\nI would reccomend this game because of the storyline and how the game 'puts you' in the story, and how successful the game is on changing the affect on how you feel. It is definitely worth the price.","May 6, 2014","true","18.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you want a game with a lot of action this is might not be for you, as it is based heavily on dialogue.  While you'll still trigger the same events in the game no matter what your choices, it is still nice to play a game that makes you feel responsible for your actions. This is easily a must-have, even if youre not a fan of any other Walking Dead media. I only have 2 main complaints though people yet to buy this game should look out for.\n\n1. Technical issues. They happen, although most won't notice them unless they know it's coming.\n2. Full season. Basically, you can't buy 1 episode and see if you like it, then buy the rest. Instead you have to buy the full season. If it's on sale for $6 something this won't matter, buy it. If you're considering getting it for full price (Which it's worth) you should have a full idea of what you're getting into.\n\nBut I digress. These are really only small complaints in what is easily one of the best games of 2012 and an essential to anyone who is looking for a good story where they truly affect the people around them. 9.5/10\n","January 24, 2014","true","13.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Especially amongst the zombie horror genre. TellTale have done a wonderful job in crafting a provocative story that yanks at the strings of your heart whenever it can. Forcing you to make tough decisions within a very short time, that often have dire and unforseen consequences. It's a beautifully woven tapestry of choices which can create varying and unique stories between each individual's playthrough. To top it all off, it has one of the most satisfying and emotional endings I've seen to date. It's hard to understate just how much the relationship that Lee and Clem develops can affect you as the player. For me it drove me into the role of a father figure trying to protect his daughter. And I imagine it can and will do the same for many others.\n\nWith all the praise I can give to the writing and story, I do have to point out a critical flaw with the game. In that, it's not much of a game at all. Point and click adventures have always been rather awkward for me, since they always just feel more like an interactive movie to me. And this can at times deter from your enjoyment of the story. A number of times I found myself hovering over my mouse or keyboard, just waiting for that inevitable quick time event. And as a result I felt myself growing somewhat detached from whats going on, which broke the immersion for me somewhat. But then again, this would not work as just a rolling movie either. As it is the decisions and choices that you make that help add a level of involvement to the story. Making it much more personal, as what happens is because -you- chose for it to happen. So you have to deal with the benefits and consequences of your decisions. There is no "Good" or "Best" ending in this game. Only "Your" ending. There's no scoreboard for how many survivors you met/killed, how many Walkers you decapitated. It's a mature story that's meant to be enjoyed as just that, a story. If this is what interests you, then I can't in good conscience let you go without recommending The Walking Dead whole heartidly. If you're looking for another zombie game though, I'd suggest you move on. This is one for a mature audience.\n\n10/10 from me.","February 12, 2014","true","10.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The full, unedited version of this review may be viewed HERE[www.trueachievements.com].\n\n\nWalk a Mile in Their Shoes\n\nTelltale Games is no stranger to adventure games, and The Walking Dead is no stranger to success lately. A rapidly growing zombie mythos, The Walking Dead has hit the media trifecta with this game: literature, film, and gaming. But can this last piece of the puzzle equal the overwhelming acclaim of its other pieces?\n\nTelltale's five episode series is self-admittedly more in tune with the Walking Dead comic books, and does not branch off of the television show. While set in the Walking Dead mythos, the plot and characters are original and unique. Furthermore, you do not even have to be a fan of the series in any form to appreciate this riveting, nerve-wracking journey. This review contains no spoilers but concerns the series as a whole, not the individual episodes. The review is broken up into segments with concise summaries immediately following each.\n\nGraphics\nPros:\n-Decent graphics for the price\n-Style is reminiscent of comic series\n-What little user interface there is, is partially customizable to tailor to your playstyle\n\nCons:\n-Nothing spectacular, no stand-out locations, just-enough-for-the-job visuals\n\nSound\nPros:\n-Voice actors exceptionally well suited for their respective characters\n-Script and acting for bulk of game is captivating\n\nCons:\n-Cannot skip dialogue, meaning thorough players will rehear a lot of potentially bland script\n\nPlot\nPros:\n-Huge focus on plot leads to a captivating drama\n-Player choices can shape character opinions, dialogue, and cutscenes\n-Each episode delivers a powerful punch of plot, but also contributes to the plot as a whole\n\nCons:\n-Hard pressed to think of any\n\nGameplay\nPros:\n-Gameplay choices lead to a plot tailored for you\n-Rewind feature makes it possible to second-guess your choices, if unhappy with outcome\n-If connected to the internet, choice synopsis at end of each episode compares you to others\n-Control over dialogue, “struggle” sequences, and suspenseful sequences immerse the player\n-Simple enough to be enjoyed by casual Walking Dead fans looking to enjoy this title\n-Few to no glitches or bugs\n\nCons:\n-Hardcore adventure players may not be satisfied with the puzzles, or lack thereof\n-Players not fond of visual novels may dislike the large focus on dialogue and plot\n-Slow readers may struggle with timed dialogue choices\n\nLength/Replay Value\nPros:\n-Although short, delivers a powerful gaming experience\n\nCons:\n-Not the best money-to-hours ratio\n-Very little replay value (full game – players may use rewind to experience different choices)\n\nTotal Score: 8.2/10","January 3, 2014","true","15.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have only played through this game once, but you could feel how the game not only set you in front of a choice but also expected you to deal with it. No good, no bad, just "hope you can live with the consequences", all with a story that you can't help but get emotionally invested in (keep tissues nearby). The game reflects on and compares your decisions throughout the game with gathered data from Telltale at the end of every episode if you have an internet connection.\n\nThe game focuses on story, in the purest way I've ever seen a game execute it. It still clings a little too much to the pace-killing puzzles of the Monkey Island era, but the puzzle areas are generally very small (the probably largest area in the game is a hallway, two rooms and a backyard) and the usual "use every item on every item on the screen until something happens" procedure is simplified by the compact and confined GUI.\n\nOther than that, you spend most of your time talking to people and watching cutscenes. Many cutscenes involve quicktime events to reenforce that you have to take account of your actions and promises. Have you promised to shoot someone? The game puts you back in control and expects you to pull the trigger with a mouse click. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ a guy in your party? You better defend yourself by smashing Q when he jumps on your throat.\n\nDialogs are often timed too to add to the tension, and give you the option to willingly stay silent when they are. In my opinion, the silent option adds very well to the immersion in a couple of conversations where none of the other options could accurately express what I/my character was thinking. The writing of the dialogs and the voice acting are excellent and create believable characters.\n\nThe game is very consistent and not only respects your choices, but also has some of the characters remember very well what you do. For example, you can be caught if you lie and contradict yourself in a later conversation. I've found no immersion or cohesion breaking bugs (Concelor Anderson anyone?), the game generally does a very good job at keeping the Fourth Wall intact once you've become used to the quicktime events.\n\nI think games are still figuring out how to perform incredible storytelling and The Walking Dead delivers an experience that I'm looking forward to see serving as an inspiration for a new generation of adventure games. I recommend this game wholeheartedly to everyone who is not ashamed of crying in front of a computer screen.\n\nP.S. I also highly recommend watching the Extra Credits Mini-Series on this game, starting with this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qizgjT4UXa4 - no spoilers.","August 11, 2014","true","19.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/recommended/207610/","maderschramm","Shotime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/","1157 products in account","Telltale's The Walking Dead is based on the canon of the hit TV Show and graphic novel series.  It is a point-and-click adventure game with quicktime elements - and it's a very good one.  The narrative, storytelling, and characterization is top notch and if one can refer to a story as "heavy" this game is more like having a pickup truck sitting on your chest.  It's a prime example of interactive storytelling and is an excellent model of how you can use the gaming medium to convey a story to an audience - even the camera angles it utilizes were wonderful, from staring at your reflection in a puddle as you beat someone's brain in to adding tension by having a skewed angle while you climb a ladder.  The game did have some pitfalls that comes with the point-and-click genre that it didn't avoicd unfortunately - repeatedly viewing things instead of acting on them/with them, repeating dialogue options accidentally without the ability to skip them, a few character and graphics glitches (I vividly remember speaking to an invisible Vernon and Kat cradling an invisible Duck in her arms) but besides a 4th wall breaking comic intervention these small negatives don't detract too much from the story as a whole.  The plot is very adult in nature and the gore and heavy themes are what you'd expect from a "Walking Dead" branded product.  What I found most interesting was the "illusion of choice" that seemed to be woven throughout the game.  Many people complain that every dialogue option and every choice you make should have an effect on the outcome of the game and many do; however, there are more than several situations in the game where no matter what you do something is going to go down in a certain way - many times in a way that could shock you.  As such, I recommend playing this game by the seat of your pants, don't reload, don't try again.  It's a more rewarding experience in the end since probably that one thing you didn't want to happen is going to happen regardless of what actions you take.  This can be seen as a pro or a con depending on your personality.  I find it a plus, as it allows Telltale's writers to weave a tighter narrative that has a much larger effect on the viewer than if everything turned into sunshine and rainbows for you (which is not going to happen anyway).  Leave it for a second playthrough if you must, but imagine this game as more interacting with a movie that you can steer around as you please to explore the world and interact with the characters in.\n\nSPOILER FOLLOWS - Finally the ending wasn't too fulfilling to me, it almost seems like Telltale was holding back for a future release.  I would have liked to see how your 'parenting' options throughout the episodes effected Clem, and allowed you to see what kind of person she becomes after the credits roll.  Even if her actions post ending were in a montage format that would have been fine, allowing you to see if Clem can survive in this world with the lessons you've taught her. /SPOILERS\n\nPros:\n\nGreat storytelling (narrative, themes, camerawork, "whole-package", etc.)\nHeavy, adult themes\n\nCons:\n\nMinor point-and-click pitfalls\nEnding didn't "wrap up" to my satisfaction\nSome characters (while good) felt a little static or seemed to be only "plot-devices"\n\nEven though I wasn't too impressed with the ending and the cons *appear* to outlist the pros this game is definitely worth a playthrough.  The story is great and this game is a great entrance for any gamer into interactive storytelling and what poing-and-click adventure games can be.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/recommended/207610/","csabber3","Green Lantern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/","174 products in account","The Walking Dead is the prototype game in the industry that shows that storytelling and characterization in video games can easily match those we see in movies or television series. Your choices matter here more than anywhere else and can lead to devastation or salvation when you expect it the least. The well written story and your attachment to the characters - main or supporting - will keep you moving forward and make you question every decision you've made before. It's a game of 'what ifs...'.\n\nThe story begins right on the first day when the epidemic starts. The main character is Lee Everett, who is on his way to jail in a police patrol vehicle when they hit a zombified humanoid they'll refer to as 'Walkers'. After a bit of wandering in a forest we meet Clementine, the eight year old girl whose nanny has also been turned and her parents are cut off in the faraway Savannah. The two start bonding right after they meet and Lee tries to look after her the best he knows. It's a really an emotionally powerful relationship from the gecko that only gets deeper. The game never tries to be unrealistic about the characters and their motives. Their goal is to survive no matter what, and I mean no matter. Not to find out what has happened or get some kind of cure. No. This makes it so interesting, you aren't Superman nor an action hero with unlimited bullets. The characters are real, everyday people that care about their families and themselves.\n\nThe game has an episodic character. It has 5 episodes each lasting around 2-3 hours that adds up to a total of 12-14 hours of gameplay. Your choices move the story forward and the game sometimes hits you with an impossible choice that will make you wonder minutes after it. Sometimes it's really hard to make a choice, but sometimes it might not even matter in the end. You just never know when somebody steps in and changes everything. It's a great balance of making up your mind and not knowing what would've happened if. What is spectacular about the game that the other characters have their own stories and plans too, and it might not tally with your's. The rest if the cast isn't there to make your life comfortable. They aren't soulless vessels that obey everything you say. They can act on their own, even if you don't like it and often confront your choices.\n\nAs a Telltale game it has a comic book character that is unquestionable unique, but hardly state of art. Neither artistically nor technically is a phenomenal game, but it has its own tone. It has other problems too. Frame-rate drops are annoying and camera angle changes can result in a momentary freeze of screen. On the audio front the situation is much better. The music and the voice acting is top notch, that supports the deep and emotional story.\n\nTelltale has hit the mark with The Walking Dead: Season 1. It's a spectacular point-and-click game where puzzles are secondary to the story. Yes, there will be times when you have to ask questions like, 'how to make this happen?' or 'how to make that work?', but those are only evanescent. The real question that you'll ask all the time is 'what is the right decision?' But you'll find out that there isn't one. It's a cruel world where everybody tries to survive and some tries to retain their humanity. If you're trying to find a superb interactive story, look no further, because The Walking Dead is a must have experience.\n\nRating: 84/100; Replay Value: 5/5; To Beat: 12-14 hours.","January 12, 2014","true","14.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Only recently I got it on sale. WORDS CAN NOT EVEN EXPRESS HOW AMAZING THIS GAME IS. The best part about the game is that it's not just about the zombie killing. There is little to no gameplay, but that is what makes the game so great. The game often has you make decisions in the heat of the moment so you need to think about all the possible options and how they will effect the story line in the future, and how other characters will respond/ react to your decisions. it is so amazing to see how the story unfolds based on the decisions you make. Often you may regret them but thats the whole beauty of it. Another aspect of the game I love is the graphics. Although they are nothing that great they remind me like a comic book. The walking Dead essentaly puts you in the middle of an episode of the show so it's cool to decide what you will do, it's like the choose your own adventure books we all used to read back in grade school! All in all I enjoyed playing the game and would often find my self staring at the screen in shock or cussing at myself for a crappy decision.

I enjoyed it as a whole and I recall a lot of it despite playing the 5 seasons over approximately 18 months.\n\nThere are some great characters and some great situations. The game holds your hand a lot, but it's mainly a story-telling experience anyway - the only issue I had with the gameplay was the lengthy *actions* that can trigger if I clicked something twice, which you might do if you think that your character (Lee) might have the same insight you have (not often the case). Nonetheless, the game is fun and I recommend you play it, though probably picked up on a good sale tbh.\n\nMy biggest peeve was that a good number of episodes were driven by character interactions between your group, but the game never presented me with the option I wanted (namely who I should be accusing). I found it weird as much of the game was about managing relationships AND ACCUSATIONS, but the time that I most wanted to accuse somebody of the poison that saw massive change (and the loss of the single group member that I wanted to keep), there was no option to remove the single most destructive group member (my opinion for a while before that happened, and ultimately proven by the end of the game to be your *worst* team member).\n\n\nI hope Telltale Games grow a pair and tell their funding groups that they want to make a more ambitious game. From what I've heard, they may already have done so.","June 13, 2014","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With a different pace and style than many games, this exquisite piece of game will give you such an experience that you don't get in many titles, especially on the Zombie/Survival genre. Based on your actual desicion making, your first experience will give you a sense of responsibility for every action you take, and will sumerge you into the story and develop a sense of caring for every character. Being a huge fan of The Walking Dead comic series, this game really got to me on the story level and I definitely recommend every fan of the genre should try it at least once.","January 4, 2013","true","17.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When I first saw that it was  developed by Telltale games I though it would be a  just a bog standard point & click adventure game, which it turned out not to be;  it's sort of half way between a p&p and a  third person action game (with some first person viewpoints).    I was immediately  struck by the art style which reminded me a lot of Borderlands and Street Fighter 4 in its   pseudo cartoon - watercolour washed   graphics.  The voice acting is brilliant accentuating  the  emotions that run throughout the game which are very powerful.   The way you choose to play the game, i.e. your  actions and choices affect how the story plays out across the entire series, making this  a game that has loads of replayability potential.\n\nI never thought I'd be saying this about   an adventure game, but I've enjoyed playing this more than other zombie games e.g. Left 4 Dead, Dead Island and the Resident Evil  franchise.","October 10, 2012","true","7.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Progression is simple, the puzzles smart and logical, and the controls are barely more complex than your average point-and-click — but it's hard nonetheless. The difficulty arises not from the actual game itself, but from the choices it forces you to make as a player. You will make mistakes. You'll wish you could take them back, but you can't. This is the world your characters live in, and the choices you make can't be unmade, only lived with.\n\nIt's rare to see a game so focused on the psychological aspects of its design. There are few moments in The Walking Dead where your skill as a gamer or your ability to survive will let you stand apart from the average player. Instead, what defines your experience is not how well you carry out your actions but how well you decide what course of action you are going to take. And nothing is more frightening, more difficult, or more powerful than knowing there is nothing you can do to change the consequences of your mistakes.\n\nAll you can do is hope that the choices you make are the right ones, and carry on.","December 23, 2013","true","15.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You know what’s best for yourself as well as for the people around you. Right?\n\nRight. Let’s put you to the test.”\n\nThat’s what The Walking Dead is essentially about. What we’re looking at is… †checks her game record† …a 14-hour game-movie-story. For most people this will be an exceptionally intense experience. This is far less about standard gaming than it is about storytelling, & the story being told will put you through a handful. That’s what it means to do.\n\nAs the story unfolds you’re confronted with many decisions, most of which are neither easy to make nor to be taken lightly. Nearly all of them you have to make under genuine pressure. The game doesn’t judge; this is up to yourself. It, however, observes carefully. Even though not all of your decisions seem to have a massive & immediate influence on what happens next, everything you do is noted.\n\nThe Walking Dead as a story has quite a radical way of handling its protagonists. Something similar you might get to see in a horror movie… The game doesn’t make much of an effort to wait for you to catch up. The pressure is on everyone; on the people inside the story as well as on you, the outsider playing the game. It’s a good thing that there are several chapters/episodes, & finishing one of them does not, immediately push you into the next. So you get breathers. Time to think, time to look back, even a chance to actually go back in time & do things differently if you so decide. It’s still furiously intense, fiercely confrontational. If you make your way through this & it makes you feel like you just got pushed through a mixer, don’t worry; everything’s purrfectly fine.\n\nSo you think you’re strong. Right? You think you’re a toughie, a hero, a leader. Right?\n\nThen go ahead, try this. You'll have to prove it to this story.\n\n\n-†kali","November 28, 2013","true","28.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Game explores interactions in a closed group of people and you often are forced to make hard decisions whenever you like it or not. What i noticed early on that not every stranger you meet in game is honest or open with you. Often you'll be faced with situations that requires somekind of trust and you just cannot trust someone for whatever reason. Everything you do or say has consequences in one way or another and sooner or later you'll have to face them. At the end of every chapter you get little chart showing your choices and what other players picked.\nMain protagonist is Lee. A black guy who has a secret which he (you) can reveal to the rest of group or not. Lee early on in the game finds a little girl Clementine. After Lee finds Clem he promises her to find her parents and they travel together from then on. Even though Lee isn't Clementine's dad he sure does care about her like it's his own daughter, giving her symphaty and tips when she need it. The game is worth to play just to see how those two interact. Also note that Clementine isn't boring nor annoying for a child character. Possibly best portrayed child character ever in video games.\nOverall I'd give this game 10/10 even though this doesn't feel like a "real" game but I have to question what is a game? This is exemplar of "chose your own adventure" book. Story has great pacing, nice soundtrack and tension where it's needed. It is unbelievable how good this game story is so I highly recommend to play it for everyone even those who don't play many games.\n\n","November 4, 2013","true","13.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The walking dead game was a joruney and a rollercoaster of emotions through out the whole 5 episodes. It has it's plot twists and a sad but beautiful ending that will make you want to try the season 2 of the walking dead which I suggest you buy. This game's story mode alone made the full price worth it.\n\n- Options 9/10\nI wish there would be more graphic options for the game and some more gameplay options but other than that it's good. Offers the obligatory subtitles option and plenty of options regarding hints and help.\n\n- Controls 8/10\nI had moments of frustration when I got couldn't move the camera to the way I was going and the keyboard controls in general in my opinion are weird. I definitely suggest using a controller for this one.\n\n- Gameplay 9/10\nAs much as I liked the story the gameplay makes the game unique in it's own way and makes you want to play more of it.\nThe choices you make in the game, the lines you choose, the people you trust make up the ending. There need to be more games in which you choose the path you take, will you go with the whole group or go alone? Will you kill this guy or walk away? It all matters, and that is what I like about this game. I expirienced a glitch at one point where I couldn't connect to the game even though it's a singleplayer game what fixed this issue was before clicking start upon launch I pressed Alt+Tab and it worked like a charm.\n\n- Final Verdict 10/10\nThis is a must play game for everyone, I recommend this game for any gamer to try at sometime in their life.","January 29, 2015","true","21.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/recommended/207610/","maderschramm","Shotime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/","1157 products in account","Telltale's The Walking Dead is based on the canon of the hit TV Show and graphic novel series.  It is a point-and-click adventure game with quicktime elements - and it's a very good one.  The narrative, storytelling, and characterization is top notch and if one can refer to a story as "heavy" this game is more like having a pickup truck sitting on your chest.  It's a prime example of interactive storytelling and is an excellent model of how you can use the gaming medium to convey a story to an audience - even the camera angles it utilizes were wonderful, from staring at your reflection in a puddle as you beat someone's brain in to adding tension by having a skewed angle while you climb a ladder.  The game did have some pitfalls that comes with the point-and-click genre that it didn't avoicd unfortunately - repeatedly viewing things instead of acting on them/with them, repeating dialogue options accidentally without the ability to skip them, a few character and graphics glitches (I vividly remember speaking to an invisible Vernon and Kat cradling an invisible Duck in her arms) but besides a 4th wall breaking comic intervention these small negatives don't detract too much from the story as a whole.  The plot is very adult in nature and the gore and heavy themes are what you'd expect from a "Walking Dead" branded product.  What I found most interesting was the "illusion of choice" that seemed to be woven throughout the game.  Many people complain that every dialogue option and every choice you make should have an effect on the outcome of the game and many do; however, there are more than several situations in the game where no matter what you do something is going to go down in a certain way - many times in a way that could shock you.  As such, I recommend playing this game by the seat of your pants, don't reload, don't try again.  It's a more rewarding experience in the end since probably that one thing you didn't want to happen is going to happen regardless of what actions you take.  This can be seen as a pro or a con depending on your personality.  I find it a plus, as it allows Telltale's writers to weave a tighter narrative that has a much larger effect on the viewer than if everything turned into sunshine and rainbows for you (which is not going to happen anyway).  Leave it for a second playthrough if you must, but imagine this game as more interacting with a movie that you can steer around as you please to explore the world and interact with the characters in.\n\nSPOILER FOLLOWS - Finally the ending wasn't too fulfilling to me, it almost seems like Telltale was holding back for a future release.  I would have liked to see how your 'parenting' options throughout the episodes effected Clem, and allowed you to see what kind of person she becomes after the credits roll.  Even if her actions post ending were in a montage format that would have been fine, allowing you to see if Clem can survive in this world with the lessons you've taught her. /SPOILERS\n\nPros:\n\nGreat storytelling (narrative, themes, camerawork, "whole-package", etc.)\nHeavy, adult themes\n\nCons:\n\nMinor point-and-click pitfalls\nEnding didn't "wrap up" to my satisfaction\nSome characters (while good) felt a little static or seemed to be only "plot-devices"\n\nEven though I wasn't too impressed with the ending and the cons *appear* to outlist the pros this game is definitely worth a playthrough.  The story is great and this game is a great entrance for any gamer into interactive storytelling and what poing-and-click adventure games can be.

Honestly I find most of them outright stupid, and with the zombie hype that has been going on the last few years the genre as a whole mostly leaves a foul taste in my mouth. But somehow I got talked into watching this show called "The Walking Dead" and it totally blew me over. Well written, great character building and feelings flying all over the board. I found it amazing that something related to zombies could be THAT good.\n\nThen I learned about that this series, or rather the universe of that series, was going to be carried over to an episodic adventure type game by no other than Telltale Games. A company that has helped keeping the adventure genre of gaming alive when it felt almost extinct. As a BIG adventure game fan I have happily supported this company by getting mostly everything they have put out, and that was also mainly the reason I got this series as well.\n\nI honestly had very little expectation of how this game series would be as I failed to see how it even would work to transfer the great writing and suspense that I experienced in the TV-series to an adventure type game. Even though I read good reviews of it I kept putting off playing it. I was absolutely certain that it was going to leave me disappointed.\n\nWell, finally I got around to play it, and now I kick myself fo not playing it sooner. I can not believe how good this game is. I don't think I can remember better storywriting in any game I've played before. You really get to know the characters you meet and you get feelings and opinions about them. You're forced to make tough decisions in critical moments and you can never be sure if you did the right thing. Well, there is not really any clear right or wrong. There is mostly various shades of grey. Not only that, but your decisions affect the ones around you, and they will remember what you did or didn't do, and the game itself shapes itself around all this and creates different routes and takes on what you experience while playing through it.\n\nAll characters are masterfully voiced by a selection of excellent voice actors that helps making the experience close to magical. You'll find yourself laughing, crying, yelling at the screen and acting in panic. And you'll probably feel that you're in the middle of it all.\n\nNow, it has to be said that this game is probably not for everybody. I can see, and even understand that people might find the gameplay itself to be a bit dull or repetetive and probably feel there is little gameplay at all. If you hate QTE's then you might want to shy away if you do not appreciate a good story. Also, even though I quite like the artstyle I see some people being thrown off a bit by the comic like cel shading, and I believe the game would be even better with a bit more realistic touch. It certainly looks good enough in its own way and should in any way be avoided with that as a reason.\n\nI consider this game to be one of those games you absolutely should not allow yourself to miss out on. It is a game for the history books and you would want to tell your grandchildren that you were there to play it.\n\nI rate this game 10/10\n\nRecommended for everybody who appreciate video games, and their mothers too.\n\nHappy Gaming\n\nTJ","March 20, 2015","true","24.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Essentially The Walking Dead is an episodic point-and-click adventure game with action sequences. More importantly, it's a captivating and touching story of a man and a little girl trying to survive a zombie apocalypse.\n\nThe puzzles are straightforward, the action sequences are very easy, there's no real challenge to be had in this game - and that's a good thing. The Walking Dead is ALL about the experience, and that experience is sensational. You make decisions for your character that influence not only the events in that episode, but also the overarching story. There are some grueling decisions to be made and you don't have all day to decide, which adds a lot of tension to the scenes.\n\nIf you've seen the TV show or read the comics then this will be an even better experience. The game takes place prior to the TV show but in the same area, with locations and characters from the TV show making cameos, albeit with different voice actors.\n\nThe 400 Days DLC is a sixth episode that is mostly unconnected to the original season. You play as five different characters in short stories that come together in a final arc. It's worth your while, but not as long as the other episodes and the actual ramifications of your choices in the DLC won't be felt until season 2.\n\nTL;DR:\nBuy it now!","August 29, 2013","true","14.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The walking dead game was a joruney and a rollercoaster of emotions through out the whole 5 episodes. It has it's plot twists and a sad but beautiful ending that will make you want to try the season 2 of the walking dead which I suggest you buy. This game's story mode alone made the full price worth it.\n\n- Options 9/10\nI wish there would be more graphic options for the game and some more gameplay options but other than that it's good. Offers the obligatory subtitles option and plenty of options regarding hints and help.\n\n- Controls 8/10\nI had moments of frustration when I got couldn't move the camera to the way I was going and the keyboard controls in general in my opinion are weird. I definitely suggest using a controller for this one.\n\n- Gameplay 9/10\nAs much as I liked the story the gameplay makes the game unique in it's own way and makes you want to play more of it.\nThe choices you make in the game, the lines you choose, the people you trust make up the ending. There need to be more games in which you choose the path you take, will you go with the whole group or go alone? Will you kill this guy or walk away? It all matters, and that is what I like about this game. I expirienced a glitch at one point where I couldn't connect to the game even though it's a singleplayer game what fixed this issue was before clicking start upon launch I pressed Alt+Tab and it worked like a charm.\n\n- Final Verdict 10/10\nThis is a must play game for everyone, I recommend this game for any gamer to try at sometime in their life.","January 29, 2015","true","21.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You decide what dialogues you see fit for the situation and the actions you choose affects your relationship towards the other characters.\n\nIf you want to embody your own personality into the protagonist (Lee Everett) then go for it. You might even know what it feels like to make tough decisions and what it feels to make big sacrifices. This game is not just choosing dialogues but also interacting with the environment. (but not like Nancy Drew)\n\nThe story is totally very good. It would make you feel like your watching the series itself. The ending is very sad and touching. It can make you shed tears.\n\nThis game is really worth buying but I recommend that you buy it when it's on sale (preferrably a daily deal) so that you'll be able to buy the DLC and Season 2 for a cheaper price.\n\nThe 400 Days DLC is not worth its price since it's quite very short for the 5 additional characters but what's good about it is that the actions you chose on Season 1 and 400 days will be carried over to Season 2. That's why it's worth buying Season 1, 400 Days and Season 2 altogether. Overall, it's a great game with a totally touching story. By the way, I'm not a fan of the series but I highly recommend it to everyone.\n\nStory: 10/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nGraphics: 10/10\nMusic: 10/10\n\nOverall: 9.8/10","January 8, 2015","true","36.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bombkirby/recommended/207610/","bombkirby","Bombkirby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bombkirby/","50 products in account","The Walking Dead is an interesting visual novel/point and click type of game. When I first went into it I thought it was about  talking to my group and trying to change their fates through our interactions. I was horribly disappointing to realize no matter what you do or what you say, the outcome is always the same.\n\nThere is a huge amount of "illusion of choice" There is one point in the game where you have to choose between saving this guy or saving this girl. When you save one, the other dies and the story goes in a different direction and encourages replaying the game! Right? Wrong. Not twenty minutes later, the person you save dies anyways. In the end no matter your choice, both end up dead. There was no choice! This pattern continued through the whole game, I'd be promoted with a choice and the inevitable would eventually happen. I finished the game with a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nThat is until I saw a discussion online about Kenny, one of the characters. The thread started off with someone saying how awesome Kenny was.He always had your back, was friendly, sacrificed himself, he was cool. I agreed. However most people in the thread said he was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! I was completely in disagreement! They were even listing quotes he NEVER said in the game! That was when it hit me. The events of the game are unchangeable but the characters and the way they interact with you is completely different for each player depending on your choices. Kenny was a nice guy in my game but a jerk in many other people's games. It made discussion about the game a ton of fun since everyone's experience with each character was completely different. Some characters tell some players things other players will never hear them say.\n\nSure the events were out of your control but that kind of game would be a little high budget for Telltale, so I think what they pulled off was pretty well done all things considered. My advice is do NOT go into the game with the thought that you can change the outcome of certain character's gruesome fates, but you can change their personalities, and compare the differences and similarities between your characters and your friend's characters' personalities. Your "best bro" in your game could be your friend's biggest rival or worst enemy!","March 5, 2015","true","12.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When I first saw that it was  developed by Telltale games I though it would be a  just a bog standard point & click adventure game, which it turned out not to be;  it's sort of half way between a p&p and a  third person action game (with some first person viewpoints).    I was immediately  struck by the art style which reminded me a lot of Borderlands and Street Fighter 4 in its   pseudo cartoon - watercolour washed   graphics.  The voice acting is brilliant accentuating  the  emotions that run throughout the game which are very powerful.   The way you choose to play the game, i.e. your  actions and choices affect how the story plays out across the entire series, making this  a game that has loads of replayability potential.\n\nI never thought I'd be saying this about   an adventure game, but I've enjoyed playing this more than other zombie games e.g. Left 4 Dead, Dead Island and the Resident Evil  franchise.","October 10, 2012","true","7.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The writers created a story which was not only captivating but an amazing emotional experience.\n\nThe Walking Dead is a comic-book drawn style adventure game in which the choices you make tailor the story you play going forward and continuously shape the people around you and your game play experience.\n\nEvery action has consequences and you never can please everyone.\n\n-----------------\n-- Gameplay\n-----------------\nThe game mechanics are nice and simple. The story progresses through point-click action and mainly through dialog with the people you encounter.\n\nDuring the dialogs you will be presented with several choices of answers.\nEach answer may or may not have consequences and alters how other people see you, trust you or even start disliking you.\n\nEvery now and then you will end up in a heavy story-changing scenario in which the story going forward is altered quite strongly.\nYou might need to make a choice to save one or another person, run or fight or other difficult choice.\nThose choices alter the story quite drastic in places to the extend whereby you might end up continuing your story with different people then if you had made different choices or people start treating you completely different from that moment on.\n\n-----------------\n-- The Story\n-----------------\n\nThe game places you in control of Lee a man on his way to prison as the story begins and has no idea yet what is happening.\nAs you are trying to deal with the world as it now is you stumble across an 8 year old girl named Clementine who you will decide to help out and team up with.\n\nFor the duration of the story your relationship with Clementine and others you meet evolves and are shaped continuously based on the choices you make and how you treat each person.\n\nI don't want to give to much of the main background story away so I'm not going into to much details.\nLet's just say, for the rest of the game you and Clementine will come across other people and groups, some highly irritating and disturbed while others are more neutral and well meaning, though you will find it hard to quickly know who to trust and who you can't.\n\nQuite often you will find yourself in situations you wish you could make different choices then the ones presented or make choices you know might not be right but need to be made.\n\n-----------------\n-- Summary\n-----------------\n\nPersonally I can only say that TellTale and the Writes have delivered something very simplistic but yet so wonderful you are feeling you are writing your own story which will grab you, slowly pulling you deeper and deeper into this emotional roller coaster ride and will not let you go.\n\nBy the end of Episode 5 you will just find yourself staring blankly at the credits slowly processing this whole experience.\nWell, that what it was like for me and I'm already looking very much forward to December 17th to continue on.\n\nI cannot recommend this game highly enough and hope you will enjoy it as much as I have.","June 6, 2014","true","25.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","5"

Or maybe you're thinking: Point and click? Check please! Or maybe you're not too excited about the month to month episode thing? Or maybe you didn't like some of Telltale's past titles?\n\nAnd you know what, some of your concerns may even be valid; it really depends on your expectations for this awesome release, so let me try to set some of those expectations. First of all, The Walking Dead game is for and will be loved by--and loved by is a guarantee, graphic novel readers--any true fan of Robert Kirkman's source material. Anyone looking to run and gun down zombies will not get that out of this game. You certainly don't have to have read the book or seen the show to enjoy this game; just be sure that you are planning to get into and be part of a story-rich experience.\n\nThe Walking Dead game is no Burn Zombie Burn or some other bash as many zombies' brains in as possible game. This game is a lot more of an RPG than a shooter.\n\nYou start the game the day the zombie apocalypse begins concurrently from the start of the comic book series. You play as Lee, and just as in the book (and in the TV show) where the main character Rick was initially thrown into a chaotic journey by himself to find other survivorsthat's you as Lee in The Walking Dead game.\n\nThere are plenty of action sequences, but your time in this game is mostly spent literally being a part of the story making some tough (and some not so tough) decisions. It's the tough decisions that will affect how the rest of the game unfolds for you, and you'll have to live with the consequences of every option you choose.\n\nThe game does give you the option of "rewinding" back to a specific checkpoint, and you can go forward from there and choose a different option that overwrites your original decision if that's your style. But I won't do that until I complete the entire series. I tried to make the main character call "the right move" when presented with choice; but there is a time limit when decision time comes, and sometimes you may regret a hasty decision. For example, you'll have to choose one life over another twice during just the first episode, and I'm not sure that I made the "right" choice in one of those moments. But I will live with my decision until after playing through the entire series just to "keep it real." The game sure does get an A for replay value.\n\nJust as in the graphic novel (and the TV show), the story is much less about zombies and more about what happens to society, its morals, laws and standards when government is lost and the planet becomes mostly uninhabitable. But this time you don't just watch it unfold on paper or on your TV screen; in this game you're part of the storyyou control your integrity, your morality and ultimately your destiny. And there's real, heartfelt emotion in The Walking Dead game combined with very believable scenarios. Color me a sissy, but I actually got a little misty over one of the decisions that "I had to" make.\n\nThe Walking Dead game is excellentespecially for just a point and click. It's as gritty and graphic as the comic book, and it's very story-rich. The graphics are appropriately very comic-bookesque. I really do feel like I'm part of a different story arc in the freakin' book! Plus anyone clamoring for a Platinum Trophy (or whatever the top achievement for getting all in-game achievements is on your platform) could get an easy one here; all the trophies are unmissable simply by finishing all the chapters in every episode.\n\nThe Walking Dead game is a deep, personal and emotional adventure.","November 11, 2015","true","63.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I only watched the first and half of the second season of The Walking Dead TV-show and each other (post-)apocalyptic scenario (as War against Machines, Nuclear Holocaust, Alien Invasion or global Eco-Disaster) I prefer over a zombie apocalypse - both in real life and in video games. But if you are interested in a strong narrative and a video game triggering emotions like a great movie would do, then there is no way around Telltale's The Walking Dead.\n\nThe gameplay is minimalistic. You click on already highlighted objects/persons to push the story forward but not to solve any puzzles or riddles or fill your inventory as you may expect from an adventure game. Even "Heavy Rain" was more of a game than The Walking Dead is, but this is interactive storytelling at its best.\nThe great voice-acting makes all the characters you meet reasonable and authentic. Actually Melissa Hutchison (who speaks Clementine) won the “Best Performance by a Female" at the 2013 Spike Video Games Awards.\nOh well, talking about Clementine. Usually children in video games are just plain annoying or they are drawn in an unlikely precocious way acting like adults with their bodyscale set to 0.6. Not so here. I can't imagine the cold-hearted kitty-slaying villain you have to be to not care about Clementine and do whatever it takes to guide her safely through this horror. It broke my heart when we had to part.\n\nSo eventually you will figure that all your gameplay- and dialogue choices won't even change the outcome of the story but just how your fellow companions stand towards you and whether if they like you or not. And maybe that is the most important lesson we can distill off The Walking Dead for the upcoming apocalypse – both in real life and in video games.\n\nFirst playthrough: ~15 hrs.\n\nHere is a three episode mini-series from Extra Credits about various topics relating to Telltale's The Walking Dead.

There are a few puzzles, some quicktime sequences to keep you on your toes, but more than anything it's a game that sells itself entirely on the strength of its narrative. If that's not what you're looking for, this won't be for you.\n\nCharacter models and animations are a bit dated, lip-syncing is pretty average, nothing about this game on a technical level really stands out. But as an interactive story, I can honestly say I've never felt so invested in a group of fictional characters before. Everyone is flawed but usually sympathetic, and the protagonist and his constant child companion are some of the most likeable characters in games.\n\nEven if Lee isn't a generic "everyman", you learn to very quickly identify with him and see things from his perspective, and Clementine is perhaps the only well-done child character in any video game ever. She's realistic, she's cute, she's scared, and she looks up to you. Every action you end up taking will end up going through the filter of "what will Clem think?", and the writing and acting does a wonderful job making you really live with your decisions.\n\nDespite the many player choices, this isn't a heavily branching story. The overall plot remains relatively the same regardless of what you do, though the fate of the supporting cast can vary. More than a branching plot, it wants to make it feel like your story, that everything that happens is a result of your choices, and it loves to make you feel guilty, whatever you end up doing. The writing and acting are excellent, and it's an emotionally brutal story in a way so rarely pulled off in games. Even if you don't like this kind of game, even if you don't even like zombies, this is a devastatingly sad tale that really needs to be experienced for yourself, if you can see past the limitations of the game built to tell it.","September 18, 2015","true","17.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You decide what dialogues you see fit for the situation and the actions you choose affects your relationship towards the other characters.\n\nIf you want to embody your own personality into the protagonist (Lee Everett) then go for it. You might even know what it feels like to make tough decisions and what it feels to make big sacrifices. This game is not just choosing dialogues but also interacting with the environment. (but not like Nancy Drew)\n\nThe story is totally very good. It would make you feel like your watching the series itself. The ending is very sad and touching. It can make you shed tears.\n\nThis game is really worth buying but I recommend that you buy it when it's on sale (preferrably a daily deal) so that you'll be able to buy the DLC and Season 2 for a cheaper price.\n\nThe 400 Days DLC is not worth its price since it's quite very short for the 5 additional characters but what's good about it is that the actions you chose on Season 1 and 400 days will be carried over to Season 2. That's why it's worth buying Season 1, 400 Days and Season 2 altogether. Overall, it's a great game with a totally touching story. By the way, I'm not a fan of the series but I highly recommend it to everyone.\n\nStory: 10/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nGraphics: 10/10\nMusic: 10/10\n\nOverall: 9.8/10","January 8, 2015","true","36.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, as the story progresses, choices definitely feel like they have more impact, endgame especially.\n\nand No. 2, the engine isn't perfect.  For instance, when the player has made several neutral-decisions... but the overall allignment balance may be either to one side or the other, some dialogue choices by the NPC can feel like they came out of nowhere.  This sometimes leads to the overall story feeling a little bit stilted and disingenuous.\n\nHowever, these 2 drawbacks (at least for me) weren't dealbreakers; the story still flowed fairly well and the whole game I was constantly struggling with what was the "right" decision.  Emotions ran high during many of the major turning-points in the story, and I can't lie, my eyes did start swelling at the chapter 5 finale...\n\nOverall, It has a great story that is well worth experiencing, and unless the two above mentioned flaws are deal-breakers for you, I whole-heartedly endorse picking up a copy of this.  Looking forward to picking up Season 2 this upcoming winter sale.","November 10, 2015","true","16.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

They're mostly just people too stupid to realise what kind of game this is and are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and moaning because they thought they were getting one of the ten thousand zombie games that are all identical and instead spent their money on something with depth. That's pretty much the point of this review because I haven't really played it long enough to critique the entire game. My reviews are often anti-negative reviews, kind of a motif.\n\nThis is basically an interactive miniseries, there's a lot of QTE's and choices to make, that might not be some peoples cup of tea, fine. That's okay but nearly every negative review is just about how "it's barely a game" and that's not a good enough reason to not recommend The Walking Dead. These kind of reviews are as valid as saying "this is a ♥♥♥♥ cup of tea" when you're drinking hot chocolate. You just have to be aware of what kind of game this is.\n\nAlso I've encountered no graphical glitches or problems that couldn't be solved by turning the settings down a smidge, my pc is currently slightly less than average. Not for long though. Read another review for a more in depth look at the actual game, frankly I can't be bothered. Maybe another time.\n\nEdit: I understand that this game tailors its story to your decisions and so, my story ends in episode 2 of season one. I found myself in an unwinnable situation with no options to... well just no options but death or an everlasting standoff. I even re-did the entire section and did things differently but I still had no way of getting past it. I eventually resorted to asking the friend who recommended the game to me what I had to do, even with the assistance of Google it was just not doing anything but killing me. I'm assuming the game actually glitched but I refuse to continue, I accept this as my unique ending to the series. I'll never find out what happens to Clem but hey, that's life. Other than this issue it's still a great experience though and I still recommend it if it's on sale. And if it's your kinda thing, don't go ♥♥♥♥♥ing 'cos "it's not really a game". It's still entertaining dammit!\n\nAnother Edit: This is slowly turning into a blog instead of a review. I gave in to peer pressure from the same friend I mentioned earlier and tried again. It turns out it was actually the controller that was messing things up for me. The analogue stick is just a little bit buggered and so I had to use the keyboard just for that bit. So in episode 2 if you get stuck near the end during a section that involves just walking forward slowly try using the keyboard if you keep dying. Timing is important and can be a bit tricky with an old controller. I shall continue playing and if any more issues come up I'll add them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nabbed/recommended/207610/","nabbed","kk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nabbed/","53 products in account","If you're thinking about getting this game, you're probably thinking some things like: Uh oh a game based on a book/TV show? That usually doesn't work. Or maybe you're thinking: Point and click? Check please! Or maybe you're not too excited about the month to month episode thing? Or maybe you didn't like some of Telltale's past titles?\n\nAnd you know what, some of your concerns may even be valid; it really depends on your expectations for this awesome release, so let me try to set some of those expectations. First of all, The Walking Dead game is for and will be loved by--and loved by is a guarantee, graphic novel readers--any true fan of Robert Kirkman's source material. Anyone looking to run and gun down zombies will not get that out of this game. You certainly don't have to have read the book or seen the show to enjoy this game; just be sure that you are planning to get into and be part of a story-rich experience.\n\nThe Walking Dead game is no Burn Zombie Burn or some other bash as many zombies' brains in as possible game. This game is a lot more of an RPG than a shooter.\n\nYou start the game the day the zombie apocalypse begins concurrently from the start of the comic book series. You play as Lee, and just as in the book (and in the TV show) where the main character Rick was initially thrown into a chaotic journey by himself to find other survivorsthat's you as Lee in The Walking Dead game.\n\nThere are plenty of action sequences, but your time in this game is mostly spent literally being a part of the story making some tough (and some not so tough) decisions. It's the tough decisions that will affect how the rest of the game unfolds for you, and you'll have to live with the consequences of every option you choose.\n\nThe game does give you the option of "rewinding" back to a specific checkpoint, and you can go forward from there and choose a different option that overwrites your original decision if that's your style. But I won't do that until I complete the entire series. I tried to make the main character call "the right move" when presented with choice; but there is a time limit when decision time comes, and sometimes you may regret a hasty decision. For example, you'll have to choose one life over another twice during just the first episode, and I'm not sure that I made the "right" choice in one of those moments. But I will live with my decision until after playing through the entire series just to "keep it real." The game sure does get an A for replay value.\n\nJust as in the graphic novel (and the TV show), the story is much less about zombies and more about what happens to society, its morals, laws and standards when government is lost and the planet becomes mostly uninhabitable. But this time you don't just watch it unfold on paper or on your TV screen; in this game you're part of the storyyou control your integrity, your morality and ultimately your destiny. And there's real, heartfelt emotion in The Walking Dead game combined with very believable scenarios. Color me a sissy, but I actually got a little misty over one of the decisions that "I had to" make.\n\nThe Walking Dead game is excellentespecially for just a point and click. It's as gritty and graphic as the comic book, and it's very story-rich. The graphics are appropriately very comic-bookesque. I really do feel like I'm part of a different story arc in the freakin' book! Plus anyone clamoring for a Platinum Trophy (or whatever the top achievement for getting all in-game achievements is on your platform) could get an easy one here; all the trophies are unmissable simply by finishing all the chapters in every episode.\n\nThe Walking Dead game is a deep, personal and emotional adventure.","November 11, 2015","true","63.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game gives you the same feeling of wanting to know what the next chapter will bring as any other amazing series.\n\nThe visuals are great, and the story will take you on an emotional rollercoaster.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misterbob/recommended/207610/","misterbob","misterbob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misterbob/","514 products in account","Excellent storytelling throughout is where this game is really strong. You do begin to actually care about a lot of the characters which is something most video games are lacking (although admittedly, a lot don't aim for this). This is where the ame truly excels; it will scare you, shock you, make you laugh, probably cry, and in the end you'll just genuinely enjoy it (and after all, isn't that what we all play video games for?).\n\nThe decisions you make as you go through are also a big selling point. the developers have clearly worked very hard on this aspect, and your decisions will have a very real effect on the game. The decision points are well designed, with almost all of them being difficult choices that really make you think about what you would do in the situation. You also get a breakdown at the end of each episode of how many other players made the same choices as you, which is a nice touch.\n\nThere is also a very unique graphical style to this game, at first it seems a bit strange, and you could almost accuse the graphics of being "bad", but it gives a feeling to the game like no other, which can only be a good thing.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit lacklustre, and at times frustrating; you'll probably find yourself thinking you didn't really deserve to die there more than a few times. This gameplay often consists of quicktime events, so it isn't exactly the most revolutionary game in that regard, but they are at least used to relatively good effect though; they seem to be mainly used as a way to keep the player engaged, often occuring when you don't expect it and making you spring into action. This, in part, means that you don't get bored during a long play session, and the episodic nature of the game serves to further break it up; playing through one episode takes a couple of hours, much more and you'd start to get bored.\n\nTo sum up; this game feels very different to any other I've played. The storytelling is fantastic, the graphics are neither good or bad, but certainly different, and while the gameplay leaves a bit to be desired, it takes a back seat so it really won't bother you. I would recommend this game to anyone 9/10","December 8, 2013","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You decide what dialogues you see fit for the situation and the actions you choose affects your relationship towards the other characters.\n\nIf you want to embody your own personality into the protagonist (Lee Everett) then go for it. You might even know what it feels like to make tough decisions and what it feels to make big sacrifices. This game is not just choosing dialogues but also interacting with the environment. (but not like Nancy Drew)\n\nThe story is totally very good. It would make you feel like your watching the series itself. The ending is very sad and touching. It can make you shed tears.\n\nThis game is really worth buying but I recommend that you buy it when it's on sale (preferrably a daily deal) so that you'll be able to buy the DLC and Season 2 for a cheaper price.\n\nThe 400 Days DLC is not worth its price since it's quite very short for the 5 additional characters but what's good about it is that the actions you chose on Season 1 and 400 days will be carried over to Season 2. That's why it's worth buying Season 1, 400 Days and Season 2 altogether. Overall, it's a great game with a totally touching story. By the way, I'm not a fan of the series but I highly recommend it to everyone.\n\nStory: 10/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nGraphics: 10/10\nMusic: 10/10\n\nOverall: 9.8/10","January 8, 2015","true","36.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The raw emotion that this game makes you feel through it's powerful story telling is unparallaled to others of it's kind. You will feel regrets no matter how many good choices you make. You always wonder "what if". You will become attached to characters only to inevitably lose them.

It was recommended to me as a great story driven game with deep charcters. And it is exactly that, but more!\n\nNot really enjoying this genre - I was beyond pleasantly suprised with the game!\nIt made me reconsider my thoughts on the genre as a whole.\n\nThe word as we all know it has ended. Zombie craziness has ensued. You are Lee, you are riding in the back of a police car when the game begins. You'll find a small child and become responsible for her and here is where the similarities between your playthrough and mine will end!\n\nYour game will be shaped by the choices you make, or don't make, the things you say, or don't say and the people you save, or don't...\n\nThe game has an understandably small cast, because, you know, the world has ended.\n\nThe charcters you encounter are well written and believable. Resulting in sometimes agonising choices that need to be made. I found myself really caring about the charcters and wanting to do what's best for them all. This is a credit to the game designers who have done an outstanding job with designing them .\n\nAs Lee you will have limited time to read through the choices and shape the game you want to play. This game will demand a reply if only to find out what would have happened if you'd said something different at that critical moment!\n\nDecisions I made in the first episode are coming back to haunt me even now, in the middle of episode 4!\n\nAlthough there are no real brain crushing puzzels to be found, there are a few basic ones to be solved and that's fine.\n\nThe puzzles never get too trying or boring and are broken up very nicely by bludgeoning, slashing, stabbing and a general variety of very satisfying zombie kills\n\nA great introduction to the genre and a great game in general too!","January 4, 2013","true","16.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

(Because the final episode is so heartbreaking & you feel as if all the work you've put into the game is being let out during the last few minutes of the episode).\n\nThe Verdict:\nThis game is an emotinal rollercoaster & a DAMN fine interactive story at that, it is one which if you're a fan of the the TV Series or even the Comic Books you'll be wanting to buy, even if you're not into The Walking Dead and are just looking for a story driven game then this game is for you & i can 100% guarentee that. (I swear on my life!)\n\nThis game gets a 10 out of 10 from me.\n\nWhy does it get a 10 out of 10? Because it's so damn good, it has a strong story, each and every character you meet feels like they are a real person & you're in control of each and every friendship or enemy you make in this game, if you make someone a friend then you're going to be treated like a friend and that friend will come through thick or thin to save your ♥♥♥ if you're in need of assistance but if you make somebody an enemy then you'll feel the hate from them with every choice you make and that will make the game a lot more difficult, so choose your friends carefully.\n\nNot only these few things but each episode brings new dangers to face & more hard decisions to make which all bring you 1 step closer to the absolutely beautiful but terribly depressing finale which will have you almost in tears (if not in tears anyway).\n\nDo I Recommend This Game?:\nReally do i need to say this? YES of course i do with 1 hand on my heart and a straight back i will stand by my purchase with this & NEVER ASK FOR MY MONEY BACK!\n\nBRING ON SEASON 2 AND ALL IT'S EPISODES I NEED MORE!\n\nCheck Out My Review For Season 2:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles01/recommended/261030/","July 2, 2012","true","60.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sound and atmosphere fits very good into the story. The controls are easy. The puzzle's are not so hard but also not too easy.\n\nA game where the characters and the story is on top. The characters are well written and you will connect with them. The dialogs between them are brilliant. There are some brutal, deep & very emotional scenes.\n\nThe story is just heart touching. It changes by your choices, there are many hard ones where you need to think and you only have a certain time to choose. I don't think there is a right or wrong choice, everyone has its own and you will see the consequences later. The main story won't be affected from this choices.\n\nThe Walking Dead has one of the best storys i've ever played, better than most movies. It took me 11+ hours to finish this incredible game.\n\nEveryone who are thinking of buying it, you will not regret it.\n\nThanks to Telltale Games.\n\nRate: 10/10","April 5","true","13.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

On the first 5 minutes, I was hooked, and I said it was a 'great game.' However, after playing to the very end, I now understand the previous recommendation did not do this game the justice it deserves. It did not even come close.\n\nThis game was brilliant. I will not reveal what happens, but the game's ending is the most heart-wrenching video game moment I have ever seen. The graphics may not be that of a 2012 game, but the pure excellence of this game is worth more than all the graphics in the world. Never have I seen a game that gives you a chance to create such a strong bond with all the characters that you meet, even the ones that didn't particularly like you. Throughout the entire story, I was on the edge of my seat, even after the last credit rolled off the screen.\n\nWith astonishing writing, compelling characters, a heart-wrenching ending, and a strong emotional consistency, this game is - without a doubt - THE best game of 2012.\n\nFellow gamers, whether you like zombie games or not, hear me out: play this game.\n\nYou will not be disappointed.","December 8, 2012","true","71.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The character development and cinematic gameplay exceeds other games that have tried this style of gameplay. You grow fond of your player character of the course of the episodes and his group. The biggest development is that between Lee and Clementine, who will be the player character in Season 2. There are several ways to go about completing the story, as in whether or not certain characters survive or leave, but this doesn't affect the overall plot.\n\nOne thing that did bother me were some of the animations, they seemed clunky in some areas, maybe a little bit lazy for being a game so character centric. And even though Telltale were smart with the comic book stylization to attract fans of the original comics and not the show, they could have used higher resolution textures, as the foliage and some clothing were obviously low resolution.\n\nOverall, it's a fantastic game worthy of its acclaim.\n\n9.0/10","December 11, 2013","true","16.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Évaluer la pertinence de ses choix ? Quelquefois il faut 10 heures pour finalement être déçu, d'autre fois 30-40-50 pour se rendre compte que malgré les promesses, le jeu ne tient pas compte de nos décisions.\n\nCette longue intro pour dire que quand j'ai finalement démarré ma partie de The Walking Dead, je partais avec quelques préjugés :\n- jeu à licence, donc risque de trouver une grosse me.de baclée\n(et pourtant j'aime bien Kirkman)\n- un peu marre de la mode zombie collée partout\n(et pourtant j'aime bien le genre pré/post-apo)\n- je n'avais pas retouché un point-and-click depuis longtemps, et je n'avais pas trop le courage de me taper des heures de ratissage de pixels.\nEt pourtant j'ai essayé, et bien m'en a pris.\n\nThe Walking Dead répond exceptionnellement bien aux préoccupations dont je parlais en intro. Comme on dit quelque fois : "it delivers".\n\nConsidérez que l'attachement aux personnages, les choix cornéliens qui font les jeux mémorables, ici vous en trouverez non seulement beaucoup, mais que la satisfaction ne viendra pas en 10 heures, ho non. Elle viendra en même pas 3 heures : le temps de boucler un épisode (le jeu en compte 5).\nEn l'espace de 2-3 heures, vous aurez eu le temps de résoudre des problèmes vitaux, considérer les conséquences dramatiques de vos actions, et vous attacher diablement aux casting de cette histoire.\nUn petit miracle de narration interactive condensé sur le temps d'une soirée film.\n\nBien sur le jeu n'est pas parfait, et de manière évidente le studio ne pouvait pas proposer une arborescence de choix et dérivations du scénario énorme... MAIS à chaque fois, le jeu montre clairement comment vos actes impactent les réactions des autres personnages et la qualité de vos relations avec eux. Et cela par des dialogues assez brillants, et une exposition très cinématographique.\nBien sur que le jeu n'est pas "difficile" et que son gameplay est limité. Je mettrais cela en parallèle avec les jeux de rôle papier : on distingue quelquefois les jeux simulationnistes (accent sur le jeu) et les jeux narrativistes (accent sur l'histoire). Walking Dead est de ce dernier type.\n\nThe Walking Dead est probablement le meilleur jeu de 2012, il propose une expérience de jeu attachante et mémorable et il se permet le luxe de le faire en étant totalement accessible.\nAbsolute Must.","September 16, 2013","true","16.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

When death, conflict and despair lurk around every corner, each little victory is a ray of hope that can put a smile on your face. And sometimes, when you lose someone you've gotten attached to, you might just end up with a few tears running down your cheeks.\n\nI find it odd to say this about a zombie game, but this really is a piece of art.

This is not a bad thing - the story is very good with various possibilities and alternative story lines opening up depending on your in-game / dialogue choices. The well-written, emotional story does not protect its characters with plot armour or convenient / momentary stupidity of characters for plot progression, nor do characters suffer form "cheap deaths" purely for the purposes of controversy, short-term interest or perceived brutality, as we have come to expect from its TV show counterpart. Characters do come across as mortal and realistic, and characters you like do inevitably die, as the story progresses. With that said, the game does end essentially in the exact same way regardless of your prior choices, which was disappointing considering how much emphasis is put on player choice.\n\nThe gameplay is around 90% dialogue (interactive), and 10% combat. Although combat is not the focus of the game, it would have been nice if the combat were more fun - it does not go much further than taking pot shots at sluggish zombies, and it saves so often that there is very little sense of urgency or pressure to "get it right first time"; something that should not be happening in a game that is based in the context of a zombie apocalypse.\n\nAs I said before, "The Walking Dead" is, by all accounts best enjoyed when viewed not as a video game but rather as an interactive film, given the emphasis on atmosphere, character development and story. These are aspects that funnily enough are better-refined and more polished in this game, than that in the TV show, which at this point is more disjointed and lifeless than the zombies that that the franchise itself is based on.

TWD season 1 consists of 5 episodes, and 1 extra DLC. every episode is unique, suspenseful and are interconnected. every choice you make matters. everything has its consequences.\n\nThe strongest plus point is the story line. supported with convincing voice over and great cinematography, it is more like watching a movie, rather than playing a game, and its a great thing.\nnowdays games are so cheap and promising countless hours of "fun". it is refreshing to see a game, that really takes you, and made you care for each of the characters. from simple choices of who you choose to save, or who gets the last ration. every day is a struggle, and you FEEL the struggle.\n\nBut again, this game is not for everybody. this is for gamer that appreciate story line, that doesnt want to rush everything. The pace of the game is well balanced, it knows when to use silence and when not.\ni recommend this game being played, when you have the time to enjoy its atmosphere to its fullest extent.\neach episode last about 1.5-2 hours.\n\ni really enjoyed this game and have already bought season 2. ;)\n\nthis game personally make it to my hall of fame of storyline/emotion category, alongside mass effect 3, and red dead redemption.\n\nPS: younger gamer usually want to exploit every possible game, using walkthrough etc to gain "best" possible outcome.\ni dont recommend that playstyle. just play it without any help, and stick with the choice you made, good or bad.","January 3, 2014","true","12.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","5"

Évaluer la pertinence de ses choix ? Quelquefois il faut 10 heures pour finalement être déçu, d'autre fois 30-40-50 pour se rendre compte que malgré les promesses, le jeu ne tient pas compte de nos décisions.\n\nCette longue intro pour dire que quand j'ai finalement démarré ma partie de The Walking Dead, je partais avec quelques préjugés :\n- jeu à licence, donc risque de trouver une grosse me.de baclée\n(et pourtant j'aime bien Kirkman)\n- un peu marre de la mode zombie collée partout\n(et pourtant j'aime bien le genre pré/post-apo)\n- je n'avais pas retouché un point-and-click depuis longtemps, et je n'avais pas trop le courage de me taper des heures de ratissage de pixels.\nEt pourtant j'ai essayé, et bien m'en a pris.\n\nThe Walking Dead répond exceptionnellement bien aux préoccupations dont je parlais en intro. Comme on dit quelque fois : "it delivers".\n\nConsidérez que l'attachement aux personnages, les choix cornéliens qui font les jeux mémorables, ici vous en trouverez non seulement beaucoup, mais que la satisfaction ne viendra pas en 10 heures, ho non. Elle viendra en même pas 3 heures : le temps de boucler un épisode (le jeu en compte 5).\nEn l'espace de 2-3 heures, vous aurez eu le temps de résoudre des problèmes vitaux, considérer les conséquences dramatiques de vos actions, et vous attacher diablement aux casting de cette histoire.\nUn petit miracle de narration interactive condensé sur le temps d'une soirée film.\n\nBien sur le jeu n'est pas parfait, et de manière évidente le studio ne pouvait pas proposer une arborescence de choix et dérivations du scénario énorme... MAIS à chaque fois, le jeu montre clairement comment vos actes impactent les réactions des autres personnages et la qualité de vos relations avec eux. Et cela par des dialogues assez brillants, et une exposition très cinématographique.\nBien sur que le jeu n'est pas "difficile" et que son gameplay est limité. Je mettrais cela en parallèle avec les jeux de rôle papier : on distingue quelquefois les jeux simulationnistes (accent sur le jeu) et les jeux narrativistes (accent sur l'histoire). Walking Dead est de ce dernier type.\n\nThe Walking Dead est probablement le meilleur jeu de 2012, il propose une expérience de jeu attachante et mémorable et il se permet le luxe de le faire en étant totalement accessible.\nAbsolute Must.","September 16, 2013","true","16.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game here, is without a doubt one of my favourite (if not my all-time favourite) story driven games of all time. Having been a fan of Telltale Games for a really long time (since the Sam & Max days) it's rather incredible to see how much they've grown up. I always thought to myself that after the third season of Sam & Max they hit their highest possible note, but I was wrong. They acquired some huge licenses afterwards which included Back to the Future, Jurassic Park, Fables and The Walking Dead.\n\nI don't read the comics or watch the show at all. Despite that, I gave the game a chance thanks to how much respect I had for Telltale as well as from the critical acclaim it had been recieving. And wow, I was blown away.\n\nThe part of The Walking Dead Game that most people talk about is the characterisation of Lee Everett (the game's protagonist) and Clementine (a young girl you protect throughout the season who also serves as the moral compass) and with good reason, both of them are excellent characters. I couldn't even believe they were as likeable as they were going to be. The best part is while Lee is a blank slate for you to create the personality of, you'll always end up liking him. Because you are Lee. And you're doing what you think is right or wrong in a zombie apocalypse while also trying best to protect Clementine from the harsh world. Even if you play as Lee as a human saviour who stands for everything good left in humanity he will always be the flawed man he was before you took control of him, and that's why he is one of my favourite game characters of all time, period.\n\nAnd the way the game tackles the nature of seeing what a little girl is going through growing up in an apocalypse is incredible. Clementine is one of the few children characters I've ever seen in a video game that I genuinely cared about and wanted to keep safe. Her adorable nature, innocence and hope that things will be okay is one of the things that keeps this game from being completely bleak and depressing. She is your light in the really messed up world.\n\nCharacterisation is without a doubt the most powerful thing of this game. While Lee and Clem are the most important characters in the game you will meet several, several faces that you will like/dislike. Which also, Telltale done a phenomenal job writing. There's some characters people will love, people will hate and some we will all hate (I think anyone who finished the game knows who I mean).\n\nSo in short, the game was one of the most incredible experiences I ever had. I loved every minute of it and while I had some save file issues recently (thanks to 400 Days) there's no doubt that this game is best on PC. It suffers pretty much 0 freezes and never lags when it's autosaving. Which were issues the console versions unfortunately suffered quite significantly.\n\nPlus if you can, get 400 Days. It was a neat side-story and I have a good thought in my head that it will have an impact on Season Two in the months to come. Which FYI, started very strongly indeed.\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, it's not an action game, it's an adventure game-choose your own adventure hybrid. And I love it for that.\n\nBuy this game, even if you think you have had a fatigue with zombies (which are not even the main concept of this game) it's already won quite a few awards, so I don't think I need to say much else other than this was the best game of 2012. Which I, 100% agree with.","January 3, 2014","true","108.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Games like this one, Jurassic Park & The Wolf Among Us, with huge storylines and limited interaction possibilities would be better enjoyed with the picture as great as you can make it! Yes I have imported my decisions into season 2 (mass effect), I played the DLC, & am excited to hear of further upcoming seasons. The main protagonist, an african-american man, is a romantic, and easy to like, although he won't (can't) continue beyond this season. I am still getting used to the idea of playing a little girl (Clementine) in season 2. As a story, and played through the projector on my wall, I liked this game, HINTING that without doing that my enjoyment as much as I did now may have been reduced by HALF!

Given their previous games and despite the subject matter, I was not expecting such a dark game but they pulled it off very well.  I can't think of any other game I have played that gives the player such difficult decisions to make and they do have a significant impact on the story later on.  The storytelling and voice acting is fantastic, as I would expect.\n\nGraphically, the game really isn't great.  It is styled to look like the comics, but many of the textures are absurdly low resolution for a modern game which hurts the visible detail.  It's passable though and not really the focus of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit of a mixed bag for me.  While I do like the innovative way they deal with many "struggle" events with a cursor that appears in a random place, the "mash button to do something" sections have been done to death in this and other games, and was never immersive, interesting, or good for your keyboard/gamepad.  I really hope season 2 isn't full of that as well.\n\nI am definitely looking forward to playing other Telltale games and I have a few on my list, if mostly for the storytelling.  Now back to dealing with zombies in season 2.","January 13, 2015","true","13.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"

No, this story? I just hope for one thing, and that is that no one has to ever experience the kind of emotional suffering involved for people in real life with real life decisions like choosing between lives to save or between your own welfare and your children's. No human should have to be forced to make those kinds of decisions. But that is exactly what this game forces you to do. Sure, you can stay silent during conversations, but you'll lose all respect.\n\nI played all five episodes, one each day, and I've just finished the last one. And I feel like I really don't want to play another Season. This game is not hard, it's brutal. I think about things like the apocalypse a lot, like what a world full of the living dead will be like, or a world where only you are alive. This game had me questioning, as I still do, the worth and value of human existence in times of prolonged suffering. Is there hope? Real hope? Or is that simply a mental mechanism to keep going and find a reason, however illogical, to keep living. What is the purpose of life, what are we living for? To raise up children, to just enjoy ourselves, to keep moving towards the inevitability of death? However unreal and farcical you may think a zombie apocalypse is, it acts as a compelling context for life questions.\n\nAnd not just that. It serves to seek out how we might react in a certain situation. Everyone has different personalities, and I'm sure you'd agree with me when I suggest that in this modern society, it's difficult to really know someone within a few days of meeting them. But when the world goes to absolute sh*t, there is no need for false impressions anymore. You can see people pretty square on. I had my brain in agony deciding, at times, what to say. I found myself trying to protect Clementine as much as I could. I realised her deepest desire was to see her parents, and I kept that in mind. I tried to save whoever I could. I saw people as humans, I saw them beneath their often capricious personalities (Kenny, Larry, Lilly - heh, even me sometimes). I tried to keep a level head all the time, and I guess that goes with my own underlying scepticism of life, held together by vocally agreeing with people who are good by their actions. I defined good as judging people not by what I or even our group needs, but by what the person being judged actually says they need. I could cite several situations, but I note this is a review, for those yet to buy the game.\n\nI'm glad, now looking at the game as a whole, that TellTale didn't do a 'Last of Us'. Not only is this game true to the comic book foundations of TWD, but it meant that more resources can go into making a fantastic decision-based story that feels so real and just draws you into it. Yes, you are not Lee Everett, you don't have his history, his family, or even his words (talking about the choices of dialogue you get), but it's close enough to identifying what kind of a person YOU are, because each dialogue option takes a certain philosophy and moral direction. Mostly, I was consistent, but sometimes, such as with Larry, I blew. I could talk a lot about what this game teaches you, or has taught me, but I must restrain myself, knowing not to let a review become an essay in philosophical thought.\n\nI haven't played anything like this before. It's different, and it's intelligent, and it will make you, yes, force you, to really think about what you say and do.","September 20, 2015","true","14.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I will be separating my review, focusing first on the game itself, and then the DLC.\n\nMY THOUGHTS ON THE GAME\nI was introduced to Telltale by a friend on mine, who loved zombies and had also played Law & Order: Legacies. We both thought the games looked cool and the idea of being responsible for your own choices sounded amazing.\nThe Walking Dead was a game I also wanted to play because of the TV show and let me tell you right here that there are no connections between the two. Sure, the creators thought it would be cool to add Glenn in the first episode, but excluding the zombie plot, the show and this game are two different things (and that is actually a pro).\n\nThe Walking dead has a specific look that in a sense reminds me of comics, however they are still appealing. And when it comes to gore, the comic-looking design still works, which is an amazing plus. Although it doesn't have, in my opinion, the best design/graphics I've ever seen, it's still quite atractive to look at.\n\nIn terms of how the game works itself, as you can easily see in any review of this game, if you're hoping for a game where you can get some guns and blow some heads while you walk around Georgia, then you are wrong. Although there are some fighting scenes and the interaction exists in the entire game (you move characters, make them click stuff, etc.), this is a story-driven game, where the plot moves according to your choices. More than playing a game, you're watching a story. And for those who watch the show and like it's heavy/depressed tone, this game has it too.\n\nBut how are the choices? Do you REALLY choose? Well, I haven't played many other games where your choices define the story so I dare say you do REALLY choose. But I must also advise you this is a game and being such, it has limitations. Meaning sometimes you might choose the words or other paths but some destinations are the same. This isn't necessarily bad, it still influences on the relations between characters and it still changes situations, so I wouldn't get too worked up about it. Even if it's not perfect, it's still a good game.\n\nPROS\n- nice and easy interface. If you've used a computer before, you can play this.\n- interesting design/graphics\n- strong plot that will very likely make you look for your tissues\n- the story is REALLY interesting - I almost felt like I was watching a tv show while still making decisions about it.\n\nCONS\n- some episodes are more stronger than others (altough this is highly subjective)\n- although you make choices, sometimes you will still be led to the same path\n\nMY THOUGHTS ABOUT THE DLC\nWhen the DLC was announced my first thought was: "oh my god, I have to play it because otherwise I won't understand a thing about season two!". Then a friend of mine actually told me the DLC was totally irrelevant to the story and I wasn't sure what to do. Eventually, I bought the DLC and decided to play it after finishing season 1. The review for The Walking Dead applies here in almost everything, so I will resume this:\n\nPROS\n- same graphics/design\n- same decision making\n- introduces small stories about new characters that are in some ways connected\n- some references to season 1\n\nCONS\n- the references to season 1 are funny but that's about it. You hear about the fate of one or two characters, you recognise some places or faces, but that's about it.\n- introduces a few characters from season 2, giving you an idea of what happened to them before the season itself, but if you don't play it... they will explain it on season 2\n- although fun, makes no difference whatsoever, meaning you can just ignore it and start season 2.\n\nOverall, both the game and DLC are a nice addition to your games library and I would recommend it to anyone interested in a good plot while still interacting. And if you are new to games, don't worry - this is a very "noob" friendly game. There is no need for you to be an amazing player to succeed at this. Just play the game, enjoy the story and choose some paths - I assure you: it will be a bumpy, yet awesome, ride.","June 14, 2015","true","15.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However it follows the timelines of a different bunch of people instead of focusing on Rick Grimes which is the main character in both comic and TV series.\n\nThe main inspiration for this franchise is Robert Kirkman and as stated from his first 'walking dead' comic onwards, the main focus of this zombie apocalypse story was to explore how 'messed up we all are' and that basically everyone when exposed to extreme situations, everyone eventually changes into a blurry monster bent on survival. Those that don't change/adapt according to Robert Kirkman's universe do not survive. Any sense of needing to be 'civilised' is an inconvenient illusion in this world, which since it is also no longer hindered by fear of potential punishment from God or government, mankind in general will shrink back to its primal instinct.\n\nThis moral dilemma of what the world was and what the world now is; is what the franchise plays on. In both Comic and TV series it does this by following the time line Of Rick Grimes a police officer, with an inbuilt sense of right and wrong because of his occupation. Eventually as time goes on Rick loses all this morality and justifies perverse actions as a necessity for survival or justice. In this game however it does the same thing in a slightly different fashion. It follows the time line of Lee a convicted murderer who is trying his hardest to protect the innocence of Clementine an orphaned child, while at the same time give her the necessities to survive by herself if needs be without it corrupting her innocence.\n\nThe inspiration behind this notion that 'we are all monsters' comes from the various bloody genocides that have often plagued our history such as Rwanda, Hutu and Tutsi, World War 1 and 2 etc. The game therefore goes out of its way to expose this potential monster not just in the general characters of the game, but also in you the gamer too. It does this in a number of ways. First it gives you various moral dilemma’s such as to choose between saving one person or the other, or to maim a person forever in order to keep them alive in general, or to let someone suicide or not. While the game gives you the illusion that your choice matters, it doesn't. Whatever choice you make there will be faulty reasoning attached, and the cost of that decision will always be high against someone else. The game therefore will tell you off for whatever choice you make exposing that you may not be innocent or guilt-free. Secondly regardless of how you much you try and protect the innocence of Clementine, Clementine will be forced to make a decision in the end which will change her innocence forever and lastly a decision which may have seemed trivial in the middle of the game ends up being the most crucial decision in the end and it will come back and haunt you to show how many people have died or suffered because of your ignorance. Thankfully this message is delivered in a fashion which is palatable largely because the character that is condemning and exposing your inconsistencies is someone a few sandwiches short of a picnic themselves...\n\nSince the game is largely focused on the human psyche more so, than it is on its story elements as a zombie apocalypse, the game will never go on to explain the outbreak? It will never explain why the virus only affects humans and not animals? It will not explain where it originated or if there is a cure? The only thing that the game explains is that all humans have it and it is only activated when a person is bit or when they die naturally. Therefore the title 'The Walking Dead' is not referring to the zombies; it's actually referring to the survivors. Since they all have the virus they are the 'Walking Dead' prolonging the inevitable.\n\nPersonally I do not agree with Robert Kirkman's notion that we are all potentially monsters and those that aren't would be somewhat disadvantaged against those that are. The notion 'survival of the fittest' also applies to things like stealth and charisma and even in the most bloodiest times of human history, the importance to survive with one's morals intact is just as important to some people as survival itself. This has boosted some people's ability to survive such moments in history relatively unscathed of bloodguilt or wrongdoing. Also Kirkman fails to note the length that some guilty parties have gone too to protect those that are still innocent. In all times of human's bloodiest history the miracle of innocence has always survived somewhere.\n\nThis game also highlights one of the biggest faults behind Kirkman's notion of an ongoing zombie apocalypse. In one of the episodes the survivors come across a zombie so weak that it cannot even support its own body weight to move. Since the Zombies would require a constant source of fresh meat, within a week the zombie population would be starved and unable to support itself. Hence even in Kirkman's world, stealth would be way more practical than tyrannical thinking.\n\nThe game since it is adult in nature has many scenes which are not suitable for children. There is one situation where you’re required to cave in a zombie skull with a hammer or another scene where you are required to cut off someone's leg from a bear trap. There is also a large amount of course language in the game too.\n\nThe storyboard is probably one of the game's best attributes and the cartoon is quite stylish in its rendering. There are constantly things to do in the game which break up the monotony of the reading novel aspects, though it is constantly accompanied by top notch voice acting and a well envisioned musical score.\n\nIn final, it is a game where you cannot escape making perverse actions, but you can choose how your character feels about those actions. A game recommended for those that do not mind adult content. Not recommended for those that do.","September 11, 2015","true","18.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Secondly regardless of how you much you try and protect the innocence of Clementine, Clementine will be forced to make a decision in the end which will change her innocence forever and lastly a decision which may have seemed trivial in the middle of the game ends up being the most crucial decision in the end and it will come back and haunt you to show how many people have died or suffered because of your ignorance. Thankfully this message is delivered in a fashion which is palatable largely because the character that is condemning and exposing your inconsistencies is someone a few sandwiches short of a picnic themselves...\n\nSince the game is largely focused on the human psyche more so, than it is on its story elements as a zombie apocalypse, the game will never go on to explain the outbreak? It will never explain why the virus only affects humans and not animals? It will not explain where it originated or if there is a cure? The only thing that the game explains is that all humans have it and it is only activated when a person is bit or when they die naturally. Therefore the title 'The Walking Dead' is not referring to the zombies; it's actually referring to the survivors. Since they all have the virus they are the 'Walking Dead' prolonging the inevitable.\n\nPersonally I do not agree with Robert Kirkman's notion that we are all potentially monsters and those that aren't would be somewhat disadvantaged against those that are. The notion 'survival of the fittest' also applies to things like stealth and charisma and even in the most bloodiest times of human history, the importance to survive with one's morals intact is just as important to some people as survival itself. This has boosted some people's ability to survive such moments in history relatively unscathed of bloodguilt or wrongdoing. Also Kirkman fails to note the length that some guilty parties have gone too to protect those that are still innocent. In all times of human's bloodiest history the miracle of innocence has always survived somewhere.\n\nThis game also highlights one of the biggest faults behind Kirkman's notion of an ongoing zombie apocalypse. In one of the episodes the survivors come across a zombie so weak that it cannot even support its own body weight to move. Since the Zombies would require a constant source of fresh meat, within a week the zombie population would be starved and unable to support itself. Hence even in Kirkman's world, stealth would be way more practical than tyrannical thinking.\n\nThe game since it is adult in nature has many scenes which are not suitable for children. There is one situation where you’re required to cave in a zombie skull with a hammer or another scene where you are required to cut off someone's leg from a bear trap. There is also a large amount of course language in the game too.\n\nThe storyboard is probably one of the game's best attributes and the cartoon is quite stylish in its rendering. There are constantly things to do in the game which break up the monotony of the reading novel aspects, though it is constantly accompanied by top notch voice acting and a well envisioned musical score.\n\nIn final, it is a game where you cannot escape making perverse actions, but you can choose how your character feels about those actions. A game recommended for those that do not mind adult content. Not recommended for those that do.","September 11, 2015","true","18.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

If you came here because you either read the comics or watch the AMC Walking Dead on TV, it is just as good! The story is incredible, providing some funny, scary and sad moments that will just tie you to the rest of the game. Be prepared for this emotional story though, just like the comics and tv series universe, it's quite good at making you cry, but it's totally worth it.","September 20, 2015","true","14.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's emotional, epic, involving, fun and so in-depth with regards to the characters and the revolutionised choice-based plot.\n\nThe way Lee comes across entirely depends on you, as does the relationship with the people you are stuck with/chose to survive along with you. Very clever and heart-wrenching. The final scenes had me welling up and the last time I did that over a game was, like, 8 years ago.\n\nI'd recommend this to anyone and everyone. If you want a standard 'run around and shoot zombies using two brain-cells' game then don't expect that here, but do expect something different and a million times better. It just should be exerienced.","April 4, 2015","true","23.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The Walking dead is the epitome of games; everything about this game is perfect, be it the story or gameplay - it's perfect.\n\nEven moreso is the fact that you actually care what Clementine, a person who doesn't even exist, thinks about you is just plain amazing. I never once thought about whether or not I was hurting somebody close to me in a video game yet Clementine somehow made me care.\n\n10/10 - I only hope this is enough to make Clementine happy!","February 1, 2014","true","14.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
