"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/392970/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1791 products in account","Laura is back! After solving the mafia case, she's sent to investigate a series of strange murders. She discovers that it's a paranormal being that is behind these. Why? How can she stop that?\n\nThis time, the story is revolving around a man whose execution has gone so bad that the authorities never spoke about it. That's how the game is beginning. So you have to find how he disappeared and how come it's related to the murders. As usual, the game is mixing reality and paranormal and underground train as it's how you reach each location, like in the first game. You're working for Bishop, who was the one that asked for your help previously. The bonus chapter is about the father of the convict and how he tried to save his son to a death sentence.\n\nAnyway, the gameplay is items to find, to combine, shapes scenes (let's say that maximum 5 of them may be harder to solve), puzzles (with some that are rare in the genre or combining several in one) and people to meet and discuss. It's not that I like the shape scene, however, I would have preferred some variety, like alternating with a list of hidden objects.\n\nThe developers are also the same as Lost Lands, so, yeah, given the fact that I've played three of their games nearly in a row, the first NY mysteries being weeks ago, I can't forget about the bonus contained in the opus: minigames to replay (new or familiar ones - practical to get timed or click counted achievements involving some of them), concept arts, music tracks, etc.. Besides, you have also objects to collect to unlock stuff: beyond objects (changing appearance) and four specific objects (Liberty Statue, cats, towers or balls) that are all in each scene. Besides, collecting diapositives is also explaining the background of the Order you're working for - though I have to confirm that because I didn't look about them.\n\nAnyway, the graphics are quite good and diversified: from a prison to a lab that would have pleased Tesla (as the game is also based on what he discovered) without forgetting New York under the snow in the bonus chapter. And that soundtrack! I mean, it was giving me chills.\n\nSo, yeah, I can say that it's among these HO games that you need to play, as it's not boring and very well done. Perhaps the voice acting of Laura could be better..... but hey, I didn't regret my purchase. Go for it, seriously!","January 19","true","8.1"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

Great graphics, good story and good length. There is also Steam achievements which is nice too and not a bad price for a collector's edition compared to some of the others with outrageous prices.","January 12","true","6.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

I appreciate the length in gameplay and how nicely the chapter wrapped up. (In the last bonus chapter, there were a few plot holes. So this was a nice change!)\n\nWhile I enjoyed this game, I sensed a change in theme...\n\nSecrets Of The Mafia had a creepier vibe to it, and it also borrowed quite a number of noir themes to add to the mystery (Wandering the city at night, unsure of who to trust, conspiracy plots, etc.).\n\nThis game takes place almost entirely during the daytime (which was refreshing, don't get me wrong), and it was devoid of the noir feel. However, to make up for that, the new lore borrows a lot from Nicola Tesla's work and the mystery surrounding physics. So, instead of a noir crime mystery, you'll get to experience more of a sci-fi mystery.\n\n~ . ~ .\n\n+ Pros +\n\n*6+ hours of gameplay\n\n*Same lush, curious art style\n\n*NEW areas of New York to explore\n\n*MORE characters to interact with\n\n*Additional game lore and character origins\n\n\n\n- Cons -\n\n*Still only have one save file\n(You can create multiple profiles and start the game over that way, but if you play bits of the bonus chapter AND want to replay some of the main game, your save file will be overwritten. I kind of wish there was a chapter select and multiple save slots.)\n\n*Voice acting\n(Laura's voice was a bit unpolished, but it wasn't too unpleasant; just needs practice!)\n\n*Abrupt ending\n(The ending for the main game was pretty good, but it was a bit rushed, in my opinion. Also, I wish that there had been a bit of a 'wind down'; a time for Laura and Dr. Bishop to reflect on the case.)\n\n~ . ~ .\n\nOverall, the game was a very relaxing and enjoyable experience.\nIt's a little pale compared to the previous game, but just as quirky as ever.\n\nI've come to adore the franchise and I'm very hopeful for a sequel!","February 18","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The storyline held various twists and turns that made it intriguing and the graphics are beautifully done. Instead of growing bored or irritated at the gameplay I found myself wanting more and eagerly played through the bonus chapter.\n\nEven if you are one who isn't a fan of Hidden Object games, this game is bound to surprise and delight you. It's masterfully done and I don't regret buying it for a second.","February 28","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

New York Mysteries; High Voltage is a suspenseful hidden item game set in 1950′s New York City. It has a strong plot, great aesthetics and is full of tons of fun. Can you help Laura solve the mystery before it’s too late?\n\nPeople are dropping like flies and the police don’t have much evidence to go on, however witnesses claim to see a ball of light at the scenes of the crimes. The White Stone Order, a secret underground organization specializing in the paranormal, attempts to  solve the mystery from the shadows and invite Laura to help with her keen mind and investigative journalism skills. The story leads Laura on an adventure to stop a serial killer from exacting his revenge on those that tried to execute him. Travel with Laura around New York City as you search for clues and find a way to bring this murderer down once and for all.\n\nWhile the story itself is filled with thrills and sharp plot turns, the game also has lovely visuals to help keep you enthralled. All of the backgrounds are rich with color, the hidden object scenes are beautiful done and easy to see while still offering a challenge and the characters are very lively. The game also has well-animated cut scenes and excellent voice acting. The game also has a beautiful score to listen to as you play.\n\nGreat scenes and puzzles offer a challenge which makes gaining all the achievements that much more rewarding. There is also a bonus chapter that gives even more depth to the drama. The bonus content gives you access to wallpapers, videos from the game, concept art, re-playable mini games, puzzles and a brand new mini game! There a lot of in game items to collect as well during a play through.\n\nNew York Mysteries: High Voltage is a solid game that offers hours of enjoyment. The only issue I had while playing it was a saving glitch which forced me to replay the ending again, however, the issue seems to have been fixed with a recent patch at the time of this review. The developers were quick to fix the issue which shows, along with such an overall superb game, that they’re dedicated to their fans. I highly recommend grabbing this title, you won’t regret it.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","February 22","true","8.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"
