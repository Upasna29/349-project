But when you arrive at this house, it seems that he crossed it and is in danger, like in your dream! Travelling from world to world, the mysterious guardian is putting obstacles so that you can't complete the artifact in your possession... but why?\n\nMythic Wonders is again a game picked by Artifex Mundi to be part of their publishing catalogue. While I do think that they should develop more their series as they're really good, they're good to choose their games, apart with one or two of them (but one of them was plagued with translation problems  - I should see if they're now patched). Mythic Wonders is the last at the time of the writing.\n\nThe story is very good as you're jumping from world to world, corresponding to a new power you'll acquire for the artifact. And these are needed if you want to advance: lightning to see darker areas, fire to burn obstacles, water for growing plants, etc.. I didn't really expect the twist at the end, even with the hind dropped.\n\nThe gameplay is quite standard: use items, find them, clear hidden objects scenes, solve puzzles. The fact that you need to use logic to open the portals are also a nice idea, though I think there was a mistranlation at one moment. Besides, hidden objects scenes are also varied: list of items and shaped. But what I really liked a certain shaped type: runes. It was fun to find symbols in a scene full of them. Puzzles were easy to solve apart for one or two where I had to check a walkthrough because even with the help, I couldn't really understand it.\n\nThe graphics are quite beautiful, given the different worlds visited. They're always bright and peaceful, even when you're surrounded by lava. It's one of the best I've seen in the Artifex Mundi world. And the soundtrack was also quite good.\n\nIt's also a collector's edition, meaning an extra chapter in the shoes of an ancestor at the time of the creation of the guardian, concept arts, etc..\n\nMythic Wonders: The Philosopher's Stone is really one of the gems in Artifex Mundi's catalogue. A very good story, nice landscapes, good gameplay, why ask for more? This is a must-have for hidden objects and casual lovers.","April 25","true","4.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/recommended/458480/","drpixel","DrPixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/","3726 products in account","Product received for free\n\nEarth. Wind. Fire. Water. These are the ingredients that make up.....the Powerpuff Girls! Alright, that was a dumb reference! Anyway, these are the basic elements of course! Video games include them sporadically all the time, but what about a game that includes all of them? Well, let's see how it is!\n\nThe BreakdownMythic Wonders: The Philosopher's Stone is a hidden object game (HOG, for short). If you're not familiar with HOGs, essentially they're a clickfest with a story and puzzles attached. The basic gameplay consists of you clicking on objects to either collect or interact with them to progress the story. This time around, the plot is about a woman, Emma, whose uncle, Alfred, has dedicated his life to pursuing the mythical philosopher's stone. Y'know, the one that is supposed to turn basic metals into gold? Now, the game never really explains much about the stone, but I feel like that's because Artifex Mundi HOGs tend to be a bit weak in the story department.\n\nSee, this game is published by Artifex Mundi, and at least from my experience, it seems like the basic story of each of their hidden object titles is mostly the same. You play as female X and need to rescue/find family member Y, who is probably interested in or searching for object/location/thing Z. Now, there's nothing wrong with this basic concept, don't get me wrong - in fact, I think it's important that more video games include female protagonists. Yet, this all just makes it feel like the game is treading familiar ground in the HOG department - if you've played one, the story won't really feel unique at all. Actually funnily enough, two Artifex Mundi HOGs I played recently were surprisingly similar in some ways to this one: Time Mysteries involves moving through various themed areas (time periods in that game and elemental-themed areas in this one), while Tibetan Quest's "final boss" used the same memory-based gameplay as in this game to defeat it.\n\nDespite the "hey, I've seen this all done before!" feeling of the game's plot, I must compliment the game in terms of its gameplay. I've played a decent amount of hidden object games by now, but I was really surprised at the diversity of puzzles and hidden object scene types here. Usually, the types of puzzles are recycled from game to game, but there was a fair amount of new ones (to me at least) in this game. In addition to that, the hidden object scenes themselves were not only beautifully detailed but also had multiple types which surprised me a bit. Some involved the usual word lists (a bit like those "I Spy" books), but quite a few were different. Lists of pictures or symbols were sometimes used, which in my opinion made the scenes harder yet also helped diversify the gameplay, which was nice.\n\nGraphically the game looks pretty beautiful, like I said earlier. The landscapes are fantastic and the hidden object scenes look great. The characters look a little strange, but I think it's hard to get a good balance between realistic-looking and cartoony, so I think the developers struck a decent balance at least. In terms of sound, the game is standard fare for a HOG: simple yet calming music and a general lack of sound effects besides affirmatives (like a little "whoosh" if you pick up an item or whatnot). The voice acting is nothing noteworthy in my opinion. Or at least, the protagonist just sounds pretty neutral about everything. It seems like she lacks emotion most of the time, even though [slight spoilers--->]it turns out we learn that her uncle isn't exactly good. Oh, and the uncle's voice actor is a little better, but still not great.\n\nThe game is a "collector's edition", like most if not all of Artifex Mundi's Steam releases. This means that the game contains a bonus chapter that's about 1-2 hours long on top of the main game, which takes around 3-5 hours to beat. The length of the game is pretty average compared to others in its genre, but I think that it's just about the perfect length. Any longer and I'd personally get bored from the repetitive nature of the gameplay, and any shorter and I'd feel like my money wouldn't be well spent.\n\nOverall though, I enjoyed my time with Mythic Wonders. It has some problems, mainly in the "samey" feeling of the plot and the lackluster voice acting, but the pleasant music, lovely visuals, and interesting mechanics of the puzzles help propel it to a solid recommendation from me.\n\nProsBeautiful landscapes and hidden object scenes\nDecent variety in terms of gameplay: multiple creative puzzles to solve, different types of hidden object scenes to search through, and numerous item or element-based obstacles to overcome\nMusic is calming and fits the mood of each element-themed area\nThe game takes 3-5 hours to beat, but also includes a bonus chapter that's around 1-2 hours long\nSteam achievements, trading cards, and cloud support for saves\nConsStory feels incredibly similar to many other hidden object games\nVoice acting lacks emotion\nGameplay-wise, Mythic Wonders: The Philosopher's Stone is superb. The puzzles are varied and fairly unique, and the hidden object scenes themselves were diverse in their types of lists of objects to find. It also certainly helps that the game looks quite nice. Despite the lackluster story and uninspired voice acting, this is a great hidden object game that any fan of the genre certainly should check it out.\n\nFinal Verdict: 7/10","May 26","true","4.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","7"

Step into the shoes of Emma as she tries to find her uncle but unwittingly gets dragged into a magical adventure. This game is beautifully done with a lot of unique puzzles and hidden object scenes to keep you busy. Are you ready to find the Philosopher’s Stone?\n\nEmma and her uncle have been working on a magical portal but one night she is awoken by a nightmare and fears her uncle is in danger. What she finds when she arrives is an empty house- and that he has gotten the portal to work. She steps through the looking glass and enters new and wondrous lands on her search to find him. Throughout your journey you will find clues about your uncle as well as get ominous warnings from the enigmatic Guardian. With the Philosopher’s Stone in hand, you bend nature to your will and solve the mysteries surrounding your uncle’s disappearance.\n\nThis title is a point and click game, you use your mouse to walk, select objects, talk to people and interact with the scenes. As you travel through the game you will have to get through many puzzles, most range from easy to moderate in terms of difficulty. There are also hidden object scenes as well.  They are the traditional type: A list of items that you have to find as well ones where you see the shape of the object you’re looking for and have to find it in the scene. I found the variety very pleasant and felt that it kept things fresh. There are also “morphing objects” to find as you travel along, as their name suggests they morph from one shape to another and can be hard to spot at times.\n\nVisually the game is gorgeous, lovely backgrounds, well done hidden object scenes though some require a bit of squinting. The user interface is also well done, matching the aesthetics of the game. The animation of the characters in the game is decent but it could be better, movements are stiff and mouth movements are underwhelming. The game also uses music that fits each scene, helping to create a very mystical vibe or adding to the drama where it’s needed.\n\nI was very pleased with Mythic Wonders The Philosopher's Stone, despite any flaws I may have found it’s overall a lovely game. Since this is the collector’s addition you also have an added bonus chapter as well, extending your game play. Replayable hidden object scenes and mini games are also apart of the bonus content, as well as concept art, wallpapers and music. There are also Steam achievements and trading cards to enjoy making this a well-rounded game to add to your library.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproduction.com]","May 10","true","6.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Along the way, she finds a bronze phoenix statue - the game's incarnation of the philosopher's stone - which she uses to gather the misplaced elements (fire, water, earth, air, etc.) and she uses it to get past obstacles and fight magical forces - including, but not limited to, a dragon, a mysterious phantom, and wild fauna!\n\nThe game had a nice pace to it, but because there was so much material and lore to cover, there just wasn't enough time to wrap everything up nicely at the end.\n\nMy one big gripe about the game was its own gimmick and how limited it was.\n\nThe philosopher's stone - a bronze statue of a phoenix infused with alchemic elements - had a lot of potential; I was disappointed that I primarily used the earth and water elements for puzzles and getting past obstacles in the game.\nThe air and aether elements were only used a few times near the very end of the game - if the game had two more levels to it, all the elements would've had a chance to be used more than once.\n\nIt was a fun niche, and I found myself wishing that I had been able to use it more, so it's really unfortunate.\n\nThe only other problem I have with Mythic Wonders is how rushed the ending was for the main and bonus storyline.\n\nIt's a bit disappointing for the big twist to happen right at the end, just when you've finished gathering all the elements to complete the sorcerer's stone, have a boss battle, and then go right home and act like none of it was that big of a deal.\nThis formula was used in both plots and it just felt choppy.\n\nAll the lore and glamour aside, this was an enjoyable experience and I'm happy to add the game to my collection.\n\nThere is some replay value in regards to the relaxing puzzles and cozy backgrounds and atmosphere, so I don't regret buying this at all. I only wish that there was more meat to it.\n","May 29","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One night she had a nightmare, your uncle is at peril. Or it was a vision? So she runs to his house and noticed he activated that portal... What Emma knows about that portal? As a clue, Emma has the documents of an ancient artifact, an ominous object.\n\nJust find the key and go for it! Maybe is the only chance to save Alfred.\n\nThis is a story I liked so much, there are travels through different worlds and you have to find the clues. Someone there tries to stop you, but you have to be smart and continue your pursuit. Remember, Alfred is in danger and you are the only one who knows how to find it. Every world has a unique concept, I'm sure you'll like it as I did.\n\nGameplay\n\nLike all Artifex Mundi games, you have to pursue clues, find hidden objects, solve puzzles. I enjoyed them a lot as always. Some of the hidden objects are runes, I took some time to find them and the "skip" button called to me several times. Of course, here you have the chance of select the gaming difficulty wich is great.\n\nSomething I always like about these games is the and the art concept and the soundtrack. The art never fails, astonishing landscapes and a great soundtrack who creates an immersive adventure.\n\n\nExtras\n\nThe portal reminded me the Stargate film, in fact I think is some sort of tribute, the portal's aspect is quite similar and you have a key made of symbols like the Stargate. Once you open it you can travel through strange worlds here, worlds of elements that will help you to give power to the Philosopher Stone, and help uncle Alfred and go back home safe. Or at least that's what we expect!\n\nI have to say I like the idea of the Philosopher Stone, quite different from the famous myth but I know you gonna like the concept.\n\nOnce you finish the game don't forget to play the extra chapter. You will  find it quite interesting. I promise.\n\nThanks for publishing this game, Artifex Mundi!","May 21","true","5.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
