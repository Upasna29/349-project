I've been killed by an exploding frog, I've been crushed by my own inventory, I've turned into a pile of chaos goo. I've had my real-life sleep disturbed by nightmares of bright green Hs and dark grey Ls. Eventually I managed a win, then another. I still die a lot.\n\nThere's no other game I could imagine playing for two decades. Adom is deep, challenging, frustrating and addictive.

There's a reason why ADOM and ToME4 usually fight it out for #1 and #2 on the Roguelike of the Year awards and that's because they are both bloody good and worth your cash.\n\nADOM is one of the most challenging games I have encountered. The mechanics are deep and rewarding for those that play and discover. Death, like in any real roguelike, is common even for the experienced player and there's a major sense of satisfaction when you discover a new trick, enter a new dungeon or simply cave in the head of some nasty monster that has taken you all of your ammo, your power points and left you barely functional.\n\nI started my journey back in 1995 on the Amiga playing this game made up of @ signs and & signs and wondering how such a bland, simple looking game could ever hope to hold my attention. 20 years on, new content has been added and colourful tiles presenting a much nicer GUI have arrived.\n\nAnd one piece of advice.... never EVER eat a kobold... it's like Montezuma's revenge (wait, you might meet him) only worse!!!","November 16, 2015","true","71.4"," 80 of 82 people (98%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","98","80","82","7","0"

Warning! This review mentions several things that may or may not be spoilers. The game is randomized to a degree and also depends greatly on your own choices in-game. There is no right or wrong way to play, but I do mention several things that I consider to be entertaining examples of ADOM's charm. Everything below is optional and nothing below is related to the "main plot" but if the threat of spoilers gives you heart palpitations, just know that I heartily endorse ADOM (whether in ASCII or in the new graphical mode). It's one of my top 10 games of all-time, and I gladly supported it during its indiegogo campaign despite there still being a completely free version available from the developer. It's just that good.\n\n1.) This game has entertained me for well over a decade, and I'm still not tired of it.\n\n2.)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moozooh/recommended/333300/","moozooh","moozooh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moozooh/","103 products in account","Ancient Domains of Mystery... what a name. Truth be told, of all games I have played on my PC in the last 15 years, ADOM has surely been the one I keep returning to most often. And if there's anything that hasn't changed since the first time is that, whenever I do start up a new character, I can hardly keep myself off the game until the character dies... or until I win. Today the game is officially released on Steam, and the least I can do to repay ADOM and its team for hundreds upon hundreds of hours of fun is to review it.\n\nSo, what is ADOM about? It's a fantasy-themed roguelike RPG where you create a character of your liking, choosing from a roster of several races and professions, and embark upon a journey to find out what is it that's plaguing a remote mountain chain. Most of the elements are pretty easy to grasp now that we have mouse control, graphics, and even some rudimentary animation, but should you spend some more time with the game, you'll certainly realize the complexity and level of detail that manifest themselves in almost every aspect of the game (well, except the dialogues—this isn't Planescape: Torment for sure) and this tends to hook everyone who spends more than a couple hours with it. It's not often that you play something for years and keep learning something new and relearning old things with every playthrough. Most of the in-game situations have lots of different possible solutions, which is something that large expensive AAA-titles have all but forgone these days. This game certainly rewards intelligent, thoughtful play—which in no way dimishes its ability to pump adrenaline in certain situations.\n\nAs far as roguelikes go, ADOM is definitely more on the traditional RPG side: the world isn't as sandbox-ish as something like Dwarf Fortress, there are a lot of fixed elements and reasonably fleshed-out quests; a typical ascension (the roguelike lingo for completing the ultimate quest and leaving the game) takes from a full day if you're just rushing everything to something closer to a week—even for experienced players. Virtually all the development decisions with regards to its content are also made by the same person, Thomas Biskup—the ageless director and Creator of ADOM. Obviously, there are some disadvantages to this approach, which served to be the main reason the game has at one point spent a decade in neglect, but this man's creativity and burning passion for hardcore RPGs, the fantasy, and the adventure, is what's taken it here—after more than 20 years since its inception. So when Thomas started a crowdsourcing campaign in 2012 to make massive updates to ADOM, I was among the people who contributed without a second thought. Getting ADOM here on Steam, which is almost unthinkable for a genre so niche and seemingly impenetrable, is a huge success. No-one thought this would be possible before the campaign ended. All of the funds that were raised were put to good use, and the backers recognize the main reason behind it: to give the development a strong push, not to make money out of a free product (more on this below).\n\nIf you've never played roguelikes, or have no experience with turn-based RPGs in particular, ADOM in its current form is definitely a good place to start. It's definitely a slow burner, and it might seem a little unforgiving at first, but don't discard it if your character keeps getting killed in the first 10 minutes. Try different approaches to the same problem, play to your character's strengths, take the easy ways and pay attention to many generous cues—all of this will be rewarded. At some point you might even decide to turn the graphical interface off and continue playing with good old ASCII—you'd be surprised how immersive can gameplay get if you let your imagination paint the picture. It works just like a good book. Although the monster designs are definitely sweet, and they make the game seem more like a Spiderweb Software RPGs—another dear favorites of mine.\n\nThose of you who have already tried ADOM many years ago and are wondering what is different about it these days are in luck: virtually every aspect of the game has seen improvements—often drastic ones! Difficulty curve is a lot less spiky now, most of the infamous exploits are fixed or toned down to sane levels, and there's quite a bit of new content to dabble in if you feel like it (none is shoved down your throat, mind—TB recognizes the game is long as is)—both semi-fixed and completely random. Even if you keep playing without graphics, I encourage you to leave the in-game music on: it fits the game quite well and definitely enhances the roguelike experience.\n\nSo, to sum up, if you enjoy some or most of:\nlarge, detailed, fantasy-themed worlds;\nexploring dangerous, non-linear series of dungeons, which you can enter methodically or try diving in early for their treasure and the adrenaline rush that comes with it;\nRPGs with heavily customizable characters and elaborate combat mechanics;\ngames that aren't afraid to challenge you and give choices with impactful, permanent consequences;\ngames that are immersive, detailed, and treat you like an intellectually capable person once you let go of the tutorial;\nthat immense feeling of reward when you have finally beat the game for the first time;\nachievements that are, for the most part, actual and commendable achievements;...ADOM just might be your top pick. It has its problems, but they're relatively minor and ultimately dwarfed by the good stuff.\n\nLet me conclude by saying this. Those of us who have been playing ADOM for years upon years don't do it because of nostalgia—we never did. It's because ADOM excels at what it has set out to do, and is constantly getting better at it. How many games you know have seen their authors grow into successful businessmen and yet still keep working hard upon improving and polishing a piece of creative effort they have started back in their college years? This game is an honest-to-god result of so much love, thought, and craft, that you'd be hard-pressed to find anything that compares. We play ADOM because we feel this. We play it because it's still genuinely fun. And by the way: if you don't want the fancy and convenient stuff in the Steam version of the game, the classic, fully-hardcore version of ADOM with the same fully up-to-date quests, mechanics, and content has been, and will always remain, distributed for free on the original site[www.adom.de]. This speaks of honesty and love more than anything else I could think of. Support it while you can!\n\nSo, would I recommend ADOM? Well now, why wouldn't I. Play it. Play the hell out of it! See you on D:50.","November 16, 2015","true","316.9"," 42 of 43 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","42","43","2","0"

The dread beast that inflicted the wounds upon you lies smoldering before you, the last of your power expended upon its ruin.  Through the doorway that led you to this chamber, you hear a thunderous 'HARUMPH'.  This can only mean ruin.  You frantically search your belongings, desperate for salvation.  You pray to your God, but the ground quakes at your request, a stern denial from your patron deity.  A tremendous stomping grows nearer, and you fear that your time is short.  Sweat pouring down your bleeding face, you find a Wand of Digging in your pack, intact but depleted of charges, alongside your Wand of Door Creation.  Like a man gone mad, you plunge the Wand of Digging into your only potion of Booze, and cry out when the wand glows once more.  You fire it behind you, creating a vast tunnel wherein you dash for safety.  You zap your Wand of Door creation behind you, and with your faintly regained power Magically Lock the summoned door.  You run down your new corridor, seeking escape, only to find another dead end.  The impossibly heavy steps of the impending creature grow close now, as you huddle in the corner of your shelter.  The steps cease, you hold your breath in sheer terror, silently attempting to gather yourself in meditation and regain power.  An explosion of splinters erupts from the other side of your corridor, and the many eyed horror that approaches from the gloom freezes you in your place.  You think of Terinyo as the horror steps toward you, you think of the home you left behind.  Your fear gives way to darkness, the darkness to silence; Ancardia's greatest hope extinguished like a torch in the rain.'\n\nYou die.  You survive.  You learn. ADOM is a game that offers you a canvas upon which to design your own adventure.  Are you a hero?  A villain?  Do you aspire to seal the forces of Chaos away, or reign over it a mad God for eternity?  Are you a simple farmer, far from home?  A gambler, seeking the highest stakes casino in all the world?  Call it a roguelike, call it a fantasy role playing sandbox, call it a sadistic RNG exercise, ADOM is all that and far more.  No experience is perfect, games crash, characters are lost.  ADOM is mysterious, and you may puzzle at the Scroll of Dark Predictions in your inventory, or the Tract of Chaos you see on the ground.  You may wander to the Tower of Eternal Flames, and enter without caution.  You die.  You survive.  You learn.  ADOM is a game of mystery, a game of skill, a game of chance.  Distinct from its peers, beloved by its fanbase, and better than ever here on Steam.  Don't fear the learning curve, if you've whiled away hours exploring Morrowind, Baldur's Gate, Fallout, this game may be the gateway to a genre you've never given a thought to before, as it was for me.","November 22, 2015","true","34.2"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","37","39","4","3"

In developement since 1994, and by reading over its history, I can say it has come a long way. This title can certainly hold its own right up  there with the best of modern games. Some may have you believe a single person (Thomas Biskup) built this, but as is stated in the credits, the end product is the result of thousands of peoples hard work and ideas. Certainly Mr. Biskup deserves the lion's share of credit, but compared to other indie titles, this is hardly something that came out of someones basement over the weekend.\n\nClassic roguelikes are nearly infinite in replayability, and possibility. Sure, there is a certain trade-off between user interface, graphics, and learning curve that pays out with a giant world with metric tons of gameplay and fun. Yes, its difficult. Yes, you will need to read lots (thank you in-game manual). Yes, it is FUN.\n\nPros:\n+Timeless game that has been shaped over 20 years, which is reflected by system complexity that goes unmatched in modern games.\n+The ability to seemlessly (simply push F10) switch between classic ASCII and tiles.\n+Tiles and music are beautifully done.\n+Many modes that are all well recieved. In example, Crowd mode alters the difficulty of your game by how many Steam friends you have that play ADOM. This is fresh and certainly encourages community.\n+++Highscores leaderboards!\n+++Ghosts of your fallen Steam friends show up in your game lol.\n+Both keyboard and mouse support. I find the control scheme very intuitive. The updated user interface is very nice IMO.\n+In-depth tutorial.\n+Great community.\n+Super active developement.\n\nCons:\n-Yeah there is a steep learning curve, but that only applies to people that are new to roguelikes. Get through it, or simply realize these types of games are not your cup of tea.\n\nIf you have any interest in PC gaming history at all, this title deserves to be in your library. What a gem. It amazes me how this classic has evolved over time and can still outcompete modern titles.","November 17, 2015","true","22.0"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","35","40","2","0"

For some reason it isn't on here, so I'm trying again.\n\nThis game is to roguelikes what Baldur's Gate is to CRPGs. After playing for over ten years, I can safely say that this is one of the best games I've ever played. The reason for this is it's strict dedication to its core mechanic -- you, dying.\n\nOne of the best descriptions I've ever heard of game mechanics was concerning Dark Souls, in that (paraphrased) "this is a game that is fair to the player -- always FAIR -- and the difficulty does not surprise you if you pay attention."\n\nADOM is like this. Sort of. Instead of there being ways to see what's ahead and then killing you a la Dark Souls, ADOM's core mechanic isn't actually dying. That's the means to teaching you. You will suffer legitimate losses of equipment, stats, companions, or everything you have in a gripping, slow or numbing, painless death. Then, you are expected - required - to learn from that experience in your next character.\n\nThis shows in everything that the game does. RPG classes in 99% of RPGs are meaningless. In ADOM, some are similar to eachother, but every class has at least one unique quality to them that will change the entirety of the game. Races are the same, with each having a sort of opposite, such as the Mist Elves and Trolls; M.Elves have unstoppable magical capabilities and dodging, but Trolls have towering health WITH regeneration (the MOST coveted skill in the game) and can massacre just about anything (can I just say Troll weaponsmith w/sword of sharpness? Yes, I CAN say that!) (... right before I died).\n\nI've been playing off and on, but the adventures have been memorable. I was introduced to the game by scumming and knew too little to understand that this was NOT as the game was designed. Once I found the ADOM Guidebook online, I started playing rogue (with a little experimentation). My first winning playthrough was a Human Fighter, Phaeton; he ran into a vault of Greater Molochs. It took me HOURS to kill just one, but once I did, my level rocketed and I was able to kill each one easier until my 100 Courage could take on 2-3 at a time, hitting lvl50 in no time. The Balors at the end nearly killed me, but I desperately used a scroll of familiar summoning and hit the jackpot -- a Greater Flame Elemental killed literally everything but me on the entire floor. I just followed it around and picked through the carnage. My second playthrough was a Wizard, Gafgarion, that died in the duel with Nuurag-Vaarn. When 1.2.0 was released, I dove in head first with a LOT of attempts, but finally got a High Elven Paladin, Matthias, and for the first time I got Justifier. For those who don't know, this may be one of the best non-minmax occurrences in the game. I edited my sprite to epic proportions, turning Justifier into the Master Sword from Zelda, and mopped through every dungeon. You think such imbalance isn't fun after while... until your save loads a JSON error and corrupts, thereby losing everything.\n\nNow that I'm done rambling, here's what makes this Steam version special. You can remove all of what I just talked about. However, that's not such a bad thing. What the Steam release signifies is a willingness to accept new players. The depth and complexity of content in ADOM is such that I probably haven't seen half of it. And it's probably only going to get bigger. Therefore, it makes sense to have ways to let players explore it. There's still tons wrong with it, as one review brought up the online-only functionality. This doesn't really bother me. Unless he's travelling in the bush (doubtful), turn on hotspot on your phone for 5 mins. The act of getting ADOM on Steam in a saleable format was probably a Herculean task, and so I expect errors. Any aspersions against customer sales disrespect are fallacious and made by people who have clearly never perused the forums or seen comments made by Thomas Biskup. Since Morrowind modding, I have never seen such a dedicated community of collaborative effort.\n\nIt has never been a better age to get into roguelikes, and this game is one of the best. If you've been poisoned against rogues by the more recent entries in the genre, give a classic a try and see what made them great to begin with.","November 25, 2015","true","32.5"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","25","27","0","0"

It has given me more enjoyment and more play time than any title I have gotten my mitts on in that time period. My only regret is that I couldnt throw piles of money at the developer when he put the indigogo project up for the revival project.\n\nTo new players to the game dont be discouraged if you lose many characters in the very beginning. Some you will lose to the difficulty, Many you will lose to ignorance or stupidity, some losses will be heartbreaking and others will be hillarious. But no game will fill you with more personal satisfaction then when you get your first character to close that damn portal...... dear god it took me 15 years to win, many came close but hopes were dashed on one monstrous boss or another.\n\nAt some point in the near future I will finally be able to complete the IRL postcard quest and pay my respects to this shiney golden god of indie game development. Thomas my hat goes off to you. I would recommend this game to anyone with a pulse, I have played this game longer than anything else over the years and it will continue to be my most played game for many MANY years to come.\n\nPS for the love of god and all that is holy, kill as few cats tigers and lions as possible - the catlord is a vengeful sort and gets spooky as hell if you kill to many.

This is the first time I've played ADOM, but not the first roguelike I've played.  I've heard about ADOM for a long time but never played it.  I heard it was coming to Steam, so I thought I would give it a try.  So far, it seems very good.  There are a lot of options, things like your character's backstory are very well done.  I have to say, I really enjoy the tileset.  To me it's nicer than Tome's tileset.  Tome's tileset is almost too detailed to sit well with a roguelike, it kind of gets into the "uncanny valley" territory.  ADOM's tileset is HD, yet stylistically better.  The details are smooth and well done, but it avoids the mistake of trying to put too much detail into a tile.\n\nIf you like games like Caves of Qud, Tome, or roguelikes in general, this is a great game and you will enjoy it.  The devs seem very eager to improve the game and listen to their community.\n\nThe only complaint I have is there are a lot of strange key combinations that maybe would be better off in a menu (like if you push esc).  It's not bad by any means, but the UI could use a bit of streamlining.  Key combinations (like CTRL+nm) are just really archaic and not really acceptable in this day and age.

It features several dozen different dungeons, some with fixed layout and others randomly generated each time you play.  It also has an 'overworld' adventure map, which was an unique feature in ADOM's young days.\n\nThere are a lot of different character types you can make from a big selection of races and classes who can pursue multiple different endings.  Save the world from ChAoS as a Troll Paladin, or maybe take the place of the elder chaos god Andor Drakon as a Hurthling Farmer? Anything goes.\n\nADOM has always been and will continue to be freeware, downloadable from the developer site adom.de.  Recent features include the graphical Noteye tileset that vastly improves the visual appeal.\n\nOn Steam, the Deluxe version promises a slew of additional features, many of which at the time of this review several months after release have not been realized in the game.  This is a point worthy of critique.  The small development team working on ADOM have always done things in their own pace, which is perfectly fine for a freeware hobby project.  However with a Steam release comes expectations of promises being delivered on.  As much as I love the devs and the wonderful game they've created, this must be pointed out.  While ADOM is a complete game in its own right, the DELUXE version is far from complete.\n\nThat bit of complaining aside, ADOM is a beautiful game.  It is a brutal, oldschool roguelike with such a staggering depth that even with the community wiki on hand, it can take years to uncover all its tricks and secrets.  It will kill hundreds of characters, often just when you felt they were getting somewhere before you can even think about beating the whole game.  It has the replayability for the game to still be addicting to play for all those attempts, with all its character variations and random generated nature.  In fact, I recommend this game not for the story and reaching its ending, but for all the journeys your poor doomed characters embark on before they inevitably get crushed.\n\nIf you like turnbased dungeon crawling, traditional roguelikes with deep systems that you will keep learning new things in even after years of playing, ADOM comes strongly recommended.  However!  I would suggest playing the freeware version on adom.de first.  Unless you just want to support the developers of course (which you should!).  The Deluxe version of the game on Steam doesn't as of yet add much of features to justify a price tag.  Once implemented I think the Steam version will be safely recommended, as well.","March 19","true","158.9"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","20","20","0","0"

It's a great roguelike with many quests, large world map with many types of dungeons and  large variety of classes and races.

Finding desired loot is difficult, thus good items are more meaningful. I absolutely love the magic system (as opposed to other roguelikes such as Stone Soup) - you learn spells through books which you don't have to carry around (you cast them from your memory for a limited number of times e.g. 700- which can be increased with other books), the spells get better as you use them.

ADOM is a demanding and difficult game with permadeath coming at you around every corner. Several secret handshakes that you just got to learn about the hard way. And it's not even really fair at all times. Also you will be consulting a wiki often.\n\nHowever,\n\nThe sense of reward in this game is unparalleled. When you kill that Ancient Chaos Wyrm with one tremendous blow from your Vanquisher, getting revenge for those five other promising characters who died to him. Or when you finally get that one race/class/sign combo running properly that you've been trying for ages.\n\nThere is a lot of death in this game no doubt, but the huge variety you can have with character creation added to the general randomness of the game makes every adventure significantly different. The replay value of this game is immense. Dying means that you get to try something new once again!\n\nAs you start out, you might be spending as much time reading a wiki as you are playing. That's okay, there are no real spoilers in this game. Knowing everything beforehand does not really affect your experience in any negative way. And there is a fun sense of mystique; even after years of play you'll be learning new things.\n\nThe steam edition packs this classic of a game in a neat and functional package. Definitely worth the price when it comes to amount of gameplay. Also worth it for the veterans. Though if you are very particular to ascii graphics (though you can play this version in ascii aswell), you might not find enough new features as of yet.\n\nDefinitely one of the better games ever made!","November 26, 2015","true","154.6"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

I've since spent hundreds of hours exploring the mysterious Drakalor Chain. ADOM is one of my all-time favourite games, and certainly the only game originally released in the 90's that I don't play for nostalgia - but because it is still fresh.\n\nADOM is an RPG in the true sense of the word: it does not impose restrictions on you. The problem I have with most RPGs these days is how they limit the player's actions. The choice between good and evil is often in fact the choice between the good and evil dialogue option. ADOM is different in that you can actually do whatever you want, be anyone you want to be. And doing whatever you want actually means something in ADOM, since the game has a ridiculously large amount of content. Really, it does.\n\n- Gameplay -\n\nIn ADOM, first you'll create your character. Your character will be given a starsign that will have some effect on him/her. After that you'll choose your race, profession, talents etc. from a ton of options. These choises will guide you as you start your journey, but won't limit you as (or if) you progress.\n\nAs the game begins, you enter Drakalor Chain, a troubled valley with many mysteries to explore. From then on it's all up to you. Go to the nearest village and interact with the townsfolk or find your own path. Battle fierce beasts, learn incredible spells, rob stores, fight for money, make friends, embark on quests, search for artifacts, brew deadly poisons, control minds, barter items, cook food, worship your gods, play instruments, raise the dead, clean your ears...\n\nAnd of course you'll die. You'll be drowned, burnt and crushed to death. You'll die of hunger and sickness and bloodloss. You'll accidentally kill yourself conducting dangerous magical experiments. You'll die as you are sacrificed to strange and terrible gods. You'll die and return. And maybe, just maybe you'll one day defeat the powers that plague Drakalor Chain. I never did, yet, but I'll keep on trying.\n\nSee you in the Caverns of Chaos!","November 16, 2015","true","27.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I have been playing this since 1996. This game will make you rage quit and scream about how you will never play it again and an hour later, there you are playing again. The depth of this game is unrivaled by anything. You will encounter mind boggling scenarios and unimaginable deaths. For instance, I was walking through a dungeon once and I heard a water trap go off. I came around a corner and I was blown to bits by fiery death. As I sat there wondering what in the hell just happened, I came to realize that a goblin had stepped on the water trap that I had heard go off and when he got hit with the water, a potion that he was carrying reacted with the water and exploded. Or how about the time I ate a kobold corpse that made me sick and then promptly got bit by a ghoul that paralyzed me and I choked to death on my own vomit? Yes, this kind of stuff actually happens.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vesmo/recommended/333300/","vesmo","vesmo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vesmo/","74 products in account","ADOM is the definitive rogue-like experience. If you're a fan of rogue-likes, you've probably played ADOM already. However, this is the first of the classic rogue-likes to make its way into Steam and a wide new audience. People who are interested in rogue-like themes and the so called rogue-lite games might find a lot to like here.\n\nAs a rogue-like, ADOM is a turn-based RPG. This means that every time you take an action, all of the other characters in the game do so as well, including enemies. In a sense, it's not really turn-based as all the movement happens at once, meaning you never have to wait for the enemy's movement. Combat is a simple matter at ground level but gets more complex as the game progresses. In its most basic form, you are simply "running" into enemies. This causes you to attack them and they will attack back at you and so on. However, you can influence this combat in many ways. This includes switching your tactics to gain better to-hit chance and damage at the expense of defenses (can be used flexibly and in different ways depending on the situation), casting spells, drinking potions, zapping wands, reading scrolls, firing missiles, using skills and maneuvering around the dungeon to name a few. Trash mobs you can simply run into and destroy with ease, but whenever you encounter a new and unknown, potentially strong monster, you might want to slow down the pace and consider what gear you have to help you. And remember the number one rule of rogue-likes: always have an escape plan in mind!\n\nADOM is absolutely brutal. Rogue-lite games often mention how they are extremely difficult and will require multiple tries before you beat them. These games also tend to be relatively short, 1-2 hour experiences in various genres from fps to platformers. ADOM on the other hand is a purebred rogue-like through and through; a successful game is likely to take 15+ hours and the hundreds of failures you will suffer on the way will add even more hours on top of that. Now I happen to think this is a strength; there is immense amounts of replayability in the game due to a variety of races and classes you can play as, in addition to a huge amount of procedural generation when it comes to monsters you encounter, loot you find and dungeon layouts you will explore. And once you beat the game normally, guess what! There's several Ultra Endings to attempt as well! These endings are insanely hard to pull off, require EVEN more tries than the normal one and are virtually impossible without some outside information sources.\n\nADOM's strength in relation to other rogue-likes lies in its structured nature: Terinyo is always in the same place as well as the main dungeons of the game. There are quests that you will undertake in a logical order and once you learn your way around the early game, it is possible to form a strategy. This is absolutely key; where many rogue-likes hinge purely on RNG to get you going, ADOM actually has a very deep strategy layer to its gameplay. The other notable selling point in relation to other rogue-likes is the skill system; every race and class has a set of skills they start off with, and these skills can be improved as you advance in levels. This gives leveling a more meaningful feeling compared to some other rogue-likes where you simply gain more health and magic points.\n\nNow this review could go on forever, but hopefully I've given you some insight into whether or not ADOM is something you might be into. Personally, I love this game. I have beaten it three times the normal way and once I've achieved the Avatar of Order ending. I've played this game over the course of 15 years, two development cycles and who knows how many hours. It is truly something special.\n\nLastly, some meta-advice:\n\n-Do not play the game in softcore mode! Permadeath is an integral part of the rogue-like experience and you will hate ADOM if you don't have permadeath on. A character is very likely to die; you have to learn to deal with it. The entire premise of the game is that you roll hundreds of characters until finally one of them sticks and gets farther into the game than the others. If you keep struggling with a character who was never even meant to survive the experience will be miserable. Not to mention you will never have that feeling of utter disaster when your best character dies at the final level. Or on the way back after winning the game. And all of those losses will build up to the final success; when you finally, after all that heartbreak, beat the game and leave Drakalor Chain, you look back at the time you've spent and go: "♥♥♥♥ yes, I actually did it. I beat this son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ of a game. Hell yes."\n\n-Don't be afraid to look up stuff on the wiki: ADOM is a massive game and very cryptic in some areas. However, I would suggest avoiding making a habit out of this. Explore the game freely; you're going to die so many times anyway so what's the point of completely spoiling yourself? But once you get a promising character rolling, you might want to check up on the effects of eating this specific monster's corpse, or how dangerous exactly that Gorgon is ;)\n\n-Give the ASCII version a try! The tilesets are very nicely done and the bare-bones ASCII style might seem clunky and unintuitive at first. But you'd be surprised at the advantages it has. For example, you will easily identify new enemies: a small "g" is always going to be a goblin-like small humanoid, an uppercase "D" is always going to be a dragon or dragon-like huge lizard like drake and so on. Very clear and handy compared to the tilesets imo. Not to mention the ASCII graphics are just so damn charming!\n\n-vesmo","November 16, 2015","true","63.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

To support Thomas and his team to keep adding to it, cleaning up bugs, making more options. I did. Its totally worth it for any die hard fan. It has full tiles, done really well. But it also has the capability for the old school ASCII that was all that existed until just a couple years ago. Its deep, its awesome, its everything a Roguelike should be. It and a few others pretty much defined the genre in the early 90s. If you dont have a copy, you have no right saying youre into Roguelikes.

Whether to stand and fight, or run away and heal. Whether to kick down a door and risk activating a trap, or come back later with a key. Whether to risk delving one level deeper, or travel to a safer location. Making the wrong call will often lead to an early death, but negotiate these issues and your character will be set up for the challenges that follow.\n\nFor newcomers to the game, I advise choosing a stong melee character (e.g. an orc fighter), and start in the tutorial dungeon to get used to the basics of moving around and hitting things with swords. This is what you'll be doing for the majority of the time, regardless of class. You can then let the complexities of the other mechanics seep in over time.\n\nI used to play a lot of the ASCII version, but not so much recently. I'm already impressed with the new graphical tileset and other features which are in this version, and the game underneath is still the exciting combination of exploration and danger it always was.","November 20, 2015","true","66.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Haven't managed to finish one yet, but the great thing about this game is that it doesn't really matter that much. It's not about winning. It's about your character, that you'll be scared for, that you'll pray for, that you'll coddle up and train. You'll be angry at fate, god or just the rng, you'll laugh at stupid deaths, you'll get surges of adrenaline at the sight of that out-of-depth monster around the corner and be immensely relieved when you make it to the next staircase without being followed. Pride when you get out of a situation that looked completely desperate by using your wits, disbelief when you finally identify your stuff and see that you've been carrying around 2 (!!) amulets of life saving, anger at yourself when you lose that really promising character just because you didn't stop playing in time (when you noticed your eyes started itching and your vision got a bit blurry, but hey, you just couldn't leave the game at that point, no way...)\nI'm really no game expert, I don't have any comparison to other roguelikes or any other computer games for that matter. But what I love about ADOM is that it's creating stories. Of course there is the ingame storyline, but it's also creating stories in your mind. Even in plain ascii mode, maybe especially there. Your heartrate goes up at the sight of a yellow & and you start hating the sight of any kind of f.

The explanation for this was polishing the game for the general steam audience rather than the more forgiving hardcore old fans of the game. Despite this, it is not really ready for a general audience despite there being easily enough time to prepare it.\n\n1. The game can crash: I experienced a crash within my first two hours of play. The game is permadeath but does autosave every 1000 turns. The problem is that in order to recover from a crash you have to know what you are doing and rename a certain file a certain way. The game is not programmed to realize it hasn't shut down cleanly so it can't help you.seems fixed\n\n2. There is mouse control but it's not total, meaning you have to press keys sometimes. It's not easy to even predict when you'll have to press a key rather than being able to use the mouse.\n\n3. The default keys are really bad from a HCI point of view (human-computer interaction): For example to rest to regain hp etc. until something disturbs you is w5 or w. That's a two key sequence for something you will be doing all the time. Even worse is the autoexplore which is w?. That's a two key sequence with the second key requiring shift! This for something you will also be doing constantly. auto-explore is now - (minus) (casting spells as shift z, (pick spell letter), direction is bad too although is being changed to non shifted z which is slightly better)\n\n4. It is possible to redefine the keys but unless you are an old player of adom or go looking on forums you wouldn't know how to. You have to go and get the config key file from where the game saves game data to (as in not the base game directory, e.g. for me it's C:\Users\<username>\Documents\ADOM\adom_steam) edit it in a text editor (and you have to know how to) and then put it in the right directory.\n\n5. There are certain features "coming soon". They include things like points-based character creation and being able to choose your star sign. Despite these things really not taking very long at all to program, they have been languishing on todo lists for ages. One of these at least was used by the greenlight campaign as an example of something that would be exclusive to the steam version and yet somehow didn't get programmed in the year and a half between being greenlit and steam release. (It's a couple of hours' work at the most).","November 16, 2015","true","25.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

You need to be patient and learn/ list lots of commands on the keyboard.\n\n\nI first played ADOM around 2003-2004. We had a crappy computer which couldn't handle many games at all, but my brother had ADOM on it. I tested it and was instantly hooked: So much to explore, so hard! Only one life? The merciless roguelike system where the game is permanently over when you die made me curious.\n\nThe added graphics are quite nice addition to the game and I imagine it's easier for new players to get into the game. I use only the keyboard controls for the game, as it is much faster (and I've played it for years so it comes natural). I recommend tackling the keyboard commands if you want faster gameplay.\n\nThere are so many ways you can be good (or bad) at this game. The game has been around for decades so it is well-balanced, but also still very challenging. I haven't still finished this game without "cheating", that is what was known as save scumming, where you copy the save file in case you die and continue game from there. I died just once to a stupid mistake which I don't remember anymore, but it still annoys me, even after multiple years. I'm fully determined to finish ADOM in the near future...\nIn a nutshell, the reasons I enjoy playing ADOM:\n- Challenging enough\n- Addictive - you'll probably end up screaming like a maniac for dying, swear you had enough ADOM for a week, only to find yourself trying a new character 10 minutes later\n- Variable - Dozens, if not hundreds of ways to play the game (race, class combinations + different endings, quests to pursue, places to visit)\n- Unpredictable - You might get mighty lucky early in the game, or really unlucky (dying to a random stone block trap early on for example), or both at the same, or neither. Just like life!\n- Bang for your buck - If you end up liking this game, you will probably enjoy it for years - I estimate that I have played more than 1000 hours pre-steam\n\nIf you decide to buy the game: Don't totally spoil yourself reading guides beforehand - just go to places, explore them and read late-game guides only if you get stuck to some place. Trust me, you will enjoy the exploration more on your own.","November 17, 2015","true","87.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I had played it before the kickstarted campaign for the graphical version and had enjoyed it then, and I enjoy it now even more. It just offers a lot of depth and complexety, I can really dive into the game. The world really feels alive. I also enjoyed TOME, the other great classical roguelike, but somehow I always preferred ADOM. TOME just feels more like game, with its MMO-like skills, while ADOM has the typical quirkiness and complexety of games like nethack, just with a persistent overworld and an actual story, which for me is more immersive.\n\nI like the music, the tilesets and the many possible options, the mouse control. The loading times are pretty much non-existent, which isn't the case for TOME for example. But it still expects much the users to use the non-intuitive outdated old keyboard-shortcuts.\n\nADOM is hard and unforgiving. The new ingame tutorial doesn't change that. I would recommend reading the beginners guides on the wiki and the ingame manual. It's a game for people who have a lot of patience and are prepared to die early. I contrast to most rogue-lites and also many roguelikes, such as TOME, I always grow attached to my characters, so having them die is even more painful.\n\nTl;dr: ADOM is still one of the best games for roguelike fans who like depth and are prepared to die a lot and I am positvely surprised of the technical overhaul. But it's still nothing for people who simply want to explore a world and don't like reading manuals.\n","December 1, 2015","true","18.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

To describe it as "hard" would be both true and misleading: It's actually very easy to play and very easy to make a lot of progress, but actually winning is a delicate and unlikely affair. Dying is practically inevitable and although in the "Deluxe" version it's possible to turn off perma-death it's certainly not in the spirit of the game to do so. I can't even begin to enumerate the number of games I've played but I've saved well over a hundred memorials to "notable" dead characters on this computer alone. I have only approached the approximate half-way point twice, I have never come close to winning... and still I play, because what keeps me coming back is the variety and the challenge.\n\nThis is not a game you will win in a weekend, or a month, or a year, but you will enjoy every session (right up to the moment you die). I encourage you, dear reader, to cough up the meager sum that is asked here for this gem and immerse yourself in a wonderful game in which the developer has truly Thought Of Everything. If mud splashes on your face it blinds you until you wipe it away. If it's dark or you're illiterate you can't read books or scrolls; if you're deaf you can't hear what NPCs say to you, but the wail of a banshee will also not affect you. Sometimes kicking things breaks them, sometimes it just hurts your leg. You can eat the raw corpse of a hurthling but it will taste better and sustain you longer if you cook it first.  The texture and depth is incredible and, thanks to randomly generated elements, your choice of race, class and winning strategy it's never quite the same twice.\n\nFor new players I recommend three things: Patience, determination, and to avoid standing directly in front of doors when opening them. Your reward: endless fun.","November 16, 2015","true","0.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

What kind of dungeon is this?  IT'S ADOM!\n\nWelcome to the only world you'll ever want to live in for the foreseeable future!  Filled with an amazing and detailed story, ADOM is the true definition of Rogue-like.  But unlike many other Roguelikes that you'll find on steam, Ancient Domains of Mystery really does make you worry about losing your character, while simultaneously making you want to start again the second you die.  From exploring caves to finishing quests for unique items, ADOM has something for everyone.  And now with its new (and totally optional) UI, it even has graphics for those who can't stand nethack.\n\nI have been playing ADOM pre 1.0 release and I am SO happy to see this game brought to life.  The Creator Thomas Biskup has been working on this game for so long and each new release has had me crawling around in Ancardia looking at the new changes and updates.   Now that it's on Steam, I am happy to spend my money to support the ADOM crew and continue to keep this jewel alive.\n\nI highly urge users to try to the ASCII version prior to playing with the graphical version.  I say this because it will absolutely help you understand the mechanics and probabilities of this game.  I don't personally care for the graphical version, but being a fan of skyrim and fallout, I can also understand the longing for something more than ASCII characters moving around.\n\nI also highly recommend checking out the wikia.  The world of Ancardia is so full and detailed, that it will help you immensely to look up your class and race to see what fun specialties they afford you!  Many have fun skills you can only have as certain races.  Be prepared to immerse yourself and realize how much fun the game can be!\n\n*Disclaimer:\nThere are absolutely traps in this game!  Dr VectorX is in no way responsible for damages caused by in-game traps.  Damage liability waiver includes: burning, freezing, falling, impalement by spear, impalement by arrow, crushing by giant rocks, spawning of giant golems, death by rats, death by wolves, death by acid, death by explosion, death by confusion leading to falling down a hole, death by teleportation into a deadly mob of feral pixies who tear you to pieces after you comment about how tasty the remains of their brethren are, death by spawning of <color> dragon, death by starvation, death by water causing all the gremlin cotton balls to reconstitute and mob you for not cleaning your pockets, death by being eaten by a grue, death by drinking a random unknown pool of liquid and effects thereof, death by zombie, death by ninja, death by dwarf, death caused by mud in the face, death from not knowing how to wipe ones face, death from clean ears, death by metal poisoning, death by curse, death caused by riches, i.e. over abundance of gold pieces, death from drinking a potion you foolishly didn't identify, death accidentally bouncing magic off a wall and catching yourself in the never ending ricocheting magic, and any other magic related deaths.  All complaints should be directed to the Creator hotline.\n\nEDIT (11/18/15):\n\nThe game currently has stability issues with the steam version.  Because I like this game so much and I want people to be able to see how good this game is without the unfortunate launch day issues that plague many games (squinty glare at CoD), I want to inform everyone that they may try ADOM for FREE.  The only catch is that the releases are not the latest ones.  However, they are stable and STEAM free.  You can find them on the link below.\n\nhttp://www.adom.de/home/downloads.html\n\nYou can download BOTH the graphical UI version AND the ASCII version.

I have been playing this game for more years than my 'time played' would suggest, and for people who love a good roguelike RPG, I can honestly say that I have yet to find a better one. A huge world (for a roguelike), many quests, secrets, Easter Eggs, character customization, achievements, challenges.... this game is an absolute *gem*.\n\nBe aware: like all good(?) roguelikes, this is not a game for the faint of heart. Even with an 'easymode' to it, it can have a very steep learning curve, and your deaths will be spectacular. A lot of weight can hang on the Will Of The RNG. The right weapon at the right time, or the wrong roll at the wrong time, can make or break a game. Be aware that while skill counts heavily, it's all too possible to find yourself in a situation where one mislaid trap can be the diffeence between life and death.\n\nIt's a game I wouldn't trade for the world, though, and one that is worth every penny paid for it.

Many have been written already, ADOM is an ancient game after all.\nNo, I'm here because I have this bottle of wine and this wonderful game and all I wanted, besides rambling on Steam, was to give my thanks. So here's to you Mr. Biskup! Thank you for a wonderful game! I'm too lazy to complete the postcard quest, but I can at least drink this glass of wine in your honor.\nI was struck by this compelling need to write a few words about ADOM while trying another game. I won't name it but it's also free and also highly regarded by many. I already had a bit of experience with ADOM but nothing to compare it against. I quickly decided that the 2nd game is not my cup of tea, but it helped me realize what a gem ADOM really is. I played it quite a while, first the free version and then the Steam version, and I am still charmed by its music, by its atmosphere, by its depth. Even the minimalist tileset is charming.\nNow I have all this hunger to master the game. It's slowly becoming an addiction, trying to go deeper or further than the last time. I'm learning bits and pieces and having a grand time. It's like learning to juggle, every time adding one more ball to an already incredible act. Even death is sometimes fun. Last night I laughed as I died, heavily poisoned, right after emerging victorious close to HMV. The Gods were tired of my nagging to them and chose not to answer me. But who cares, one more ball was added to the juggle.\nAnyway, to all of you trying to decide the game's worth based on Steam reviews: get it, pour a glass of wine and join me in my quest to master this wonderful game.","April 14","true","104.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","6","9","3","0"

That is only partly true. The truth is that I've been playing this game since August, 1998. So it's basically like... 17 years. Soon my playtime will be permitted to buy alcohol and smokes. I remember the time when with my best friend we sent a postcard to the creator, Thomas Biskup, because back then ADOM was "postcard-ware" - when you wanted to thank the developer, you just had to go to the post office and send a postcard. It is worth every penny considering the game's been free for over 20 years and you can still check the free, older versions at adom.de\n\nNow ADOM is on Steam and for ~15 euro you can experience one of the hardest, most challenging, vague (in terms of "what should I do now?") and merciless games of all time. ADOM is one of the legendary roguelike games. That means permadeath after 30hrs of game, that means all your scrolls getting soaked because you forgot to grab that damned blanket, that means drowning, because the ice you created with ice bolt just cracked and you and all your belongings are gone, that means getting burned because one of your fire resistance rings isn't blessed, that means almost crying when you see game message stating: *THUMP*. Finally that means checking every class combination and getting acquainted with ADOM Bible or some other, newer guidelike stuff, because you think that there is some magic formula, a cheat, a "best class combination -> enter google" that will allow you to "win". That if you create a trollish healer born under the Candle star sign, you will magically plow through the Caverns of Chaos and win the game.\n\n\nAnd then, on level three of some random dungeon you stumble upon undead vault.\n\n\nADOM went through a lot during over 20 years of development - now you have graphics engine, you can choose a lot more during character creation, finally - you have a "cheat engine" so to speak, so you can try to go through the whole game without permadeath - as far as I understand, I've never tried this mode, because ADOM is in a way something that games like "Dark Souls" aspire to - you die, you learn, you die again. After a thousand deaths, you die once more, but you try again.\n\nDuring the "ADOM hiatus" a lot of other games emerged - ToME, Elona, and finally - a lot of lighthearted roguelike(like)s.\n\nI never thought I would live to see this day.

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of indie rogue-like Ancient Domains of Mystery (ADOM). ADOM was released on November 16, 2015 on Steam by a team headed by Thomas Biskup, including: Jochen Terstiege, Zeno Rogue, Krzysztof Dycha & Lucas Dieguez.\n\n(NOTE: This review was produced by using a key for the game that was provided by the Developer/Publisher)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zMMjOCStQfE\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nSTEEP learning curve. Sky high difficulty. Permadeath. TON of replayability. Short on Graphics, Audio.\n3/5 but a MUST if you're a rogue-like fan.\n\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nThis has been a very difficult game for me to review. It is a solid game. I am totally getting the hang of it just fine and enjoy the genre. However, these controls are still stuck in 1994. The graphics and sound are too. But wait, there is a LOT more to this game. First, the character creation alone is immensely deep. It's really great. Oh sure, you can randomize your hero/anti-hero (yup, you can be evil. why not?), their class, race, stats. You can also choose them yourself. There are quite a few to choose from. Even better, you go through a nice little quiz (or you can randomize this too) to determine some things about your character. This makes for tons of different combos and ways to play the game. I absolutely LOVE this aspect of this game. It is straight RPG with it's abilities, talents, etc. right down to rating them by dice roll and modifier. The controls though. It takes a long time to master these controls. SO much going on all over the keyboard. I feel like some of this could be somewhat simplified, but maybe I am wrong. There really is an crazy amount of depth to this little rogue-like. Fully fleshed out tons and NPC's to be found. All in all, for your average gamer there is a lot to consume here. This is not light gaming at all. More like a Paradox game or Wargaming (a la Ageod games, etc.) there is a lot to master before being able to fully enjoy this game.

I typically read many reviews beforehand - so it's not necessary to return games.  In the case of ADOM, most of the reviews fail to mention any of the issues associated with the numerous keybindings required to play the game in an enjoyable fashion.  I didn't notice until after returning the game that most of the negative reviews were unfairly down voted for mentioning critical issues associated with poor mouse controls.\n\nThe controls are clunky and the game requires too much memorization of key bindings to play.  Most of the positive reviews posted on Steam are likely from long time players who memorized the long list of key bindings a long time ago.  For new players - this will likely be a highly unpleasant experience because of the aforementioned poor user interface and reliance on key bindings.\n\nThere are free versions of this game that you can try out before buying.  I highly recommend any new player to this game to download a free version and try out the controls first hand before purchasing on Steam.  You will easily discover if the controls bother you or not.   Like the other reviews that mention ADOM's outdated reliance keybindings and clunky controls, I expect my review to be down-voted.  I'm okay with that if it means saving other Steam users money.  The limited time listed of me playing this game is actually overstating my time spent on this game.  90% of that time was actually spent reading up on one of the many outdated keybindings required to play before deciding to uninstall the game.","January 3","false","0.8"," 68 of 130 people (52%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","52","68","130","11","11"

The three consist of Angband (specifically T.O.M.E and its predecessors for me), Nethack and (of course) ADOM.\n\nADOM was probably the game the least like the others in terms of how everything worked. It allowed for extremes of overly complicated OR remarkably simple gameplay and has a depth far beyond any roguelike from its time and for that matter most roguelikes ever.\n\nOnce you've spent some time getting sufficiently spoiled (you kinda have to to finish the game), you'll end up chasing ultra endings and then you can pretty much kiss your free time goodbye.

I've been excited ever since the crowdfunding campaing, and been singing praises of this game ever since. It's brutal, hard and random, yes, but such is the nature of TRUE rogue-likes.\n\nDeluxe version gives you the options to lower the difficulty for more casual of players, so they can get enjoyment out of this game as well. Even giving you option to properly save your game, unlike the normal mode, where your game save is tied to your characters life, once character dies, it's gone. This is something not available in the free version. More on that later.\n\nBut the true meat of this game comes from flexibility of the combat... You have your basic Melee, Ranged and Magic attacks, but you also can use Mindcraft, companions, special race/class abilities and alchemy to name a few varied methods of dealing damage. But you can in turn take damage from ridiculous stuff among others, and get killed in many, many ways, including getting crushed by dungeon, whipping yourself to death, getting sacrificed to one of many gods, having too much stuff in your inventory and my personal favorite: Getting eaten by grue. Also, you can get killed before you even move (or take your first step) with certain race/class combinations on certain day.\n\nThere are plenty of static elements in game that stay same from game to game, but majority of the dungeons are randomly generated, keeping you on your toes every time. No two games are the same, which makes this game highly replayable.\n\nDeluxe version of ADOM is not only worth your money, but as it gets more features, which will keep coming until the Creator of this game feels this game is complete (and moves onto the Sequel) makes this game truly worthwhile. But if you are not certain of getting the Deluxe version yet, you can always download the Free version of this game from ADOM homepage, and try it out as much you want. The base game is the same regardless, but There are bunch of nifty features that will not be in the free versions ever. But if you so desire, you can run the newest free version of this game on your Amiga or old MS-Dos computers. That's how old-school this game is.","November 16, 2015","true","10.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

How to review ADOM? Well, it's one of the Great Few, an actual roguelike (not roguelikelike or light or anything) that helped define the genre. ADOM's strongest points are a mix of a persistent plot with procedurally generated elements, and a much deeper lore than its kin.\n\nOnce again the ultimate evil raises its ugly head and only a single hero can defeat it because fate says so. That hero is you. Or, will be you. Eventually you will defeat evil. But before that, you will die. A lot. And then again, and then some more. And you'll probably love every single death because you learned something, or had the chance to try out a new trick, or just had a brief moment of clarity how something COULD be done, only you didn't do it.\n\nADOM "Steam" is a pretty huge package. While the original game can be played for free, this version comes with a nice set of "deluxe" options and, seriously, this is a game that has been around for ages. I played it for ages. I think it's fair that at some point someone gets a bit of my money for the entertainment I had, because this is a game made for old dogs like me. A perfect throwback to my teen years, not pimped out until it's no longer the game I learned to love but with a nice, sensible lick of paint and a sleek interface. And I can still have it all in ASCII if I want.\n\nThere's just no way not to recommend this game.\nIf you already know it, you want to buy it for the same reasons I did: For nostalgia, for running the dungeons again, for feeling the thrill of a fight where each move matters, for smiling at the fact that your Steam Playtime can never, ever, match the hours you already sunk into this monster.\nIf you never heard of ADOM, you want to try it out because it is a nicely structured, engrossing game that polishes some concepts of the genre to a silky sheen. You'll appreciate the interface, which is readable but doesn't get in your way, you'll start out small and then you'll be hooked.\n\nAll this said, it's still a roguelike. As in, one of the games that took care we HAVE roguelikes. There are many things here that are part of the genre but not to everyone's taste- a fairly rocky early game, permadeath, TONS of ways to die yeat another stupid death, and an omnipresent element of randomness that can, and will, screw you up big time at least once per run. ADOM doesn't pull any punches and you need to be aware of that, this is not a recent rogue-light, this is bedrock. If you are just curious what the craze is all about, you may want to try the free version, just to see how it sits with you.\n\nBecause like most old roguelikes, ADOM is a game that rewards patience, planning, developing strategies and preparing for the worst- while still allowing players to improvise and come out of a tight spot with some sweet experience and a new trick in their book.\n\n15 Euros can buy you more recent, visually impressive, or (to be honest) more streamlined games after all, but ADOM takes time to master, and beating it once is nothing, considering the endless replayability the genre itself has to offer.\n\nHappy dungeon-dwelling, spell-singing and corpse-cursing!","November 16, 2015","true","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

We have dedicated uncountable hours to this game, improving our talents/skill choices, learning which monsters are dangerous (nearly all of them in their own way, even as food!), how to not starve to death, how to infer properties of unidentified items, how to make your deity happy (very useful), to always eat ogre and blink dog corpses, and that you should never attempt any alchemy as an amateur no matter how innocent appearing (not even mixing water and carrot juice).\n\nYet not once have any of us beat the game.

While most roguelikes' difficulty is heavily tilted to the start of the game, ADOM provides a reasonably reliable start via the beginning town/tutorial cave no matter how weak a character you roll.

Wrote my own program to auto-backup the saves so I could cheat permadeath when I wanted to. I have played many dungeon crawl games, including Rogue, the OG of the genre. Out of them, this is one of the best.\n\nA large open world (for the genre) full of quests and NPCs. There is plenty to do and see in ADOM as well as a large selection of Class/Race combanations. The mechanics are perfect. This game was created based on PnP rpgs like DnD, and attempts to recreate this as much as possible. There are a ton of hidden rolls, and many are refrenced in the text. The text really makes it feel like a tabletop rpg, well written and really sets the tone.\n\nADOM is also Random and unpredictable. You may die on the way to your first town, killed by enemies you stood no chance against, or kick down a door  to find a large demon ready to rip your head off. With permadeath on it is a hardcore dungeon delvers wet dream come true. This game is hard.\n\nBut now there are options to turn certain features, like permadeath, off. This opens the door for people like me, who enjoy the style, but dont like always playing a hardcore character. It also makes it easier to really enjoy the story and world without fear of losing your character . The graphics are not cutting edge, and I for one am glad. This is the update the game needed. Havent fiddled with the other game modes, but I theres just so much to do. I am also glad development seems to be continueing, so there may be more content to come.\n\nSo there you go, I love this game, totally worth my money.  If you are into old skool Rogue-Likes and value depth over fancy graphics I think you will too.\n\n\n\nps~Thank you Thomas, for all the hours I have played your game over the years, I bought this almost as soon as it came out on steam, and you deserve every penny.

I haven't played this game before it came out on steam, so I'm not really blinded by nostalgia goggles. But this game is good, only it's the toughest learning curve I've ever experienced, even harder than X-Com Long war mod. To those expecting to play something where it's possible to win as long as you play right, turn away. However for those willing to preservere through tens and eventually hundreds of character deaths this game is rewarding. It's sort of like crossing a minefield, where the signs are all in a different language, so you don't know where the mines are or what to do. And take my advice, the tutorial isn't that good, it's better to wiki everything, unless you are really really masochistic and wanna learn everything through dying.\n\nBut once you learn the tricks of the game, it's enormously fun. For example, I kept starving to death, because I didn't realize you could eat corpses and nobody minds. No karma lashbacks, and no getting sick, unless you eat something poisonous. Then I finally got past the third dungeon. That's right, I've died multiple times and still hadn't gotten past that third beginner dungeon. Then I made the mistake of wandering into a random dungeon and getting killed by a room full of giants.\n\nAnyways the perks of this game are:\n1 it's very difficult, sort of like demon souls.\n2. It's a delight for people who like to imagine what the fights look like instead of seeing it. Like when I accidentally wandered into a water trap with a fluff ball in my backpack and gremlins started appearing out of nowhere. I was like "Oh, ****" and they constantly multiplied around my Monk character. Hundreds of dead gremlins later, the floor was flooded with blood and my monk had came through unscathed.\n3. There are many, many, many different ways to play the game. You could be the unarmed monk,(my favorite), the untouchable wizard(too frail in melee for my tastes), or the cunning assassin(kept dying, cuz he doesn't start with heal) and much much more. Apparently there's a race that starts with the spit acid ability or something.\n\nOh well, this reviews getting a bit too long. In short, this is a good game for those willing to put up with how hard core it is and are willing to put up with the ridiculous key mappings.","December 14, 2015","true","47.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

From the very begining of character generation you have to adapt to what star sign you are born under, allocating certain abilities.  Do you still make that thief? Or do you change up your character strategy to better fit your star sign?\n\nThe loot is the best though.  Do you try on that better piece of armor because you've been getting slaughtered, knowing that it could be cursed, or do you hold out for an altar or identify scroll?\n\nI haven't made it past level 11, and I keep coming back for more.\n\nIf you enjoy rogue-likes, then this is all you will need.

As far as graphics are concerned, it comes down to a matter of personal taste. I happen to love them, but if you don't, you can always play in ASCII mode. Either way, don't let the graphics deter you from playing this game. It's so much deeper than that. There's a reason why this game is still being played 20 years after it's release. It has nothing to do with graphics. The UI is totally fine, and has seen major improvement over the recent months. Yes, there are a lot of commands to remember, but again that just speaks to the depth of the game. The learning curve of this game is steep, but rewarding and totally worth it. There's a free version of the game on the ADOM website if you're on the fence or you can't fork out the money for it. Go try it out.

I was stunned that you really needed almost the whole keyboard to play the game and it sure took time to learn most of the quirks. Back then the game was presented in ASCII aka by symbols like letters and numbers. Plain 'g' for goblin and 'k' for kobold.\n\nThis new Steam version has graphics in form of a tileset tho, so you don't have to learn how to "read" the game first even though it doesn't remove the fact that you still have to master them buttons. I think the tileset is very decent taking concideration the scale of the game and the amount of classes/races/weapons/etc there is.\n\nThe UI sure feels clunky though and I recomend taking your time to read through everything the first time. After generating few characters and painfully losing them you'll surely get the hang of it and the gameplay get's much smoother and faster. It's not as difficult as Dwarf Fortress but in a whole new level compared to i.e. Dungeons of Dredmor if that helps anything.\n\nI might add and edit the review if needed but for now I just wanted to welcome my old friend to Steam and give it a nice 9/10 review.","November 16, 2015","true","21.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Buy food if you didn't start with much, and especially have food for long treks through the wilderness. Anyone can put a madman out of his misery - a true hero will find a way to heal him. Giant inscects have hard shells, and you may need to swing like a berserker to cut through. Your first mindcrafter will be killed by a stone block; do not be angry when this happens.

I was stunned that you really needed almost the whole keyboard to play the game and it sure took time to learn most of the quirks. Back then the game was presented in ASCII aka by symbols like letters and numbers. Plain 'g' for goblin and 'k' for kobold.\n\nThis new Steam version has graphics in form of a tileset tho, so you don't have to learn how to "read" the game first even though it doesn't remove the fact that you still have to master them buttons. I think the tileset is very decent taking concideration the scale of the game and the amount of classes/races/weapons/etc there is.\n\nThe UI sure feels clunky though and I recomend taking your time to read through everything the first time. After generating few characters and painfully losing them you'll surely get the hang of it and the gameplay get's much smoother and faster. It's not as difficult as Dwarf Fortress but in a whole new level compared to i.e. Dungeons of Dredmor if that helps anything.\n\nI might add and edit the review if needed but for now I just wanted to welcome my old friend to Steam and give it a nice 9/10 review.","November 16, 2015","true","21.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

But be warned, it is not a simple game where you will sit down for five minutes to flick birds at stuff. This game requires time and patience of you, but it gives back as much as you give.\n\nFor new players, a few tips: you have a deity, and you should pray when things get tough. Buy food if you didn't start with much, and especially have food for long treks through the wilderness. Anyone can put a madman out of his misery - a true hero will find a way to heal him. Giant inscects have hard shells, and you may need to swing like a berserker to cut through. Your first mindcrafter will be killed by a stone block; do not be angry when this happens. Until you understand how altars work, do not step on black ones.\n\nAnd keep at it. Yes, you will die a lot. Expect your high scores to fill up with level 1-7 heroes before you really start to master this game. Winning this game is not an eventual certainty. It is a glorious achievement.\n\nAxes high!","November 17, 2015","true","78.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you haven't played many "classics" like baldur's gate, icewind dale ect. You will maybe feel a bit alienated on the D&D based mechanics. None the less, once you understand the system it is very logical and mathematic.\n\nAnyone who has played a decent amount of RTS games or MMORPG's will not have a hard time learning and memorising the different keys used to play the game. There are quite a few different commands and key combinations, it can seem intimidating at first. Honestly, there's only about 10-15 commands you will actually use early game. You learn everything fluently as you play by occasionally going into the help menu for key bindings.\n\nThe game is quite unforgiving and does require a lot of trial and error. It will teach you to be careful and methodical. Also with the perma-death feature, you will have to learn how to leg it. All in all I feel the game is very fair. There are occasional frustrating deaths like getting critical hit by a rat who you thought was absolutely no threat but most of the time it is your own fault if you died.\n\nI would definately recommend this game to anyone who love's very indepth and challenging RPGs.\n\n","January 17","true","50.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its one of those "two-and-a-half to three stars' moments.\n\nNow I have to explain that I'm one of those people who were playing ADOM since early-days. I spent countless hours and spent dozens on dozens of characters to their eventual deaths. And that is something you have to get used to in this game. Your characters die. When they die, they're gone for good. Shiny gear. Nifty abilities. Everything. Gone. The only thing you'll have to remember them by is their entry on your personal high score board reminding you that your best character died on level 5 of some hole in the field because he/she died of the black plague because you ate a kobold corpse on the ground.\n\nI'm resisting the urge to ramble on and on here. ADOM really is a good game! Its wonderfully complex yet simple in its premise. There is no real story involved. 'Go and fight Chaos'. They drop you on the world and wish you good luck. The overworld is always the same. And the dungeons you dive into are always random. But this time, instead of the ASCII characters representing yourself, enemies, and items on the ground, you have a nifty little graphical representation. And in the 'old' game, you had to memorize a LOT of hotkeys, as combinations of letters with alt/shift/ctrl were what you had to press to perform actions and bring up menus.\n\nBut that's the rub. The GUI (that's Graphical User Inferface), in my opinion, is about 75% of what you're buying here. Yes, there are a few different modes you can play in. Yes, you can now play by using the mouse and right-clicking to bring up a menu of things you can do instead of remembering its keystroke to make it more forgiving for newbies learning how to get around - though the game itself can still be brutal. But when you get down to brass tacks, you're buying cosmetics.\n\nThat's why I wavered on the tumbs up and tumbs down. I love ADOM. It's a relic from junior high through college for me. But are you willing to drop more than $10 for what adds up to little more than polish? I did, for the nostaliga. But it might be a touch stiff for others when they could have gotten the original ADOM for free in the past.","November 17, 2015","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you are a new player, I'd steer away from it or, at least, try a free version which is obtainable from Mr Biskup's site.\n\nThere are better roguelikes (like: true roguelikes, not rogue-lites and whatnot) out there, that are more fun and much more forgiving more newcomers.

This review is coming from someone who has not played the original games in the series and has no prior knowledge, and from someone who didn’t grow up playing this type of game either. Please bear that in mind with this review.\n\nGameplay is like any other roguelike game, where you get to choose from an array of different characters, and develop levels, statistics and skills as you progress.  The game is played from a top down angel and is very heavily weighted towards stats and what choices you make in whether you succeed or fail.  The game’s tutorial absolutely bombards you with way too much information which personally left more confused compared to when I first started. The controls and UI are quite possibly the worst I have ever experienced in a game too. There is quite literally a different button for every single mechanic in the game. This game made me feel sufficiently stupid because of how much jumble there is on any one screen at any time. The game was telling me to use buttons that I don’t think I have ever used on this keyboard. I am surprised this is one of the most popular roguelikes ever just from going off the usability of the game thus far.\n\nThe graphics are bad, there is no way around it and anyone who says otherwise is purely saying it from a nostalgia standpoint.  The pictures in the screen shots are definitely not what the game looks like on my screen, and I was playing the game in 4k.\n\nI am still stuck in the tutorial of the game, because of being dumbfounded with the controls and the amount of information being thrown at me but this game if you manage to get into it, will offer you hours and hours of content with a very high replay ability factor also being the main reason behind this.\n\nI am fully expecting this review to not be very popular given that I have reviewed it before even getting out of the tutorial; and I am clearly missing something about this game since it is so highly rated. But for me, having not grown up playing this type of game, and from someone who is not able to take in abundant amounts of information and learning the most whacky confusing control scheme, I simply cannot recommend it. It is possibly a generation thing, but if you mostly agree with my reviews and enjoy the same games I do, then you may want to eerie on the side of caution when trying this out as it is simply a game I did not enjoy at all.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n----\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

First, basic computer program sequences didn't work. For example, I couldn't figure out how to quit out of the game and the standard Command-Q and menu items did nothing. I eventually pulled up the "Force Quit" menu and killed the program that way (equivalent to kill -9 for Unix users). Second, the fonts and window don't scale properly, and there are about 37,000 settings for these things, none of which produce a nice, usable look and feel on fonts unless you leave the window a tiny thing on the screen. On a 2560x1440 or 1920x1080 screen it is just insanely silly. Third, the tutorial is more annoying than helpful. It randomly pops up a super-small text box that is ridiculously difficult to scroll through telling you things that are generally irrelevant at the time. Sure, it's a roguelike and so there are tons of commands, but at least list them for me in some sort of importance order on the side of the screen or something.\n\nAll in all, I've been playing Roguelikes since, literally, Rogue in the 80s and this was one of the worst experiences ever. I returned the program to Steam and downloaded the free one. I've spent a few hours with the free one and found no way around any of these problems above. If you want a truly great Roguelike to buy here on Steam, look at ToME instead.

The controls are completely user unfriendly, pointedly so. I know complex and user unfriendly controls are part and parcel of this style of game.

There is a small list of reasons, but it comes down to the fact that the game just isn't much fun.  Perhaps that's a symptom of being 'roguelike', perhaps not.\n\nPros\n- easy to get started, play a while and then stop.  ei no load times, no startup ads to watch, no fancy graphic splash screen\n\nCons\n-  Vast majority of games end in you dying.  Since this is permadeath all the time invested is lost.  Period.\n- Most of the things that kill young characters (hunger, traps you can't detect on doors you must go through), poisons you can't cure, monsters that one-hit-kill and who are also faster than you are) you have no possibility of avoiding.  The game doesn't attempt to balance things, it mostly just rolls RNG's and eventually you die.\n- Your character rarely knows anything about the equipment/potion/buffs.  You could die with a potion of healing in your possession and have no possibility of finding out.\n- Even if you choose a class that allows you to see cursed/uncursed status, the game has undetectable cursed items to saddle your character with usless sh*t.\n- Game does a very poor job at allowing balanced characters.\n- Too many things completely invulnerable to player attacks/spells, and very little chance to determine what could be effective against them before you die.\n- If you need something (food particularly, healing, a decent weapon, an identify scroll) you will never find it.  If you don't need it, the stuff drops like rain.  And of course this lack is going to kill you.\n\nPretty much the game is more of a fancy RNG, rather that someting that is fun.   Some will find this fun, most people will find it frustrating and unrewarding.  And the fact that it kills you repeatedly without any possibilty of not dying makes it more fruitless.","November 27, 2015","false","69.1"," 14 of 55 people (25%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","25","14","55","13","4"

The learning curve requires a lot of reading, and even character creation requires a lot of reading.   Everything you do requires reading basically.  The combat system is pretty basic and simple, despite a proclaimed deep tactical system in the description.  The controls are overly complex to the point of being unnecessarily complex and having different unique key strokes and key combinations for everything you can do, to the point where you barely remember how to navigate your inventory.\n\nI could see this game being enriching and deep if you are into a lot of reading, a big learning curve, using primarily keyboard commands for everything, and a lot of figuring everything out for yourself or reading tons of help menus.  It's not that I am opposed to text-based RPGs, it is just not what was advertised, and I was expecting a lot more action-packed adventure.","November 18, 2015","false","1.4"," 10 of 47 people (21%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","21","10","47","3","0"

When I select my character by clicking him, the menu won't pop up, and I will be stuck.  Have to hard reset the game to restart the game.  I've had to hard reset like over a dozen times, and since it is a 'roguelike' game there is no save of my character, and a self save takes me back to the main screen (annoying).\n\nFun game though w/ tons of characters and classes to play.  Pretty basic like other games like Hammerwatch imo, w/o multiplayer which is a shame.  Typical hack in slash that is strongly keyboard based though.  Game is probably slightly overpriced, and worth probably in the 9.99 for the basic overall quality of the game (there really is no soundtrack for example).\n\nWhat is cool, is you get to play a combo of tons of races and classes (that should be more previlent in more fantasy genre games like this one), but are not.  For instance I love playing a Troll Barbarian.\n\nThis game I guess is a bit old there are some indie strat guides out there to help you select your character and to explain stuff (like selling stuff requires you to go into the merchant shop and drop the item on the shop floor, lol weird), and in that regard, the game seems overall unpolished compared to the price point which it is at imo.\n\n----\n\nAfter playing more hours and seeing the dev reply to the game, let me expand my review some more.\n\nThis is the typical game that falls into "challenging" and tries to prey on perhaps the nostalgic feelings of those who maybe played this game in the past.\n\nGranted I like challenging games, but realistically you will get 3-7 hours of frustrating fun.\n\nI found it extremely difficult to get past the southern dungeon on my way past the map.\n\nAll dungeon maps are always rectangular in nature, vary very little; granted they seem to be using a random seed of some kind, but after 3-4 times it gets stale.  There are torches on the wall, other than that, there is no decor.  Character animations are limited and are only left face and right face.  Also when I equip certain equipment like the helm it is barely visible or not visible at all.\n\nThere is no soundtrack, the ambience sound is almost non-existent.  Occasionally I hear the drop of into a puddle in a dungeon.  Again, the atmosphere of the game feels incomplete.\n\nThere are TONS of games similar to this, Gauntlet $19.99 (when not on sale, 2015 game) (http://store.steampowered.com/app/258970/ ) is a popular game my friends play that has a multiplayer aspect, which this game does not have.  Also Hammerwatch $9.99 (not on sale) which does exist, unlike what the Dev has said and exists here on Steam:  http://store.steampowered.com/app/239070/\n\n\nLet me describe a small experience I had playing a Troll Barbarian, which granted is pretty cool since most games fall short of providing the race/class combo which games like this should have (orignally stated above).  I roll this toon, spec into two handed weapons, and I go into the trial dungeon, first door is locked, I can only kick it down, in the process of kicking the door down my huge club is broke, lol wtf ok.  So basically your skill that you used to get the 2hed item is worthless and now you have to punch guys.\nOverall sound effects are stale, limited, and lackluster, and could be improved dramatically.\nIf you are going to bring back a game from 1995 update date, improve it a ton.  Check out Divinity Original Sin (http://store.steampowered.com/app/373420/), a game which was just enhanced w/ over 90+ hours of gameplay and fully AAA voiced acted.\nSpell casters feel bulky and there is not hotkey menu like modern games have (again you are paying for a 1995 1st addition D&D type game).  I have to constantly hit he escape menu to break away from the immersion of the game to open a spellbook.  After some casting of the spells they are "forgotton" (no tutorial on this at all btw, to explain this to first time players of ADOM like myself), and I have to relearn them.  Which means you have to worry about carrying 100 stone tombs everywhere you go.  This is a problem if you play a gnome mage (which I tried out), and tried carrying around 5 tombs plus heavy rations.\nCertain classes have to eat CONSTANTLY like the game should be renamed “iron ration buffet” as trolls have to eat 1-2 every dungeon level.  Since food weighs a TON certain races are bogged down w/ carrying capacity issues (which only mildly exists as a nuisance in other games).\n\nOn the flip side I like rolling a quick character and just smashing through enemies in the dungeons.  But other games have this pleasure of smashing AI units into the ground.\nAlso initial encounters past the first town can kill you very easily.  You see the theme here?  This game has a HUGE learning curve w/ 8bit graphics.  Time/reward/money do not align that well.\n\nWhy are the rations so heavy in this game? And not proportion to the character size, again another design flaw.\n\nThis game is geared towards probably ppl who are in the 30s.  Why pay for this game when you can get far superior games for roughly 1-2x the price.  Although if you want to step into a time machine and try to play and relive the sweet memories when you were 8 years old on your Commodore.\n\nI feel like this game is a semi money grab at the nostalgic feels of old time gamers who played this game and who want to shell out $ for these feels.\n\nAfter being frustrated for the last time, I uninstalled.\n\nFunny, when a long time bud on Steam who saw me playing this game on messaged me:\n\n"2015 >> azbolg still playing ♥♥♥♥ games"\n\nThis game is a solid 4 / 10.","November 16, 2015","false","11.8"," 9 of 97 people (9%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","9","9","97","11","14"
