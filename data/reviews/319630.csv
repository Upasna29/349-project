I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror. And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute.\nWhen I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it. I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag. It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning. I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined. Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless. Imagine if games held this standard. Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution.\nYou can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way. The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it.\n\nMost adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games.\nI've never felt so fulfilled after "playing a game" as I did today. Original, beautiful and masterfully executed. I can't wait for the next episode.","March 5, 2015","true","22.2"," 3,683 of 3,865 people (95%) found this review helpful 118 people found this review funny","95","683","3","118","63"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goddessv/recommended/319630/","goddessv","VenuS ♡","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goddessv/","188 products in account","This game deserves a love letter, not a review. So here it goes..\n\nDear Lis,\n\nEver since you showed up, you’ve caught everyone’s attention. Although not mine, at least not until I kept hearing your name and seeing your pictures everywhere. Everyone talking about your beauty, perfection, mystery and how interesting you were. Boys and girls, all were in love with Lis. Which made me very intrigued. So I watched you closely but I kept a distance, because you were not even my type. I can’t deny it, sometimes I was attracted to you and wanted to approach you. But sadly I didn’t have money on me, so I couldn’t. So I accepted fate, and kept my distance.\n\nUntil one day, I had enough money. But I wasn’t sure anymore if I wanted you or not. I wasn’t sure if you would even notice me among all these 75 million users. I was just a nobody. I thought of other options, but for some reason, my heart preferred you. I don’t know why or what it was. But I knew you were the one. Among thousands of other choices, I chose you Lis... I think it was destiny. Do you believe in destiny Lis?\n\nI still remember our first date. I waited for you for so long. Was a bad internet day. Then you finally came. I‘ve never been so excited to see someone this much before. And for some reason, something about you moved me. I felt this incredible strong connection between us. I felt ridiculously relaxed, comfortable, confident and very interested in you. We started getting to know each other, and you kept me even more and more interested in you. The date ended fast, even though it wasn’t really. It’s just that you made time travel faster than light. I hated it when you had to go. You promised me of another date, and that’s what kept me going.\n\nThe date was there, you looked even more beautiful than ever. Was another perfect day we had together. Until you touched me in a way, I couldn’t understand or know what to feel or think. Caught me off guard, surprised me. It was.. so good! Too good! But sadly you had to go. You left and left me with this fire burning inside me. So many questions, mixed emotions.. I didn’t know what was happening to me! So many questions going through my head. I wanted answers but I had to wait for the next time I see you. I was quiet the whole time, listening to you, melting with you, flying with you. You even brought tears into my eyes. It was a flawless experience. All my worries faded away and I was happy again. Then it was your time to leave, again.. but before you did, you rocked my world!! You left me again with all these emotions and questions. What were you doing to me Lis!!? These feelings, never felt anything like them before, ever! What happened on our last meeting has been on my mind since you left. You were all I could think of. Waiting for our next meeting was the most intense feeling and important thing in my life at that point. But you were late Lis.. again.. I was scared, afraid that you changed your mind about me. That, you didn’t want me anymore. Until one day you said, October 20th you’ll be there. I smiled so wide until you said it was going to be our last time. It crushed me. Flipped my whole world upside down. I didn’t feel like doing anything anymore. You kept me up everynight. I’d roll over again and again. Hearing your name and seeing your pictures in my head. Remembering the things you made me feel. I had hopes that I might be able to change your mind and make you stay.\n\nOctober 20th came. I was both excited and scared. I couldn’t see you. I’m so sorry Lis, I avoided you, stayed away from the feed. It hurt but I had to. Everyone was still talking about you, but it was only making me more furious.. But I knew I couldn’t hide from you forever, besides you were leaving me for good. So I needed to at least say goodbye.\n\nOctober 21st. Which is today.. I waited for you. Again was another bad internet day. Then you showed up. My heart was beating so fast I almost fainted. I was so happy to see you again after so long, but at the same time, all those questions and emotions came back all at once. I wasn’t ready for it. It kept messing with my head the whole time. Taking me on this roller coaster of heightened emotions. Unanswered questions. You were vague yourself. You drove me crazy Lis. I had no clue what was happening. I was losing my mind and pulling my hair out. I was both scared and sad and happy and all at once. You’re doing it to me again Lis. Then when it was time for you to go, you just.. made me make the hardest decision of my life. I literally froze for 10 minutes. I didn’t know what to choose. I cared so much, it was so hard for me choose. But it didn’t matter after all, because whatever decision I was going to make, it wasn’t going to make you stay. So I chose. Tears started falling down one by one at the last sight of your beauty. The last time I hear your heavenly voice. The last time we laugh together, explore together, get mad together, get scared together, see the world together, and be happy… together…\n\nWhy Lis! How could you do this! I thought you were the one. I opened myself to you. We been through so much together! We changed past, present and future together! We created wonders! Put smiles on people’s faces! We made magic. It was all perfect. Then you just left me alone, sobbing, crying, screaming and bleeding love for you.\n\nWhat I’m trying to say is that, I’m sitting here right now, writing this letter for you in my Asylum cell where I’m getting treated from the mind ♥♥♥♥s and emotions you put me through, that all the choices we made, all the memes we made, all the ships we fought for, all the music we heard, secrets we discovered, emotions we felt, tears we shed... will all remain. They will always stay dear in my heart and I will always love you...\n\nYours truly.\nVenus","October 21, 2015","true","25.6"," 2,385 of 2,636 people (90%) found this review helpful 848 people found this review funny","90","385","2","848","86"

I'm glad to say that this has been addressed and I have to give the devs kudos for that. Now fans and newcomers alike will be able to enjoy this game even more.\n\nThis game will obviously not be for everyone but I do think it appeals to a lot of people (as seen by the Steam user reviews). It's quite simply a high school drama with a bit of mystery and the supernatural thrown in. If you had thought it was some feministic sort of game like I had initially --  I urge you to give this game another look. I have tried to be as honest as I can about a game which I have thoroughly enjoyed and I hope this review has helped you, the reader, in some way. For $20 I highly recommend grabbing Life Is Strange and if you don't happen to enjoy it in the first hour or so: refund it. I don't think you will though :) It honestly deserves a 8.5/10 in my book.","October 20, 2015","true","29.1"," 336 of 375 people (90%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","90","336","375","9","47"

I was delighted. The Bundle had several games, such as Murdered: Soul Suspect, The Last Remnant, 3 Tomb Raiders, and the first episode for this game called Life is Strange.\nNot gonna lie I've been trying to get my hands on this game for a while but I always ended up buying other games (oh, I wish I could go back in time to buy Life is Strange, instead of those games).\n\nDecember 24, 2015\nOh, What the hell!? I'm gonna buy the rest of the episodes for Life is Strange. I don't care, it's Christmas Eve. It's a little gift from me to myself. I can't wait for the Holidays to pass so I can finally start to play this game.\n\nDecember 25, 2015\nAlright, the time has come. The time to start this epic journey, hopefully, alongside with Max and Chloe.\nIt's been so long since I first saw this game on the store, and yet I don't really know what to expect from this game. Like at all. I don't know what the story is about. Time to play it, finally!\n\nDecember 26, 2015\nToday I played the first and the second episode of Life is Strange, and oh man, now I really wish I would have bought this game earlier, instead of all those other games. The story just started and I already feel such a strong connection to the characters. I don't think that any other game made me feel like this. Better continue this story, I'm so intrigued about what's gonna happen next. Can't wait to play it.\nP.S.: Always go with Eggs and Bacon!\n\nDecember 27, 2015\nHoly Crap.. This game is getting tougher and tougher, emotionally speaking. What the hell is going on?\nToday I only could finish the 3rd Episode, and I can ensure you this is getting darker and darker.\nI'm at the point where the decisions are getting harder and they start to have a great weight on the story.\nAlthough I know Max can fix this situation, that ending just left me heartbroken.\nI haven't even finished the game yet and I can't stop thinking about it. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it.\n\nDecember 28, 2015\nI lacked courage and strenght to go through these last episodes, call me whatever you want, but this game took a toll on me. When I finally did it, I can say that I have never felt like this before. I think the correct word is desolated, yeah, I feel desolated.\nThe story is absolutely beautiful, it has many twists, and the characters are so well developed that you can easily create special bonds with almost everyone. Graphically the game is beautiful as well, take your time to appreciate the little details.\nObviously I will not spoil you, but be aware, this game has no good ending. It has a bad ending and a worse ending.\nI took the ending, that I consider to be the bad ending (morally speaking), and it doesn't make me feel that bad.\nAfterall, friends are for life, right?\n\nDecember 30, 2015\nTwo days have passed since I finished the game, and I still can't stop thinking about it.\nSometimes I find myself reading Max's diary, and looking at screenshots and artwork of the game.\nI have to play it a second time to complete it, but it's still to soon, I have to recover first. I can't make Max go through all that again.\nI had no idea that a game could make such impact on a person. This is one of my favorite games and I recommend everyone to play it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joergklopsch/recommended/319630/","joergklopsch","Torque","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joergklopsch/","586 products in account","Update: German translation of this review + german sub patches and tipps for the locations of all ten optional photos can be found here[www.jkl-solutions.de]!\n\nShort Introducing:\nToday I bought a keen game from a third party store for steam. It is the game: Life Is Strange™. It got my attention tonight and the great graphic with the Videofilm gameplay convinced me to get this game for my gaming collection, especially because I like this kind of games. The Wing commander series or Another world, who had as we all now a different and way older graphic than this artwork.\n\nBUGS:\nUnfortunately there are a few none game breaking bugs. The last update (30.01.2015) deactivated the steam overlay and now people are not able to take in game screenshoots which is really bad, since the female protagonist loves to take selfies or photos from other things.\n\nFor me it sounds like a great deal, to "Make a photo and put in on facebook" right now it's just "sorry not available". The next problem is the controller support. The rumble-feature is active but not working and the Camera angle goes crazy while the controller is put in. So all you can do is unplug your controller and stop the camera madness around your female avatar. I had the same problem with Lilly's Adventure, the camera guidance was terrible there. But lucky me, the bug only occurs when the controller is plugged in. The Adventure started with Keyboard and Mouse, how every good adventure starts.\n\nEven more BUGS:\nStill steam overlay related bug but very annoying, you can't when or what achievement you unlocked. They still work (I have 2 right now) but I like to see when I unlock a new achievement. The developer are aweare of these problems and are working on an upcoming patch to fix this problem.\n\nThe Language:\nThere is no German language at the moment neither is there any subtitle in German for this game. This causes some problem for people with an average school English to understand everything. Don't get me wrong, the language is still understandable and enjoyable even with low English comprehension for Germans. The good news here is, the developer showed a launch trailer on Youtube where you can see German subtitles, also there is the community who is working on a German language pack and its already 75% done. I have provided my site GrabFreeGames.net  to upload the data there and let everyone download it from there. Maybe they will accept it and then everyone could download the file via a steam guide, until the steam workshop will be activated for this masterpiece. Cleoe Price voice doesn't fit for a 18 year old teenager, for me she sounds more like a 25 year old grown up.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa7_V-xHz7g\nGerman Let's plays:\nEven the good old Gronkh, Germans famous Let's Player started to make a lets play about this great game and he was allowed to play the game on 26.01. You have to be Gronkh be able to play games this early :)\n\nHere are the first 5 episodes he made, as a german should watch this and listen to the amazing soundtrack. It's a joy for your ears (Gronkh also loves it and plays it till the end in episode two)\n\nLIFE IS STRANGE [001] - Tagträume ? Let's Play Life is Strange\nLIFE IS STRANGE [002] - Butterfly Effect ★ Let's Play Life is Strange\nLIFE IS STRANGE [003] - Campusleben ★ Let's Play Life is Strange\nLIFE IS STRANGE [004] - Nichts scheint, wie es ist ★ Let's Play Life is Strange\nLIFE IS STRANGE [005] - Komm auf meine Bude ★ Let’s Play Life is Strange\n\nNow we are at the end of my detailed review for Life Is Strange™. When you are not going to watch the 5 episodes from Gronkh watch at least the trailer and see what big visual impact it has and listen to the awesome music. I can not wait  und  to play the other 4 upcoming episodes that will come out in the way Telltale used to do in their adventure games. The release date for episode 2 is planet for march 2015.\n\nConclusion:\nBeside the bugs, that should not really matter these kind of things happen on a new released game the only downgrade here is the missing facial expressions and the lack of challenge. The Audiovisual demonstration and the good story are good enough to let you forget about the minor bugs and enjoy the game. I hope you liked my review and I would be happy getting a like from you when it helped you to decide to buy or not buy the game.\n\nPersonal Rating:\nStory: 18/20\nGameplay: 17/20\nGraphics: 18/20\nMusic: 20/20\nPersonal Like: 19/20\n-------------------------------------------------------\nGeneral: 92/100\n\nI'm in love with this game, every fan of good adventure should buy this game or put it on the wishlist to buy it once every episode is out.","February 2, 2015","true","51.5"," 394 of 476 people (83%) found this review helpful 62 people found this review funny","83","394","476","62","45"

I was branded by their upbeat forum denizens as a lesbian man-hating misandrist sexually abused by her father before I even got the game, and I presumed that as such I could only experience ultimate joy in its feminazi power fantasy.\n\nThis game... surprised me, however. It featured a touching, inspired storyline with many realistic and fully developed characters, with a lighthearted and calming atmosphere. Life Is Strange features beautiful graphics and tranquil scenery, accompanied by unique game play, marked with an unusual and innovative method of progressing through the game.\n\nThe female supremacy, however, was decidedly lacking. There was no crushing men beneath the steel toes of my combat boots, no oppressing men with laughter, no delight at causing sorrow with vicious malice and violence; there was not even any intrusion into men's safe spaces in the sciences with our exploitation of our gender, no being selfish and narcissistic queens of white knights, or whatever we're apparently doing these days. Instead of wearing the skins of slain men, greedily drinking their tears, and reveling in their screams of pain, I was captivated by its beauty and fascinating story. Even later I witnessed a man who was emotionally troubled, and only experienced concern and worry, and when I saw him cry, I felt no joy, only emptiness.\n\n8.5/10 as a video game, 0/10 as a feminazi power trip","February 25, 2015","true","15.1"," 1,148 of 1,501 people (76%) found this review helpful 707 people found this review funny","76","148","1","707","59"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/messofanego/recommended/319630/","messofanego","Messofanego","http://steamcommunity.com/id/messofanego/","259 products in account","It is like the best bits of Alan Wake, Dreamfall Chapters, and Walking Dead on top of an engrossing time travel high school back-to-home-town coming of age mystery drama.\n\nThere might have been only one episode released so far, but damn is it impressively substantial that I felt I got a whole indie movie's worth of character development and progress out of it. While you navigate through Max's journey of figuring out her career in photography, there are also other characters' stories from big to small. Not to mention Max turning around her shy introspective worldview into more of a "Blackwell Ninja" which is achieved thanks to the acquirement of a time rewind superpower. The archetypes of the jocks, mean girls, burnouts, and mystery drama are there but the characters are given enough depth that you don't feel too one-sided towards anyone where it'd make the major choices easier. The girls might mention which boys they like or gossip around but that isn't their only traits on offer compared to the relatively simple male characters. An example is the mean girls queen, Victoria along with her two cronies is blocking your path to the dorms so you can use time manipulation to eventually spill paint all over Victoria. You can either take a picture of her to shame her even more but she feels genuinely sad or you could take this chance to befriend her. The game's all about breaking the surface to figure out what makes each character tick. All this small-scale high school drama eventually leads to the other main character, Chloe, coming into the picture with her own drug-and-money conflict that involves clues to what happened to cause Rachel Amber's missing.\n\nWhile sometimes the time manipulation can feel trial-and-error in that you wouldn't have noticed that you could place a piece of cardboard beforehand under a shelf to catch some screwdrivers when you shake a table, for the most part it teaches you well that any big task should be thought of a few steps in advance. Even if you fail, there is very little frustration as you can rewind as much as you want to get the desired result. The game isn't very challenging in that sense, but in such a narrative-heavy game you don't want the puzzles to be a nuisance and want to encourage the player to experiment around with the rewind mechanic especially as they're in service of furthering relationships with characters.\n\nThe best part of it being a videogame is being able to bask in the world of a high school with the tiniest of details that you'd expect out of point-and-click adventures but in 3D like the Dreamfall games. Max comments on nearly everything that you'd expect, so it's definitely a game where you want to glean as much monologue as possible. While I would have liked a bit more control in some of the moments in the form of possible minigames like taking photos Beyond Good and Evil-style or actually flying a drone around outside the school, these more contemplative repeatable moments such as sitting on the fountain or playing the guitar that harken to the relaxing in Brothers A Tale of Two Sons are still appreciated. The music is memorable and thematically on-point while the end of summer colour palette and art direction is incredibly welcoming on the eyes.\n\nA couple of flaws deserve mention. The first being the bad lip syncing although it's understandable given how much dialogue there is and the team size. The second being how many of the dialogue choices railroad to the same response. The time rewind choices though are quite substantial and some even have consequences visible in this first episode.\n\nIf a relatively relaxed and heart-warming coming of age interactive tale with some time travel is up your alley, don't miss out on this special experience.","January 29, 2015","true","11.7"," 252 of 326 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","252","326","8","13"

It’s probably my favorite genre, overall.\n\nWhy is that important? Because I have to scramble my brain to find any other examples of games that has captivated me so consistently and felt as evocative and powerful as Life is Strange. I can’t even pinpoint why, not exactly anyway. There’s plenty of weak points here, after all. The graphics are nothing to gawp at. The lip-synching is just awful. The story is interesting, but nothing stellar. Not to mention the puzzles, which are not challenging or even very creative. But I find myself ignoring all of that while playing, because the game just sucks me in. It’s one of those rare games that continue to affect me hours after I’ve completed an episode. It’s not just me thinking about how I could have affected the choice-driven story differently either. It’s more a sense of wonder. It makes me nostalgic. This game makes me think about my own life. It makes me think about memories I treasure, moments I remember from my youth. I find myself drifting back and forth in my muddled thoughts, thinking how my teenage years were and how they formed me. Life is Strange makes me feel. Not just while playing, but long afterwards. Life truly, is strange. It really makes that statement ring.\n\nLife is Strange then, is one of those games with heart. It shows its qualities primarily through its characters; flawed and occationally inconsistent, but so relatable, quirky and interesting. Every person has layers upon layers to them, and they all feel important, even when they do nothing at all but sit there. They feel real. And they keep surprising both me and Max, the sweet protagonist.\n\nThe other definitive quality of this game is in its atmosphere. Arcadia Bay, like the characters there, feels like a real place. You just want to explore this world! The visuals and the sounds and music comes together to create a gloriously  calm and warm symphony of lush forests, homey houses and run-down diners. It’s a place that seems to have been lost in time, a small American town that we all could feel some belonging to, no matter what nationality you adhere to. The most inspiring moments in this game comes from just walking and soaking it all in. Or sitting, while Max shares her thoughts with you. It feels precious. It really does.\n\nOh, and did I mention it’s got a sweet time-control mechanic?\n\nNow that’s just icing in the cake, though.\n","March 25, 2015","true","16.2"," 77 of 87 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","77","87","5","0"

After so much time, I finally dived into the universe of Life is Strange. After all the praise I’ve seen, and the huge fandom that seems to everywhere (which is hella understandable), I finally have played Life is Strange. Life is Strange is an episodic story-driven adventure which relies in your decisions to change certain story elements as you progress. This is a formula already known by Telltale games, but completely revamped and explored in a completely different, interesting way.\nAre you cereal?\n\nYou play as Maxine Caulfield, a photography nerd and not-so-popular student of Blackwell Academy. Blackwell is your stereotypical school portrayed in the movies and videogames, there’s the jockeys, the nerds, the cheerleaders and the usual bullying here and there. It all seems like a normal day, until our main character finds out she can manipulate time! This is how the game takes a completely different approach on decisions. You can always rewind and see what happens if you pick another line, or another action, giving you the opportunity to see most of the outcomes.\nI dare you to kiss me now.\n\nIf you’re not aware, Life is Strange is split into five episodes, each one of them carries the decisions you have made on the previous chapters. The first episode is the introduction to how the game plays. It shows the decision and time manipulation mechanics so you familiarize yourself with the controls. It also introduces the set of characters in the Life is Strange universe. By the end of the episode we meet Chloe Price, a so long forgotten friend of Max Caulfield. Your adventure only really begins when you step into that van. Since this is the first episode, it is by far the most light hearted in the saga. From here on there’s no way back, the roller coaster ain’t going back, except if you’re Mad Max and can rewind time. It has been YEARS since I’ve experienced so many emotions with a game, I think the last one that hit me this bad was Metal Gear Solid 4.\nYou finally came back to me this week, and... you did nothing but show me your love and friendship.\n\nThe voice acting in some sections is absolutely superb in every way. There’s one part that only the voice acting itself and the spoken lines are enough to sadden me into oblivion, this happens on the fourth episode, in the Junkyard. It’s a completely heartbreaking scene and really well done. Fact is, this game is not perfect in some aspects, but when you sacrifice certain aspects and polish the rest, that’s enough for me to overlook the flaws. As an example, the lip sync is not really good, but it doesn’t matter at all, when the voice acting is just so good and emotional.\nWhat kind of world does this?\n\nThe amount of references in this game really give it a unique feel and approach. It’s like Dontnod just felt like they had to squish a reference everywhere they could, and that’s amazing in my point of view. It makes the game more accessible and it becomes more familiar and easier to relate to. Maybe this is why we end up getting too emotionally obsessed with this game when it really turns for the worst.\nI hate that word… no offense.\n\nThe game looks great, it’s pretty unique, it’s like realistic but cartoonish at the same time. I also noticed how we have a game based on a character that’s so much into photography and art, and the developers give us a game full of beautiful scenarios for us to “photograph”. There’s certainly tons and tons of screenshot worthy moments in the game, waiting to be captured. It’s like most of the game is a golden hour itself.\nYour life is still yours to live.\n\nNot to mention, the soundtrack. This is totally not my type of music, it doesn’t fit my style that much, but this game has me hooked on most of the songs. Jonathan Morali did an outstanding job composing the tracks for Life is Strange, and the licensed music fits the mood of the game so well, especially when those really emotional moments really kick you in the gut, and now you keep remembering them because you’re addicted to the soundtrack. Yes, yes I am addicted too. The songs rely heavily on beautiful and simple acoustic sounds, mostly on guitar, it sets a great atmosphere in the game, such a quiet sound in such a dramatic storyline.\nLife is what happens while you're busy making other plans.\n\nI won’t lie, this game has everything I wanted. It’s beautiful. It has great music. It plays well with the time manipulation elements. It has amazing characters that you’ll find hard to let go. It has decisions that will make you pause the game and stop for a few minutes, because you really don’t know what to do. This game has a heart. A hella huge heart.\nI'm so glad you're my partner in crime.\nAs long as you're my partner in time.\n\nDontnod need all the praise I can give, and more of my money. Speaking of which, I did get this for free. My friend gave it to me, since he bought the Limited Edition after playing through the game. I’m going to do the same, because I want these developers to make more amazing experiences like this. I’ve said it like a thousand times, I hate you for gifting this to me, but it’s okay, I now feel your pain too, thanks again Singast.\nEdit (2016/05/25): Here it is! :D[i.imgur.com]\nReady for the mosh pit, shaka brah.\n\nIt’s unbelievably hard to express all of my feelings for this game. It’s a constant sledgehammer bundled with feelings hitting you in the back of the head every 15 minutes, they make sure that sledgehammer really takes the beating out off you. This game made me upset because of one ♥♥♥♥ing emoji. A simple emoji. Don’t even get me started on the endings, you’ll feel totally helpless and useless, so be ready, I was not. I ended up being selfish, so selfish. Then I saw the other ending, now I’ll never forget it for how gut-wrenching it was. (/;_;\)\nNO EMOJI\n\nMy past 5 days have been a constantly focused in Life is Strange. It is all I think about, it is all I listen to, it is all I have been playing. For 5 straight days, I was playing an episode per day, and it seemed like I was living in Arcadia Bay, I was there! And it’s an adventure that I’ll hardly forget.

In its totality, Life is Strange is an episodic game, yes. But each and every episode are strongly interconnected to present a majestic main story about life, about love, about cause and consequences. By the end of the Episode 2, I got the urge and raided my old DVD collection to find my copy of The Butterfly Effect. Fasten your seat belts: we are going to jump within time and possibilities!\n\nAs the first episode dawns, we meet Maxine "Max" Caulfield, an ordinary 18 year old girl with hobbies, dreams, insecurities and everyday worries; whose life will soon change drastically. Max is recently accepted to the prestigious Blackwell Academy to study photography, returning to her home town of Arcadia Bay 5 years after her family's moving to Seattle. As Max's dream comes true by her acceptance, she is yet unaware of the chain of events that she is about to set during a bathroom break. Talk about random, eh? Or is it? Within the timeframe of a week - and a relatively lot longer - Max will meet up with her childhood best friend, Chloe Price in the most unexpected of conditions and discover the shady part of Arcadia Bay more than she'd like to, as getting hold of some strange new powers. Is it fate? Or plain old probability? You decide as you play.\n\nLife is Strange is a story driven game with deep and elaborate narration, exceptionally realistic and relatable characters, beautiful environment and a majestic story. Aside the quality of graphics - which are spectacular - the environment is designed through the lenses of a photographer, suitable to our heroine's perception. The simplest of details are presented in a unique light and everything fills you up with simple emotions as you walk around in Arcadia Bay. Aside the story dynamics, you are always given opportunities of contemplation, when you can sit around and simply experience the mood and the feeling. On given dynamics; no, Life is Strange is anything but fast paced, but every step accumulates into one great experience.\n\nCharacters are alive and every day. You may most probably find yourself thinking of the girl next door while talking to one of class mates, or another old acquaintance that you know nothing about, yet would like to spare the time to know sometime. Arcadia Bay is weaved with thousands of anecdotes of our own lives: like old planks with child drawings on, fliers scattered in corridors and streets that no one seems to read, statues that reside on an avenue that no one would look twice aside the tourists or a couple of beer bottles thrown on a beach lot by the teenagers that partied there the other night. Life is Strange is fascinating because of its simplicity as also of its complication. It presents you the beauty of paradoxes everywhere as the life itself.\n\nThe elaboration of the cause and consequence: presenting the player a set of choices that will ultimately effect and alter the storyline has always been a favorite of game designers and gamers alike. Who wouldn't like to experience the element of choice in its all grandeur with the beauty of a fictional setting and/or without the lash back of real life conclusions? I know I would. In that sense: Life is Strange is one of the greatest projects that centers the theme of cause and consequence with an equilibrium between scientific explanations and metaphysical motifs weaved around the Chaos Theory. You are given choices - grand and little - in every step of your journey. Do they actually change anything? Now that is a question that would both present your common spoilers, and nullify the actual purpose of the game. For me, it wasn't the outcome of my choice that was important in this specific story. It was my character living with the choice that she's made as her choices either built or wrecked both her and many other lives around.\n\nI feel that I can keep babbling about this game forever; talking about science, relativity, metaphysics, mysticism, human condition, destiny, predetermination, free radicals, presence or absence of free will; but that wouldn't serve any purpose aside wrecking the plot and the experience for you. In its essential, Life is Strange is an experience and a relatable contemplation for your enjoyment, adorned with the simple beauty of human relations - or at least one of the most successful imitation of humane interrelation that I've ever seen in a game.\n\nPlease spare the time to experience Life is Strange. Life is both quite simple and complicated indeed and through that single paradox lies its beauty. How does it all end? Is the ending plotwise satisfying? Oh, I do not know. You wouldn't like to know everything now, right? If so, what would life be without its mysteries and paradoxes?\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","December 20, 2015","true","28.6"," 84 of 99 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","84","99","0","14"

I actually found this to be a very relaxing game, the graphics are very vibrant and beautiful, and the soundtrack is absolutely superb. It's a nice break from Telltale - I've always found their games to have great mechanics, but the stories tend to stress me out. That's not to say Life is Strange doesn't have a good, sometimes chilling story - it just relies on elements such as the characters and events surrounding Max's power, rather than constant tension regarding your survival, or the survival of your comrades. Overall, this is a very enjoyable game, and I suggest that you strongly consider purchasing it.","March 21, 2015","true","16.2"," 104 of 129 people (81%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","81","104","129","10","0"

This game is very similar to “The Walking Dead” and “The Wolf Among Us” with a little twist to it.\n\nYou play Max (ine), an eighteen year old teenage girl with a passion for photography. During class Max experiences some sort of trance and sees something which is similar to a tornado ripping of Arcadia Bay lighthouse, and then she is suddenly back in the classroom totally confused. Finally the class ends. After wandering around the Campus our main character witnesses a crime and, believe it or not, she is teleported back to relive her previous 10 minutes in class. A classic case of Groundhog Day! Then, she realises that she can rewind time. Fabulous idea, especially that all your actions have consequences (just like The Walking Dead but you are not rushed into it). And you can decide which one sounds the more appropriate to lead you into the story.\n\nEpisode one sets the stage and story beautifully. You will meet interesting people including Chloe, Max’s childhood friend.\n\nThe visuals are superb with plenty of opportunities to take great screenshots. Max will certainly envy you for that. The soundtrack is good and the point and click system is very easy to use.\n\nI really took a punt by purchasing episode 1 – 5, but if episodes 2 – 5 are as good as the first one I am in for a little treat.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Beautiful graphics\n-	Good dialogues\n-	Great atmosphere\n-	Achievements\n-	Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	We have to wait until March for the next episode\n\nI really enjoyed episode 1.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/319630/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Playing Life is Strange, it felt like I was looking at a hazy photograph of myself. It follows Max, a nervous, geeky teenager with a love of photography and obscure alternative bands, with big plans for her life but no idea how to achieve them in a world that feels simultaneously overwhelming and incredibly small in her remote hometown. She’s her highschool’s weirdo, tumbling through life trying to do her best and avoid the asshats that seem to wait around every corner. She is, so much that it almost felt creepy, a digital recreation of the person I was and in a lot of ways still am (though certainly a cuter one). This is the most I’ve ever felt like my character in a game was “me”, and that makes for a powerful tool for sparking empathy in a story as personal and scarily relatable as Max’s.\n\nBut Max is also her own person, not just a shell for me to live out a virtual life in. Reading over diary entries, snooping at her texts, watching how she interacts with the people around her, she doesn’t feel like a character, but a human being. I might be able to shape the path she takes, but there was never a pretense that I’m actually in control here, and though that might sound like a bad thing in a video game it works amazingly at creating the same feeling of being powerless in the face of people that seem so above you that Max feels as she struggles to make it out of Blackwell Academy alive.\n\nHighschool is an inherently terrible time, and that’s captured in the people around Max who would seem like diluted cliches if they weren’t drawn from the same people you probably had to put up with too. The rich snobs, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ jocks, elitist science nerds, and general air of animosity is highschool in a nutshell, drawn in a way that’s far less glamorous of cartoonishly absurd as we so often see in media. It’s just highschool, bland and full of petty dramatic; an environment I recognize and want as much as Max to get away from.\n\nIf that sounds like a strange recommendation, it’s because it really is a bit hard to say full heartedly that this is a life I want to go through again. I can relate to Max, but that doesn’t mean I’m any more thrilled about dealing with her idiotic compatriots as they try their hardest to be absolutely despicable. But, that also feels like something that has to exist for Life is Strange to work, and a big reason it feels so real to me. Life just really sucks sometimes, and you have to push through that to find the things and people that make it worth living.\n\nIn Max’s case that person is Chloe, a childhood friend left behind when she moved out of her hometown, now caught up in her own mess. She’s Max’s antithesis; rebellious, outspoken, willing to do anything and think of the consequences later if it means getting out of the hole she’s been left in. Her and Max are all but entirely opposites, and yet able to understand and help each other. It’s not a cheesy kinship, or necessarily an easy one; it feels natural and human, something you have to work at but you can’t imagine losing. As of its first episode, Life is Strange is mostly about the relationship between these two people ostracized from society (though for very different reasons) trying to find their way in a world that seems larger than life. And maybe it’s because I could see myself so clearly in these characters, but that worked for me, and was enough to make me want to stick with these characters.\n\nBut that’s not the only story developer Dontnod wants to tell here, and the other is where they begin to slip up a little, though also where they have the most chance to take the game in limitless directions. See, Max can rewind time, and already she’s had to use it to save someone from being killed (as well as herself). She doesn’t know how she can do it, but now she’s having premonitions, watching the world repeat again and again, and feeling like a lunatic with no way to explain what’s happening. It sounds like the crux of the narrative, and maybe it will be in coming episodes, but where Life is Strange so far really screws up is immediately making Max’s power feel small and ordinary.\n\nThough initially shocked, Max immediately understands how to rewind time, and is entirely unconcerned with using it for even the most mundane tasks. Dontnod has taken something that should be terrifying and impossible to comprehend, and made it just another mechanic to use, which feels more out of place than ever in a world that’s otherwise starkly realistic. It’s also a mechanic that’s used fairly poorly, with puzzles that feel like poor excuses for the mechanic’s existence and causing the choices you make to be fairly unimpactful. Being able see an outcome and then decide if you want to rewind time and change it removes the tension and permanence of the decisions you make, and is something I’m not sure how Dontnod is going to be able to fix the way it’s currently implemented.\n\nAs of now Life is Strange definitely feels like a developer still not entirely sure how to make the game they want to, but it’s a game that also has just as much potential to become something really special if they can break out of the mindset of the more traditional games they’ve made in the past. In a sense, they’re a lot like Max as well. A social misfit among their peers, trying to do their own thing while finding it hard to break out of the current they’ve been caught in, and capable of amazing things if only they can find the voice to channel their passion.\n\nEpisode 2: Out of Time - Update\n\nThough the calendar says otherwise, there’s the unshakable feeling of space between the events of episode one and two, and it’s a space that leads into the troubles Dontnod has fallen into in deciding what direction to take their game. The sense of indecision in “Out of Time” makes it hard to dissect. There are sparks of brilliance within it, yet a glaring amount of wasted time and unfocused direction.\n\nEpisode 3: Chaos Theory - Update\n\nEpisode two of Life is Strange ended catastrophically, and entering episode three, it’s clear Dontnod and the characters they’ve created haven’t forgotten. The tone is noticeably subdued and disquieting, with the walls between characters having been broken down as they all share in the shock of what has happened. In these opening moments, it felt like Life is Strange had finally found the direction it wanted to head in, following characters we don’t often see and being willing to go to dark places to tell a story that’s emotionally resonate.\n\nEpisode 4: Dark Room - Update\n\nFor so long I’ve been so unsure of what Life is Strange is that I’ve been unable to even begin to determine what I want it to be and how well it has managed to live up to that. My expectations have risen and fallen with such erraticism that by episode four I was actively attempting to throw out any preconceived notions about what I was getting myself into in the hopes that I’d come away less disappointed, or preferably be utterly blown away.\n\nEpisode 5: Polarized - Update and Final Thoughts\n\nThere are so few narratives in this medium that even approach what Life is Strange manages on so many levels, that even if it had to happen within a game which often couldn’t decide what it considered important, what it accomplishes despite all its flaws should speak for just how much this game matters, and how important it is to experience for yourself.\n\nUnfortunately I've reached the character limit for Steam reviews so I'm unable to post my full review past episode one.

To be honest I wasn't so sure a game featuring a time-travelling teenage girl dealing with typical teenage issues would be for me considering that I am a middle-aged guy whose interest in point and click adventures died along with Sierra and Lucas Arts and who has all but long forgotten what it was like to be an emotionally charged teenager with all those hormones doing crazy things to the body and mind. Telltale has done a pretty good job of late reinvigorating my love for what was once my favorite type of computer game growing up as a teenager but that is the beauty of this wonderful medium that we all enjoy because Life is Strange took me on one hell of a journey that I am likely to never forget. In fact this entry from DontNod is so strong it outplays Telltale at their own episodic best.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539738788\nWhile the first episode did nothing much for me as we are introduced to our main protagonist, Max, a young photographer who discovers she has time travelling powers, taking in her first semester at the Art college of the old neighborhood she moved away from many previous years before is chock filled with just about every single teenage movie cliche you can think of as we are introduced to the tom-boy best friend Chloe and the school ♥♥♥♥♥ Victoria and a host of other brainiacs, hipsters and jocks that all behave and talk like they are staring in the latest Hollywood teenage high school drama. The only thing they are not doing here is breaking out into song. I am glad I stuck it out for the rest of the game because precisely where episode one ends and episode two begins is where Life is Strange branches off into about 600 different directions I didn't think the game would go. There is some very dark subject matter that gets covered throughout the course of the remaining episodes that includes suicide, drugs and of course a serial killer that is drugging then killing young woman for pure pleasure not to mention an impending natural disaster that could or could not be the cause of our main protagonist tinkering with the very fabric of time itself.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=556150260\nThe unveiling of who is killing these young woman by the final fifth episode is so bleak, appalling and scary and told so realistically that I would not recommend any parent fall into the trap thinking this is a children's game. This is also the first game that left tears streaming down my face at the conclusion of episode 4 where our two best friends make a grim discovery in a junk yard. It's an emotionally wrenching scene brought to incredible life by some of the finest voice acting I have ever heard in my life. Played out to the tune of one of the saddest songs ever (Mountains by Message to Bears) it was the narrative high point in a tale that just seems to get more and more oppressively bleak as the story moves forward.\n\nOne thing Life is Strange excels at is it presents fully fleshed out characters that over the full course of the game have you completely and fully 100% emotionally invested in. It's almost like they transcend the fact that they are made simply with pixels and some binary code and become almost real and life-like despite some dodgy lip-syncing. The ending, when it arrives, is one of quiet devastation. It actually left me shaking at my desk. Life is Strange is also accompanied with possibly the greatest gaming soundtrack I have had the pleasure of listening too. Every single piece of chosen music (mostly taken from the Indie music scene) fits the game perfectly.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=557636465\nDon't be so quick to write Life is Strange off as some teenage fad that took the gaming world by storm last year. There is some powerful ♥♥♥♥ going on here and if you are emotionally brave enough to handle it then miss this one at your own peril. As far as episodic narrative gaming goes - this is up there with the best. For maximum effect, if you are a guy, dress as a girl before booting up Life is Strange.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","February 21","true","17.3"," 59 of 68 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","59","68","2","2"

I had no idea of the vitriol about the game before playing it.\n\nYou are Max Caulfield, a student with a photography scholarship at a college, a little shy and insecure of her talent, you have to survive school (and a giant tornado, but I'll get onto that later). There's also the case of a missing student which remains unsolved.\n\nStandard WSAD for movement, shift to jog, the only thing that you need to get used to is how to interact with the surroundings, holding the left mouse button down and then moving the mouse to choose the option (usually Look, Open, Photo, etc.). Objects you can interact with are pointed out with white text and arrow, and hovering your mouse over them results in the items being 'sketched' over. Occasionally you can't see the interaction since your character is in front of it (namely in closed quarters), so you have to guess where to aim, though these are few and far between.\n\nGameplay is not that of a standard game. Comparisons have been made with 'Gone Home', and it does feel like that, you can look at posters and they pop up on the screen showing everything on it. There is even an option click read so all the text is simply written out to read without all the images getting in the way. This is more of an exploration point and click.\n\nEpisode 1 review:\nIf you were to just rush through and get to the end of the first episode, I wager it would take no longer than an hour, if you knew what you had to do.\n\nHowever, this isn't what the developers had in mind, in my opinion. The world was made to be looked at, and I think I pretty much interacted with everything I could. Overall it took me 5 hours to see everything and test the time reversal power.\n\nThis isn't exactly a spoiler, since you see this in the very first scene of the game, but I have blocked it just in case.\n\nYou awake to find yourself in an area near a lighthouse (sound familiar?), you follow the path up to the building and then to your left, you see a gigantic tornado (think the F5 from the movie Twister) over the ocean, moving towards a small town. A boat destroys the lighthouse and a part of it lands on Max, who then wakes up in a lesson at her college, confused of what happened. She thinks she had a weird dream, and then you take part in the lesson, giving wrong answers and being teased by a fellow classmate.\n\nLater, you walk through the corridors and head to the bathroom to get over that tornado image. Wanting to then take a nice picture of a butterfly, she sees a boy go into the girl's room with her, and another girl joins him while Max hides. A minute later, after a small argument, the boy shoots and kills the girl. Max holds her hand out and then rewinds time completely to the beginning of the lesson again.\n\nThis is a great introduction to the time rewind, since we know this event was happening now. A new aspect appears too. When Max doesn't know the answer to a question, and the rival student gives the correct answer, you can choose to rewind time and give the exact same answer!\n\nNote that time rewind can be done by yourself whenever you want; there is no need to even do it once if you don't want to. The first time you really need to use it for the story to progress is to save the girl's life in the bathroom.\n\nUsing time rewind to give different answers is a subtle way, but another way you learn to use it is to cause events to happen by changing future events, such as gaining entry to a building and so on. You can even peek into private belongings and learn what there was in there, and then rewind time so the other person doesn't even know you have done so. The only restriction of the time control is that once you leave an area (i.e., school, dormitory etc.) you cannot rewind time to go back into the previous area, so important choices from there remain the same.\n\nOnto the story itself, so far, it is mainly to do with learning about the different characters you can interact with, and also about your own self. It is a typical sleepy town and school, are has a very nostalgic feel to everything, and reminded me about school and university. There are several places you can just sit down and wonder about your life and new powers, leaning against a tree thinking about your choice to come back to the town, playing your guitar with a mellow tune, all lead me to like the character more since she is struggling to find her way in life, and if her choices are right in the end.\n\nThe game includes social media, memes (3.14 backwards equals PIE) and other throwbacks in the writing and artwork, references to Lord of the Rings, Twin Peaks, X-Files and other series are easy to find. A Facebook clone is seen in some screens, selfies, even Instagram style filters on certain scenes appear. The music is nothing pretentious and gives this feeling of relaxation overall, good voice acting, though lip syncing seemed to be off in most scenes, nothing game breaking though. Overall, it is quite a post-modernist game which pokes fun at this social media connected world, and quotes and integrates them in daily life. Even one great line appears in the game, which made me chuckle:\n\n"Okay. I see you're a geek now with a great imagination, but this isn't an anime or a video game."\n\nWhich it obviously is, thus making me love the game more, since it realises that such things cannot be in reality, yet in that reality, it is true.\n\nEpisode 2 review:Good continuation, and brings more depth to the powers showing them off further, ending in a breath-taking finale.\n\nEpisode 3 review:One plotline is resolved, and we get a brand new power, which is admittedly used only once. Then, there is a horrid scene where you are completely unable to rewind time, which helps you realise how blase you can be without the ability. After this ending, you get an important new power, which changes the whole timelines, leaving you with an evil cliffhanger.\n\nEpisode 4 review:The huge change you made at the end of Episode 3 ends quickly, with a terrible decision to make. As you delve into the mystery of the missing student, you eventually get to find out exactly who was the perpetrator of it all ina nail-biting cliffhanger.\n\nEpisode 5 review:The finale. Using the time rewind power you got at the end of Episode 3, several times, you manage to escape, and then you have to come to terms with what your meddling with time has done.\n\nThe ending is a simple decision, and none of your previous choices will affect either one. I know this will upset most people who play the game, but think just how hard it is to actually code in several endings depending on your choices.\n\nOverall, the game starts off like a university social life simulator 2015, later becoming more detective-like and uncovering the mystery. Max comments on big decisions, wondering if the other choice was better, and some choices which may seem obvious will have repercussions in future. Regardless, sometimes even she isn't sure which the better choice is.\n\nThe story is amazing, and grips you from beginning to end. Well worth playing.","February 4, 2015","true","24.0"," 77 of 97 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","77","97","6","6"

Will heavily rewrite this review to include updated information.]\n\nHaving played some of the recent Telltale games and really enjoying them, I thought I'd give this game a try. I'm very happy to say Life is Strange has met my expectations - honestly, far exceeded them - with the execution and flexibility that the game has demonstrated.\n\nThe game is set in a high school setting, a special school for photography. Initially I was a bit annoyed when the main character Max starts nerding out about cameras in jargon I didn't understand, but it really grew on me once I started to get to know Max more! Just one of the things in the characters and dialogue that makes it so immersive. It depicts the high school setting very well, in a way that's kind of nostalgic and didn't turn me off like I'd expected it to. There's lots of teen drama, but I think the game makes it easy to empathize with, and you realize that these characters aren't just "stupid teens", in fact they're really resourceful and intelligent.\n\nThe gameplay, once you get past the initial figuring-things-out stage, is very smooth. Time rewinding is executed very well and the game adapts instantly to your choices. Finish a dialogue and don't really like it? Rewind, and instantly the people you interact with change according to what you have done in the new reality you've created. There are many small choices that impact what characters bring into conversation with you - leave evidence while snooping and have someone accuse you of it, and don't like that? Rewind, remember not to leave evidence, and watch the accusing character immediately change their body language and what they remember. I don't want to bring up comparisons that much, as I feel this game stands so well on its own, but well, compared with Telltale's games which really have the same story no matter what you do (mostly the difference is person A v.s. person B is dead), this game does feel like storytelling with instant player influence and control.\n\nOverall, I think this game has great immersion and execution, and if you like games like this and would want to play one of the best I've experienced, try this game out! I look forward to future episodes and seeing how things branch out. One last thing - I love the "collectible mode" in the end which allows you to get achievements without affecting your previous choices or going through the hassle of replaying everything - the devs really are super considerate!","February 15, 2015","true","32.3"," 55 of 65 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","55","65","5","0"

It's like Gone home, Telltale games and Beyond two souls had a threesome and the Life is strange was born.

I was skeptical about time reversal but i think i liked it after all. In other games involving choices you always think that you could‘ve done something different. In life is strange you change your choice if you want. But this doesn‘t mean that there‘s only one correct choice. The choices really matter in this, you can change things with your choices unlike in Walking dead, where choices doesn't matter at all and you're getting the same outcome in the end.\n\nMain character Max wants to be a photographer and photography is involved in every step. This game is made for a photography (screenshot taking), there‘s plenty of perfect photo shots to take. Achievements involve taking photos too.\nAnother thing which makes this game awesome is music. It creates amazing atmosphere and it‘s nice sometimes just to sit besides the tree or lie in bed and listen to the music. It's so relaxing.\n\nI see only one negative thing about this game. Ok maybe two, but they‘re similar to each other. That would be facial animations and lip sync. Sometimes it‘s really annoying to see static faces and lips moving like saying blah blah blah.\nCan‘t wait for the next episode and find out what happened next. If you like a good mystery story and choices which actually matter buy it.\n\nHere's what can i say about other episodes. If you liked the first episode, you will like the second more even more. It's amazing. This is definitely one of the best if not best game in the genre.\n9/10","February 8, 2015","true","22.8"," 78 of 102 people (76%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","76","78","102","10","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hokohuang/recommended/319630/","hokohuang","hokohuang","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hokohuang/","277 products in account","I've been addicted to  the point&click games  purely driven by stories since Quantic Dream and TTG opened this era. With or without puzzles I don't care any more, a good story is the only thing that counts.  One big but simple reason is that such games always provide player with her/his own point of view.  I love the freedom to dig into a story ,  to react in a dialog, to  move the camera lens,  to linger at my favorite scene...  It makes the protagonist intimate, and story immersive,  with so much ease.\n\nSo from my perspective, Life is Strange is quite a success. The atmosphere  this game has developed is so fascinating.  I should have mentioned that I am not a citizen of US or any other English speaking country ( the clumsy writing probably sold me already..) , I'm living and grew up in a country where the youth live a different style, but  I can still feel the story real. While  following Max's footsteps and listening to her smart comments, I was drawn into  this western campus world and found it familiar without much difficulty.  I especially love the aquarelle-like graphic there at the school lawn, everything is warm toned. Sitting under that maple tree , basking in the sunlight and observing surroundings, I did feel the exact excitement and anxiety inside Max about the strange moment of that day, or maybe of her life. This is just one of the solitude moments which come from the most brilliant feature of this game. I don't know the filmology definition of this trick. It's like to keep playing one scene over and over with several cameras from different angles , and make player tasting the feeling, which is mostly triggered by Max's monologue,  as long as (s)he wants. It feels so good. And music serves the scenes very well. e.g. in Chloe's house, "Santa Monica Dream" is so fitting to bring up the meaning of "You can never go home again" that it made me cry a bit in the deep heart .\n\nThe game is very adept at extracting emotion from non-dialogue elements, which is new in this genre.  Though the story of the first episode emphasized on introduction, with this quality I have no reason not to put my faith in Dontnod.\n\nedited :\n\nAs for the story\nto avoid spoiler by accident (I found no point to write a review covered with a lengthy black shield as my last one) , I am  just going to answer two questions which I guess most people might be interested:\n\nQ: I know the story is a science fiction, but how deep is it？ Is the protagonist's supernature power just used as a minor prop to depict a realistic topic.\nA: Nope, though I personally had hoped it to be so(like the movie About Time, it would be more of a challenge),  the story turned out to be rotating around supernature in the end of the episode, a havoc can be predicted, and Max's power will play a great part in it.\n\nQ: Do those choices take effect in the ending ?\nA: The answer cannot be told in the first episode, but I am confident of a "YES", at least to the following episodes if not the ending. The choice results differentiate quite clearly, and in later scenes game does remind you that it has remembered your choice, and hints those would carry more effects in the future.\n\nOne flaw: overuse of Max's rewind.\nI like rewind interfering choices, that really frees me  from the painful S/L and replay-the-whole-scene process only to  correct the "false choice" . But in other situations , they might have overused it. Like , to "force" Max  do something rude and rewind to wipe out the consequence,  sometimes make me feel Max bear no bottomline in morality. And I can see they were trying hard to attach the rewind to some puzzle-solving. While some tricks relating to story and characters are actually fun, the others  look rigid and unnecessary.","January 31, 2015","true","19.1"," 110 of 154 people (71%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","71","110","154","6","5"

Life is Strange is a highly story based game that features player choices, the consequences of all your in game actions and decisions will impact the past, present and the future. So you have to choose wisely and take best decisions. You also can rewind time and back to the past for taking right decisions. This is the main super power of it's main character name's Maxine Caulfield. This is the best thing i got in this legendary game ever. Such a incrediable story based game from DONTNOD.\n1. Best Story Based Game Ever.\n2. Best Graphical Quality in 2D.\n3. Every Characters Are Perfectly Choosen.\n4. Soundtracks Are Greatly Matched With Gameplay Atmospheric Situations.\n5. Best Episodic Game Ever.\nYou will love this awesome game for sure. There is many things in this game you will love. This is not a action game at all but it's a life pattern changing game. We can understand many things from this awesome game. This game taught me that our only good decision can make our future bright n better but our only wrong decision can spoil our future. Now um double die hard fan of this excellent game. Um just too addicted n um also greatly in love with Chloe. I would love to say that Life is Strange is best storied game in games history ever with great perfection of character cast\n\nThere is no bugs, error, crashes in this game. But for some fixes, they arranged some fix updates for better playing. After these updates, this game is now totally perfect and polished one.\n\nIf you like story based game then this game is best choice for you. Life is Strange is story based game only. They made it's story incredible and fabolous. After playing this game, you will surely vote this game for Ultimate Best Game of The Year (GOTY).\n\nToday i just played Life is Strange Episode 5 Polarized, I think Polarized is the best episode yet for me. There was so much emotional moments that i have to face. I faced so much hard moments to take right decision. Maybe i took the right decision by saving my beloved Chloe. I did what my heart said to me. So that was the proper ending for me. I am really happy that i was able to save my Chloe. I spent so much time by playing this heart touching game, I think every moments i spent on this game really worths. I am nothing, not even a gamer but a fan and player of Life is Strange. Chloe worth more than others to me, that's why i saved her. I couldn't stop crying after watching the end. Ending was so much heart touching. Life is Strange is really a legendary game. There is nothing left to see of Life is Strange's story. Life is Strange taught me many things, How to save my beloved one and keep her secure by my own right decisions. I am glad that my Chloe survived. I am never gonna leave her again. When i play Life is Strange, It feels like i am in this game with my Chloe, talking with her, walking with her, kissing her and loving her. I love her so much that i can't even explain. Is she really exist in this world somewhere, if yes, I would love to bet my whole life to find her and make her my own. I don't know why i feel such pain in my heart when others flirts with her.  So i just wanna say one thing that Life is Strange is the best game yet with heart touching and excellent story of Max and Chloe. I completed this game so many times but didn't yet completed for century. I am feeling so much bad i can't wait anymore for another episode of this game because it's end. But i am never gonna forget this game. Will stay with my Chloe and Max forever. I love you Chloe. Thanks for giving me a chance to play this game. Thank you so much. That's all i want to say about Chloe, about Max, about Life is Strange.\n\nThe shot of Chloe driving the truck right before they stop for a moment, is so full of life, and the interchange when Chloe rubs Max's arm is so tender that it makes this ending (which is the only one I will play) worth everything. Sure it isn't as completely developed as the funeral ending, and the fan made endings are nice, but even without them, it still works for me.\n\nMy experience with Life is Strange in those 10 Months\nAs we all know each episodes were getting release in every 2 months laters. So when i first tried Episode 1 it was hella blast because it was like reality even with time travelling power. So after finish first episode all i have to do is just wait for next episode, So i did and bought Season Pass. So that day came and Episode 2 released so i downloaded as quick as i can. Even this episode was amazing with peaceful experience at Junkyard and saving Kate. Then i started waiting for Episode 3 Chaos Theory for 2 month again. So finally after almost 2 month, i got to download Episode 3 and hella waited to just start it. But i wasn't expecting it what i had to see at the end of it which was like killing my soul beneth me. So it was like freaking my mind thinking what happened with her. But grabbing some usual theories i trusted that Chloe must be driven her father's car when Max told William to go through Bus. So it was really hard to wait 2 more month for Episode 4 but somehow i did it. Then that terrible moment arrived and Episode 4 came out. So i got to see Max get back to real universe from alternative universe to fix her because Chloe was so much sick what was near to die. But at the end of Episode 4, it was like someone hella ♥♥♥♥ing myself damn. That cliff hanger ending just killed me. That was so much freaking hard to wait for the last episode 5 Polarized. So as we know Polarized was the final episode of this title and it was such a blast to know how Max saves Chloe with her amazing power and excellent ways. At the end i finally chosen to save my angel Chloe and sacrificed that cursed Arcadia Bay with it's jinx peoples. But i felt so much bad for Kate, Joyce, David, Victoria...","June 20, 2015","true","593.5"," 55 of 67 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","55","67","9","17"

Life Is Strange...I love this game. I'll be honest here, I was so fascinated throughout the whole story. I went blind into the game without knowing much and I didn't expect to be mindblown, so it was one HELLA surprise. It quickly became one of the best games ever for me :D. Of course everyone got their own points, which make a game "best" or good but for me the most important part are them strong and tearful emotions.\n\nIt's a very interesting and beautifully crafted masterpiece, which focuses heavily on story and characters, with fantastic time bending gameplay. You will care about the characters a lot, much love to Max and Chloe :D (ultra crush on M+C lol), who feel so real as characters by the way. Their voice actors Hannah Telle and Ashly Burch do superb work in the roles. Also the soundtrack is so wonderfully  beautiful, it hits you right into the deep emotions.\n\nLIS is like an amazing journey through friendship and life. It's as if you are there with Max, making all these moments become so real. I would say that it's kinda a mix of Telltale games, Heavy Rain, 80's Twin Peaks tv-show and Butterfly Effect-movie.\n\nIt made me remember my younger days and old friends... which is amazing. I was able to relate to the characters a lot, especially Max because of my similar experiences during school life, relationships and shyness for example. I don't often play a game with so much decision making and some of them honestly feel SUPER difficult, so need to think a while about what choice is right. It has a lot of funny stuff and some puzzles too. You make your own unique adventure in cool ways.\n\nDuring first minutes it might seem like only some typical school-drama stuff, if you aren't still interested in it. But trust me the more you play, the more awesome and mysterious it gets and it will surprise you. As you progress further, you will know what I mean as it gets jaw-dropping. I was already addicted to it from the start of EP1. The journey through Max's and Chloe's time together is unforgettable experience to me, with choices that made me laugh and cry tears of joy and sadness.\n\nI didn't think I would cry rivers at first, but especially endings of every episode and 5th...holy ♥♥♥♥. It was unavoidable and I'm a sucker for this kind of story rich experiences about friendship <(^_^)>...\nYeah, I do love games that make me shed some manly tears, because not many have given me something like this during my 20 years of playing and I personally think it is truly special for a game to give that. You will love LiS too. I think Life is Strange made me feel all these emotions more than any other game, movie, tv-show etc after so many years... Which is why it very well could be the best game I have ever played. LiS touches closely to my heart and soul.\n\nAnyways, long story short... everyone should live through this Strange Life. I know developers make art, when they make me care about characters so much to feel this way and when I can't stop thinking about the journey, I rate it HELLA 11/10. Thank you so much DONTNOD, I'm forever grateful for this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/319630/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer/publisher.\nLife is Strange is an episodic adventure game, developed by DONTNOD Entertainment and published by Square Enix. The first episode was released in January 2015, and the next 4 episodes were released periodically throughout the rest of 2015, before coming to an end in October.\n\nThe game play within Life is Strange is done from a third person perspective, and is mostly done with the character Max Caulfield. One of the biggest mechanics in the game is Max’s ability to rewind time, this is used right the way through the game to help solve puzzles and to get out of sticky situations, whilst the plot also heavily focuses on it.  Like with most adventure games, you will have the chance to interact with lots of objects in the world, as well as open dialogue with other characters.  A lot of the game will be dialogue based with the main characters and some of the smaller roles within the story. At times throughout each chapter, you will have to make important choices that will affect the way the story progresses and ultimately, how the story ends.  Whilst the dialogue between the characters does have a lot of choice, there are only a few select moments that have a real effect on the story, the rest of it purely is there to add a little different flavour to each person’s play through.\n\nI was a little let down by the game’s graphics unfortunately. Even though I was playing on 4k resolution with everything turned up to the max setting, the graphics were very poor for the most part. The animation of the characters movement is done to an acceptable standard, but the facial expressions and lip syncing between the speech and character is just completely off and does look very bad. The game’s lighting effects are done very well though. I particularly like the scenes at the seaside as this really shows off some cool effects from the light.\n\nLife is Strange has one of the best stories in video games that I have had the pleasure of experiencing.  The story does start out quite slowly but as you progress through the chapters it quickly gathers pace and excitement as the characters develop into almost life like beings. You gain a real sense of connection with Max and co as you get towards to the end of the game. The plot touches on some very taboo subjects which are often frowned upon but I really liked seeing them be put out there to give them more awareness in the world we live in.  This is one of the few games that really had an emotional effect on me at the end credits; the story was absolutely breath-taking. This should be one of the games used as an example to show that gaming can have a true emotional effect on anyone. I would be surprised to hear anyone say after finishing the game, that they weren’t left affected for a good period afterwards due to the power of the story line.\n\nThe spoken dialogue and sound effects throughout the game are all done very well. Personally I think all adventure games like this in the common day need high quality voice overs for it to be an enjoyable experience overall.  The game has some really awesome music in too with all of it coming from licensed artist, whilst I had not heard of them before; I’ll definitely be checking them out now.\n\nThe majority of the game play in Life is Strange is not difficult per say. There are some scenes which require you to use stealth mechanics in order to escape certain situations, but the main focus of gameplay is on the puzzles and dialogue. The puzzles are all fantastically designed, and you should always remember you have your rewind time ability as this plays a crucial role in a lot of them.  I did have to refer to a wiki a few times as I was lost as to how to progress at points but the rest of the time I was able to figure it out for myself. There are no absurdly complicated puzzles when you compare it to other modern day adventure games like Dropsy for example.\n\nI finished the whole series of Life is Strange in about ten hours. I did play the first two chapters when they were originally released, but I personally need to play episodic games like this one after another, as I just lose track of where I am in the story. I replayed the first two chapters on my second attempt and finished the rest of the game off, with collecting a couple of optional achievements along the way. I personally think the length of each episode to be the right amount; you are looking at about two hours for each one, which is definitely more than enough for you to get an enjoyable experience out of each.\n\nTechnically I had no problems whilst playing the game. You can play the game with a controller, but I would personally opt for the keyboard and mouse given the type of interaction you will have to make throughout your play through. The game runs at a steady 60fps almost all of the time, as there are no real taxing graphic scenes.\n\nTo sum up, I think Life is Strange was probably one of the best games to be released in 2015. Even if you aren’t a fan of the adventure game genre, Life is Strange will definitely still be an experience you need to see for yourself. The story alone is brilliant with some great voice acting. If you can look past the poor graphics you will certainly enjoy your time with this game. It is certainly my favourite adventure game of all time though. You can pick up all five episodes for £15, 99 which is a really good price for the quality of game on offer, or if you are still on the fence, you can pick up just episode one for £3, 99 or even just try the demo for free.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Usually I'd suggest to wait to review an episodic game before it is released, but I was extremely impressed by this.  As it goes through the rest of the episodes, I will edit this.\n\nYou are Max, a girl with a passion for photography who has returned to her home town Arcadia to go to a private school that only accepts seniors.  There are posters everywhere of a missing girl named Rachel Amber.  Very early on in the game, you discover something strange about yourself: you can reverse time.  This has a pretty important role as you can imagine.  Not long after you discover this power, you use it to save the life of your old best friend Chloe who you havn't seen or spoken to for 5 years, until now.  As you two get reacquainted you discover that Chloe was close to Rachel, and now you both want to find out what happened to her.  As things go on, it becomes clear that whatever happened is extremely complex.  Lots of people are involved, lots of things going on, and everything seems to be connected.  They are weaving this story together in an amazing way.  You'll have to deal with some pretty heavy stuff.\n\n<3 Max and Chloe\n\nAs you go, you will make all kinds of decisions that will have an impact on the story, and what people think of you, as you progress.  And if right after you make a decision you decide to change your mind?  Reverse time and change it.  It gives you some control over the course of events like that.  However typically the choices you make are difficult ones.  There is almost never a clearly obvious right thing to choose, and I think that's good.  However some decisions can be quite odd too.  All of them really make you want to know what happens next though.\n\nI did encounter a few bugs.  A couple of times during conversation with other characters, people would stop moving their mouths while talking, or freeze completely, and once or twice I had to restart the game.  Overall though, nothing terrible.\n\nThe characters are interesting, the story hooks you in and makes you want more and is woven together expertly, the art style is pretty (like a painting), and the music is great.  I think we're in for a really great (and very emotional, possibly even disturbing if it isn't already on some levels) storyline.  I definitely feel tension rising in the storyline.  Things are escalating and building and it's getting pretty crazy.\n\nLife is strange, indeed.","March 18, 2015","true","5.6"," 57 of 75 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","57","75","8","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/z-pac/recommended/319630/","z-pac","^z-pac, #MaxCaulfield *_*","http://steamcommunity.com/id/z-pac/","53 products in account","[Review written after completing all 5 episodes]\n\ntl;dr - Awesome story, amazing and likeable characters, a surreal emotional rollercoaster, if you get attached to the characters. Would happily pay a lot more for the game.\n\nComing from a gaming background with years of mostly multiplayer FPS and MMORPG games, Life is Strange still managed to be the game with which I identify myself the most. With well-written characters, an interesting story and a lot of though decisions to make along the way, the game really struck home to me, emotionally.\n\nLife is Strange puts you in the shoes of Max Caulfield, a 18 year-old aspiring photographer who returns to her hometown of Arcadia Bay after 5 years, to study photography at Blackwell Academy. The story initially appears to be the typical high-school drama, with pretty much every stereotype character in it, but you soon realize that there's a lot more to it. As the game progresses, you are presented with a series of choices that may or may not alter the course of history.\n\nPersonally, I immediately resonated with Max's personality, from the start of Ep. 1. That made me care even more of what was happening to her throughout the story and urged me to really think through each and every decision that would affect her and her friends. And believe me, you will probably take a very long time to make up your mind in some of the decisions, if you really care about the characters.\n\nThe relationship between Max and her bff is heart-warming, to say the least. I really enjoyed seeing their friendship re-bloom after Max's 5-year absence period, in such a meaningful way. After both being through all sorts of shenanigans (and some horrific moments)  together, the game shows you the pure core of their friendship and how much they really care about one another, which I found beautiful...probably because it's the type of relationship most of us would actually strive to have in our lives (and probably only comes true in movies).\n\nThe story is complimented by amazing hand-painted scenery. It is clear that the devs put in a lot of effort to get the mood of each scene right. From the lighting to the top-notch voice acting, it all comes into place nicely. And don't get me started in the soundtrack! I'm mostly a hard-rock and metal guy, but I couldn't imagine a more perfect set of songs for this type of game. The most emotionally intense scenes along with the soundtrack can't help but to get me teary-eyed.\n\nOne of the minor negative aspects that most people mentions is the lip-sync. Recent patches improved upon this issue, and, although it's not as good as the lip-sync in TLoU, for example, it is still pretty accurate.\n\nWith this all being said, the season pass really is a bargain at 20€. I would happily pay 3 times as much for it, given all that I've been through with Max, playing the game. If you're still unsure about buying this, I hope this review will convince you to do so :)\nYou can also watch a playthrough of the game, but I really advise you to experience the game on your own. I watched a playthrough of ep. 1 before buying it and it felt much more emmersive to make decisions on my own.\n\n[Mention about ep5 ending. Spoilers ahead!]\nAfter reading a bunch of posts in reddit and the steam discussion forum, it appears that there's a lot of people disappointed with the two possible endings. The two main reasons are the many questions remaining unaddressed and the lack of actual consequence of all decisions made in the story ending.\nAs for the unanswered questions, one may argue that it is a bad and lazy writing choice to let the player draw his/her own conclusions. But, as someone on reddit said, this game taught me that sometimes the journey is the goal, not the destination. And, for me, the journey blew all expectations, as it hit me in more ways I would ever imagine. With 2+ months of waiting for the season finale, a lot of speculation and theories on how would it all end probably led to a bigger disappointment, when you realize some of the aspects we were all so intrigued about weren't addressed in the end.\nAs for the story endings, the lack of more possible outcomes may feel like the story ends up being more "linear" as one would hope for, after all the decisions made. I'm ok with both endings, as they at least made sense to me(and some people even saw it coming from day 1). However, I was hoping the game would reveal what happaned with some of the other characters and hopefully provide a bit more closure. Nonetheless, it was still a great ending, as far as I'm concerned","October 20, 2015","true","106.0"," 49 of 62 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","49","62","5","0"

It is told so well and presented in such a way that you can't help but get lost in this little world. The colorful visuals, amazing soundtrack, good story, and likable characters will get you hooked. The game does a great job setting the theme and atmosphere. With everything going on, you'll see why they say, life is strange. If you truly want to soak in everything, I'd suggest you find some free time alone without interruptions and let the story unfold. It's meant to evoke emotions in the player. Try to explore everything, check every possible conversation option, and find the nice little details within the game. Do however, take breaks between episodes since they can be quite lengthy. While this game is being highly praised, everything isn’t executed perfectly. There are some dull moments here and there, and parts that will slow down the pace of the game, but that isn't enough to keep you away from playing this masterpiece. This game is definitely worth experiencing and I would highly recommend anyone to pick it up.\n\nI'd rate this 9/10.","October 20, 2015","true","36.8"," 44 of 54 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","44","54","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ante_up/recommended/319630/","ante_up","aNte_uP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ante_up/","363 products in account","TL;DR: I want to recommend this game so badly, but as the final episode stands, I simply cannot. It seems the writers/developers either ran out of ideas, money, or time, and the Episode 5 finale is noticeably lower quality than Life is Strange's other 4 installments. The ending is a huge slap in the face and goes aginst the whole premise of the game itself. It's like having a full course dinner at a fancy restaurant, only to have the chef come and sh*t on your plate for dessert; the appetizer and entree may have been amazing, but you sure as hell are not going to leave that restaurant happy, much less encourage others to indulge themselves.\n\nMILD (VAGUE) SPOILERS AHEAD\n\nLet me just preface this review by saying that I enjoyed the majority of this game very much. I am a big fan of the Telltale games, and it felt like this was a step above and beyond anything Telltale has done; my choices, no matter how small, seemed like they actually mattered. The butterfly that lets you know your (perhaps seemingly insignificant) choice will affect something down the road, combined with the ability to rewind and choose differently, provides an extremely unique experience. I was often left sitting, weighing the potential pros and cons for each decision, debating whether or not to go back and pick a different option. The artwork in the game is stunning. The musical choices are outstanding and often add more to an already emotionally-charged game. I became emotionally invested in the story of Max, Chloe, and the mysterious forces of Arcadia Bay. I flew through each episode the day it was released, often sacrificing valuable time which could have been better used for sleeping.\n\nThat being said, my enjoyment of the game halted abruptly with the release of Episode 5. I don't want to go into too much detail, but essentially, every choice made in the game up until the last 5 minutes or so has absolutely no meaningful impact on the ending whatsoever. I was led to believe that each decision I made was perhaps sending me on a different path that would ultimately lead to a (somewhat) unique ending that would differ with each playthrough. As it stands, you are thrown one final decision which renders all other choices irrelevant, and then are played one of two endings. There are no branching paths. Your choices do not matter. You pick one or the other, and you are done. Which leads to another issue.\n\nThe disparity in quality of the two endings is, frankly, staggering. One ending -- the one I am assuming the developers deemed the "good ending" -- clocks in at over 9 minutes long. The other, presumably "bad ending," is around 3 minutes long. The good ending provides a somewhat-fleshed-out conclusion to the story, while the bad ending provides an overwhelmingly cliche, ride-off-into-the-sunset conclusion that provides absolutely no further insight. In my opinion, neither ending should be seen as the "correct" one. Both endings should have been fully realized and provided a satisfying conclusion to my journey, rather than essentially saying, "You picked the bad ending, so let's just cut this sh*t off abrubtly and give you no closure." Both endings, however, are plagued by the fact that they leave a myriad of loose ends and do nothing to tie up any of the interesting story lines or provide any more insight into the things which you were investigating the entire f*cking game. The big plot point of "What happened to Rachel Amber?" is, thankfully, answered earlier in the episode, but the answer feels like a complete afterthought and is not satisfying in the least considering how big of a part of the game it was. Other plot lines ("What's the deal with the seemingly villainous Prescotts?", for example) are just abandoned.\n\nI understand the limitations of a game; a story with an ending for each unique combination of choices simply isn't possible. However, after touting Life is Strange as a game where your choices matter and have a meaningful impact, it seems that the developers have pulled a very obvious bait-and-switch; 2 arbitrary endings where each previous episode means f*ck-all hardly makes it seem like your choices matter at all. I don't know if this was due to time constraints, a lack of funding, or simply a complete lack of effort, but at the end of the day, I feel cheated.","October 20, 2015","false","19.8"," 758 of 1,275 people (59%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","59","758","1","58","54"

I am absolutely all over it.\nAt first look I thought I would hate it, "oh no, not another Gone Home" I said to myself. How wrong I have been.\n\nThis is on par, if not even better, with the recent Telltale Adventure Games.\nIt is incredibly well written narrative experience (some would call it Visual Novel) and offers a fitting style of adventure-esque gameplay to the plot. It fully allows you to chose what pace you want to play the game in. Look at everything, or just go to the next goal.\nI had to look at everything because as a young adult right now you feel blasted right back into you late schoolyears.\nIt has an incredible diverse cast of characters, without forcing a social-justice narrative down your throat (cough cough Gone Home), a thing I was incredibly please by.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing and fits the mood. I was really pleased picking this up and will definately get the rest of it.\n\nThere is one thing I'd have to critizise though, that being the pretty stiff facial animations.\nI heard people say the voice-acting wouldn't be that good, I think it is pretty awesome, it is just held back by really stiff animations at some dialogues.

I personally love the artstyle since nothing I've played really looks like it, and the game is so pretty that it throws you off from the dark things happening in this small town.\n\nThe main character, Max actually has her own personality and history unlike so many main characters which have literally nothing going on inside them. I don't know why games and even tv shows do this - supposedly it's supposed to make you empathize more with the main character so you can picture yourself in their shoes, but I don't have that problem with a character that has an actual personality. So if that's the reason - it doesn't work and is not needed damn it.\n\nSo why don't I want to recommend it? Because it's on sale and this game deserves full price.

To be honest, I didn't watch the Trailer, I didn't read the Description, or any of the Reviews. I had 0% idea on what I even bought through my impulse buying.\n\nAfter starting the Game, I was imediately impressed with it's Visuals, Voice Acting, and the obvious "Gift" mentioned in the Description, [which did take me by surprise, totally wasn't expecting it].\n\nWhen I buy Games, I'll play it for 10 - 30 Minutes just to get an idea of where I want to place it in my "To be Played List". After starting though, I didn't stop until the first Episode was completed, then straight away bought the Season Pass and played through the 2nd Episode. I held off though until the other Episodes became available.\n\nThe Story itself can be very emotional, and even has a Warning in it stating that "If any of the Scenes affect you, then visit www.LifeIsStrange.com/talk to find the closest Support Group in your Area" and for all good reason.\n\nAll depending on how people take Games, some have more of an imagination which allows them to become more attached, so actions in a Game can cause trauma to an individual, especially when a lot of the events in this Game take place in everyday Life.\n\nI'm not one to cry in a Game, or to feel so drawn into the Story that it would in any way make me upset.. It has happened in a few Movies sure, but never a Game. I found my eyes watering many times through this, and I'll admit I cried at the end.\n\nNot only can it be an emotional ride, but on many occassions you'll be left with your Mouth opened questioning "did that really just happen?" Then when you think you have it all figured out, again another complete 180.\n\nI do have to admit, in my 20+ years of Gaming, I have never once been this impressed and drawn into a Story of a Game.

If you love character drama, this interactive miniseries will surely captivate you and make you care about its characters as they slowly drift towards an inevitable tragedy.\n\nLong version:On the surface, Life is Strange is a standard time travel story, presented in an interactive film format: a shy but nosy teenage girl discovers she can rewind time and uses it to save as many people around her as she can, but always ends up in deeper and deeper trouble.\n\nLike with most similar products, there isn’t any gameplay to comment on, the entire thing is the story and its presentation. And in our case, we have somewhat of a mixed bag.\n\nLet’s get the bad side out of the way first: the plot is weak. More than half of it (including an entire episode) is pure filler with no story advancement. It is also riddled with issues like tired high school archetypes that never get past their one-dimensional role, and a B-grade slasher movie serial killer who even has a clichéd bunker hideout.\nOn top of that, it feels like as if the story was originally written for television, as all so-called interactive elements have no real influence on anything. No matter what you choose, all but two scenes have the exact same outcomes with some minor dialogue changes here and there.\n\nSo what is good? The script is. The dialogues are excellent, and the cast made a flawless job at capturing all the wonderful small moments, the tear-jerking character drama that easily elevates this story above many similar products we saw in recent years. These things may seem small compared to the plotting issues, but in reality they make sure that you will hardly regret going through Life is Strange, not even for a moment.","April 17","true","15.6"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","5"

The review describes my expression of the game and nothing more than that. Thanks.\n\n"Submit to the fate and be swallowed by course of events or ... set the world on fire, throwing away everything, except for the one thing you hold dear most." That's what Life is Strange tells us. There are no fairy tales in this world, there are no good endings. You have to get over, or rebel.\n\nFrom a technical point of view – game design, dialogues, scene sequences and decision patters are purely masterpiece. I won't describe them in particular as there is no point to, everyone has to make his own opinion about LiS. Visually, game is outstanding as well. Oh, and OST, I was eager to listen more and more of almost each composition, damn brilliant and fitting soundtrack [which you can't purchase on Steam unfortunately]. Also, just a little self note, but the first 4 episodes were way more cunning and consistent than the fifth, last one.\n\nAbout what really brang me down, and continuing the very beginning of this review, – Life is Strange is all about despair towards the end. You have to make unpleasant and sometimes dire choices which will likely lead to even more terrific decisions. There is no escape, and even though giving us happy and joyful moments, you do realise that each "action holds a reaction" and that what we do to basically save Chloe [aka, sole purpose of the game] and other people will only invoke worse and will finally erupt into a full scale calamity. Or, if you are "brave" enough and ready to bear a burden of leading whole city to destruction, – you can, well, forget everything and submit to your dreams instead. I would lie if I say there is no "hope", but sometimes it is very well-hidden and rather unreachable while having so feeble effect.\n\nWe all have seen these movies/books/whatever where you are supposed to choose whether whole world/planet/nation or else dies, unless you are ready to make a single sacrifice but of what scale for yourself. Right? That's basically an example of such situation. However, in this case we've spent all the episodes trying to get our "one and only" out of the troubles and pain just to face a very familiar unavoidable decision in the end. Both outcomes of which are - bad, from different points of view. Worth mentioning, it's also kind of cliched "Killer is always the Butler" scheme present.\n\nI won't speculate further, I did indeed enjoy the game to the fullest and it was an unforgettable experience. I was empathizing, feeling angry, getting surprised or protesting, but I can't say I really get accustomed to the characters or loved any of them. It is a brilliant play, a breathtaking art and a peculiar (in a good manner) piece which will no doubt mark an internal scar on your soul. But in the end, we all remember it's just a play, and that said a tragedy which doesn't leave us anything to choose besides bad and bad. Not like I wasn't expecting it at all, but at least for me, such harsh and hopeless "finis" was really ... strange.\n\nDon't think of everything I've wrote earlier to be bias in a "bad light". It is indeed a work without actual happy end, but that's exactly what it is defined to be. I feel uneasy after completing, but still give Life is Strange a solid mark which it, and the whole collective behind production, deserves.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\n9 everyday shots out of 10.

Which means something as I've played like TONS of games in my lifetime. But for sure, none has ever hit me in the feels so often like this pearl. Rarely did a game make me care about the protagonists. And I'm usually a stone-cold ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Seriously.\n\nI admit that, if all feelings put aside, the game has some flaws in many aspects. But <beep!> that!\n\n\nWhat's it all about?\nBest way to describe it quickly: A Telltale-game without the pressure of timed events that hits you right in the feels. Regularly. Until the end.\n\nAnd in case you've never played one of the aforementioned:\nIt's an adventure. You play as a young dudette who discovers that she has a ...nah, see for yourself!\n\nOne thing's for sure: I'm totally not the target demographic, so for me it was a bit awkward to play an 18year old girlie geek-hipster, coz i'm\na 40+ year old male geek-nonhipster. But hey, at least I'm as introverted as she is. You gotta\nstart somewhere :-)\nDid it matter? No.\nBut it helps if you're fine with tons of teenie-clichés and modern day references. Yes, the game drowns in clichés but it still manages to be damn lovely all the time.\n\nAdventures like this totally depend on their characters and the story (as there is no real "action" or anything else), and both pay off.\nThe characters are all believable and authentic (even with all those clichés) and the story always has this subtle "wtf is this about?"-tone swinging along even while you do seemingly meaningless tasks. The epic soundtrack (that made me even get the OST) does a big part in setting up the atmosphere.\n\nSo if you're ready to ignore some regurgitated stereotypes and, if you're not a female teenie in school, are open minded for a more or less dramatic change in the point of view, you're in for an awesome tale!\n\nThe good:\nGreat plot, the main topic (you'll know what I mean if you're playing it) is handled pretty well.\nA totally awesome and perfectly fitting and integrated soundtrack. Too many games (and movies) don't care enough!\nRelaxing. No stupid puzzles to blow up game-time, no timer running in decisions (which should have been an option, as many liked that pressure (me not)), and a soothing soundtrack on top\nSome extra stuff to do for the wandering completionist who wants it all\nHighly detailed journal with pictures and all that stuff, like the journal of an 18 year old girlie may look like (what the fork do i know?)\nYou not only have the option to "rethink" about important (and less important) decisions, no it's an important part of it all.\nSaid decisions you can check - like in those Telltales - after each episode and compare yours with those of your friends or the rest of the world\nAt some points you can actively sit back (at a tree, on the bed, etc) and just listen to music. Even that is soothing and well done.\nIf you don't care for the main characters you're probably dead\nMost important: You can learn how NOT to hate hipsters ,-)\nEven Controller-noobs like me can relax with a controller with this one\nThe bad:\nYou should be familiar with memes and other modern references and Internet terminology used by the younger people nowadays, otherwise you'd often be like "hu? wtf?"\nCould be quite short if you just rush to the given task without going around, checking everything out, reading the journal and whatnot. But rushing trough would mean you don't get to know each character better and that's basically like reading a book while skipping pages to get to the end faster.\nSome parts feel like a filler, a time-waster, something to stretch your total playing-time for not much reason. But even those are kinda cute and not even bad.\nThe ugly:\nThe fixed FOV (Field-of-view) is awful. Playing with that for 5 minutes makes me totally nauseous. Luckily you can tweak it, but for the price of a screwed up item-labeling-system (still click-able, but not very obvious) and popping in and out of objects. I would really love a fix or an option here. This is AWFUL.\nRecommended?\nIf you loved the telltales? YES! YES! YES!\nIf you hates the telltales? NO! NO! NOOOOO!\nIf you love adventures for the puzzles and not for story? Nah, stay away, this would bore you to hell.\nFor all else: Maybe give it a go, you may be surprised (like I was...really)!","July 8, 2015","true","42.0"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","25","31","3","19"

It’s annoyingly common for time travel stories to fall apart in their final moments, whether by breaking their own rules about how time travel works—the rules they spent hours establishing, explaining, and demonstrating—or by using time travel to conveniently undo everything that happened so you wonder why they bothered at all. Science fiction stories love to show off some cool concept and then tell you that cool thing was really bad and no one should ever do it. Cloning dinosaurs? Bad idea. Alien contact? Bad idea. Time travel? Even worse than both of those ideas combined.\nEven though I’m angry enough about the ending to write a whole piece about it and then have enough crankiness left over to argue in the comments, when I think back on Life Is Strange the ending is not the only thing I remember. I think about how much fun it was playing at Scooby-Doo while sneaking into the high school at night to investigate, how connected I felt to the characters as they grew from slangy stereotypes into real people, and how heart-wrenching it was tumbling into an alternate timeline where changing the past twisted the present into something unrecognisable.\nEven episode five has a lot going for it if you ignore its closing minutes. The creepiness of The Dark Room was worthy of Twin Peaks, which Life Is Strange has referenced almost as much as Deadly Premonition did. The previously dickish spoilt bully Nathan Prescott left a voicemail that was surprisingly touching. Using Max’s powers to save people from the tornado in a possible future was a fun bit of adventure game puzzling. Being trapped in the retro zone of Max’s nightmares and tortured by her subconscious was an effective detour into horror, lightened by a set of surreal text messages received from sources as unlikely as one character’s dog.\n\nLife Is Strange is far from the first video game to have a disappointing ending. Even a classic like System Shock 2 has a final cutscene that’s hilariously out of sync with the rest of the game's tone, and their somewhat underwhelming conclusions don’t stop Knights Of The Old Republic or Half-Life 2 from earning their place on lists of the best games ever. The original ending of Fallout 3 was so rough that an entire DLC add-on was created to rewrite it, four years before Mass Effect 3 did something similar, but we’re still drooling at the thought of Fallout 4. We’ve forgiven those games because we enjoyed the hours leading up to those endings so much we focus on that instead. We can choose which memories are the ones we care about preserving and, like with photographs, build our albums out of the moments that mattered to us. Life Is Strange is just another game for the “Flawed Masterpieces” section of the album.","October 25, 2015","true","4.4"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","3"

Hate you, Valve.)\n\nThe first four episodes of this game are rich in story and possibilities.  The mix of crime drama and supernatural mystery is compelling.  Along the way, the player has to make some tough decisions with the knowledge that consquences will ripple through the remainder of the story.  Gray areas in morality must be navigated with care, a point episode three drives home with great impact in its climax.  Even with episode 4's questionable choice of direction toward the end, I still found myself invested in the story and the lives of its characters.  I was giddy when episode 5 was released.\n\nThen I played episode 5... and the entire story fell apart.  The final episode starts by spending way too much time featuring the lead character in a deplorable situation, mostly so that an antagonist can monologue... and monologue... and monologue... in an absolutely cliche "Here's what I did and here's how I'll get away with it" manner.  The story only goes more off the rails once the crime drama portion is resolved.  (Well... not resolved.  Concluded, at least.)\n\nAt this point, the game begins to broadcast its ending from miles away.  It's impossible not to see the final choice coming.  When it arrives, it's delivered so painfully black and white that it makes all that gray area navigation throughout the prior episodes pointless.  There is no choice that leads to a satisfying ending, mainly because none of the endings resolve any of the story's biggest questions.  This final choice is the difference between receiving cheap emotional manipulation or receiving a pointless, lazily tacked on finale.  I can't even be nice and say that it leaves more questions than answers, because the questions at that point are just plot holes.  It's clear there was never any intent to resolve them.  At best, they were just strewn about to throw players off the path, but that may be giving the writers too much credit.\n\nGiven that this game was hyped on the importance of player decisions and the array of consequences that can result, it's a big failing that I'm left with zero desire to replay this game with different choices.  Doing so won't offer any new insights or answer any unanswered questions.","October 21, 2015","false","18.4"," 140 of 234 people (60%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","60","140","234","5","2"

You might even learn a bit about Photography here :) I feel like I did.\n\nYou really feel like these characters know each other for years, they have there own live and hobbies and circles of friends and nothing is hammered or forced unnaturaly in.

Do I regret playing it? No. Would I recommend it to you? Yes. Let me explain...\n\nThis spoke to my soul on so many levels. I had a best friend who was I felt was altogether more interesting than me, she was always getting herself (and me) into trouble whilst I just wanted to kunckle down and get an education. I think even if you don't have this perspective, you will find a part of yourself in Max and you will see someone you know or used to know in Chloe - the writers were very smart about the way they approached these two characters, they are absolutely intoxicating. The supporting characters are also extremely well written, add to this a completely mind bending story-line, the ability to undo time (let's face it, everyone at some point in their lives wishes they could rewind something and try again) and a skin-tingling soundtrack and you have one of the best story-based games I've ever played.\n\nSo why am I giving it the thumbs down?\n\nDuring your journey in this game you will make some absolutely nail-biting decisons. Your cursor will be hanging for minutes between two crucial decisions which you know will impact the story in some massive way. And impact the story it does. However, if you're looking for a game with a huge range of multiple endings based on those chain of decisions you've made, well - you're going to be disappointed. In the end, none of it matters and it all comes down to one ultimate decision that decides one of two endings for you. Now, I know its all about the journey, blah blah blah (I've heard it all before with Mass Effect 3) and you can look back and say, "well, clearly the message is - don't mess with time or time will mess with you" but no, I'm sorry. This game could have been so much more with multiple endings.","October 21, 2015","false","16.1"," 151 of 259 people (58%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","58","151","259","20","3"

Yep, the choosing mechanic is very similiar with Telltale Walking Dead series, but don't get it wrong, its similiarity is like Halo has a gun that can reload, just like Call of Duty. Soo, Life is Strange is not a Walking Dead clone.\n\nIt tells the story of Max, a geeky girl that have the abilities to rewind time, how did she get that abilities ?? its still a mystery. There's some mystery here and there like why is he like that, or why did she knows that, and why did she get that strange vision at the beginning of the game ?? Of course like all super hero story, when the main character get that super hero power, they tend to use it on everything even the little things. The episode 1 stop with the main plot unfolding, very cliffhanger, but its an episodic game and i expect no less.\n\nThe characters in this game is really good, all of them is really lifelike, their behaviour and everything about them is very lifelike, and we even got some anti mainstream main character, that is not really confident with herself, very geeky, not perfect, and like to talk to herself a lot. She even kinda talk to herself about her being nosey when a player go to places they are not suppose to go, like when she go to her friend parents bedroom for no reason whatsoever, except because the player want to go everywhere.\n\nThe gameplay mechanic is like i said before, bear the similiarity with Telltale Walking Dead series, like you pick a conversation choices and the game will tell you that there will be a consequences with that choices... But instead of that button smashing dumb quick button event, we got a really cool puzzle that could be solve using the rewind time mechanic, like you don't really like what you said to someone ? Just rewind the time ! Or you really need to hide and crap !! you messed up your hiding spot, just rewind the time and avoid that ! that kind of stuff. Its really soothing because you can take all day to solve the puzzle because if you mess up, just rewind the time and you good to go.\n\nThe visual and audio in this game is design to be soothing and beautiful. The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful, i could listen to all of that all day long just to calm myself. the visual is well. Not AAA good, there's some low poly texture here and there, but its usable. Its very pretty in some area and again the visual is design to give the player that soothing atmosfer and combine that with the audio make this game really calming.\n\nIn the end, this is a really good game and definitely worth your time and money. I don't know what to say, i'm amazed that the developer really know how to give the player a good atmosfer and they didn't afraid to make the main character not the usual confident heroine type. Its really nice just to see her diary and listen to her rambling about stuff. Buy it now or wait for all the episodes to come out. If you like a good story telling, definitely don't miss this one.\n\nUpdated for episodes 2: Episode 2 is still good, in my opinion. This episode explore a bit more about all the characters in the game, and how they react to each other. There isn't a character that just mean, or just nice. All the characters have some depth in them. Each of them has their own problem and reason of why they did what they did. again, making choosing the right decision a lot harder. Its still didn't explain a lot of things. But, thats why there's episodes 3-5 right ? Still recommended.\n\nUpdated for episodes 3: Episode 3 just... awesome. It really depend the story that everything is connected in this big mystery that has yet been revealed. It also really know how to make time traveller nerds (Like me) drooling after finishing the episode. My big complain yet understandable complain is that there's one big plot in game that could change the story as a whole, It could be fun if you can choose a different path and not save a particular someone from dying but the game didn't give me that option. But i know why they didn't give me that option because if i can choose that plot, the episode 4 and 5 plot will be different entirely, and they couldn't make a 2 completely different path for the last 2 episodes.","February 8, 2015","true","23.3"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","3"

Then stop reading this review and just buy this game.\n\nLife is Strange is not finished at the time I'm writing this review, but I wouldn't recommend waiting for the full game. Sure, it could all go straight to hell, but right now you're going to want to experience the mystery at a slow boil like you would a good season of TV. The first chapter sets up Max, a girl who has figuratively "rewound time" to end up back at her small hometown to attend the prestigious Blackwell Academy. After a strange dream of doom she finds that she can *literally* rewind time and that's when, well, life starts to get strange.\n\nThis game has an excellent story so far, full of characters that have some real depth to them and honestly leave me wondering who I can trust. Max herself is a fantastic and likeable protagonist who combines a sort of nerdy naivette with a charming knowledge of nerd culture which manages to make me laugh without becoming a barrage of memes. The dialogue is mostly good, but there are some moments where it pushes belief (like a character who uses the word "hella" waaay too much for 2013. That shouldn't stop you from enjoying the game, though. In fact, it's kind of part of its weird small town charm.\n\nDon't worry about this game being just another novel in game form, either. I have made some choices that had a real impact, including a moment at the end of the second game that had me cursing myself for my own bad decisions. I heartily recommend this game to anyone who loves sci-fi that has a firm foundation in the human element.","April 5, 2015","true","21.6"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","18","22","2","0"

If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below!\n\nRatings for this game at this time are through chapter 4 only.  Review will be updated when each new chapter comes out.  (28 July 2015)\n\nGame OverviewIn Life is Strange (LIS), you are Max, an 18-year-old senior at Blackwell Academy, a special seniors-only high school where talented students go to hone their skills in a creative outlet.\n\nGameplay Mechanics\nThe mechanics of LIS are not difficult.  The camera and movement controls are easy and generally do not interfere with gameplay.  It is occasionally difficult to properly center the mouse on an object, but this is rare.\n\nIn general, it is mostly a WASD/point-and-click game with time to make choices and a low stress level.\n\nStoryline\nIn LIS, the game revolve around you making decisions, some easy and some not.  These decisions have immediate and long-term effects that you discover as the game goes on.  These types of games can be fun in that you can play out your own personality or try out something much different from what you would do - sort of testing the water for what it's like to be someone different.\n\nLIS plays out through a series of causal relationships - things happen that shape the rest of the game - and through Max's own thoughts and feelings about the events, captured in her inner monologue and in her journal, which is updated each time you go to a new 'section' of the game (i.e. crossing to a new area that wipes your rewind ability).  Max's journal entries reflect the choices you make.  In her journal, Max uses English puns more often than any other game I have played.  If you're like me and you don't get puns very often, be prepared. :)\n\nEach of the chapters take around three hours for a moderately in depth gameplay style.  I really enjoy the game, even if this is not my favorite game type.  It is VERY creative, often very beautiful, and it pulls you in to the characters through development and storyline progression.  At times, both the story and character feel a little two-dimensional, but it is handled well by key moments where they begin to shape up again into more believable people.\n\nEach chapter has improved in both the choices you have to make and the storyline.  LIS feels as though it is building to something epic.\n\nGameplay Rating\nLife is Strange is rated 8/10 for gameplay.  The story is fantastic and the effects of the decisions provide a high replay value.\n\nAccessibility Overview\nGame Options\nOptions are available before starting a new game for audio, video, or control changes as required.\n\nDeaf/HOH\nThis game is fully playable for Deaf/HOH gamers!\n\nPros:\n+ Subtitles are on by default\n+ Subtitles cover all speech in game.\n\nCons:\n- No variation in subtitles for speakers (names, color scheme)\n- No variation in subtitles for Max's speech vs thoughts\n\nNotes:\nSubtitles are stylized rather than typeset, but very easy to read white on black.\n\nMobility\nThis game is fully playable for gamers with mobility issues!\n\nPros:\n+ All keys can be rebound\n+ Keys have primary and alternate binds for left/right dominant hands\n\nCons:\nNone!\n\nNotes:\nNone!\n\nAccessibility Rating\nLife is Strange is rated 9/10 for accessibility.  The only improvements are in subtitle indicators for speaker and captions for background noises.  The game is highly playable for all gamers.\n\n---\nVisit Games Reviews for the Deaf/HoHhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamereviewsforthedeaf","February 2, 2015","true","27.5"," 28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","28","40","0","3"

It is a hard feeling to deal with. The characters feel very real. You come to know many of them, and love them almost like real friends. Then the game is over, and those characters are gone. This causes a hurt inside you. Very much like losing dear friends, because there is no continuation for these characters.\n\nThis game is VERY emotional and deals with some very dark, and unfortunately very real things in our world. If you feel for other people, and nature, and the things only humans can cause, whether they are good or bad, this game might make you feel very sad at times, because it puts these things right in your face.\n\nI cried so many times going through this game. I'm a pretty emotional person, but I think these feelings are totally intentional, and so I think the people who made this game did a damn good job. I wish to explore that world and those characters forever, because they seem that real. But, you can't. Much like the themes in this game about how little control we all have over time and events we can't foresee, this game ends and I have to find a way to move on.\n\nThe world in this game is pretty to look at. The graphics aren't amazing, but they are done in an artistic way that reminds me of watercolors or something. The gameplay is very similar to Telltale Games style, in that it is mostly walking around areas interacting with a limited number of objects, and talking to other characters. The real point of the game is the storytelling, and they do SUCH a good job in this one, as I've been over and over here.\n\nI would recommend that if you do play it, take it slow, take long breaks if you need them. I took almost a year break and then several week breaks in between some parts, and it is still messing with me that I can't see anything more from these characters. Only replay the game again. Which, much like replaying a moment in the game with the unique rewinding power, only allows me to see that world again, and not live in it forever.\n\nThis review isn't much of a review, I know. But I don't want to reveal much and I just wanted to put my thoughts on this game out there somehow, even just to help me get through it. Thanks for reading if you do, though, and I hope you can enjoy this game that it seems to me a lot of work and love went into. :)","May 28","true","24.7"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","2"

She meets a lot of new people, a lot of really crazy sh*t happens and she has to make a lot of very hard choices with her new found time rewind powers.\n\nGameplay wise, this game doesn't offer anything crazy, you walk around, search for things and solve a few puzzles using your powers. There are around 10 or so locations that you travel between throughout all 5 episodes all being returned to at some point or another. Sometimes looking for things can be a bit frustrating and can take a few tries to understand what you need to actually do. There are a lot of people you can chat up along the way there are optional photos that you can search for and take to unlock achievements. Other stuff is just interacting with random things to get more information on characters and maybe even find a funny easter egg or two.\n\nObviously this game's strong point is it's story which is the main thing I'm going to talk about in this review while trying to avoid as many spoilers as possible. In total, there are 12 main characters including Max. The story revolves around decisions you make throughout the entire story, each thing having an effect on another thing. Starting off slowly, the story builds itself up slowly and then eventually makes you make brutal decisions. I really adore most decision options in the game because some of them are obvious, some are difficult, and some you know what's the right option but the other one feels a lot better.\n\nNow let's get to the main problem people have with this game. If you look at the negative reviews for this game, most of them complain about how in the end there are only 2 endings and you get to pick your ending right at the very end essentially meaning that all your choices mean nothing. Since when have stories been about the ending? Each choice in the game molds your own unique version of this game. Each person that has played this game has different opinions on all the characters. The sheer amount of variables in this game make it a great game. Don't get me wrong, both endings are great  but  I really do feel like this game is mainly the choices building up the story as a whole not just the ending of it.\n\nThe biggest problem I  personally  have with this game and probably why I will not be giving it a 10/10 score, is the main chunk of Episode 5. The entire game feels so thought out, the story is told so beautifully and slowly throughout the entire game. Most of Ep. 5 feels rushed and blunt. It's just not as good as the rest of the episodes. It made me almost want to put down the game and come back later. The thing that saved this game  were  the 2 endings. This is going to sound crazy that I say that  both  endings reminded me how freaking good this game actually is.\n\nDepending on which ending you end up picking, you will see how you connected with the characters. Obviously all characters in this game are great but the ending really seals the deal on how you feel about them. It's hard to explain without going into detail and spoiling the entire thing for you but just trust me on this one, the endings are bloody brilliant. Not to mention he songs they through into the endings which seriously made the endings for me at least, even more emotional.\n\nWorth mentioning, I had no performance issues playing the game on highest settings which was nice to see with all the extremely pretty hand drawn-like graphics of the game. As much as they were cartoon like, the faces of characters were always full of emotion and really well made. Voice acting was also amazing in this game, really helped connect the characters.\n\nAs much as I love this game a lot, it's not revolutionary. It has a good story, with good characters and it will be remember in my book and many others as a must play experience. It doesn't really do anything that puts it way over other story based games like "The Walking Dead". It just does not cross over that line of a game that changed how we view things in the gaming industry like other games have.\n\nTL;DR\n\nLife is Strange is a must play title, it does have it's quirks and issues and some people like it more than others, but overall it is a really really good game that tells a really good story, not revolutionary, but still really good. If you like story based games, this is a must play game and is a strong Game Of The Year contestant for me, which is something I would've never expected out of a story based game since that usually isn't my cup of tea. But hey, life is pretty f*cking strange.\n\n9.5/10\n\nFor more reviews like this, check out my curation page  here!","January 16","true","14.0"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","5"

She develops more abilities and uses her abilities to save her best friend and help solve a mystery surrounding Arcadia Bay as the story progresses. For the first four episodes, the choices she make will affect the storyline. Each episode will take approximately 2-5 hours to finish. As Max progresses through the story, she can form friendships with many characters, have romantic relations with two characters and have a few enemies in the game. The game had great soundtracks and the character models and animations are also well-done with a lot of attention to detail. All achievements in the form of taking optional photos in-game are also easy to find and obtain. The only complaint I have for this game is that the final episode was a disappointment as there were only two bad endings and it had many unexplored plot twists and unanswered questions.\n\nOverall, highly recommended as the best game for 2015.","November 1, 2015","true","93.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","1"

They become meaningless if you do so but to me, this game is a real pice of art. A lot of different elements come together to make something that's very special.\n\nI don't want to get bogged down in details but Life is Strange is basically a story based game very much in the vein of Telltale games like The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us. What differs Life is Strange from those games in that the setting is far more down to earth and mundane, which actually in my mind, counts as a huge strength. Every single one of us has experienced being a young person and dealing with problems, both big and small, in life. I consider this a strength as the story is so much more relatable and immersive. The player character, Max Caulfield, is likeable and easy to relate with. She finds herself in instantly recognisable situations and feels familiar emotions. On the surface, it would seem the opposite. Yet, in keeping within the realms of reality (apart from the time travelling mechanic of course) the characters and plot lines are so much easier to idenity with. To compare with The Walking Dead, the choices there concern such abstract situations in comparison. The vast majority of people never have to act in life or death situations, to kill people or make choices in harsh moral situations. Life is Strange's story is of such familiarity, that the themes are far more intriguing. We've all had to deal with difficult things in regards to growing up. What we want to do in life, who our friends are, the trials and tribulations of education, wishing we could make different decisions and interacting with people. This is the best strength of the game in my opinion.\n\nThe other mechanic that sets it apart from the rest is the time travelling mechanic. It allows for some really amazing plot scenarios and works very well in the concept of your choices mattering. Never mind having to make the initial choice, seeing the consequences and being able to go back in time adds a whole new layer to the system. Again, this initially seems like a bad idea but it works very well in practice. As the story progresses, it has a bigger and bigger impact. No spoilers though, experience it for yourself.\n\nI'd also like to heap particular accolades on the audio/visual department. The graphics and art style do an excellent job of conveying a dream-like, surreal state. The environment looks superb, especially the vivid sunsets and rays of light. The sound is well done, with the voice actors being of high quality. The music is well-chosen and fitting to the atmosphere of the game. The only complaint I have in this department is that the DOF and blur effects are sometimes a bit overdone but that may be my personal preference.\n\nOverall, I can't reccommend this game enough. One of the best story based games I've played, with a huge emotional punch to it. I can't wait for the finale of the story.","August 26, 2015","true","14.8"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","16","19","2","3"

The visuals, the characters, the soundtrack, the choices - everything ties together beautifully, and painfully. I've a lot of love for this game, that it's unreal.\n\nWithout repeating what many others have said - if you like adventure games, that are story rich, puzzle light, with characters who will stay with you long after you've completed it, with great voice acting and a great soundtrack - both ambient and where songs are used, then this is for you. The mechanics are quite unique and give a true thrill of what you are doing, and the ability to really make choices - if you don't like a choice, you can go back. Your choices aren't rushed, which in turn makes them more painful at times, but all the more worthy.\n\nIt's a rollercoaster of a ride, there are some weak spots, but even with those - the beauty of the game, just being in the moments it provides makes up for slower progression, or clunky puzzles. I loved just being in this game, soaking up the atmosphere, which is something I've found in very few games.\n\nWhile I picked this up on sale - it is worth the full price, without any doubt. If you like the narrative focussed Tell Tale games of late (Walking Dead, etc) then, definitely buy this.","October 21, 2015","true","17.4"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skippylou/recommended/319630/","Skippylou","-{RED}- Skiptomylou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skippylou/","447 products in account","Just to begin with, this game hit me with chills right before the credits rolled for episode one.  I want to say this is comparable to a Telltale game but, honestly, the writing and narrative style can't be compared.  However, if you enjoy episodic video games you'll probably enjoy Life is Strange.  I've heard it has a similar feel to Gone Home, but I can't comment on that myself.\n\nSo what can you expect with Life Is Strange?  After the first episode I can say that I hope you can expect meaningful choices that matter.  I would be supremely dissapointed in this title if your choices didn't really affect the overall narrative.  A core aspect of this game is the rewind system and I'm hoping that it was put there for reasons other than an "oopsie" button.  It does feel like the rewind system has more purpose than to drive the narrative but we can only wait and see.\n\nYou may notice this game looks hipster as ♥♥♥♥.  You probably aren't wrong and the pop-culture references do get a little old but they fit the characters and the story.  They don't feel tacked in at all.  Hey, we were all high schoolers once.  Or maybe you still are.  At any rate, we can all relate.  But if you don't want to play Tumblr: The Game, you may want to stay away.  In a way, it's like playing an indie movie.  The characters are well written, the dialogue is superb and I was hit with the "Donnie Darko" feeling the entire time.\n\nIf you're on the fence, watch some youtube videos.  Not TOO much!  And if you're still on the fence just buy one episode to start out with.  But I really look forward to how this series unfolds.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalterkrist/recommended/319630/","kalterkrist","ButterySmooth14FPS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalterkrist/","133 products in account","This review is based on episodes 1 through 5. Life is Strange is an absolutely fantastic experience that I would readily recommend to those who already enjoy Telltale-style decision games, as well as newcomers to the genre. When compared against similar Telltale offerings, I would say that the impact/emotional weight of the choices in Life is Strange is a clear cut above the competition, though I did have some minor gripes regarding episode 5's culmination. The sheer brilliance of the narrative shines through with the game's rewind mechanic - while the idea may seem like cheating at first, it quickly becomes apparent that there is never a clearly 'correct' choice to make and you may find yourself rewinding upwards of three times, still uncertain of how to proceed. Max Caulfield is a strong, likable, and well-defined heroine, and the player will doubtless feel a connection with her and her situation as the game progresses.\n\nThe game has a distinct art style that is very appealing, from character designs down to the font used for interactions. The soundtrack is nothing short of brilliant - both the original score and assortment of licensed indie tracks that comprise it suit the world of Life is Strange wonderfully. Although the voice acting can be shaky for some minor characters, and the dialogue sometimes seems forced, Max and Chloe's voice actresses deliver some of the most convincing and emotional performances I have ever heard in gaming. Ashly Burch did an impeccable job as Chloe, and her performance in later episodes is simply astounding. The narrative itself is impressive, ranging from everyday problems that teenagers experience to some very dark and mature themes, all handled remarkably tastefully and in an uncontrived manner.\n\nA consistent strength of Life is Strange's gameplay is the freedom to walk around and interact with others at your will--often allowing you to learn about various characters' inner struggles and also attempt to befriend them--as well as optionally examine objects throughout the environment. Doing so allows the player to get some insight into Max's inner thoughts, and also provides you with information/the ability to perform minor actions that may prove pivotal later in the story. Commendably, many characters with whom you interact often left me confused as to whether I can trust them, or whether they are good people. Having that sense of doubt when choosing a course of action that could implicate someone adds weight to the decisions you are making. In various places throughout the game, Max may sit down, providing time for introspection. These are some of the most beautiful moments in the game - the acoustic guitar-laden music and camera angles all accentuate these brief scenes where Max contemplates the world before her.\n\nThe consequences of multiple decisions are made clear quite early in the game, and new gameplay considerations are introduced that will take the player by surprise. The climactic sequences of most episodes resonated with me greatly, sometimes making me feel extremely vulnerable or agonized, and always left me in dire anticipation of the next episode. Although the consequences in the game are generally quite meaningful early on, episode 5 falls a bit short of expectations - though it is by no means a weak ending. Still very impactful, the final episode has what I believe to be some of the best sequences and dialogue in the entire game. Ultimately, the series proved to be an emotional experience that captures the essence of teenage struggles remarkably well. While some of the puzzle solving in Life is Strange leaves something to be desired (certain segments are tedious instead of creative), the game's gorgeous art, strong character interactions, beautiful indie soundtrack, and overall atmosphere excel, ensnaring the player deep into its unique world. I look forward to seeing what Dontnod has in store for us in the future.","February 5","true","21.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Probably one of the best in a while.\n☺ The story is unique and easy to follow.\n☺ The thing I loved the most about this game was the characters. Once in a while you really want to connect with your protagonist in a special way. You know, laughing and enjoying the moment as she does, crying your eyes out when everything just goes to hell. The determination she's feeling. Just feeling this rollercoaster of emotions.\n☺ You get to decide your faith! Ofcourse, it's not all on you but when you have the opportunity to choose - naturally the entertainment value of the game raises. At least in my eyes.\n☺ Very stylized. It might not have the best graphics but the world it potrays has been done extremely well.","April 24","true","24.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Episode 5 completely ruined it for me. The amount of loose ends and the ultimately weak ending (either of the two possible endings) were so underwhelming it made me wish I'd never played Episode 5 because being stuck at a plot twist cliffhanger would be better than this. It is just painfully disappointing how Episode 5 turned out considering the hype at the end of Episode 4, and it's not that I want to ignore how amazing the game was in the first four episodes, but unfortunately the ending is what counts.","October 20, 2015","false","15.7"," 232 of 415 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","232","415","3","21"

The only thing that LiS failed to do was to put me on tears with the ending. Other than that, the execution, overall story, format and gameplay was waaaaaaaay better than walking dead. Also I absolutely loved the angles and shots they made, they managed to convey the story just by framing of the shots. Literally taking the quote "A Picture is worth a thousand words".\n\nAlso this game features time manipulation. Usually it is very hard to make a story let alone tell it to not be confusing with this topic, but dontnod handled it easily and even with multiple time jumps near the end, they didn't make the story difficult.\n\nAlso I managed to juggle 2 game saves, having 2 distinct and opposite role playing behavior. It didn't felt boring and a meaningless chore because every choice or decision will have an impact on the game, I tried to do this with walking dead before, and I hated it and wasn't able to continue with the playstyle until the end.\nUnfortunately, even though there are multiple variations on the events, the game's ending was the lowest part of the game. There are only 2 ENDINGS ON THE GAME. I basically got all the ending with my 2 save games.\n\nThis game could have been a 10/10 to me, but with the limited ending, I will drop a point and rate this 9/10.

The setting is fun, the characters are interesting enough, the game play is unique, the story is intriguing with some interesting turns, and the game does a good job of reminding you of previous choices in a meaningful way (though whether or not that means they "matter" is debatable, but I'll get to that later). Some of the choices feel arbitrary (i.e. you're given several choices, with one of them giving a good result and the others giving a bad one, with little to no indication of which is which, forcing you to guess and check), the collection aspect doesn't really amount to anything, and the dialogue options often feel like variations of the same statement (as opposed to Telltale games, where even insignificant dialogue options at least make you feel like you're making a choice, however small), but the game is still generally enjoyable. I'd give the game a 7/10.\n\nI would, but...\n\nSPOILERS:\n\nThe endings to this game are some of the worst I've ever seen in a story-driven game. It makes David Cage games look like masterpieces. Effectively, the entire ending boils down to a single choice, and all previous choices don't matter. No, I don't just mean "the ending isn't affected by previous choices". I mean "The ending completely undoes all previous choices". Either all the characters except you and your best friend die (effectively undoing all interactions you had with the other characters), or you go back in time and don't save your friend or use your powers (literally undoing the events of the entire game). Both endings leave tons of loose ends and plot holes (including why the powers exist in the first place and why they inexplicably cause things to go wrong), and both of them are the exact opposite of satisfying. The moral of this particular story feels like "Life sucks and the universe actively hates you for no real reason". The game might as well have said "It was all just a dream"; your choices would have had just as much impact on the world.\n\nAfter seeing how the game ends, I give the game a 4.5/10. I did enjoy it enough, but the ending doesn't just feel lazy; It feels intentionally bad.","January 2","false","10.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

Withing the first few monutes, however, I knew that I am going to enjoy these episodes. The Time rewinding mechnic is a lot of fun and makes your choices that more complicated rather than easier. The characters introduced in episode 1 are very much alive and each have thier own lives, opinions and storied for you to look into and comment on or ignore. The soundtrack adds so much to the game that makes me more connected to both the world and Max and I cannot help but become attached to Max having access to her thoughts and personality. She deals with the struggles of college life which are prominent in both our own lives and movies and it is interting to deal with them with this time rewinding mechinic. I can only hope that the pure fantastic atmosphere and storys continues through the episodes and I cannot wait to see if my choices have doomed or saved realtionships in the future. Time may have felt like it was on my side, but only time can tell me whether  I have made some terrible choices.\n\nEpisode 2 :- After the cliffhanger of 1, I was wondering how the world would have changed. Well, more like how much Max's world would have changed. We see more of Chloe and have a seemingly pointless fetch quest in the middle of the episode (involving beer bottles) but while fetching these bojects you stumble upon some more story about Chloes life and her realtionship with Rachel and also hearing Max's thoughts on leaving Chloe behind. However, Chloe really takes a back seat for what is really an episode that deals with another character that was introduced in Episode 1. The episode is much harder hitting and your choices from episode 1 will come and hit you in the gut here if you have made some wrong ones, and when the episode closes you will either feel like a Hero or feel helpless. Rewinding time cannot help you all the time, and Max's ability can only go back so far. Either way, if episodes continue like this, we are going to be in for one hella ride.","March 24, 2015","true","15.2"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","22","33","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/recommended/319630/","snortcannon","Snort Cannon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/","1320 products in account","This review is for the entire season of Life Is Strange.\n\nEpisode 1:\nLife is Strange is an episodic adventure game made by Dontnod studios from the same people that made Remember Me. In Life is Strange we play as Max. Max is a teenager at blackwater acedamy where she is studying photography but one day she witnesses a murder and finds out she can rewind time to a certain point to change the consequences. So how is Life Is Strange episode 1 ? This game is really good and Telltale has found its worthy rival. The game looks incredibly good and the soundtrack is very good as well. The game would be a mix of Gone Home and The walking dead and the story is very intriguing. The game still has 4 episodes to go and i cant wait to see how this thing wraps up. There are a few problems i find with this game. I dont like that you can rewind time to choose a diffrent option for a major choice. It kinda makes me feel that the choices i made were meaningless and if i didnt like em i could just rewind and choose a diffrent option. Overall Life Is Strange is a fantastic adventure and without a  doubt if you like adventure games where youre choices matter get this game straight away. I give Life Is Strange Episode 1 a 8/10\n\nEpisode 2:\nThis is where the story picks up. We understand how to control our powers and we try to use them for good but we start to find weird stuff happening around us. The first episode was a slow start just to establish the characters episode 2 is where the story picks up and gives us more tougher choices to make. I don't want to spoil what's gonna happen so i'll just say if you haven't bought this game, go do it now cause episode 2 is amazing. I give Episode 2 a 9/10\n\nEpisode 3:\nWow. I am really impressed how every episode gets better. This episode is about more puzzle solving and I can't say I don't like it. Simply put it episode 3 is the best episode so far. The story in this episode is really well written. The story picks up as soon as episode 2 ends and we are tasked to find out who is behind the disappearance of Rachael. There is something wrong with this episode which I don't like. I found a lot of bugs like Max not picking up certain items and the rewind ability not stopping when i try to stop it. Overall if you haven't checked out Life Is Strange you need to do that straight away. I give Episode 3 a 9.5/10\n\nEpisode 4:\nI'm literally speechless. Episode 4 is a nail bitter from start to finish. The wait was worth it and without a doubt Episode 4 is by far the best episode (notice a pattern yet ?). Ep 4 begins straight away after episode 3. Max is tasked to put every clue together to find out what happened to Rachael and Kate. I really can't go into detail about this cause I will ruin the entire plot. The story this time doesn't take any breaks. Everything wrong that could happen does happen and also this episode has a very shocking ending. The previous episode had a lot of puzzle solving but this one has even more. You have to think a lot and put together a lot of clues like a detective. This episode by far is fantastic and without a doubt I can't wait to see how the entire story wraps up. I will say episode 4 is perfect every possible. This game is a must own. I give Episode 4 Dark Room a 9.5/10\n\nEpisode 5:\n\nAfter finishing the final episode of Life Is Strange I felt a bitter sweet feeling. I knew I did what needed to be done, but it also felt like what I did was wrong. When the ending scene started playing, I noticed how my heart started sinking and I knew that this one experience I will never forget.\n\nEpisode 5 is a no stop shop. All you did in the previous episodes comes back to haunt you in every way possible. It makes you feel that the choices you made were wrong and everything that went wrong was your fault.\n\nThe ending at one glance is a very disappointing finisher, because it makes you feel that everything you did in the previous episodes didn't matter in the end, but trust me this isn't the case.\n\nLife Is Strange is one experience I can't recommend enough. This game is a must play for everyone. The heartbreaking story is absolutely amazing. This game should be considered for a GOTY award.\n\nThis journey was incredible and I loved every waking moment.

Gameplay is like The Walking Dead, with a scenario as confusing as Bioshock Infinite, and nice cool teenagers as protagonists.\nThe whole game (5 episodes) is more than 10-12 hours long so it's a really good price-money ratio if you loved the genre.\nIn other terms, if you played The Walking Dead series and likes it, this should be a game to try too ;).\n\n+ like for all these games, if you master English, do not put the subtitles in your -other- native language ;), it's was better this way.\n\nAnyway, a five star game for me, definitely among the 10 best I've ever played, 96% Positive Reviews, that doesn't lie here on Steam ;).","February 10","true","15.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/319630/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","Note: I deleted my initial review and have rewritten it.\n\nLife is Strange, developed by Dontnod Entertainment that contains five episodes, is a story-driven game dependant on choices of the player. This game is set in Arcardia Bay. You, the player, play as Maxine Caulfield, who is an aspiring photographer that has just been accepted into Blackwell Academy. This game in a nutshell, is just absolutely incredible. The many elements of artwork to the dialogue to the environment makes this a game that must be played. I will discuss the story, the artwork, the dialogue, sound and negatives of the game in a condensed review.\n\nThe story of Life is Strange is phenomenal primarily due to the choices that the player has to make. These choices you decide twist the story completely that it makes things emotional within such a short playtime of the overall game. There are several stories in the game that there are several main stories, not just one, and there are an abundance of side missions that affect the main story. There are many games where side quests do not matter in relation to the main story. However, in this game you will know that the majority of your decisions will mean something in the end. For choices that do not overly matter, your choice is compared to all other players that have made decisions through percentages. This is quite comparable to The Walking Dead series by Telltale with the choices and what players globally chose. This game most importantly that I do commend the developers for is how important your choices matter for the end game. Here are minor spoilers but all your choices throughout the episodes culminate into various cutscenes in episode five that lead up to the final scene, therefore, I do love this aspect because it questions the players choices from decisions throughout all episodes. Also, little things like Maxines journals and texts on her phone added some context to the various stories occuring in the game, which I liked because it was such a little thing that mattered. Overall, the story is simple, relatable, and very effective. It captures the modern time of students going to College, well in some aspects.\n\nThe artwork in this game is excellent. The artwork again is best compared to The Walking Dead series with sketch-based drawings. The artwork is just beautiful. All characters are distinct in their design and all are accompanied by various traits. This adds into the story of choices because all characters have different personalities, which add variety of dialogue and art. The artwork captures the emotions in characters depending on events that have happened in the game. For example, the diverse personalities of characters made a very emotional scene intensify as you had the bullies that did not overly care but showed some ounce of compassion while others were extremely sad. In other words, the artwork of characters captured their personalities with the various events in the game.\n\nThe environment, scenery, and atmosphere are beautiful. Yes, I am overly commending this game but this game deserves all the praise it recieves. The environment is beautiful. All of the artwork complements the areas that the game progresses through. Visuals are expressed elegantly like the Tornado and Arcardia Bay, allowing the player to further invest themselves into the city and events happening.\n\nThe soundtrack captures the essence of the game as it progresses. Small things like Maxine walking down the hall at school playing music from her phone to bigger things like the music when a major event occurs showcases the variety of severity in all decisions and events in the game. Alternatively, the soundtrack complements the environment and atmosphere.\n\nThe voice acting is very strong. The voice acting fits the personalities of the characters and adds to the story. My only gripe is the lack of variety in voice tones with some characters. When there is a very emotional scene occuring, there would be minimal transition in a character's voice tone. That is only small but the voice acting for the most part was very good.\n\nThere were very minor issues with the game. I experienced some rare unstable framerates with the FPS dropping from around 60-35, which would make the cutscene slightly unstable, but for the most part this was very minor.\n\nA side comment I will make. I posted a negative comment in the first review. I stated that in episode one I didn't like the basic nature of the game due to a lack in building in relationships. For example, I stated that my decisions on Kate did not affect her at all, such as defending her in a situation did not matter by the end of episode one. However, I will clarify that whatever decision I make throughout the game will pop up in some way or form, so decisions do matter - I want to emphasise this.\n\nAnother negative in Life is Strange is the basicness of the game. For one, it is through the lack of builiding on relationships. As a player, I would have loved to know how much decisions impacted the story and what its relations on people were. For example, I defended Kate in her situations and was a good friend to her, but at the end of the game, it made no difference on my decisions affecting her. I felt this takes away from the game.\n\nOverall, this game is a masterpiece. Just an absolute great game with the overwhemingly positive story and the other aspects like artwork and the soundtrack that complement the story. Just exceptional and I highly recommend this game at full price. 10/10 for the full series.\n\nThanks for reading my review!

What can I say ? Awesome story, great and interesting characters, the soundtrack is just PERFECT from Syd Matters to the Foals, super immersive experience, it really felt like I was actually in the game !\nI've played it two times, and I enjoyed every part of it. My only regret the first time was that  I couldn't save Kate and it made me so sad. :'(\n\nNow the downside of the game (it was still a perfect gaming experience for me nevertheless) : I didn't find the last episode as good as the others. It began in a really good way, then it got a bit boring (the nightmare part was a little too long for my taste) and in the end, no matter what choices you made, you'll end up picking one of the only two possible endings.\nThe first time I decided to sacrifice Chloe. This ending was made in such a beautiful way, I was still crying about it weeks after I've finished it. Then I wanted to see what the other ending looked like... And what a disappointment. Way shorter than the other, we don't really see a lot happening because they just leave the city not even wondering if Joyce, Warren or the others might still be alive... Weird.\n\nOther than that Dontnod made a reaaaaally good job with this game, it was realistic, and there are many references here and there it's always funny to see. The incredibly good voice acting gets you even more into it.  Chloe's voice in the Junkyard scene completely broke my heart. :( One thing I particularly loved is all these moments where you can just sit somewhere, relax and listen to Max's thoughts and the wonderful music while looking at beautiful sceneries. *-*\n\nSo yes, this game is a straight 1000/10 for me, will play it again for sure. ♥","May 31","true","40.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Would you fix your mistakes? There is only one catch, fixing your mistakes might cause severe problems in the future. This is the basic premise behind Life is Strange, a charming adventure game from DontNod Entertainment, where mistakes are a trial run and friendships last forever.\n\nSet in the idyllic seaside town of Arcadia Bay, the story centres around two great friends who are searching for a missing girl. To find her, they will use a time-rewind ability that allows you to change conversations and solve non-linear puzzles. You play as Max Caulfield, a softly-spoken photography student, who is joined by her best friend Chloe Price, a rebellious teenager. Together they experience joy and sorrow across 12-15 hours of memorable adventuring in five substantial episodes.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, it is most similar to the Telltale games. This means lots of conversations and basic puzzles. But rewinding time changes things for the better, and is used cleverly in some of the earlier episodes. It also has some exquisitely crafted scenes with brilliant camera angles and compositions. Also worth mentioning is the charming music, featuring slow guitar strumming and gentle voices, perfect for those emotional moments. Lip-syncing is really the biggest disappointment, not up to standard for a game with this much dialogue. It also needed more voice actors.\n\nAside from these minor pitfalls, DontNod Entertainment has crafted an endearing, time-bending and memorable adventure with Life is Strange. It takes players on a quirky sci-fi adventure through time and space as they uncover the truth. It will be hard to forget the special moments these two great friends share.\n\nRead the full review[www.newgamenetwork.com]","October 27, 2015","true","23.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

While I have yet to play Episode 3 and 4 (Only up to Episode 4 was available at the time of writing this review), just from my experience in Episodes 1 and 2, basically drew me into the game. The game is really fun to play, with great plot development which kept me sitting here for quite a while. This is one of the games where I actually care about the characters, as they did such a great job with the character developent, and the basic plotline.\n\nWould I recommend this game?\nYes, definitely, if you have the money to spend, and want a nice, and fun game (with some feels hidden here and there) this game is a must buy.","August 5, 2015","true","16.9"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ABudiJ/recommended/319630/","ABudiJ","Budi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ABudiJ/","301 products in account","Life Is Strange tells the tale of a young photography student Max. She has just started in her new school. Things are already complicated for her but her life takes a strange twist when she gets the power to travel back in time.\n\nMax can only rewind for a few minutes and this is also a gameplay mechanic to be used in puzzles and choices in dialogue. It's really interesting mechanic and it makes the game standout from other modern adventure games. Even though it bothers me a bit that Max always comments when time could or should be rewinded. It would be more fun to figure out these things myself. Also sometimes the story forces you in time more than just few minutes.\n\nThere's plenty of things to look at and interact with, for example posters and notes. Or you can just chill for awhile and play some guitar or sit at the fountain on the schoolyard. There are many characters you can have dialogue with, however those conversations aren't unfortunately very long. But many of the characters were really interesting with their own backstories and mysteries. When you make choices in the game, it will notify in the upright corner "this action will have consequences". Unfortunately these choices very rarely affect the game in the long run. In the end you have two choices to pick the ending from. But that being said, every choice you make is part of your personal story. You made the choice and it happened. Just because they don't affect the ending cinematic they shouldn't be disregarded. As they say, it's about the journey not the destionation.\n\nGame uses Unreal engine and looks quite nice except for the sometimes horrendous lip sync. There are 5 episodes and they are 3 hours in lenght on average. Personally im not a big fan of the style of soundtrack in the game, but it fits the game and the scenes perfectly. Storytelling is really strong, it paints a great picture of the characters and throws some interesting twists in the mix.\n\n\n\n[Score: 88]","February 18, 2015","true","16.4"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","15","21","3","0"

As I play through the rest of the episodes, I will adjust the review accordingly, and will archive past impressions in the comment section.\n\n\nSo, episode two.\n\nObviously, the pacing was better with the second episode, as it should be, since the major, initial character development was no longer necessary.\n\nThis one focused more on providing a solid direction for the plot to follow. The rewind feature was less prominent, but the story itself took the front seat and ran with it.\n\nThis isnt to say the rewind feature was non-existent. Quite the opposite. It was used often. It was however used more as a story device and less as a unique feature.\n\nSo, this episode featured some tough choices and one definitely story changing arc depending on how you handled a specific scenario. Surprisingly so actually. The variation should cause some increasingly divergant experiences for players through the remaining episodes.\n\nAnyway, I thought the pacing was better, the characters were obviously more familiar, and yet some of the ideas you probably had from episode one will be shattered or at least make you revisit your past assumptions. I found that to be both interesting and compelling.\n\nSo, where I thought the first episode was okay with a lot of promise, I thought episode two was actually really good and continued to keep you interested throughout. It also encourages you to at least playthrough it twice given the very, incredibly different possibilities that come from a single event in the story.\n\nI will eagerly await episode three to see what happens next.","January 31, 2015","true","7.7"," 45 of 77 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","45","77","3","9"

We see the same feelings we get from the atmosphere of Remember Me, in this game. A perfectly created world.\n\nGraphics are in a different style. Nor a Borderlands or Telltale style neither realistic.\nThat gorgeous world is benefited from this design choice. This pastel coloured world is created so brilliantly that; characters/world doesn't seem synthetic even though they don't have 9999999 polygons.\n\nAgain, same as Remember Me. This, too is filled with great musics. I hope DONTNOD keeps making gam-...art forever.\n\nI won't talk about the story to avoid giving spoilers, it was good.\n\nNow; the most important parts.. Are our choices really matter? Does the time rewinding stuff really works?\n\nAs the devs said; choices are mattering both in short/long terms. We'll see the long term on next episodes, but I can confirm that short term choices were more than enough. Moreover; game is filled with minor choices everywhere.\n\n--- spoiler ---\nSPOILER WARNING: These both pictures I'm linking are %100 spoilers. They're the summary of my choices in game. So don't click it if you didn't played the game yet.\nminor choices:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=383976592\n\nmajor choices:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=383976558\n--- spoiler ---\n\n\nTime rewind is working great too. (Here comes the spoilers again)\n\n--- spoiler ---\nFor an example; your character gets asked a question in the lecture. Since you don't know, you can't answer. After; someone else answers the question. Aaaand.. here comes time rewind.. Now you'll have the answer in the dialogue choices.\n--- spoiler ---\n\nIn most situations; you don't need time rewinding; yet you CAN do it, to change the outcome.\nThere's also no "game over". Did you do something wrong?.. Do you wish to revert a choice? Then go time rewind and revert it :)\n\n\nAlso.. most important thing about the game.. It has working mirrors. As in ""real-life-reflecting mirrors". Not "oh-so-mirror-not static-images"\n\nAgain, DONTNOD and Square Enix didn't failed me. 10/10, can be GOTY.","January 30, 2015","true","28.6"," 33 of 55 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","33","55","3","2"

With such a predictable conclusion; and especially any lack of either closure for the series or set-up for more LiS content (whether it would be another Episode or Entire Season), LiS never reaches the heights that it should ultimately ascend to.\n\nWith such an excellent premise, Max (our playable heroine) embarks on a jouney of finding out she - and you, as the player - have the power to manipulate time to find out information & even change events from actually ever occuring - which is absolutely awesome, as both a storyline hook & as a gameplay mechanic. Experimentation with the time-manipulation mechanic can often feel fun, rewarding, interesting, intriguing, nerve-wracking, and/or daunting depending on the situation at hand.\n\nSet in a High School, important themes of how people (especially teenagers) are often treated and behave are front-and-center here, as you will make decisions (often, many of them have a lot of weight) will change the actual journey itself of how the game plays out. Not only this, but there's the story of a girl who went missing that Max and her life-long friend Chloe are trying to find. Unraveling the mystery of the missing girl, experience the journey, and making lots of decisions is - well, for the most part - is fantastic.\n\nLike Mass Effect 3, Life Is Strange still should be played & not missed for its fantastic journey though-out all of Episodes 1-4 and most of Episode 5. The journey is absolutely fantastic and should be experienced for that alone, even if the conclusion to LiS is one of the most epic disappointments since the conclusion of Mass Effect 3 (base-game).\n\nFor more details and my thoughts...\n...On this series, look at my thoughts of Life Is Strange in two places in my Steam Groups:\n\nEpisodes 1-4:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/TGAEC/discussions/0/530647080133925863/\n\nEpisode 5 in particular:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/TGAEC/discussions/0/483367798520665015/","October 20, 2015","true","17.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

So I wait until the last chapter was released and now I can absolutely tell you that all my expectations were achieved in this amazing game. =D\n\nYou are Max, a young photography student that has the ability to come back in time, and you will face many tough questions of life in your journey like crimes, drugs, bullying, the search for our own identity, friendship, death, and other life subjects of teens and young adults on your way to live your life in the most correct way, as you always had lived.\n\nThe excellence of the game shines through some very important aspects:\n\n1 - the interactive narrative that always give us options to explore and advance in a unique way, with a great tree of decisions and consequences (choose wisely...);\n\n2 - the amazing characters in the world, each one with a complete background story that we know as the game goes on;\n\n3 - the totally awesome voice acting, that give us the ambience and the mood in every situation;\n\n4 - the cool music and the sounds that keep us immersive in the world and in each scene.\n\n5 - lots of notes and texts to give a more tridimensional view of the places, the people and our own choices and consequences.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple and works like charm like it is expected. The graphics and art style are also simple, in a celshading-like effect that I personally liked very much and works great to transmit the ambience of the game.\n\nThe only down point for me was a few puzzles that you can say the right thing always. It was a bit boring make a mistake in the end of the conversation and lose it all. I liked more the puzzles that we had to explore the scenery and use the power to change the situation and complete the goal.\n\nIn the end, I enjoyed it so much, and if you like a good interactive narrative, great story, excellent characters and a total immersion in a game and its problems (as much as I like) you MUST play Life is Strange. Certainly this game became one of my favorites of all time. ❤","November 1, 2015","true","17.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

I feel like with a lot of games like this, no matter what you choose you'll get the same major outcome only slightly different. Often in this game every different option can cause an entire different outcome. Most notably in episode 2 when it's actually possible to not save Kate. The story can be a bit melodramatic as you’re dealing with a bunch of private school teenagers and the dialogue can feel a bit forced but overall it draws you in and makes you want to know what is going to happen. Honestly can’t wait for the rest of the season to come out. The one thing I wish this game had was a lot more save slots since there’s so many different options and paths you can take. Overall 8/10. Will update when the rest of the episodes hit.","March 30, 2015","true","23.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","2"

Only if you find everything presented about this game as being very off-putting should you even consider waiting around for a discount. This really needs to be experienced. Especially if you love the Pacific Northwest and great stories set in them, like X-Files and Twin Peaks.\n\nOver the last few years, a lot of games had some story and some originality, but to many of us a few particular titles seemed rather pretentious. Or, rather, those heaping far more praise on the titles than they deserved seemed to be pretentious. Attempting to impress by affecting greater importance, talent, culture... than is actually possessed.\n\nIt isn't that all of these other games have been awful. In fact, many have been decent and enjoyable. They just did not seem to be the great revelation or evolution to gaming. Walking simulators (a label I do not use pejoratively) were slobbered over and deemed to be great leaps in story telling. When viewed more objectively, they seemed to only have good stories "for a game". A couple of story beats climaxing, in one particular game, in a twist that left some falling all over themselves, others ranting angrily about "agendas" and the rest of us shaking our heads, thinking "that's it?". In particular, I think it was easy for people who saw "agendas" in those games to do so, because there was so little other meat on the bown.\n\nLife Is Strange is like those games in that it chases what they tried to chase. It addresses growth in gaming and story telling that reviewers of those games said we all wanted.  However, where those games often felt fairly empty and usually only had stories that were good with a qualified statement, like "for a game", Dontnod comes out with a game that delivers on fulfilling all these things.\n\nIf one can accuse Gone Home of being pretentious (though I assert it is less the game which is pretentious, but a certain type of fawning reviewer who was), Life Is Strange is genuine. It is full of interesting characters, compelling story, fantastic cinematics, great atmosphere, and a sense of intrigue behind everyone and everything. After the enjoyable but flawed Remember Me, Dontnod comes back with a game that steps up to the free-style indie gaming rap battle and answers Gone Home's every criticism meaningfully and drops the mic.\n\nI can not wait for episode two. There are so many things I want answers to. And I want to know if Nathan is really such a creep (and if so, do we get a chance to avenge Chloe?). This story and world really follows up on its influences like Twin Peaks, X-Files, Haven, Gone Home, and runs with those along with the real Pacific Northwest churn beneath everything.\n\nNot to mention, this teaches Telltale a thing or two. The game has an appealing and simple interface and the engine is just gorgeous. I would play other stories in this if they licensed it out to other devs.\n\nShould you buy this? Unless you are terribly off-put by it, yes. It is not a challenging game. It is very casual. But it is extremely enjoyable. I wouldn't even bother waiting for a discount. Buy it now. Play it now (the first episode is around three hours). And then eagerly await the next one.","January 31, 2015","true","17.7"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","28","46","2","4"

I barely followed this game since it was announced, and its release came as a surprise to me, but after reading lots of reviews and user opinions I decided to give it a try, and man was it worth it.\n\nIt may seem a bit storeotypical at first glance, but as the story progresses it really finds it own personalty. I'm very fond of narrative-driven games and Life is Strange is definitely a very good one. The story is interesting, the characters (although typical at first) are well written, and the time reversal mechanic gives the game the defining feature it needed not to be another "Telltale-esque" wannabe. Also, all the decisions you make really seem to impact a lot of variables (way deeper than Mass Effect's Red-Blue system), I am really interested on seeing how it all develops in the future.\n\nOn a bad note, the puzzles are really straight-forward and easy, but I guess that will change as the next Episodes keep coming. For now, the plot holds well and has my interest.","January 31, 2015","true","16.2"," 29 of 48 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","29","48","0","1"

I could write something really analytical, even pretentious; that just goes on and on about symbolism and themes and what it all means and how I really felt. I could defend what people see as flaws, but I'm just gonna do something a lot simpler.\n\nThis is a great game. It's not perfect, there are definitely moments that can detract, but it's all about perspective. It's really the kind of experience you have to draw personal connections to, really get emotionally involved with. It's the first thing in a long time that really made me question what I wanted to do in a game on the basis of morality or doing what I felt was right for the player character. The music is very often wistful, and carries emotion and sentiment that fits well. The art style is pleasing, although i can't say much for the actual graphics since I had to play on all low excepting texture size(although I still didnt mind the look of anything in the game honestly). The writing is good, but dialogue can have some questionable elements. The game tries to tiptoe between pop culture references and humor that reflect both classical approaches to subcultures, and the sort of "hipster, millenial" vibe that Max and Chloe have going on. In the former, the game is very well aware of what it's doing, so nothing feels out of place, but when it comes to the latter, the instances in which these sort of interactions are placed just feel... off. They feel badly timed and poorly considered, and compromise the majority of what I think would cause people to feel detachment from the game. Despite that, I was definitely able to connect to a good deal of the characters and I felt like there was a lot of closure in individual character development. I wish the game could have shown more in the end, but I have no problem with keeping things ambigous either. As Chloe asked Max whether or not she thought (Go watch Bladerunner.) Deckard was a replicant and recieved no reply, I feel as if no hard reply to a great many questions you could ask is necessary. All in all, Life is Strange is definitely a unique experience, and one that for it's ups and downs, I'm happy to have played. There's even more to say about it, but I think if you read this much, we should either discuss those on our own or you should play the game since you haven't already.","November 20, 2015","true","22.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","6"

Not so often does a game give you a roller coaster of emotions and feelings and keeps with you after you finish it. I was blown away by everything. The story is awesome, but Sqaure Enix knows how to connect feelings, story, characters and music into a mind blowing game. Normally I only hear hip-hop and most of time I play games like CS:GO or League of Legends and I guess I never had to cry because of a movie, but this game held me awake because after every episode I seriously didn’t know how control  my feelings, yes sometimes I was very close to some tears and I always thought „how will the story continue“? What´s next? The story was awesome, and thanks to god it wasn’t prescient and it’s over now.

I do not want to spoil anything as it really is a touching experience, but I guarantee that you will be moved by the characters' problems, because we can all relate to them. Suffice to say, we all knew or know someone dealing with drugs, depression, bullying (including social media), step-father issues, a person/friend gone missing, love and financial problems, and true friendship.\nThe game showcases these everlasting notions we face even now.\n\nThe choices we make in the game do matter and what we don't say or actions we ignore, will manifest themselves in the next episode; often with deadly repercussions. We cannot rewind time in our daily lives, try to experience what if we could change the decisions we make and see what will (would) happen. Chaos Theory at its best.\n\nI honestly, and me being a gamer for 22 years, can give this game a 10/10. They say a 10 is a game without flaws and I see no reason that it shouldn't be considered as one:\n\nGraphics - outstanding, the attention to detail even when characters are crying is phenomenal and the environment is so believable that it remembered me of my high school days (placement of bins, lockers, people chatting about school problems, love problems, making plans for the weekend, a football game on Friday)\n\nAudio - in conjunction with the video aspect it fits perfectly. Dormitories sound like dormitories, school talk is so good that you can stand for 5 minutes in the corridor and feel the youth we all experienced (or we are about to).\n\nDialogues and Story - with graphics making everything so real and music creating the substantial environment of high school; the dialogues finish it off with a bang. Christian Davine and Jean-Luc Cano nailed it with teenage jargon (LoL, wowser, hashtags, sexting, Facebooking etc.) and creating a story that grips you from the moment you reverse time for the . . . first time.\nI hoped I delivered the message and haven't spoiled anything.\n\nThe game is cheap for the value it offers - buy it and you will not be disappointed.

There isn't any option to glass them nor can you call them out on their bs.\n\nHave a look at the game's store page again, it says "Multiple endings depending on the choices you make" in the features section, which is definitely not the case. (intertesting thing is that it is about the only thing which can be objectively verified, because all other things can be considered subjective and vary in interpretation from person to person) Choices don't matter at all. There's two endings possible from 1 choice at the end. All those choices you have made along the way, which many people claim to be better than Telltale's choices, end up in nothing.\n\nEdit: Actually Viscerella did a good job of summarizing why this game fails to make an impact.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/recommended/319630/","lothy","Lothy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/","1457 products in account","I was rather torn when I finished playing Episode one.\nOn the one hand, I loved the game: It played pretty smoothly on my computer once I lowered the resolution, which is more than I can say for the average game (there were some weird rainbow glow colors thing going on during my first play-through, but it was fixed by the developer and the second play-through I had no such problem), I liked the story (it seemed interesting, from what little you can glimpse on just one episode), I liked the style (gameplay wise it was somewhat reminiscent of, but not at all like, "The Walking Dead" - as far as choices and timing and actions, I mean), and I love being given options on what to reply. Plus, the time rewind was beautiful. I wish all games had that, because I always have my "No, wait, that's not at all what I wanted to say!" (particularly when they only offer you one part of the answer in text and it's not at all like you thought it was meant when they say it out loud and then you're stuck with the bad choice because the developers couldn't put things down clearly. Not here, though!).\nI also liked that I had all the time in the world (sort of) to consider each answer carefully, there were no real quick time events (which I kinda hate) and what did need to be addressed 'quickly' could be fixed with a rewind... so...\n\nOn the other hand, the first episode was way too short, even for the price tag, and as much as I want to play the next episodes, I'm not sure I'm ready to shell out the $17 for the season pack. And here's why:\n\nI understand things have to be scripted, but I would have liked to have the opportunity to explore more on my own. I understand it's a story game and not open world, thus is has to be linear, but it doesn't have to be that linear. What I mean is, why can't I go to the parking lot and tell the guy "I still don't have the USB drive" but look around the place anyway? I would have enjoyed the ability to go back and forth and explore thus a bit more (locked to the 'area', sure, as in, unable to leave school grounds, but still free to move within the areas within the school grounds).\nMoreover, I feel like not a single thing was resolved in Episode 1, and I think it would have been better if [is]something[/i] had been resolved. I don't even mean the big plot stuff, but... something small. I don't know, so that you felt like you actually accomplished something, which I think it's important in episodic games if you want them to get more.\nAs for the answers, while I do believe what you choose now will have consequences later, I was a bit disappointed upon replay that there really wasn't that much difference in the answers you got if you went one road versus another...\n\nAlso I read on the comments that a lot of people had troubles with the controls (on how to look/use stuff), but I had zero problem with it. It's the same some other adventure type games have used, there's nothing wrong or broken about them.\n\nI can't really comment on the story as a whole from just one episode, but it seemed interesting enough and I'd be curious to know more about her power. I hope it's revealed in further episodes how she got it or why she has it.\n\nReplayability is rather low, at least having just the one episode, because like I said, there weren't that many differences when choosing another road. I did love the time-rewind concept though, and I'd be looking forward to the season pass if it went on sale.\n\nAll that aside, I'd still recommend the game if you're into this kind of adventure/story types.","February 4, 2015","true","6.8"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","19","30","0","0"

And she sees her best friend from her childhood, Chloe, after a long time and they start to solve a mystery of a missing girl together n' w/ all of that comes an amazing plot w/ a lot of a stuff going Max's life & school with all the different scenarios & relationships.\n\nThe story overall was perfect, it had so many plotwists that it kept me interested all the way through, n' of course the humour was great as well.\n\nThey established a great atmosphere on this game as well, amazing job with that.\n\nThe characters in this game are as good as any game ever, they did all the different persons & personalities amazingly.\n\nI won't spoil it, but there are 2 different endings n' I must say that I was kind of disappointed with the one that I chose... Not cos' of the actual choice but cos' the game kind of didn't do justice to it. The other choice was so well put together & presented deeply but the ending I chose just didn't really show what happened...\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nThe game was also very very pretty. The graphics & camera angles were perfect. The game was really artistic & I really liked that, ever.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nThe game is point & click game, very similiar to Telltale's games. U make ur own choices & find different stuff as u wander around that matter the story.\n\nSOUNDTRACK:\n\nI had to make soundtrack as it's own category. This game has one of the BEST sondtracks of ANY game that I've ever played! The soundtrack is just absolutely amazing.\n\nVERDICT:\n\nI would suggest this game to almost everybody, if u are into story rich & choices matter games, this is ur choise.\nI just want to emphasise n' point out the excellence of all the characters & soundtrack of this game one more time, it was just mindblowingly good, this is truly a memorable game.\n\nSCORE:\n10 / 10","January 4","true","61.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stripstroke/recommended/319630/","stripstroke","Stripstroke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stripstroke/","596 products in account","This game has to be my favorite episodic game so far... it's beautiful. The developers know how to bring out your emotions, I was full of hope then torn apart, I felt like a superhero then the next second I felt useless, I loved and I lost, I gained knowledge then felt played. This game made me feel it all happiness, sadness, love, depression, hopeless, hope, struggle, fear etc the list goes on... it's art and everyone should experience it at least once in their lives!\n\nThe game has a lot of good things about it and right off the bat is the options it's better than I expected it to be it has fullscreen, borderless and windowed mode. It has decent options plenty to play with but they only go up to high there's no ultra or anything like that. Keyboard and mouse work great and everything is rebindable, a controller also works straight out of the box with no problem. The graphics in this game are very pretty sometimes ugly here and there but for the most part it's gorgeous to look at. The gameplay is pretty much your typical episodic game type stuff except with a twist here you can rewind time giving you so much more possibilities to work with it's great fun! Plus the game has small time puzzles if your a fan of that. THE SOUNDTRACK IS BEAUTIFUL some of the best I've heard in a game to date, you can easily listen to it outside of the game... it's honestly worth a listen too. The story at first is your typical cliche teen flick but then rapidly changes... so don't be fooled by it's looks at first the game opens up a lot later on. The game is a good length I was expecting 12-15 hours and including 100% it's like 17 hours. The game does one thing right with collectibles they don't force you to go looking for them they want you to explore, talk and hell if you don't like that on the first run? You can simply always restart episodes in collectible mode which is super super super good plus one for that!\n\nWhile I would love to say the game is perfect it's not I mean for one the puzzles there either too easy or too annoying it's not that fun to go through. Sometimes the story just drags on... I guess you get say they left in space to take breathers but honestly I didn't enjoy those parts. The game like I said before does have ugly looking textures, while I usually never complain about dumb crap like that... in this game though it is pretty noticeable like the hands GOD THE HANDS! While I'm sure some people like it there are things to the game that are so easily missable until you see them in the results screen making you scratch your head as in how the hell could you have possibly missed something like that. One minor problem I had was the game is screenshot madness which I love until an item you pick up gets stuck on your screen... bad design choice on that one should have made it a toggle off and on feature.\n\nI think the game is wonderful and I would honestly recommend it to anyone like I said before it's something everyone should experience at least once in their lives... I cannot wait to see what's in store for us in season 2!","February 4, 2015","true","17.4"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","13","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whadayalookinat/recommended/319630/","whadayalookinat","BrokenLink","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whadayalookinat/","108 products in account","Note: this review contains MAJOR SPOILERS for all 5 episodes of Life is Strange.\nI always liked story-driven games, and I never minded the limited interactivity they usually offer, so naturally, after I read about "Life is Strange", and the stellar reviews it got from critics and users alike, I thought I'd give it a try.\n\nI must have missed something along the road, because I'm nowhere near to agreeing with all the praise Life is Strange has received.\n\nLife is Strange has an intriguing enough set-up: you're Max Caulfield, a photography student in Arcadia Bay, where strange environmental phenomena occur, along with some students' disappearances over at Blackwell Academy that Max and her best friend, Chloe Price, are trying to solve, helped by Max's ability to reverse time.\n\nI guess I put too much faith on the writers, hoping they could successfully juggle all these seemingly unrelated plot points and tell a concrete story.\n\nThey didn't.\n\nThe main problem here is the attempt to tell multiple stories at once: Max's coming-of-age, the relationship between Max and Chloe, the environmental occurrences and the mysteries going on at Blackwell Academy.\n\nThe strange happenings include snow on a sunny day, birds falling dead on the streets, a sun eclipse, whales being washed up on the beach, the appearance of a second moon and, finally, a gigantic tornado. These are mostly on the background, teasing the fact that something big is coming. It's a fascinating plot point, to say the least, and I couldn't wait to see where they were going with it.\n\nTurns out, nowhere. None of it mattered, or is explained in any way. And I don't mind ambiguous storytelling; but this isn't ambiguous, nor fair. It's cheating out on your continuous teasing.\n\nAs far as the mystery of the disappearances goes, it's awkwardly brought to an end via a ridiculous plot-twist, that contains a 180 degree turn from a particular character that goes from cool and collected to sadistic and unfeeling, a change of temperament so forced and out of the blue I had a hard time buying it.\n\nNow, let's talk about the ending.\n\nFirst things first, whatever choices you've made throughout all 5 episodes, big or small, have absolutely no impact on the final choice you're presented with: either to sacrifice Chloe in order to save Arcadia Bay from a tornado (if it sounds illogical, it's because it is), or let the tornado destroy the whole town.\n\nTruth be told, I'm fine with this binary ending. It goes without saying that multiple endings would be preferable, but this is what we got.\n\nAnd "this" is REALLY problematic, story-and-gameplay-wise.\n\nIt's obvious that the "Save Chloe" ending was a quick footnote, a sudden realization from the writers that, hey, we can't have only one ending, quick, let's hastily write an underwhelming conclusion that we hope none of the players choose, because let's face it, it's not the true ending to the story we want to tell.\n\nThat's not to say that the "Save Arcadia Bay" ending is a fitting conclusion.\n\nIt's not, for a very simple reason: it's unfair. Both to the player and to Chloe.\n\nI understand that the main theme of Life is Strange is the "Butterfly Effect": the minutest of actions can bring about the apocalypse. And I can see why letting Chloe die is supposed to emphasize this. But going all the way back in time, to the first moments you spend in Blackwell Academy, apart from rudely erasing EVERYTHING you've done in the past 13 hours or so, undoes another of the game's main themes: the relationship between Max and Chloe.\n\nWith Chloe dead, she's never reunited with Max. She's never redeemed from her problematic lifestyle. They never fix each other's brokenness. Chloe just ends up dead, shot in the stomach, in a toilet in Blackwell Academy. If that's not unfair to a strong character such as Chloe, I don't know what is. All this character development, undone - just for the sake of a bittersweet ending, the emotional power of which is nonexistent once you realize the way Chloe's character was handled.\n\nWhat's frustrating is that Life is Strange does wonders in some aspects, which only shows the wasted potential - and the game it could have been.\n\nThe oil-painting-like art style is beautiful and fits the environment and characters just right. The sound design and mixing is top-notch, and the soundtrack (both the original and the licensed) is superb.\n\nBut where Life is Strange truly shines is when it focuses on Max and Chloe. The chemistry they have is incredible, and the interplay between them is, for the most part, natural, honest and, above all, convincing. Chloe, especially, is a surprisingly well-written character, and Ashly Burch's performance is pretty much flawless. This strong chemistry makes the first hour of Episode 4, "Dark Room", one of the most quietly powerful sequences I've experienced in a video game.\n\nIt's a shame, having these brief glimpses of strong storytelling, only for them to be overshadowed by the game's inability to organically combine many plot points. By the end of Episode 4, too many loose ends were hanging in the air for them to be resolved in a satisfactory way in the final Episode; it was pretty much inevitable for the story to be hastily ended.\n\nThe game crumbled under its own ambition.\n\ntl;dr version: A mess of a story that's too ambitious for its own good, with some scattered moments of brilliance that are overshadowed by a lack of clear vision; and an ending that reduces you to two unfair outcomes whilst completely obliterating every single decision you've made throughout the journey.","May 15","false","18.9"," 59 of 106 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","59","106","2","9"

Though the ending did screw everything up by basically erasing everything you done previously and making your feelings towards characters inconsequential. But that's the frigging time travel for you - just can't get everything you want the way you want.\n\nI would advise you to not repeat my mistake and do not look at forums, because the second i did i learned who the main villain was and pretty much stopped caring.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoegays/recommended/319630/","shoegays","shoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoegays/","513 products in account","A story-driven point-and-click adventure in the vein of Telltale's current direction, but with an added twist: You can rewind time.\n\nWhat starts as just a quirky, vaguely ominous Lynchian spin on your everyday teen's social minefields and petty high-school fiefdoms quickly becomes more tense, with frequent life-or-death consequences and plenty of tugs at the heartstrings. Things in Life is Strange are, on the surface, far less dire than in comprable games like Telltale's The Walking Dead, but it doesn't shy from world-shattering climax or a smaller, more personal apocalypse.\n\nThe time travel gimmick seems one-dimensional at first, just allowing you to correct mistakes. But there are some advanced applications. Since you stay anchored to your position while you rewind time, you can effectively "teleport" with it or pick up objects so they remain unaffected by the rewind. It also allows you to see multiple outcomes when presented with branching choices. There's still no telling how one choice will differ from another if and when they carry over to later episodes, but at least you won't be blinsided by the immediate consequences of anything, since you can use your rewind powers to check all your options, find out what information could be vital to a conversation, and return fully prepared.\n\nOne thing that became really endearing is just the sheer amount of stuff to do. Life is Strange opens up lots of stuff to look at, people to talk to, and so on, even if a lot of it has no plot consequence. The result is a world that feels less "gamey." You're not being railroaded through puzzles and setpieces. And since the puzzling in Life is Strange is pretty un-demanding, that's a plus.\n","October 31, 2015","true","22.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yurix3m/recommended/319630/","yurix3m","[Pdox]#FeelTheBern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yurix3m/","263 products in account","Well, I just finished episode one, so this review will at start ONLY give my views on the first episode.\nWhat is "Life is Strange"? Well, I would say Life is Strange is an story driven adventure game alá Telltale Game.\nIs that it? No, that's the thing, it isn't. If it was I might have called these guys "copycats" but that wouldn't really have been fair, since I do not call Call of Duty copycats of Battlefield or the other way around.\n\nBut to return to the subject, it isn't a Telltale Games clone in that way that it actually has game play.\nTelltale Games are famous for letting the player draw his or her own story by choosing different paths, and sometimes some easier puzzles (At least in The Walking Dead S1) This game has that, and a little more. This first episode has more puzzles than a whole season of Telltale Games, sure they aren't hard to do, but... The way you are doing them, that's the interesting way.\n\nAs you probably know, this game is about a girl, her name is Max and she's 18 years old, she just started going to this high-school which name I've unfortunately already forgot. It was something typical American. However, she discovers very early in the game that she can timetravel, at least a few seconds. This time-traveling is the main focus of the puzzles in Episode 1. You want to do something, you try to do something, you fail, you rewind time, see what's going on, change what you did earlier, and ta-da success!\n\nUnfortunately this time-travel option is not available, but only when the game want it to be, which at times are a bit frustrating. I was at the time of playing talking about the game with a friend who became very interested when a certain scene happened in the game, so I said I could show him with the Steam-stream, however I wasn't able to turn back the clock at that time. Nothing big but I just wanted to state that.\n\nHow is the atmosphere of the game? Does it fit an 18 year old girls mind? Well, in a stereotypical way, yes. Do I like it? Yes. It fits perfectly to Max and her surrounding. The music is great, the art style of the game is beautiful. Not perfect though. There are quite a few graphical glitches and the faces seem... a bit... lifeless at time. But Life is Strange eh? ;)\n\nOne thing that did surprise me quite a lot was the length of the episode. Used to playing Telltale Games I thought this would be like... 1.5 - 2.5 hours at most. I spent a bit over 4 hours playing this game! I wanted to explore everything! Get to know everyone. Unfortunately I didn't even get that chance! The episode is taking your through different areas of the campus and some other places, but there are loading times between these areas, and if you enter "Area 2" from "Area 1" and you have something to do in "Area 2" you can't return to "Area 1", it simply tells you "I can't leave yet" or a similar message.\n\nThis was quite sad because I didn't explore "Area 1" fully, I missed a lot of photography possibilities, yes you can actually take pictures of things. (Only things the game wants you to take pictures of though, and there are achievements) So not only did I miss these things, but I also missed achievements. (Not that important though, I just wanted you to know)\n\nNow I talked about quite a lot of things, but haven't really mentioned the story, except the whole time-travelling thing, which by itself is big thing but the story is more than this. A girl has gone missing, which is made known by all the "Missing person" papers everywhere, and this made me think the whole story has something to do with her, she is mentioned more and more often while the time is passing, so I guess there is something mysterious going on around her.\n\nEither way I can't wait for the next episode! Which apparently will come in March 2015. I highly recommend this to any adventure game player.","January 30, 2015","true","50.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Its been 4-5 hours since i completed the game and i cant stop thinking about life is strange and chloe . Even the ost is is oozing through my speakers while writing this review . I just cant take it out of my head  . The plot is really good and will keep things interesting till the end . The game is a feel good game and depressing at the same time . I was having a hard time deciding between the choices . There were many moments where i was like " oh man why do i have to choose between the two " Although you can rewind and undo your action after watching the outcome . That was pretty cool . The game made me feel nostalgic about my own childhood days .Story is good and keeps getting better & more complex with every season and drops down little bit in final season .  The choices you make also matter to a good extent and results in changed character behaviour , outcomes , different scenario and more dialogues .\n\nLast time i cared so much for the characters or was emotionally attached to them was in DS1( sif & artorias ) & Max Payne 3 . The chemistry between max and chloe is fantastic and the game does a great job at showing the bond between the two characters and human emotions . Chloe is one of fav. character now . Few Other characters are likeable too and are interesting . I was shocked at chapter 3 ending and had a genuine smile on my face after returning back( chapter 4 ). When you'll play it you'll get it .That was the impact the game left on me .\n\nSoundtrack is mind blowing and so relaxing . It definitely is my one of fav. and ingame it kicks in at the right time . The gameplay is your regular button pressing & draggin stuff you have in story based games and is well done . Presentation is nice and arcadia bay reminds me of twin peaks .Voice actors did a great work too . There are many refrences to twin peaks which fans can easily spot .\n\nGame has some flaws which are related to lip syncing , plot holes and some unexplained things . But nothing is perfect ( except DS nad RE4 :p ) so the quality of the game overshadows there issues . Game has few moments of flawed plot & writing  . Which most probably you'll give a thought after finishing the game . As for the unexplained things i dont think that is a problem for many as it retains the mysterious aura of the game and let the community come up with fan theories and connect the dots .\n\nOverall , Life is strange is a beautiful game with great characters . Those who like story based games or like characters ingame should give this a try . Game tells good things about life, friendship and why sometimes it is good to be selfish . How lifes' circumstances can change ones destiny is shown beautifuly esp. in chapter 3 & 4 . It is one of the few games that made me sad and the only game that made my eyes wet. Will praise the ost again coz oh man that ost is god tier, it is so so good .I am hooked onto it . I dont think i'll ever forget this game esp. chapter 3 ending ,  chapter 4 , chloe & the final decision.

Ok... typical school drama, but something got my attention. Maybe it was that butterfly scene and the fact Max wasn't just living an interpersonal dilemma; it was intrapersonal (her with herself) and i love that.\nEpisode 2 for sure got me inside that game and made my day, actually. I was so happy by my decisions and the so well-constructed characters and graphics. "This storyline is gr.. WHAT THE HELL IS SHE DOING? NOOOOO" (no spoilers allowed ;-;).\nEpisode 3 brought me new thoughts: "what the hell is going on? What if I choose this... hm...". Minute after minute i was recognizing me into Life is Strange. I couldn't skip one page of Max's Book neither to try everything or talk to everybody, etc. All the transitions, flashbacks and mechanics of the game "felt like a glove".\nEpisode 4: thinking about what words to use, i chose this: WHATATAT I NEED EPISODE 5 THIS CANT BE LIKE THIS PLS IS SOMEONE THERE?\n\nConclusion: maybe I'm not the best guy to conclude anything because i'm addicted to this game, but here are some facts:\n- Impressive storyline\n- Really good graphics\n- Interesting mechanic. Easy to learn and make you think a lot!\n- Wonderful relations (inter and intrapersonal --> Max with others, Max with herself, you with yourself :o)\n- Soundtrack... argh, this soundtrack is beautiful *-*\n- Just to make sure you read that: AMAZING STORYLINE\n- The lipsync is not really good =(\n- I read in another review saying that you can't shake a Polaroid otherwise your photo will be destroyed...

By that I mean, I know there had been people crying because of the happenings of this game, I can tell I managed not to cry but there were numerous moments (almost the whole game) which caught me up really strong.\n\nIf thats not enough, you build up a relationship with every single character in this game (which is normal in most games to be honest).\nOn top of that every choice you make in this game is a 'Butterfly Effect', means every single choice you make ingame might change past, presence or future.\nI just finished the game so my mind is still heavily blown and emotions are overflowing (to be honest I think I'll get emotional issues for the end of the week XD)\nThe price is too fair. I would pay three times more to enjoy all that emotion and experience.\nIn other words I must say this is a masterpiece, there is much more to the game as for example everyone has their spirit animal, the colors are bound to characters because they have specific meanings and alot of other things I could count up  if my mind wouldn't be too blasted from what I just experienced playing.\n\nIn short: Buy this game, let emotions slap you right in the face, build up a relationship to each character, get mind-blown all the time, go cry in a corner because the game wrecked your emotions.\nAlso, I have not encountered any bugs whatsoever, so technically this game also is a masterpiece.\nI'd also like to spoil something I encountered at the end. On the title screen after finishing episode 5, there was a message saying 'Thank you for playing Life is Strange Season 1', which means there might be another season coming up next year, so more emotions, more people who got converted into emotional wracks, more relations, more slaps in the face, and much more gaming experience.\n\nTEXT ABOVE IN SHORT- This game is one of the best games I have ever played\n- Gets really emotional (really really really emotional)\n- Drags you into the gameplay\n- You might cry like a little b*tch but thats nothing to worry about when playing this game\n- I can clearly say buy this game - you will not regret it.","October 19, 2015","true","23.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

If you are that type, I have a good news for you. When you play it later on, whenever that is, you will like it enough if not totally enjoy it. The wait will be worth it.\n\nSure, I am only talking about the game by the first episode alone, and this review can be reviewed. To compare with other episodic adventure games, Life Is Strange provides a richer content in storyline in form of verbal choices and journal reading. A lot more character is involved and there is a lot more content for you to read and explore so to fully enjoy the game you shouldn't really rush through it. This also in turns give more game time for the you to play the game when new episode releases.\n\nAside from the ability that your main character has, the game is realistic which evolve around college students and all the dramas involved in college life. Aside from having pretty graphics and arts, the game requires you to make choices of which you can be given the chance to correct (with limit of course) and just make  your own story of how you want your character to be, to represent, and to progress with the story flow. To top it off, the game is also accompanied by a good theme and soundtrack.\n\n\n\n","February 10, 2015","true","18.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","1"

Or do something that you think should have been done?\n\nWell, this point and click adventure explores that idea, quite extensively. The idea sounds cliché at first, like this is some high school drama where you can use superpowers to beat everyone who is mean to you. But it's more than that, it goes much further down the rabbit hole.\n\nNot only is the game great story-wise, but it also has more interactivity than just dialogue choices. You can rewind time and perform actions that you could not do before, due to acquiring knowledge about what is going to happen. Doing this kind of thing in i.e. a movie would be pretty confusing, right? But in the game, it being a game mechanic, it kind of made sense, in its own way.\n\nSo, in my opinion, this game is amazing. But opinions are subjective, so I can't say if you would feel the same. If you have played Telltale games previously, I suggest you try this out. I do hope Dontnod does more of these kind of adventures.","November 2, 2015","true","9.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mmxave/recommended/319630/","mmxave","Ave","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mmxave/","263 products in account","UPDATE: Episode 3 Review down below!\n\nLife Is Strange™ is basically a third person point and click adventure like The Walking Dead from Telltale Games.\n\nStory\nYou follow the story of young Max who is a student at the Blackwell Academy - a school focused on photography and arts. The story starts out of the blue (though I'm not exactly gonna write how) and puts you into the life of an eighteen year old girl. This obviously means teen problems, anxiety and the fear of not belonging to society. Shortly after the introduction you discover that Max has a supernatural gift: Time Rewinding. She can jump back in time and redo things (for example if she broke a glass or something she could try and prevent this from happening) With this comes the important aspect of the Butterfly Effect. (The tiniest difference could make a huge impact) What does that mean now? One little aspect of Episode 1 could make the outcome of Episode 5 totally different (in theory - we will see how the developers will implement this). In comparison to The Walking Dead I have the feeling that my decisions really matter and don't just "swap out" some characters or items, etc. It feels like everything is connected in some way. The cool thing about this is that you can try out all possibilities just by rewinding time. Not feeling okay with your decision? Rewind time and try again!\n\nGameplay\nSo as mentioned you play Max from a Third Person View. I used my XBOX360-Gamepad and it felt pretty nice. Interacting works decent enough. You move Max with the left stick and can look around with the right stick. If there is something interesting to see the game will tell you which button you have to press to interact. (Mostly A or Y from what I have seen) You can run slightly faster by holding the Right Trigger and you can rewind time by holding the Left Trigger.  (They get explained anyway during the game, so don't worry)\n\nThe game focuses on you making decisions and just checking out stuff in the school and around. I must say that the diary and documents scattered throughout are really well written and I enjoyed reading them. I recommend you all to take the time and read them. The episode is short anyway and it gives you some interesting insight on the world of Life is Strange. There are some "puzzles" to be solved, where you have to use your rewinding skills in order to move on with the story. Nothing brainmelting so far, but still pretty cool. The gameplay is mostly interaction with the environment and talking to people.\n\nOne important thing to mention is that you are mostly bound to an area. So if you leave the area that means that you are progressing in the story and can't just go back immediately. It's perfectly fine if you just want to see the story and move from point A to B, but if you are a person like me that wants to check out everything possible you should take your time and be sure that you saw everything.\n\nGraphics\nSo here is one thing that bothers me personally. I actually like the "drawn" style of Life is Strange but all the plants (bushes, trees, etc...) look horrible and awkward in my opinion. Indoors the graphics are perfectly fine for my taste.(though the hair of some people may look awkward at first) I do like however how the developers played with light and shadows. The sunset looks authentic and beautiful. So you can expect to take some screenshots!\n\nOther stuff\nThe voice acting is great and authentic. Max is well written (like basically all of the characters from what you can see in episode 1) and there are some nice hidden details like a family TV that used to be in the living room been given to the child since the family bought a new bigger TV. It actually makes you feel like they took the characters from a real world family and put them into an interesting story. One thing that I experienced was that the lip syncing is not so well. Not so bad, but I expect them to fix this in episode 2.\n\nOverall Life is Strange Episode 1 is a promising start to a great story and interesting characters. If you enjoyed The Walking Dead you will have a lot of fun with this game.\n\nEPISODE 2: Out Of Time Review\nSo finally episode 2 has been released and I couldn't wait to play it already. First of all for those of you who have trouble installing the second episode: If steam doesn't download the DLC automatically, check if you have any active downloads, pause those if needed. Untick the DLC and tick it again - restart steam and it should start to download the DLC. At least that worked for me.\n\nNow to the game: So we start of the next morning after the finale of episode 1. The cool thing about this game is that your actions from the previous episode really matter. Often throughout the episode I was like "Oh so if I had reacted the other way in the past I could have done this better/worse". This is something that TWD for example did not do very good. (at least in my opinion)\n\nThe locations are really great and you get to know the last two characters that have not been introduced yet. I was entertained greatly by the little tasks I had to do. And again there is a hell lot to explore and read - and I recommend you reading everything and by that I mean EVERYTHING. I realized that it can matter quite a lot if you get any side information, so take your time, explore every room and check twice before leaving. It is nice that there is no sort of rush going on. And there were a lot of cute little details hidden. I recommend looking for them!\n\nSo the story did not get a lot more input for now, I understand that they want to keep that for the last episodes, though I expect episode 3 to be much more storydriven compared to episode 2. This one is more about the characters (as I said introducing the two missing ones) and focuses on the relationship between Max and Chloe, but you also had to choose something, which could make future relationships change - if in the good way or bad way you have to see for yourself! The dialogues were between good and great. One thing I noticed is that the lipsyncing seems to be better. The game feels more polished now after all these patches - so good job there DONTNOD!\n\nSo to sum it up: Don't expect a lot of story for now. It is like 70% character development (which they really need to build up the story in the following episodes) and 30% "story" and tough decisions. And they really are tough, I was sitting for minutes thinking about the consequences. So if you haven't already bought the full game I recommend you doing so. So maybe one more question some people might ask: Is it better or worse than episode 1? Neither, they are both equally good. They each serve their own purpose (E1: Story/Character introduction - E2: Characterdevelopment) Episode 2 is again a fun experience and makes you want to see more from the life of little Max.\n\nEPISODE 3: Chaos Theory ReviewI was really hyped for the third episode Chaos Theory and I finally got to play it. What is there to say? My first impression was: Good. After finishing it: Magnificent. One thing that I kind of like is how this episode has two types of atmospheres. The first half feels different than usual. Calmer, more "private" - which is a nice change actually. The second half goes back to the usual feel we know from E1/E2. At least I had this feeling. As it was in the last episode we start with the next day. Reflecting about what happened the previous day and thinking about how it turned out. So the usual procedure: Wake up in your room, check everything, leave the room and start your adventure. Simple, yet nice. So what is there to say about the story and it's function? Well, again it is about character development, but this time we also get a big chunk of story that will probably blow your mind. And again there is a lot to discover and to read. The diary is always worth a look, so check it out whenever you can!","February 6, 2015","true","21.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","4"

It does seem like fluff, nothing but highschool/college drama with some gimmick rewind ability thrown in but it didn't take long to realize it was something completely different. The story is excellent, even while some of the dialogue is kinda cheesy and it becomes clear it is adults trying to write for teenagers (or maybe teenagers/young adults really do talk like that, idk) and the lip syncing was pretty horrible (though supposedly this was fix some in a patch.)\n\nMany scenes are so beautifully done, you do need to take the time to stop and look at everything (which is driven home since you can have Max stop, sit, and just look at her surroundings.) The episodes just ramp it up, episode 3 blew my mind, episode 4 kinda ♥♥♥♥ed me up, and episode 5... well I was prepared to be disappointed but it went completely sideways and I did not expect a lot of what happened. The final end choice was somewhat disappointing, but otherwise I really, reaaaally enjoyed this game.","October 21, 2015","true","15.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

Or do something that you think should have been done?\n\nWell, this point and click adventure explores that idea, quite extensively. The idea sounds cliché at first, like this is some high school drama where you can use superpowers to beat everyone who is mean to you. But it's more than that, it goes much further down the rabbit hole.\n\nNot only is the game great story-wise, but it also has more interactivity than just dialogue choices. You can rewind time and perform actions that you could not do before, due to acquiring knowledge about what is going to happen. Doing this kind of thing in i.e. a movie would be pretty confusing, right? But in the game, it being a game mechanic, it kind of made sense, in its own way.\n\nSo, in my opinion, this game is amazing. But opinions are subjective, so I can't say if you would feel the same. If you have played Telltale games previously, I suggest you try this out. I do hope Dontnod does more of these kind of adventures.","November 2, 2015","true","9.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's good enough to keep you inside the game and click on every object just to hear Max's point of view about that thing. (at least that's what I did).\nCompared to The Walking Dead and other similar games from Telltale, the gameplay is pretty fluid and full of things to check out.

Also, it's sometimes a bit disappointing no matter how many do-overs you get.\n\nA review of the game really needs to start at the ending.  After four episodes (a few hours each) of making choices, seeing consequences and constantly double-guessing yourself the game culminates in a final episode that goes completely off the rails.  Setting aside player opinions on the climax and whether or not your choices were meaningful, the ending is bogged down in lengthy cut scenes interspersed with irritating mechanics such as a maze sequence or scenes that try to turn the casual interface into a twitch game.  Your "rewind" power gives you infinite attempts to get it right but timing a kick or a trip just didn't feel right.  The pacing was off as well -- one moment you're leaning back in your chair doing nothing for five minutes as people on the screen talk, the next it's hustle, hustle.  Simply put, I didn't have much fun for the final hours of the game.\n\nUp until that point though, Life is Strange is an interesting enough journey and occasional puzzler revolving around a teenage girl, Max, who learns in a moment of crisis that she has the ability to rewind time, using the power to attempt to solve the mysterious happenings at her school and re-connect with her estranged best friend.  With the plot focusing on the teens, the dialogue is sometimes eye-rolling and Max is a bit too precious and twee for anyone's good but the story has moments of genuine pathos and the mysterious story line has its own twists.  I may be a bit too removed from my teenage days to get "hit in the feels" (as I understand the kids are saying these days) but the story kept me playing despite this not really being my preferred genre of game.\n\nGame play is usually very simple and casual: You walk around, items of interest get highlighted with a circle, you look at or interact with them in some way.  Interlaced with this is your ability to rewind time, allowing you to prevent things from happening or alter the course of a conversation by presenting new information.  Many small instances of choice pop up as you play and each chapter ends with a break down of the decisions you made (or failed to make) and how many others did the same.  It's interesting to make a seemingly obvious decision and then see that only 35% of the players thought the same way.  The art is usually attractive and visually consistent although some parts looked distracting low-res.  The mainly acoustic indie soundtrack wasn't my cup of tea but fit the overall feel of the game.\n\nUltimately, I give the game a somewhat reluctant recommendation despite its unwieldy conclusion. The road to that ending was interesting enough and had enough bright moments to make it worth taking even if ending falls flat.","March 9","true","20.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Okay, not really, I liked the girls too (hey I am a man, okay?), and being able to play the game from a girl's perspective, once for the obvious curiosity towards girls (okay I'll stop now, I promise!), but most importantly for seeing how cruel people can be to women, for that it tells a great story. Okay I said that already, and sure you'd say, "I've already seen a lot of movies like that already, so what's new?" But for once, this game takes things to the level where movies fail, besides, you still won't know everything you need to even when I add time travel or turning back time into the mix, which I love too by the way... I wish sometimes girls had that power or any other in real life too, especially after this game. Actually by playing as a girl and see the world from her angle, you would see how right I am. This game is a message, a good one. It's nothing sort of a usual "thriller movie," and in case you're wondering why the game starts with a big warning that you should stop playing the game something mental should happen to you (I was never really given time to read that text entirely), I don't believe in that stuff. The game is there for entertainment, and at the same time teaching you about real life, making this game a masterpiece with that so well working recipe. You just have to see the dark side of the world, in order to understand it. I believe these stuff happen anyway, and I think this game could help the next generation think twice before hurting girls. So that warning text should not stop you. Scary, or cruel, it's by far the best life simulator I've ever seen, although I'm not here to look down on Sims... Take it as an educational lesson of life. One that is well worth spending your time on. Finally, once a game that is not just about you doing nothing but increasing your chances of getting worse school grades. Yet it's nowhere near as boring as simulators like Arma. (Sorry, I had to make a comparison here.) Plus, solving puzzles is not only fun, it also makes you smarter. The game creators have set an outstanding example on how to create a great one.\n\nHaving said that, I have to say the graphics are great too, they add to the authenticity of the story, and man, have I ever got disappointed in a game using the Unreal Engine? Not ever. :) Play this game with a big enough monitor, a 5.1 sound system, and you are ready to take in a valuable experience. One that I am pretty sure you won't forget. :) So enjoy!\n\nEdit: I left out some details intentionally, because I didn't want to tell the ending.","December 13, 2015","true","23.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Many other reviews touch on how artful, deep, and cinematic this game can be, so i'll leave mine short and let you read those.\n\nBottom Line: Buy and Play this Game Immediately if you want a GREAT decision-based story game.","January 3","true","24.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Immersive, gut-wrenching, and thought-provoking. 10/10, especially considering its low cost. The production value is just incredible.\n\nMy advice:\n\n1. Don't rush it. Although the various choices offer some degree of replay-ability, nothing will ever be like the first time. Soak it up.\n\n2. Play this one late at night when the world is quiet, nothing is distracting you, and you're open to being thoughtful.\n\n3. Avoid spoilers. Don't read too much online until you've finished all five episodes.\n\n4. This is not a game you "win". Its value is in the experience it gives you, not in achieving any particular outcome. Some fans have complained that the choices you make along the way don't "matter at the end" as much as they wished they would. I disagree. They do matter - the relationships Max develops and dialogue along the way are significantly influenced by your choices. Like I said though, it's more like a novel than a traditional videogame. Nobody wins.\n\n\n\nMy only qualm with the game was technical - when I first started it wouldn't save my progress and I ended up having to replay most of the first episode. After much troubleshooting I figured out that the game has a problem when you install steam games on a disk other than C: (I have a ssd + two hdds). You have to manually create the following folder: C:\Users\Username\Documents\My Games\Life Is Strange. Then right click on the Life Is Strange folder, properties, and give full permissions. When you're playing and it shows the saving icon alt-tab to windows, open the folder, and make sure a save folder exists and it is writing a "LISSave" file in there.","November 4, 2015","true","19.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/demiorugas/recommended/319630/","demiorugas","Volshebnik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/demiorugas/","110 products in account","Life is . . . weird\nIndeed. And this little work shows it in a poetic manner: with blossoming fancy and one of the most vivid depictions of human experiences and emotions I have had the pleasure of enjoying, this is a dear gem, lovingly wrought.\n\nHere we may share the experiences of a few people in an intimate way that is quite rare in videogames: Few games are so focused on characters and emotion, while also relegating other typical details (like puzzle-solving, somewhat present in this title) to a little ornament; what is more, the remarkable elements of gameplay in the present case are so closely entwined with the themes and plots of the game, that everything is very seamless, smooth.\n\nAnd so, life can be, and usually is, quite perplexing; beautiful, and dreadful; it can be so wealthy in its complexities and its many adventures that it truly is awesome: This game expresses it very eloquently and lovely.\n\nWe feel the little joys, the little thrills, the doubts and the small or great woes that last, haunt for ever, or die with a friend's shared delight; we feel the horrible depths of a human being, and a human being's trembling within, and their wonderful love, their illusions, and disillusions; we also feel the soul-rending moments, the decisions that crush you, and the tender resurrections that come sometimes; and all these hopes, and all these cruelties seemingly small, of tiny moments, that scar us, scare us, and the brief joys that grow long and feel eternized; we feel our own longings and raptures and sorrows, our own threats and our own kindness; and we feel glad or sorry for these imaginary people in the little town of Arcadia Bay, whom we could easily meet (or have already met) and maybe know, and like, and love, there, beyond our doors.\n\nThe characters in the game are believable, very detailed; they do feel alive, with memories and longings, fears and joys; their selves complex and not vanishing; they are, in short, very human. Flawed, loveable or frightening, with their happiness and their horror; loveable because flawed, perhaps; or we feel pity for them, or we know, somehow, that if someone is hurtful, they are not a mere symbol or type, no, but something has sickened their mind, long ago, even. The relationships between these creatures are represented in all their tenderness and lament.\n\nI found Max Caulfield, whom we may call the protagonist, to be a lovely young woman: tender and dreamy, witty, with shy wings...It was very pleasant to spend the entire adventure in her company, for from each passing remark of hers, and her gestures, her artistic sensibility, and her thoughts - to all the grand emotions that touch her, and with which she must needs touch us, Max feels like a real, living person.\n\nVisually, the game is very pretty; a bit like a painting, in spirit, at least; its visual style is in harmony with the rest of the composition. Its sounds, too, are excellent, from the ambient sounds to the voices. The script is very good: spontaneous, now light-hearted and now heart-wrenching, often whimsical and pretty much always pleasant.\n\nThe story if wonderful; so humane, above all, whatever weird things happen, and they do happen. Its twists and turns are now soft, now painful, astounding...Of course, its episodic format is remarkable: each episode takes you on such an emotional symphony that when its ending comes, with its blow rather tender or very hard, you may even cry. Now, I played this when the full game had been released (I played one episode per day) but I can imagine the mental workings of those who had to wait a couple of months for the next episode.\n\nPlaying with time, with the power of altering one's past decisions, with all the winding consequences thereof (the manifest effects, and the sublter, unsuspected ones, with the inherent paradoxes and other bewildering philosophical matters), is only one aspect among the profound topics (both lofty and quotidian, till they become intertwined) touched by the game. So much to feel and so much to think of.\n\nThe music: a perfect counterpart to the rest. Notwithstanding one's taste for this music, I reckon it enhances the emotions, accentuates them; and half the tears or half the smiles may well be due to the soundtrack.\n\nThere are some flaws, of course (notwithstanding those of a, let's say, subjective character). The ones I found most significant where certain plot inconsistencies, which I cannot discuss without spoiling the story; suffice it to say that they are small-ish details which are incoherent and vex the tale somewhat; they are minor and forgettable, whereas the whole work is very memorable, and thus not a big deal; still, they could have been corrected very easily, I am sure, and (indeed) it is striking that they came to be there in the first place.\n\nLastly, this piece really is a glimpse, a profound and unforgettable glimpse, into human life; not all lives, sure: some will be very far away from a reality like the one here depicted; but many of us will find one, two, or countless affinities... (some other will, doubtless, find it all very close to their own life, save for their lack of time-manipulation abilities; or, what, that too?). Some of us will feel longings, nostalgia...or what? What will you feel, have felt?\n\nWhatever that is, I dare say that nobody will be left feeling nothing after they live this strange piece of life in the company of Max Caulfield.\n\nBut, of course, more than one person has once said: 'I am Nobody'. Now smile for the selfie...","January 12","true","23.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

And you all can tell, cause the best games are those, who touch us and make us cry, not just make us laugh and entertain, the true masterpieces get right under our skin, straight into our hearts!\n\nI don't even know where to start, maybe the graphics first. Optically, the game is already a beauty with its mix of realistic and comic-art graphics, the colors, the lighting and just everything, it looks so beautiful, although this is not the most important aspect of the game.\nBecause the most important thing about a great game is the story! And this game has maybe the greatest storytelling I have ever witnessed. You'll get thrilled from the very first minute and the journey gets more and more emotional and touching the further you get. And I can ensure you, that you will spill some tears over this story, tears of joy as well as tears of sadness, this game is just so intense, you almost can't find the words to describe it. There are so many different and difficult decisions to make, that you really have to think about them, since they more or less influence the outcome of the whole story. And some of them are really tough to make. Some decisions make you laugh, some make you angry and some even make you cry! And the story also has some big twist in store. Were partly shocking to me.\nLife is Strange features also a nice Indie-soundtrack, that really fits into, cause it accompanies you and even contributes to thrill and touch you throughout the whole storyline.\nAnd at a price of just 20 bucks for all 5 episodes (when not on sale) this is a true bargain, considering how much you get.\n\nI honestly didn't expect the game to be so emotional and thrilling, even though I heard it is really good, but "really good"  is the biggest understatement, that you could ever make about this masterpiece! After over 21 hours of playtime I finished this emotional journey and I'm also a bit sad, I wished, this game would last forever. But I think I will start replaying it tonight, since there are so many decisions I haven't picked yet, where I can see how the story changes and I'm really looking forward to it. There are not many games, who you want to replay right after you finished them! But this is one of the few and probably the best game ever made (already mentioned). And I really hope there will be a 2nd part of Life is Strange, cause I can't wait to dive into this world again.

The story is deep and engrossing with unexpected twists and turns in every episode which include choices that drastically impact the overall experience of the game.\n\nThe major difference between Life Is Strange and others in the genre is that the protagonist, Max, is able to rewind time at will to "redo" a conversation or action.  This is not a simple rewind, however, as Max, herself, remembers what happened and can react or alter her actions accordingly.  For example, if Max is speaking to a fellow student, that student may say something to her that she can rewind and work into the conversation without the other party being aware that they were the ones who'd fed her said information in the first place, albeit in another timeline.  It's an interesting mechanic and it works well as the writing is done so well in the game that even with infinite redo option for a chapter you're still never sure if you made the 'right' choice.  This feeling of unease and anxiety over your choices only intensifies as the story seems to get progressively darker as more of the underlying nature of Arcadia Bay is revealed.\n\nI highly recommend this game to fans of dramatic storytelling, and especially to those who enjoy the Telltale template of personalized said storytelling through player choices that alter the experience.  The plot clearly had a lot of thought put into it, the characters are memorable and well written, and the game itself (aside from a few 'puzzle' parts that were time consuming and a bit dull) is an enjoyable experience.","October 20, 2015","true","20.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I thought to myself: "Okay, it's only 20 bucks for 5 episodes, could be fun, I mean I liked games like The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, might as well give this game a try."\n\nSo I bought this game and I'm so overwhelmed by greatness, I do love nearly everything about this game, the plot, the characters, the atmosphere, hell gosh the soundtrack!\nEven though the Lyp-Sync is way off and there are some visual bugs like floating items (Can be fixed with future patches and is not game breaking), it deserves better reviews and ratings and it is my best pick of 2015 so far. In fact the only reason why sites like IGN gave this game only a "6.5/10" is because this game has a very specific target audience, as for me, I'm totally one of the audience as someone who turned 18 this year and almost finished school.\nI am so hyped for episode 3 which will be released in may and I am talking non-stop about the previous 2 episodes so far, I spend so many hours on talking with my friends about this awesome game.\nWe (My friends and I) tried to analyse the game and understand what makes this a great game but it is nearly impossible to say specific things.\nThe most impressive thing so far is the freedom. Of course you have choices in "The Walking Dead" too, but these are represented through a short "Pick this or this option" for which the result also doesn't differ much. In Life is Strange every little choice is affecting something (so far at least) and while the game progresses you can interact with so many little things. Unlike in Telltale Games, you can explore the world and feel free, heck I spent hours and hours replaying scenes to watch every single detail. (The game has a collectible mode where you can easily replay scenes without affecting your actual plot progression!)\nDontnod Entertainment really did a great job and for that price it's completely worth it. It deserves better ratings.\n\nTL:DR Worth it! Buy it! Play it!

Might contain a few spoilers there and then but not as much. I hope this helps you with your doubt of buying the game or not\nBackground about the game: It's a story about a girl that is given rewind powers right after she goes back to school where she used to live and she's reunited with her best friend. The story evolves after they meet again with a lot of plot twists and surprises.  Choices matter for certain events but it doesn't affect your ending that much, you will still have to make the same decision at the end, not depending on the choices you made\n\nWhat I like about this game I really enjoy playing games that are episodic and story rich, those are my type of games. This was one f the greatest games I've ever played. You get to interact with stuff in the game itself, make choices and you also have a story part to it. I would only recommend it if you like Story-rich, Choice based games if those are not your type of games, you might not like it as much.\n\nShort list of Pros and Cons\nPros:\n- Well-written story\n- Choice based\n- Great Graphics\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=474608759\n- Difficult ending\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=546028350\n- Plot twists and surprises\n- Background music\n- Chance to make a different choice\n\nCons:\n- A few minor bugs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=490333401\n- Choices don't matter in the end.\n-----------\nSummary: As I've already said, it's a really great game but categorized to certain people as not everyone's game interests are the same. It's at a fair price and when it's on sale it's even better and a must grab. Rating 9.8/10","November 2, 2015","true","18.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Puoh/recommended/319630/","Puoh","Puoh'","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Puoh/","122 products in account","The game has, so far, been giving of a really cozy feel with the very likeable and realistic characters. It's nice to to be able to really interact with so many of the characters in-game.\n\nYou play as Max Caulfield, your regular teenager, until she finds out that she can rewind time. She recently moved back to her hometown 'Arcadia Bay' to study at Blackwell Academy. Right after she discovers her power to rewind time she is also reunited with her childhood friend Chloe Price. Max keeps having these visions of a huge storm coming to and destroying Arcadia Bay.\n\n\nVisuals, environment:\n\nI really love the environment of Life is strange. The school campus, the lighthouse, Chloe's house.\nIt really just looks... casual, in a really good way. What makes this a super cozy game to me is the way the creators use the sun to just make every scene so beautiful with the visible sun rays (Not sure if this is what it's called...).\nThe graphics doesnt have to be requiring a GTX 980 to be good. Life is strange proves that. The game is ridiculously good looking without having those "super sick" graphics.  I don't really know how to describe how much I love the visuals.\n\nVisual and environment rating: 10/10 The beautiful scenes are what makes it for me.\n\n\nVoice acting:\n\nThe game has a lot of good voice actors, but sometimes the dialogue between the characters can sound pretty awkward.\nAt some times I just don't buy it. At least the voice acting in episode 2 gets a lot better. Overall, I still think it's good.\nThe mouths not syncing with the voices adds to my rating here.\n\nVoice acting rating: 7,5/10\n\n\nSoundtrack and BGM:\n\nThe soundtrack in Life is strange is perfect as it is very "calming" and adds to the cozy feel of playing as a regular teenager. The music itself always seem to fit in with the environment you find yourself in.  I've been listening to the soundtrack non-stop since I played through the first episode.\n\nSoundtrack rating: 9.5/10, as I really love it.\n\n\nStory:\n\nIt has really just been a lot of introduction to the story so far and we haven't really gotten that much into it. But there is a storm coming and a lot to unravel.\n\nStory rating (thus far): 8/10, I'll get back to this rating when I've finished the game.\n\n\nIn Life is Strange, your choices matter. It's a really cozy game and I like how easy it is to bond with the characters. I actually started caring a lot about them.\n\nOverall score: 9/10, again, I'll come back to give it a final rating when I'm done with all the episodes. But even so far, I highly recommend this game.","April 12, 2015","true","65.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","4"

Life Is Strange™ has such an amazing story that even gives Telltale Games a run for their money.This game is better then anything Telltale Games has ever done. After playing the first episode I was dying for more as the story had me hooked quicker than any of Telltale's games had ever done and realised i still had two episodes to go through. Now for a list Of Pros and Cons for Life Is Strange™\n\nPros+\n+VERYemotional and sad storyline (That leaves you wanting a whole lot more)\n+Interesting characters that you feel for, and ones that make you just want to kick their ♥♥♥\n+Beautiful hand-painted visuals\n+Cool interaction feature\n+Actions that actually have consequences when they are performed (Unlike Telltale)\n+Nice, Calming soundtrack\n+Interesting rewind mechanic that builds the story and world around you\n\nCons-\n-Terrible, Terrible Lip Sync\n\nIn conclusion, Life Is Strange™ is a game every steam user should own, no questions asked, even if you don't like these kinds of games, the story could, would and should have you hooked right from the get-go. Life Is Strange™, quite possibly, is my GOTY already.\n\nI give it 9/10","July 4, 2015","true","14.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BajES/recommended/319630/","BajES","BajES","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BajES/","142 products in account","Life Is Strange is one of the best story-focused games I have ever played, beating Telltale in their own game of point-and-click adventures. Do note that spoiler tags include actual spoilers for the game.\n\nGameplayLife Is Strange is a game entirely based on the story it presents. You need to understand said story in order to get the best possible results in the game, so there is actually some skill involved. You are required to solve a mystery in the game, and keeping the whole puzzle with all its clues and questions in your head is necessary if you want to succeed.\n\nIt's main gimmick, the Rewind ability, allows the player to travel backwards in time by a limited amount, allowing you to replay conversations, in-game situations, and so on. This ability is particularly useful when you make a choice, and you want to see what the reaction of a character is to any given line of dialogue. You can't exploit this ability too much, as you are limited to only rewinding that specific "scene" or level, but not any more so, and the choices you make in episode one echo all the way to the end, meaning that you need to have an eye for knowing what decisions are the right ones to make. You can, however, see what your character would say if you made a dialogue choice, allowing you to back out if you realize that isn't what you would've said, and allowing you to see the immediate consequences to those actions. You can occasionally even get opportunities to go full groundhog day. The game even mentions the movie at one point.\n\nThe Rewind ability is also useful in in-game situations. When you have to move stealthily without being seen, you can run past any "guards" and reach the area you were supposed to reach, and rewind. Rewinding doesn't move you at all, you remain where you rewinded. Even items obtained in the future remain with you as you rewind back, even if you rewind to before you obtained the items. This is not a fault, it's a gameplay mechanic that you need to use during some situations. For example, stealing an item can just be done by taking it from them while they see you do it, but then rewinding fast enough to before they even took said item from their pocket, so that they never even know you took it.\n\nThe game does challenge you with sections of the game where your rewind ability is disabled and the choices you make are life-or-death decisions.\n\nGraphics, sound, artstyle, performanceThe game runs fairly well on an average PC, and has above average graphics, even if there are a few faults like the Vortex Club crowd consisting partially of sprites but mostly it's very neat. The artstyle and the sounds fit the game, the music and the visuals really give the good kind of indie feel, the kind of comfy and nostalgic atmosphere that fits perfectly. I personally don't like indie games too much, but this one doesn't feel like an indie game at all. This could've easily been released by Naughty Dog or Telltale, and I wouldnt've been suprised at all.\n\nThe narrative, the characters and the storyAs you're reading this on Steam, you probably know the story, but I'll tell you my "version":\nThe game focuses on Maxine "Max" Caulfield, an 18-year old girl. Even though she's a girl, she's fairly relatable even for a guy. She, during a completely ordinary day, witnesses a girl getting shot and then accidentally discovers that she has an ability to rewind time. She then over the course of the game sees visions of the future, past and present, explores alternate timelines and realities, discovering many intertwined plots; an imminent catastrophe approaching, the disappearance of a girl, and a shady dynasty of powerful people in her hometown.\n\nThere are many characters in the story, and many people would probably see stereotypes at first glance, but talking to those characters in the game reveals more about them, just like in real life.\n\nOverallI've played thousands of hours of over 200 video games in my life. I've specifically looked for story-focused games that allow for choices and player impact on the story. This is one of my top five games of all time. Life Is Strange feels completely natural, all of the dialogue, voice acting, lip-synching, animation, facial expressions, are so well done that you don't even notice they've been done, it's like watching real life. The strings on the puppets are invisible, because these aren't puppets, they're people. The game deserved to be called a game too, because it actually does require skill. You need empathy to understand people, cleverness for using the time travel to it's fullest potential, and a deductive mind for solving the mystery. Every level can be explored to find stunning detail, and it's clear the developers spent a lot of time thinking about everything.\n\nThe game has almost no negative aspects to it. If there are any, it might be the occasional annoying moment of being stuck because you don't know what to do, but these situations are fairly rare and very rewarding when you do figure it out.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone even mildly interested in story-focused games, but anyone with an open heart can enjoy this.\n\n10/10.","August 10, 2015","true","12.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","9","13","3","0"

While the game focuses on Max's school life, it also sheds a light on her relationships and the mysterious disappearance of a local girl.\n\nAs Max, players navigate school life through a linear path, interacting with classmates, teachers and friends through choice-driven dialogue. But these decisions aren't set in stone; once a conversation is over, you can choose to "rewind" time. You can relive a scenario as often as you like with no consequence, though your powers only allow you to back up for a set amount of time.\n\nLet's talk about Life is Strange's most obvious hook: the do-over. We get this a lot in video games, but it's mostly used as a life-saving mechanic — rewinding to avoid spikey pits, fireballs or any number of cartoonish things. With Life is Strange, Dontnod created a world in which conversation is your greatest foe. I spent a great deal of time picking a path, rewinding, and tumbling down the other hole. But you know what? That didn't always make it easier. Sometimes, I found myself second and triple guessing my responses.\n\nI see great things coming for this game. I recommend this game!\n","July 27, 2015","true","334.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","4"

Life Is Strange isn't really a game, it's an interactive movie. Gameplay is limited to movement, rewind, and your investigative skills -- and that old statement of mine may seem weird, but it has held up as only one time in the entire game are you stripped of your ability to rewind and undo the consequence of failure. The entire package takes about 8-15 hours to complete once, depending on whether or not you try to investigate everything and read all the backstory literature on your first playthrough.\n\nHaving played through the game, I feel the creators have somewhat overhyped the importance of choice in this game. Seiken Densetsu 3 had more meaningful storyline branching. Life is Strange's story is ultimately linear, no matter if you're a paragon of virtue or a sociopath throughout the playthrough. What mid-game choices ultimately result in is "do X, get Y cutscene. Do V, get W cutscene". The most major potential difference is losing a 20-30 portion of the game, but the story inevitably goes in the same direction.\n\nSince the game is far more story than game, I need to tiptoe around the storyline to avoid spoiling it. The audio is fantastic, adds to the rich atmosphere of the game. Normally I'd be annoyed by the slow movement speed but again, since investigation and atmosphere are major aspects, it works for this game. The voice acting is pretty decent, my major complaint is the lips don't sync properly to the dialogue. (to the point of being distracting) The characters are a bit on the caricature side, with old and new teenage tropes mixed together, but that doesn't really bother me. This dialogue awkwardness seemed to be reduced in the later episodes.\n\nIn spite of its not-non linearity, Life is Strange still manages to be both epic and personal, heartwarming and cruel, comedic and heart wrenching. The writing is top notch, plot holes exist but aren't to the point of distracting, and it compelled me enough to do a second "jerkwad" playthrough after my first "friend of all living things" playthrough. I'll probably end up picking up the second season, but probably not until all episodes are released. (this title handles episodic well, but I'm binge-spoiled by Netflix)","June 23, 2015","true","21.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","10","15","3","0"

I had just one exception from the mass. Interesting to know.\n\nOverall rated the game is a great. It has a refreshing and interesting touch, plus is really worth the time and money as some professional reviewers have judged.\n\nI can agree with them and I really liked the sketchy but technically modern graphics (CSQAA / FXAA) based on Unreal 4 engine and I really loved the ambient soundtrack. The characters are stereotypes but well so close to real-life, somehow.\n\nThere were a few dislikes in this first season:\nTo be honest I hoped for far more decisions and it gets a bit obvious over time that the decisions sometimes can be "undone" by rewinding and sometimes not. Also in dialogues you have options but they don't really influence the game that much as the about 8-9 key situations the first season offers.\n\n- only 9 hours playing time for the Season 1 (other said they did it in just 3 hours)\n- controls on PC with a mouse are not that intuitive as it is designed for controllers / Xbox\n- some people report more or less severe issues but the staff has a fast pace responding at the Steam community. I can only file one bug as Fraps does not work with the game (taking screenshots will crash the game for me)\n- Graphics are okayish but bear in mind the game intentionally has a sketchy style.\n- most actions are not that carefully animated (playing guitar etc.) so in terms of motion capturing I've seen better things.\n- the really decisive decisions are not that numerous, and there should be more variants in the next seasons.\n\nBut well all the criticsm is moaning on a high level.\n\nThe first season of Life is Strange is a good pick for anyone that loves a short distraction and nicely made story.\nIf you are sure you could fell in love by slipping into the role of a teenager with super powers, changing the outcome of a story, then buy all seasons at once.\nOtherwise just try the first season. If you don't like adventures at all - hands off.\n\nLife is Strange deserves a 9/10, not just because I am a fan of such kind of games -\nand no, I am neither a pedo nor a photography loving hipster :)","February 3, 2015","true","9.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","2"

I play a lot of the Telltale games (highly recommended if you like this one), so my review isn't negative because there wasn't enough freedom or fighting or whatever. It's just that all of episode 5, especially the ending, was so, so, so bad. Avoiding spoilers, I'll just say that suspension of disbelief was not enough to fill the holes (explanation below). Overall, the game is still okay.\n\nExplanation:Was it the changes that Max made that caused the tornado, or was it the time travel itself? What about the other phenomena? If it was the time travel itself (which is possible through suspension of disbelief), then going back to allow Chloe to get shot would only make the storm worse. But at least her corpse would be safe underground from the tornado. On the other hand, it's not believable in any way that Chloe not being shot in the bathroom caused all of the following: the snow, the weird eclipse, the animals dying, and the tornado (I think I'm even leaving one out). If it just caused the storm, fine, but I won't be convinced that all of those things happened in a scientifically explicable way just because she didn't die. Another minor detail: Max's vision of the storm in ep. 1 was from the future? I thought her power was to rewind.","October 20, 2015","false","30.8"," 73 of 136 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","73","136","2","0"

I've invested a fair bit of time into Life is Strange, planed to even play it again once all the episodes were released. Praised it, recommended it to my friends, in my eyes this game was “Awesome”.\n\nIn many ways it is. The time traveling mechanics, the way choice-consequence is shown to the player, the story, the neat soundtrack, all of it is quite pleasant and worth the time and money. However the deal breaker is Episode 5.\n\nI will not go into details as to avoid spoilers but lets say that episode alone rendered my 23 hour experience into dust. The choices I made in the end didn't matter, the ending comes down to a press A or B and everything else you chose or considered through the entire game is discarded because of how the story goes.\n\nIn short, I don't recommend this game because of its poor ending.\nEpisode 1-4 is fine and pleasant, if you're really curious play them by all means but avoid Episode 5. The ending is nasty and destructive, I understand what the writers tried to do with it but it's still hard to swallow that as a proper way of ending the game.\n","October 20, 2015","false","23.6"," 124 of 234 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","124","234","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LousyOne/recommended/319630/","LousyOne","TheTrueParadoxe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LousyOne/","159 products in account","Now that I've played every episodes, I can finally give my final verdict for this game.\n\nLife is a strange is an episodic time-travel-teen-drama-choose-your-own-adventure. The time rewind mechanic is solid; it let's you rewind as much as you want, but for a limited 'reach'. There are some puzzles, but they are really basic. No, the game is mainly focused on story. Sadly, I think it is also where the game is at is weakest.\n\nLet's talk about the story; from the beginning, it had flaws. The lip-sync was atrocious, the dialogue was cheesier than a solid block of cheese and none of the character were particulary enjoyable, but it wasn't bad. The promise that choice mattered gave some weight to your action. As time went on, it became clear that the game just throws choice in your general direction, forget about it, then change the dialogue a tiny bit depending of your previous choice.\n\nLike Telltale's Walking dead,  the game relies on the illusion of choice, but, unlike Telltale's Walking dead, the illusion of choice is broken relatively early. The problem is linked to time travel in general; it automaticaly nullify the stakes. Whether or not a consequence happen, if it's bad enough, it probably will be fixed with more time travel. Nothing matter; time travel will fix it.\n\nSo choices, in a game of choice, aren't important in-universe and on a technical level.\n\nMy other problem with this game, as I've mentionned before, is related to the characters. None of them are really relatable or engaging.\n\n-There's Max, but she's so bland and constantly stating the obvious, feeling moved by her actions is hard work. She's too characterized as to serve only to represent the player, but not enough to stand on her own.\n\n-There's Chloe, she's clearly meant to be polarizing, but since she's constantly reminding you of all the time you were not some sort of loyal servant, its becomes harder and harder to care for her. They really nailed the rebel teenager, I just don't understand why the game has decided for me that Max has to like her and that they were now somehow ''besties''.  It really woudn't be so bad if she wasn't the game's most developed character. Or if the game didn't force you to be with her 75% of the time. Or if she was ever useful in any way.\n\n-There are other character, but they are mainly underdevelopped archetype. There's the rival with her followers, the bully, the nerd.... They rarely go beyond their initial settings.\n\nMy final problem is the ending. The whole episode 5, to be honest. I won't spoil anything, but it really fails to tie all loose ends. The core concepts of the game are given a backhanded explanation. Some parts don't feel like they belong at all.\nThe final decision is frankly insulting. You either have the most cliche tropes of time-travel or a straight up incomplete ending.\n\nAfter episode 4, I was hesitating to recommend this game. The flaw were unavoidable, but it was still an overall nice experience. The ending left a bittersweet taste that I cannot forget.\n\nIt's a choice-driven game, except choice are meaningless.\nIt's a story-driven game without good characters.\nIt's a time-travel game that can't seem to stay consistent.\nI can't recommend.","November 27, 2015","false","14.6"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","13","21","2","0"

The characters so far in the story are interesting, the plot more than holds its own it flat out impressed me.\n\nThe voice acting is alright I have no complaints aside from a little lip sync miss here or there. The interaction with other characters and the ability to explore is also nice and well done, and really adds to the overall immersion. The Graphics are very good, especially for this style of game.\n\nAnd the sound track fits the game perfectly, and really gives the game 'subtle ambient reinforcement' I recommend you give this game a try if you like anything from 'time travel ish' to sci fi/fantasy to adventure, because you will certainly enjoy this very immersive game. The next release (Episode 2) can't be released soon enough.\n\n******Small Update 3/15*******\n\nWith the release of Episode two the game continued to dazzle with its immersive story; mystery, and well thought out character design- and of amazing sound track and graphics. If you still haven't picked this game up. Make sure you give it a chance, and see Arcadia bay though makes eyes and her Camera Lense.\n\n*******Update Upon Finishing Spoilers*************\n\nWell, Life is strange; was quite an experience. The Story of Max and Chloe and co was very imerssive; and engaing; I honestly felt very attached to Chloe and to Max which made the hard choice even more 'hard' so to speak. With the Series now finished I must say I did feel a bit 'forced' in the Finale to pick one side of the Coin or the Other. So I made my choice and saved my 'Bae' The emotional and adventures ride and truly immersive story along with cast it was fun to get to know and interact with.  Due to feeling a bit forced with the final choice.. I wound up dropping my rating a bit but to each their own. final 8.5/10  Thanks for an enjoyable game -\n\nhttp://i61.tinypic.com/11ah09h.jpg","January 30, 2015","true","64.4"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","16","27","2","0"

You play as a young girl named Max, in school for photography. It does a good job at portraying modern youth but it does have a twist that you'll find out early into the game. With out saying too much that twist will play a fairly large role in the small instances of puzzle solving that's featured in episode one. You'll also be making choices through out the game and each choice will have an impact on the overall outcome.\n\nI'll be honest, I didn't really expect to like the game to much based solely on the theme of the game. I ended up getting it because of it's low price and great looking visuals. I really do like the art design in this game. I features an almost acrylic hand painted texture style that really carries the game's aesthetic.\n\nI'm glad I ended up getting it and playing it through. Life is Strange is well written, the characters, though typical in archetype, has a lot of depth. Both the main and supporting cast all show flaws, and strengths. Traits that may seem obvious, then get's contradicted by a story revel. It is the level of intricacies in each character that I enjoyed the most.\n\nOverall, Life is Strange is a surprising little gem. The theme might not be for every one, but what it does it does pretty well.\n\nPros:\n- Great art style\n- Unexpected turns\n- Fair payment model\n- Good characters\n\nCons:\n- The "Special ability" of this game is under used\n- Mechanically, it does nothing ground breaking","February 6, 2015","true","10.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I got it not really knowing what to expect, but this is now one of the best games I have ever played. The characters and story are simply fantastic and very creative. Decisions are hard and actually have meaning, and there will be instant regret. "WTF did I just do" was probably my most common thought during my playthrough. Presentation-wise, the visual style/graphics are great and really fit the game's theme, voice acting is top notch and conveys emotion amazingly well, and the soundtrack is absolutely perfect for this game (in my opinion at least :P). It is also very well optimized. Had no trouble running nearly everything maxed with a nVidia 660m.\nHonestly, I'm having trouble putting my experience into words, but I will say this: If you are big on story in games, or games where player choice matters heavily (and are not afraid of shedding a tear or two), this is the game for you. Simple as that. I cannot express my satisfaction enough. The team at DontNod have truly done an amazing job with this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/recommended/319630/","bastwood","Bastwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/","689 products in account","I like the concept of episodic games. Telltale Games' episodic efforts from 2006 onwards did their part in revitalizing the ailing adventure game genre. However, in order to reach a wider audience, the tricky, show-stopping puzzles gradually had to give room for more story-focused experiences that emphasized player choice and consequence.\n\nA yet unsurpassed high point was reached with 2012's The Walking Dead Season One, and since then we've seen other studios start to flex their episodic muscles as well. The strongest new contender in the field is definitely Dontnod Entertainment with Life is Strange.\n\nLife is Strange tells a refreshingly grounded story about a high school student who discovers she can turn back time. Despite featuring an apparent superpower, the scope and tone of the game are kept relatively unpretentious. Everything is happening in a small coastal town, with events unfolding in a very laidback fashion.\n\nLiS spends a lot of time building its atmosphere, succeeding admirably. The graphics are stylized but not cartoony, with several very well framed shots (photography is one the main subjects of the game, after all) that use color to great effect. The indie soundtrack cements the tone further with several wistful coming-of-age tunes.\n\nThe ability to rewind time allows for some occasional puzzles, but relationships with other people always take precedence over other mysteries. Life is Strange features some highly memorable supporting characters that you genuinely learn to loathe or love. There are some tough decisions to make especially during the midpoint of the season, which I felt was the strongest part of the game.\n\nAs Life is Strange moved to its final act the tone got way darker with skeletons tumbling out of the closets. I totally think the game earns the progression and the groundwork is laid well, but unfortunately the scope and theme veered too far into science fiction territory for my liking. The last episode felt very fragmented, trying to accomplish too much in too little time and forcibly nudging the game to be larger-than-life.\n\nThe conclusion of the series was still satisfactory, but with a stronger home stretch Life is Strange would have had a real shot at dethroning The Walking Dead. After all is said and done, as a whole LiS stands as one of the few truly great episodic games of recent years, a story totally worth experiencing, clearly crafted with love. Telltale needs to take notes; This is what the genre needs right now.","October 28, 2015","true","15.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It starts as a somewhat innocent seeming teenage-high school drama but builds layers upon layers as it progresses. A brooding, unsettling feeling is established very early on in the game. Not everything is quite right in the seemingly idyllic and sleepy Arcadia Bay, and not everyone is as they seem. Life is Strange explores the strength of friendship and the darkest depths of the human condition through the lens of an aspiring young photographer with a special gift that allows her to rewind time and try to do what we'd all like to: correct the mistakes of our past.\n\nThe game offers a tremendous amount of content to analyze and ponder in a thrilling, riveting mystery-adventure format featuring a touching coming of age story populated with interesting, multi-dimensional characters. These characters are developed naturally, rather than with clichéd exposition found in lesser narratives. Even very minor characters have the potential for interesting development depending on player interaction. These characters are clearly not only a product of their births, but also of their experiences.\n\nLife is Strange conducts itself with minimal moralizing and recognition of the complexities of human nature. Critiques by reactionary misogynists seem to be unfounded as strong, sympathetic male characters emerge over time (somewhat dependent on player choice). All the while it explores the very real dangers and abuses women suffer by the hands of some psychotic, entitled and insecure men.\n\nDecidedly less 'feminist' concerns such as bullying, corruption, man's ignorance and hubris towards our environment, and how society marginalizes its ill are also tackled masterfully. Topics within science and mysticism are a recurring theme and are handled in a balanced, mature manner and seemingly without much bias.\n\nEquipped with a fantastic, fitting and seamlessly immersive soundtrack including Indie selections and original compositions from Jonathan Morali, excellent (for the most part) voice acting and a beautiful, handpainted feel to the visuals. Technical mishaps (most notably the lip syncing in earlier episodes - *now fixed in a recent patch*) have been vastly improved upon in later episodes.\n\nWhile still early, this could very well be one of the greatest games ever made and is definitely one of the strongest showpieces for video games as art. The unique impact of LiS could not be replicated by any other medium and shows how interactivity is critical to the poignancy and transcendent qualities of this artform when it is at its finest.\n\nHighly recommended\n\n*A couple of quick notes on EP 5 that I will rewrite into the review at a later date:\n+ Two emotional 'grey' endings. Somewhat 'predictable' (I prefer to say 'foreshadowed' - how else would it end?). Thankfully no cop out 'happy endings' that insult the player's intelligence with a Hitchcockian explanation of the phenomena and choices in the game (juxtapose with the ending of the Hitchcock film 'Psycho' - the psychoanalysis). Could have really used a plant influenced ending though, clearly not watering the plant and letting it die should have turned the storm into a nuclear holocaust. ;)\n+ Phenomenal art direction, particularly in the nightmare / penultimate segment.\n+ Themes and philosophical content remained consistently poignant (lack of taking sides on religion / science, environmental concerns etc)\n- Minor quibbles with some of the antagonist's dialogue and actions near the beginning but developed well.

"New game! Telltale like! You gonna like it if you like theirs games!" - he said, "COOL!" I replied in my mind. After 3 minutes into gameplay (literally after first action in class) I closed the video, head strait to buy it via Steam.\n\nAnd at this point, my blessing and curse really began. This game is story + atmosphere far in its shadows is whole rest. Rest is just a background to blow you mind. Prepare to take serious hits right in the feels.\n\nEpisode 1-2: Beautifully crafted nostalgic atmosphere. Fell in love in Chloe in 0.67 seconds. Everything I done, I done for her.\n\nEpisode 3: Ending crushed my balls. I was so shocked that i started to shout on the monitor. http://9gag.com/gag/ao07QQn\n\nEpisode 4: I thought I'm tough. But not this time. First choice of this episode melted my heart. I couldn't do it. Rachel destroyed EVERYTHING I knew about this game. My soul was teared apart. Ending... Can't even... http://9gag.com/gag/aAp0r5g\n\nExpectations for episode 5 was so high that I was worried. I was worried that Dontnod couldn't deliver another episode with higher quality or at least as good as episode 4, and I started to feel disappointment in advance... 100 theories about everything, so much time waiting... And finally... Episode 5 is out.\n\nEpisode 5: I don't even know where to start. Seriously. My obvious theories covered... Like first 3 minutes of story. Those time travels and twists... Every twist comes with shock, bigger than the previous. Jaw drops with unrecognizable noises. That nightmare... I felt like the old days - Max Payne nightmare. It was a nightmare in which I believed. "Ok, girl... It's enough for you... You're not THAT strong. I'll slowly let you fall apart... Just like me now..." - I said in my mind. She would, but right after that Chloe appeared and saved the day. My last choice? No. I couldn't do it. I done the same what Joel did for Ellie in Last of Us. It wasn't easy though. I saw another ending and I know that was suppose to be "true" ending. Natural way to fix everything. I would save Chloe anyways. I couldn't live with such a loss for the rest of my life. http://9gag.com/gag/adpdwqD\n\nNow? Now I'm devastated. You are all alive in my story, but I know we will never meet again. I love you and I miss you girls.\n\nThat is the price of a good story.","October 20, 2015","true","30.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

I honestly cannot recommend this game enough.\n\nKinda longish review\nI just beat this and all I can say is what a ride it's been. Serious props to the team at DontNod for making this gem. I got it not really knowing what to expect, but this is now one of the best games I have ever played. The characters and story are simply fantastic and very creative. Decisions are hard and actually have meaning, and there will be instant regret. "WTF did I just do" was probably my most common thought during my playthrough. Presentation-wise, the visual style/graphics are great and really fit the game's theme, voice acting is top notch and conveys emotion amazingly well, and the soundtrack is absolutely perfect for this game (in my opinion at least :P). It is also very well optimized. Had no trouble running nearly everything maxed with a nVidia 660m.\nHonestly, I'm having trouble putting my experience into words, but I will say this: If you are big on story in games, or games where player choice matters heavily (and are not afraid of shedding a tear or two), this is the game for you. Simple as that. I cannot express my satisfaction enough. The team at DontNod have truly done an amazing job with this. (Thanks DontNod! :D) I've seen it on sale quite a bit both here and other sites, so if you want to wait, you probably won't have to wait too long. Again, highly recommended! Amazing experience.","October 30, 2015","true","22.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I say ‘experience’, because Life is Strange is a real mix between game, story and movie. They creators have taken the best things from those three things and combined them into a game where the choices you make throughout the whole story influence everything that will happen after you have made that choice. And with the power of Max, turning back small portions of time, they have given you… doubt… Did you make the right choice? Should I rewind and make a different one? What will be the effect?\n\nMax is a typical teenager, but while witnessing the murder of a girl in the bathroom of her school, she gains the ability to rewind time and this gives her the chance to change events, minor and major ones.\n\nThe story she gets herself into goes from normal teenage drama (do people like me? Do I fit in?), to a psychological drama (the disappearance of a girl and the state of depression of another) and the end of a city because of the scariest tornado you can think of.\n\nChoices you have to make are hard and while you think it might be the good one, you always have this nagging feeling something bad will happen because of it. And you might be right about that!\n\nThe story reminds me of the movie ‘The Butterfly Effect’ (you know, the only movie where Ashton Kutcher could actually deliver a perfect role).\n\nI recommend people to play the game one episode at a time. I think that makes the experience even better, because you will think about the choices you have made and gives you time to really ‘feel’ the story.\n\nI started playing as soon as episode one was released and played the game episode by episode while they were released. And I decided to write this review only after finishing the game to make sure I wasn’t biased by endings of episodes.\n\nNow that I have finished the story I can only say it was completely worth every minute, penny, agony and doubtful moments this game has cost me. And while others might b**ch and moan about the ending, this couldn’t have gone otherwise! I think people will need some time to think about it and, like the ending of Soprano’s and the ending of the non-Hollywood cut of The Butterfly Effect, then agree that it couldn’t have gone otherwise.\n\nSince I have started playing I haven’t been able to put this game out of my head and I haven’t been able to shut up about it in conversations with friend and co-workers. This game deserves to be game of the year and more.\n\nHopefully the team at Dontnod will be able to surprise us with their next project just as much as they have with Life is Strange, and no, I do not want a season two… That would be a mistake (or at least, I think it would be a mistake to try and top this one).","October 20, 2015","true","19.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

A few key points in the plot will be seen from a mile away, and you'll think to yourself: Anyone could have seen this coming. However, that doesn't mean this game has no surprises, especially because it's a "Choices matter" kind of experience.\n\nWithout spoiling much about the characters either, the only real problem I had with this game was Chloe, your run of the mill, angsty, punk rock clothes wearing, stereotypical I-hate-my-life-so-much-and-I-also-dye-my-hair-blue rebel... Well, at least she is for the first two chapters, from there on she actually starts to show good reason for being somewhat of a nuisance for everyone in her life, and, even if little by little, work towards improving her attitude. And THEN the game becomes really good, way better than it already was.\n\nAll in all, this game could give Telltale a run for its money. If you have the ~20 hours (at least that's how much it took me to complete the game and get all the achievements) to spare of your week, definitely give this game a go, I am sure you will not regret it.","November 4, 2015","true","20.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The best example when this happens is Life is Strange. Definitely my game of the year 2015, and alot better than the Telltale series. For my review I've waited for the release for the 5th and therefore last episode.\n\nThe story starts calmly, you get to know the characters and you're allowed to browse in the protagonists diary, learn everything about her life and hobby and take some pictures or talk with your classmates. You just try to be part of the whole typical school life we all have (or had once). Until the next episode starts and you feel like your emotions are going from 0 to 100, you have to make tough decisions no one of us wants to make and live with the consequences. Till the end you're wondering things like "Why?" "How could you?" "I thought". Who's looking for difficult puzzles, action and challenges is wrong here, Life is Strange is all about dialogues, decisions and a catching story.\n\n++ atmospheric and incredibly emotional soundtrack, the part at the end of every episode always gives me the creeps\n++ interesting (and easy to handle) implementation of a time travel feature, which establishes new options to carry on an conversation. Do you regret what you just said? Did you missed something and you can't go back? Here you can try out everything you want, be the best friend, be the weirdo or the evil bit...\n++ breathtaking and intoxicating story, you'll abandon your own theories pretty fast\n++ incredibly adorable (and lesser adorable of course) characters, it's easy to pick a favorite and you're not forced into a settled way, romance, whatever\n++ beautiful graphics, especially for people who dislikes Telltales comic style\n++ really tough and confusing decisions, like "Do I have to water this plant? And the next day too?"\n++ very detailed and lively world, you can interact with almost everything and get some additional information or a pointed remark from the main character\n\nThe very last decision feels like the hardest bossfight you ever had. There is no right "choice", like which decision is the better one, just with which decision you can learn to live. An impressive experience and the emotionally most touching game I've ever played.\n\nAnd at last one of my favorite quotes from the game: "FIND MY CAT PIX. PLEASE. MY HEART IS BROKEN."\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDas beste Beispiel wenn Computerspiele zur Kunst werden. Defitiniv mein Spiel des Jahres 2015, übertrifft die Telltale Games noch um Längen. Für mein Review hab ich den Release der 5. und somit letzten Episode abgewartet.\n\nDu tauchst entspannt in eine ruhige Story ein, lernst die Charaktere kennen, darfst im Tagebuch der Protagonistin stöbern, ihrem Hobby nachgehen und Fotos schießen und versuchen ein Teil dieses typischen Schullebens zu werden. Bis du in den nächsten Episoden von 0 auf 100 geschmissen wirst, extreme Entscheidungen treffen und mit deren Konsequenzen leben musst. Und damit meine ich du trägst deine Entscheidungen bis zum Ende mit dir rum, sie werden dir immer wieder vor Augen gehalten und du wirst mit den Fragen konfrontiert. "Warum?" "Wie konntest du?" "Ich dachte". Wer schwere Rätsel, Action und Herausforderungen sucht, ist hier falsch. Life is Strange lebt von den Dialogen und der Geschichte.\n\n++ stets stimmige und fantastische Musik und Sounduntermalung\n++ interessante Umsetzung eines Zeitreise Features, welches einem neue Möglichkeiten sich zu unterhalten eröffnet und ein tolles Gameplay bietet. Bereust du was du gesagt hast? Hast du etwas übersehen und kannst nicht zurück? Hier schon\n++ atemberaubende und mitreißende Story, eigene Theorien werden schnell über Bord geschmissen\n++ unglaublich sympathische (und weniger sympathische natürlich) Charaktere, man findet schnell seine Favoriten und wird nicht direkt in eine vorgegebene Richtung geschoben\n++ wunderschöne Grafik, gerade für Leute die Telltales Comicstil nicht besonders mögen\n++ äußerst harte Entscheidungsmöglichkeiten, teilweise bei nebensächlichen Handlungen, nur um einen zu verunsichern\n++ sehr detailierte lebendige Welt, man kann sich so ziemlich alles ansehen und erhält Zusatzinfos oder mal einen spitzen Kommentar der Protagonistin\n\nDie allerletzte Entscheidung wirkt wie der härteste Bossfight vor dem man je stand. Es gibt keine "Wahl", keine Entscheidung die besser oder schlechter als die andere ist. Nur mit welcher man besser leben kann. Eine beeindruckende Erfahrung und das emotional bewegendste Spiel welches ich bisher spielen durfte. Ein großes JA zur Kaufempfehlung.\n\nZum Schluss eines meiner Lieblingszitate aus dem Spiel: "FIND MY CAT PIX. PLEASE.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/duszynski/recommended/319630/","duszynski","A Star in Darkness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/duszynski/","155 products in account","Life is Strange is about two teenagers, Max and Chloe, who were childhood friends, coming together to solve a mystery. A girl named Rachel Amber has gone missing and Chloe is the most determined person in Arcadia Bay to find her. Meanwhile, Max keeps having visions of a tornado destroying Arcadia Bay and she also discovers that she has the power to rewind time and change actions/outcomes.\n\nThe game mechanics involve exploring various settings and making important decisions that affect the game's story. The graphics are awesome and many times very beautiful.  The soundtrack was fitting, as it features many indie music groups and artists, and Max attends Blackwell Academy, which is an prestigious art and science school.\n\nI really enjoyed seeing diversity in this game. There were some people of color. I, personally, would've liked to have seen more than just a few people of color, but at least it isn't a completely whitewashed game. There were a few overweight characters, which is definitely a rarity. Usually, everyone is thin and "perfect"-looking unless they're a villain or comic relief character. Then, of course, there's the same-sex undertone between Max and Chloe, and also Chloe and Rachel.\n\nGame Analysis (MAJOR SPOILERS):\nAs you come to find out at the end of Episode 4, Mr. Jefferson is the main villain. He's been kidnapping young women and using them against their will for his vision of "innocence" in his photography. There are a few clues that could've led you to that conclusion earlier. In his lecture, during Episode 1, he talks about taking any one of his students and capturing them in a moment of vulnerability. In Episode 2, the biggest clue is the binders with women's names on them. There are several of them. But we only know about Rachel Amber's disappearance. This means that whoever is responsible for Rachel Amber's disappearance and Kate Marsh's blackout experience has to be someone new to Arcadia Bay. Max later confirms that the only missing people reports filed recently have to do with Rachel Amber, so where are those other girls from? They couldn't be from Arcadia Bay. As the game mentions, Mr. Jefferson only recently became a faculty member at Blackwell Academy.\n\nAs we find out in Episode 4, Rachel Amber was murdered. My guess is that Max gets her rewind powers from Rachel Amber's spirit, who is represented by the doe. The thing that really convinces me of this is how the doe shows up in the foreground when Chloe and Max discover Rachel's body. The doe also had appeared at the very beginning of the game, when Max is trekking through the storm to the lighthouse, and leads her through it.\n\nI think the game developers had fun "trolling" the Gamergate community. There are several instances of terminology being used that Gamergate members would use. Daniel has a shirt that has a fedora-wearing neck-beard man who says "m'lady" ironically. There's a poster on Warren's dorm room door that (probably) Nathan put there with terms like, "beta phag" on it. Later on, Warren talks about being "alpha" and not a "beta nerd." Then, in the nightmare world, Warren refers to himself as a "white knight." I guess this is what Gamergate gets for flipping out over two female main characters.\n\nSo ... the endings. Well, I have to agree with the majority. I was a little disappointed with the endings. While the developers have stated that there is no canon ending, I must say that I do think there is an ending they prefer to be canon. I think they want the player to sacrifice Chloe. The "sacrifice Chloe" choice leads to a much longer, detailed ending. The "sacrifice Arcadia Bay" choice leads to a very short guilt trip scene of Max and Chloe driving through the destroyed town. Speaking of guilt tripping, in the nightmare sequence, there's the last part where it's the diner filled with Arcadia Bay inhabitants who are begging Max to not let them die. To me, the message of this game was "one can be sacrificed for the greater good" even though by that logic, Chloe deserves to die and I don't agree with that at all.\n\nRegardless of flaws though, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys story-rich games and choices that affect the game's story.","November 28, 2015","true","44.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The animation and artwork is incredible.  The voice acting is spot-on and the writing is witty and compelling. This game is quite simply ... amazing.  Gorgeous even. And a LOT of fun.

This one has an interesting mechanic, one you almost certainly know about, in which the main character can turn back time and undo decisions meaning you can replay conversations and change your answers. There are a couple of reasons why I like this; occasionally in TellTale games I would regret the choice pick (or accidentally select one I didn't mean to) and wouldn't want to reload my save just to go back. The second is that I like to explore as much as I can in these type of games. For example, in The Walking Dead, you pick one option and the conversation moves on whereas here, you can go back and explore, meaning you hear more dialogue and learn little extras about the characters. Also I am a huge baby who does not like upsetting fictional characters.\n\nSpeaking of which, I will be honest, the lines can occasionally be pretty cringy, especially in the first episode with a few phrases such as 'waaambulance' and 'noob' being thrown around a few times. Despite this, I really like the cast, especially since it's mostly women and am engaged enough to see where their stories go.\n\nOne thing I will say that I didn't like at first and am currently on the fence on is the mouse controls. To interact with objects, you look at them, where your cursor is placed inside a circle with icons such as interact/examine/etc. You then press down mouse 1 and drag the mouse to which you'd like to pick and at first I thought the game was broken because I couldn't figure it out. This however feels like a minor complaint and is most likely me just being dumb than the game's fault.\n\nAll I can hope for is that the ending doesn't turn bad, especially since this is a story regarding the sudden ability of time-travel.","May 27, 2015","true","34.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

This game is one hell of an emotional roller coaster. The first two episodes pull you into this adorable teenage photographer's life and her past. The last three episodes punch you in the face with choices that will alter the timeline you currently reside on, some good some bad. They all add up to one ultimatum. An ultimatum which will crawl into your eyeballs and pull out the little tears you have because you're a manly man that doesn't cry. But you will cry. And you'll laugh. And you'll think really hard about yourself and why you care so much about a fictional character. Eventually you'll be happy again, but the feel train comes back around every so often. And feels you will have.\n\ntl;dr: 10/10 Endings could of been a little better, but I can't stop thinking about it and I am extremely confident in         saying it's the best game I ever played.","January 18","true","19.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

However, the soundtrack  composed by Jonathan Morali of the band Syd Matters, adds a very cool vibe to the whole thing.\n\nThe choice and consequence aspect of the game adds an interesting playability, especially when combined with the option of rewinding and choosing yet more options.\n\nRecommended, if only to support indy game developers.

But that's bullcrap. Don't let that affect your decision on getting this game. This isn't only a game, in one of the few times that I say this, it crosses the line between just playing and seeing/influencing true art. Some characters you might wanna appeal to and some not. But is that really what you want? All is your choice and it's hella worth it. I wish there were other words to make you get this game, but there simply aren't any right ones. It was seriously hard for me to go and play this one again because I remember how much I cried the first time (several times in the story actually.) It simply WAS worth it.\n\nSoundtrack is amazing. Voice acting makes it all feel so realistic you'll get lost between what's real and what's not. Though the graphical side of this game doesn't focus on looking authentic, it certainly does evoke many feelings. Like true art. Life is Strange stays with me forever.

At the time I finished it, I wish I had never played it. I held no malice towards it, I simply wish it was not a thing that had happened to catch my eye. It hurt me. I fell in love with the characters especially, but everything about it, from the visuals to the soundtrack, was just amazing. And when it ended, I lost all of that, and it hurt. Both going back to my own disappointing life, and the memory of how my time in this one ended.\n\nIn this world, there's no turning back time. So much of Life Is Strage was about rewinding the past and changing what you didn't like for the better, but here you can only change the present. This experience was unique, even formative. After finishing this game, I wished I could go back to Arcadia Bay, and have things turn out differently. But I couldn't lie to myself like that. The scars were there to stay.

And there is a kind of magic in the way the game brings to life the main characters Max and Chloe, with their feelings, emotions, personal dramas, contradictions, memories, dreams, fears and choices.\n\nAlso the supporting  characters are well conceived, and they contribute, along with a high level of attention in detailing Blackwell Academy and Arcadia Bay, the places in which the story is set, to the feeling that while playing you are inside a rich and believable environment, with hints of real life happening everywhere.\n\nFrom an artistic point of view the graphic style, with its “painted” colors and careful photography, is a perfect match for the nostalgic mood of the game… as is the soundtrack, which is a fantastic set of atmospheric songs, both delicate and powerful in lyrics and music, that really enhance your emotional perception of the game.\n\nLife is Strange is a story about so many things. Just to name a few, friendship and love, choices and consequences, liberty and fate, good and evil, childhood and youth, dreams and reality, conquest and loss, who you are and who you pretend to be, happiness and despair… in other words it is a story about Life, in the deepest and richest meaning of the term.\n\nBelieve me, this is a game that will give you much, much more than you dare to expect. For you, lucky people who have yet to play Life is Strange, I do hope that you will gradually let yourself go in living the story of Max and Chloe, let your emotions flow freely… and you’ll obtain in return a richness that will stay with you for long after you’ve finished the game.\n\nYou will understand what I'm saying when you’ll get there; in the meanwhile, I am sure you will enjoy the trip.","January 27","true","30.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I cannot recommend it highly enough. Seriously, it is my favourite game of all time by far. But it is hard to explain what makes Life is Strange great without spoiling all those incredible things.\nTo start, Life is Strange is beautiful art as much as it is a game. Visually, the hand-drawn aesthetic builds a wonderful atmosphere along with the cartoonish but charming particle effects and rich lighting.\nThe soundtrack also deserves recognition because it was simply fantastic.\nThe gameplay was focused around choices and the protagonist's ability to rewind time. This allows you to remake every choice in the game and see where all your options lead, but the rewind was limited to just the last few moments, so you must consider the future and live with the consequences of your actions later. The game has mechanics similar to that of Gone Home, where the player is free to explore and hunt for hidden clues. The world is just bursting with hidden content just waiting to be noticed and throughout the game you are encouraged to take your time and experience everything and interact with everyone.\nInitially the story feels like a generic teen school drama, but don't let that put you off; it quickly spirals down somewhere deeper and darker. The game made me feel awful. More than once, too. The endings are so powerful I was raging at multiple points in the game. I was angry for a whole day after I finished the game. It hits you out of nowhere and brings out emotions like regret, guilt, and depression that you never thought video games could. Life is Strange is powerful and compelling; there is so much more to say, but anything not super vague is a major spoiler. In fact, stay away from the trailers, most reviews, and pretty much any forum about the game; they are full of spoilers. Just take my word (and the other bazillion positive reviews), and give this game a shot if you have even enjoyed any sort of adventure game and any sort of narrative, because this is the best one there is. Besides, Episode 1 is only $5 even without any sale.\nCalling Life is Strange a "game" almost diminishes its value; it contains beauty and themes like no other game I have experienced. I cannot recommend this higher.","January 30","true","19.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This one has an interesting mechanic, one you almost certainly know about, in which the main character can turn back time and undo decisions meaning you can replay conversations and change your answers. There are a couple of reasons why I like this; occasionally in TellTale games I would regret the choice pick (or accidentally select one I didn't mean to) and wouldn't want to reload my save just to go back. The second is that I like to explore as much as I can in these type of games. For example, in The Walking Dead, you pick one option and the conversation moves on whereas here, you can go back and explore, meaning you hear more dialogue and learn little extras about the characters. Also I am a huge baby who does not like upsetting fictional characters.\n\nSpeaking of which, I will be honest, the lines can occasionally be pretty cringy, especially in the first episode with a few phrases such as 'waaambulance' and 'noob' being thrown around a few times. Despite this, I really like the cast, especially since it's mostly women and am engaged enough to see where their stories go.\n\nOne thing I will say that I didn't like at first and am currently on the fence on is the mouse controls. To interact with objects, you look at them, where your cursor is placed inside a circle with icons such as interact/examine/etc. You then press down mouse 1 and drag the mouse to which you'd like to pick and at first I thought the game was broken because I couldn't figure it out. This however feels like a minor complaint and is most likely me just being dumb than the game's fault.\n\nAll I can hope for is that the ending doesn't turn bad, especially since this is a story regarding the sudden ability of time-travel.","May 27, 2015","true","34.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

It's an apropos message, because I absolutely did cry. A raw, shuddering, and terribly viscous affair. Life is Strange is that kind of game. However, the subversion of 'playing' is germane in another way, which DONTNOD probably didn't intend. Because they clearly prioritized the story, and its emotional impact, over engaging gameplay. The reciprocal message encountered at the beginning of each episode declares the game to be about meaningful choice, and, at the risk of being crass, that's marketing BS.\n\nTruthfully, the decisions you make are mostly window dressing. You will experience nearly the same story as everyone else, with minor nuance. The game only occasionally attempts to leverage its identity as a video game to its advantage, and in most cases, it is clumsy and halfhearted. The majority of puzzles are weak, usually being arbitrary in conception, and insubstantial in implementation. There are few occasions where the decisions made have real, lasting impact, and you are never given agency to act outside the narrative corridor you are forced down. This is not uncommon to certain genres, but that's not what most players felt they were promised. However, it is my belief that if you are prepared to forgive the game its shortcomings, and set your expectations appropriately, you will be rewarded with a rich, incisive, moving, and eminently worthwhile experience. If you're into that kind of thing.\n\nThe story revolves around Max Caulfield (Hannah Telle), an 18 year old girl returning to Arcadia Bay, the small Oregon town where she grew up, after having moved to Seattle five years prior. She has returned to enroll in a prestigious private High School, Blackwell, hoping to kickstart her passion for photography into a burgeoning career by enrolling in the program directed by the acclaimed artist Mark Jefferson (Derek Phillips). But Life is Strange (hah!), and it seems that God, destiny, chance, the Spirit of the Land, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster have decided Max be granted the ability to alter time, as she discovers in a moment of frightening duress.\n\nShe soon reunites with her childhood friend, Chloe (Ashly Burch), and together they begin an investigation into the disappearance of Rachel Amber, a local girl who vanished 6 months prior. But as they learn more, and Max experiments with her new powers, things only become more complicated. Who can they trust? What is the meaning of the impossible phenomena that plague the town? Who are the Prescotts, and what are they up to? Why did SquareEnix think it was a good idea to plug a terrible fourteen year old movie, in one of the most ham-fisted attempts of petulant propaganda I've ever seen?\n\nThe game is nominally a mystery, but truthfully, it's more science fiction tale, and in my estimation a damned good one. It hearkens back to a lot of the books I read growing up (it's no accident Ray Bradbury is name-dropped repeatedly), and has a lot of similarities to similar explorations of time travel, memory, or both. Touchstones include Donny Darko, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the Butterfly Effect, and To the Moon. It explores intriguing and provocative ideas in an intelligent way, but with a strident focus on character development.\n\nI initially cringed at Max's character, but by the end of the game, I was deeply invested in her. If there is a benefit to Life is Strange being a video game rather than a TV show or movie, the proof is in Max. She is given personality and life by blending the intimacy of text, the expressiveness of animation, and the empathetic characterization of voice acting, while allowing you to co-habitate the space she does. You can't do all of that in any other medium, and it works well.\n\nHer dialogue is good, but even more effective is the journal, where she writes her personal thoughts on the plot, as it develops. It's a more compelling read than a summarization of events you just experienced has any right to be. The graphic artists are able to give her character mostly through broad body language, as they simply don't have the tools for facial nuance, but it is still an effective presentation, and one that succeeds due to Telle's portrayal of Max's pain, anxiety, joy, and eventual growth. These all come together to give the game the emotional core it needs. Because you can only guide her, Max ends up as one of the stronger protagonists in gaming, simply because she has her own personality, rather than being a blank slate for the player to inhabit. There is little more bittersweet about Life is Strange than that we probably won't ever see any more Max Caulfield.\n\nPlaying Lois Lane to your Superman is Ashly Burch's Chloe, who is difficult to countenance for the first two and a half episodes. It's a tall order to present a petulant, irresponsible, and selfish teenager, and expect the average player to identify with her. Incredibly, Burch does accomplish this, persevering until  given the chance to redeem the character with some truly raw and deeply affecting performances. The end result is a character you like not just because of who she is, but of who she clearly will be. You want to watch her to grow, and achieve the great potential she has.\n\nThe rest of the cast is comprised mostly of one-note characters, such as the nerds, the jocks, the preppies, the hippies, the conservatives, the punks, etc. etc. A few stand out, like the performance of the drug dealer Frank (Daniel Bonjour), or that of Phillips' Jefferson, but even more important is the town of Arcadia Bay, represented by greasy spoons, woods both dark and adventurous, cold beaches, and comforting domiciles. I have to say that I certainly would not mind more games set in the Pacific Northwest during Fall.\n\nThe graphics are not flashy, but they are emotive, focused more on lighting, color, and mood, than verisimilitude. Very much like a movie. The sound design is especially persuasive, featuring an unusually potent implementation of diegetic music. The soundtrack was carefully selected to provide a calm, contemplative ambiance appropriate to the quiet, nostalgic, connotation most people ascribe to the Pacific Northwest. This introspective mood is closely entwined with the introverted Max, as she uses the music to center herself, or to bond with others. This gives a casual feel to the majority of the game, inviting you to set your own pace while you unravel the mysteries of Arcadia Bay.\n\nWhile it would have been nice for the game to have a few more ideas on how to engage the player with meaningful interaction, I feel the story and humanity imbuing it to more than make up for this, making it easy to recommend, regardless of its flaws. However, before I finish this review, I must briefly discuss the ending. Episode Five was the dealbreaker for a lot of players, so I feel a warning is in order. Remember, your decisions do not truly matter. Do not expect they will. If you are prepared for this, perhaps you will appreciate the story as much as I have. It's not perfect, but I think it's efficacious, giving additional meaning and depth to the entirety of what came before, and completing Max's character arc. I even think it's rather clever for a game that explores the possibility of predestination to have the ending be circumscribed.\n\nLife is Strange is not a uniformly cheerful game. It's full of loss, regret, and darkness. But darkness is only given meaning by light, and so those moments of pain and powerlessness give rise to lessons of acceptance, perseverance, and the importance of memories, good and bad. 'Don't take people for granted' the game tells you. 'Live life to the fullest.' It's a story worthy of the telling, a powerful memory in which we call can share, left to us by the creativity, imagination, emotion, and hard work of those who gifted it to us.","March 25","true","27.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

He was tired of doing the same thing over and over again.

When I think about this game I get goosebumps, and yet, I cannot really say this is the masterpiece everyone is talking about. Just to be clear, this is an awesome game, a gaming experience I'd recommend to anyone... but at least in my book, a masterpiece is something else.\n\nLet's start with the mechanics: Life is Strange is the love child of all the Telltale games, a wonderful narrative experience but finally with a (little) bit of the good old puzzles. Nothing too hard to figure out, but it's definitely a start for all the graphic adventures fans out there. Maybe this is the step in the right direction we were all waiting for, maybe the future of graphic adventures starts here. I sure hope so. Max's power can be tricky, and the first couple of times it can be challenging to understand exactly what to do. Sadly, after that it's always the same thing.\n\nAbout the setting: I hated the setting, but that's probably me, and it does not compromise the enjoyment of playing Life is Strange. Maybe I'm too old for these games, maybe I'm just an arid person, I don't know xD but I often find the game is trying way too hard to play the teenager/internet generation card, falling almost always into boring stereotypes. Or maybe it just does not resonate with me.\n\nThe story: Now this is different. The actual chain of events and the way they are fed to the player cannot be described in any other way than MAJESTIC. The narrative experience is just over the top, beautifully crafted and it flows naturally from the first frame to the last. The game tackles some of the most important and problematic issues of the newer generations, from bullying to euthanasia, and in some way even omosexuality and religion. Everything is always tasteful, even when extremely sad and making a choice becomes really hard, but to be completely honest I also feel that it never really adds anything to the table. Not that it would be a strict requirement, obviously, but then, remember what I said about masterpieces? Life is Strange succeeds 100% in creating an emotional bond between the player and the protagonists, to deliver a highly enjoyable, very well written, emotionally powerful (incredibly powerful) narrative experience.\n\nThe choices: another great thing. The game is full of choices, and even a small detail can have a huge impact down the way, creating a high re-playability value. Another big improvement from the Telltale games.\n\nThe graphics: I put the graphics in the end because I don't really care about it, generally. Graphics are nice, nothing extraordinary, technically speaking, more than once it happened to me to listen to dialogues without the model even moving its lips, but it's not that big of a deal to me. Art direction? That's a totally different matter, and Life is Strange excels in it. The game art style, the composition of the different shots, everything contributes to deliver the right vibe in every situation. A+\n\nTo make it painfully short: Garden State meets Donnie Darko meets Telltale Games.\n\nRecommended. It's awesome.","February 9","true","16.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You play the role as Max Caulfield, a photography student in Blackwell Academy. After Max discovers that she could rewind time after saving a girl from being shot in the girl's bathroom, she tries to unravel and understand the mystery of her unique "gift". Her choices now shape the past,  the present and the future.\n\nThe world of Life Is Strange is incredibly beautiful. Though its not that much of an open-world, the space that you can wander is already big enough to tease the player of exploring every corner of this gorgeous world. The graphics are also nice. The characters are well developed as you find yourself wondering at some times what happened to that certain character. Interaction with the characters is fun and exciting as it let's you get to know the characters themselves as you progress through the story The cutscenes are also well executed. From the great voice-acting to its emotion-packed soundtracks, the game gives-off a TV series feel that not all story-driven games can do.\n\nLife Is Strange's gameplay is quite different from that of Telltale Games. Unlike Telltale Games, Life Is Strange exposes the player into its own world, giving the player the chance to wander around. Your decisions not only affect the rest of the story but also how the other characters treat you, trust you and believe you. But even after choosing a decision, you can always rewind back time if you didn't like your current decision or if you want to weigh the reactions of the decision you chose. Another thing that makes decisions tough in Life Is Strange is that a Max monologue always plays after you make your decision and those monologues always sways the player to think again.\n\nPros:\n+ Great Soundtrack\n+ Great Voice-acting\n+ Nice Graphics\n+ Well-written Story\n+ Choices Matter\n\nCons:\n-\n\nMy Personal Rating:Gameplay: 9/10\nStory/Plot: 10/10\nMusic: 10/10\nGraphics:  9/10\n\nOverall Rating: 9.5/10\n\nI recommend this game to players who love story-driven games. The game is really worth the money and time. This is a MUST buy. Can't wait for a possible season 2! :D ..","November 10, 2015","true","25.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

Movies, series and games are usually something I enjoy to get my mind of things or to just get some rage out of my system. But this game….It learned me what a ‘emotional rollercoaster’ actually is.\n\nIn the game you play a young girl/woman by the name of Max. She is a general hipster kind of person who want to become a photographer and moved back to  her childhood town to study at Blackwell Academy. Starting at the beginning of the game, certain events will happen and you will find out that you have the power to mess with time. A interesting concept but not the greatest thing this game has to offer (Mind you the time mechanics are still very good, other things are simply even better). I will not spoil any of the story details but when you are playing you can expect to be: Gasping for air in surprise, smiling with joy to your screen and (I’ll be man enough to admit this) fight back a tear once in awhile. Those different emotions are what makes this game so amazing. The story, characters and voice acting are so well done that they will grab you, tear you along and spit you out just to do it all over again in the next episode.\n\nI’m aware that there are movies, series and books claim to do this. I agree that there are some books and movies around that can make people think or feel certain things. However its a set story, you cannot change or alter it. You can just read or watch along and hope all will end well. This game ads the power of interaction. You will constantly have to make decisions and those will have major (and unforeseen) consequences throughout the entire game (choices from episode 1 still mather in episode 2, 3, 4, and 5). This is what truly got me and what no game or movie ever achieved before. When I finished a episode I would just be staring to the end credits, and later the menu screen. Wondering if I choose the right things and what impact those might have in the episodes to come.\n\nAs for some technical things:\nThe soundtrack is amazing\nThe art in this game is amazingly well done\nVoice acting / story are 10+ (specially with the killer soundtrack)\nI took about 4 hours per episode (so A total of 20 hours for the game)\nBefore playing this: don’t ready walkthroughs, don’t watch youtube for it, don’t go google...just play the game first and let it happen\nBest to be played alone and with good sound (A good headset or some serious speakers)\nDON’T play all episodes in one go. Play a episode and then wait a day or two before starting the next. Have your mind ponder about it a little and see what happens.\nAll in all I would say this game is a must play and in my opinion it should be game of the year.","October 21, 2015","true","20.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Thus i felt compelled to write my first review for a game to help others decide if it is worth buying. If you wanna skip the different points I considered you can find my verdict at the end.\n\n-Story (contains VERY mild spoilers)\nLife is Strange follows young Max Caulfield, a student of photography at Blackwell Academy in the fictional small town of Arcadia Bay, Oregon. Confronted with a life-threatening situation she finds out that she has the power to rewind time. This ability allows her to change the outcome of many situations but is accompanied by apocalyptic visions of destruction. Reunited with an old childhood friend, Max soon finds out that under the idyllic surface of Blackwell Academy and Arcadia Bay there are darker facets.\n\n-Gameplay\nIt is played in 3rd person perspective. Classic WASD for moving around, Shift for running, points of interaction (and there are plenty of them) are activated by left-clicking with the mouse and dragging towards the desired action. Pressing the right mouse button rewinds time, adding shift rewinds faster, Ctrl fast rewinds to the last point of decision.\n\n-Visuals\nLife is Strange was clearly inspired by the Telltale games like Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us or Game Of Thrones. The difference is that Life is Strange is truly a beauty to behold. The visuals are very atmospheric, the camera angles and the lightning are top notch. I dare say it reaches a quality regarding atmosphere that is seldom found in PC gaming (mind you-it does in no way try to be photorealistic and has its own art-style).\n\n-Audio\nVoice acting is generally on a high level and satisfying. I found one minor character with a sub-par performance, however his part was so small that it didnt affect the overall experience at all. What truly shines is the excellent indie soundtrack. There are plenty of atmospheric pieces, both instrumental and vocal. I still regulary listen to the soundtrack. Even if you dont buy the game try out the soundtrack on YT.\n\n-Pacing\nLife is Strange has a slow pace, it takes its time to develop its characters and invites the player to explore the surroundings thoroughly. This is both a strong and a weak side of the game. In its best moments it allows total immersion. However, in a very few situations it deprives the necessary feel of urgency. If you come to terms with that and accept that you are supposed to play it slowly and explore you will be fine.\n\n-Choices\nPlenty of choices to make. Not all of them really do mattter much, but there a enough that really do matter. The rewind button is a nice substitute for a quicksave button. In fact you dont need to save at all, the game does this for you.\n\n-Puzzles\nOf course there are occasional puzzles to solve. Most of them are solved by observation, one or two outstayed their welcome as they stalled the progression of the story.\n\n-Characters\nIn my opinion the strongest side of the game. The lead characters transport that awkward feeling of being a teenager in a plausibel manner and one quickly develops a bond. I cant remember when I last felt that attached to the main characters of a pc game. The supporting characters may at first glance look like stereotypes (the bad guy, the geek etc.) but that changes during the course of the 5 episodes. Every character shows facets that you wouldnt have expected. The stereotypical acting of some supports especially in episode 1 is almost a necessity to get acquainted with the quite numerous people that live on campus and in town. It changes in the later episodes.\n\n-Writing\nBest story I played/read in years. It is really that good. Takes its time to develop but then it hits you in the guts. What begins seemingly as a classical highschool story develops into a coming of age drama that explores the dark side of humanity, the boundaries of friendship, and asks the question how far one would go to save the people one loves.\n\n-Verdict\nLife is Strange is not a game for everyone. It takes time to develop, forces the player to take his time and explore his surroundings thoroughly if he wants to achieve the immersion necessary to truly digest this game. If you manage to get absorbed without distractions from outside and are willing to emotionally invest you will certainly have a great experience. Life is Strange is a coming-of-age drama with mystery elements that draws inspiration from movies like Donnie Darko, Butterfly Effect and Juno or David Lynchs masterpiece Twin Peaks. Catcher in the Rye bei J.D. Salinger is also among the inspirations, both protagonists even share the last name. If you know and like these you will like Life is Strange. The writing is superb, the soundtrack is fantastic and the artstyle is beautiful. It explores dark themes that some people may find disturbing but it does so in a tasteful way, never for sensationalism. I truly can recommend this game. It just worked for me and the emotional impact of certain choices and outcomes really hit hard. Probably my personal candidate for game of the year 2015.","December 28, 2015","true","26.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The story is well and truly captivating and the harsh reality many of the students within the game face can be seen as sad and heartbreaking, rude and jock-ish, or funny and heartwarming.\n\nWhilst I am waiting for episode 4 to come out, Episodes 1, 2, and 3 have all had their own shares of gut wrenching, nail biting moments. The characters are all seperate, no two of them alike, and whilst a few do follow the cliche of your typical school-like group of cliques, and yet they all work well in tandem with eachother.\n\nThe game mechanics are very nice, the plot is interesting and daunting, and I'm personally happy to say that the game runs extremely smoothly on my PC even on higher settings and ever during more detailed scenes where you would expect framerate drops. The plot-based mechanic of controlling time is also very interesting, a think I've never seen done so well in a game.\n\nThe story itself runs very linearly with sides of stories and events branching off. Whilst you will end up in similar situations, the decisions aren't deceptive in that they don't effect the game. In fact, a choice you decide to make at the very start of Episode 1 haunts your words and choices by the end of Episode 3, and decisions from Episode 1 and 2 could either make or break some key moments in Episode 3, and I've never felt so ashamed of myself for having "messed up" my decision making, and the decisions aren't easy to make either.\n\nIf you're looking for a Young Adults game revolving the mystery of time control, with an interesting plot, great game mechanics, nice and not too overly complex graphics and modelling, I would definitely recommend this game to you, and I personally would say that the awards the developer's have had so far have been well deserved.\n\nI'm on my way to play Episode 4, and can't wait for Episode 5!","July 28, 2015","true","20.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Sure, the characters suck you in, and you fall in love with Arcadia bay, but it's much bigger than that.\n\nLife is Strange struck an emotional chord at a very deep, personal level for me. Every decision I made not only affected characters that I was invested in, but I subconciously projected these decisions onto experiences of my own past.  While these game-to-life experiences  were not anywhere close to being literally similar, they each shared an emotional theme. My journey through LiS left me in a stunned contemplation, one that I am still in days after finishing the story.\n\nI learned some life lessons from this game, and wish I could formally thank DONTNOD for a few of the realizations it helped surface.

That feelings, this music, those moments.. you cant even describe it's sooo emotional, so real.\n\nLife is Strange indeed. I think some of the players who actually played this game changed their life immediately.\n\n☛ GJ Dontnod Entertainment!\n\nLike they are fighting now for their friends, stop bullying. Because the outcome of bullying could be the worst thing EVER what can happen 2 yourselves, feelings of guilt and karma. There are many bad people in the world, but remember there is always someone who loves and cares about you.\n\n☛ We probably all have seen in Life Is Strange, right?\n\nAnd this game clearly shows, it's not easy to trust ppl. It's really not.\nJust play it and u will see what I mean ;) prediction is pretty hard in this game and u will get suprised alot, in a positive or negative way? Who knows, who knows!\n\n☛ You can maybe learn something for your life. Think about the "small" things, they are priceless.\n\n---------------------Life Is Strange <3--------------------------------\n\nI just looooove this game and recommend it for sure. I could cry everyday if I would listen to these Soundtracks. :(\nDefinitely my favorite game by now. <3\nI really hope for season 2! I'm pretty sure those guys are talented enough 2 do that!

If you had the power to change things. Would you? And would the consequence of those actions be for the good? The bad? Or the just downright chaotic?..\n\nThis game feels so much like a detective, thriller, drama, sci-fi and love story all rolled into one by all those famous novelists and you are right inside that novel, living it, breathing it.\n\nYou will laugh; you will cry; you will enjoy; you will hate; and then, you will go back and do it all again..\n\nThe graphics work so well with the game, but the soundtrack is absolutely amazing and worked so beautifully with each story (You just have to watch the trailers to see/hear what I mean).\n\nI would say, if you are a conscientious person who has feelings and cares about your actions and others, you will love this game; If you are a person without conscience and doesn't give a rat's a** about others, then you probably aren't going to like it.\nIf you're not sure - purchase episode 1, and, if like me, you'll be hooked and buy the rest..\n\nKudo's to DONTNOD and Square Enix..

The game is so amazing and beautiful in every way you can imagine. I have never seen a better written story in my life, and this comes from someone who practically grew up on a theatre. The characters in the game feel so real that a lot of people, me included, are having separation anxiety now that the game is over.\n\nNot only is the story outstanding, but the game also features absolutely gorgeous sceneries that perfectly fits in to the moment. You just know that you have found yourself a beautiful game when you could take a screenshot at any moment and it would make for the perfect wallpaper. I have taken over 200 screenshots so far, and there are many photo oppertunities I have missed. Remember: always take the shot!\n\nPro tip: Don't just watch the game on youtube, buy the game and play it for yourself. Altough some people may feel like there isn't really a big differense, it really is. You will get so much more from the game by actually having the controlls in your own hands.\n\nWarning: This game can make anyone very emotional.

Манипуляции эти одними отматываниями фейлов не ограничиваются, а предлагают нам порядочное количество интересных и свежих сцен, в которых мы, например выуживаем определенную информацию, а потом отматываем время назад и юзаем ее на ни о чем не подозревающей жертве. Или играемся с концептом причина-->следствие (например методом проб и ошибок избегаем потасовки). Или еще какой интересной фиговиной занимаемся.\n\nТакже у этих ребят вторую игру подряд все очень хорошо с окружением и вниманием к деталям. Тут они вообще заманьячились и создали такое себе livable space с кучей приятных деталей, каждую из которых героиня еще как нибудь прокомментирует.\n\nПонравилась главгероиня и большое количество всяких разных второстепенных персонажей. Некоторые прям вообще милахи (например бедняга Кейт Марш), некоторые просто живые, к которым проникаешься какой-никакой симпатией со временем (например отчим Хлои).\n\nПорой игра может порядочно так дать right in the feels (особенно мне этим конец второго эпизода и первая половина четвертого запомнились). Порой - порадовать годными твистами. В конце авторы не удержались и накрутили годной психоделики (не зря у героини имя Макс, лол).\n\nТеперь о плохом и очень плохом.\n\nВо первых, в игре безобразная лицевая анимация, много хуже даже теллтейловской (!!). Порой очень мешает, особенно в драматические моменты. Непонятно почему разрабы сэкономили на этом, учитывая что в целом мокап очень качественный (много лучше теллтейловских одинаковых анимаций).\n\nВо вторых, игра порой не может определится - она кинематографичный сериал или кондовый пойнтэндклик. И поэтому происходит странное - вот у нас вовсю кипела жизнь и действо, а вот мы шаримся полчаса по помойке и ищем пять чертовых бутылок под одинаковые повторяющиеся реплики ГГ. Когда Макс раз в пятнадцатый мне сказала "тут рядом где-то кострище ололо" - хотелось долго и продолжительно ругаться матом. Makes wonders to pacing.\n\nНу и третья (и главная) синеволосая проблема носит имя Хлоя и является вторым (если не первым) по значимости персонажем в игре. Героиня вышла какой-то откровенно противной, с главгероиней никакой интересной химии у ней нет. Я понимаю что они хотели циничную бунтарку, тут ничего плохого нет, но получилась какая то гнилая, вечно ноющая гилттрипящая горе-манипулятроша, что как то даже не по себе. Не помогает и тот факт, что почти все стопорящие темп игры вышеописанные ситуации происходят по ее прямой наводке (в то время как она прохлаждается где-то неподалеку).\n\nНу и концовка не разозлит, а ОЧЕНЬ разозлит всех тех, кто очень любит жаловаться про иллюзию выбора в тредах по каждой игре теллтейл. Такого среднего пальца любителям увидеть результаты своих выборов в финале я не видел, пожалуй, со времен массэффект три. Но, впрочем, мне на это всегда было довольно до лампочки, так что не суть.","November 4, 2015","true","17.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

Even better than Monkey Island, Half-Life, Bioshock, Mass Effect and The Talos Principle, just to name a few.\n\n100/100 thouroughly deserved.\nStill here? Scroll up and buy it but wait for Episode 5 to come out before you start playing.\n\n\nA real masterpiece, the perfect example of a modern, episodic emotional adventure game.\nThis is going to be a very looong review but I'll try to do my best not to bore you, but to help you understand why I think this is the greatest game I have ever played. I have been playing since I was two years old, and not once I encountered a game who could make me emphasize so much with its characters that I actually ended up laughing and crying together with them.\n\nBut, first things first, the technical aspects:\n\nGameplay - Apparently simple, it involves one of the most efficient and "believable" time-travel mechanics you will find in a videogame. One click and Max will rewind time to make different choices that actually matter with VERY different consequences and outcomes.\nGraphics - Astonishing hand-drawn visuals that make you appreciate the world of LIS and its characters. It's like living in a painting by Monet or Renoir. The lighting effects are superb and the character animation is top-notch; I believe it is way better than TellTale's. All of the people in Arcadia Bay look alive, absolutely natural and incredibly real. Chloe and Max above all. The one and only (but extremely little) downside is the lip synch, which in the earlier episodes is not good at all. But the guys at Dontnod have already explained they had a budget to keep in mind and they focused on other aspects of the game. Plus, in the third and, especially, fourth Episode, it GREATLY improves. Kudos to them!\nSoundtrack - A marvelous selection of songs which makes you forget about playing and makes you want to freeze those little, precious moments of time, just to stand back, listen to the soundtrack and admire the world of Arcadia Bay as it unfolds before Max's eyes (and yours).\nVoice Acting - It's the most perfect, real and "immersive" voice acting I have ever experienced in a videogame. Every actor delivers their lines exceptionally and manages to make you actually *feel* the emotions and the feelings of their characters.\nCamera - The camera work is stunning and gives all dialogues and interactions a cinematic feel which makes you enter the story.\nNow, let's talk about what this fabulous game is. It looks like a TellTale game, a nice adventure with a few important choices and some other minor ones. We could compare it with The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, for instance. I love TT games, they are really great and I recommend them, too, but Life Is Strange is certainly better and much, much more immersive. It will make you laugh and cry, you will enjoy every little piece of dialogue, or thought, and the more you play, the more you will feel genuinely close to Max, Chloe and the others.\n\nThe storyline is amazing and very well written right from the start. It truly is an emotional roller coaster. It will make you think hard about lots of moral questions and it will make you doubt your own certainties.\n\nIt will change the way you look at life, for the better.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nI recommend this game to everyone, no matter the gaming experience, age, gender.\nEven a block of concrete would melt down while playing this hella awesome game.","September 26, 2015","true","64.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","2"

There’s a beauty in them I didn’t see before. LiS is a lovely game full of wonderful characters and, despite how emotionally exhausting it was for me, I will always remember it fondly.\n\n***\nThe first thing I said upon completing Life is Strange was, “@#^& this game. I will never ever replay it. I’m not even sure I’m happy I played it at all,” when just a few days prior I had been telling the same person how much I loved the game, and how nervous yet excited I was for the final episode….\n\n***\nLife is Strange is a journey. Episodes 1-4 will suck you in, and you’ll quickly fall in love with its setting and characters. The story will make you feel happy, sad, anxious, angry, and maybe a little bit sick sometimes. The problem is that, in the end, it feels like DONTNOD didn’t care about its own story and characters as much as you will.\n\n(potentially vague SPOILERS ahead)\n\nWhile I loved most of episode 5, it suffered from gameplay and writing issues not found in the previous episodes. It felt rushed, and a lot of the story and lore were thrown out the window. The way you come to whatever ending you get will (and has) upset a lot of people. However, I think there was a lesson DONTNOD was trying to teach us with it. Whether you appreciate this lesson or feel like it has no place in a video game is another story. I found a sort of solace in it--the sort of solace that can only be found by finally accepting reality for what it is instead of hiding from it.\n\nThat said, the endings themselves feel unbalanced and incomplete. One of them was obviously given a lot more thought and energy, but that’s not to say it’s better. It’s not. All the endings feel like a slap in the face, albeit for different reasons. You can justify them by saying “it’s about the journey”, and it is, but when you consider everything you had to go through to get there you wonder if the journey was even worth it.\n\n(end SPOILERS)\n\n***\nLife is Strange will emotionally break you, or at least drain you, over and over again, and I can’t honestly say if it was worth it for me. Perhaps there are too many things in the story that I can personally relate to, which is why it exhausted me, and why the ending(s), especially one of them, felt so cruel and punishing.\n\nYes, I’m still recommending it, but it’s with some hesitation. The end may or may not ruin it for you, but there is no denying it’s still a great game. I loved the setting. I loved the characters. I loved most of the story. But I stick with what I said when I first finished it: I will never ever replay it and I’m not sure I’m happy I did at all.\n\nThis might be the most ambivalent review on Steam, but a fictional story has never left me feeling more jaded or cynical about life, or made me care less about being a good person.","October 21, 2015","true","18.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

At the time I finished it, I wish I had never played it. I held no malice towards it, I simply wish it was not a thing that had happened to catch my eye. It hurt me. I fell in love with the characters especially, but everything about it, from the visuals to the soundtrack, was just amazing. And when it ended, I lost all of that, and it hurt. Both going back to my own disappointing life, and the memory of how my time in this one ended.\n\nIn this world, there's no turning back time. So much of Life Is Strage was about rewinding the past and changing what you didn't like for the better, but here you can only change the present. This experience was unique, even formative. After finishing this game, I wished I could go back to Arcadia Bay, and have things turn out differently. But I couldn't lie to myself like that. The scars were there to stay. I would have undone that hurt if I could, but I couldn't. And I made peace with that.\n\nThis game caused me (and my college best friend, who I tricked into playing it while I was still upset about how it ended) to question who we were, and has honestly been a big part of my recent efforts to turn my life around.\n\nLife is Strange.","April 1","true","14.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The graphics, assuming they're supposed too look like that, are very plesant too look at.\n\nThe voice work was very decent, I could only say that victoria, and juliet are the least realistic, but all of the other voice actors, including the extras in the game, are phenomenal.\n\nThis game focuses on the fact that your character can reverse time, which is pretty B.A. if you ask me, considering you can change your decision if you make the wrong choice in-game. which makes for real fun, considering you can hear new dialogue, also... when you can reverse time to search and figure out stuff if something goes wrong.\n\nCon's:\n\nNow this game is a puzzle game sort of... I had a problem with the paint, when I was supposed to tamper with it, I think I was the only dumbass that couldn't figure it out for 5 minutes. But it would've been nice for an indicator or something to point to the paint bucket before samuel had taken it.\n\n~That's about it xD\n\nI didn't experience any glitches or bugs when playing so I can't say for sure that it has any.\n\nI give this game 8.5/10 truly amazing, and a must buy for people that love Visual Novels. Such as The Walking Dead Game.  It's good looking, and has a plot that'll suck you into the game\n\nIf you liked this review, please give this a thumbs up.\n\nI give this game a few respect points for the references to "Akira" XD\n\n~ Mr.Nonexistent Reviews","February 1, 2015","true","6.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It’s pretty big step of retrying new things. It captures real-world interactive drama, teenage school life and impressive dialogues.\n\nEpisode 1: Chrysalis\nYou played as Max Caulfield who returns to attend in BlackWell Academy to progress on her photography career. As you progress through the story, she finds out something strange inside as she has ability to reverse time. This ability plays major role of the story. You can rewind any past event to resolve your mistake, solve the puzzles, and change how to story should progress. The game is about collect information and use to support major choice to find out most satisfied outcome for the player. It’s like Memory Remix of Remember Me, but focus on different consequence for future episode. The overall gameplay feels very relax, there’s no pressured timer like Telltale games.\n\nThe first episode leaves my impression with world setup and character development. The old paint-like graphics, drawing like UI, and beautiful music create relaxing experience and be a “part” of Max’s journey.\nSure, there are few mistakes like lip-sync issue for most characters and some awkward dialogue which I feel out of place.\nLife is Strange is amazing experience.

It’s pretty big step of retrying new things. It captures real-world interactive drama, teenage school life and impressive dialogues.\n\nEpisode 1: Chrysalis\nYou played as Max Caulfield who returns to attend in BlackWell Academy to progress on her photography career. As you progress through the story, she finds out something strange inside as she has ability to reverse time. This ability plays major role of the story. You can rewind any past event to resolve your mistake, solve the puzzles, and change how to story should progress. The game is about collect information and use to support major choice to find out most satisfied outcome for the player. It’s like Memory Remix of Remember Me, but focus on different consequence for future episode. The overall gameplay feels very relax, there’s no pressured timer like Telltale games.\n\nThe first episode leaves my impression with world setup and character development. The old paint-like graphics, drawing like UI, and beautiful music create relaxing experience and be a “part” of Max’s journey.\nSure, there are few mistakes like lip-sync issue for most characters and some awkward dialogue which I feel out of place.\nLife is Strange is amazing experience. You will enjoy with different choices, warm welcome and real world setup. This game is definitely worth to pick it and I’m looking forward for future episodes.","January 30, 2015","true","5.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

If you play with time, there will be consequences. Let the river flow or assume responsibility for your acts.\n\n✓ Great characters\nThere's a lot of connections and character development in this game. I love how it measures your maturity by making you take sides.\n\n✓ Lovely soundtrack\nI can't emphasize this enough. The soundtrack is so beautiful and fitting, it plays a huge role. LiS wouldn't be the same without it.\n\n✓ References all over the place\nI'm not talking about the pop culture references, I'm talking about the photography references! Every achievement in this game is a photography subject. As someone who has studied photography, most of the time they felt forced, but sometimes they were o n p o i n t.\n\n✓ Neat art style and post-processing\nGraphics-wise, LiS isn't anything impressive, but its art style, environment and lighting make it stand out and look unique. See: Borderlands.\n\n\n✗ Episode 1 doesn't make a good first impression\nI got the first episode as a birthday gift, and to be frank, I thought it was pretentious, overrated hipster garbage. So may this serve as a warning: if you want to play this game and understand why it's gotten so many positive reviews, don't form your opinions based on the first episode (which goes on sale pretty often and can be bought dirt cheap)... it's deceiving. The game gets a lot better as you progress.\n\nVerdictIf you like point & clicks, let me just say that I got more hours of enjoyment out of LiS than I've gotten from any Telltale game. That said, The Walking Dead games left an emotional scar on me, and Life is Strange didn't. It's a bit sad but not emotionally draining or anything... I mean, if we're gonna talk about feels and time travel, have you watched Steins;Gate or Madoka Magica? LiS is a walk in the park in comparison.\n\nBut despite all this, it's a great experience and it's good to see a game where nothing falls short.

After completing this game I can say that there honestly isn't much that could be better! This is bar far one of my favorite games ever!\n\nYou are an 18 year old, Max, who figured out she had the ability to turn back time. This was a surprising twist since this game is dripping with choices to make. This time the choices really impact the stories outcome. Strap in, high school has never been so dark, dangerous and cruel.\n\nIf you aren't sure about this game try grabbing episode 1 for cheap and give it a go. If you completely finish the first episode you will definitely want to pick up the other offerings because the story just keeps getting better and better.\n\nThere is nothing that will turn out exactly how you think; this story is carefully woven like a spider’s web. The path will unfold based on your choices. Will you rewind time or hold firm with your decisions and face the consequences.?\n\nWorth $50 -You can pick up all (5) for $10-20!\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

And the reason is, that I think Life is Strange is one of the few games nowdays that worth their price. I have never been so satisfied with 3 hours spent in front of my computer, playing the first episode. This simple story about a girl, with typical girl-ish problems, like boys, school, relationship, and choices, mixed with her supernatural time-rewinding power totally got me. It makes me think about my own life too, what would I do with a power like this, or more importantly, how should I live my own life in a way that I don't even have to use it. This is obviously not the best choice-consequence game I've ever played, but I have to admit, that this game is exeptional, and totally worth buying, and playing through. I honestly recommend it to everyone, because it's so addictive, and deep. The only downside most people mention is the bad lip-syncing, but seriously, who cares about it, if you are playing a game? Personally, I didn't even notice it until someone mentioned it in a discussion. The comic-like graphics aslo splits the community, but I just don't care :D I love every second of the game, and this was the only single-player-only product on Steam that I felt worth buying. Of course, this is only my personal opinion.","June 18, 2015","true","17.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","7","10","3","1"

Also the disappearance of a popular girl at school and chaotic visions about a storm near the town make you wonder what is really going on.\n\nThe game is based on time travelling and making choices that lead to certain consequences (like the walking dead game, the wolf among us etc).

That's all I can say. I have split this review up and update as I play the episodes. All episode reviews are brief and have no spoilers. I'd like to address the reviews saying bad things because of lip-sync issues. Although this is not a lie, it does not affect any story if you're listening to their voices not watching their lips. This can also be expected as the developer is French, so they do not natively speak English.\n\nEpisode 1: Chrysalis\nA great episode that introduces you to the mechanics and characters, giving you choices that do not really change the story in many ways. This eases you smoothly into the game I'm sure you will love and will be a favourite of your library.\n\nOverall a 8 out of 10 as of Episode 1: Chrysalis\n\nEpisode 2: Out if Time\nIt starts to throw you into the rough water, forcing you to make harder choices, and the characters always make you feel guilty after you choose dramatic decisions. The ending is truly a challenge, and will require you to pick up tiny details of plot to decide which ending you receive.\n\nOverall a 9 out of 10 as of Episode 2: Out Of Time\n\nEpisode 3: Chaos Theory\nMy god... this game steps up the difficulty, stuffing harder choices into your already full arms, with a shocking plot detail at the end that will give you chills to the bone. It is a truly sad ending, and I can't wait to see what happens next. Gameplay still amazing.\n\nOverall a 10 out of 10 as of Episode 3: Chaos Theory\n\nEpisode 4: Dark Room\nMore of a cinematic episode, this episode has a huge plot twist at the end. A definite high point in the series. It gets you wondering how there could be another episode, then bam. A strike to the brain. Not as moving as some events in Episode 3, but still sad.\n\nOverall a 10 out of 10 as of Episode 4: Dark Room\n\nEpisode 5: Polarized\nOne of the most shocking and moving finales to a series, TV or games, as long as you choose the right ending. One ending is, in my opinion, disappointing. However, there are plenty of tear jerking moments between all different characters, with some Bioshock-Infinite-style segment. Events in this game are more dark than previous episodes. More emotions are added to the mix, like love, anger and confusion.

The key example of this is that you can actually prevent characters from dying (not naming any names to avoid spoilers for newcomers), which is great as I find you actually have time to learn about and get attatched to all of the characters you meet (both minor and major). The storytelling of the game coupled with the great voice acting creates a world that you can immerse yourself and spend hours upon hours in without even noticing, and the constant plot twists keep you on your toes. I could go on, but I'll save everyone some time by wrapping up my review here:\nIf you're a fan of episodic games, Life is Strange is a must have.","August 1, 2015","true","23.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaboobs/recommended/319630/","kaboobs","sneize the moment","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaboobs/","54 products in account","I've had a hard time deciding whether to recommend this game or not, because it's overrated (storywise) but at the same time was very enjoyable up to episode 4.\n\nI found the ending choices VERY predictable. It's actually the first thing that came to mind once it was revealed that Max can travel through time. It's the epitome of time travel cliches. Basically the moral of the story is (spoiler alert, maybe): Don't mess with time even though you have this mysterious power that we can't explain. -_-\n\nWith that said, I like Max, and I like her power. It's unique. She can only travel to certain moments caught in pictures and can only rewind a few seconds back in time to reverse immediate actions. It made the game experience very enjoyable and refreshing.\n\nI found it extremely disappointing that my choices had absolutely no impact on the endings. Especially the ones involving Alyssa. I save her every single time and the 'butterfly' icon shows up telling me this will have an impact on later events. Where the hell exactly? That never happens. I just keep saving her over and over. What a useless character. Choices involving other character impact other events through episodes 1-4, but episode 5 just gives you the middle finger because none of that matters when the ending is only affected by the very last choice you make, and nothing else.\n\nSpoiler alert: The 'good' ending involves you (Max) undoing all the changes you have ever created by not doing the very first 'superhero' action you have done, saving Chloe. Thus erasing all the events that took place later on including everything you've done in the first 4 episodes. Yep, nothing mattered eventually. The 'bad' ending is the same except instead of saving the world you save your punkrock sidekick and drive into the sunset (and possibly kiss if you've picked the right choices >_>) while everyone you've seen in the story is dead.\n\nEpisode 5 was the worst. It wasn't particularly bad in and of itself but since it included the ending(s), I didn't enjoy it. However I enjoyed the game thoroughly up to episode 4 (excluding a few times where I got stuck in stupid tedious uncalled for missions like the bottle collection - It might've been an excuse to force us to explore the area, but I naturally do that anyway). I can't bring myself to give this game a negative rating because I truly enjoyed the first 4 episodes. In those, you can clearly see how much your choices impact later events. Episode 5 threw all of that in the garbage with that ending.\n\nWhen it comes to game design, I have to say I like the controls in this game. Using your mouse to drag to the 'look' or 'use' functions wasn't something I got the hang of quickly, but it's innovative and fits the theme of the game. Keep in mind that this is my very first storybased game. I never played games like The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones and Telltale games, so I can't compare it to them.\n\nTL;DR:\nIf you're expecting some mindblowing Sci Fi themed story from this game, look elsewhere, only disappointment ahead. Otherwise, play it, for whatever other reason. It's enjoyable even if it was slightly disappointing story-wise. I'm giving it a thumbs down because it doesn't deserve all the credit it's been given especially for that half-♥♥♥♥♥ ending.\n\n/This is the longest review I've ever written, and I have no sense of structure whatsoever, just jumbled thoughts, sorry.","January 6","false","16.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

There is a lot to look at within the world and a lot of it won't progress the game, but there for the purpose of increasing the world immersion.  At times, checking all the items can feel a bit frustrating as most of the game is fairly slow-paced.  Some of the cut scenes I'd recommend to treat as if you are watching a movie, grab some popcorn or snacks and relax.  Make sure you're in the mood to swap between the tasks of watching and playing.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=467114369\n\nHaving said this, this is the only critism I can make, but it is one that lessened my immersion within the game at certain points.  Certainly not ruined it though.\n\nThe strong points I previously mentioned hold together a fine piece of art that occasionaly plods along, but mostly has me believing this twin-peaks type game-world really exists!\n\nThe last part of episode three was really fantastic, and now I get to wait like 3 weeks or so for the next episode.  I can't really wait.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed and rated The Walking Dead S1.  I think Life is Strange could be on a par with TWD S1.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/edwyn/recommended/319630/","edwyn","Omahdon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/edwyn/","1170 products in account","Life is Strange has the shape of the game I want to play - but whether or not it ends up being the magnificent sculpture that I hope it is, is dependant upon the next four episodes yet to be released. Still, it's a strong start for Dontnod Entertainment's sophomore effort and I am cautiously, optimistically charmed by this rendering of a small Oregon seaside town. It's pretty much all plot setup for the first episode of the game: meeting all the characters, taking a walkabout the setting and getting absorbed into a world.\n\nThat said, some of the writing is a little bit awkward. A lot of a bit awkward, really. Most of it is intentional (I think) since it's a story primarily about teenagers transitioning into adulthood and all the wonderful awkwardness that period of life entails. The story keeps a whole lot of balls in the air: high school drama and the unspoken social hierarchies, rich high school kids with too much money and not enough sense, loners and "the alternate crowd" who are not nearly as rebellious as they think they are, and all of them with private lives they keep hidden to project these "proper" images of themselves. Some (a lot) of it is perhaps a little bit straightforward (the rich ♥♥♥♥♥ turns out to be a lonely girl, the jerkass jock is a bundle of psychological issues) but it's nice to see a game that lets you explore these tiny minutiae of everyday life at a slower, more thoughtful pace.\n\nAnd then there's the other kind of awkwardness - one which comes from something being originally written in another language and then translated into English correctly on a TECHNICAL level, but perhaps not so much on... the spiritual level? Some of the slang is a bit on the hella off. And if you just winced at my wonky use of the word "hella" in that previous sentence, then you're going to be in for a MARVELLOUS time. That word gets used in ways that were probably never used before until this very game. And I'm willing to forget the one unironic use of the phrase "awesome sauce" if you are. Brrrr. I feel like the script could have used a couple more passes to smooth out some of the rougher spots but it's great for the most part and functional when it's not so great (if, yanno, awkward).\n\nThe voice acting deserves a lot of praise, as well. Hannah Telle carries the majority of the game as Max, the main character, and her performance conveys a perfect blend of introverted, gangly klutziness and self-aware hipster youth. Meanwhile, Ashly Burch's rebellious teen Chloe is a real revelation - I really only know her work as Tiny Tina from Borderlands 2 and Hey Ash Whatcha Playin', so to hear her playing this more down-to-earth lower key character is all kinds of amazing. But she still couldn't make that "awesome sauce" line work. Sorry.\n\nI also love the time travelling mechanic used in this game. Basically, at any point you can hold down a button, go back a couple of seconds and redo any major (or minor) decisions you may have made in that time. It's the perfect metaphor for OCD people like me who save and reload games in order to get the "perfect result" from a conversation with a character (tis part of the neverending quest of Dragon Age: Inquisition to get 100% approval with every character). The best part is that Max retains the knowledge of whatever major snafu you rewound back from, which adds a wonderful bit of leaning on the fourth wall: acknowledging the branching nature of the game's narrative design in the game's story itself. This is something I've only really seen in games like 999 and Virtue's Last Reward and wish the concept were explored more in games. It's the kind of narrative device that can only be told in an interactive medium like games, I feel.\n\nVisually, the game's environments have a kind of quiet beauty that leans more towards an impressionistic rendering of high school life. A lot of the environmental details are vague outlines or splashes of colour, with the more important details fleshed and fully drawn in. It's a nicely artistic touch that gently steers the eyes (and players) towards more significant landmarks like other characters and interactable items. That said, some of the character models look a little bit out of place in this mellow setting and the lip synch for dialogue in this game is possibly the worst I've seen in recent memory. Considering how much careful attention to detail was placed in putting together, say, a rebellious teen's bedroom filled with nostalgic memories of the past - the lip synch issue is kind of a strange misstep.\n\nAnd the music is so hipster. It is soooooooo hipster. I love it. But it is so, so, SO hipster. Acoustic guitars, soft male vocals crooning about soft summers and waterfalls. God, I want to punch myself in the face. But I love it. It's just... the PERFECT match for this game and the mood it's going for and oh no my fist is in my face how did that happen\n\nTL;DR I liked Life is Strange episode 1.

Is it a game?  Is it a movie?  Is it a modern day choose-your-own-adventure?  Is it simply art on showcase?\n\nThese are the questions that I asked myself after completing Episode 1.  After a few minutes of fiddling with the controls I quickly became accustomed to the physics.  Movement is well designed and fluid.  The controls are very natural and intuitive.\n\nThe visuals are semi-realistic with a monet-esque blur that truly transmits the aura of a dream-state.  Clearly a great deal of attention was put into the visual presentation of the story and the theme was consistent from one stage of the story to the next.  The sounds of the game from the hallway murmur to the chirping of birds outdoors was well-timed, realistic, and engaging.  The music throughout was excellent.  It fluidly merged with the visual presenation forming a cohesive whole that drove the plot.\n\nI am very impressed with the overall presenation.\n\nI really enjoyed the story as it unfolded and look forward to the remainnig 4 episodes which I will certainly buy for myself and for my sister.  I'm glad that I finally checked out this amazing title.  Even though the total entertainment time was short I'm more than happy with the price range.\n\nPerhaps the only drawbacks to my experience was choice limitation and a somewhat rushed plot develpoment.  It felt, to me, as if there were only two choices per event.  I would have liked to have seen more.  I also would have liked to have seen the plot develop a tad more slowly.\n\nAnyway, I hope the early choices made form a "family tree-like" divergence in final outcomes.  Since I have only com pleted episode 1 I shall have to wait and see.  I'm not going to replay any of the episodes until I have completed the entire story from start to finish but I do look forward to finding out how the different decisions impact the ultimate conculsion.\n\nAfter the credits ran I was thanked for playing by the development team--that was a nice touch.  They showed me  appreciation and I will return the favor.\n\nWell done.\n\nThank you for making this game.\n\n\n","July 13, 2015","true","21.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

She discovers that when she saves her best friend Chloe, who she hasn't seen for a few years. They both are doing research to find a fellow student (and good friend of Chloe), that has been mysteriously disappeared. They more the discover, the more in danger they become.\n\nIn this game you have to make desicions, and that may have some consequences in the future. If you rewind time and do things differently in the past, then it will alter the present and future. And that may be quite drastic. This game has five episodes, and I really liked the storyline and characters. I also thought the music they used were very suiting, and matched perfectly for the right atmosphere and mood. If they would sell a Life is Strange soundtrack I would buy it ^^\n\nAnyway, I would recommend this game.

It's the first game, at least that I have played, that gets the interactive game-but-really-a-movie right. A big part of this is the rewind mechanic. It fits in perfectly with the surreal, kind of magic realism feel it's going for, but it also allows you to explore any and all choices you make without any (immediate) consequences. That's always been a big turn-off in Telltale Games: sometimes the protagonist will word things differently than you expected and you'd wish you could make a different choice. Well here you can, and it actually makes sense from the story's perspective.\n\nThe game feels like the interactive love child of Juno and Veronica Mars, with hints of The Butterfly Effect. The visual style really works for this kind of story and the audio is spot-on. Max is really fleshed out as a character and is not just a carta blanca waiting to be filled in by your imagination, which is great.\n\nPlay this game, and watch your sympathy for hipsters grow. I expect the full game to last about 15 (well filled) hours for a single, slow-pace playthrough, so take from that what you will.\n\nPost-finale addendum\n\nIt's great. The final few episodes are one heck of a rollercoaster. All in all I can tell you that the story isn't particularly innovative, the graphics aren't the greatest, and sometimes the dialogue gets a bit too Dawson's Creek for my taste.\n\nBut beyond that the voice acting is amazing and the music is incredibly atmospheric. The characters are very believable and relatable and even though the story may not be innovative, it's done very well.

Após alguns acontecimentos incluindo a aparição de uma borboleta azul Max se vê em um pesadelo quando assisti a sua melhor amiga de infância Chloe Price ser assassinada na sua frente, nesse momento o desespero de Max é tão grande que sem querer ela acaba ganhando um poder misterioso de voltar no tempo, e acaba mudando todo o ocorrido, mas como o tio Ben fala "com grandes poderes vem grandes responsabilidades"  é missão de Max  ajudar sua amiga Chloe a desvendar os mistérios, e impedir uma catástrofe  que esta por vim. Life is Strange tem um enredo lindo e muito bem elaborado acompanhado de uma trilha sonora  impecável, e que conta com uma jogabilidade simples e divertida, que consiste em investigação e escolhas que podem alterar  o seu futuro, lembrando que pode voltar no tempo após ter feito alguma escolha que não nos agradou, o jogo também nos da a possibilidade de usar as informações de uma conversa já terminada para mudarmos o rumo da própria ou até mesmo de outra que venha a acontecer, além de que o retrocesso é essencial para prosseguir em algumas partes do game.\nAgrada principalmente aos apreciadores de grandes enredos com volta no tempo, é notável que o game teve grande influência de filmes como "efeito borboleta", e aqueles que têm paciência para explorar cenários e conversar com npc’s ( non-playable caracteres / personagens não jogáveis ) Life is Strange se encaixa perfeitamente com seus hábitos. Além disso, o que também auxilia muito a entender melhor todos os fatos que ocorrem durante o game é se atentar a leitura do diário de Max e de suas SMS’s (disponíveis quando se pausa o jogo). Mais do que mais uma obra de viagem no tempo e as consequências que isso pode gerar nas vidas (e no ambiente) dos personagens,  Life is Strange é sobre tomar decisões, sejam elas simples ou complexas. Jogo simplesmente incrível !","July 27, 2015","true","60.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The entire first episode I was laughing at how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cringe-worthy the dialogue was. It definitely improved in the second episode, but it wasn't until the third episode where it seemed like the characters actually began speaking and interacting like human beings. That's also the point where I got absolutely hooked.\n\nThe story was definitely better than I expected, and the further in you go the better it gets. Pair that with the overall solid performances, and it's pretty entertaining. Unlike similar games by other companies, choices actually matter beyond changing some dialogue. Also unlike similar games, this game actually has a game - with puzzles and ♥♥♥♥ rather than just picking dialogue and performing quick time events. The rewind feature is also cool, though at times felt tedious and tiresome. It also gets points for being absolutely gorgeous, using a (mostly) unique art style that looks great at almost all times.\n\nThe episodes are long, entertaining, and well-crafted (aside from dialogue in early episodes, as mentioned) - definitely worth their individual or bundled price tags. PLUS, IT HAS A DEMO. You don't have an excuse to not even try it out. Play the demo, and if you like it snag up the first episode.

If you're a big fan of Telltale games, Life is Strange is definitely worth checking out. As much as I love Telltale, this game allows the choices we make to actually have an impact on story, which a few of the Telltale games do fall short on. Whether there is alternative endings for the choices we make is still unclear. (I have a feeling there will be but who knows. I do hope there are alternative endings)\n\nThe game feels so cinematic. From the soundtrack, to the way they create each cutscene in the story (the shots/cinematography really make it feel like you're watching a film). The vibe from the game is essentially a highschool indie film. Yes, the characters revolve around teenagers and a bit of highschool drama, but being an adult myself, I don't feel like it takes the appeal away.\n\nEDIT:  I 110% stand by what I say above, and I have to add that the latest episode is amazing. The way the game has allowed us to become a part of the story with the discovery of mysteries is brilliant and we really do feel emotionally involved when everything connects in the end.

I can say that this is my personal pick for Game of the Year 2015. I avoided every YouTube videos to prevent spoilers, so I walked in absolutely not knowing what to expect. This will be a short and unorganized review (because I suck at writing reviews) and I'll try to keep it spoiler free.\n\nFirst things first, I gotta get it outta the way. I absolutely love the artistic style of this game. As a person who loves art and knows a little bit about photography it's great to see the amazing shots during the cutscenes and the game's use of depth of field. Every photo that you look at are beautifully hand painted. The game overall is just gorgeous to look at.\n\nThe beginning of Episode 1 started off pretty slow, but that's to be pretty much expected, so that wasn't a big deal. I was being introduced to a majority of the main characters. A couple of minutes in and I already like the main character. First thing that I do notice and like is how well the game puts the player in this school atmosphere. I felt like I was a part of the class.\n\nEpisode 2: Probably my favorite episode and most hated episode overall, probably due to it being mostly about my favorite character in the game. I have never felt so nervous and tense in a while from a video game. But I'm happy with the result that I received. So, why do I also hate this episode? ♥♥♥♥ the bottle sequence! That part was tedious, stupid and it took me forever to find all of them.\n\nEpisode 3: I WAS EATING THOSE BEANS! But seriously, don't mess with Frank and his beans. I was pretty mixed on this episode. But of course, the ending got me again. Man... ♥♥♥♥ rewind powers.\n\nEpisode 4: I ♥♥♥♥ing knew it! God, I never been so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at a character before in my life. I legit wanted to strangle the ♥♥♥♥ outta the jackass dude when I found those pictures of my favorite character. But aside from my anger at the series of events... Great episode! The beginning made me shed a tear.\n\nEpisode 5: ♥♥♥♥... (Sorry, not much can be said, you just have to play for yourselves)\n\nMy overall feelings towards the game. I absolutely loved it! Normally I don't like time traveling because that topic is always complicated as ♥♥♥♥, but I felt like the rewind mechanic was great. You telling me I get to talk ♥♥♥♥, spill your food and beer, rewind and pretend I didn't do any of that? Awesome, sign me up! But it's also interesting that I can always take back the previous choice that I've made. That alone made me really overthink my decisions. "Do I want this? But maybe this would be better in the future..." I literally spent 10 minutes thinking to myself over the final choice. Also, another thing I loved is the fact that the game DOESN'T ♥♥♥♥ING RUSH ME TO MAKE A CHOICE. ♥♥♥♥ off Telltale, how can I make an important decision that matters in less than 5 second?\n\nNow, I've played the Telltale games, I loved The Walking Dead (season 1) and The Wolf Amoung Us. But I absolutely hate The Game of Thrones. TWD season 2 while was decent, it got stale... Real stale. I didn't play Tales from the Borderlands, so I can't judge that game. But to me, Telltale games feels like they're becoming the Call of Duty of this interactive storytelling genre. They don't change a single thing to keep me engaged to the game. They also like to lie to you about saying how your choices matter. When was the last time any of your choices actually mattered?\nAt least in Life is Strange, while some decisions are pretty minor, most actually do have an affect towards how certain characters react and respond to you.\n\nAs for the ending of Life is Strange. I cried like a little baby, no lie. This was the hardest decision for me to make. While it was a predictable ending, I saw it coming. I still wasn't prepared for it. Something I don't understand is why people complain about the ending. I personally thought that it was well made. Sometimes in life, there are things that aren't meant to be changed. No matter how much you try. No matter how much you take things back... You simply cannot escape destiny. I feel like that's what the game's message is.\n\nOkay so since I tried my best to prevent spoilers. Would I recommend this? "Hella yeah!" Get this ♥♥♥♥ing game now, play it! Make friends, make enemies. Play as the best fictional hipster girl ever made. Make stupid life decisions. Go ape! Ape ape ape!\n\n\nMASSIVE SPOILERS here regarding the ending that I chose, I just have to let this out because it hurts.\n\nChloe, there was only so many times I could save you from death.\nI can't keep rewinding time or even create a different reality only to cause another natural disaster for this town and the next.\nNow, I loved and cared this girl to no end, she really was like a real best friend. She was extremely impulsive, ♥♥♥♥♥y, a real trouble maker, I could go on. But she showed me nothing but her loyalty and love. All of these things are what made her who she was. I would never change anything about her.\nAll of the laughs we shared, the fights we had, it pains me to know that you won't remember any of it.\nYou were never alone in this world, Chloe. I was and will always be there for you.\nWell, it's time to say my goodbyes. Rachel's waiting for you, Chloe. I'll see you later.\nRest In Peace...","November 25, 2015","true","33.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I see where they were going with an openish end with direction so the story kind of still goes on even though it ends. However the end is only decided by your last choice which is slightly betraying. In this game you will sit there and think which choice you should take, and that's where it feels like a betrayal.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/renegadekillerbee/recommended/319630/","renegadekillerbee","Renegade Killer Bee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/renegadekillerbee/","105 products in account","Sigh. What to say about a game that decided to throw all of its potential into the trash with the very last episode?\n\nSmart, I guess, since the game had everybody hooked with the first four episodes. But like the great Freddie Mercury sang: “It started off so well”…\n\nFirst, the good.\n\nLife is Strange is a game that depends on the relationships between characters, and the attachment that grows between player and characters. What made Life is Strange powerful for me was the coming-of-age story that it is – for teenage characters to come to terms with, and confront, difficult concepts like grief, loss and ultimately, acceptance, was great to see and executed with a bittersweet, very human touch. Chloe is a beautiful example of this – she starts out as an angry, defiant hellraiser, even with her estranged best friend, but develops into a mature, appreciative woman in a matter of days through the difficult events that are testing the residents of Arcadia Bay.\n\nThere’s a lot to explore in the quaint little coastal town of Arcadia Bay and its high school, Blackwell Academy. Through exploration, you discover more about the backstories and problems of minor characters – even if they have given you reason enough to dislike them in the main narrative. It’s easy to pass up or miss some of these opportunities, but it wouldn’t make the game quite so good if you did. DONTNOD have created a sufficiently immersive world in that regard, because it feels like something’s always simmering in the background in Arcadia Bay. Max’s adventures are not all there is to the world; some of her schoolmates are wrestling with their own demons too.\n\nOf course, the rewinding of time is a neat little mechanic too. What makes Max’s powers poignant to me is how they mainly exist to help her grow and mature as a character. What starts out as a convenient power to have then teaches her the danger involved in defying ‘fate’ and the difficulties involved in trying to shape events that should be beyond anybody’s control. The ability to use your rewind powers in tiny situations – such as when you’ve upset an acquaintance – is a nice human touch, because who hasn’t wished they could take things back? Who hasn’t ever hoped for a chance at a do-over? Even one of the core mechanics to the game is intended to appeal emotionally to the player.\n\nThen, the not-so-great.\n\nAt times, the twists are unnecessary and feel as if they exist purely to shock – but that I could handle, because they do still serve a purpose in the story, and in this game, the objective really seems to be the growth and development of all characters involved. Still, the dialogue and the events could’ve used a more subtle, nuanced touch at certain points, but most people would be willing to overlook these flaws because the focus has always been on the people and relationships in the narrative. One criticism has been that the dialogue can be forced and cheesy.\n\nFinally, the dealbreaker.\n\nI regret to say that the closing episode really killed the entire game for me. I’ll always have fondness for the first four episodes, but in Episode 5, the game tried too hard to be things that it was not and decided to shelf the minor details in favour of the main ‘story’ about Max and Chloe. Perhaps a prudent decision, but not particularly satisfying or helpful lore-wise when you remember that many potential plot points, like the overarching influence of the Prescott family, the strange popularity of the missing girl Rachel Amber, and the native American symbolism woven like a thread throughout the fabric of the game, all remained woefully underused. Even things that were directly mentioned in the game went neglected in the final episode.\n\nBearing in mind the deeper sufferings and motivations of even the side characters, the story’s main villain was a mere caricature by the beginning of Episode 5. The first half an hour or so was a mad rush of exposition and nonsensical ramblings of a madman. Not exactly the best use of your time and resources, DONTNOD. Then, the game takes you through a series of trippy dreamscapes – very out-of-place, considering that although Max’s powers are very magical, she’s always dealt with reality and the myriad possibilities that are constantly in flux through the narrative. The hour or so of navigating unrealistic nightmares suddenly felt very foreign and overused to me – what is with everyone who wants the player to experience some kind of bizarre psychological acid trip within the game? (Far Cry 3 boss battles anyone?) Also, it was a poor choice to spend all that time recapping the ‘crucial’ moments of the game while the episode was in progress. People forgave the atrocity of this episode precisely because of the attachments they had formed to Chloe and Max – there was definitely no need to remind us of the emotional moments again. Then, the classic Mass Effect 3 mistake. Red, Green or Blue (although there were only two choices in this game) that served to negate every single meaningful decision in this game. Perhaps it was fitting that Chloe has to remind Max that we live for the journey and not the destination – perhaps they anticipated the criticism and meant that to be a direct message for the player, because that definitely reverberated through the fourth wall and felt like a patronizing, direct slap to the face.\n\nSorry, DONTNOD. I’ve been known to revisit games and replay them countless times, but Episode 5 wasn’t a closer, it really was the nail in the coffin.\n\nRating: “Was it all wasted, all that love?” 5/10, 5 whole points taken off for the disappointing finisher. Play for the first four episodes and just write your own fanfic ending afterward.","October 20, 2015","true","2.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I can say that this is my personal pick for Game of the Year 2015. I avoided every YouTube videos to prevent spoilers, so I walked in absolutely not knowing what to expect. This will be a short and unorganized review (because I suck at writing reviews) and I'll try to keep it spoiler free.\n\nFirst things first, I gotta get it outta the way. I absolutely love the artistic style of this game. As a person who loves art and knows a little bit about photography it's great to see the amazing shots during the cutscenes and the game's use of depth of field. Every photo that you look at are beautifully hand painted. The game overall is just gorgeous to look at.\n\nThe beginning of Episode 1 started off pretty slow, but that's to be pretty much expected, so that wasn't a big deal. I was being introduced to a majority of the main characters. A couple of minutes in and I already like the main character. First thing that I do notice and like is how well the game puts the player in this school atmosphere. I felt like I was a part of the class.\n\nEpisode 2: Probably my favorite episode and most hated episode overall, probably due to it being mostly about my favorite character in the game. I have never felt so nervous and tense in a while from a video game. But I'm happy with the result that I received. So, why do I also hate this episode? ♥♥♥♥ the bottle sequence! That part was tedious, stupid and it took me forever to find all of them.\n\nEpisode 3: I WAS EATING THOSE BEANS! But seriously, don't mess with Frank and his beans. I was pretty mixed on this episode. But of course, the ending got me again. Man... ♥♥♥♥ rewind powers.\n\nEpisode 4: I ♥♥♥♥ing knew it! God, I never been so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at a character before in my life. I legit wanted to strangle the ♥♥♥♥ outta the jackass dude when I found those pictures of my favorite character. But aside from my anger at the series of events... Great episode! The beginning made me shed a tear.\n\nEpisode 5: ♥♥♥♥... (Sorry, not much can be said, you just have to play for yourselves)\n\nMy overall feelings towards the game. I absolutely loved it! Normally I don't like time traveling because that topic is always complicated as ♥♥♥♥, but I felt like the rewind mechanic was great. You telling me I get to talk ♥♥♥♥, spill your food and beer, rewind and pretend I didn't do any of that? Awesome, sign me up! But it's also interesting that I can always take back the previous choice that I've made. That alone made me really overthink my decisions. "Do I want this? But maybe this would be better in the future..." I literally spent 10 minutes thinking to myself over the final choice. Also, another thing I loved is the fact that the game DOESN'T ♥♥♥♥ING RUSH ME TO MAKE A CHOICE. ♥♥♥♥ off Telltale, how can I make an important decision that matters in less than 5 second?\n\nNow, I've played the Telltale games, I loved The Walking Dead (season 1) and The Wolf Amoung Us. But I absolutely hate The Game of Thrones. TWD season 2 while was decent, it got stale... Real stale. I didn't play Tales from the Borderlands, so I can't judge that game. But to me, Telltale games feels like they're becoming the Call of Duty of this interactive storytelling genre. They don't change a single thing to keep me engaged to the game. They also like to lie to you about saying how your choices matter. When was the last time any of your choices actually mattered?\nAt least in Life is Strange, while some decisions are pretty minor, most actually do have an affect towards how certain characters react and respond to you.\n\nAs for the ending of Life is Strange. I cried like a little baby, no lie. This was the hardest decision for me to make. While it was a predictable ending, I saw it coming. I still wasn't prepared for it. Something I don't understand is why people complain about the ending. I personally thought that it was well made. Sometimes in life, there are things that aren't meant to be changed. No matter how much you try. No matter how much you take things back... You simply cannot escape destiny. I feel like that's what the game's message is.\n\nOkay so since I tried my best to prevent spoilers. Would I recommend this? "Hella yeah!" Get this ♥♥♥♥ing game now, play it! Make friends, make enemies. Play as the best fictional hipster girl ever made. Make stupid life decisions. Go ape! Ape ape ape!\n\n\nMASSIVE SPOILERS here regarding the ending that I chose, I just have to let this out because it hurts.\n\nChloe, there was only so many times I could save you from death.\nI can't keep rewinding time or even create a different reality only to cause another natural disaster for this town and the next.\nNow, I loved and cared this girl to no end, she really was like a real best friend. She was extremely impulsive, ♥♥♥♥♥y, a real trouble maker, I could go on. But she showed me nothing but her loyalty and love. All of these things are what made her who she was. I would never change anything about her.\nAll of the laughs we shared, the fights we had, it pains me to know that you won't remember any of it.\nYou were never alone in this world, Chloe. I was and will always be there for you.\nWell, it's time to say my goodbyes. Rachel's waiting for you, Chloe. I'll see you later.\nRest In Peace...","November 25, 2015","true","33.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Add this game to the very very short list that actually had me in tears (ps: Mass Effect is the other one)\n\nThe game starts out as a classic young adult drama with a supernatural twist. The further you get into the game, the more you will see that it goes way, way beyond that. If the first one or two episodes made you think 'meh, what's the big deal?', I strongly advise you to keep playing.\n\nThe writing is absolutely amazing, and the game perhaps contains one of the best pieces of character development I have ever seen. None of the characters you encounter in the entire story has a flat personality: They all have their own layers, faults, imperfections, which makes it entirely realistic and not at all annoying. Even the know-it-all hipster main character shows you that there is much more to it than that.\n\nSometimes the game gets a little bit overdramatic and emo, especially when you choose actions such as sitting on a tree trunk or a bench in the park. However, later on, this turns out to be rather valuable to your own perception of the story and the character itself.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit confusing at the start. It takes a bit to figure out what to do. After a while you pick things up much more quickly, yet the "puzzles" still stay complicated enough to make you think and reconsider every now and then. There was perhaps a bit too little rewind action in the general story for my likings, though.\n\nThe decision-making-system is great in the sense that you can rewind and undo bad mistakes. The main character will, however, make you doubt whether you made the right decision in the first place. There are hardly any black or white decisions, most of them require some thinking about morals, ethics, and consequences. I have found myself going back and forth between two decisions quite a lot, only to realise afterwards that I should have probably done something differently.\n\nAll in all, this is an amazing game, and I would absolutely recommend it to everybody who likes to get emotionally invested in interesting characters.","November 21, 2015","true","12.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WiiWalker/recommended/319630/","WiiWalker","WiiWalker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WiiWalker/","527 products in account","tl;dr:\n\nThis game is extremely well written and carefully put together to bring us one of the best story-driven game to date. The sheer amount of secrets and details which await at every corner of Arcadia Bay is mind blowing. You are missing out on the speculations and the anticipation until the next Episode if you're not already playing this before the release of Episode 5, but you're very welcome to start playing this afterwards too.\n\nLife Is Strange is an interactive story telling game about high school drama, making decisions, drugs and alcohol, mobbing, time travel and mysteries.\n\nI've never come across a game that told me watering my plant would have consequences. 10/10\n\nLong Version:\nContains minor spoilers from the beginning of Episode 1 (blacked out)\n\nLife Is StrangeLife Is Strange brings us indeed the strangest story about Life spiced up with just the right amount of fiction. You're playing as Maxine Caulfield, the main protagonist, who is an 18-year-old aspiring photographer and senior at Blackwell Academy. You've been in Seattle for a while but went back to your childhood town Arcadia Bay to study photography.\n\nThe game starts with you waking up in class after a nightmare where you're seeing a storm. Everything seems fine and boring as always. You're in middle of class and don't know the answers to the question the teacher is asking. So after class finishes you walk through the hallway to the bathroom to splash some water onto you're face. This is where the magic happens. A beautiful blue butterfly flies through the window and you get the photo opportunity of your life. The butterfly seems to glow and you feel something strange. Suddenly a boy gets into the girls restroom and is panicking about something you're about to find out. Another girl is coming in and they get into a dispute until the boy brings up his weapon and shoots. You're reaching out a hand as if it could change anything and then it happens.\n\nThe game starts with you waking up in class after a you've witnessed a girl die in the bathroom. Everything seems fine and boring as always except you're highly tensed and hoping that you've dreamed again. You're remembering and retracing everything that had happened(?) in class before and try out your newly discovered ability. Congratulations, you're a human time machine! You don't want that poor girl in the restroom to die and have to prevent the boy from shooting her. Yet again you're going to the bathroom but this time it's with other intentions. You retrace everything: splash you're face with water, a butterfly flies through the window, you take a photo and the boy comes in. This is it, you have to do something. Afraid that the boy could hurt you, you trigger the fire alarm and everyone gets out of school. You've successfully altered time. Later you find out that this girl is Chloe Elizabeth Price, your childhood friend that you've left alone when you moved to Seattle with your parents.\n\nFrom now on things are getting stranger and stranger as you play through each of the chapters and episodes. Episode 1 gives you plenty of time to sit down and relax and in general just allow you to enjoy the atmosphere of the game. From the second Episode onwards, you discover a fair amount of secrets about Arcadia Bay, it's characters and secrets. The story-telling is mesmerizing and I couldn't stop playing just because I wanted to find out what it is going on in that town.\n\nEvery choice you make actually affect the past, present and future.\n\nCharacters\nMax\nMaxine Caulfield is the main protagonist and has the ability to manipulate time and space by rewinding and changing her choices. She loves photography and art.\n\nChloe\nChloe Elizabeth Price is Max's childhood friend and a rebel. She was best friends with Rachel Amber who disappeared suddenly a while ago. Chloe has blue hair and cool punk clothes. Do I have to say more?\n\nRachel\nRachel Dawn Amber was best friends with Chloe before she disappeared. No one knows where she went or if she is still alive. The police already stopped searching but Chloe is still desperately looking out to find her.\n\nNathan\nNathaniel Joshua Prescott is a student at Blackwell Academy and has rich and influential parents. Why did he meet up with Cloe and what is wrong with him?\n\nThese are just a few of the main characters and there are many more to discover in the game. The story around these characters is well written and we get to learn about both their good and bad sides. We have a fair amount of time to discover the secrets and mysteries which contribute well to the main story of the game.\n\nMusic\nThe music in this game fits so well with the characters and the story like no game I've ever played. It adds a ton to the atmosphere and character development as we find out about their miseries and feelings. Each and every track and it's lyrics fit perfectly to the situation and have a much deeper meaning and ongoing message to transmit if you listen cautiously. These are instant must haves as you listen to them and they stick in your heads with each mind blowing new discovery you make.\n\nConclusion\nI've already spent a lot of time with this game and am shocked by all the little details the developer thought of. There are a lot of tiny secrets waiting in every corner of Arcadia Bay to be found by you. The concept of time traveling mixed with the case of a lost girl keep you eager to play just a little more until it's too late to get enough sleep for work/school.\n\nThis game is both emotionally and story-wise very heart touching and intense. The consequences of each decision you make are so real that you keep finding yourself rewinding time over and over again to weigh up the pros and cons of the choice you make. And you're only going to find out what happens next if you've decided and are ready to move on. This already is a lecture for life and the game offers so many more.\n\nLife Is Strange is an interactive story telling game about high school drama, making decisions, drugs and alcohol, mobbing, time travel and mysteries.\n\nI've never come across a game that told me watering my plant would have consequences. 10/10\n\n\nIf you need any help or want someone to talk please feel free to visit http://lifeisstrange.com/talk/","August 10, 2015","true","158.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lufiales/recommended/319630/","lufiales","✪ konbleck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lufiales/","355 products in account","Review for full gameThis game kind of shows what happens when a group of women stays together for a long time: problems. Haha. Just kidding. Let’s move on for the good part.\nFirst, I will start with a short plot summary.\n"An unconfident photography student discovers that she has the ability to rewind time. After reuniting with her estranged best friend, she uses her new found ability to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a local girl."\n"Life is Strange may poke holes in its mechanics when it sees fit, but it a does a damn good job of letting you know that every little thing you do is contributing to a powerful butterfly effect."\n\nSo, this game has interesting story and characters, beautiful hand-painted art and visuals, nice and relaxing soundtrack. It has good puzzles, but some of them can be tedious and confusing at first. But some puzzles get easier if you explore. This game rewards you for exploring. So, explore the most you can. Exploring helps with character development, too.\n\nThis game has maybe the best voice acting I’ve ever seen in this type of games. It helps you to set the mood. It provides a perfect combination of music for every mood and action, too. It can provide you a various mix of all emotions: it can make you feel good about a decision you made before and then BOOM!!! The game pulls out a "get rekt son!" with scenes capable of making some tough guys cry like babies and make your brain turn upside down. It's like a tsunami of feels all of sudden. Maybe it is this way because it tries to focus in stuff from the real world. In my gaming years, only 3 games made me tear up a bit: BioShock Infinite, The Walking Dead game series (by Telltale games) and Life is Strange.\n\nI may use some spoilers but I will hide all of them, so before starting, let me just leave here a ***SPOILER WARNING***. And in the end of my essay ( xD ) I will put a TL;DR just for the people who just want to go straight to the point.\n\nIf you like games where your smallest decision can have a huge impact later and you can feel the same as the main character, then this game is for you.\nThis game is a masterpiece from Square Enix and DONTNOD Entertainment. It may change your life perspective and your attitudes. This deserves a 10/10.\n\n(Be prepared for my longest review ever. This game deserves it.)\nReview for Episode 1The game starts slowly, as intended. Presenting the characters slowly and showing you the people and the place. And suddenly, “a wild rushing crazy moment appears”. You need to think fast to figure what to do next. When you do it and pass that moment, BAM! You feel a bit of mystery right in your face. Then, you’re back to earth and when it seems that nothing can go wrong, you see that you got yourself in a moment of taking a decision. You may think that it’s not that important, but believe me: it is. If you want to play the whole game, every decision counts. This episode has happy moments, sad moments, crazy moments, important moments, … You will see the importance of this moments later. In fact, at the next episode you will start to see the consequences. That’s why I love this game so much. And if you already bought it and you liked this episode, you will love the next one. Well, I see that this review is going to be long. :-) I give this episode a 9/10.\n\nReview for Episode 2I enjoyed this episode more than I did the first. In this episode you will already see some impact of the choices you made before. It has the hardest decision I had to make in any game of this kind: choosing between a Bacon omelette or Belgian waffles for breakfast.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\nThere's some stuff about this episode that some players may find cheesy. But the climax was really moving and thrilling. It will make you care about a character, trust me. That sequence takes its emotion/feels hammer and hits you like a train. Like I said before in this review, in my gaming life only a few games made me tear up a bit. But this gave me the most mixed feelings. They absolutely nailed it with this ending. You won’t feel a thing if you are as sensitive as a brick. You will feel the emotions I’m trying to explain, especially if you have, like me, some closest friend that has been in a similar situation. You will get to what I’m saying when you play this episode. I give this a 10/10.\n\nReview for Episode 3In this episode you will have, one more time, one of the hardest decision to make: choose between Pancakes and Eggs and bacon. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\nThis episode has more definition of the characters, the story gets deeper and it helps to better understand what happens around you. There’s no real puzzles in this episode, but you will have your time to do a “small exploring” and making some important decisions. Some of them will have a huge impact on the next episodes, and I believe some will have impact in a season 2, too (season 2 HYPE!!!). You will have a real definition of what Max is capable of with her powers. And that will lead you to the ending of this episode: a heart-wrenching moment where you will be asking: “What have I done…?”. I give it a 9/10.\n\nReview for Episode 4Have you ever felt hopeless or angry and sad at the same time or guilty of something really bad? If you haven’t, this episode will make you learn it. The way this episode starts (including the end of episode 3) and the way it goes it’s so sad that it made me cr…… *cough* sweat from my eyeballs. Then ninjas came and made everything worse with their onions. This game really knows how to get you in the feelings’ train. Well, moving on. This episode has a really tricky puzzle. But it gets way easier if you explore every time you can. Explore everything. Even the smallest detail or object can help you figuring the puzzle quicker and developing the character and what you know about them. The story will be developing well. And the ending of this episode… Oh my! What an end! Some people may have some clues about it when it became near (because of the characters involved and the way how they talk and the tone of their voices), but for me it was a total surprise. This deserves a 10/10.\n\nReview for Episode 5This episode is the best of them all, in my opinion. It will put you and your previous actions/feelings to the test. In the previous episodes you only talk and make small choices, for example: choosing who’s side you will pick. Episode 4 already start to test your choices but it’s in this fifth episode that you will have the real test: “Episode 5's final choice asks you to put your actions where your mouth is”. It will be really hard to choose (unless you’re a “cold ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥” and choose in 2 seconds) because you lose either way. Like some comment I read somewhere: “that ending made both seasons of The Walking Dead look like comedies by comparison”. I had to pause to think about that final decision, and I did it for a long time.\nAnd now, after playing the whole game again, I need to ride "a shark with two hundred and fifty pounds of dynamite strapped to my chest into the mouth of an active volcano" while holding two grenades with my hands to feel manly again. My rating: 10/10.\n\nTL;DRThis game kind of has a perfect combination of all this: good graphics, good story and plot, good characters, good puzzles, amazing soundtrack and voice acting.\nAs I posted before, if you like games where your smallest decision can have a huge impact later and you can feel the same as the main character, then this game is for you.\nThis game is a masterpiece from Square Enix and DONTNOD Entertainment. It may change your life perspective and your attitudes. This deserves a 10/10.\nAnd we need season 2, please. :-)","October 26, 2015","true","36.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

The summary of the Steam reviews sums it up really well: "overwhelmingly positive".\n\nThe story is deep and great. The graphics are really good-looking. The gameplay is really enjoyable, and relaxing. You could really well compare it to Telltale's style, even though I think it is even better: more polished, on a better engine, and with a deeper story. It's hard to review it like this.\n\nDon't play this game if you expect something adventure-like, and adrenaline-based, even if you'll get some; the pace of Life is Strange is quite relaxing, and you'll end up believing you're Max, a high-school photography student. Who can control time.\n\nThe fact that it's episodic really bodes well. Some people won't like it; but I do like playing episodes as they come out, it keeps it fresh. Of course, I can't say the next episodes will be good at the time I'm writing this, but I can't see how they could be bad.\n\nIf this review makes you interested in the game, or even excites you, just p l a y  i t  a l r e a d y.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harmani/recommended/319630/","Harmani","!o","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harmani/","81 products in account","Okay, so I have had a bit of a love-hate relationship with this game. But not because it's terrible, nor that its characters are written badly or anything like that; it's because I get so immersed in the story and the characters that I couldn't help but feel annoyed about ____ happening or freaking out when presented with a scary choice that could impact the story. I personally had no problem with the conclusion of the story, I saw it coming. It was meant to happen that way and I think the main reason some people probably don't like the ending is because it made them feel something, and that something was definitely not a happy feeling (at least for me), but it was predictable (there were a lot of hints to that being the ultimate choice).\n\nIf you like immersive, great storylines then get this game. If you've been through or witnessed any situation in this game then you will more than likely feel something or connect with the game in some way, I certainly did at numerous points.\n\nFor me, I was initially annoyed at the terrible teenage stereotypes that were prevalent throughout the story to begin with - but the thing is, the characters develop into complex people with their own issues, insecurities and problems. It depends on both your mindset that you have going into the game and the choices you make as to whether you reveal the multidimensional aspects of a character or not. I think the main reason as to why I was initially annoyed at the stereotypes was because it's a disappointing reflection of reality in some cases, so I guess connecting those situations to real situations probably was what annoyed me, and I think it was a good thing that it did annoy me - it meant I'd connected with the game on some level.\n\nThe game has both a great storyline and a sufficiently large, but not overwhelming, range of environments/minor storylines to explore and sometimes missing small details in these can affect the future, perhaps even without you realising. I know that in my first playthrough I had no idea about some choices you could make because they weren't obvious and required thorough exploration (which I didn't initially bother to do, because I was so sucked into the main storyline). I bought the complete season pass a while ago, I don't regret doing so. I will do it for season 2 (I believe there is a season 2 coming up) because LiS has definitely gotten me interested in this genre.\n\nI will say this though. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ THOSE CHOICES GIVING ME HEART ATTACKS! I would literally sit there thinking "oh my god what do I do" and leave the choice up for a good 5 - 10 minutes before deciding to follow through with one. Prepare to have mild strokes every time you get presented with a choice.\n\nTL;DR: Get this game. It's good fun, I couldn't stop playing it and it gave me heart problems every time I had a choice, so 10/10 for that. You always want to know what happens, there's always some twist or a situation that makes you feel something. It's quite a human game.\n\nIf you're not sure about it, then get the first episode and play it through to the end. From there you'll be able to tell if you like the style of the game. I think I bought LiS at full price and it is actually worth it. I was really surprised episode 1 was priced at £3.99. I think on a previous sale it was taken down to like £1.99 or so, so if you're into sales then definitely get it if you see it on sale. It's already cheap as it is though, for the content and replayability IMO, as well as the quality of the story and characters.\n\nI'm probably going to replay this game as well. Technically I haven't "finished" it because I'm stuck with a terrible laptop that won't run the final scenes. But it's cool, I don't blame the game, I blame this awful laptop.","October 31, 2015","true","27.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's the first game, at least that I have played, that gets the interactive game-but-really-a-movie right. A big part of this is the rewind mechanic. It fits in perfectly with the surreal, kind of magic realism feel it's going for, but it also allows you to explore any and all choices you make without any (immediate) consequences. That's always been a big turn-off in Telltale Games: sometimes the protagonist will word things differently than you expected and you'd wish you could make a different choice. Well here you can, and it actually makes sense from the story's perspective.\n\nThe game feels like the interactive love child of Juno and Veronica Mars, with hints of The Butterfly Effect. The visual style really works for this kind of story and the audio is spot-on. Max is really fleshed out as a character and is not just a carta blanca waiting to be filled in by your imagination, which is great.\n\nPlay this game, and watch your sympathy for hipsters grow. I expect the full game to last about 15 (well filled) hours for a single, slow-pace playthrough, so take from that what you will.\n\nPost-finale addendum\n\nIt's great. The final few episodes are one heck of a rollercoaster. All in all I can tell you that the story isn't particularly innovative, the graphics aren't the greatest, and sometimes the dialogue gets a bit too Dawson's Creek for my taste.\n\nBut beyond that the voice acting is amazing and the music is incredibly atmospheric. The characters are very believable and relatable and even though the story may not be innovative, it's done very well.

Also, the story is slow at first, but once you get to Episode 3, it draws you in, keeping you more interested, and Episode 1 and 2 are more of tutorials, where they show you functions in the game, one being learnt very early on which is using dialogue heard once, going back, and saying it to them. Now would be a good time to pick it up since all Five episodes are out and playable, and throughout my play, I hadn't encountered any glitches so Dontnod has that safe for me :D:. Another thing, this is a warning, the game touches many soft subjects, for examples constant bullying, and don't pick it up if you are a person who either dislikes anything involving that, getting affended, or has experience with it and feels as if it will bring bad memories.\nOne amazing thing about it is the soundtrack, after each great indie song I heard, I looked it up, found the artist, listen to their songs, and enjoy all the music, the people in charge of music choice did such an amazing job in picking songs, props to them :LIS_flower:. Now I would support watching videos on it to see if it is your thing, but I would NOT support watching any videos past 2, at most, because all after that is way better going through blind. Finally, the game contains both straight and gay/lesbian kissing, so if one is against that, they may not like it, but it is optional for both so you can avoid it if wanted.\n\n\nShort Review: You like time travel, eh? You like TellTale Game choices, eh? You like School settings, eh? You like a rebelious teen, eh? You like photography and easy to hunt collectables, eh? And you like amazing Indie Music, eh?\n\n-  I believe this game would be for you :Neko::LIS_butterfly:","November 27, 2015","true","21.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WiiWalker/recommended/319630/","WiiWalker","WiiWalker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WiiWalker/","527 products in account","tl;dr:\n\nThis game is extremely well written and carefully put together to bring us one of the best story-driven game to date. The sheer amount of secrets and details which await at every corner of Arcadia Bay is mind blowing. You are missing out on the speculations and the anticipation until the next Episode if you're not already playing this before the release of Episode 5, but you're very welcome to start playing this afterwards too.\n\nLife Is Strange is an interactive story telling game about high school drama, making decisions, drugs and alcohol, mobbing, time travel and mysteries.\n\nI've never come across a game that told me watering my plant would have consequences. 10/10\n\nLong Version:\nContains minor spoilers from the beginning of Episode 1 (blacked out)\n\nLife Is StrangeLife Is Strange brings us indeed the strangest story about Life spiced up with just the right amount of fiction. You're playing as Maxine Caulfield, the main protagonist, who is an 18-year-old aspiring photographer and senior at Blackwell Academy. You've been in Seattle for a while but went back to your childhood town Arcadia Bay to study photography.\n\nThe game starts with you waking up in class after a nightmare where you're seeing a storm. Everything seems fine and boring as always. You're in middle of class and don't know the answers to the question the teacher is asking. So after class finishes you walk through the hallway to the bathroom to splash some water onto you're face. This is where the magic happens. A beautiful blue butterfly flies through the window and you get the photo opportunity of your life. The butterfly seems to glow and you feel something strange. Suddenly a boy gets into the girls restroom and is panicking about something you're about to find out. Another girl is coming in and they get into a dispute until the boy brings up his weapon and shoots. You're reaching out a hand as if it could change anything and then it happens.\n\nThe game starts with you waking up in class after a you've witnessed a girl die in the bathroom. Everything seems fine and boring as always except you're highly tensed and hoping that you've dreamed again. You're remembering and retracing everything that had happened(?) in class before and try out your newly discovered ability. Congratulations, you're a human time machine! You don't want that poor girl in the restroom to die and have to prevent the boy from shooting her. Yet again you're going to the bathroom but this time it's with other intentions. You retrace everything: splash you're face with water, a butterfly flies through the window, you take a photo and the boy comes in. This is it, you have to do something. Afraid that the boy could hurt you, you trigger the fire alarm and everyone gets out of school. You've successfully altered time. Later you find out that this girl is Chloe Elizabeth Price, your childhood friend that you've left alone when you moved to Seattle with your parents.\n\nFrom now on things are getting stranger and stranger as you play through each of the chapters and episodes. Episode 1 gives you plenty of time to sit down and relax and in general just allow you to enjoy the atmosphere of the game. From the second Episode onwards, you discover a fair amount of secrets about Arcadia Bay, it's characters and secrets. The story-telling is mesmerizing and I couldn't stop playing just because I wanted to find out what it is going on in that town.\n\nEvery choice you make actually affect the past, present and future.\n\nCharacters\nMax\nMaxine Caulfield is the main protagonist and has the ability to manipulate time and space by rewinding and changing her choices. She loves photography and art.\n\nChloe\nChloe Elizabeth Price is Max's childhood friend and a rebel. She was best friends with Rachel Amber who disappeared suddenly a while ago. Chloe has blue hair and cool punk clothes. Do I have to say more?\n\nRachel\nRachel Dawn Amber was best friends with Chloe before she disappeared. No one knows where she went or if she is still alive. The police already stopped searching but Chloe is still desperately looking out to find her.\n\nNathan\nNathaniel Joshua Prescott is a student at Blackwell Academy and has rich and influential parents. Why did he meet up with Cloe and what is wrong with him?\n\nThese are just a few of the main characters and there are many more to discover in the game. The story around these characters is well written and we get to learn about both their good and bad sides. We have a fair amount of time to discover the secrets and mysteries which contribute well to the main story of the game.\n\nMusic\nThe music in this game fits so well with the characters and the story like no game I've ever played. It adds a ton to the atmosphere and character development as we find out about their miseries and feelings. Each and every track and it's lyrics fit perfectly to the situation and have a much deeper meaning and ongoing message to transmit if you listen cautiously. These are instant must haves as you listen to them and they stick in your heads with each mind blowing new discovery you make.\n\nConclusion\nI've already spent a lot of time with this game and am shocked by all the little details the developer thought of. There are a lot of tiny secrets waiting in every corner of Arcadia Bay to be found by you. The concept of time traveling mixed with the case of a lost girl keep you eager to play just a little more until it's too late to get enough sleep for work/school.\n\nThis game is both emotionally and story-wise very heart touching and intense. The consequences of each decision you make are so real that you keep finding yourself rewinding time over and over again to weigh up the pros and cons of the choice you make. And you're only going to find out what happens next if you've decided and are ready to move on. This already is a lecture for life and the game offers so many more.\n\nLife Is Strange is an interactive story telling game about high school drama, making decisions, drugs and alcohol, mobbing, time travel and mysteries.\n\nI've never come across a game that told me watering my plant would have consequences. 10/10\n\n\nIf you need any help or want someone to talk please feel free to visit http://lifeisstrange.com/talk/","August 10, 2015","true","158.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not only the beautiful-vintage scenery or the pitch perfect soundtrack, but the story along the character that makes this game so intensely important. Why do I recommend this game to absolutely everyone? Because of all the things you can learn from it, which can be resumed in this: 'Everyone is fighting a battle you don't know about, be kind, always'. This beautiful yet painful story will teach you a lot of values you'll need for you everyday life, will teach you to make the right decisions because no matter how little they are, your decision matters.

Oh god this game right here. Let me explain to you the love that I have for this game in the best way I can: This game is literally everything I have ever wanted in a game. It has the best story I have ever seen in a game, and I mean that as a lover of all the telltale games, mass effect, any story rich game thats out there I have probably played and loved. As a matter of fact The Walking Dead was my favorite game of all time. WAS. Then this game happened.\n\nThe feels that this game makes you feel are unlike any feels you have felt at a game. Everything in this game is so relatable and real. The focus of this game is around friendship and average teenager life, and everyone can relate to that because they have been through it. This game is one you show to your friends because you know they can relate to it and love the game as much as you do. This is the only game that has truly messed me up so bad that I couldn't sleep because I was thinking about what I had just seen (looking at you episode 4). You may not have the same impact I did because you may not be able to relate as much as I did to this game, but there is a good chance you will.\n\nOh and don't even get me started on the soundtrack. The soundtrack on this game will change your music preferences. Seriously its that good. This game uses a combination of liscensed and original music and does it really, really well. I mean really well.\n\nNow about the voice acting. Holy ♥♥♥♥ the voice actors are phenomenal. They do such a good job of displaying emotion in very pivotal scenes in the game and you can just feel it. Its so good. Not to mention the art style and the way the characters act and look work very well. Its a very immersive game in that regard. There's nothing thats going to pull you out of the immersion in the game and it does very well in episodic format. You should take this game in chunks, episode by episode, so you don't stop in the middle an episode and pull yourself out of the game. You won't get the same impact that way.\n\nIf you are thinking about getting this game, do yourself a huge favor and do. It is so worth it if you want one of the most special, beautiful, heartfelt, and real gaming experience you have ever had. That is if you like story based games and are ok with not having quick time events or heavy amount of interactivity at all times. If you are ok with that, then buy this game as soon as you possibly can. Seriously do it.","August 20, 2015","true","25.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lufiales/recommended/319630/","lufiales","✪ konbleck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lufiales/","355 products in account","Review for full gameThis game kind of shows what happens when a group of women stays together for a long time: problems. Haha. Just kidding. Let’s move on for the good part.\nFirst, I will start with a short plot summary.\n"An unconfident photography student discovers that she has the ability to rewind time. After reuniting with her estranged best friend, she uses her new found ability to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a local girl."\n"Life is Strange may poke holes in its mechanics when it sees fit, but it a does a damn good job of letting you know that every little thing you do is contributing to a powerful butterfly effect."\n\nSo, this game has interesting story and characters, beautiful hand-painted art and visuals, nice and relaxing soundtrack. It has good puzzles, but some of them can be tedious and confusing at first. But some puzzles get easier if you explore. This game rewards you for exploring. So, explore the most you can. Exploring helps with character development, too.\n\nThis game has maybe the best voice acting I’ve ever seen in this type of games. It helps you to set the mood. It provides a perfect combination of music for every mood and action, too. It can provide you a various mix of all emotions: it can make you feel good about a decision you made before and then BOOM!!! The game pulls out a "get rekt son!" with scenes capable of making some tough guys cry like babies and make your brain turn upside down. It's like a tsunami of feels all of sudden. Maybe it is this way because it tries to focus in stuff from the real world. In my gaming years, only 3 games made me tear up a bit: BioShock Infinite, The Walking Dead game series (by Telltale games) and Life is Strange.\n\nI may use some spoilers but I will hide all of them, so before starting, let me just leave here a ***SPOILER WARNING***. And in the end of my essay ( xD ) I will put a TL;DR just for the people who just want to go straight to the point.\n\nIf you like games where your smallest decision can have a huge impact later and you can feel the same as the main character, then this game is for you.\nThis game is a masterpiece from Square Enix and DONTNOD Entertainment. It may change your life perspective and your attitudes. This deserves a 10/10.\n\n(Be prepared for my longest review ever. This game deserves it.)\nReview for Episode 1The game starts slowly, as intended. Presenting the characters slowly and showing you the people and the place. And suddenly, “a wild rushing crazy moment appears”. You need to think fast to figure what to do next. When you do it and pass that moment, BAM! You feel a bit of mystery right in your face. Then, you’re back to earth and when it seems that nothing can go wrong, you see that you got yourself in a moment of taking a decision. You may think that it’s not that important, but believe me: it is. If you want to play the whole game, every decision counts. This episode has happy moments, sad moments, crazy moments, important moments, … You will see the importance of this moments later. In fact, at the next episode you will start to see the consequences. That’s why I love this game so much. And if you already bought it and you liked this episode, you will love the next one. Well, I see that this review is going to be long. :-) I give this episode a 9/10.\n\nReview for Episode 2I enjoyed this episode more than I did the first. In this episode you will already see some impact of the choices you made before. It has the hardest decision I had to make in any game of this kind: choosing between a Bacon omelette or Belgian waffles for breakfast.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\nThere's some stuff about this episode that some players may find cheesy. But the climax was really moving and thrilling. It will make you care about a character, trust me. That sequence takes its emotion/feels hammer and hits you like a train. Like I said before in this review, in my gaming life only a few games made me tear up a bit. But this gave me the most mixed feelings. They absolutely nailed it with this ending. You won’t feel a thing if you are as sensitive as a brick. You will feel the emotions I’m trying to explain, especially if you have, like me, some closest friend that has been in a similar situation. You will get to what I’m saying when you play this episode. I give this a 10/10.\n\nReview for Episode 3In this episode you will have, one more time, one of the hardest decision to make: choose between Pancakes and Eggs and bacon. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\nThis episode has more definition of the characters, the story gets deeper and it helps to better understand what happens around you. There’s no real puzzles in this episode, but you will have your time to do a “small exploring” and making some important decisions. Some of them will have a huge impact on the next episodes, and I believe some will have impact in a season 2, too (season 2 HYPE!!!). You will have a real definition of what Max is capable of with her powers. And that will lead you to the ending of this episode: a heart-wrenching moment where you will be asking: “What have I done…?”. I give it a 9/10.\n\nReview for Episode 4Have you ever felt hopeless or angry and sad at the same time or guilty of something really bad? If you haven’t, this episode will make you learn it. The way this episode starts (including the end of episode 3) and the way it goes it’s so sad that it made me cr…… *cough* sweat from my eyeballs. Then ninjas came and made everything worse with their onions. This game really knows how to get you in the feelings’ train. Well, moving on. This episode has a really tricky puzzle. But it gets way easier if you explore every time you can. Explore everything. Even the smallest detail or object can help you figuring the puzzle quicker and developing the character and what you know about them. The story will be developing well. And the ending of this episode… Oh my! What an end! Some people may have some clues about it when it became near (because of the characters involved and the way how they talk and the tone of their voices), but for me it was a total surprise. This deserves a 10/10.\n\nReview for Episode 5This episode is the best of them all, in my opinion. It will put you and your previous actions/feelings to the test. In the previous episodes you only talk and make small choices, for example: choosing who’s side you will pick. Episode 4 already start to test your choices but it’s in this fifth episode that you will have the real test: “Episode 5's final choice asks you to put your actions where your mouth is”. It will be really hard to choose (unless you’re a “cold ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥” and choose in 2 seconds) because you lose either way. Like some comment I read somewhere: “that ending made both seasons of The Walking Dead look like comedies by comparison”. I had to pause to think about that final decision, and I did it for a long time.\nAnd now, after playing the whole game again, I need to ride "a shark with two hundred and fifty pounds of dynamite strapped to my chest into the mouth of an active volcano" while holding two grenades with my hands to feel manly again. My rating: 10/10.\n\nTL;DRThis game kind of has a perfect combination of all this: good graphics, good story and plot, good characters, good puzzles, amazing soundtrack and voice acting.\nAs I posted before, if you like games where your smallest decision can have a huge impact later and you can feel the same as the main character, then this game is for you.\nThis game is a masterpiece from Square Enix and DONTNOD Entertainment. It may change your life perspective and your attitudes. This deserves a 10/10.\nAnd we need season 2, please. :-)","October 26, 2015","true","36.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

They more the discover, the more in danger they become.\n\nIn this game you have to make desicions, and that may have some consequences in the future. If you rewind time and do things differently in the past, then it will alter the present and future. And that may be quite drastic. This game has five episodes, and I really liked the storyline and characters. I also thought the music they used were very suiting, and matched perfectly for the right atmosphere and mood. If they would sell a Life is Strange soundtrack I would buy it ^^\n\nAnyway, I would recommend this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lufiales/recommended/319630/","lufiales","✪ konbleck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lufiales/","355 products in account","Review for full gameThis game kind of shows what happens when a group of women stays together for a long time: problems. Haha. Just kidding. Let’s move on for the good part.\nFirst, I will start with a short plot summary.\n"An unconfident photography student discovers that she has the ability to rewind time. After reuniting with her estranged best friend, she uses her new found ability to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a local girl."\n"Life is Strange may poke holes in its mechanics when it sees fit, but it a does a damn good job of letting you know that every little thing you do is contributing to a powerful butterfly effect."\n\nSo, this game has interesting story and characters, beautiful hand-painted art and visuals, nice and relaxing soundtrack. It has good puzzles, but some of them can be tedious and confusing at first. But some puzzles get easier if you explore. This game rewards you for exploring. So, explore the most you can. Exploring helps with character development, too.\n\nThis game has maybe the best voice acting I’ve ever seen in this type of games. It helps you to set the mood. It provides a perfect combination of music for every mood and action, too. It can provide you a various mix of all emotions: it can make you feel good about a decision you made before and then BOOM!!! The game pulls out a "get rekt son!" with scenes capable of making some tough guys cry like babies and make your brain turn upside down. It's like a tsunami of feels all of sudden. Maybe it is this way because it tries to focus in stuff from the real world. In my gaming years, only 3 games made me tear up a bit: BioShock Infinite, The Walking Dead game series (by Telltale games) and Life is Strange.\n\nI may use some spoilers but I will hide all of them, so before starting, let me just leave here a ***SPOILER WARNING***. And in the end of my essay ( xD ) I will put a TL;DR just for the people who just want to go straight to the point.\n\nIf you like games where your smallest decision can have a huge impact later and you can feel the same as the main character, then this game is for you.\nThis game is a masterpiece from Square Enix and DONTNOD Entertainment. It may change your life perspective and your attitudes. This deserves a 10/10.\n\n(Be prepared for my longest review ever. This game deserves it.)\nReview for Episode 1The game starts slowly, as intended. Presenting the characters slowly and showing you the people and the place. And suddenly, “a wild rushing crazy moment appears”. You need to think fast to figure what to do next. When you do it and pass that moment, BAM! You feel a bit of mystery right in your face. Then, you’re back to earth and when it seems that nothing can go wrong, you see that you got yourself in a moment of taking a decision. You may think that it’s not that important, but believe me: it is. If you want to play the whole game, every decision counts. This episode has happy moments, sad moments, crazy moments, important moments, … You will see the importance of this moments later. In fact, at the next episode you will start to see the consequences. That’s why I love this game so much. And if you already bought it and you liked this episode, you will love the next one. Well, I see that this review is going to be long. :-) I give this episode a 9/10.\n\nReview for Episode 2I enjoyed this episode more than I did the first. In this episode you will already see some impact of the choices you made before. It has the hardest decision I had to make in any game of this kind: choosing between a Bacon omelette or Belgian waffles for breakfast.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\nThere's some stuff about this episode that some players may find cheesy. But the climax was really moving and thrilling. It will make you care about a character, trust me. That sequence takes its emotion/feels hammer and hits you like a train. Like I said before in this review, in my gaming life only a few games made me tear up a bit. But this gave me the most mixed feelings. They absolutely nailed it with this ending. You won’t feel a thing if you are as sensitive as a brick. You will feel the emotions I’m trying to explain, especially if you have, like me, some closest friend that has been in a similar situation. You will get to what I’m saying when you play this episode. I give this a 10/10.\n\nReview for Episode 3In this episode you will have, one more time, one of the hardest decision to make: choose between Pancakes and Eggs and bacon. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\nThis episode has more definition of the characters, the story gets deeper and it helps to better understand what happens around you. There’s no real puzzles in this episode, but you will have your time to do a “small exploring” and making some important decisions. Some of them will have a huge impact on the next episodes, and I believe some will have impact in a season 2, too (season 2 HYPE!!!). You will have a real definition of what Max is capable of with her powers. And that will lead you to the ending of this episode: a heart-wrenching moment where you will be asking: “What have I done…?”. I give it a 9/10.\n\nReview for Episode 4Have you ever felt hopeless or angry and sad at the same time or guilty of something really bad? If you haven’t, this episode will make you learn it. The way this episode starts (including the end of episode 3) and the way it goes it’s so sad that it made me cr…… *cough* sweat from my eyeballs. Then ninjas came and made everything worse with their onions. This game really knows how to get you in the feelings’ train. Well, moving on. This episode has a really tricky puzzle. But it gets way easier if you explore every time you can. Explore everything. Even the smallest detail or object can help you figuring the puzzle quicker and developing the character and what you know about them. The story will be developing well. And the ending of this episode… Oh my! What an end! Some people may have some clues about it when it became near (because of the characters involved and the way how they talk and the tone of their voices), but for me it was a total surprise. This deserves a 10/10.\n\nReview for Episode 5This episode is the best of them all, in my opinion. It will put you and your previous actions/feelings to the test. In the previous episodes you only talk and make small choices, for example: choosing who’s side you will pick. Episode 4 already start to test your choices but it’s in this fifth episode that you will have the real test: “Episode 5's final choice asks you to put your actions where your mouth is”. It will be really hard to choose (unless you’re a “cold ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥” and choose in 2 seconds) because you lose either way. Like some comment I read somewhere: “that ending made both seasons of The Walking Dead look like comedies by comparison”. I had to pause to think about that final decision, and I did it for a long time.\nAnd now, after playing the whole game again, I need to ride "a shark with two hundred and fifty pounds of dynamite strapped to my chest into the mouth of an active volcano" while holding two grenades with my hands to feel manly again. My rating: 10/10.\n\nTL;DRThis game kind of has a perfect combination of all this: good graphics, good story and plot, good characters, good puzzles, amazing soundtrack and voice acting.\nAs I posted before, if you like games where your smallest decision can have a huge impact later and you can feel the same as the main character, then this game is for you.\nThis game is a masterpiece from Square Enix and DONTNOD Entertainment. It may change your life perspective and your attitudes. This deserves a 10/10.\nAnd we need season 2, please. :-)","October 26, 2015","true","36.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

As you come to expect, it's a game that starts in a rather average pacing, yet achieves to grapple your attention with the first episode. It bears the micro-physics of an every day adventure game, yet the character development, climactic turnabouts, and the choices that will leave you in a hiatus, and make you stare at the screen hopelessly, are well-put. This is an important game that will be remembered as a milestone in the gaming industry.

I love this game beyond a doubt, and I wish more if not all games were more like it. The whole story up to the end you can see your choices matter and have effects which ones you live with is up to you. It's deep and pulls you in, they nailed this game, it's all kinds of amazing. As I mentioned before though it is a shattered dream, because as amazing as the whole game is and I still appreciate the endings. I see where they were going with an openish end with direction so the story kind of still goes on even though it ends. However the end is only decided by your last choice which is slightly betraying. In this game you will sit there and think which choice you should take, and that's where it feels like a betrayal. Your choices do affect the whole story up until the ending, the ending is decided by one decision. On one hand the story you've experienced obviously affects your final decision, but this game is all about the big picture.

The entire first episode I was laughing at how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cringe-worthy the dialogue was. It definitely improved in the second episode, but it wasn't until the third episode where it seemed like the characters actually began speaking and interacting like human beings. That's also the point where I got absolutely hooked.\n\nThe story was definitely better than I expected, and the further in you go the better it gets. Pair that with the overall solid performances, and it's pretty entertaining. Unlike similar games by other companies, choices actually matter beyond changing some dialogue. Also unlike similar games, this game actually has a game - with puzzles and ♥♥♥♥ rather than just picking dialogue and performing quick time events. The rewind feature is also cool, though at times felt tedious and tiresome. It also gets points for being absolutely gorgeous, using a (mostly) unique art style that looks great at almost all times.\n\nThe episodes are long, entertaining, and well-crafted (aside from dialogue in early episodes, as mentioned) - definitely worth their individual or bundled price tags. PLUS, IT HAS A DEMO. You don't have an excuse to not even try it out. Play the demo, and if you like it snag up the first episode. And if you like that, get the season pass.","December 23, 2015","true","10.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Após alguns acontecimentos incluindo a aparição de uma borboleta azul Max se vê em um pesadelo quando assisti a sua melhor amiga de infância Chloe Price ser assassinada na sua frente, nesse momento o desespero de Max é tão grande que sem querer ela acaba ganhando um poder misterioso de voltar no tempo, e acaba mudando todo o ocorrido, mas como o tio Ben fala "com grandes poderes vem grandes responsabilidades"  é missão de Max  ajudar sua amiga Chloe a desvendar os mistérios, e impedir uma catástrofe  que esta por vim. Life is Strange tem um enredo lindo e muito bem elaborado acompanhado de uma trilha sonora  impecável, e que conta com uma jogabilidade simples e divertida, que consiste em investigação e escolhas que podem alterar  o seu futuro, lembrando que pode voltar no tempo após ter feito alguma escolha que não nos agradou, o jogo também nos da a possibilidade de usar as informações de uma conversa já terminada para mudarmos o rumo da própria ou até mesmo de outra que venha a acontecer, além de que o retrocesso é essencial para prosseguir em algumas partes do game.\nAgrada principalmente aos apreciadores de grandes enredos com volta no tempo, é notável que o game teve grande influência de filmes como "efeito borboleta", e aqueles que têm paciência para explorar cenários e conversar com npc’s ( non-playable caracteres / personagens não jogáveis ) Life is Strange se encaixa perfeitamente com seus hábitos. Além disso, o que também auxilia muito a entender melhor todos os fatos que ocorrem durante o game é se atentar a leitura do diário de Max e de suas SMS’s (disponíveis quando se pausa o jogo). Mais do que mais uma obra de viagem no tempo e as consequências que isso pode gerar nas vidas (e no ambiente) dos personagens,  Life is Strange é sobre tomar decisões, sejam elas simples ou complexas. Jogo simplesmente incrível !","July 27, 2015","true","60.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Gorgeous visuals, incredible story, and captivating characters. Many parts of each installment had me gasping pretty loud/shouting "No Way" a tonne, and made me realise how insanely nosy I am (rumaging through bins, looking at peoples phones/tablets/PCs/staring at people/touching everything in sight).\nI adored games such as Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain, so Life Is Strange is obviously no exception to the rule of my favouritings. The main game mechanic (rewind), is excellent, and regardless of whether you rewind or not, most cases I was left panicking as to whether I had made the right decision or not. I also got so into it that at times in real life, I had a few occasions where I thought I could rewind time myself, haha...for example, I spilled my drink in the kitchen, and for a really fleeting moment my brain flickered with "Oops! Re..wind...wait...". I get way to into these types of games, for sure.\nThe voice acting is something left to be desired though. I mean, the individual dialogues are ok to some degree, but I'm pretty sure each actor was popped in a room by themselves with the script, with the person they are interacting with in the story dialogue in a different room altogether, mind. If I'm honest, this wasn't offputting to me, and actually made me giggle in some instances.\nI hope the series rolls on, and on, and on. Like my feelings with The Last of Us, this game will break my heart when it has to come to and end. I'll never get over it, haha!\n","June 28, 2015","true","26.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The decisions you make do impact the rest of the game, but not in the way you might think. Each decision does not send you on a completely different trajectory, but it does reverberate through the rest of the story in a way that makes it feel like it did impact the arc.\n\nAudio in this game is superb. I would consider Ashley Burch's voice acting to be one of the best performances in recent memory. Even excluding her, there is really no bad voice acting in the game. It's all far above par. In fact, I'm fairly sure that there is no time that a background piece of dialog is ever repeated. The amount of detail that goes into the audio of this game is incredible. There is one example that comes to memory: a cell phone placed near a speaker makes the distinct clicking of radio wave interference. Combine that level of detail with the music choices and you're left with a nearly-perfect soundscape that immerses you completely.\n\nVisual and level design is great. As I stated earlier, each episode feels like a distinct piece of the story, even though many of the scenes occur in the same locations. Part of the reason why this is tolerable is because the world is so beautifully decorated. You can make your playthrough last twice as long if you "look" at every object (which cues the narrator to talk briefly about her thoughts on the object).\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a story that has hundreds of distinct branches, pass on this one. But, if you're looking for an incredible story that you get to dictate, I cannot recommend this title enough.","November 2, 2015","true","20.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you're a big fan of Telltale games, Life is Strange is definitely worth checking out. As much as I love Telltale, this game allows the choices we make to actually have an impact on story, which a few of the Telltale games do fall short on. Whether there is alternative endings for the choices we make is still unclear. (I have a feeling there will be but who knows. I do hope there are alternative endings)\n\nThe game feels so cinematic. From the soundtrack, to the way they create each cutscene in the story (the shots/cinematography really make it feel like you're watching a film). The vibe from the game is essentially a highschool indie film. Yes, the characters revolve around teenagers and a bit of highschool drama, but being an adult myself, I don't feel like it takes the appeal away.\n\nEDIT:  I 110% stand by what I say above, and I have to add that the latest episode is amazing. The way the game has allowed us to become a part of the story with the discovery of mysteries is brilliant and we really do feel emotionally involved when everything connects in the end.

It is very similar to the Telltale games, You have choices, and they affect the story and the world around you. but, there is a twist. You can reverse time.\n\nYou play as Max Caulfield, an eighteen year old photography senior who left her mum and dad in Seattle for the little town of Arcadia Bay, where she grew up as a kid. After she watches her childhood friend Chloe Price get shot, Max finds out she can reverse time, and she saves Chloe from dying. Max and Chloe soon find themselves in more and more trouble in Arcadia Bay as they slowly find out the truth behind the disappearence of Chloe's friend, Rachel.\n\nMax starts to have visions of the future, a future doomsday. Max slowly learns that using her powers and changing the past can sometimes lead to a devastating future. and that her actions, will affect everyone's lives, even if it is just a simple choice.\n\nMy Opinon Of The GameThis is one of the best games I have ever played, the story was so rich, I found myself falling in-love with the characters and relating to them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zydrateacademy/recommended/319630/","zydrateacademy","Zydrate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zydrateacademy/","289 products in account","My gaming life began with Unreal and Quake. This popped in my head as "Unreal Engine" popped up while loading the game, and it's a nagging thought I've had in my head while playing this for over an hour.\nWhy is that?\nBecause this is the kind of game I wish I started with in my earlier years of gaming. It's calm, serene, with a few intense moments without being terribly difficult. This is a game with no real wrong answer - just consequences.\n\nI'm not sure if I should warn about spoilers on a game that has only released Episode 1 of 5, but just in case, beware.\n\nI noticed the first part of this game was 5$ and its advertising was interesting. I didn't even look at reviews - I just dropped the five just 'cos.\nAfter a mere 30 minutes of playing, I went and dropped the other 16$ for the Season Pass, which will give you the entire access to the rest of the episodes. I recommend it. But if you can't do it, absolutely buy the first episode.\n\nThis is an experience I've never really had in gaming. See my first paragraph. Even today I tend to gravitate towards Stealthers and Stabbers and Shooters. But the first hour of this game enthralled me.\n\nThe game sets up a beautiful atmosphere for early adulthood and a vague sense of a disastrous storm on the horizon. Actually, the game does this quite literally. You play as Max, an eighteen year old girl that awakes within a strange storm in a dream that feels all too real. She tries to find her way to a Lighthouse and discovers a sort of hurricane that looks supernatural in itself, and she snaps awake in a photography class.\nShe's a student at an academy for the arts, I soon discovered.\n\nAfter a briefly annoying learning curve to figure out how the control works (It lead me to believe I should click and drag my mouse to the item, not the words.)\n\nI was also pleased to discover this is not a mere point-click adventure game. You actually control Max and move around. There's even a few moments throughout the game where timing is actually relevant, and must resort to Max's "power" to fix it.\n\nSpeaking of. Max turns out to have a sort of time-travel ability where she can rewind time and utilize knowledge. I thought this might have been an artistic choice but it seems that this game is full-on supernatural. As far as I can tell, she actually does have this ability.\nI wasn't sure at first and it changed the way I made my decisions, but then I went ahead and threw myself into this "truth".\n\nWhile wandering around the campus (And other environments later on), I found myself very much enjoying clicking the "Look" option at every little thing just to hear Max's take on things. Not all of it I agree with, though I personally found "The Spirits Within" Final Fantasy movie to be... not that bad, if a bit disconnected from FF as a whole.\n\nUltimately I'm enjoying running around and meeting as many characters as I can while listening to its wonderful soundtrack. Thankfully the music is contextual, you only hear it when Max turns on a stereo or puts on her headphones. Otherwise there's a void of music and you just let the atmosphere take you in. You can hear metals clink while walking down the dormitory hallway. You can hear other students yelling at each other at a distance while hearing birds flutter in the trees above. It's quite amazing and brings you in to the world.\n\nDue to some of my research (and the prominence of this character in the Steam screenshots), Chloe will turn out to be a fairly important character.\n\nI practically just met her, she seems to be an old friend of Max's when they were little teenlings, but they've both changed and I'm interested in seeing how they adjust to each other.\n\nEpisode one has been a trip so far and it works as a great cooldown game but has great, intense moments that makes me feel like watching a television series - And I really, really want to see what happens next. That's how you know when a game or show is doing something correctly.","February 9, 2015","true","15.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TapKnock/recommended/319630/","TapKnock","Knock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TapKnock/","175 products in account","I’m absolutely in love with Life is Strange. That status that says “Overwhelmingly Positive” is rightfully earned, and I’ll go into a bit more detail soon. I have a video review about 9 minutes long you can check out if you would actually like to see that, if not I have a written review below the video.\n\nWritten Review Below\n\n(NO SPOILERS)\nhttps://youtu.be/edgnxUWjgrA\n\nYou might already know this, but Life is Strange plays like the recent Telltale games that have been released (i.e The Walking Dead, Wolf Among Us) and basically improves in certain areas. I personally think this floors those games though because in this game your choices actually matter. There is no illusion of choice. There is just choice.\n\nChoice & Consequence\nThe choice and consequence part of the game is very well done in my opinion. They give you plenty of time to think of what you’re going to say, which is a good thing because you know… your choices actually do matter. They also make it very obvious when what you’re about to do is very important. This makes it so that the player isn’t making choices that they weren’t even aware they were making.\n\nCharacters & Story\nBiggest reasons you should get this game. I’ve seen some people confused as to what this part is like, and in all honesty just try to picture reading a choose your own adventure kind of book where there are different paths to take within a given setting. That setting, is a small town named Arcadia Bay. Up front this may look like it’s about high school drama, but it’s really about the entire town and its story through Max Caufield’s eyes. Max is a wonderful character to play as and she can be very relatable at times. Old school girl living in a modern age. Might sound pretentious when put like that but she really is an enjoyable character, she just likes what she likes. The characters you get to interact with are pieced together in a very exceptional way and it’s interesting to talk to every single one of them. This town has a history that you can learn more and more about just through conversations and hints strewn about the environment.\n\n\nSetting\nThe setting is amazing as well. The music, graphical style, everything combined just puts together an amazing aesthetic (even with the more low res textures, which doesn’t matter in my opinion). They took common character archetypes and put them in here, but I don’t think it will be an issue for most people.\n\nEnd\nSo yes, you should definitely buy this game, I’d recommend it over watching a Let’s Play. If you see spoilers but decide you would’ve loved the game, that’s going to be a shame. Life is Strange is the exact kind of game you really wouldn’t  want to be spoiled for you, because it could make it outright unplayable to some people. So I think you should just purchase it when you get the chance.","September 17, 2015","true","25.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TapKnock/recommended/319630/","TapKnock","Knock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TapKnock/","175 products in account","I’m absolutely in love with Life is Strange. That status that says “Overwhelmingly Positive” is rightfully earned, and I’ll go into a bit more detail soon. I have a video review about 9 minutes long you can check out if you would actually like to see that, if not I have a written review below the video.\n\nWritten Review Below\n\n(NO SPOILERS)\nhttps://youtu.be/edgnxUWjgrA\n\nYou might already know this, but Life is Strange plays like the recent Telltale games that have been released (i.e The Walking Dead, Wolf Among Us) and basically improves in certain areas. I personally think this floors those games though because in this game your choices actually matter. There is no illusion of choice. There is just choice.\n\nChoice & Consequence\nThe choice and consequence part of the game is very well done in my opinion. They give you plenty of time to think of what you’re going to say, which is a good thing because you know… your choices actually do matter. They also make it very obvious when what you’re about to do is very important. This makes it so that the player isn’t making choices that they weren’t even aware they were making.\n\nCharacters & Story\nBiggest reasons you should get this game. I’ve seen some people confused as to what this part is like, and in all honesty just try to picture reading a choose your own adventure kind of book where there are different paths to take within a given setting. That setting, is a small town named Arcadia Bay. Up front this may look like it’s about high school drama, but it’s really about the entire town and its story through Max Caufield’s eyes. Max is a wonderful character to play as and she can be very relatable at times. Old school girl living in a modern age. Might sound pretentious when put like that but she really is an enjoyable character, she just likes what she likes. The characters you get to interact with are pieced together in a very exceptional way and it’s interesting to talk to every single one of them. This town has a history that you can learn more and more about just through conversations and hints strewn about the environment.\n\n\nSetting\nThe setting is amazing as well. The music, graphical style, everything combined just puts together an amazing aesthetic (even with the more low res textures, which doesn’t matter in my opinion). They took common character archetypes and put them in here, but I don’t think it will be an issue for most people.\n\nEnd\nSo yes, you should definitely buy this game, I’d recommend it over watching a Let’s Play. If you see spoilers but decide you would’ve loved the game, that’s going to be a shame. Life is Strange is the exact kind of game you really wouldn’t  want to be spoiled for you, because it could make it outright unplayable to some people. So I think you should just purchase it when you get the chance.","September 17, 2015","true","25.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Well, I went into this game with certain expectations, and I was blown away with the characters and story.  It's a rare gem of a game that can get you so emotionally invested in it's characters that you are thrilled and terrified about the final chapter.  Well written with real feeling characters, it may require a box of tissue or two and a few moments where you will need a break to compose yourself.  Can't reccomend this for everyone as it is beyond alot of people's ability to comprehend the deeper story, but if you're mature enough and have a basic understanding of how the world can be from the fringes this is for you.

It hits hard, and if you don't pick the right things you may or may not get the right or wrong answers. It is great, but be careful when choosing because every action has a consequence to it and if you don't be careful it can pretty much make or break you. I have spent the second act in tears and know I just started but so far I love the characters including Max and Chloe <3 but am nervous for how it will go down in the end.

That being said, this game lives up to the hype. My biggest issue is, like other story telling games with many choices, it encourages you to go back and play it again, taking a different path. With a game like The Walking Dead, I found that easy. Even with all the twists and turns, and knowing what was going to happen, I felt like I was able to grind through the game easier, see the endings, and walk away knowing everything about the game.\n\nI don't see that being easy with this game.\n\nWhile I don't think the story is AMAZING like many do, it's much more involving, much more gripping, and much, much, more interesting than The Walking Dead. When you're hit with a twist, you're hit. You feel it. I feel much more connected to these characters, than I did Lee and Clementine. I didn't feel sad at the end of The Walking Dead. It was sad, I knew it was sad, but I didn't feel sad. I do dislike how every character remembers tiny key things you did hours/days ago, like in The Walking Dead, and it effects their disposition towards you, forever.\n\nWhen something major happens in Life Is Strange, I feel much more emotional about it, which is why I feel like playing through it again, will be much harder, and almost boring. It does offer many more outcomes than The Walking Dead, but that's almost an issue. On one hand it may feel like I'm playing a whole different story, but at the same time, the key events are still going to be mostly the same.\n\nI felt the same way after STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl. It was such a good game, that playing it a second time, was boring. The fear of the unknown was replaced with knowing where early guns are, knowing who I could, and should fight, and who I should avoid for a while. Ignorance was replaced with experience, and it made it so I got about 5 hours into my second playthrough, before uninstalling the game.\n\nAll of this being said, the game is so far past worth playing, even if you only get one true playthrough. I've only predicted one key event early, and I wasn't even fully correct on it. You're left in the dark just long enough, that as soon as you think you're figuring things out, the game slaps you, forces you to take a step back, and rethink your last hour of playing.","October 1, 2015","true","15.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It not only has a suspenseful story, which reminded me of the classic Twin Peaks, it has just the right amount of interactive gameplay which similar games from Telltale lack in my opinion. But there's even more to it. The game may contain some stereotype characters and elements of your typical High-School-drama, but it presents them in an authentic way dispite the supernatural story. Life is Strange radiates a wholeheartedness and a down-to-earth mood which I enjoy very much. Max Caulfield's tale is presented in such a believable fashion and with so much attention to the little things which constitute human life, it's enchanting and enables a degree of identification rarely experienced in digital media (ok, The Witcher 3 managed that too). I'm not only looking forward to play future episodes, now I even want to pick up my camera and shot pictures right away. This is the gaming equivalent of contemporary tv-shows.

It is so emotional, impact and it makes you think about it so much after you have finished an episode. After finishing episode 3 I can't think about anything else other than this game and how they will make the next episode. Right now after finishing the existing episodes right now I only have this game in my mind. It was the same for me when I finished The Walking Dead. Emotional, impacting and everything.\n\nIf you like The Walking Dead or any emotional story based game I definitely recommend this game.\n\nJust the fact that when you play these types of games, you get to make your own choices which makes you more interactive with the people in the game. You can choose if you want to side with one person or another based on your opinions. That is one thing that makes these games so emotional that you get to know these characters so well that it almost feels like they are your friends in real life.\n\nI am really looking forward to episode 4 and 5.\n\nEdit:\nI've played Episode 4 and 5 now and it was overwhelming. I just love this game so much and it is really sad that this was the last episode because I really can't get this game out of my mind and I just feel like this is real life friends that you just get seperated from and that makes me feel really sad. But the ending was great and this game will be in my heart forever.\n\n\n11/10 - It is indescribable how amazing this game is.\n\n\nI cried.","July 14, 2015","true","13.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It made me see the impact that decisions i make could have in real life and also it just made me notice a lot more. For instance, in a scene you lose your power at the last second and it was just conversation and no rewind, that was what real life is like, no rewind, you mess up, you messed up. You really start to look out for what you say after playing this game.\nNot many games touched the sentiment i felt while i played the game.\nPlay this game and get your heart torn to shreds too.\n\nAlso, Life is Strange has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.\n\nThank you Everyone at Dontnod.","March 11","true","19.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

The story will make you go through a roller coaster of emotions as it plays out in 5 episodes. Gameplay wise there's not much to it, and it does have it's flaws. The puzzles are pretty interesting when combined with a time travel mechanic, but they aren't too terribly hard. Sometimes you wish it would get out of the way so you can delve deeper into the engrossing story. It plays out like a choose your own adventure game a la The Walking Dead. The choices you make can change how other characters relate to you in the future, but in the grand scheme of things it is pretty inconsequential. There is a leaderboard that compares the choices you've made to others online which is interesting to look at. What LiS does have in spades is a deep and engaging story with superb writing and a cast of memorable characters that you will fall in love with (or hate). As far as this type of game goes it has to be easily one of the best games out there.","October 24, 2015","true","17.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I won't be afraid to admit I've teared up at a good number of movies and books, but there has only been 2 games before now that have ever effected me in that way.  This is not only the 3rd one, but I still have tears as I write this, 34 year old man sobbing at his PC desk.  But you know what I don't care.   This game is completely about immersion, this game is completely about absorbing everything around you. Catching all the details, all the beautiful moments and there are lot of beautiful moments, haunting moments, distubing moments, joyous moments... Getting to know all the people and making you care about them, hate them or love them, some more than others.  Yes this story has a base foundation of teen drama and I like many I imagine do probably let out a few sighs at first..but do not let that stop you, please do not you'll be robbing yourself,  keep going you will not regret it.  This game has taken my emotions to all sorts of places in every which way possible. But in the end I would have to say this is has been one hell of a ride and I have some new favorite video game characters when others think of Link, Solid Snake, Master Chief or Lara Croft,  I will be thinking the likes of Chloe Price and Max Caulfield.  I commend you ‎Dontnod Entertainment you made yourself a fan.","February 16","true","18.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I have played trough all the chapters in offline mode)\n\nTL;DR:  good.\n\nMy actual review This game has impessed me, considering i usually don't like those "interactive movie" type of games.\n\nIt's filled with rememberable characters that feel real and you can make decisions whether to interact and befriend with most of them or not.\nEverything is being told nicely and there was always a moment that surprised me or made me feel emotion.\n\nBut a few times the story suffered from generic american writing.\nSome moments were predictable.\nAlso there's a strange thing that made me care more for a side character(Kate) than for a main character(Chloe).\nI guess her story was more focused on and therefore had been given more cliches.\nBut hell, i don't know, i don't know shät about writing stories, so ...maybe others see it in a different way\n\nThe main mechanic of being able to reverse time to redo your actions, takes away the pressure to make wrong/right decisions (like killing an aggressive man or to talk him out).\nMeaning that you can choose an action and if you don't like what happens after it, you can always go back and thus not having to restart from your last save.\nIt's a fresh concept for this type of game and it's main focus is ,of course, the time travel.\ni won't tell you more about the story since...that's the point of those "games".\n\nI'm not a graphics whöre, but in an interactive movie, this is a big aspect.\nAnd i have to say: it looks nice.\nThere's a blend between "realistic" and "comic" with the realism being a bit more dominant.\nFor some reason, the necks seem a bit too long . but that's nothing that bothered me after i noticed it. (or maybe i'm just a hypocrite on neck lengths.)\nI haven't noticed any texture glitches or anything like that, it looks almost perfect.\nThere are some low res textures that don't fit in but they have always been on unimportant little things.\nThe handdrawn textures (posters, notes,pictures,photos) look...not very detailed but innocent and still nice and fit in.\nAlthough the calm, acoustic guitar soundtrack makes me want to vomit (a personal thing) ,the overall sounddesign is pretty well done.\n\nOverall: i had a blast with this.\nIf you like story based games then Life Is Strange™ will definitely be worth buying.","March 20","true","2.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Dontnod Entertainment, a small developer based in Paris France, has taken the episodic genre to new levels of excellence in story, character development, art style, music and soundtrack, so let me discuss those topics.\n\nStory: Life is Strange is about a girl age 18, Max Caulfield, who wants to study to become a professional photographer. She learns that a school in her hometown, Blackwell Academy, has hired one of her favorite professional photographers Mark Jefferson, and she decides she needs to move back to her hometown to enroll in his classes. That is the normal part about this story and nothing else in the story can be considered "normal" in any way shape or form. Each new episode takes the story in a surprising direction that the player will be astounded by, and never able to predict which way the story will go. This is practically unheard of in game stories because most of them are so predictable and cliche by the time you get to the end of the game you know exactly what will happen. Life is Strange is 100% different in that category.\n\nCharacter development: The main characters in this game are so well done that you will form emotional bonds to them and if something happens to these characters you will feel it as though it is happening to you. Be prepared because you WILL NEED a box of tissues for your tears close by in LiS, and that is a guarantee. Nearly every single person I have conversed with on the Steam forum for LiS has admitted to shedding tears and lots of them, yes the characters and the story are that good rivaling even great best seller novels I have read, and I have read thousands of novels.\n\nArt style: The art style in Life is Strange is not photorealistic like many games now days attempt to achieve instead it is very stylish in the way the Dontnod team has done it and it is perfect for a game like this. Along with the amazing camera work in LiS I think it deserves awards in all three categories I have mentioned so far. All the art in the game is hand drawn and hand painted and it really does show in the finished product, in fact I have a folder on my PC with about 400 screenshots from LiS that I run on a 5 minute timer for my desktop background. I finished playing LiS back in October of 2015 when the final episode released and I STILL have that folder running as my desktop background the art is amazing!\n\nMusic/soundtrack: The music in Life is Strange is modern day artists and one of them Syd Matters, the Dontnod team worked closely with the lead person in that band Jonathan Morali and he adapted some of their songs specifically for LiS. Because they use current artists is adds yet another level of realism to the game because you are hearing songs that young adults age 16 to 25 would be listening to in their every day lives. The music selection also really sets the mood for the game and again it deserves an award for the excellence and quality.\n\nAbout the only thing I would mention as a "con" to Life is Strange is that the lip sync quality is not very good. However in interviews with the Dontnod team they said they spent the games budget in areas they felt would better serve to make the game a work of quality and the story, characters, art style, and soundtrack are so good that you will hardly notice the poor lip sync, at least that was the case for me playing LiS.\n\nIf you are a gamer and you don't have this title in your library you have missed out on the best game of 2015 without a doubt and likely one of the best games of all times, yes it is that good.\n\nEdit: I wrote this review when the game was only at three episodes released and though the 4th episode was as good as the previous three, episode 5 the final was not as good as the rest of the game. Dontnod did not do the endings justice to the story in that there was more then one choice at the end and those choices were not equal in length and quality with one of them being much, much better in length and quality then the other was. Both endings were good however one was shorter and not as good as the other, this made for a lack luster ending for me because I preferred the choice of the shorter ending and I would have liked to have seen it show more then it did.\n\nPlease note that though I thought the ending could have been better it in no way makes Life is Strange a failure or a bad game, in fact it remains my favorite game for the last decade and likely my favorite game of all time.","September 26, 2015","true","204.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

A really, really, fantastic game.\nOne that once played, is very difficult to unassociate yourself with, forget and the like.\nI would even go as far to say, the best choice and consequence game, I have ever played.\n\n+ The moment you step into the life of our young protagonist Max, you should expect to find yourself there for all five episodes, and to find yourself reeling after the reveal.\n\n+ Some seriously deep, thought-inspiring, heart wrenching moments, better described as being 'in abundance,' keep the story-driven experience brightly focused on your subjects.\n\n+ Character depiction is wonderful; detailed, easily relatable, enjoyable unique - I can assure you that you will come to care deeply for all involved, and get your heart broken.\n\nYou WILL be tested over your sense of self-worth, WILL doubt your own decisions, WILL probably cry; as they say, 'with great power, comes great responsibility.'\n\n\nA total of five episodic chapters have been released, each with their own definition of awesome, and all combined, lead to a tense climax. I really hope for more games of a similar format to be released by this developer.\nSincere thought has been put into the making of this one.\n\nI recommend taking your time, and paying specific attention to detail. There are so many hidden gems that even the most discerning player may miss.\n\nI do not recommend reading the store page description - just plunge in head first! Sometimes it is better to view the darkness without a candle.\n\nLife is Strange remains to be my favourite find of 2015.\nHighly, highly recommended to all, there is very little text involved aside from choice-making, so reading should not be too much of an issue.\n\nEspecially recommended to those who enjoy story-driven play, intricate scene details and discovering their meaning, metaphorical narrative, and intense periods of emotion; but as previously mentioned, no matter your preferred genre of game, I highly recommend obtaining this one.\n\nWorth every penny, but purchasing is simple.\nThe real difficulty, is letting go.","February 18","true","27.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"
