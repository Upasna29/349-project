And since most of the time you will die for stupid reason, the absence of checkpoints makes the game even more frustrating then it was before.\n\nThis game is just a mess. I don't see how can somebody save it.\n\nEARLY ACCESS REVIEW:\n\nI wish I could Imagine a better game..\n\nImagine me is just one simple platformer. The concept looks nice I guess, but there aren't any interesting new gameplay elements. This makes the game flat.\n\nThe art style probably is the only good thing from this game. It's not new or mind-blowing, but looks neat at least.\n\nEverything else is a huge mess: the controls are super weird, you never understand when you're gonna jump high or when you're gonna jump IN THE HEIGHT YOU WANT.\nThe levels are super easy. Really, no effort. Looks like a flash game from the early 2000s.\n\n9€ for this is a scam. I only have it 'cause I got a free steam key for it. And I beat all the levels in less than 20 minutes.\nFor now, don't bother spending on it even on a big sale. Wait to see if the game gets any better with the time.\n\nFinal Rating: 3/10\n\nIt has nothing to offer. Literally nothing. Except tons of achievement for just opening the game.","July 2, 2014","false","1.7"," 53 of 59 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","53","59","0","6"

Now it has some badly designed generated levels. I often found myself playing the same level and it gets boring very easily.\nI'd suggest the devs go back to the previous stage of the game and improve it.\n\nPros:+ The Challenge levels are pre-defined and were fun to play; it took me a short while to complete them all, but they weren't that bad;\n\nCons:- Generated repetitive levels, gets boring in a short while;\n-Lacks initiative, there are only 2 types of enemies, 2 types of traps and 1 weapon;\n-Boss levels are random aswell, many people complained that they had to play dozens of stages to finally reach a boss area;\n-More soundtracks were welcome..\n\nConclusion:\nI would recommend Imagine Me only if you really can't afford any other platformer out there. Even then, you would probably put it away soon. The gameplay lacks many features and I see no real reason to replay the game after you have finished it.\n\nPersonal rating: 30/100 - Awful","August 10, 2015","false","1.8"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","27","29","0","0"

It can’t decide where to commit, patching on modes of play like a bad worker trying to explain their way out of a botched job by showing you all the little, trivial tasks they’ve completed instead. Right out of the gate Imagine Me tries its hand at procedurally generated level designs (it can’t be that hard, right? Everyone’s doing it). But once the algorithms start rolling and the levels actually come into existence, it’s immediately clear Imagine Me hasn’t the slightest clue what it’s doing.\n\nChunks of familiar levels become hastily adjoined to one another into an unplayable mess of broken hitboxes and impenetrable block mazes. It’s chaos of the highest degree, silent caverns filled only with the cries of my broken soul as I beat myself against a metaphorical wall trying to beat a game which is quite literally impossible to complete. Somewhere along the development pipeline it must have been clear that something had gone horrible wrong, but rather than rework the disastrous level generator into something functional, Imagine Me instead decides to abandon it altogether and starts building levels by hand (it worked for Mario, didn’t it?).\n\nBut much to my dismay Imagine Me hasn’t much of a knack for level designs, random or otherwise. At numerous points it almost appears as if whoever actually designed these levels fell asleep and never completed them, or otherwise became so bored with their own creation that they decided enough was enough and shipped whatever they had in front of them at the time. And thus we are left with 30 or so astoundingly dull and simplistic levels which play very much like the afterthought they were.\n\nI might feel worse about the depths of Imagine Me’s failure if it didn’t seem so apathetic toward aspiring to even moderate quality (or functionality). Everything feels empty and tedious, leading you in circles until either the game breaks or you stop playing. Imagine Me is sloppy and dysfunctional, but I couldn’t say it seems to actually care.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","December 27, 2015","false","1.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

Controls feel generally bad, since there is a lot of random generation there are some poorly placed blocks (For example, a lock on a wall that leads to nowhere) Also, the campaign doesn't save, so when I Alt+Tabbed, the game crashed and I couldn't be bothered to start again from the beginning. Only 2 kinds of enemies and the boss is incredibly easy.\n\nOn the plus side, the game is an easy 100% if you're an achievement hunter.\n\nSince the dev is working on the game a lot, I hope that I'll be able to switch this to a reccommended eventually, but for now I can't reccommend it.","February 3, 2015","false","1.8"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","3"

Like many people, I got it in a bundle, so no real loss there, but if you are considering paying ten dollars for this, don't.  It's an amazing game for maybe a grade school student to make in their spare time, but has no business asking for money on Steam.  I really don't feel moved to rate games that often, only if I really enjoyed the game, or if it was so bad I feel the need to warn people, as if I'm being thoughtful or noble, but really, I just want help prevent games this bad from making money, so that people stop making games this bad.  Maybe it's hypocritical of me, being one of those people who buy bundles of crap just so my library looks swollen and engorged with gaming goodness, verily dripping fun, but two bucks for ten games at least gives me a fighting chance of finding something cool I never would have seen otherwise, whereas ten bucks for one game with a slew of negative reviews would be madness.

Decided to give this another try now that it's been released and somehow it got worse. The d-pad still doesn't work, which only exacerbates the problems with the new level design. The levels are extremely frustrating with lots of tight death traps to maneuver, and the imprecision of your movement makes this almost impossible. Try to do the same thing and you'll get a different outcome. It's almost like it's a response to the dearth of content in the original Early Access offering, by just stretching out the gameplay. I don't know how much content is there yet, but it's worse than what was there before.\n\nIt's also more about exploring than platforming skill, featuring large levels with items to pick up, but it doesn't really give you much incentive to do so. You can pick up keys to unlock boxes that don't hold anything or get in your way. Arrows can destroy some blocks, but usually you don't need to do that to progress. There's just no point to it, none of the platforming is fun, and I gave up after 20 minutes. I might give it another go later and try to blaze through it and update this review again or even rewrite it entirely, but wow, was not expecting to come away this underwhelmed at the full release. At least the price came down.\n\nOriginal review:This is one Early Access game you should avoid, at least for the time being. The content in the game currently lasts all of 15 minutes, and none of it is any good. There are far better platformers out there with far fewer flaws.\n\nFirst of all, one of my pet peeves surfaces in this game: it doesn't recognize the d-pad. For a platformer that specifically tells you to use a controller every time the game loads, this is borderline unforgivable. The platforming itself feels boring and uninspired, consisting of short levels with not much to do in them. Sometimes the jump decides it isn't going to jump today. The timing on getting a boosted jump from springs feels similarly capricious. The random level generator usually spits out unplayable garbage, and the actually developer-designed levels are so sparse as to barely be worth mentioning. The level select resets to the first level every time instead of automatically moving to the newly unlocked level, which is a minor annoyance.\n\nIn its current state, there is nothing that should compel you to spend $10 on this game. In fact, if you wait you'll actually get a better price, unlike most Early Access games which offer you a discount to encourage you to buy an incomplete product:\n"The price will be lower outside of Early Access. The game is currently priced higher. This is so no one buys the game without reading a little bit about it."\n\nDon't spend money on this game right now, it will be cheaper and hopefully better later.","July 2, 2014","false","1.9"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

I went to look at the controls, and the screen came up behind the level I was on. THIS GAME IS CANCER. DO NOT BUY/PLAY.\n\nEverything about this game screams 'baby's first programming attempt'. The game relies solely on randomly generated levels, which often contain impossible jumps and walled-off spikes, and offers little more gameplay than jumping (of which you can double-jump, but ONLY if you jump first - no fall-jumping) and shooting blocks to get to the end of a map. Enemies are little more than moving dangers - one hit of which will send you back to the beginning. Becareful of projectiles too, as hitting one (which kills you) will cause it to remain floating in the air, making some maps impossible to complete (as the stationary object will still kill you on touch).\n\nI say this not out of spite - I know everybody has to start somewhere - but you can find better games for free on flash sites. Paying for this game would be a waste of any money. I can't remember how this came to be in my library - possibly by a Humble Bundle - but be assured that after this single sitting, I have no reason to ever come back to this poor excuse of a game.\n\nEDIT 1: I finally made it to a level that was literally impossible to reach the end of. Luckily the developer foresaw this and gives you a 'regenerate' button on the menu. Known your generation system is that flaw to put a failsafe in is quite something. Oh, and I hope you like the first three bosses, because you'll be seeing them again.\n\nEDIT 2: Having played two hours and 8 bosses worth of levels, the story (a scentence between levels) just loops, with no ending or purpose. They might as well be blank loading screens, as there is no payoff, no cohesive story, and NO END TO THE GAME. This is nothing but a worseless, waste of time. Yes there are challenge levels, they're nearly impossible to do.\n\nThis game is randomly generated. Infinitely long. Handles like ♥♥♥♥. Campaign is too easy. Challenges are too hard. There are three enemy-types, which all might as well just be moving spikes. I have seen better games for free on Newgrounds, so do yourself a favour and give this a wide berth.","January 8, 2015","false","1.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","1"

That sounds about right. During that 15 minutes I have played through the entirety of the game. I then quit, while scratching my head and asking myself "What am I missing? There has to be something I'm overlooking here." After a little investigating it is clear that I did not miss anything, I really did 100% the game in 15 minutes. About 5 minutes of that time was spent pressing every button and key on my controller and keyboard trying to find hidden options or abilities that will help me beat the 75% of the "generated" levels that are literally unbeatable.\n\nThe game consists of 8 "tutorial" levels that slowly introduce game mechanics of springs, keys, doors, and spikes. You will beat these levels in about 5 minutes if you take your time. After you are done with those, all you are left with is the "generated" levels. 75% of these "generated" levels (which are not actually generated, you will run into the same few levels over and over) are unbeatable due to the positioning of the exit door, and the lack of an actual game mechanic or player ability other than running and jumping. If you are lucky enough to end up in one of the winnable levels, then after you reach the exit door you will be kicked back out to the hub world where you can once again choose to play the tutorials again or another generated level. I have cycled through the generated levels several times, and I only counted 2 of them that are actually winnable.\n\nThe game has no replayability, no interesting mechanics, and no redeeming factors. The sound is fine.\n\nSomething important to note is that despite the Steam Store page for the game saying "Full Controller Support", the game does not use xInput (important to anyone using an Xbox controller or x360ce) and does not allow you to rebind keys. So you'll likely have the jump button be something ridiculous like a shoulder button on your controller.\n\nDon't buy this game for any price in its current state.\n\n5/5","May 14, 2014","false","1.5"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","22","36","0","2"

How hard it is to screw up basic platformer controls? I can't make games but I've managed to get righter controls from doing a tutorial for Game Maker that I never finished becuase I got lost from version differences.\n\nI'll add some reasons why this is bad.\n\nI've played a lot of platformers since the NES days. I love platformers. I'm not sure what this qualifies as. It seems extremely broken. Slightly touch the Right direction and you slide extremely fast to the right...right into a block...which kills you because there is a spike above it. Yes, above it. The hit boxes are so off. You die from spikes when you haven't even come into contact with them. You touch a block that has a spike above it, dead.\n\nSomething seems terribly wrong with the friction settings too. You completely stop moving when you come into contact with a wall. One might try to hide this problem by calling it a wall grab or something similar. A feature? LIsten, I know wall grabs from the many games that pull it off. This is not a wall grab.\n\nDev, if you used Game Maker for this, at least finish the tutorials on how to make a simple platformer.\n\nI really hate to use such harsh judgements on a game, especially early access. But This game does not even seem to have the basic foundational mechanics working enough to be fun. That would seem to me to be much more important that getting a random level generator working, or spooky sound design, or story. Get the dang game working at least up to par with some oldschool Atari titles before passing it along to public.\n\nI will gladly change my opinion of this game if the changes between now and completion are drastic enough in a good way. RIght now they would need to be extremely drastic at best.\n\nI would never discourage one from getting into game dev and creating something fun to play. By all means make it fun. Have fun doing it. But when you get it released on Steam as Early Access for $9.99 in the currect state it is in it kind of feels like a slap in the face. I cannot recommend this unless I was trying to prank someone out of $10. (which I would never do)\n\nP.S. It's really late and I haven't slept in ages. It's possible I'm over reacting and lacking in my ability to filter the harshness. But please put some effort into making this game actually playable and fun.\n\nP.S.S.

All levels fit on one screen, and objects are limited to blocks, spikes, springs, and occasionally a key. Gameplay does not vary at all between levels, and there aren't very many of them. The game also features a random level generator which spits out garbage that often is either impossible, or can be won by running to the right and jumping over one pit. The controls are bad, with it being difficult to guage the time you need to jump to bounce high off a spring, especially after they start sinking into the ground after you bounce on them a few times. The stats are completely broken, with the game awarding my the 50 deaths and 100 deaths achievements the first time I died, and the 1000 deaths achievement a few deaths, and less than a minute later.

The game congratulates you for doing it YOUR way. That mindset belongs in a RPG.\n- Actual level design is not something you'd write home about. And I talking about both the singleplayer and the randomized levels.\n\nDon't buy this game, if I see anything good in the horizon, it's the "Coming Soon" stuff in the store page.

The game in its current state is not worth 9.99 USD in 0.3 hours I completed all the challenge maps and got all the achievements. There are only 8 achievements and I got 2 within the first 30 sec of playing. There is random dungeon mode where as the name says, it will generate a random dungeon but really the game just feels lacking for it to hold your interest. It has potential to be a decent platformer and it is still early access but as it currently stands, the game is not worth the price. I'm only giving a thumbs down due to lack of content, really easy achievements, and the 9.99 price tag.","July 1, 2014","false","0.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

They were far better than this game. My games were simple, yet was fun. This game is boring.\n\nThere's not much of a reason to play this game. This game is too repetitive. The levels are randomized but practically all the same. There's no variety in this game really. Even my first platforming game I had ever made had more than two enemies and they had different qualities. The enemies here poses no threat. If you die, you restart the level. $2.99 is too much to ask. Bad Rats is a much better deal. I actually did have fun with that game. I would had actually spent money on Bad Rats, I would never spend money on this game. I got it for free from...somewhere. I have regrets of getting this for free, but I could sell the card I just got from this game. Yay!\n\nThings I liked:\n-I can make a little profit from that card (you won't get profit if you buy this game. According to Enhanced Steam extension, this game lowest price has been $2.24. Get it only if you can sell the cards for more than you've spent.)\n-One boss somewhat made me startled I guess...\n-The text after every level were somewhat interesting I suppose.\n\nThings I disliked:\n-Everything.\n-There's a dedicated button for showing the controls which looks ugly because it goes behinds the platforms and such. You can't even see it. The controls however, are easy to learn, but not precise at all. I found my character still running even without pressing any buttons. Not too sure what the look button was for either...\n-Two enemies, boring, no threat.\n-Bosses were pretty boring too. Much more improved than the regular enemies, but these bosses can easily become regular enemies.\n-The boxes...I'm not too sure why I can move them when I jump on them.\n-Sometimes I can't double jump. I'm not entirely sure why I can't do it at certain moments but I'm not playing more to figure it out.\n-Repetitive. All levels are basically the same just randomly arranged. (Have yet to see an impossible level.)\n-Nothing really to look at.\n\nOh, I can provide another positive. I can cross this off my "Steam Games in my Library I haven't Yet Played" list.","January 19, 2015","false","0.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

Levels don't even change when you die, the only option is to start the game all over again.\n-the options menu is pretty lousy and cannot even be accessed while in game, instead you just get this really annoying            screen that appears every time you start a new game showing you the pre mapped controls and some instructions on how to play, there's even a special key just to open the instructions again. I dont get it, of all things that are missing, why do the developers want to force this on players, the game couldn't be simpler, children games are harder to understand than this, it serves no purpose.\n\nIf devs were ever involved in Imagine Me they would have fixed some of this problems by now, they seem to take into account everyone's bad feedback and yet no changes have been made. How difficult could it be to generate new levels every time you die just so it was at least possible to continue playing without having to start from the beginning every time you get stuck.\n\nAs is, Imagine Me is not even worth its current price.

A lot of the time, I think that random level generation is more of a lazy excuse to not put time and effort into level design than a way to have the game be "Spontaneous and different every time".  In addition, random generation still has to have some sort of regulation, or your game will end up like this game, where you often find that enemies will block passages with no way to get past them, two locked doors will block your way with only 1 key available to you, and spikes will be placed in areas that make it impossible to progress.  Enemies have much bigger hitboxes than are shown visually, and they often move so slowly that it takes 2 full minutes of waiting before an enemy will get out of the way.

Unfortuantely I don't reccomend this game for a number of reasons, first jumping on springs are super annoying, the only real information you get is to jump at the "perfect time" whenever that is, I just ended up spaming the jump button to get around it but I never had this much trouble trying to jump on any other game. Deaths by spikes seem to be set on both the spike side and its side, so a lot of spike deaths feel wrong? The game is in alpha stage at the time of writing through so its not suprising that bugs exist but considering it retails at $10 USD for me, I could find a lot more better games, much more polished and worth the price in comparison. I also can't really find too much of a hint of a story line, and unless I'm playing the wrong parts (AKA the menu doens't feel too intuitive) it seems to be super short for full price.\n\n\nOn the flip side though it does contain quite nice graphics even through it feels a bit like the green is overused everywhere and it has controller support which is a nice addition. Also considering the game has no story or anything its quite interesting, its not too difficult, but not too easy either, there isn't a long death time so you can get back to playing pretty quick, and I never felt ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, after playing which is always a plus. If you got the game freely or part of a bundle or SUPER cheap then it would probably be worth it.

The gameplay is unpolished, repetitive and feels very dull after a while.\n\nYou spawn in pseudo-randomly generated dungeons where you need to get to the exit while collecting arrows and keys.\nAfter every dungeon, you get 3 or 4 lines of the story, and at the end of a "memory" you fight a boss, the same boss every time. The game doesn't get harder in any appreciable way, and the story gets less interesting as you progress.\n\nThe biggest issue, however, is that the game is VERY unpolished. Enemies' AI keeps running and they retain their hitboxes even during their death animations, the menus are wonky and have incorrect button labels, the death screen feels like something hacked into a game engine that didn't have a feature to add death screens. This game was in Early Access until early December, but it feels no more finished than when I previously played it in June.\n\nIt's only 3€, but it just feels more like an idea someone had and never followed through with, rather than a game, so I really can't recommend.","February 7, 2015","false","2.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","7"

BUT wait there's one good thing about the game!!!  Well two actually.  And since I doubt everyone will read through things I'll put the positives at the top of the review/rant\n.\nThe main screen music is a hauntingly beautiful refain.  And the second good part is that the game is super easy to uninstall from Steam.\n\n-------------And now on to something more appropriate for a bad game------------------------\nSomehow this travesty costs 10 bucks as an early access game in an Alpha build.  Most companies follow the mindset that they'll charge more when they complete the project, which makes me wonder how much they think this pile is worth.  In all honesty I got the game for pennies on the dollar through a indie sale, and my money would have been better served by giving change to a hobo to have him expose himself to unsuspecting women for my amusement.\n\nThe controls are about as loose as a ♥♥♥♥♥ that thinks a baseball bat is just about the right size.\n\nDespite claiming to be randomly generated, all the levels I've played are identical on each playthrough.  Supposedly being fixed, but I for one will never know if that's a true claim since I'm not planning on booting this one up again.\n\nHell the fact that people are posting pictures of them having just completed a level should be a good indication how flawed everything is.\n\nThe hitboxes are odd.  Sometimes they seem to project out futher than the spike itself, not just above but sometimes to the sides as well.","August 21, 2014","false","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Also very very very boring with horribe horrible pace.\nSome of the random levels are unbeatable because you simply cannot get the exit or due to other bugs the path is blocked by standing-still projectiles from earlier failures that were not cleared out.\nThe programmer has no idea of how to work with Unity and it's horrible. For a game that the number of animations and assets can be counted on 3 hands it's stupidly weights 1.3GB. If it was done right it should be 100MB tops if you compare it to Thomas Was Alone.

You see the instructions of how to play at the beginning of every level and not even once it tells you you can dounle jump (which is bugged when intercating with springs) or sometimes you can head stump enemies and won't die (probably a bug).\n\nIf you can get it for like 20 cents or less go for it for card farming and the soundtrack. The game doesn't worth any spare second or cent beyond this. Too bad you have to install this ♥♥♥♥ to get the soundtrack.

It's not good and its not fun.  The listed price is definitely a rip off.\n\n\n-----\n\nSo I have now come back several months later and my opinion of it has actually gone down.  It controls much worse now.  Slides around for no reason, like you are walking on an icy surface.  Sometimes it doesnt jump when I press the button.  The jumping itself feels very imprecise.   Objects in the world, such as spikes, manage to kill you when you arent actually touching them.  I clipped into the ground and was no longer able to move.

The only 3 good things I can tell about it are that it was made with love (but love =/= quality), random generated levels are cool idea and its short soundtrack is really really good.\n\nBut...\nThe story is confusing, when you finish it it just starts from the beginning with no explaintion and no conclusion. Also very very very boring with horribe horrible pace.\nSome of the random levels are unbeatable because you simply cannot get the exit or due to other bugs the path is blocked by standing-still projectiles from earlier failures that were not cleared out.\nThe programmer has no idea of how to work with Unity and it's horrible. For a game that the number of animations and assets can be counted on 3 hands it's stupidly weights 1.3GB. If it was done right it should be 100MB tops if you compare it to Thomas Was Alone. I have no idea how the ♥♥♥♥s it weights so much when there's so little content in this game.\nThe documentation is just super bad. You see the instructions of how to play at the beginning of every level and not even once it tells you you can dounle jump (which is bugged when intercating with springs) or sometimes you can head stump enemies and won't die (probably a bug).\n\nIf you can get it for like 20 cents or less go for it for card farming and the soundtrack. The game doesn't worth any spare second or cent beyond this. Too bad you have to install this ♥♥♥♥ to get the soundtrack. I recommend the developers to learn how to do a properly 2D game in Unity or just to move to Media Fusion Studio or GameMaker.","January 6, 2015","false","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","6"

I tried again, thinking maybe I didn't kill a specific boss to progress, only to find out that one of the bosses is unbeatable.

It's the same for winning a level. You're at the exit, but you get touched, so it doesn't count like a win.\nThe hitbox. It's ♥♥♥♥. There's a spike diagonally to me, if I go too much near the block that should stop you from hitting you, you die. Approching a block near a spike made me paranoid.\n\nThen, the generated levels. They sucks. Most of the time you can't access the exit.\n\nFor the challenge levels, some of them are quite hard, but it's quite repetitive. The difficulty curve is really bad, too.

Complete 3 rooms to face off against a boss, then you repeat to regain more memories.\n\nThe control scheme is pretty much basic, it can be controlled by keyboard and controller, movement is fluid, and combat... well, not much actually. It's optional to defeat the enemies, but at times you'll need to defeat them, which at times will randomly drop a gold arrow bundle, which contains 5 arrows to use to either defeat enemies or break blocks.\n\nThe music fits really well, especially facing off with the Haunted boss, feels like you entered another genre without notice, plus the music intro theme (unsure of who sung it) has a nice feel to the game, in a way.\n\nAll in all, I give the game a 9/10! The game is constantly being updated and has a pretty awesome community. If you're a fan of puzzle platform games, I recommend adding this to your collection. Keep cool, bros!

I've beaten basically all the game content in about 30 mins. But it is enjoyable. The developers are well on there way to a good game here.\n\nUpdate: I see the game has since been lowered to 2.99 for the base price, if you are still only getting what you got when I played the game I wouldn't pay more than a dollar for it, but I'm assuming the developers have added a decent amount of content since I think this review is at least a year old.

Sometimes you need to unlock a door by collecting a key first, and sometimes you traverse portals. Spikes and scowling, flaming enemies are to be avoided. The levels are also sparsely populated with crates, random physics objects for which I could find no real purpose.\n\nAs of this review, this game is a decent foundation for a much better game, but for now, it's only a handful of levels that provide a very low level of challenge. I like the idea of being able to craft levels for others, and being able to find out more about the game's protagonist by collecting snapshots is interesting, but it's all over so soon and you're left wanting more. The current set of "challenge levels" are a little uninspired.\n\nHere's to hoping Imagine Me will grow into something better. For now, only buy if you're really wanting a new, simple platforming experience and you want to support this game before its official release.","June 26, 2014","true","0.2"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

If you played other platformer games you can see that there are ice blocks that you slip on them and you really hate them? So all of the blocks here are like that,\nBecause of that if you use the ramp you will jump and will move really a bit because you didnt gain your speed yet and then you hit the spike and RESTART THE WHOLE LEVEL.\nand some minor things: the "tutorial" is a picture of 5 seconds that you can realize in this time what to do.\nAvoid this game.","August 24, 2014","false","1.2"," 2 of 17 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","2","17","0","1"

The artistic style is actually pretty good. Simplistic and easy to look at. That's about as much good as I can say about the game though.\n\nImmediately after starting the game I was met with a how-to guide for controling my character. This was on screen for about 2 1/2 seconds before going straight into the game. I was met with a tiny area and no way to get out, except for a block that had a lock on it. Obviously I needed a key, but the only one was outside of the little "room" i was stuck in.\n\nAfter a moment of two of extreme confusion, i realized there was a "regen" option in the pause menu. I did that and was able to play the map this time around. Apparently the levels are procedurally generated, and some are nearly impossible.\n\nBut I forged on. Through persistence and several level regen's, I was able to progress through the levels, which sadly all use the same images. The only way to tell the levels apart is by the color scheme used. This goes for the bad guys as well. You just seem to be looping through the same level over and over again with no hint of progression except the little bit of text which reveals some memory about the protagonist. That and every so often you meet a horribly drawn boss with no real gameplay mechanic except "kill this guy, then the main guy".\n\nAfter playing through all the bosses, you simply loop back around and beat the first boss again. No increase in difficulty, and most importantly, no real progression. In fact, even the memories you're reading between levels start looping. It just goes on forever.\n\nI have seen platform games in a browser which have more content and playability. I honestly am suprised that it's considered a full-fledged game. This is the level of game i'd expect out of a 48 hour game-jam. This is what i'd expect from a concept, or pre-alpha stage.","January 7, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are broken, which is kind of an achievement for minimalistic platformer. The music is awful by itself, and it keeps starting over when you take any action in main menu/die/respawn. Randomly generated "dungeons" can contain inescapeable traps, however they are ridiculously easy by themselves. Challenges vary from being stupidly simple to artificially hard (e.g. land in between 2 trampoline blocks connected diagonally). The "story" it offers is a very fresh and original tale of a misantropic schoolboy, which is not even presented in appealing way. The only good thing about this game is a pretty title screen.

It's a really simple, easy to use, child friendly game making tool. It's really simple, free if you want it and is only really capable of making some pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games. It's a good teaching tool and stuff, but I would never expect a decent game to come out of it. This is of course entirely unrelated to this game (I hope), but the games that come preloaded with the scratch application are way better than this game. There's a game where you press keys on a xylophone or something and they make the sounds as if you were playing the zylophone; awful and incredibly boring, but I would rather spend a day playing this game than ten minutes playing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥, unfinished piece of garbage.\n\nLet's talk level design: no. I don't think there is such a thing in this game. It's supposed to be randomly generated and I've seen that work well in some games, but when random means that you can be completely blocked off from even completing a level, I think you've got a problem. There are blocks that can be broken, blocks that cannot be broken, spikes that shoot something, spikes that sit there being spikes, and springs that make you bounce way higher than you would ever need to.These are all poorly used and just kinda frustrate me.\n\nAlright, so how about the general feeling of the game? Well Bob, it's ♥♥♥♥. That's about all. There are no checkpoints, so you'd better not have to leave the game, it's repetitive and not very long, but long enough that I was done after only 5 minutes.\n\nBasically, it's not even nearly finished and my younger sister could create a better game with better functionality in Microsoft Paint.\n\nI have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue how games like this are allowed to be put on steam while so many great games have to be actually greenlit before valve will even think about them. This game is like grabbing a rotten turnip when you were expecting a carrot. You were impartial, but ended up completely disgusted.","December 27, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I guess there are memories you are supposed to try to unlock by descending into randomly generated levels.  The issue is that as the levels progress, there seems to be no increase in difficulty, and the memories you unlock don't seem to be particularly interesting.\n\nI might recommend this game for younger audiences, as an introduction to platforming and puzzle solving (especially since the game is incredibly forgiving - there are no "lives," and any time you die, you immediately respwan), but for anyone looking for a challenge or rewarding experience, look elsewhere.","December 28, 2014","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I find that a lot of things have indeed been overhauled and many improvements have been put in. There is more to the game to be sure and it plays a lot smoother for me.\n\nI can say with all honesty that the Dev took criticisms to heart and really tried with this one. It's simple but challenging. But I will caution you to read the reviews with an open mind before deciding to buy.\n\nAs I mentioned originally it is basic but remember people, this is a small developer. It isn't the next Mario Bros game but it's not crap.\n\nAnyway, the long and the short of it is. You will either like it or not. Just go in eyes open. It has flaws but there is some fun there if you are fond of challenging games.\n\n\n\nOriginal Review.\n\n\nThis is one of those games where early access is a bad thing. Like a lot of others, I received this in a bundle. I've played all of maybe 5 minutes of it and already uninstalling. It's not for me and unless there are major changes involved, it will never be for me.\nThe jumping feels glitchy, the graphics aren't bad but as many have pointed out there is a HUGE problem with the level generation. Without more being added to the moveset then you will find many levels unbeatable.\nNow, that said, I am not bashing these devs or the game itself. In fact I am kind of curious to see what they plan on doing with it, if anything.\n\nAs it stands now though I would not value this game at $9.99 or even $4.99. Stay away until the full game is out. Give it a chance at that time. Should things improve I will gladly look at it again.\n\nJust not that much to be enjoyed in its current state.","May 31, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"
