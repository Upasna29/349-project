Must be because I'm old enough to have seen the evolution of video games. Also, it's an Hidden Object Game, you don't expect to have Call of Duty's most recent engine, do you?\n\nArtifex Mundi as a publisher didn't always have the luck to propose great games. They're ok but not at the level of perfection they can present (Time Mysteries, Grim Legends). But this one? I really enjoyed it as it's one of the rarest where the French translation is nearly perfect! Apart for one object, the rest was smooth (I don't count the fact that they managed to translate Dr Gordon Child, which is a name, into Dr Gordon's child).\n\nThe storyline is really captivating as you're sent to a strange island, with ghosts and with a sad story. It's up to you to defeat the evil power-hungry man.\n\nThe hidden objects games aren't hard and the puzzles are the standard ones if I can say it like that.\n\nThe landscapes are beautiful and the idea to film real people is very very good. The fact that you're mainly seeing the eyes of the inhabitants is also strenghtening the mystery around. The only problem is when Dr Child is speaking: lips aren't synchronized to the English voice acting. And the finale was kinda anti-climatic.\n\nThe soundtrack is again perfect for the game.\n\nNo, really, this game is really really one of the tops they've published without being the developers. But it will never top Grim Legends or Nightmares from the Deep or 9 Clues 2: The Ward. Anyway, it's always a pleasure to play a good HOG.","October 6, 2015","true","4.7"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

This time the base price was even increased by 2 €/$ which makes it even worse. Mixing real 'actors' with not very well painted backgrounds is used instead of the usual animated characters. Let's say that it doesn't work too well and the fact that the 'actors' don't talk at all (they don't move their lips...) makes it borderline hilarious. The story tries to be mysterious, but it only comes across as amateurish. The musical score is fine, but that's pretty much the only redeeming quality of this game. The item based puzzles are confusing as you often have to return to locations you didn't visit for a longer time just to use one item to get another one.\n\nNot a good game at all and asking for a higher than usual price leaves a bad after taste.","September 26, 2015","false","9.0"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","24","34","3","0"

While it is not the pinnacle of the Artifex Mundi collection, I found it to be very entertaining and worth a couple hours of gameplay.  As I almost always say, I suggest getting it on sale, as I believe personally that most of these HO games are overpriced for the gametime involved.\n\nThere are certainly some odd things in the game.  Cutscenes are live-action/"acted" rather than animated and I'm not a personal fan of this style, especially as they come off like a bad foreign movie dub (lips are moving but the words aren't matching).  That said, I've also seen far worse.  The voice acting is extremely sub-par in my estimation (I've seen some varying opinions on this so your mileage may vary); everyone sounded pretty much the same and interestingly, in the credits, there is but one male and one female voice actor listed.  I have no problem with double-use (or more) of voice actors if they're able to effectively change their voices, but that's not the case here and it made me a little twitchy.\n\nThe gameplay itself, however, is just fine.  It is a pretty standard HO/pointy-clicky sort of game, typical Artifex Mundi style, with the normal mix of minigames and HO scenes, none of which were horribly difficult but they weren't pushovers either.  I didn't feel the graphics were poor at all, but I'm also not picky, having seen some of the worst of the worst over the years.\n\nThere was one bug that's been mentioned where a cutscene will occasionally not happen and prevent the game from progressing.  This did happen to me, and I did have to start over, but it's relatively close to the beginning of the game and I wasn't really bothered by the ten minutes it took to redo that early bit.\n\nSo my final recommedation is that it's worth a playthrough if gotten on sale and if things like bad voice acting and weird cutscenes aren't going to upset you.  If you're going into it without expecting something incredible, you shouldn't be too disappointed.  I, personally, am not going to have any problem replaying to clean up the last of the achievements.","September 30, 2015","true","7.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Still, the unengaging storyline, questionable acting performance, and the lack of challenge won’t rank it high in the Artifex Mundi portfolio.\n\nLong version:Dark Heritage: Guardians of Hope feels like wasted potential: it looks good and the individual parts are working, but the end product is just not engaging at all.\n\nThe story about chasing around some Dark Master on a derelict island in hopes of preventing him from getting a powerful artefact isn’t bad on its own, but it just cannot build a good atmosphere—in large parts due to the inclusion of live actors who do nothing but stare emotionlessly into the camera.\n\nOn the technical side, it looks good, and that’s about it. Game time is spent mostly with backtracking, as the entire area is open from the start, and it is easy to forget some arbitrary item from the beginning a dozen screens later. The hidden object scenes and the puzzles exist, but neither offer any challenge whatsoever. I wouldn’t say the game is tiresome though, it’s just almost insultingly easy.","May 19","true","4.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

It's intresting to mix live actors with the game, but almost all animations are bad, FMV and background looks incredibly different to the point of immersion breaking (whatever little immersion one had), and the actors are so bad that dialogue scenes with them were filmed from about 15-20cm distance, only showing half of their face, which is in turn totally emotionless. The quality of voice recording was worse I usually experience talking through Teamspeak, which is quite an achievement.\nThe  game is filled with reused items (the same hanging rope strands appeared on at least three different locations out of 5 scenes at the start), and there's a known gamebreaking bug that's likely present from the start (game release: 2015, 24th of Sep, discussion about bug started on 26th) and it haven't been addressed, responded or fixed. You can find the topic here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/394280/discussions/0/523898291500798356/. (edit: playing the game with two profiles - first one was okay, second got halted because of the bug)\nThe game is not bad as a hidden object game, but because of the obviously ignored problems and shaky quality I can't recommend it at all. If you can get it in a bundle it's okay, but buying it from Steam store ( 10€ base price while much, much worse than the cheaper, Mundi-done games) is absolutely not recommended.\n____________________________________\n\nEdit as finally finished the game:\nThe bug of bird not appearing seemingly only appears if you use fast-travel to the fisherman's hut after mining the crystal in the mine - you need to go back, and not use the map for it.\nThe other 3/4 part of the game sadly pretty much like the first quarter - hidden object scenes are nice (Except one when you need to find two different kind of handles, one at first, and one at second time. That's just confusing).\nQuality of cutscenes are the same, taken from really close, and really intrestingly they are both overacted and without proper emotions - the villain of story for example had totally no lipsync at all, it was really weird. Maybe the game was originally made on a different language, I don't know - considering this as an option, all the items and descriptions have proper english, to say something positive.","March 23","false","9.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","3"

HDO games are really hard to get good (graphics, sounds, story) and they try to give their best but no one can believe that they could to reinvent the wheel or to revolution the Hidden Object Games. So if you want compare it with other  Artifex Mundi  they cant hold it. Sure the developers of 9 Clues make 2 hits but maybe have a bigger team, more team members, higher budget, who knows so i dont want to match anyone. The story is sufficient, because HDO main thing is to find hidden objects and this screens are fine, the puzzles are satisfying, you see some of them in other games but they are not 100 % the same. So i had my fun, there are some problems but give the studios trust and support and hopefully they give it back in some years. I give 67 % personally and trust them that there games get better with the time if enough players support them and dont judge this early game to hard. Its not so easy to develope HDO and not easier to develop good HDOs.

Good music and atmosphere, and I actually prefer this type of supernatural horror theme for HOGs, as it makes me more tolerant of weird adventure game logic.\n\nThe hidden object scenes are fairly short, and you don't return to the same scenes so much that it becomes repetitive. Graphics are nice, and I don't recall any issues with the English translation or wrong object names, so getting the "all hidden object scenes without a hint" achievement wasn't too difficult.\n\nThe live action cutscenes could be effective if used in small pieces and better integrated into the overall graphical style, but for some reason the camera lingers on the actors' blank expressions, which kind of ruins the immersion. The final villain speech is laughably bad just for the contents, but the awful live action cutscene used there might push it into "so cheesy it's good" territory.\n\nDespite that issue, I found it an enjoyable game. Definitely recommended for HO fans.","March 12","true","4.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

He wants her to come to his city office so he can explain the details.  When she arrives, his office is in shambles and he has disappeared.  She travels (or is summoned) to the island where she discovers an immense tradegy; the inhabitants are dead and the fortunate ones have fled/escaped from the destructive and homicidal evil new master of the island who is searching for the Philosopher's Stone to gain its power.  While searching for her mentor, Gordon Child, our heroine, meets and helps various lost souls bound there, who in turn call her their "savior" and the "chosen one".  (And just to be perfectly clear, this game does NOT smack of any religious connotations, beyond good vs. evil.)\n\nAbout reviews:  I decided to add this bit about reviews here after reading other reviews AFTER I played the game and wrote my own review.  1) Most reviews complain about the graphics claiming they are old.  Fine they are not exquisite pieces of art but they are highly detailed and crisp, and in many ways fitting with this supernatural and quite possibly "not in this world" island.  The artwork is consistent and stylized.  2) The cutscenes are a lot of the game, and live actors play a role in both the cutscenes and as the lost souls in the game.  One thing all the reviews seem to have missed is the heroine is "reading their mind/ emotions" with the medallion and the people are dead meaning they basically lack the outward emotion of the living.  So the live actors do not need to speak or even be lip synched properly.  I personally found the disconnect, disconcerting and baffling, and intentionally or not in my opinion it added to the surrealism and other worldly flavor (like a reminder almost) the heroine was from a different world (quite possibly literally).\n\nGameplay: On expert mode there are no sparkles (which in this case look like runic symbols which move sideways) and that alone makes finding the hidden object scenes, puzzles, and needed inventory items tough.  The cursor does change from an arrow to a round glass circle with a tail, but if the gamer lacks the patience to thoroughly "explore" each scene do not play on expert mode the first time.  This game requires some intuitive and a bit deductive reasoning to play.  For instance, when confronted with a half finished ladder, it is obvious the ladder needs planks for steps, nails, and a hammer.  What is not so clear is where to obtain all those items, a shed, a tool box, floating in water, against the building, laying on the ground.  This too is part of the challenge of the game, knowing what one needs, finding it somewhere on the island, and then obtaining the item once it is found.  Fortunately there is a fast travel map though it is not really needed.\n\nThe game more or less plays in a linear fashion, completing the scenerio of freeing a trapped soul before being able to move on to the next one.  There are four souls in all that need "saving".   So with the introduction, and conclusion that makes six separate but interrelated "chapters".  Plus there is a bonus chapter.\n\nThe hidden object scenes are fair, nothing outrageously hidden, but one is required to look closely for some of the finds. (One reveiwer vehemently complained about the finds stating the find clue could be several things.  This is true.  For instance, handle could an axe handle, a shovel handle, or a machine handle.  However with a bit of deductive reasoning ... say there is a shovel blade in your inventory most likely the shovel handle is what the find clue is referring to, if not click on all the handles until the correct one is found.  Simple enough.)  There are fragmented or "hidden" objects to locate which are colored in the clue list.  I do like when a clue find is found it turns red-black then dissovles into smoke.  I think it adds to whole evil/supernatural motif and different from the usual disappearing find clues.  Each hidden object scene plays twice (some possibly more) so remember where they are (especially on expert mode).  Some are played once early in the game then again much later in the game.  The same is true with some of needed inventory items, one finds the item early but may not need it or be able to get it until late in the game.\n\nThere is a variety of puzzles in this games: sliders, matching, logic, codes, rotating (the bonus chapter one is very difficult).  For the puzzles I highly recommend reading the diary.  In this game, the diary is the most helpful clue giver found in the game, and often is where the clue needed is found.  The dairy also relates the scenerio objective to the storyline, sometimes adding information to the pages after the initial reading.\n\nThere is one extra find in this game: the scrolls.  I doubt they are missable since they are obtained during game play and the entire storyline is crytically given through the visual cutscenes when the scroll is read.  Two special achievements I would like to note here are 1) watching the cutscenes and 2) examine all the notes, maps, scraps of paper.  Both are easily obtainable if one does not skip the cutscenes and actually clicks on the notes, maps, scraps of paper to read them.  I actually recommend clicking on the notes, maps, and scraps of paper because they often end up in the dairy, and once on the dairy pages often gain extra information.\n\nOverall the game is a fair challenge on expert mode and relatively hard on casual mode depending on the gamer's experience level.","October 4, 2015","true","8.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Except less fun, because there are important puzzle objects near exit points and the corner of the UI, hidden objects in the corners near the UI or 80% obscured by things in front of them, objects being repeated in thesame scene (Leading to "Oh, we don't want you to click *THIS* wheel), worse than usual "Nope, you can't use this on this axe on those planks, because the planks have bolts on.

The graphics are decent, though not spectacular and there's a good balance between puzzle and hidden object mini-games.  One thing that I didn't really like though is that at times puzzles needed to be solved without the knowledge that the object could be interacted with.  Typical Artifex Mundi games will show you all interactive objects in a scene when you slide your mouse over it, but this time there were a few instances where I randomly clicked on the screen to find the answer.  Other than that, the game plays well, no bugs, and easy achievements.

This is a game PUBLISHED by Artifex Mundi but NOT made by them!\n\nWhile this doesn't make the game bad it does mean that you shouldn't go into this expecting AM goodness. The game is a solid bit of fun for fans of hidden item games. It has a consistent story, good hidden item scenes and plenty of mini games, it's also voice acted but the main character does not get this treatment. If you're not a fan of live action cut scenes, though, you may find this game annoying.\n\nYou play a bright student on a mission to rescue her mentor who, in the process, gets dragged into also helping an island and finding the Philosopher's Stone. The story gets a bit out there as you play and the characters you run into are down right weird but you have a solid mission to focus on and the game challenges you to get there. Every hidden item scene is well done artistically and in terms of making you look well for the items. Some of the mini games are very frustrating to me but not impossible to solve.\n\nGraphics are alright, not bad but not amazing but overall perfectly find for this sort of game. The live action cut scenes, however, were not to my liking. They seemed very out of place, honky and far too many up close shots of the actors' eyes. I took a screen shot each time they focused in on someone's eyes and they're all disturbing. It doesn't make the game unplayable but it does take you out of the moment each time. Thankfully the music helps keep the mood going.\n\nI recommend this game, perhaps during a sale. It's a good game, not great, but an enjoyable play through. It also has achievements and Steam cards as well so for those of you out there addicted to collecting will also enjoy it!\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","November 1, 2015","true","5.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

For one, it's a game full of glitches and crashes constantly. As if glitches weren't enough by themselves, crashing can cause glitch in your gameplay. In turn, you must restart the entire gameplay(not just reboot) to complete it.\n\nThe real actors themselves were an interesting addition to the game, but the lack of expressions in the actors did not support the feel of the story in game which in turn only made it redundant and draggy to watch. Acting for the cutscenes were barely mediocre. However, the blending of real actors into the game scenes were fine, even if every single one of them suffered from dementia and that my arrival to the island became their panacea.\n\nThe story puzzles me, greatly. For one, it is not attention grabbing and I soon find myself losing interest of the story, only to advance through the game for the standard hidden object game mechanics. I frequently find myself lost in the attempt to understand the story as certain events that teaches you about the story triggers at an awkward time that made no sense and confused me. Sure, they all fall into place once you reach the end. The flow of events are there to guide but hardly concrete enough to form a good story. It simply feels like a mish-mash of words and pictures then characters to guide you through disorganized story sketches and the usual puzzles available in these games.\n\nOn sale, in bundles, maybe I'd recommend. Full price? Hardly. It's a half-solid game for hidden object lovers, and a decent one at least. Only half-solid because I'll never get over my frustration on the amount of crashes and bugs this game has that were not fixed nor addressed by the developer or publisher. So no, I'd not recommend it.","January 9","false","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's not necessarily bad, but it isn't exactly good, either.\n\nFirst of all, this is not a $10 game, so do yourself a favor and stay away unless it's on sale. I personally got this in part of a Artifex Mundi (the developer) bundle, so I don't have an issue with pulling 5 hours for pocket change, but there is no way I'd tell anyone to spend full price on this.\n\nThat said, let's talk about the game itself. "Meh," seems like a good place to begin. More importantly, I did enjoy playing the game.\n\nDark Heritage combines the challenges of Myst with the fun of an I Spy book. If that sounds underwhelming to you, then I'd probably walk away right now, because what you see is what you get. The art's neat, and the puzzles are interesting. Unfortunately I found most of the hidden object challenges to be a little easier than I would have liked.\n\nThe gameplay was enjoyable. The story, on the other hand, was just painful. The plot of this game is probably one of the worst I've ever heard in my life - it's confusing and poorly written, the voice acting is garbage, the video actors are laughable, and the ending made me smack my head so hard I saw stars.\n\nTL;DR: All in all, Dark Heritage isn't anything special, but it's still entertaining if you're into casual puzzle games. The achievements are easy to unlock, the art is pleasant, and if you opt to wait for a sale, I expect you'll feel like you got your money's worth.","March 2","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You unfortunately have to start the game anew should this happen to you :( Also edited a lot of the review due to what in hindsight seemed like an overly harsh tone! Now past the bug I can give the game a fairer review, apologies!\nI saw this game go up in advance of release and was actually really excited about a new HOG (I probably have a slight obsession). It looked great in the screenshots but unfortunately even having passed a bad bug (see blow) I still don't recommend the game unless it were on sale due to other issues.\n\n+++++\nVoice acting is pretty good, this can be hit and miss in the HOG genre. I found the non-moving lips a bit odd but it doesn't particularly put me off in a hidden object game.\nTwo difficulty modes, essentially casual and expert. Hints recharge very quickly on casual difficulty.\nThe game comes with achievements for those looking for a swift 100%, also cards.\nAs you progress through the game the puzzles maintain a steady difficulty. There's a good number of puzzles too, it doesn't feel rammed with them. A couple of the puzzles felt quite fresh whereas some felt repetitive, but none too difficult. It's balanced well with hidden object scenes.\n\n+-+-+-+\nA neutral point would be the cut scene graphics. In the trailer they look pretty good, both cut scene and in game, but for some reason the game doesn't like my resolution (1920x1080) and it makes the graphics look poorer than they probably do for other sizes.\nI thought the music was a highlight of this game which was marred by poor audio mixing. There are choppy gaps between tracks and some of the ambient noises sound as if they're a different quality to others. I play with headphones so it might not be as noticeable on speakers. Still a shame though, loved the music.\n--------\nIn a few ways this game reminded me of those ported over from handheld devices. The tutorial arrows are a bit of a distance off what they're meant to be pointing at but this had me wondering if the problem was my resolution. The UI is also a bit of a pain in this way as you can find yourself accidentally nudging the return at the bottom of the screen trying to pick something up.\nI thought the map feature was one of the things that really let the game down. Some people prefer playing without using the map and that's fine, but as this game makes you go back and forth quite a lot it's a very useful feature and keeps the game moving along at a good pace. The map in this game has locations that are general, meaning you click on 'Harbour' and it'll take you to a crossroads between other places. I suppose having the feature at all is better than not having it but it just felt a bit of a let down that was compounded by other problems.\n**Why I do not recommend this game**: Eventually you will find a bird, help it, and it flies off saying it'll help you out. When you get to a certain point in the game where this bird is meant to appear, it just decides not to for some people. I spent way too long combing over every inch of every screen and could not find ANYTHING to progress the story. I'd had a fish rock in my inventory since I started nearly 2 hours ago but the bird can't sort itself out? Lazy :P Anyhow, as a result of this bug, I couldn't progress any further until replaying the game. It may take varying amounts of time to get back to that point but it still seems like a big oversight.\nThis game is newly released, going by the Steam store page. The graphics just seem a bit washed out and dated. Again I worry that this is my monitor but other players have also noticed it in their reviews.\nThe plot is there, but that's about it unfortunately. It serves as a good backbone to the puzzle part of the story but other than that it just kind of follows you about as you play.","September 30, 2015","false","4.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

I, a self-declared completionist, actually uninstalled it about 1/3rd of the way through because I just couldn't take it. Here's the breakdown:\n+ Graphics: I'm not sure what everyone's complaining about. The graphics are actually pretty high quality. The cut scenes with video are not really my taste, but they're well integrated otherwise. Nothing to compain about here. That is, however, where the positive aspects end.\n\n- Music: repetitive. Sooooo repetitive.\n- HO scenes & games: either entirely too easy or way too complicated. Example: so if I have a crowbar, a hammer and a knife, I have to use the *knife* to get a boulder out of the hole in a tree? And break off the blade while doing it? Really?? And I need piece A to open a box to find piece B which opens another box to find piece C which completes a puzzle that I have to shift three pieces in to solve? Really??\n- Story: The story is completely contrived and ridiculously cheesy (some strange cult on an island, a kidnapped professor), but somehow I'm not allowed to actually work towards the cult and the professor plotline because I absolutely *have* to help every NPC I meet along the way. Because reasons. Plus laughable, pseudo-cryptic, pseudo-esoteric mumbo jumbo from a talking red-winged blackbird with an incongruously gravelly voice. No real plotline to make it exciting or make me want to play, plus weird, ridiculous, pseudo-creepy stuff (I can see the developers now with a storyboard: "Creepy things: spooky castle high on a geologically-improbable spire of rock, cemetary, tomb, abandoned mine, random skeleton in the ferry office"). I wish I could say the kitsch was amusing, but it's not.\n- Price: Dude, I can get 10 beers at the late night store for that and have more hours of fun than I did with this game. Hurrah for Steam sales.\n\nConstructive conclusion: I'm a big fan of HOGA games, and of Artifex Mundi. Try one of their in-house titles instead. I recommend the Enigmatis series highly.","March 1","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't know what to do next and hints weren't helping. Thankfully (or not) other people on steam forums had had this problem and I knew what to watch out for when I restarted.\n\nThe way the story of Dark Heritage is presented is not enthralling nor exciting. I feel like they had good concepts (using real people in the cutscenes so they could convey emotion on a low budget, the society of the people on the island) but the execution...isn't there. I'm having trouble recalling what the island's backstory was because the game just wasn't very memorable. The game is about talking to lost souls so you can find elemental rocks with which to unlock a mythical magic stone! It should feel more mystic, especially because Artifex Mundi has a good reputation for conveying atmosphere. But this game wasn't developed by them.\n\nThe puzzles were often annoying. the two most memorable types were one where you press a button, or lever or what have you, and it affects other levers in the same row and you have to get them all into position, and one where you rotate rings of a circle so they align. While I'm not fond of the first type, I did them all on luck and didn't have a problem with them. The circle puzzles were worse. Often, I was feeling like the way for them to align was just a bit out of reach, thinking I was missing something. I think I used hints to get through one of them after minutes of frustrated sliding, and the solution was to slide them in a bit out of sync but enough that they aligned to the outer rim of the circle. All this did was make me feel like a fool for trying to find a perfect alignment. Another one of these puzzles (one in the bonus adventure) I skipped because the pattern was too same-looking and after many hopeful attempts I wasn't getting a solution.\n\nHidden object locations didn't take into account if you'd already found objects there, so while the list of things to find was new, the things you'd found previously were put back. This is a minor nitpick but it's important. Part or the satisfaction of playing a HOG is the feeling of "cleaning up" a scene; there is then more satisfaction when one goes back and has to "clean up" a scene further with a new list of things they probably remember seeing on their first time. If you go back to a scene and all those things are put back however, it's like what you did previously didn't matter, completing games doesn't matter, nothing in your life matters because you're making no impact on world. I'm exagerrating a bit, but you see my point, yes?\n\nAlso, the lipsync was off on both the only speaking human (an actor) and the bird (animated).\n\nI don't hate this game though.","December 30, 2015","false","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not buggy, and it works, and you'll get a handful of hours of fun out of it.\n\nHowever... it's one of the lowest-rent Artifex Mundi games.  There are few hidden object scenes, and the puzzles are very easy.  There are live action cut scenes likely filmed with non-English speaking actors, so their lips often don't synch with the dialogue, and most of the time they just sit there while the dialogue is spoken without even moving their mouths.  There's also a high propensity for the live-action cutscenes to go into extreme close-ups on their eyes.  Probably a tactic to solve the language issue, but it ends up being as bad as holding on a silent, non-speaking actor during dialogue.  None of this effects gameplay, it creates for an odd, amateurish feel.\n\nThe game is also thin all around.  Not many collectibles (except for a few scrolls) or achievements, and no alternatives to the hidden object scenes as with many of the Artifex Mundi games.  The game is rather short, and the story is inconsequential and nebulous.  In fact, after playing the game, I'd be hard pressed to even explain the story.  Not developed by Artifex Mundi, and one of the worst they've published... but no bugs and fine for those with low expectations who just want a competent HOG fix.\n\n5/10","November 1, 2015","false","5.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
