The player usually takes control of an aircraft (or spacecraft) to do this, and today, we define this sub-genre as the "Schmup" (shoot-em-up).  These games were such a staple of gaming's earlier developments that you can see thier DNA now infused with many modern games.  The problem is that the more pure form of vertical and horizontal scrolling shooters doesn't seem to surface very often anymore.  The more recent release of Radiant Silvergun in the x-box live marketplace makes up for some of this, but the modern shoot-em up world is still barren!\n\nEnter Velocity Ultra-- possibly the most clever evolution of the classic shooter genre, since Ikaruga.  This game takes the conventional shoot-em-up, adds an excellent teleportation system, throws you into it's more than fifty mini-playgrounds,\nand challenges you to adapt to them while meeting certain requirements.  Those that find an affinity with this game, as I have, won't be able to stop until they've gotten a gold medal in every stage.\n\nThe graphics are more than adequate, and have a consistent style to them that doesn't confuse the eyes or get in the way of the gameplay mechanic.  The comic-like art in between missions is fun to look at, and serves as a throwback to the "barely-there" style of storytelling that most shoot-em-ups adhere to.  Why tease the player with too much story when all that'll be needed is very twitchy hands?  The comic-frames more than suffice.  Music is above average techno (I understand that electronic music consists of multiple sub-generes, but "techno" seems to fit the profile here), and carries the game's pace nicely.  Controls are fluid and responsive, with only the occasional failed teleportation to make the player question his or her controller.  And even then, practice makes perfect is the bread & butter of this game, and evidences it's tight gameplay.  I'm curious as to how the controls feel in the Vita original, and I'm even more curious to see how curve studios might integrate the teleportation controls in to IOS, or other mobile devices.\n\nBuy this game.  It's an evolution of one of the most classic genres of video gaming, and it does what it does very well.  The price is certainly right, and we need to encourage more development of games in this genre!  Oh, and did I mention the game has a built in calculator, as well as the game Mine-sweeper?  Does this enhance the experience?  No!  Is it awesome?  Yes!\n\n9.1 / 10","December 12, 2013","true","1.6"," 84 of 103 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","84","103","0","3"

The controls take some time to get used, and it's a bit hard to master at the start, but with some practice you'll do well. It's important to say that this is not a bullet hell title.

Teleporting gives you a nice method of advanced movement, and in many stages a mechanic for puzzle-solving. The controls are easy to understand, but take a while to master.\n\nReplayability: Even after beating the game, you will probably revisit levels to achieve the level-specific milestones for time spent, survivors rescued and score (possibly all in the same run, to get a "Perfect" stamp). Getting all that usually takes about 15h to 20h.\n\nPresentation: Unfortunately the game falls short in this category. The visuals are simple but at least for me get the job done, and the music isn't exactly bad, but gets annoying over time. I mute the in-game music and set my own playlist.\n\nConclusion: It's a very underrated gem, and deserves your time for bringing fresh ideas to the genre, while providing precise and rewarding gameplay.","March 17, 2015","true","12.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/244890/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Velocity Ultra is a cool shoot 'em up, where you can complete most of the levels at your own pace. You can scroll through the levels at a faster pace with the press of a button. Your ship can also teleport and hit walls without taking damage. It's an impressive spaceship, really. There are many levels, about 50 or so, and completing a level will earn you xp; xp that can be used to progress through these many levels as some of more difficult ones will still be locked at the beginning. And it's not just about navigating levels, you also have to shoot enemies (with upgradeable weapons later on) and collect escape pods. Collecting and shooting these will help you earn a bronze, silver or gold medal and these are tied to your xp. I should've mentioned that a tiny bit earlier maybe, but what the hell. Anyhoo, to make a long story short, or a short story shorter; it's an amusing game with, for me personally, not enough content to keep me coming back for more. Then again, it's a shoot 'em up and I've rarely seen one with tons of content. Still, entertaining. Certainly not bad.\n\n[Rating: 73/100]","December 26, 2013","true","2.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

The folks over at Futurlab have tried to innovate on this style of game with much success. It stays true to the roots of a Shmup while experimenting with things such as acceleration and teleportation.\n\nNow while these innovations change how the game plays, it doesn't mean it'll suit everyone. Personally I suffer from motion sickness in some games, games such as Battlefield and Hotline Miami are prime examples, with either narrow FOV or with large amounts of moving elements. Velocity Ultra suffers from the latter, with the addition of acceleration you'll be jumping between snail crawling speeds to being able to do the Kessel Run in under 12 parsecs. This is worsened by the quite zoomed in nature of the game and how you're encouraged to use your blink ability ASAP which causes you to move to the top of the screen, only seconds later being forced to draw back, these jumps up and down across the screen are the main offenders to motion sickness. Narrow game sections are a similar affair, with sometimes 70%+ of the screen being covered in repeating tilesets.\n\nNow if you're not a panzy like myself and can actually play more than 5 minutes without having to take a break you'll love this game, and I can say that to people who may not even be Shmup fans. It innovates enough that it can appeal to a large audience while still being a Shmup at its core with hundreds of enemies, online leaderboards and multiple weapon types. It features a great soundtrack and the cutscene art is a favourite of mine, the style it's done in is breathtaking using a small palette of green, blue and red with thick outlines is a sight for sore eyes.\n\nThe game controls well and supports keyboard + gamepad, runs at 60FPS which is always nice to see. Options while somewhat limited should not be an issue as this game seems to run well on nearly every setup. Only major complaint would be the lack of audio sliders and maybe an ability to zoom out further (though that could make certain teleportation segments slightly easier).\n\nCheck this game out it's worth the money, has lots of cool interesting things which I haven't seen in a Shmup. It's just a shame that this will be a game I won't be able to fully enjoy because of the constant acceleration and teleportation.","December 17, 2013","true","1.9"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","23","35","0","1"

You need to clear every levels and save the survivors, but for that, you'll have to use teleporters, dive ability, booster and or course : shooting.\n\nThe game is in 2D but that's fine, it's beautiful, and smooth. The difficulty increases for every zone you'll unlock.\n\nThis is like a race game mixed with Ikaruga and Portal. There is leaderboard and high replayability to gain every possible gold medals.

Different stages alternate their focus between puzzles, speedy navigating, and shooting/dodging, so there's a nice feeling of variety.  The shooting is pretty forgiving (your ship can take multiple hits) so extreme shmup skills aren't required.

The concept is simple: save all survivors, take out threats, and complete each stage as fast as possible. The twist to this game is that you have to teleport from area to area in order to complete these tasks. Where many shmup's difficulty stems from bullet hell, Velocity®Ultra's challenge comes from fast pace manuvering. The game's fluid and tight mechanics are its stong point. However, this is what will make or break you during your play. In other words, it's a perfectionist type of game. Learning how to navigate/teleport as quickly as possible while rescuing all survivors as quickly as possible is a rewarding challenge. Visually, its easy on the eyes. It boasts a cartoonish art style which is a nice touch, offering a different atmosphere than most shmups. However, It can be somewhat repetetive. Each of it's 40+ stages is just a slight variation over the others. Then again, for the under 5 bucks I payed for it, I can't complain. I think there's a lot of potential this title and I look forward to any future installments.","June 8, 2014","true","17.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Unfortunately, like all puzzle shmups (excluding a particularly awesome boss sequence in Shikigami no Shiro II), the shmupping(?) falls a bit flat.  Ikaruga fares a bit better in this regard with the awesome boss battles but Ikaruga not only sucks as a shmup (enemies never aim at you, they just spray patterns, everything is pre-set and once you get the hang of it every game will be the exact same) but it sucks as a bland match-three puzzler.  If you want a good shmup I would generally avoid Steam because even the ones with more praise such as Jamestown are not that good (fine, if you really want one maybe try Ether Vapor Re-master) so graduate to the Sega Saturn or at least download a good version of Shmupmame.  Now, it may sound like I'm bashing the game, but in reality I'm just very long-winded; the puzzle half of this game rocks!  The levels are tight and well thought out, the controls respond perfectly, and there are various techniques to master if you want to improve your time and score throughout all 50 levels.  The shmup aspect does fit in such a way that it makes what are already complicated puzzles more stressful and constrained adding to the challenge.  There are neat frames shown before missions giving you the gist of what is occurring in the level and the music is your standard techno affair but done better than most.  My two largest complaints so far are that the leader-board scores seem broken (or I'm just the worst player ever) and the screen tears at the top quite frequently.  I'm only eleven levels in and those eleven levels did not take me very long but the difficulty is starting to ramp up to a point that I'm being genuinely challenged which, for being only a fifth of the way in, is awesome and leads me to believe that there should be some decent longevity to the game, especially for its genre.  I'd recommend this game to fans of puzzle games who shmup in their spare time and recommend people that do not fit this niche to watch some game-play videos and wait for more qualified reviews from anywhere that is not IGN.","December 12, 2013","true","1.4"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","12","24","0","0"

Throwing powerful bombs in every direction is as easy as flicking the right stick, yet the less-powerful main guns have their place. Every stage in Velocity is designed like a puzzle, with switches to hit in a certain order, enemies to kill, and civilian pods to rescue. A single miss-placed bomb can reset the switches, while the main guns take far more shots to activate a switch.\n\nSwitches and shmups wouldn't seem fun on paper, but Velocity includes a teleportation feature that makes missing a switch far less punishing than it would be otherwise. In certain levels, you can place a limited number of checkpoints to allow you to hop between switches with ease. The teleportation isn't limited to the checkpoints, however, as you are also free to teleport into any open space you can see.\n\nThe combination of the shooting, switches, and teleportation with a screen that constantly scrolls upwards (you're always forced to go forwards, so without the teleport you could never move back) seems overwhelming. However, Velocity does a very good job with pacing. As someone who is usually terrible at these kinds of games, I was surprised how quickly and easily I got into the game. I'll probably never get a handle on all the systems in play, but I'm definitely having fun.\n\nI only have two issues with the game. First, manually teleporting around the map feels extremely clunky, and I've died several times from the cursor refusing to recognize a space as empty. Second, levels are gated by XP, so if your not good at these kinds of games you may find yourself forced to replay levels in order to progress.\n\nOverall a good game.

So it's a game of agility and hands' coordination, surely it demands much training. However the world of the game is far from adorable and it suits mostly the fans of the genre.\n\nХорошая, качественно сделанная расстреляйка с важной особенностью - есть непреодолимые стены, за которые можно только телепортироваться при помощи перетягивания мыши с зажатой правой кнопкой. Таким образом, это игра на ловкость и координацию работы рук, требующая серьезной тренировки. Мир ее, однако, в себя не влюбляет, поэтому подходит лишь фанатам жанра.","August 8, 2015","false","9.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Still i am a huge fan of scroll shooters and tried it out.\n\nIn Velocity Ultra you try to rescue as many survivors as possible and finish the level as fast as you can to gain the maximum score.\n\nWhile this is a different approach to the scroll shooter genre than the usual "kill everything", it doesnt seem to work very well. Even though all levels are different, they just feel the same, as all you do is collecting rescue pods that are hard to reach.\n\nThe fights feel really bad, as the opponets ships are all looking the same, are not animated and just feel wrong. They die in one shot and even though you get special weapons, its no difference as they are not fighting back. As the screenshots tell, this changes at some point, but the game was so boring that i couldnt make it to those levels without falling asleep.\n\nThe only challenge in this game comes from the high speed and the locations of the rescue pods that need to be collected.\nA game that is about getting the best time and score, should offer scoreboards and allow the player to compete for the best time. However, in velocity ultra there is simply a maximum score you can get which totally desotroys the competition.\n\n\nI recommend watching a couple of videos before hitting the "buy" button, as this is not the typical scroll shooter. As a huge fan of scroll shooters, I did not like this game at all.","August 9, 2014","false","0.5"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","8","21","0","0"
