At the time I had been bugging the ♥♥♥♥ out of my parents to buy me Battlefield 1942 and I was damn sure that that is what my 'special' gift was.\n\nI could barely sleep the night before knowing that Im going to be playing BF1942. The day comes and when I vehemently tore the wrapping paper apart, Battlefield 1942 was not to be seen. In its place I see 'Syberia'...\n\nWhat the f*** is this? Syberia?....by Benoit Sokal? ..Is this a book or something?\n\nShe told me that she heard I liked computer games so she bought me that before coming to America. I thanked her but deep inside an unearthly rage started to boil. I didn't even play it for a couple days because of how disappointed I was.\n\nIt wasn't until I had to stay home from school because of a really bad flu that I installed it and gave it a bash.\n\nThe story, the animations, graphics, art, and theme instantly grabbed me. The sound design was the first thing I noticed when I became instantly immersed with the pattering of rain on the window pane and the soles of your shoes walking along hardwood floors of the inn.\n\nThe puzzles arn't that complex but really solidify the theme of automatons and cogs and gears of machines. I'm currently playing through it again and its such a nostalgia trip which makes it hard to recommend since I already knew what I was getting into. However, I have no problems saying this is my favorite point and click and one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nMake yourself some tea, wrap yourself in a warm blanket and enjoy every moment of this atmospheric masterpiece.","April 27, 2015","true","2.2"," 91 of 93 people (98%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","98","91","93","13","2"

Good mixture of steampunk, naive fantasy and dream, and old fashioned road movie-adventure.\nThe story in the games are about characters and their dreams, not about some complicated twists, violence, or conspiracies. Very touching stuff. Great example of a videogame story, that can be catchy and compelling, while having no violence whatsoever!\n\nYet, there is some rather big technical annoyances in the games. The biggest being the movement animations of the main character...she is just so damn slow! For that reason, I recommend the games just to be played with a walkthrough next to you, to be used whenever you are uncertain what to do next. The puzzles arent that hard, but the walking speed of the char is really that irritating, that you dont want to waste your time watching her crawl from area and back while solving the puzzles. ^^\nAll bad things said; story, characters, atmosphere and music make these 2 games a memorable experience, even 10+ years after their initial release.","November 3, 2014","true","10.5"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/recommended/46500/","talgaby","talgaby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/","334 products in account","Short version: 83%Syberia is a slow, melancholic adventure game, where the somewhat dreamy atmosphere and the large playable areas, combined the wonderful writing and charm, can easily enchant anyone.\n\nLong version:Clockworks and mammoths: interesting combination for any story. Thanks to Benoît Sokal though, Syberia managed to build a touching, emotional tale around this pairing, then wrapped it into a classic style point ‘n’ click adventure game.\n\nLike most stories about old people chasing their old dreams, it is quite melancholic, but never too sentimental. There are no boring tales from a bygone era. Quite the opposite: in this game, we control an energetic New York lawyer, Kate Walker, who involuntarily ends up in an adventure from the French Alps to the heart of Russia, chasing the long-lost heir of a toy factory, so he can sign some sales contracts. Along the way, we learn a lot about this mysterious person and his life, and also meet some odd, but strangely memorable characters.\nThese people, like the whole setting, feel like as if they are stuck a century ago with their old clothes and the early 20th century buildings they live in. This anachronism works in the game’s favour, letting the player get immersed in the atmosphere and the slow-moving, yet great storyline.\n\nA warning though: when I said the story is slow, I meant it. If you want a game where there is always something going on, then Syberia won’t be for you. It is slow even for an adventure game. Not to mention that all main areas are built from several dozens of screens, of which many serve only transitional purposes. They help a lot with building a believable world, but they also wreak havoc with any kind of pacing.\nStill, Syberia offer a chance at a journey nobody will regret. Or, more precisely, the first leg of a memorable journey that is continued in the wonderful sequel…","January 11","true","5.9"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","5"

The tale weaves several themes into its fabric, touching upon everything from the tumultuous changes throughout 20th century Europe to the march of time and technology, the increasing pace of life, what matters, what captures us, and in the end, what truly defines us.\n\nFor negatives, I don't have many other than noticing a few deviations between script and text, as well as a curious bits where accent/native tounge of the character was completely at odds with the words that were actually being spoken. Not a big deal, and easy enough to overlook.\n\nTo add: I didn't have technical issues with the game myself, other than the odd graphic bug, and then only when alt-tabbed; easily removed when clicking thru to the next screen.","August 31, 2014","true","9.8"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","0"

He manages to create a believable steampunk-esq world of automatons and clockwork mechanisms against a backdrop of the real world. When this story is combined with the game's utterly beautiful environments and wonderfully haunting music, it has the ability to take you into another world. The animations are also worth a mention being very fluid and life-like. The animators' attention to detail is very clear to see.\n\nI did have a few minor annoyances such as pixel hunting, the voice acting, while being decent enough, wasn't that great all round and the French to English translation wasn't quite 100%, but they are not enough to detract from what is an otherwise excellent point and click adventure.\n\nIf you are a fan of point and click adventures then look no further.

What will detract your attention is the poor voice acting from Americans attempting to be Eastern Europeans. Never in my life have I heard such distinct New York accents pass off as what I presume to be Russian, but the accents weren't Russian at all, just American.\n\nAnyway, you play as Kate Walker, a lawyer sent in from NYC to some European town to secure a buy-out from a toy factory. Problem is, one of the heirs of the owning family is still alive so Kate Walker has to journey in this strange land of robot-like manufacturing (Automatons) and find Hans Voralburg. There's a mystery surrounding this man as he was presumed dead many years ago. And on your way to meet Hans, you discover secrets, make friends with a robot (Automaton) named Oscar and ride an awesome train.\n\nThe game is a point and click adventure, so don't expect any difficulty besides using logic and common sense when grabbing clues to progress and make machines work; I guess they could be called puzzles. I have to say that the graphics are mostly impressive; I wish the resolution could be changed from....I think it was 800x600. The only other thing that bothered me with the graphics was Kate Walker's running animation. It's obviosly a cycle, but her head bobs extensively from side to side instead of bobbing up and down slightly; being an animator myself I found that was just a bit annoying. I also didn't like the subplot of getting cell phone calls every now and then from Kate's fiance and mother and employer. The dialog from them was frustratingly bad and the whole thing with them felt unnecessary.\n\nOverall, pretty good game. 8/10","October 18, 2014","true","10.9"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atebash/recommended/46500/","atebash","Atebash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atebash/","1019 products in account","I was about to write a review then I remembered I alredy did. Back in 2002. So here it is, unedited:\n\nGames such as this one bring smile to my face. Why? Because I was initially an adventure game player and the last few years have been quite bad for this genre. Ever since Sierra and LucasArts stopped their production of adventures and turned over to the more profitable games, a few developers have even tried to do something. The only true masterpiece that I can think of at the moment is Funcom’s The Longest Journey, while Dreamcatcher’s creations were far from what we really need (still, my congratulations to Dreamcatcher for even trying where others don’t bother at all!). I doubt the situation will get any better soon, but Syberia might prove that there’s a lot that adventures can provide, especially to young gamers.\n\nIn this 3rd person adventure you play a role of Kate Walker, a young lawyer from New York who was sent to Valadilene, a little town in France to complete the deal of purchasing a local toy factory for a huge multinational company. Unfortunately, the owner of the factory Anna Voralberg has just passed away and her only heir, her brother Hans is nowhere to be found. This is where your adventure begins.\n\nThe story might not sound like it’s anything special, but it’s actually amazing! As you do your research to find Hans, you will discover a lot about the Voralberg family, their toy factory and Hans’ maniacal obsession with automatons and mammoths. You will even meet a few automatons made by Hans, robots with their own character! Your journey will also take you to the weird university in Barrockstadt in Germany where you’ll meet more weird people, then to Russian mining city ruled by a lunatic and so on. Everywhere you go you will get into a bit abnormal situations but you’ll get used to it.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the puzzles are rather easy and each problem can be solved in a real short time. Still, since there are many locations and a lot of puzzles you won’t notice this often. I got stuck in only two occasions and both times it really was my fault – once I had to use a cell phone and the other time I just didn’t see the closet that contained two important items. Also, there is no item combination at all, making everything a lot easier as well.\n\nNow I must mention the visuals of Syberia. The graphics are simply amazing! It’s obvious that a lot of effort was put into the visual side of this great game. A few screens of the game exist only to show the beautiful scenery such as the side view of the Barrockstadt University or the resort hotel in Russia. The same applies to the sound as the game features some fine, classical tunes specific to the region in which you are at the moment. I especially liked the music in Russia, which sounded a lot like the old Soviet anthem. The complete game is voice covered and the voice acting is probably the best I’ve heard lately!\n\nOverall, Syberia may be a bit easy for the experienced players but it’s a true masterpiece in the genre. I was delighted to see normal controls unlike in a lot of similar games that I had a chance to play in the last 15 months or so. It’s all point&click, like in good old times. Syberia is a well-made game, with an intriguing story and even a little soap opera that goes on over Kate’s cell phone. I can’t give it a score larger than 82% due to easy puzzles, but … good work by Microids, I am hoping to see more of their work soon!\n\nPlus: Magnificent graphics and sound, intriguing story, easy controls.\nMinus: Easy puzzles, some pixel hunting.","January 15, 2015","true","20.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","2"

Only the resolution is\nlow because of the graphics and computer design of 2002. Even if you had\na good or normal graphic card you would run the game great but still there\nyou listened many cases to have Riva TNT or Voodoo and such graphic cards.\nBenoit Sokal wanted to distribute a game that everyone could run without\ncaring for hardware and so even you had a better graphic card you didn't\nhave the option for better graphics.

The game is very well done with beautiful pre-rendered scenarios, although at low resolution due to being an old game. Although they are very detailed, there is little interactivity, limited to objects and places related to puzzles. The soundtrack is also great.\n\nThe puzzles (simple and sometimes makes little sense), can be a bit difficult to solve for some people as there are no direct explanation or tips on how to solve them (feature that hardcore players will love!).\n\nIf you are a fan of adventures, this game is a must-have in your collection (including its sequence Syberia 2)!\n\n9,5/10\n\n\nAnálise em português:\n\nUm dos melhores 'adventures' que já joguei! Possui uma história interessante que consegue prender sua atenção e o faz querer saber o que irá acontecer a seguir, mesmo o game tendo uma progressão um pouco lenta.\n\nOs personagens são bem interessantes e possuem uma ótima dublagem.

With skippable dialog in case you are in a hurry.\n\nTo get the game running in 4:3 aspect ratio\nI first had trouble getting the game to launch with the old school 4:3 aspect ratio.

But that's a minor gripe.\n-Game ends somewhat abruptly. It caught me off guard.\n\nSyberia is a really great game and I would recommend it to anyone. I would grab it if it's on sale. $10 regular price is a little steep.\n\n8.5/10\n","October 11, 2014","true","17.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Nowadays it looks and feels dated. That being said, if you have an opportunity and like point and click adventure games then definitely carve out some time for this one.\n\nThis game, unfortunately, falls short in a few key areas. The writing is weak, the characters are not terribly complex, and it is rife with clumsy dialogue. Our hero, Kate Walker, is pushed around by an uncaring boss with unrealistic expectations, a fiancé who is the biggest jerk in the whole world who cares absolutely nothing for the needs of Kate and her own ambitions in life, and a "best friend" who thinks she should just stop all this 'having a job' stuff and get back to being a 'good wife' to Dan the previously mentioned fiancé.\n\nThe interactions with these shallow one dimensional characters is punctuated by phone calls in which the writers try to draw out a character arc with Kate that literally has one of them saying, "Wow Kate, you've changed so much in the past few days." Perhaps this passed for decent writing in the past, but nowadays it just seems rough and juvenile as if the writers had no idea how to write a strong female character.\n\nThere are moments in which I found myself rooting on Kate as she told off Dan, solved puzzles, and bested the very jerks she had been placed in this world with but all in all I began to dread the phone calls, the interactions and the conversations with other characters. The puzzles were the biggest relief from that.\n\nUnfortunately some of the puzzles suffered from hints that were too vague and ground the game to a standstill without referring to a walkthrough. Thankfully these were few and far between and in general the game had fantastic puzzles that were challenging and intuitive while being fulfilling.\n\nUltimately, this game does what point and click adventure games do well: provide a story to generate a plot driven reason to solve puzzles. I just wish the story weren't so aggravating, the characters so thin, and the conversations so utterly long winded.\n\nOverall 6/10","February 28, 2015","true","15.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kell_Pro/recommended/46500/","Kell_Pro","Kell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kell_Pro/","184 products in account","Syberia review\n\nThe Good: Breathtaking graphics and music, enriching storyline.\nThe Bad: Quality of voice acting varies greatly.\n\n\nI've never played a game quite like Syberia before. It is an adventure in the most traditional of fashions but yet at the same time it is very unique.\n\nThis game is all about the story. Story and character. You play as Kate Walker, a lawyer dispatched from New York to the strange, automaton filled Alpine village of Valadeline. You are there to settle an inheritance matter on behalf of your firm involving the Voralberg family. Sounds like a simple premise for an adventure game doesn't it? And it is. The story unfolds at a decidedly slow pace. It takes its time and doesn't rush. It crafts this otherwise simple story into a richly detailed experience. In fact, the story is so elegantly and subtly told that you feel as though you are reading poetry or being sung a sonnet that has been transformed into a game.\n\nAn area of the game that goes hand in hand with storytelling is character development and Syberia excels here. At the start of the game I didn't care much for Kate; I felt very indifferent towards her, in fact. Though as the game progressed she became more and more likable and a noticeable change in her occurred. By the end I was completely invested in everything that she did and ended up caring for her very much. This is a testament to the excellent job they did in crafting the story.\n\nThe game play is very similar to The Longest Journey. In fact if you enjoyed The Longest Journey, you are bound to love this game as well. It is played from the 3rd person perspective with 3D characters imposed over 2D backgrounds. The interface is completely point-and-click and relies heavily on the use of inventory items. Nearly all of the puzzles are inventory-based and they are well integrated into the story. I never got a feeling of detachment from the game while solving a puzzle because I knew it was being used to further the storytelling. I felt that the difficulty of the puzzles was very well balanced. There is nothing impossibly difficult that will throw off new players to the genre but simple puzzles are also generally few and far between. Most of the puzzles occupy a nice middleground that should satisfy both experienced and novice players.\n\nBeautiful? Stunning? Breathtaking? All words that can safely be used when describing Syberia's graphics. The level of detail is simply immense. You visit four locations in the game and each has it's own style or theme. Valadeline has the look and feel of an Alpinian village that is hidden away from the rest of the world. Barrockstadt is of a tropical persuasion mixed with modern architecture. Komkolzgrad is a Mecca of machinations and steam. Aralbad has a very Dr. Zhivago feel; an ice covered land with an essence of romance and nostalgia. All are beautiful to behold. What is even better is that the cut scenes lose none of that graphical beauty. They were created with the same painstaking detail that the in-game graphics were. They add incredibly to the cinematic feel of the game; they are even presented in widescreen format.\n\nThe icing on this delicious cake is the music. The score was composed by Nick Valey and Dmitri Bodiansky and they have done an amazing job. It is a traditional classical score that could easily have its place in a film. The score also contains a theme that once heard is easily recognizable, just as one can recognize the Gabriel Knight or King's Quest themes.\n\nSo is there anything that is NOT good about this game? Well, yes. These points are relatively minor but they are still flaws. First is the voice acting. At times it is acceptable and in some cases very well done. At other times it is downright bad. It fluctuates from bad to good throughout the whole of the game. Second would be the scripting. It feels off sometimes. Perhaps something was lost between the translation from French to English but something seems wrong with the dialogue here and there and it is hard to put your finger on exactly what it is.\n\nWith those minor quibbles aside though, this is a thoroughly enjoyable game. You feel transported, engrossed, enriched and amazed all at once while playing. Although the game takes place in modern Europe, you feel as if you are in a completely different world. A world that is isolated and untouched by our culture. It is this that lends so heavily to the nostalgic, sentimental and somewhat sorrowful feeling that eminates from the game. If Syberia were a book it would be the kind you read while curled up next to a blazing fire while drinking a cup of hot chocolate.\n\nSyberia deserves to be in every gamers' collection, adventure or otherwise.","April 2","true","6.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

This game did not brought anything new to genre, there is no challenging puzzles, but still, this is one of the best games in this niche.\n\nKate Walker, a young lawyer from the United States, arrives in tiny european town to sign a contract with owners of old toy factory. At first this journey looks like a routine job, but it quickly turns into long, difficult and amazingly interesting adventure.\n\nGame is very beautiful. Art style is fantastic, every screen is well created with a lot of attention for small details. Also, there is excellent, slightly melancholic soundtrack, that fits perfectly for the mood of the game.\n\nStoryline is well designed, characters are charismatic and it was especially interesting for me to observe how gradually changes the personality of Kate Walker. With time she realizes that money and career is not the most important thing in life, there is something else... something important and special. From my point of view, Kate Walker is attractive and interesting character, she got true individuality. Ending of the first part is one of the most touching scenes i had ever seen in games. I took a tissue.\n\nPuzzles are logical, they fit well in the story, i did not noticed anything annoying or non-logical. Puzzles are interesting enough but not difficult or challenging and maybe it is for the best, so they do not distract player from the story.\n\nCan i give a little criticism to this game? Well... i did not like the animation of characters. Kate Walker looks good enough, but other characters move as dummies. It looks especially ugly if compare animation of characters with stunningly beautiful suroundings.\n\nSometimes there is a little too much of old cliche. Crossing the border between Europe and Russia looks like expedition into depths of Mordor. And when it comes for Russia there is always "slums, bums and drunkards" and other "winter-vodka-bear" stuff. Well...\n\n...nevermind, i just can not criticise this game.

The original Syberia is one of my favourite games and one of the best point and click games I ever played (11/10).\n\nI was delighted when Syberia was published on Steam with OS X port. I bought it, but not downloaded at once. But when I finally did it, I was shocked after pressing "Play" button. The original, beautiful menu was completely crushed with Comic Sans (I'm not kidding) and by changing background from solid assets to animation of Valadilene's factory. It looks like crap, really. But it's not all - i played it for 10 seconds and quit the game, when I saw... hints. Without option to disable them. The in-game interface is also changed; dialogues are viewed in some awful "windowy" thing, and the inventory window is the original one, but streched like hell. Besides - there's no Polish interface; I even changed Steam's main language. That's not a problem for me to understand it in English, but I am very sentimental about Syberia's polish localization.\n\nThis release of Syberia is a total disgrace for the original one. No Polish language is probably a disadvantage only for me, but ruined interface and hints will break the game for every Syberia fan. My advice? Go to GOG's store and buy original Syberia release there. There's no OS X version, but you get original release of the game, not this mumbo-jumbo "HD" turbo Comic Sans remix. It wasn't even mentioned on the Steam page of the game that it is "remastered". Don't waste money on that one. It's not worth a single penny.","December 14, 2014","false","0.1"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","15","23","0","0"

Although the theme of the story doesn't seem special at all, but designers must be complimented for building a haunting gameplay upon it. Elements of longing, mysticism, fantasy, and mystery are well-blended, and make you want to play further and further. Dialogues are well-written and entertaining. Visuals are nothing special. While playing it on a 24" 1080p monitor wasn't a great experience--the blurry edges around all objects were quite visible, they didn't impede my enjoyment in any sense. Puzzles are quite straight-forward, and don't require any critical thinking skills on your part; you just have to be alert to your surroundings at all times. If there's an object or character that you can interact with, be assured it has some use in the game.\n\nThe only major irritant in the game is its tedious gameplay. Your character will need to walk around a lot in order to figure out the problems and proceed further in the game. All that could've been bypassed by making the character appear at the location of interest with a single click. But no, the designers make you watch the character walk all the way to the desired location, which will make you impatient; you might even turn-off the game in anger--only to return a few hours later :).\n\nSCORE: 7/10 (3 points deducted for tedious gameplay, average visuals, and unintelligent game design)\n\nPS: To finish the story, you will need to play this game along with Syberia II.","October 16, 2014","true","14.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The storyline is rich and the characters are dynamic. For a 2002 pc game, the graphics are lovely.\n\nThis is a point and click,  single player game. The interface is incredibly simple, as was to be expected. The game is played in different locations and is not open world (you cannot travel at will between game locations once the tasks have been completed there). Dialogue can be very interesting and entertaining at times, at other times it feels rushed or incomplete.\n\nDon't overthink- some puzzles and tasks are so simple, you can end up making them more difficult than they are in actuality. Yes, some of the grammar and vocabulary is incorrect and the mechanical aspects of the game don't quite add up sometimes.\n\nThe game is full of whimsy and charm, and as it progresses, Kate's character really starts to come through. She is not the adventuresome type.... or is she? The beauty of watching Kate discover who she really is, made for a great game. Two thumbs up.","February 29","true","11.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The puzzles are logical, but also not challenging. The main flaw is the very slow pace of the game and the lack of any way to speed up the main characters movement. Only play if you have a lot of patience.\n\nLong Story: This recommendation comes with a very big caveat. Syberia is an old-school point and click adventure with none of the modernizations that make those games easier to play. No fast-travel at all (not even dubble-clicking to immediately change scene), no way to see interactionable items except hovering over them or indicating which paths you can take. Steam says it took me about 10 hours to finish Syberia, but I would estimate that maybe 1½ hour was spent on puzzles, another 1½h on dialogue and the other 7 hours were spent on watching the main character run around or climb stairs. There are a lot of stairs in Syberia and you will climb them all. There are also a lot of travel frames that you have to get through to get to places with interactable items. They look very nice, but it is still a bit of wasted time.\n\nThis means that you should only play Syberia if you have a lot of patience for the incredibly slow pace of the game. If you have the patience, the game rewards you with very nice set-pieces, good dialogue and a nice story. You play as Kate Walker, american lawyer, sent to finalize the sale of a toy factory, only to find the owner dead of old age and the heir missing in the far north of Siberia. Walker starts off as a somewhat unlikable character (lowest point is probably asking a handicapped kid to pick up an oar for her because it is wet and icky), but has a chance to grow throughout the game by overcoming problems and meeting weird people.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly logical. The difficulty lies more in spotting items and finding all locations that are available. As soon as you have the items and know which locations are available, it is very easy to know what to do. So if you're looking for a challenge then Syberia is not the game for you.\n\nI am recommending Syberia because I liked the story, the settings and the characters. However, it would be a far superior game with the ability to quickly move from scene to scene and some indication of which paths are available. As it is, it is an incredibly slow game that you need a lot of patience to play.","November 15, 2014","true","10.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Gameplay is of the bad old school adventure game variety, there are no failstates, but a good chunk of the puzzles just feel like tedious busywork, and the game loves its back and forth backtracking, and the areas can be kind of big, so I would suggest playing with a guide to save any frustration, also double-clicking to run is your friend. What really makes the game though it is its atmosphere and its thematic focus.\n\nSyberia has a really strong atmosphere, one of mystery, adventure, and wonder but as well as death, decay, lost hopes and forgotten dreams. Kate Walker’s journey to find Hans Voralberg takes her through several fictional European locations, all decaying into obscurity due to greed, selfish ambition, or just the ravages of time. The game is still beautiful even to this day and the locations just really get across the themes very well. The game also does a good job illustrating and building up Hans as a character and the creations he left in his wake in his decades long travel and how his wonder and creativity endured as the areas around him died or grew more cynical. Kate also has a nice character arc and that’s one of the main focuses of the game alongside Hans, and while it’s subtle as a brick at times, it still feels like a fulfilling journey.\n\nWhile there is Syberia 2, I have no desire in ever playing it because everything I seen of it is worse than its predecessor in every way, and it ruins the mysteries of the first game. I feel Syberia never needed a sequel at all because I think its ending is fulfilling enough, there are many mysteries still unanswered but I don’t think they ever needed to be, because as I said who Hans was and what Kate becomes were always the real focus of the game and the game ties those up with a nice bow. Overall Syberia is a flawed and aged game, but one with genuine heart that makes it worth playing.","January 2","true","0.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Despite these aesthetics, the artwork and camera angles were brilliant!\n\nThe story has meaning and messages of all sorts; from the impact of major wars on small European towns (the guard not seeing the static enemy correctly for decades which reminded me of the cold war as a whole), to how mechanical toys seem to be a thing of the past due to the times ('smart' robots replacing machines, smartphones, etc. in our parallel), to uncovering the mystery of a pre-ice age peoples who have been misrepresented by history. (The parallel of history not always being truthful or correct and the shifting of science based on proper connection).\n\nEven the main character's personal debacles seem to connect in so many ways to the story.\n\nIt's been a pleasure playing, and at the same time difficult and rewarding to break out of my ADD shell that seems to be the core mindset that haunts so many top tier games nowadays.\n\nYou really get a good sense of the ‘general’ video game timeline that seems to sway with culture and society every year: this one showing the mindset of well over a decade ago. But this is not to say that it will be as black and white as comparing the first video game ever created to the last, but it is a vibe that's most felt through the medium of a solid interactive experience that withstands time...unless all you wish to do in the video gaming world is to level up and play the same player vs. player maps over and over again, then I would recommend it even more so that maybe a sense of understanding can come about!\n\nBut that's just me :D\n","January 20, 2014","true","12.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

From the very start players are thrust into a world similar to ours but not quite the same. As you explore the world and meet new characters more of the world slowly opens up, but more questions then arise. Syberia isn't what I would call a "point and click thriller" like the later Telltale games such as the Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us. You don't kill anyone, rather there is very little violence at all compared to modern games. However that is what makes Syberia so special in this day and age. Syberia is somehow able to create a compelling world to explore with memorable characters without the use of hollywood-esque explosions or special effects. Kate Walker's adventure eventually turns into not just a simple business trip but a journey in search of her true self. The way this game presents the transformation of Kate Walker from a somewhat naive by the books girl to a strong independent woman is far more believable than Tomb Raider where Lara Croft suddenly transforms from innocent to murder machine within a few hours. Syberia presents the player with a mature story without the ludonarrative dissonance of today's big budget titles.\n\nThe actual gameplay is what you would expect from a traditional point and click, find items in your imventory for later use in a puzzle. But the puzzles are some of the most intriguing which I have ever seen in the genre. Nothing is rushed so you always have all the time you need to figure your way out of a problem. And problems you will have. Some of the puzzles in this game are so ingenious that even though this game is 14 years old at the time of this review I was still blown away by them. For example at various stages of the game in order to advance you must use your phone to call  the exact number on a document which you recieved. The game never tells you when to do this, it's up to the player to figure out.\n\nSyberia is an amazing game, but an old game nonetheless. There is no denying that the game's engine and visuals are slightly outdated by now. Animations are sometimes funky and the game will glitch out on newer OS's. That being said this game still has some of the best voice acting I've heard in a game and the art style/set pieces still amaze. The soundtrack still stands up to this day. The cutscenes are still extremely fluid and a joy to watch.\n\nSo in conclusion if you are either looking for a great point and click or simply a break from all the violence in today's mainstream gaming industry culture Syberia is a perfect purchase.","February 4","true","1.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The backgrounds are very well done; I especially liked the haunting look of the shipwrecks around Aralbad.  The soundtrack is pretty and not intrusive, contributing to the cutscenes especially.\n\nThere are some bad points.  As a few reviews have already mentioned, movement slower than slow, and even the double-click-to-run mechanic doesn't save some parts from taking for-freaking-ever to complete.  I also discovered about halfway through that I could right-click to skip dialogue in case I accidentally clicked something I didn't mean to.  I would've loved to have known that earlier as I suffered through long repeated conversations.\n\nDespite the backgrounds being visually stunning, the character models themselves show their age and I learned that, at least on my system, alt-tabbing caused some graphical difficulties.  Nothing was game breaking and most glitches cleared themselves up if I changed rooms/views, but it was irritating for me as a chronic multitasker.\n\nThe only part of the game that was almost a dealbreaker for me was the character development, not of Kate (your playable character) but of the people she interacted with by phone throughout the game.  The selfish, shallow jerk of a fiancé, the annoying, shallow mother, the ethically-questionable, shallow best friend....all of them were honestly awful.  The worst was Kate's interaction with Dan; where she should've told him to ♥♥♥♥ off after roughly the second conversation, she instead kept taking responsibility for his poor behavior.  Even as her character developed more of a spine as the story went on, her interactions with him were still grating.  He was a self-obsessed ghoul throughout and I honestly wanted to run our little train right over him.  No combat in this game, but he might make you regret that.\n\nBut, the rest of the story was extremely unique and very truly overcomes the glitches, the slow speed, and the ridiculously badly-written supporting cast (Hans and Helena are notable exceptions to this, though, they're delightful).  If you feel like the ten dollar price tag is too much for an older game, pick it up in a bundle or on sale.  It's worth it.","February 7, 2015","true","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You get caught up in the art deco world of Validilene at the start, and before you know it you're hurtling off into the unknown (including grand universities, tropical train stations, and former Soviet factories). This is not an action-packed adventure, nor are the puzzles too challenging. This is really the kind of adventure you curl up with on the sofa on a rainy night, to relax and dream away with. It is soothing and engaging at the same time, mainly thanks to its wonderful scenery and design, and high-quality storytelling and characterization. It's almost like an interactive novel that you unfold step by step. Highly recommended.","May 31, 2015","true","11.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jragghen/recommended/46500/","Jragghen","Jragghen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jragghen/","965 products in account","Syberia is a point-and-click adventure game in which you play as Kate Walker, attempting to track down the owner of a toy factory in order to facilitate a sale. Through the game you move through a series of locations along a railway line, each of which has a series of puzzles which need to be solved in order to allow your trip to continue.\n\nAs noted in many other reviews, Kate moves rather slow, but can run if you double-click. However, when moving up/down stairs, or any other obstacles, she does move at a slow pace. As there is an unfortunate amount of backtracking involved in the course of the game and they frequently have these sorts of stairs, it can lead to a stuttered, somewhat lethargic pace.\n\nThe story feels meandering until you reach close to the end of the game, when it starts to pick up. As this game takes place in a fictional history, some items (such as how a railway would supposedly work) don't really make /sense/. If you're the sort of person where these sorts of things bother you, you might want to pass on this game. Ultimately, the question which needs to be asked is whether point-and-click adventure is something which appeals to you - while it can take some time to get truly gripping, the story is worth experiencing, provided you like that sort of gameplay.","July 5, 2015","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Then I saw Syberia bundle on sale so I bought it.....and left it in my backlog for a long time. But I am glad I got to playing Syberia. While clearly this is an old game it still keep a certain charm about itself. The story while starting slow (and a bit boring) picks up and is interesting. You get that feel of a quest or adventure as you follow Kate Walker. The voice acting is really good and I guess this is one of the reasons why Kate is likable. Gameplay is not bad but could have used less walking/running around empty corridors. Puzzles are fairly challenging and, except for a couple of them, rather logical. The graphics are old but still decent. However I encountered a lot of graphic glitches along the way. The game ends in a cliffhanger-ish manner and so I am looking forward to playing Syberia 2.

Your expanded inventory allows you to access and reference important documents, as well as to call NPC's from your cell phone.\n- An interesting plot hook that will propel your character through four unique quest/puzzle hubs.\n- The snarky comments from Oscar and James.\n\nThe okay:\n- The puzzles are very intuitive; however, I did run into trouble a few times because I either missed a dialogue cue that was necessary to advance a puzzle, or I overlooked a small clickable object due to undelineated bounding boxes.\n- There are several large screens that have absolutely nothing to interact with.  They may be pretty to look at, but they make backtracking a bit of a pain.\n- The music is good, but some of the themes are overplayed.\n\nThe ugly:\n- Can we talk about the female protagonist?  She is introduced as a hot-shot international corporate lawyer, so I thought she was going to be savvy and assertive, but she spends most of the game being emotionally manipulated by her fiance, being verbally abused by her bosses, having her femininity questioned by her backstabbing shallow co-worker, having her life choices questioned by her overbearing frivolous mother, and being jerked around by various unsavory NPC's.  The few times she starts to stick up for herself, she actually back-peddles and APOLOGIZES, and seems to be completely okay with people treating her like a doormat.  While she is smart, resourceful, and does have a fair bit of character development over the course of the game, I would have liked to see her make a conscious choice to put her foot down instead of making excuses and avoiding the issues.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 7.5/10","December 19, 2014","true","9.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The story follows Kate Walker as she travels to Europe to finalize the sale of an old automaton factory, only for her to become completely engrossed in the pursuit of adventure as she travels Europe through the life left behind by the mysterious legal owner of the factory. Ultimately it is a story about the choice between a comfortable yet mundane life, or an uncertain but adventurous one.\n\nThe puzzles make sense in their own surreal way (speaking as someone who often needs to consult walkthroughs for games like these, I figured most things out by myself), the decaying world is beautifully detailed and provides a certain sense of nostalgia, the clockwork inventions are endlessly fascinating (although not always very realistic) and the characters seem to have leapt straight from a Franco-Belgian comic.\n\nMy only negative is that the world at times feels a bit TOO abandoned and could have benefited from having a few more characters sprinkled around.","February 1, 2015","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It really deserves to be a well known classic, alongside The Longest Journey.\n\nThe world of Syberia is similar to ours, but slightly different, in its possessing intricate automaton inventions. There are many things to admire in this game, such as the details in the character and background animations, the absolutely gorgeous environments, and the creativite plot and settings. You can definitely feel the love and effort the developers put into the game. It's hard for me to describe one of the best things that Syberia does well... but I'm going to try: the world it creates is not exactly exciting, but rather relaxing in its wonderment. The atmosphere is calming and whimsical. There are no death screens, no way for you to mess up or have to start over, just you exploring a rich world. Although it might not be big on action, Syberia definitely has a lot to say. Throughout the narrative as Kate changes, the game tells both her and the player that you are capable of much more than you think. The game will move you at parts, if you let it.\n\nKeep in mind there is a sequel to this game, so some issues are left unresolved, but I feel that even without a sequel, the themes and character arcs of this story work well, even standing alone.\n\nA few things that detract from the game are the inability to make Kate move faster during some animations like walking up stairs which makes backtracking irritating, some difficult puzzles that you might need a walkthrough for, and interactive items that are sometimes easy to miss. I highly recommend using a walkthrough if you get stuck to prevent the hair-pulling frustration of combing over every pixel on the screen to find something to help you progress the game. (I don't like using walkthroughs myself, but I had to bend in this case.)\n\nHowever, these things ultimately do not take away from how much the world will enthrall you, and how much you won't want to leave when the story ends. Pick up this game if you're looking for a calming point and click adventure to help you unwind.","June 25, 2014","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had been meaning to play it for a long time and just got around to doing so.\n\nThe story revolves around an American lawyer, Kate Walker, who is sent to a town in the French Alps to finalize the sale of an Automaton company. It should be a straight-forward task but things take a turn which ends up in her traveling across various fictional locations in Europe.\n\nThe gameplay was fairly straight-forward. It's a third-person point-and-click mystery game. Very similar to early LucasArts games where you have an inventory and dialogue notebook. It wasn't frustratingly difficult unlike Frogwares' Holmes games so that's a very big positive.\n\nSettings were very atmospheric and the art-style unique and extremely beautiful. The storytelling was deep and apart from the main plot, the player also got insights into Kate's personal life as the hours wore on. Notebooks, letters, diary entries and pamphlets were essential to understanding the background story, which was very interesting.\n\nBack-tracking and running around can be a bit of a grind. That's part of the genre but regardless, Syberia is one of the best of its kind. It has a strong story, interesting characters, deep story and beautiful locations. Have to give it to Microids for their art style. Wonderful!","November 29, 2014","true","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Running from one place to another may become annoying at a certain point but these "filler" maps just add a very realistic touch to the game (we all have to walk and Syberia represents the journey of a man and woman).

Offering stunning artwork, engaging voice acting, and supported by beautiful music, it is very well crafted. In addition, the puzzles require a decent amount of thought.\n\nSyberia does have a few minor faults, although nothing game breaking. The low resolution graphics quickly show off its age and in certain spots makes it difficult to see objects. There are a couple spots where the screen scrolls as you walk toward the edge, however there is no indicator that identifies that aspect. Lastly, some of the puzzles just end up being frustrating because they get overly involved--almost anal retentive in a way.\n\nOverall, the story is what makes this game great and it leads perfectly into the sequel. It was definitely worth the time spent.","September 7, 2012","true","18.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is gripping and one of those hard-to-stop-playing adventure games.  I'd only recommend this to people who love point and click adventure games as well as culture, travel and history (albeit mostly ficitonalised).\n\nPROS:\n-engaging storyline for culture/travel/steampunk/semi-fictionalised history buffs\n-relatable human touch with main protagonist, Kate's, personal dramas over the phone in love, work and family\n-charming personal sibling history between focal characters, Hans and Anna,\n-interesting and quirky side characters from a wide spectrum\n-beautiful steampunk graphics in every scene\n-creative puzzles and challenges (easy - medium)\n-lots of fun travelling and intricately detailed and exotic steampunk places, a real gem to see.\n\nCONS:\n-slow-going gameplay in that there's a lot of awkward running/painfully slowly walking up and down stairs between several empty scenes and some long backtracking too which grated my nerves\n-some superficial side character exploration, I had lots of questions about issues raised but they weren't really answered\n-disappointed by how short the game was and main protagonist's reactions or lack thereof when interacting or in the face of injustice (found myself snarkly answering back what she should say), which did make her rather bland at times.\n\nOtherwise, I still really enjoyed it so I'd say if the pros outweigh to cons for you, give it a go!\n\np.s.\nMOST MEMORABLE PART: I found the barge owner's 'foreign' dialogue in Barrockstadt very funny given he was speaking a crazy mix of German, Russian, Spanish and French in each sentence!

Perhaps becuse its style is so similar to The Longest Journey.\n\nThe game follows Kate Walket, a lawyer, who tries to find an heir to a company for him to sign some papers. Turns out that is harder than expected and point&click puzzles follow. You get to know the characters through clues and phone calls and you do care about the story as you play.\n\nI really enjoyed the steampunk-world of Syberia. This game should be played with a guide available as some of the puzzle seem far-fetched.\n\nDo note this is game 1 of 2 and does not have a 'proper' ending. Must be played paired with the 2nd game for full experience.\n\nBecause of its dated-ness it might not be worth buying at full price. Buy it when the bundle of the 2 games is on sale.\nHowever dated the graphics are the sound effects, music and voice acting were all really good and sets a good atmosphere and mood for the game.

Inexplicably, rather than port the Windows version to the Mac, they designed a version for iOS (iPhone and iPad) and ported that version to Mac. Differences include:\n\nIn the Windows version, the mouse cursor changes as you mouse over hotspots (areas of the screen where something happens if you click there). In the Mac version, the mouse cursor never changes, but all hotspots are marked with bobbing icons.\nThe Windows version does not automatically save your progress, but has multiple save slots that you can save or load at any time. The Mac version has an autosave, and no other way to save the game.\nThe Mac version has no footstep sound effects when walking around.\nThe Windows version lets you re-watch cinematics from the menu. The Mac version does not have this.\nThe Mac version includes unlockable concept art in a “Bonus” menu that can be browsed via a clumsy drag-to-scroll interface, designed for swiping on touchscreens. On occasion while playing, you’ll see “Bonus!” in the corner, indicating that a new piece of art was unlocked. The Windows version does not have this.\nThe game will not run on widescreen resolutions on some versions of Windows. The Mac game will run at any resolution, but at an incorrect aspect ratio for either gameplay (not pillarboxed) or cinematics (not letterboxed).\nI think that’s everything. If you can play it as originally intended, or if you can live with the changes, I absolutely recommend this adventure game, though I have yet to complete it.","April 12","true","13.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The walking animations are painfully slow, dialogs drag out endlessly, items are often barely visible on screen and there just isn't much to "do" in the game. I don't feel like I'm making any decisions at all. I have fond memories of the old Lucasarts adventures (Indiana Jones, Monkey Island, etc.) but Syberia just does not come close. There are no dialog trees, you simple click yourself through "topics". Since there is no telling which topic will advance the story, you have to click through them all. On my computer there often is a noticable delay between loading parts of the dialog, which makes it even more tedious to listen to the mostly uninspired conversations. You will do a lot of walking around and the animations are so slow that you want to scream at the protagagonist to hurry the ♥♥♥♥ up.\nI bought the game to play it together with my girlfriend, but she keeps falling asleep almost every time we played. It might be fun for other people, but it's not for us and we most likely will not play to the end.\n\nI suggest trying old Lucasarts adventures, Black Mirror and Nibiru first.","October 28, 2014","false","12.2"," 28 of 55 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","28","55","3","0"

Now, just about an hour into the game, the narrative form is killing the excitement. The dialogs are illogical and very clumsy, to the point I can't remember haven seen in games for more than a decade. In the interest of fairness I probably should note that the game indeed is more than ten years old.\n\nThe dialog and story line problem:\nWhen I ask about "Y" I am told that "Y" is not relevant, when I ask about "X" I am told that I need to know about "Y" first. Same thing with the places your character can visit. You can choose to go to place "1", "2" or "3", but if you go to "2" or "3" you are told that it is not time for that yet - in a more game like fashion than that - but the point remains valid.\n\nConclusion:\nAll in all, if you are looking for a computer adventure game I suggest you spend your money on something better than "Syberia". On the other hand, if you are looking for a graphic story to click yourself through instead of yet another movie night then "Syberia" might just be worth a dollar or two - in my opinion not more than that though - certainly not ten!\n","October 19, 2014","false","13.0"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","12","24","0","0"

Being an adventure, you have to go back and forth over these same spots multiple times.  It's torturous.  I finally managed to figure out how to make her run (sometimes) after I lost my temper and repeatedly clicked where I wanted her to go while yelling "move it, for gawd's sake!!". (double clicking makes her speed up if she has a flat stretch)\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's all really cool the first time you see new scenery in the game, but after the first time it's nothing but irritating speed-bumps. There is no map, so definitely no fast travel.  If there were, I would probably enjoy the game instead of only being able to play for an hour at a stretch...by which time anyone tries to talk to me and I explode.\n\nThough I am enjoying the main story, a strange kinda mystical story about a female lawyer on the trail of a guy who builds automatons and went in search of mammoths...I would like to see where they go with that bizarre premise...I don't like the side story of the lawyer's life played out in calls she gets on her mobile phone.  [*spoiler*]  The people in her life are selfish, shallow, demanding and uncaring...and she's a complete doormat.  I cringe when her phone rings.  I am sure in the end she tells everyone to take a flying leap because otherwise she is the worst female protagonist ever, but she isn't likeable enough to care.  It's hard to root for someone who takes abuse cheerfully. [*end spoiler*].\n\nFrom what I have seen so far, I estimate the game only has 3 hours of worthwhile game-play but the devs have made it so you can't possibly complete the game in less than 10 hours.  That's a helluva lot of filler.  I don't know if I can bring myself to ever finish it...I think I'd rather pull weeds.","June 9, 2015","false","8.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","6","12","2","0"

I'm rather forgiving about errors in these games, simply because I enjoy playing them in general. But this game... I simply couldn't continue playing it.\n\nI also love steampunk, so a game that combines both should be perfect for me, right? Right?\n\nWell... it says I played this game for 4.6 hours as I write this. And while I certainly love the environment and the art of the game... I can't enjoy the game itself. Why? Because the one word that describes this game best is: "boring".\n\nFirst of all, everything seems to take forever. You slowly walk from point to point, from scene to scene, and you just wish you could somehow fast forward. This gets particularly annoying if you have to cross like 4-5 screens (one of them may be a scrolling screen), just to get from one hotspot to another.\n\nSecond, the dialogues. They are long and tedious, and more often than not, nothing helpful is being said. You ask about one thing and they tell you that you don't need to know about that. Then you ask about the other and they tell you, you must first know the one thing you were told earlier that you don't need to know about it.\n\nSPOILERS\n\nThird, the story. You're a lawyer, travelling to a remote village to finalize a purchase deal for a factory. Does that sound exciting? Yeah, certainly does. You learn that the owner of the factory died shortly before you arrived, and struggle to still buy the factory for your client. Couldn't they think of a more exciting story?\n\nFourth, the phone calls. You witness random phone calls from Kate's mother, work colleague, boyfriend/fiance (amazing that she actually has signal in such a remote place) and learn about their relationships and stuff. As far as I can tell, this has absolutely NOTHING to do with the story. It's probably supposed to add depth to the character. But was this really necessary?\n\nYes, I know, the game is old, 13 years by the time of this review. But that is not an excuse. There were great games before 13 years ago. There were great point & click games before 13 years ago. Look at the old Lucas Arts games. Indiana Jones, for example, was released 23 years ago, by the time of this review. And it was great. I played it over and over again.\n\nThis game, however... is just tedious. And boring.","December 22, 2015","false","4.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

The short review: it isn't.\n\nI'll start by echoing the main criticism others have for this game: it's a point and click adventure, which is usually my kind of thing, but it doesn't have very much discovery. Especially in the first part of the game, you will spend an inordinate amount of time wandering through streets and paths with nothing in, only to accomplish one task before you have to click yourself to some other destination.\n\nThe characters are equally boring. You play Kate Walker, an American lawyer with no personality. Along the way, you'll meet other characters who stay around in the story for one particular plotline before disappearing without warning. The exception to this rule is the robot Oscar, whose obsession with regulation is more annoying than it is a character trait, and seems to make up most of the "puzzles", which aren't really puzzles as much as they are grindingly pointless obstacles that involve more wandering around aimlessly. Frequently, you'll also be called by your friends, boss, and mother, who all interrupt at inconvenient times to say much the same thing every time they call. The two friends, Olivia and Dan, are only there to provide their own subplot, which is that Dan (Kate's fiancee) is shagging Olivia behind Kate's back. In the end, Kate doesn't seem to mind too much because she's "changed a lot", even though that change isn't really apparent to the player - Kate's just as dull as she was when the game started.\n\nWhen they do call, you'll often encounter another problem: the music. The music in the game is so loud that you'll struggle to hear the conversation you're supposed to be having and will have to rely on erratically spelt subtitles. It also seems to be largely random, playing out in some scenes but not in others, and is suspenseful at times where there is no suspense, causing the player to think something bad is going to happen when you're still just supposed to be clicking through endless screens.\n\nThe dialogue is also horrendously poor. When you get the option of talking to someone, you're presented with up to 8 one-word choices, which have very little connection to the question that Kate actually asks. For example, two that recur throughout the game are 'Mission' and 'Help', which imply the same thing but can be vastly different or frustrating similar. Another, 'Kate', can be anything from an introduction to something she's done or simply what she's thinking at the moment. This random style of conversation makes the game even longer than it needs to be.\n\nAnimation can be buggy too. For example, every time Kate boards the train, her shadow walks up the steps long after she does. It's weird that they bothered to include it in the game as broken, rather than just leave it out (and I wouldn't have noticed it if they had).\n\nIts ending is pretty bad too - I shan't spoil it, but there are two decisions Kate can make, and whereas the developers could have let the player choose, instead they force one upon you. It makes the conclusion of the game incredibly unsatisfying for the number of hours of wandering around you have to do to reach it.\n\nSome good points? Well, the art is nice (especially by 2002 standards), although the prioritisation of the art does lead to some problems (were you walking forwards? in the next screen, you'll have to walk to the left to go in the same direction, just so they can show you another artistic angle). The sound effects were probably my favourite part of the game; when they're not blasted over by music or the sound of repetitive clicking, they're actually quite immersive. Some of the concepts, like having a useable mobile phone, are pretty interesting. But those things go to waste in a game that can only be disappointing.","January 5","false","13.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

It's not uncommon to miss critical objects because they are virtually indistinguishable from their surroundings and sometimes only a couple pixels wide.\n\nThere is almost no interactivity with the environment.  If it's not critical to a puzzle, you can't click on it.  There's virtually no "flavor" anywhere.  What is that strange object over there?  *mouse over it*  Nothing.  The painting on the wall?  Nope.  The mannequin with the dress?  Nada.  The statue in the fountain?  Nil.\n\nMany of the puzzles are unnecessarily obtuse, requiring sometimes inputs with absoutely no clues what they're supposed to be.\n\nThe phone calls are EXTREMELY annoying and I want to slap every single person on the other end.  If I were the main character, I'd have chucked the phone into the first river I came across.  Only a very few of the calls are really necessary, maybe 4 out of the couple dozen you make or recieve.  Most are either your idiot boss berating you for things that are outside of your control, or they're about your relationship with your fiance.\n\nThe worst part, however, is the walking.  You'll end up walking back and forth and back and forth over and over, even if you know what you're doing.  There are screen transitions every few steps in some areas; most train platforms are 5 or 6 screens wide.  And the main character moves so slowly and has such difficulty with stairs that she must be part Dalek!\n\nI'm a long time player of point-and-click adventure games, going back to titles such as Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Space Quest and Maniac Mansion, and I have to say that this is one of the worst such titles I've ever played.","February 26","false","8.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I've played plenty of adventure games with click-based movement before, but what makes Syberia comparable in enjoyment to a lobotomy is that for at least the first half of the game 95% of the rooms and screens you run across have no objects, objectives, or point whatsoever except to look pretty, and you're left having to run across giant maps with maybe 3 useful rooms in them altogether, all of which are spread out.\n\nOh and here's the solution to every other puzzle: You need a key. Chances are it's nearby. If you don't need a key then prepare for some moderate-yet-annoying pixelhunting, and running through every room 3 times because you got everything right but now there's an extra little something you need to do that seems to have no point other than to add another 30+ minutes of "gameplay" to Syberia.\n\nI will say the story is interesting enough. It could've been more in-depth but that would've cut into Kate's marathon time I'm sure. I liked listening to Kate's phonecalls as a side-story. The art -as pointless as it was at times - was very well done and pretty especially considering when the game originially came out. And I really did love all the characters within the game, as the majority seem very well thought out.\n\nSyberia is pretty, interesting, and it sure does seem like a classic adventure. But the long dragging gameplay will eventually have even the most casual point-and-click gamer feeling more like they're just doing a chore.","August 18, 2015","false","9.5"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","0"

There's no way to beat the game without bruteforce or gamefaqs.\n\nHuge flaw #2: It takes forever for Kate's lethargic slow body to move anywhere. You can sometimes run by double clicking, but even the running is too slow and her animations are interrupted by things like stairs, doors, and small inclines, all of which cause Kate to halt and ponder each step for precious seconds while she lumbers her way inch by inch. And even if you manage to get the game to run in windowed mode, the game will pause if you alt-tab. So you can't even browse the web or play another game while waiting for Kate's prodigious girth to waddle across town.\n\nFlaw #3: The characters are annoying and unlikable.

It's not that the puzzles are difficult, per se, but it has an extremely frustrating mechanic where you are forced to talk to the same person repeatedly to unlock the next part of the story, and if you click through the dialog at reading pace instead of listening to the full audio then it doesn't trigger the unlock. As a result you can spend a lot of time backtracking and sitting through conversations you already had just so you can interact with an unrelated object elsewhere, which in turn unlocks another long dialog in the first location. This would be fine if the characters were compelling, but the universe is just not particularly to my tastes - it is sort of a quirky magical realist steampunky thing that makes me wish I could get back to the "real life" story on the other end of the phone. Maybe worth the effort if the universe captures your imagination, but not for me. I gave up partway through Syberia II. For old adventures I would recommend The Longest Journey over this series.","January 31, 2015","false","10.6"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","2","10","0","0"

I used to play Sierra games back in the day and Syberia is an artifact of its time, which makes it rather slow, linear, and obtuse from a modern viewpoint.\n\nNo, what bugs me about Syberia is its savoir faire. It has a style, and that's fine... but when that style is built with backstory and plot to basically make a Gary Stu the most important man in the world, where everyone must love him if they have a soul, and everyone /does/ love him because he's so special... that bugs me. Okay, so there's a guy who's such a mechanical genius that he can make mechanical life. Fine. But then he makes all his mechanisms toys because he's simple, you see, he's so innocent and pure. If that's not saccharine enough to make your teeth hurt, the developers start to assume you're some sort of mouthbreather and actually spell it out for you: he is pure and innocent and just and kind and has never done anything wrong ever, in pretty much so many words.\n\nMaybe it's because I'm an engineer by trade, but the game smacks of an alternate history wondering why we couldn't all be more innocent. Why couldn't our society be made by toymakers with quaint clockwork mechanisms running everything? Others have spoken about how the game is anti-American; I think it's more anti-modern since it hails back to pastoral scenes in rural towns and, of course, the clockwork... yet as much as they say that the Good Old Days were so great, said Good Old Days never were and the clockwork fantasy underlines that they don't even want to sacrifice anything for the Good Old Days. We want our toymaker utopia, but with faster, better trains and /artificial life/ slave labor. I've no time for backwards-looking utopias, since the past wasn't as great as everyone makes it out to be. I've got even less time than that for backwards-looking utopias that want all of the benefits of technological society without any of its drawbacks, because mechanical magic will somehow keep the spring-loaded spaceships from being missiles or the wind-up automatons from being soldiers or the super-fast super-green trains from being tanks.","February 18, 2015","false","10.8"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","2"

Maybe it's because it's more of a interactive cinematic experience than a game, but it seems so unnecessarily long. While you'll get ~10+ hrs of playtime, most of it is spent walking/running/climbing stairs and trying useless locked doors around rather than solving puzzles. There seem to be gratuitous long shots and panning shots of scenery that serve no other purpose than to show off the scenery, because there isn't anything that can be interacted with in those scenes, which means lots and lots of walking/running to get to the next screen. There are also lots of stairs and ladders that cause Kate Walker to slow down and climb step by step and normal pace. Throw in some backtracking and the minutes of walking/running/climbing add up to hours.\n\nFor a game with a story, sometimes you have no idea what you're doing since it's rather easy to do things before they make any narrative sense, especially in Valadilene where you aren't told much of anything. Mostly, in the first two areas (Valadilene and Barockstast), you're just wandering around trying locked doors because there are no maps or directions to so-and-so place you're supposed to go. You'd think Kate Walker would at least try to ask someone where the notaary was or the rector's office instead of wasting time running around trying to find the place.\n\nThe story felt flat to me. It doesn't really go anywhere for most of the game and ends in a cliffhanger. You get Kate Walker's backstory through incessant phone calls that interrupt gameplay, but the subplot or even Kate Walker's story seems pointless in the grand scheme of things. Every phone conversation felt like Kate Walker didn't particularly care, even though her relationships were falling apart. That's probably no surprise given how she has no qualms about breaking and entering, theft, and manipulating people, but given how every NPC is incompetent, unhelpful or insane, that's probably the only way the story advances.\n\nIt's frustrating how almost every NPC is incompetent, cowardly unhelpful, and/or insane. In fact, the incompetency and cowardice drive the puzzles on the journey to search for the heir, and the puzzle aren't even directly related to the plot. It's just multiple long chains of small favor type quests after Valadilene. There just aren't any likable characters, except maybe the hotel manager at Aralbad, who seems to be the only person with any good sense.","July 21, 2014","false","9.9"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"

I'm judging it in 2014, so it's hard to put on your 2002-goggles and see the game when those mediums weren't nearly as popular as they are now. It has fantastic art, a unique setting, and the sort of characters you'd want in any form of fiction, but the gameplay isn't just plodding and unchallenging, it completely detracts from the experience. Even when you know exactly what to do or where you want to go, you often have to traverse multiple empty, pointless, often pretty scenes. It takes 5 minutes to do absolutely anything (start run animation, come to full stop, change scene, start run animation...) and much of the game involves running back and forth between 2-3 points. It's certainly not a bad experience, but it wasn't one I needed to spend 8 hours on. Maybe I'm spoiled by modern action packed short games like Telltale adventures that focus on fun, but you can tell Syberia is an art project first and game second.

I was disappointed. While the game is one of the few to actually present an original premise (so many are derivatives of a “you are a quiet antihero looking for vengeance”) the entirety of the plot is really presented in the first few minutes of the game. Character development takes place through a series of phone calls which are supposed to show the personal growth of the main character through the use of a sub-plot, but really have no connection to the main events of the game, nor do they server to connect you to the hero. It is also unfortunate that the English voice-acting (can’t speak for other language tracks) is overdone, so that you find yourself skipping dialogue lines as quickly as you can read them, rather than listen to the hammy delivery. In spite of this, I could still have lived with the story, were it not for a number of serious troubles with the plot (see spoiler section to read my beefs).\nStory was to be my main attraction, but the game still could have been saved by looking pretty or playing well. Graphics have aged considerably, and no longer look presentable (excepting fixed-angle, pre-rendered scenery), while the game features a boring “click and wait while your character walks slowly across the screen” interface. This dynamic is exacerbated by the fact that many puzzles have you walking from one place to another to deliver an item or take a second look at an area now opened by dialogue.\n***************\nSPOILER ALERT – Complaints about Story\n***************\nHans sent plans so a train could be built. Who built the tracks? Who built the winding stations? Why didn’t Hans just follow them to (the presumably final) destination of Syberia?\nExcept for his role in obstructing your progress, what does the automaton do that you couldn’t? Why not just leave him and drive the train yourself?\nWhere has Hans been in between the University/factory and appearing at the salt flats? He isn’t said to have recently departed anywhere you visit, but he shows up at the same time as (and presumably with) a plane headed to NY?\nThe Professor’s lecture says that the mysterious aboriginal Russians have not been observed in their native practices for 100+ years and then goes on to give extensive detail about their habits and legends.

I guess it got marks for being released at a time when no one was making point-and-click adventures so it was the only way for fans of the genre to get ther fix.\n\nFirst off it has really boring puzzles. The only time I ever got stuck was when I couldn't believe that the puzzles could be that simple. Yeah, the genre gets flak for having incomprehensible logic behind the puzzles, but that's a huge part of what made them fun and memorable. That ah-ha moment when you find the designer's line of logic and it all comes together. I'm streching to even call these puzzles. One major one involves tring to fix a mechanical bandstand. The first part of the puzzle is basically a trading quest to get the obvious item needed to open it up and when I got inside I assumed there would be some kind of Myst style mechanical puzzle to fix it. Nope, you pull a lever and it's solved. That's this game's puzzles in a nutshell.\n\nThen there's this game's travesty of a traslation and dialogue. It's not even hilariously bad ala Kings Quest V. You're travelling across Europe for ♥♥♥♥'s sake and maybe three character's even speak with a European accent. Who directed these voice actors? Did they even read the title of this game much less the description? Then the writing alternated between bad drama and bad witty banter. Not ever offensively bad and at times there's a spark of charm about it, but coupled with dull gameplay it's hard to care.\n\nI will give the game points for visuals. It looks a lot like Final Fantasy VIII with a lot of old looking European architecture that speaks of a long history, but also of areas that have hit hard times with building slowly falling apart and mechanical things beginning to go to rust. The game has an appealing alternate present aesthetic going on that isn't explored much, but I still kind of liked it. Nothing enough to save the game from dull gameplay.","February 11, 2014","false","12.2"," 2 of 23 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","2","23","0","0"

Wait for a while, mourn the loss of your favourite Shifter, give Dreamfall a try. But don't play Syberia. Give it a real chance to make you fall in love with it.

Upon learning about  the last living heir is still alive somewhere in Europe, Kate goes on an unpredictable journey through exotic and historical like lands to find the heir who is able to save the antomaton company from bankruptcy. While Kate herself will soon discover how much of a blast it is to travel across foreign lands as oppose to being just an everyday New York lawyer. Created by Benoit Sokal who previously did Amerzone, this game takes place in the same universe as that game except this time the protagnogist has an identity and there's a bigger cast of characters to interact with. Making this the game that the public would recogonize Sokal the most. The story is well written, the backgrounds are like a living painting, and the characters are very memorible both major and secondary a like.

Its unique characters and gorgeous settings are shown in great detail, rich animation and creative design, and this carries on throughout the entire game. In fact, both get even more elaborate. There are a few annoying animations and the occasional empty areas you are forced to walk through that only serve to connect point A to point B, but they don’t take away from the game that much.\n\nThe sound effects help bring the world to life and are fitting for each area whether it be beautiful sounds of nature or the mechanical sounds of the city. They help to immerse you in the world that Syberia creates, although there are some volume issues with quiet lines of spoken dialogue or overly loud sound effects but these are few and far between. The music… my word, the music is a treat. Cinematic orchestra swells in and the low woodwind bellows help pull you into this game that only feels like a movie.\n\nOf course, the real treat in Syberia is the story. It caught me off guard. What starts as a story about a toy factory turns into one of the most beautiful dramas about heart and humanity that I have seen in a while topping most movies and TV shows I have seen. Even the subplot between our hero and her boyfriend begins to take center stage and melds with the main plot at the end that could bring tears to your eyes.\n\nIf you love adventure games or great stories in general, you are doing yourself a disservice by not playing Syberia.","July 16, 2014","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have a lot of patience you should really try it out.\n\nOn with the points of improvement in my opinion. This game is not an open world at all, at a lot of doors, Kate will tell you to 'not go down there'. On the one side this is logical, due to the fact that the player will not know where to look for the next clue, on the other side; do not make the doors clickable if the door is no use. Next to that, I did some running around and got to the next clue after 5 'empty' screens. When the clue was found I had to go back the same way.. this really tested my patience.\n\nAll-in-all: If it wasn't for the low price I paid, I would be less positive about this game. It is just not worth €10, my advice therefor is to buy this game during sale (at least -80%).

Syberia is a game about a female lawyer named Kate Walker, who is on a business trip to help settle a merger between a toy company and a doomed antomaton company. Upon learning about  the last living heir is still alive somewhere in Europe, Kate goes on an unpredictable journey through exotic and historical like lands to find the heir who is able to save the antomaton company from bankruptcy. While Kate herself will soon discover how much of a blast it is to travel across foreign lands as oppose to being just an everyday New York lawyer. Created by Benoit Sokal who previously did Amerzone, this game takes place in the same universe as that game except this time the protagnogist has an identity and there's a bigger cast of characters to interact with. Making this the game that the public would recogonize Sokal the most. The story is well written, the backgrounds are like a living painting, and the characters are very memorible both major and secondary a like. When it comes to the best European made video games this title would land on the top 10 spot no questions asked.","March 20, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Visually beautiful, always interesting, and so full of life, Syberia is one of those games that sticks with you long after you've played it. The people are as colorful and interesting as the environments, even the minor characters you don't need to speak with have distinct personalities. The attention to story-telling detail of this game shows that the makers truely cared about what they made.\nTypical of the point-and-click adventures of that time, there are moments where you are left waiting for a character to run from point A to point B, and sometimes details can be overlooked and cause frustration, but it does not manage to detract from the beauty and heart of this game. Besides, the game is old enough now that there is a plethora of walkthroughs to pick from for when you get stuck.\nIf you want an adventure and like getting lost in the charm of an old world, this game is for you.","March 6, 2014","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of the steampunk genre, both the story and the scenery are beautiful, and the charecters well-developed. With a dash of humor at some times, and a pinch of sadness at others, as well as an overall sense of nostalgia, this is a point-and-click player's dream game. Difficult, to be sure, and at times frustrating, but who wants a game that is too easy?\nAll-in-all, a well-rounded game. If there is anything that might be considered a drawback, it is that the controls are slightly... slow. It is mildly time-consuming just to get around.

The story takes you across several locations spanning all the way to eastern europe. Most of the puzzles are pretty simple fetch quests placed along with the story filling the gaps in between. The game could really have used a tooltip for clickable locations as it can be hard to find specific items and places due to the cursor system being a simple glowing/not glowing/magnifying glass method. Also the characters seem (vocally) really out of place for their expected locales.

Also the clockwork fantasy theme appeals on a subjective level, and the script and voice acting are generally fine, bar a few odd casting moments (a cockney-scripted npc read in a jarringly posho way, for example) and fair few irritating characters. Puzzle-wise, the game is pretty fair, especially to begin with, and pixle-hunting is minimal throughout.\n\nHowever it grows increasingly exasperating, with multiple instances of a path, or action, somewhere behind you being arbitrarily "unlocked" only after completing an unrelated action, hence there is a lot of aimless back-tracking. This is made all the more painful, and less forgivable, by the lack of any "fast-travel" function, and the almost absurdly expansive areas go from being an asset to a curse. Some of this is excusable given the game's age, whereas some leads to the conclusion that the game was simply rushed, as the ambition shown by the landscape design isn't quite matched for quality by the rest of the game.\n\nOverall the game would be far better if the work done on the game-world was halved and that time was spent on polishing the puzzles and features instead. The positives will be enough for some (including myself) to soldier through but your patience will be tested.","September 10, 2015","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That took me about 2.5 hours to figure out, and I felt very stupid afterwards.\n\nEnvironments are quite pretty, and the overall atmosphere is well-constructed in each scene.  You spend a lot of time exploring examples of dilapidated glory.  But for all the quiet ruin, the characters that inhabit it are surprisingly fun.  Kate, the lead, is actually kind of a jerk (mostly for gameplay reasons), which I find hilarious.\n\nGameplay is smooth, and interactions are clear.  My only complaint is that Kate takes stairs like she's worried about breaking a hip.  Play this if you want a nonviolent, low-pressure but engrossing adventure and a unique story to explore.","June 30, 2014","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have a lot of patience you should really try it out.\n\nOn with the points of improvement in my opinion. This game is not an open world at all, at a lot of doors, Kate will tell you to 'not go down there'. On the one side this is logical, due to the fact that the player will not know where to look for the next clue, on the other side; do not make the doors clickable if the door is no use. Next to that, I did some running around and got to the next clue after 5 'empty' screens. When the clue was found I had to go back the same way.. this really tested my patience.\n\nAll-in-all: If it wasn't for the low price I paid, I would be less positive about this game. It is just not worth €10, my advice therefor is to buy this game during sale (at least -80%). I definitely want to know how it ends and start playing Syberia 2.","July 1, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics and pretty views are not enough to support a game alone, and I would not give it thumbs up if that were the only positive.  I did say 'dry and dull', but, while it takes a while to get to the point, the story it tells is a solid 8 outta 10,  and a number of the recurring characters are memorable.  Fair warning in advance, this is only half the story, and ends without real closure.  The sequel, Syberia 2 is the continuation, and actually wraps things up, so, if you want to get this one, you'll need to get the next one, too.","September 29, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That took me about 2.5 hours to figure out, and I felt very stupid afterwards.\n\nEnvironments are quite pretty, and the overall atmosphere is well-constructed in each scene.  You spend a lot of time exploring examples of dilapidated glory.  But for all the quiet ruin, the characters that inhabit it are surprisingly fun.  Kate, the lead, is actually kind of a jerk (mostly for gameplay reasons), which I find hilarious.\n\nGameplay is smooth, and interactions are clear.  My only complaint is that Kate takes stairs like she's worried about breaking a hip.  Play this if you want a nonviolent, low-pressure but engrossing adventure and a unique story to explore.","June 30, 2014","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have a lot of patience you should really try it out.\n\nOn with the points of improvement in my opinion. This game is not an open world at all, at a lot of doors, Kate will tell you to 'not go down there'. On the one side this is logical, due to the fact that the player will not know where to look for the next clue, on the other side; do not make the doors clickable if the door is no use. Next to that, I did some running around and got to the next clue after 5 'empty' screens. When the clue was found I had to go back the same way.. this really tested my patience.\n\nAll-in-all: If it wasn't for the low price I paid, I would be less positive about this game. It is just not worth €10, my advice therefor is to buy this game during sale (at least -80%). I definitely want to know how it ends and start playing Syberia 2.","July 1, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, I can't really say I don't like this game.  It's a visual treat for the eyes, a mostly realistic world, starting in a small villaiage in Russia, altered somewhat by a fantasy steampunkish clockwork science. Graphics and pretty views are not enough to support a game alone, and I would not give it thumbs up if that were the only positive.  I did say 'dry and dull', but, while it takes a while to get to the point, the story it tells is a solid 8 outta 10,  and a number of the recurring characters are memorable.  Fair warning in advance, this is only half the story, and ends without real closure.  The sequel, Syberia 2 is the continuation, and actually wraps things up, so, if you want to get this one, you'll need to get the next one, too.","September 29, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yeah, I do that sometimes, it's not even my genre. But wow, I got myself a piece of gold here. I am not much into the Point'n'Click genre as said, but it is good to know that there are games like this which convince me to actually poke my head below the surface (poor metaphors, yay. no seriously wtf did I just write there).\nWell, technically and graphically, this game is... well. Just keep it's age in mind, it's from 2002 yo. But considering that, these backgrounds are just WOW. Probably some of the prettiest and most detailed I know of (operative word is 'I'). Cought myself acting up to take a neat screenshot here and there.\nThe gameplay is quite slow paced, like in most of the genre's games (I guess; me lacking experience here) - But sometimes I could strangle Kate for her unbearable stair-walking behavior (JUST CLIMB 'EM DOWN ALREADY ahh, wrong side of the train again FML), just saying. The puzzles are mostly comprehensible and challenging enough so that even a beginner like me can solve them just by thinking. No actual brain- or logic breakers here (I still had to take a walkthrough four or five times, but mainly thanks to my own stupidity). The items are mostly located at logical places, the solution may be even located just next to the keyhole where it should be by logic. I like this!\nThe story is really intense for what I have felt. I actually felt the necessity to accomplish Kate's mission in the first place and solve the problems not for the problems' sake, but to finally get to that damn Hans. Just like Kate, over the time I really got involved into the story behind the automatons and their creators (I inhaled EVERY document - including Anna's wole diary). I can't remember being confused about details that I didn't catch - simply because I did NOT miss out on anything. This is a rare event in more gameplay-driven games like shooters - maybe I should play more games of this kind; or play games in my native language more often... on the other hand... ugh, still prefer the original voices. German localization sucks in most cases. anyway B2T\n\nLong story short: I had tons of fun playing it and figuring out the ways through the story. It became one of these games I enjoyed putting 14 hours of my precious free time into without regrets. The end came a bit sudden for my taste, but the story does not end there; and some day I WILL get myself the sequel(s), definitely.\nI can just highly recommend this game to whoever is looking for an involving, story driven experience with an interesting setting - and maybe, like me, having never touched Point'n'Click before.\n\nAnd if you are really, REALLY not interested into that genre AT ALL... Man, still give this one a try.\nI did, too.\n\nPS: Maybe it is just me, but I think I had some sound issues on Windows10, which (I am sure of) weren't there on Windows7. Some of the sceneries had almost no sound at all. But if that's in the game: a little minus for sound design ;D","August 11, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because the story doesn't stop there, and I look forward to Syberia II.\n\nSo, if you don't mind some point-and-click material, holding up a mysterious but intriguing setting, then I would recommend this game.","May 19","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The 3D models don't look amazing as it's an old game but the scenery and overall atmosphere is wonderful. The story is full of adventure and discovery with unique and sometimes funny characters.\n\nIt features a steampunk-ish style, however, automotons and other mechanisms are powered by clockwork rather than steam.\n\nIf you're looking for a nice slow game to relax to, this is it.","May 22","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Another 30% goes for reading huge amounts of texts.\nMore to that you have to cross some buffer zones which are path blockers, locked doors,  walls or different sides of buildings and other objects which don't have any meaning for them except as for decorations and they just take your time and make it feel booring...\nEverything else is ok. Game is worth playing.\nStill I suggest you wait for a discount on a Syberia Bundle. Current price is too high.","May 11","true","13.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice characterization is great (I defy you not to fall in love with Momo).\n\nThe backdrops are very unique and the puzzles are logical for the most part.\n\nThe story was gripping and heart rending at times.\n\nI found myself really feeling for some of the characters.\n\nHighly recommend it.\n\nNow to start Syberia 2.","June 4","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By God is this plot amazing. Now, it does have some flat and/or awkward moments, but I was enthralled the whole way. All the characters are interesting and entertaining, discluding everyone you speak to on the phone (but, after finishing this, that may have been intentional). And finally (for a point and click game, at least), there wasn't a whole lot of frustration with a majority of the puzzles. It'd be only nitpicking to point out the three times I had to consult a walkthrough, since I didn't feel cheated when learning how simple the solutions were. The only technical problem I came across was that some of the subtitles were noticebly off. Plus there is a point where a single character, for some reason, decided to speak so softly that I couldn't understand him. But still, amazing game.","June 5","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
