So you eventually just have to leave the server because no one can kill him and things are getting hostile since it's no fun for anyone but him and now people are raging about hacks that may or may not exist?\n\nWell now you can be that guy!\n________________________________________\n\nJust an add on for the top reviews saying the game is too short, I spent 2-3 hours on the story, I've spent 7-8 hours so far on the modes I unlocked after beating story and I've still not gotten to unlocking all the endless arenas or challanges. So I'm just going to respectfully disagree with the price not being worth it.\n\nThe BULK of the game and its unlockables appears to be after you beat the story line.\n\n________________________________________\n\nLots of arguments going on about this game, since I've somehow ended up as a top review I'll go ahead and expand further on why I think the game is worth the price with things I've said in the comments.\n\nThe story is just a  prelude to the meat of the game, a fabric to wrap the metagame of the arena/arcade shooter in. Why you're doing this seemingly pointless task of killing red guys, the sort of world you're fighting in, etc.\n\nThe story itself doesn't flat out tell you much either, even after you beat it you still have to piece things together by explore the menus, hidden features, chat logs, and there's also secrets and hidden terminals on each level of the campaign that let you access more lore/chat logs... something to go back and find after you've beaten them once.\n\nBut in the end much like in a fighting game you're really just here for the mechanics anyway, so buy it for that and you shouldn't be disappointed.","February 25","true","30.4"," 804 of 958 people (84%) found this review helpful 353 people found this review funny","84","804","958","353","18"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/322500/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Gaming has long struggled with how to simulate truly cinematic fights. Fighting games have a mess of choreographed moves and buttons, RPGs have cutscenes, and FPSes have had everything from bullet time to scripted executions. Some of these have come tantalizingly close (thank you Max Payne) to those magic John Woo moments, but nothing has nailed it quite like SUPERHOT.\n\nThe key is the whole "time moves when you do" thing. It turns the game into a strategic first-person shooter, giving you the chance to plan your moves with pin-point precision. Enemies can be armed with pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, swords, and even just their fists, with one hit being deadly. You, on the other hand, have the temporal freedom to weave between bullets, catch weapons out of midair, huck bottles and telephones at people, and yes, cut bullets with a katana. The interface is simple and crystal clear, changing your crosshairs based on context (it rotates when reloading or changes to a fist when someone is in melee range) and highlighting enemies in range of certain effects like sword swings. At the end of each round, the game shows you a replay of your spree with all the pauses removed, turning it into a perfect ballet of Matrix-style murder. You can even upload it with a single click to the game's adorably-named KILLSTAGRAM for the world to see.\n\nWhen you first load the game you'll be thrown into the story mode, presented as a mix of levels designed to ease you into your abilities and terminal chats between you and others. The interface for the game deserves special mention, a 100% ASCII terminal system with its own fake file structure and side .exe files. Story mode makes the most of this presentation, messing with the interplay between game and user interface in clever ways. Though the 2-hour story treads some well-worn cyberpunk themes, it does so with a certain confidence and flair that few games can manage.\n\nTwo hours might sound short, but the story is really a primer for the modes unlocked after you beat it, split into endless and challenge modes. Endless is a progressions of arenas, each with a proper go nuts mode and then bonus versions with time limits or kill targets. All you need to do to unlock additional arenas and modes is to rack up kills wherever and however you want. Challenge breathes new life into the story levels, imposing new gameplay rules for you to learn. The first challenge is katana only but it quickly spirals off into ghost modes, speedruns, one-punch styles, and more. Even the art style of the game changes for a few of them.\n\nIn the end it's important to note that SUPERHOT is more of an arena game than a story-based one, and that means your enjoyment will hinge on how much you like shattering red dudes in different ways. However, even beyond the wealth of modes and challenges, the game is a visceral delight. Killing enemies makes them shatter with full-bodied glass scattering effects, your guns sound robust and threatening, swords bisect enemies in fine Metal Gear Rising tradition, and so on. The art style keeps everything clear and fresh, and the sound design is just as poignant as it needs to be. Adding to that the clever terminal interface with all its little minigames and secrets and you have a package that can keep you busy for dozens of hours. You have no idea how addictive killing the same dudes over and over can be until you do it with such style as SUPERHOT is built for.","March 2","true","13.5"," 244 of 301 people (81%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","81","244","301","8","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/recommended/322500/","MrWoodenSheep","MrWoodenSheep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/","2272 products in account","Superhot is a first person shooter with a very interesting and satisfying mechanic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP5pOyi5nxU\nThe main focus of Superhot, is that time only moves when you move. Fortunately, the game constantly keeps things fresh, so the time mechanic doesn't feel gimmicky or boring.\n\nYou and you enemies both die with one bullet, which makes things quite intense, and prevents the time thing from being too overpowered.\nThe game gives you a wide range of moves to make you feel like a badass. You may throw your gun or any random object like a statue at an enemy to temporarily stun them. In doing so, they will also drop their weapon. That gives you a chance to take the weapon and kill opponents, or just beat them to death while they're vulnerable.\n\nThere's a decent variety when it comes to weapons. Katanas, pistols and shotguns are just a few. The great thing is if you can use them, be sure that they can be used against you.\n\nThe game is very stylized. Enemies shatter into small crystal-like pieces, and text flashes on the screen as if you're playing an interactive trailer. There's no HUD, so even when you run out of ammo, your only indication is AFTER you have gotten ready for a shot, and pulled the trigger. The text will tell you you're out, and you have to discard the gun. It all makes for some really intense fights.\n\nThe game can actually be quite slow-paced at times. Almost like a strategy or puzzle game. You need to minimize your movements to avoid forwarding time much, or zig-zag dodge bullets.\n\nAt the end of every level, you have a chance to save a replay in case you did something cool.\n\nThere's actually quite an interesting story that I don't want to go into, because it's best unspoiled. Don't expect a focus on story, but it's nice that it's there.\n\nThe main game was quite short. Took me about 2 hours to beat, but there are a lot of challenges that increase replay value for you, and an endless mode where you can put your skills to the test. The gameplay is satisfying enough to make me want to go through and complete those.\n\nOverall, it's such an awesome game. It's incredibly satisfying, and makes you feel like an action hero. If you like the look of it, then you have to play this game, I've never seen anything like it before.\n\nRecommended!","February 25","true","10.9"," 430 of 574 people (75%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","75","430","574","22","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/322500/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","SUPER. HOT. SUPER. HOT. SUPER. HOT. SUPER. HOT. SUPER. HOT. After playing a little over 6 hours, I think it's pretty safe to say that SUPERHOT is one of the most interesting games I've played in a while. There are a few flaws and an intimidating price tag, but it's worth your time if you get it on sale.\n\nGraphics\nThe visuals have gotten mixed reception, but I'm personally a fan of the art style here. It's simple without feeling lazy, like many other indie games when it comes to their graphics. Plus, I can't help but watch the red guys as they crumple to the ground after they were killed. It makes every kill feel ten times more satisfying. Overall, the art style is simple in a good way.\n\nGameplay\nI'm not going to lie, this game is incredibly fun. It definitely deserves the title as one of the most innovative shooters in years, and surprised me with the amount of content post-campaign. Yes, the main story IS really short, but I'll get in depth with that in the "Replayability" section of my review. The gameplay mechanics are unique and really creative. Watching a replay of you after you die/win (depending on the mode) makes you feel really badass. I don't need to explain the gameplay much, as you can just watch a video of it and know what you're in for. I will say, however, that it was executed very well and is about as fun as it looks. Plus, when you beat the game, you unlock endless and challenge modes, which give the game much more to do after you finish the campaign. Let the videos speak for themselves with this section.\n\nStory\nThe game comes off as a "kill bad guys" sort of game, but as you progress through the main storyline, you'll start to notice the game getting increasingly suspicious, without getting into details. It gets increasingly interesting as you go on, and while some people find it kind of absurd or weird, I found it to be pretty good. I'm starting to notice an increase in games that break the fourth wall frequently and try to toy with your mind, examples being Undertale and Pony Island as some of the better ones. SUPERHOT doesn't get to levels of those two in terms of mind♥♥♥♥ing, but saying that the plot is boring or underwhelming would be a lie. The ending is one of the most clever endings I've seen in a video game. Once I was brought back to the menu, I stared at the screen, slowly clapping because of how creative it was. To conclude, I am pleasantly surprised with the story here.\n\nAudio\nThere isn't much in terms of audio. Some music, but the game is usually quiet. It relies on sound effects and the constant "SUPER. HOT. SUPER. HOT." to make your ears happy. Not much to say here, to be honest. As I said, the game is pretty quiet, and the sound effects aren't all that noteworthy. The only thing you'd remember here are the two words that you should probably know at this point.\n\nReplayability\nOkay, I understand that the storyline is very short. Some people have finished this game in about an hour or two. I'm not very good at this game, and I did take my time with some parts, so I finished it in around three hours. The story is very interesting, but it didn't leave much else to question. So yes, the main story IS very short and that is a problem with the game. However, with the endless and challenge modes I talked about earlier, you'll probably spend some more time with the game. Rather than feeling like filler content, I actually wanted to play more of the game because of how much fun the mechanics are. No, this isn't like Skyrim and you're probably only going to get a few more hours of content, but at least there's more to do post-game.\n\nVerdict\nOverall, SUPERHOT is very different and I am overall satisified with the experience. There are a few flaws, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons, so I can recommend this game. Just be cautious with that $25 price tag and know what you're getting into if you do decide to buy it at that price.\n\nGraphics - 8.5//10\nGameplay - 9.5/10\nStory - 8.0/10\nAudio - 7.0/10\nReplayability - 8.0/10\n\n.:7.9/10:.\n\n+Pretty art style\n+Interesting story\n+Unique gameplay mechanics\n+Endless & challenge modes add replayability\n+Clever ending\n\n-Expensive price tag\n-Short campaign","March 13","true","12.1"," 64 of 74 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","64","74","4","3"

Certainly the most innovative shooter I've played for quite some time. It's on the level of Portal with it's ingenuity. You will enjoy the time mechanics. I have nothing negative to say about the gameplay - it's superb.\n\nNearly as important, though, is how depressingly short the game is. I beat it in 1.4 hours with a moderate amount of failure and taking the time to enjoy the story.  In an age where we buy games that can take hundreds of hours to complete - a game that only takes 1.4 is simply far too short.  It's not worth the price.  I didn't get $25 worth of play from this game, because it isn't there.  The game ends just as you fall in love with it.  It's an abrupt relationship.\n\nThis should be your first buy during the next big steam sale. $5-10 would be perfect.  Put it on your wishlist and don't forget about it, but don't buy it right now.  It's not worth your $25.   If it was a proper length then I'd pay $60 for it because the idea is innovative and fresh.

I will add a TL;DR at the end\n\nGameplay\nSUPERHOT has an amazing game mechanic where when you move time moves making every single motion count. It’s a very fun game but had a short campaign mode. In the game you are given superhot.exe by a friend and are told to try it out, from the beginning it is just killing random red enemies as you control time and allow yourself be look like you came out of an action movie where you are a special agent or something along those lines. As you head further there is a plot and it darkens quickly. There are also little side games and such you can access if you are bored or listen to a game generated chatroom (because why join one yourself). The levels are fun and interesting with levels of difficulty trying to dodge enemies and bullets from all angles. The main storyline however feels short and beatable after a not so long period of time. However there is also an endless mode, mini games, and challenges.\n\nGraphics/Sound\nSo SUPERHOT’s graphics are pretty basic but with the type of gameplay it contains it feels as if you shatter glass figures when you destroy the red enemies adding a special kind of satisfaction. The sound is very useful for being able to tell if you are being shot from behind or anywhere and has saved me a few times. I love the polish song at the credits, did not even notice the the developers were polish untill I recognized some of the last names and the song.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Amazing gameplay mechanic\n+ Replays of levels once beaten\n+ Satisfyingly violent\n+ Addictive\n+ Other modes and mini games\n+ Full controller support\n\nCons\n\n- Relatively short campaign/story\n- Pretty simple story\n\nSuggestions\nHere are some suggestions I feel would improve the game\n\n- Expansion to campaign/story\n- Future ability to design levels\n- More weapons\n\nFinal Thoughts\nSUPERHOT has completely brought something new and I loved it. It felt amazing to have bullets simply flow right past me as I dodged, punched the guy, took his gun, and shot him and 3 other guys. It’s a shame how short the main story is but an amazingly impressive title nonetheless. I cannot however judge this game as not being good enough for how long it's taken because I was not a part of that process like some were so I am just evaluating SUPERHOT for itself.\n\nI would definitely say that as a game, as a mechanic it has an ace in the hole even though it is rather short\n\nSUPER HOT SUPER HOT SUPER HOT SUPER HOT SUPER HOT SUPER HOT SUPER HOT SUPER HOT\n\nTL;DR\nSUPERHOT has been completely revolutionized through its game mechanic as time moves with you. It also contains alternate modes and mini games. Overall currently it is a short but sweet game with a shorter campaign but amazing and addicting gameplay.\n\n** Key was provided by developer for review purposes **\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","February 27","true","11.9"," 213 of 307 people (69%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","69","213","307","13","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tirtel/recommended/322500/","tirtel","Turtle.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tirtel/","400 products in account","So, first of all, yes, story mode took me around 2,5 hours to complete. That's fairly short for that price, so if you're only interested in that, then it may not be worth your money. But, after spending twice as that, for me it has much more to offer after finishing the story.  There are various challenges and endless modes, both are really fun to do and unlock progressively - the more you play and beat the target score/time/pass the level, the more content you have. This so far keeps me entertained and still makes me play more and improve. For 15 euro I paid for this game, I think I already got my money worth by those 5 hours spent. This is a long review, so I will include a short summary just at the end of it as TL;DR version.\n\nGameplay-wise, this is not your everyday shooter. As you may already know from trailers, time only moves when you move (or generally, perform any action). Some of the story levels felt more like a puzzle - getting the spawn patterns right, knowing which corner to watch for, avoiding those nasty gunshots from ever hitting you. The more you play, the more game mechanics you discover. At very first, I did not know that you can have your time slowed while jumping, but this apparently is a thing and can help with avoiding bullets a lot while still closing the gap to any weapons you need. Melee weapons are a blast, with katana being the strongest (in my opinion) - I personally like to throw it for instakills, slice red guys with almost no hit delay whatsoever (with gunshots, most of guns have a delay between shots to make sure you just don't spam the trigger). I also saw katana blocking bullets, but so far I mostly failed with that one by destroying a weapon I wanted to grab by accidentally throwing katana into it (whoops !). AI is spot-on, although it just shoots in your general direction and may cause some friendly fire on the way, but I find it more as a feature than a flaw.\n\nIt's hard to say more about gameplay  without spoiling too much for the player, so let's get to visuals and performance, both are really great. I'm running the game on fairly low-spec laptop (with Geforce 630m crippling it the most) in 1024x768, and manage to mantain 30fps+ at most moments, while having the graphics at low quality, but that only impacts the shadow quality and Anti-Aliasing, and game still looks great with artstyle of mostly white and red colours used. Just beware, as the game seems to be built with Unity engine, there are some issues with that, which are engine-specific - it seems like changing resolution to one with non-native aspect ratio (4:3, 5:4 etc. if you're running a 16:9 monitor), makes it so there are black borders on the side that are catching any Steam in-game elements to stay in there even if they are not visible, and also making the video smaller overall. I could get used to this, but I figure some people may not, so just be aware of this.\n\nSUMMARY\n-great, innovative gameplay (time moves only when you move, kind of player-centred)\n-flashy, white and red artstyle with text comments about what's going on flashing in front of gameplay (may be obstructive at times, but overall it's spot on IMO), a small epilepsy warning here, as this text is the most "flashy" element in the game.\n-just OK sound, nothing out of this world, nothing that could break game experience\n-very good performance with some Unity engine-specific issues here and there\n-big replay value with challenges and endless modes\n\nIs it worth the money ? If you considered all the stuff mentioned here and still want to just finish story mode and be done with it, then I may not think so. But I think some of those "story mode only" people may still get enough of an impression to still get going with rest of the content this game has to offer. If along what you have seen by trailers and read in reviews is enough for you to think, that you may or will enjoy this game, definitely buy it. You will not regret it.\n\nOh, and lastly:\nSUPER. HOT. SUPER. HOT. SUPER. HOT.","March 19","true","12.4"," 62 of 75 people (83%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","83","62","75","10","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Syntax-Error/recommended/322500/","Syntax-Error","Syntax Error","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Syntax-Error/","1197 products in account","SUPERHOT is an FPS-turned-puzzle game where time moves only when you do, thus allowing you to react and plan out exactly how to defeat each level of "red dudes".  It's a compelling concept and satisfying in several ways, both when you've solved how to react and the ending full speed replay clip of you dodging bullets before throwing a pistol at some dude's face, grabbing the shotgun he dropped in surprise out of mid air and swinging around to unload into two other guys like some sort of FPS savant. There's no single solution to each level but each time you die, you'll find yourself refining your technique based on what went wrong. Graphics are very minimalistic as the screenshots show; everything is white except for the red dudes and interactive items (either a gun, a melee weapon or something you can throw).\n\nThe short campaign (some say ~2hrs, but I suck so it was a little longer) has a retro-technology feel with its cut scenes of text chat rooms, DOS style file hierarchies, etc. Your friend has sent to a new cracked game file, stolen from some company and you enter the world of SUPERHOT. As you play the virtual reality shooter, things start to get weird and the game begins consuming more of your time. The twists the story takes are fairly predictable and there's no real surprises but it's an adequate framework to hang the game play on. Some may criticize the campaign's length but I think that, much longer, and the game play itself would have worn out its welcome. There's also an Endless and Challenge mode and supposedly updates on the way. Of some disappointment is its "Killstagram" feature, supposedly allowing you to upload and share videos of your run throughs but currently impossible to navigate and missing most functions.\n\nSUPERHOT was a fun experience and a new take on the FPS game. Whether it's worth the $25 asking price I'll leave to the buyer but the time spent in the game is solid entertainment. If not now, consider buying it on sale, bundled or whatever.","February 28","true","10.1"," 89 of 119 people (75%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","75","89","119","10","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/322500/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","SUPERHOT is a first person time manipulation game, releasing in February 2016, developed and published by SUPERHOT Team.\n\nThe game play is what makes SUPERHOT, what it is. You play from a first person perspective as you navigate and complete challenges and levels through the single player modes. How you progress will be dictated on how well you are able to manipulate time to your advantage. Time only progresses when you move your character, whether it be simply moving your camera angel, or by taking a step forward, time will go on. As soon as you stop, time will freeze, allowing you to plot your next move accordingly. Throughout the game you will gain access to different weapons in the form of shotguns, machine guns and samurai swords. These all play key parts in the levels you find them and are often the key to completion.  Whilst most levels are actually pretty short in terms of the content available, playing them out in the slowed down time frame can mean you are sometimes acting out the scene for up to five minutes. Once you complete the level by eliminating all of the enemies, you will get to watch back the scene in full speed, allowing you to marvel at the spectacle you have just created; most of the time, it is something of pure beauty to watch as your character glides through the level chopping off heads, getting headshots, and perfectly catching enemies off guard.\n\nGraphically, SUPERHOT is very clean, almost medical like art style. The whites, blacks and reds all contrast well against each other. The game runs on the Unity engine so the fidelity of the animations, and character models are all really high quality, with very high production values found right the way through the audio side of the game with top notch narration and sound effects.\n\nThis game is hard, but you soon get to grips with the game play and you can often conquer most levels after a handful of attempts of just correcting your own mistakes. I personally really enjoyed the trial and error aspect of this game, as the reset time for each failure was quick and snappy, allowing you to get straight back into the action after messing up. On top of the game’ s story mode, SUPERHOT, also includes an endless mode – this is where you have literally an endless amount of enemies come at you. We also have a challenge mode that will basically replay the single player missions but give you additional certain rules and hurdles to overcome at the same time too.\n\nI managed to finish the single player story mode to SUPERHOT in just under two hours, which was a little short for my liking, but where you will get the most mileage and replay value out of SUPERHOT, is the challenge mode and endless mode; you will be able to get countless hours of entertainment out of both of these game modes if you enjoy the gameplay enough. I would have liked to see a longer story mode, but we can’t have everything I guess.\n\nSUPERHOT is definitely one of the surprises to come out of 2016. It may be priced a little on the high end given the short story mode, but it can be almost made up by the two extra modes. I’d personally recommend the game even at the regular price of £17.99. The game also has VR support which will just be amazing to see how it plays out on that format.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

It is extremely fun to play around with, and can certainly be a game you can play with friends to see who can do the coolest things, but $25 is a bit too much for what is being bought.\n\nFor one, Superhot's main story is only about 2 hours long. Even with a dozen retries on some levels, I still completed it in under 2 hours. That is quite ridiculous, as the replayable content doesn't go very far after that either. The only modes available following the main story are Endless Mode and some Challenge modes. You can probably squeeze a few extra hours out of those if you're in love with the game, but other than that... you won't be playing this for long, and as such, you definitely won't want to cough up $25 for a 3-4 hour experience in a video game.\n\nIs Superhot worth playing? Yes. Like I said, it is exhilarating to play. It's an experience I've never had before, and would love to have again in a different aesthetic. Maybe a more realistic one. If you can buy Superhot on sale, go for it. But at it's current asking price, I just can't recommend the title.","February 26","false","3.7"," 156 of 237 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","156","237","5","0"

As i can say, it’s right. But this is my opinion; you should make your own picture.\n\nThis game is like Bullet-Time of Max Payne only all the time.\nTime is standing still, only if you move like aiming, jumping, walking, shooting, throwing and punching, then the time will continue.\n\nMenu is like the old DOS with Norton-Commander. You should check everything, there are some hidden gems. =)\n\nYou have to start with Story mode. If you think it is easy because of the stopped time, you completely wrong.\nYou need to move tactical, one wrong move and you are dead. There is no Health bar or Health regeneration and there is no need for it. Every hit kills you instantly but same for enemies except punching, there you need two or three hits.\nI needed around three hours to complete Story-Mode, but I think if you rush and you’re lucky you can beat it in one hour. I got killed like 1000 times and had to restart some levels. After that, new Modes get unlocked, “SUPERHOT.exe” disappears and some other programs will be downloaded. (level.exe, endless.exe and challenges.exe – I guess it’s self-explanatory) So there will be enough to do, even after the short story.\nAfter every level or if you die, you can see your action in real-time and if you think its look awesome you can upload it to https://killstagram.com/u/MinusNull815\n\nLevel-Design is:\nEnvironment:  White/Bright Grey\nEnemies: Blood Red\nItems/Weapons: Black/Onyx/Dark Grey\nNothing much to say, little level where, I can move free and enemies spawning in some corners who try me to kill. :D\n\nSound isn’t much, shooting sound and if I kill an enemy there is a rattle noise.

It's a bit of a shame that Steam reviews only have a thumbs up or thumbs down, not any sort of in-between score.\nI expect that fans of the game will downvote the hell out of this review for not recommending it.\n\nTruth is I'm a huge fan of this game. Despite a couple technical hiccups (which may not be actual bugs, given the nature of the game), the game is ridiculously fun and stylish as hell. Though SUPERHOT has really only one gameplay gimmick, it never grew stale. Killing a room full of red guys in impossible situations never got boring, and the game's narrative actually kept me very engaged.\n\nSince time only moves when you do, the game feels very far away from any other first person shooter made before it. It's impossible to run-and-gun, you need to carefully plan your steps to dodge deadly projectiles, while also aiming carefully and lining up those perfect shots; with so little ammo, you can't afford to be careless. It's the freshest breath of air an FPS fan has been able to inhale for the last long while.\n\nSo why am I not recommending this incredible game?\n\nThe price.\n\n\nI've defended games like Jazzpunk and McPixel, even Undertale, when faced with the criticism of a game being too short. I truly believe it's about the experience. But SUPERHOT has pushed my limit.\n$35 Canadian dollars for a game you can potentially beat in a few hours?\nIt's not quite worth it.\n\nSUPERHOT is amazing. But $35 is a very steep price for a quick game. I suppose there is replay value in the Endless Mode, trying to do sections more efficiently, and trying to uncover the game's secrets. But really, as excellent and fun as it may be, there is no variation in gameplay.\n\nTons of AAA titles boast campaigns that barely register 6 hours and they cost twice as much, I know this. But, having paid a much smaller price for games I felt carried more weight, I still don't think SUPERHOT has a justifiable price.\nIf it came down in a sale or something I'd push this game onto every person within reach and earshot of me.\n\n\nSUPERHOT is an incredibly creative and well-crafted game.\nIt just costs too much right now.","February 26","false","4.2"," 106 of 163 people (65%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","65","106","163","6","0"

The mechanic is unique, and fun, and the game is overall enjoyable. There are a few niggling problems though that force me to rate this a "not recommend":\n\nThe mechanic, while fun, is badly implemented. The first thing you're told upon starting is that "time moves only when you do" - well, no, that's false, time moves much slower when you're not moving, but it still moves, enough to get you killed repeatedly in the later levels if you're not paying very close attention. This leads to some downright infuriating moments.\n\nSpeaking of infuriating moments, your hitbox is a lot bigger than you'd expect. You try to pull off some Matrix-level bullet sidestepping and die to a shoulder bullet.\n\nIt's unoptimized, which in this day and age, is unforgivable. The graphics here are very primitive (on purpose), so when the framerate starts chugging, there's very little to point the finger at other than bad code.\n\nThe game is *shockingly* short. You can finish the story mode in a couple hours, less if you're good, and that leaves nothing but a bunch of time attack/speedrun (read: ancillary) stuff.\n\nThe story hints dropped in the prototype were completely thrown out the window.\n\nTrying a bit too hard to break the fourth wall.\nI kickstarted this title for $14.99 and expected something much more substantial. Look at my playtime: 2.1 hours, and I've finished the story, gotten half the achievements, and started to dig into the challenge stuff before getting bored.\n\nVerdict: Buy it on sale, but absolutely not at its current price. This is a $5-10 game at best. $25 is highway robbery.","February 27","false","2.6"," 97 of 148 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","97","148","2","0"

Wait for 15$ or preferably less on a sale.\n\nSuperhot, as a game concept, is really good. A first person shooter where time only passes when you move. This trick lets you weave in and out of enemies and bullets, letting you do a lot of movements and actions that let you feel like a pro stuntman. A small variety of weapons and throwable objects give you plenty of options to choose when dealing with oncoming bullets. Do you jump and dodge? Take cover? Do you block the bullet with an object? Cause the enemy to do friendly fire? You are free to deal with situations as you see fit, so you can express a lot of your personal style in your actions. A well integrated replay feature lets you share your choices with the world.\n\nIf that was all that were in the game, similar to the 2013 prototype, along with plenty of levels and a point beyond "just killing red dudes", there'd be no complaints.\nFrustratingly though, it feels like the developers spent more time over the past two years making useless content and coming up with a dumb narrative and making it all fit in with some 90s IRC/hacker aesthetic. This wouldn't be such a big deal if it wasn't constantly bashing you on the head with this to the point where it gets in the way of your game.\n\nA lot of levels are large but enemies spawn in only a small area, making most of the space functionally useless. Only a few enemies spawn at a time, so a lot of the time you are just waiting for enemies to spawn and come to you, wasting a lot of time over the course of the game. Enemies don't have any variable action, most of the time they stand and shoot at you, or run up to you for a melee attack. There is no variety in enemy type, only the weapon they carry differs.\n\nThis is all bundled up with the lousy text menu interface, 99% of which is empty content. The menu has all these tantalizing options like "Apps" and "Games".....but there's nothing there of substance. They contribute nothing to the game, and nothing gets added to them later. Add in a snarky narrative of "the system" and I really feel like I'm being made fun of by the game (and by extension, the developers) for trying to play it.\n\nWouldn't it have been great to have some more variety in the gameplay? At times you can really get into a killing flow as you progress through one of the areas, but the moment you acheive that high, the enemies stop spawning and the level is over. What if the level kept going? What if there were more interactive objects? Switches? Keys? Anything? The 2013 tech demo gave you at least a tiny sense of progression when you killed the CEO and jumped out the window to your doom, only for your death to be averted at the last moment. Here, there's no twist or change of course. Levels and battles are isolated affairs. Any sort of experience you may have had is wiped away immediately, and it's just on to the next repetitive encounter. In the end, you just feel "What's the point?"\n\nIf that is what the devs were aiming for, then I simply don't find it fun. Superhot COULD be a great game, but at this time there is little actual content to it. It's unfortunate the developers chose this path in the past two years of development, but it is what it is. Don't buy it at 25$.","March 19","false","30.9"," 150 of 239 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","150","239","3","8"

The core gameplay is great, but there are a lot of problems. If you like the demo and would like to play with variations on it on ~25 levels, go for it. An extra gameplay mechanic gets chucked in halfway to spice things up a little.\n\nIt's a lot like Portal in that it's a small, short puzzlish game with an excellent, original atmosphere and style, but it's nowhere near as polished.\nStory is compelling and fun, but only 2 hours long. Half of the challenge modes are good, half are garbage, there's about 12 in total. Endless mode is fun but you don't have any rewards or goals. Time-trial mode is the same. What sealed the deal for me continuing to play was the secret-finding exploration mode.\n\nIt's fun to start up and play one or two levels for 5mins.\nAdd a level editor and proper way to share them and this would be solid gold.\n\n~~~ Here's all the problems that should be easily fixed ~~~\n\nEndless modes and time-trial modes are lack-luster; it doesn't compare scores against friends or give rankings/grades. Stupidly, the first ~1.5 seconds of in-game time occur with the loading screen still up, so you have to begin blindly to get the best times, not that there is anything motivating you to improve your time past the single goal they give. Endless mode is fun, but the game gives you no milestones to aim for - all of the unlockables (timed endless modes) are unlocked by total kills ever rather than top score.\n\nIrredeemable bugs:\nThere's a minigame that doesn't stop the music on exiting, leaving it looping over itself and forcing a restart. Some achievements are bugged, including giving me the "complete all time trials" achievement when I only did 5 of them. Worst of all, completion of the last level you do before quitting IS RANDOMLY NOT SAVED SO YOU HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN.\n\nGraphics:\nThe brightness can be a bit difficult to look at sometimes.\nAnimations are janky, which is a bit weird because they literally only have one animated model.\nIt is also somehow jittery at times? VSync is broken and doesn't lock to 60fps. Level 21 is very laggy for no apparent reason.\nSettings menu is pitiful, you have about 3 graphics options and can't change key bindings.\n\nGameplay:\nThrown objects will very occasionally bounce off or pass through enemies for no apparent reason.\nThrown objects move faster than bullets. If you shoot and immediately throw a gun, the bullet hits the gun.\nI don't know why they don't have time completely stop, it makes for a much more precise experience.\nWhen you land from a jump the screen gets a pointless and annoying/disorienting shock effect.\nYou can't really tell how much ammo your gun has left, reducing your ability to plan stuff.\nThe gun reload animation is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you can't tell how long it has left until you can fire again.\nThe end-of-level replays aren't quite satisfying enough, they're still too slow.\nIf an enemy breaks something too close to themselves they get stunned, which is a bit lame.","February 28","false","12.5"," 55 of 78 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","55","78","2","3"

I'm not saying that the length is a problem because it isn't; one of the best games ever made is the original Portal and that was barely 2 hours. However, Portal was priced correctly, and while it had a story it simply informed the gameplay and wasn't obtrusive. The character felt well fleshed out and comical, while the narrator in SuperHot is just obnoxious. Every time I was pulled away from the radically fun gameplay, I was annoyed. The "story" to this game is it's greatest downfall and I genuinely wish that it was simply a collection of mission with a fun gameplay gimick.","April 3","false","1.9"," 135 of 221 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","135","221","2","4"

In the beginning, you talk to your "friend" at the beginning and he "hands you the files" for Superhot. Who this "friend" is and how you know them is apparently not important enough for further detail in the story. Then "they" find out you've been playing this game and shut you down. Who "they" are is apparently not important enough for further detail in the story. After a few confrontations with "them", "they" eventually take you in, you kill more people, game over. The story mode can be completed and the game mastered within the span of a few short hours. Even if the story mode of the game is more of a training mode so you can learn the game mechanics before playing Endless Mode and challenges, it should make more sense and try to explain what is happening in the story, and should go into depth as to what exactly is happening instead of being a shallow, self-indulged fps. You might have found that paragraph to be fairly repetitive. That wasn't an accident, it was a metaphor.\n\nThe idea of constant bullet time is interesting, but honestly I wouldn't pay $35(CDN) for this game if I were to go back and know how quickly I would get bored of it. You can get a similar affect by playing GTA V in slow motion and 1st person. I've played Superhot for a total of 10 hours, 4 of which it was running idly, and another 1 during which I was playing Endless Mode and challenges.\n\nThe Endless Mode is self-explanatory, you play an endless run against enemies until you die. The challenges aren't all that interesting either, as the only new feature the different challenge modes incorporate is an added timer or a hinderance to gameplay, ex. only (weapon) can be used, you can only throw weapons instead of fire them, etc.\n\nThe target audience is people that use VR headsets, which is accentuated by your character wearing one whenever the PC's home is visited. This target will probably make more sense when the game is VR-compatible. But no matter what's to come, this game is currently a showpiece for a game mechanic the dev team thought of, nothing more, and is not worth its price tag in the slightest.","March 2","false","10.0"," 69 of 107 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","69","107","3","0"

It has such a novel premise I'm surprised it hasn't been done before.\n\nIn this game, time slows down to a near standstill when you stop moving. And progresses forwards when you move and when you fire. The development team implemented this very well. Bullets fly through the air and are very easy to spot among the white level textures. The game has this very Hotline Miami feel to it. You can throw your guns at enemies to stun them, you can throw objects to block bullets, and you can even shoot bullets in midair as they fly towards you. For a game that should feel slow and calculated, it feels very fast paced and rhythmic.\n\nStylistically the game is very interesting. The UI resembles a DOS based operating system. Enemies resemble low poly characters from old video games. At the same time the environments look very crisp and everything stands out very well. If you're a fan of films like Tron you'll definitely like this game.\n\nHowever, all that being said the game is not perfect, and it's very hard for me to recommend. For the 25$ asking price there's very little content and you can mostly beat it in a handful of hours. The level design also maintains the same white sterile aesthetic and doesn't have that much variety to it. While the core gameplay is pretty solid it appeals to a certain kind of player. It appeals to the kind of player that wants to play a level over and over to try and achieve a perfect run.\n\nIf you're that kind of player I do recommend this game a lot. But to everyone else I'd say wait a little for the dev to either create a level editor or lower the price.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=632618272","February 25","true","2.2"," 52 of 78 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","52","78","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/supersrsurl/recommended/322500/","supersrsurl","Tommy Wiseau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/supersrsurl/","301 products in account","Superhot is possibly the most disappointing game I’ve played so far this year. It’s got a great premise with it’s time bending matrix style mechanics, but to be perfectly honest with you that’s all it’s got going for it.\nNow for those of you unfamiliar with the title, Superhot is a first person shooter where time moves only as you do… remember those fight sequences in 300… now imagine them with guns and you’ve got superhot – a never before seen melting pot of both strategic and twitch based shooting.\n\nNow of course bullet time isn’t really a new thing and over the years we’ve been inundated with enough Max Payne and F.E.A.R clones to be sick of the concept. However, it’s never really had any use beyond doing John Woo’esque dives to look cool and break up the otherwise monotonous game loop. Heck if you’re name’s Dereck and you enjoy filing tax returns you could probably get through Max Payne without using bullet time once.\n\nThe difference with superhot is that the games mechanics actually force you to choreograph some really impressive stunts just to stay alive. It’s a bit like hotline Miami where getting hit once causes instant death forcing the player to make split second decisions to stand a chance in a firefight. Infact it’s a lot like hotline Miami with throwable objects used to stun enemies and block bullets, and very similar melee and projectile weapons.\n\nThe only real difference in terms of gameplay is hotline’s top down all-seeing perspective compared with Superhot’s much more limited first person view, a limitation in theory meant to balance out the bullet time… In practice I’ve been shot in the back countless times by enemies behind me. It feels cheap and annoying and it’s one of the major problems I have with the gameplay.\n\nIt also feels like the dev’s either didn’t know or didn’t care about this problem when they created their replay system, kilstagram. The idea behind it is that, after you’ve cleared each level, you get to watch a replay of you dispatching your enemies in real time which you get the option to upload to various social media sites. You know because all those nightclub photographs you got tagged in weren’t enough to show people how much fun you were having without them.\nAnyway on paper it sounds like a pretty cool idea – the chance for you to show off your Wachowskii’esque bullet time skills but in reality the played back footage looks more like that of a twitchy counterstrike player as you keep glancing behind you to make sure you don’t get flanked causing the camera to spin back and forth making it headache inducing to watch… actually that does sound a lot like a wachowskii film.\n\nAaaand that’s it… well at least in terms of mechanics… and to be honest with you it all feels very lackluster. For all it borrows from Hotline Miami, I kinda wish they’d taken more. At the moment there simply isn’t any reward for combos or difficult kills like headshots, there isn’t even any music in the background which makes it feel more like an early access title than anything else. But I guess that’s the kind of aesthetic they were going for – everything in the game is made up of plain textures with a really minimalist color scheme.  And it also ties in with the story the dev’s wanted to tell… that’s right the dev’s actually managed to come up with a story to tie all of this together, though as you’ll see it’s so phoned in and half-arsed it feels more like it’s there for the sake of having a story.\n\nRemember Pony island? Good Neither does the guy that wrote this drivel.  Instead of being a story within Superhot’s universe, it’s a story about playing superhot. You start off the game looking at a dos style operating system when suddenly you get an instant message from a friend sending you a file titled “superhot.exe”. After playing a few levels, the system detects you and it pans out exactly as you’d expect it to be with the system trying to stop the player and the player finding loopholes and backdoor routes to evade the system.  The problem with the narrative is that it does not compliment the gameplay – you could replace the shooting segments with Tetris and the story would still work.\nIt’s a prime example of what people who like to use big words to sound clever call Ludonarative Dissonance, where the gameplay and story don’t match and the exposition just feels like a hindrance to the actual meat of the game.\nWhilst I can kind of get over the mediocre storyline, the thing I find unforgivable is the 2-hour campaign length. That’s right, you can beat the game in a single sitting! Now I’m not saying all short games are bad, in fact titles like Portal have been praised for not overstaying their welcome with their shot length. The problem with Superhot being so short is that instead of leaving me wanting more, I just feel unsatisfied by the finished product.\n\nTo rub it in, the dev’s have had a working prototype since 2013 which featured quite a few of the levels that ended up in the full game, most of which was made in a few days at a game jam. It can’t be so hard to make a level that the team could only pump out 20 or so short levels in 3 years! Especially with backing and e3 coverage by both Sony and Microsoft. To have the balls to demand 17 quid (that’s the equivalent of 3 copies of Undertale) for a game that can be beaten in an afternoon is a little bit insulting. Granted there’s more to it than just the campaign, there’s also the arena mode where you have to fend off endless waves of enemies which gets boring after about an hour and there’s the challenge mode where you’ll have to play the campaign meeting certain conditions (for example only using the katana). Like the story, both these additional modes feel last minute and tacked on.\n\nThe best analogy I have for the game as a whole is to imagine the first chapter of id software’s doom being sold full price. Back in its heyday in the 90’s nobody had ever seen anything like DOOM and I can safely say the gameplay of superhot is just as innovative. However, whilst the game that’s there is relatively enjoyable, albeit flawed, it just ends before the more interesting experimental stages (like in the 3rd act of doom) get to be shown. Ultimately I can’t really recommend picking up the game unless it’s heavily discounted and, to go with the analogy, the game receives a John Romero out of 10. It showed a lot of promise in it’s early days as a prototype, started getting full of itself at e3 and then ultimately ♥♥♥♥ the bed with one fell daikatanaesque swoop.\n","March 29","false","7.1"," 35 of 51 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","35","51","3","2"

Throughout the day, and through running arguments with fans of the game, I have come to ask "Was I wrong about SuperHot? Did I simply not appreciate its genius? Have I been letting a bad experience partially related to mobile hardware ruin my opinion of an otherwise sound game?"\n\nThe answer is no.\n\nThe reason I cannot reccomend superhot is simple. It is a lazy product, especially at its base pricetag of 25 dollars.\n\n- Combat is one dimensional. Your arsenal consists of 3 samey guns and a melee attack, to be used on one basic enemy type, using two AI scripts. All guns shoot slow bullets with overlarge hitboxes that kill enemies wherever they hit them. Combat itself just boils down "click on the nearest enemy." There's no strategy, risk/reward, or anything else, because the only thing that makes enemies remotely dangerous is proximity.\n\n- The presentation is bland and empty. While visually functional, which is extremely important and should be lauded, there was zero meaningful artistic effort put into this game. Yes, the polygon men shatter and ragdoll nicely, but what does this mean to the narrative, the world? Nothing. The story as well is a vapid copypasta of late 90's cyber-angst so lazy I quit 60% of the way through the game and just looked it up on wikipedia. I was still disappointed.\n\n- The playtesting was lackluster. Bullet on bullet collissions, a cool idea on paper, happen so often they become a frustration. I didn't even play a full hour and had it happen to me 5 times. It happened so often that I started to hate it happening, and that's too often. If enemies were actively shooting my bullets down, I might credit it as some modicum of AI intelligence, but no, all were just stupid accidents resulting from center-of-mass shots on enemies that were shooting back. But if this is bad, then level hitboxing is even worse. I had a bullet disappear in midair because it hit an invisible corner, and it was a perfect shot too. You're telling me they spent two and a half years on barely 150 minutes worth of content and couldn't polish the collision?\n\nReally, at the end of the day, it doesn't feel like SuperHotTeam even tried when they made this game. Two and a half years ago, SuperHot was a proof-of-concept demo being debuted at 7 day FPS Challenge. Today, it is still a proof-of-concept demo that now goes for 25 dollars. Maybe when they decide to make an actual game it'll be worth it, but for now take your money and go buy a game from a developer who cares.","February 26","false","0.7"," 69 of 112 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","69","112","3","18"

Then imagine that when you move, the rest of the world moves.  Granted, if you don't move at all things are still moving, but very slowly.  So slow, in fact, that you can potentially dodge bullets, cut enemies to shreds before they can move, toss guns into the face of oncoming attackers and pick up their weapon in mid-air and shoot them with it... all before the guy behind them even has a chance to aim at you.  But, take a step without being aware or look around too much, and you'll likely end up getting clobbered from a direction you didn't even know was a threat.\n\nThis game is great on so many different levels that it's really hard to cover everything.  I was a kickstarter backer and have played the game on various levels of completion and none of it was ever enough to quench my curiousity about the plot and, of course, the gameplay.\n\nYou basically have hundreds of ways to play through each level.  Choose to go at it fisticuffs for some additional challenge or destroy everyone with headshots.  Just about any way you can figure it out, that's going to work.  Except, of course, the ways it won't.  Which, you'll find out later in the game, become pretty linear... brutally so.  However, keeping your wits about you can get you through most levels without even a retry.\n\nAnd... visit the chatroom (GGchat).  There is more going on there that there appears to be at first... including some hints for different levels.\n\nI definitely recommend this game for anyone that has a computer!\n\nAnd, don't forget...

I completed all the achievements in the game and I still am playing it. It's very unique in its gameplay and that's where the game really shines for me.\n\nIf you really only care about the story in a game, then this game is probably not ideal, due to its hefty price tag and short campaign but if you play video games for gameplay, I suggest trying this game.

I wasn't super hyped for this game so I went in with what I'd say fairly low expectations. But now that I've fully completed the game, obviously barring challenges and endless mode, I can confidently say this game is the worst waste of time and money ever. About half way through my 2 hour absolute thrill ride (/s) I was already totally fed up of the text simulator that half the game basically is. If I took out all mandatory text scenes in this game it'd be little more than an hour long glorified flash game. Now, the game does offer neat little stuff like 'secrets' hidden in what I presume to be every level, but this has not interested me enough at all to keep me playing, or keep it in my library for that matter.\n\nGunplay is exactly how you'd expect. The whole 'time moves when you move thing' is pretty neat at times. I'm not going to lie, the game definitely has it's entertaining moments, for about 30 minutes, then it becomes frustrating. Hotswitching is fun for the what 5? 6? levels I was allowed to use it in, shame it was introduced too late. The level design is either sixty or total nought, with some levels making you purposefully die so you can play it again or some levels making you make mistakes because you just want it to be over.\n\nThe story is not particularly engaging, no spoilers, but it becomes GLARINGLY obvious what you're going to have to end up doing very early on in the game. The story is only advanced by compulsory text sections, which can range from short interactions to taking way, WAY too long. The large flashing text is an effective "cool" little feature for a while, then it starts to try way too hard to become intimidating and overbearing, which it fails at by being too frequent and 'obvious'? I guess?\n\nRight, one more thing. I'm almost certain this is intentional, and somehow the secrets may be involved? Or maybe I missed things. BUT, the game has an OVERBEARING AWFUL LACK OF CHOICE. I seriously get the vibe the devs were going for, but man, is this game linear. It's painfully restrictive, if you're the curious type who tries to look for every way out of being told what to do, this game will be little more than a masochistic experience for you. Again, this may be all irrelevant with game elements which I have not explored.\n\nUltimately, not a good experience. Forgive my ignorance, but I honestly don't know what the devs were doing all those years. If you're a big fan of short games, and LOVE the mechanic of time moving when you do and are willing to play the game well into the challenges and endless mode, go right ahead, seriously, you will have a blast. But to the average player? I wouldn't. The game is good, but very slow paced, and the (unskippable!) text sections go on way too long.","February 25","false","2.0"," 96 of 165 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","96","165","5","0"

You get plopped into various locales and gotta kill all the red dudes. The hook is unless you make a move time advances extremely slowly - which makes this into a "puzzle fps" of some sort.\n\nYou can shoot of course, punch, grab and throw stuff (also jump). One bullet is enough to kill you or the enemy. Each action you take advances time to a certain degree. Moving advances it proportionally, throwing and shooting takes abit of time and grabbing a weapon for example takes the longest.\n\nYou face two dudes, one with a weapon. Next to you is a bottle. You grab the bottle. The armed dude fires. You dodge the bullet then throw the bottle at him. Meanwhile the unarmed guy advances, you punch him once. The bottle hits the armed guy, he recoils and his weapon flies towards you. You grab it out of the air and shoot them both. You hear a gunshot and turn around. You throw the weapon at the bullet hovering in front of you and the new dude fires again. Next to you is a pipe but is there enough time to grab it...\n\nStuff like that. One of the unlockable extra modes is a total timestop which allows for even more wacky matrix escapades.\n\nGraphics are stylised and functional and it fits the game (the menues and such are retro ascii stuff, abit tired schtick but good enough and theres alot of funny useless extras in there). Same with the sound - dont think this has any music (in the main game) but the menues have bleeps and bloops and ingame theres the appropriate swishes and swooshes for time dilated matrix stuff.\n\nThe main "story" game is rather short but theres a few challenge modes (speedrunning, katana only and such) and endless arenas.\n\nFollowing that the only thing one could object to would be the price, but considering all the sorts of garbage one throws money at nowadays its really not that much for this fine polished product id think.\n\nSUPER Recommended","May 2","true","7.0"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

To play the game, you will have to download the exe. file and upon launching it, you will be killing SUPERHOT red opponents.\n\nSuperhot is a First Person Shooter with a time manipulation mechanism which make this game really fun to play.  You will be able to play a short story mode of approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes. When you successfully complete the story, you will unlock the endless and challenge modes.  The challenge mode is the story mode but you can only use a specific weapon all the way through and the first weapon is the Katana. In the endless mode you have to kill as many opponents as possible before your fall.\n\nI really like the gameplay of SUPERHOT with the time manipulation mechanism, the whitish compact levels and the unmissable red opponents. Sometimes you will be harmed with a gun, shotgun, machine gun, katana, or maybe with nothing but your faithful hands, which can become tricky!  What you have to do is to dismiss all the red combatants to clear the level but remember, they too have the weapons mentioned above. As you spawn, you might or might not see one or several enemies. When you start moving, the enemies will move too, and will start shooting at you straight away. If you are fired upon and stop moving you will see the bullets coming at you in slow motion. In terms of ammunition they have a limitation for all firearms and sometimes the only way to stunt and acquire your opponent’s weapons is to throw your empty weapon towards them. If left with your bare hands, try to look around for tools or utensils to throw at them instead. On some occasions, you will be able to use the “hotswitch” ability, which is the ability to switch from your body to the enemy in front of you.  To be honest with you, I am very surprised how fast and frustrating some levels are. For me, it was the elevator levels where you have to clear three enemies armed with guns in the lift, with two other guys waiting with shotguns on the other side of the door. That was SUPERHOT AND SUPER HARD!\n\nGraphically the game looks good and the animations are well done. I personally find the story very short but the endless and challenge modes give you good re-playability.  I would have expected more content for the asking price.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great concept with compact levels\n-	Fun game to play\n-	Endless and challenge modes\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Very Short Story mode\n-	Needs more content, in my opinion\n\nSUPERHOT is a fun first person shooter in well-designed compact levels.\n\n7.5/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

It's available for free on the Superhot website, and really is an accurate reflection of the final game. I tried it, and disliked it, but bought the game anyway, thinking maybe the final version would be better.\nThe hitbox for the player is very misleading, and makes it very difficult to judge where you can move to avoid a bullet. Enemy ai is bland and predictable. The real problem of the game comes in with how enemies spawn. If you have yet to memorize where they'll come from, then when they spawn in already shooting, they WILL kill you.\nThe game's short length, of around 2 hours + challenges, is perfect for its awful story, but is lackluster for a $20 release. There is little variety in weapons and opportunities during gameplay.\nIn addition, there may be a small amount of bugs, but it's difficult to tell when the game's presentation is the glitchy style.\nIf you like the prototype, you really will like the full game (maybe wait for a sale, though).\nIf you expect another Hotline Miami, don't buy this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LuxuryIsMe/recommended/322500/","LuxuryIsMe","Lᴇʙᴇɴsᴍᴜ̈ᴅᴇ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LuxuryIsMe/","377 products in account","Alright, lets talk about the unique first person shooter that many people have been eagerly awaiting, SUPERHOT.\nI'm going to break this down into a few sections, because i'm genuinely eager to convince people that this is a game worth buying. I was not supplied a code by developers, nor do I ever write reviews on Steam, but this game honestly compelled me to do just that.\n\nFirst, lets talk about the plot. Without giving too much away, especially because there isn't really much to give away beyond whats left to interpretation, SUPERHOT is a game about a game. That doesn't sound too original at first, what with this new trend of metafiction we've been seeing in indie games like Undertale or Pony Island, but this game is just a little bit different. You find yourself playing a faceless protagonist. No, really, he has no face, nor does anybody else in SUPERHOT. Not much is revealed about the protagonist, or any of the "characters" for that matter, however what we do learn, aside from spoilers that i'll leave out, is that the character is a gamer in what is presumably the near future, because it seems that much of the gaming world is hooked on VR. SUPERHOT is just that, a VR game. However it is sent to you by an online acquaintance with the stipulation that it is a cracked and unfinished game that was stumbled upon.\n\nLets talk about GAMEPLAY (10/10)\nI'm going to give SUPERHOT's gameplay a 10/10, because I really can't see anything that they could have changed or added to the gameplay that wouldn't feel unnecessary. SUPERHOT's gameplay really is right where it should be. There are two key gameplay mechanics in SUPERHOT, the first one being what the whole game really revolves around gameplay wise.\n\nTIME PROGRESSES ONLY WHEN YOU MOVE.\n\nThis truly is a genious mechanic, and this is what makes SUPERHOT stand out. You often find that in any FPS you see only the highly skilled players pull off intricate plays that seem deliberate and smooth. In SUPERHOT, thanks to its slow-mo style, you can carefully plan where every bullet will land, when every poorly aimed martini glass will make contact with your foe's faces, and my personal favourite, staring at your screen with frustration as you come to the realization that the second you unfreeze time the volley of bullets in front of you will turn you into swiss cheese and you'll have to restart the level.\n\nThe second mechanic in SUPERHOT is "HOTSWITCHING", which lets you switch the body that you are occupying with that of any opponent you hold E on, with a cooldown of course. This is introduced a little while into the game, unlike the slow-mo mechanic, however it really helps when the levels start getting harder. It really adds a whole other dimension to the game being able to essentially warp behind your opponents, put yourself on the other end of a stray bullet coming straight towards you, or just position yourself a little bit better. This is another amazing mechanic, and although its been one visited in other games, I think this game got it right.\n\nLastly, being able to pull off some of the things you can, like grabbing guns out of midair, slicing bullets in half with katanas, or releasing a flurry of, well, basically any loose object you can find at your foes really makes you feel good when playing.\n\nOverall, the gameplay in SUPERHOT feels extremely smooth, and there is nothing more satisfying than watching all of your meticulously planned actions come to life in the realtime recap that happens at the end of each level, all to the wonderful sound of the all too familiar SUPER. HOT. SUPER. HOT. SUPER. HOT. SUPER. HOT.\n\nMoving on to GRAPHICS (N/A / 10/10)\nIll cut this one short to say that this is either a 10/10, or an N/A. Simply because the effect the developer wanted to achieve was executed perfectly. That being, however, because it is a low poly game and graphics don't really come into play. Personally, I might be a bit biased because i'm a huge fan of low poly artwork, but I love the approach they took to SUPERHOT's visuals. Unless you have a seething hatred for low poly models, i'm sure you will too.\n\nNext, SOUND (Errrr, good ambience?)\nMuch like graphics, to be honest there isn't much to say here. SUPERHOT utilizes three sounds frequently in its game. The ambient clicking of the protagonists keyboard, the whirring of electronics in the background, and of course, SUPER. HOT.\n\nLastly, DIFFICULTY (9/10)\nThe first thing that comes to mind when I try to eloquently word an explanation of SUPERHOT's difficulty is that it is extremely reminiscent of Hotline Miami. For those of you who have played the Hotline Miami games, you're probably already pulling your own hair out at the thought. For those of you who haven't, it isn't unnecessarily hard, but you definitely do get that signiture feeling of frustration every time you get shot from behind, mess up a sequence, or get punched by an enemy you "killed". SUPERHOT is definitely challenging at times, but it's just the right kind of challenging, and after you get over a couple of waves of frustration it will absolutely leave you wanting more.\n\nThat being said, if you're Neo from the matrix you shouldn't experience much trouble completing SUPERHOT.\n\nI'm going to end this review by talking a little bit about why I personally feel that SUPERHOT is worth its hefty $30 price tag, even though I had the good fortune of pre-ordering the game for a fraction of that. SUPERHOT may not be as long as a triple A release, and it may not have the replay value of a competitive online game, but it absolutely leaves you with a memorable experience, and if you like it like I did, you may just find that you'll put a lot of time into completing challenges, sifting through all the little side content and secrets, and playing endless mode. I have only dipped slightly into the content that lies beyond the main storyline, yet I am already very fond of the 15 minutes or so I spent watching the chat room characters talk to each other. Ironically enough, thats probably the most character development in SUPERHOT.\n\nIf you can afford it, I strongly suggest that you buy this game. It's fun, it's original, it has replay value to an extent, and it truly is the most innovative shooter i've played in years.","February 25","true","16.9"," 50 of 83 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","50","83","0","3"

With a cool way to play the game, time moves forward, when your character moves. What could go wrong with this game? Well how freaking short the main story is. I finished main story in less than an hour. There is only ONE enemy type to fight against, 4 different weapons to use (plus throwable weapons which act the same).\n\nSure there are challenge mode, but for example with the "Ninja Challenge" which is Katana only, you repeat the same missions, but this time with some specific rules. When you learn how the game works and find the best tactic, you have nothing new to learn. For most of the time, you can hide in spot A and wait for enemies to come and then steal their weapons.\n\nWhat this game needs is more interesting enemies, more interesting weapons and more interesting skills. This game lack content and it is NOT worth over 20€. Not by far. You can buy The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth and DLC for ~25€ and it gives you hunreds EVEN thousands of hours gameplay material. This game doesn't.\n\nSUPER....HOT.... is Not.... Worth....

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinoracha/recommended/322500/","dinoracha","Dinoracha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinoracha/","426 products in account","I’m all for innovation when it comes to blending genres to create something new and noteworthy, and SuperHot’s early prototype certainly had me intrigued when I first saw it. Never mind the strange, unseen narrator who references the game’s title ad nauseum or the shattering of red people like panes of glass, it was the nature of having a partial control of time while dodging bullets and dispensing your own in a slick, effortlessly stylish manner that sold me. The final product does deliver on its original proof of concept, but not without a few issues making things needlessly bothersome near the end.\n\nStand still and time moves at a crawl. Move or attack and time moves normally. This is the fundamental gimmick of SuperHot; making your character feel like a nigh-godly action hero who dispatches enemies effortlessly… Except your character is made of even more fragile glass than the enemies. Enemies are killed instantly when they’re hit by a bullet, struck with a melee weapon or in seldom cases meet their demise via the environment, the exception being a three hit punch combo. You on the other hand can’t even take one punch without falling to the ground and dying horribly. Thus each level requires a chaotic ballet to avoid all sources of damage, otherwise you’re sent right back to the start of the level. Dying and restarting only takes a few seconds which is good since you’re likely to die on a constant basis while trying to figure out just the right way to tackle the opposition in front of you. Levels can be completed in multiple ways and styles, like throwing your empty gun at an enemy to stun him and grab the gun he drops so you can turn around and shoot down someone chasing you, then throw the new gun and beat the original enemy to death. Completing a level will have the game replay your endeavours in real time, making your assault look like one seamless act of quick thinking and fancy moves.\n\nOften times there is a -lot- going on in SuperHot to track and manage in terms of threat to your livelihood, so thankfully the visuals have been designed to give players the best chance at survival. The world is shades of white and grey, enemies and their bullets trails are unmistakable red while weapons and bullets are an easily noticeable black. Even with the visuals being so clear on what’s a viable item for self-defense and what’s going to end you, it’s easy to move around or try to take a shot and get blindsided by a baseball bat upside the head or take a bullet in the back. Enemies have set spawns in the levels, so part of the challenge comes from knowing where to look and when - Spawn camping has never felt more justified. Of course there’s an incredible satisfaction in turning around quickly enough to see a bullet getting ready to pierce your ear only to calmly shuffle out of the way to avoid it, or being suppressed by an enemy with an assault rifle only to bob and weave past his stream of bullets and bop him in the mouth to disarm him.\n\nWhile intercepting incoming bullets with your own or throwing a weapon at a slug to save yourself is a neat trick and all, there is a -very- rare but very bizarre case of your fired bullets and thrown weapons outright despawning when you look away. If you toss an empty pistol at an enemy only to look away to punch another, there’s a faint chance that the pistol will have completely disappeared by the time you look back. Combine this with slightly spotty hit detection when it comes to your character taking a fatal bullet or the range for melee strikes being unreliable with respect to whether you can actually strike even when the visual cue is active and later levels end up becoming far more tense and consequence ridden than I would’ve liked. Despite there being a visual notification on enemies when you’re in melee range, attacking can end up with an embarrassing whiff and your character eating whatever punishment they have in mind, which is quite bad when you’re up against multiple enemies armed only with your fists and them with firearms.\n\nThe main campaign won’t take all that long even with repeated deaths, and the story that goes along with it can largely be discarded, but there are a few clever elements to the plot and how it interacts with the main menu, which emulates a DOS-style home computer that the player character is seated at. Completing the game unlocks speed run and survival modes along with special challenges which throw a wrench into the equation like having only a sword and no other weapons, or having your teleport ability (unlocked in the campaign) available from the start but  have your weapons limited to your fists which now instantly kill enemies. Although the majority of these modes take place in the campaign levels, being able to tackle old challenges with new tricks or handicaps can force new, clever strategies out of the player.\n\nSuperHot doesn’t last all that long which is a shame for a game that uses such a great, slick gimmick. I’d argue that the game is a puzzler that just so happens to have guns in it, and after 3 hours I was disappointed that there wasn’t much else to solve excluding the unlocked bonus modes. Credit where due, the developer even decided to make a series of extra modes to extend game time and enjoyment of SuperHot, which would’ve been a short one-trick-pony experience without. It’s a very cool game with a great series of mechanics that ends all too soon, but beyond that I can certainly recommend SuperHot for anyone who wants a combination of shooter and puzzle games that still brings something of its own to the table.","March 14","true","3.8"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","18","25","2","0"

What I will hold against it, however, is the bad quality of the models.

The story consists of about 30 levels and takes you little more than 2 hours to beat. Then there are challenges, which simply are the story all over again with restrictions regarding your choice of weapons or how fast the ingame time flows and endless mode, which has all of its levels ripped out of the campaign. This is not worth the asking price.\n\nWhat's worst about this is the incredible arrogance that the developers display. The game wants you to literally spam your friends with "SUPERHOT is the most innovative shooter I've played in years".

It's fast and fun, and really more of a puzzle game than a shooter. It leans heavily on one or two key gameplay mechanics, but it utilizes them well and is short enough to not wear out it's welcome. It unlocked a few new modes after you've completed the story, and they make for a nice little bit of replay-ability. They set up a nice gameplay loop that I've found myself falling into more than a few times, telling myself that I'd just start it up, play a little in one of those modes, and then find that 2-3 hours have passed.\nThe story itself may not be to everyones liking, but it's something that appeals to me. It's a bit meta, and plays with your head a bit. I could see how one would call it a bit heavy handed, or pretentious, but I think it's more fun and unique.\nIf I had to describe superhot in just one sentence, it would be: The most innovative shooter I’ve played in years.","May 1","true","8.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

You would be supporting a new wave of disingenuous indie titles that seem cool, but provide very little in the way of value to the player.\n\n------\nedit: This sounds harsh, and I stand by it. I buried the main reason for this statement near the bottom under my criticism #4 so I wouldn't spoil the story right here. TLDR, bottom line, is that it feels like your money for this game is going primarily towards the development and maintenance of killstagram.com. You're paying a premium for the privilege to get your friends to also buy the game at its inflated price, and to me, it feels gross.\n------\n\nThe gameplay mechanic, where time moves in super-slow-motion when you're not moving, is admittedly cool. Other neat things are the ASCII OS with phosphorous tint (which is used sometimes to render 3D scenes which looks pretty cool), and the shattering of red dudes when shot.\n\nIt becomes quickly apparent, however, that the game is very overpriced. The animations are poor (character movements remind me of Goldeneye, and the AI is about as advanced), weapon and object models are bland and blocky, and there are only three colors. Though these are obviously deliberate, designed aesthetic choices, as they often are with games made by small teams, normally those choices are for the benefit of other game elements.\n\nedit: I did not make it clear that I do like the visual style--note that this is not one of my major criticisms of the game--read on.\n\nHowever, it's difficult to ascertain what other game elements actually benefitted from these stylistic choices. My major criticisms:\n\n1.  The game is painfully short, and it needs to be, because it gets boring to play towards the end.\n\nThe gameplay devolves into silly bullet-dodging crawls, which you usually need to start over numerous times. I often found myself dying simply because of the randomness of where the AI's shots went--sometimes there is no where to dodge to, sometimes you get just the window you need.\n\nIt's really a game of trial and error; simply not knowing that an enemy would spawn behind me at a particular point in time was pretty annoying too and hardly preventable, given the lack of auditory cues.\n\nThe game simply doesn't introduce new gameplay elements enough along the way, because there aren't many. You get one special ability towards the end--that's it.\n\n2. Little variety in weapons: pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, katana. There are a few other melee weapons like baseball bats that function identically, I suppose. That's it.\n\nBy the way, the katana is not that fun to use: sliced red dudes always are cut through the waist or the neck. For some reason, no pure locational shatter model here--only when you throw it. Pretty disappointing short-cut.\n\n3. Level design is at its best when it's completely derivative: the elevator, top of a train, cubicle farm, parking garage, subway, etc. You've seen all of this in movies.\n\nThere are only ever a few guys to deal with simultaneously, then the game starts pouring them out of different spawn points at different intervals. It's not so much of a puzzle game where it it is rewarding to figure out how to deal with a ton of enemies. Instead the game asks you instead to dispatch the enemies at the start as efficiently as possible so that you can deal with the new spawns in time.\n\nThe notion that speed is so important in a game designed around stopping time is kind of disappointing. It's not really there for you to stop and think as others have claimed--instead it's there for you to tip-toe around bullets and aim yours precisely. It's only about getting kills in as little real-time as possible--execution, not planning.\n\n4. Its story isn't very unique, until you realize that it appears to be primarily a vehicle to "recruit" you--essentially use you as an ad to sell more copies at its ridiculous price. While clever in how it breaks the fourth wall in this way and others, it added insult to injury for me, and simultaneously erased any probing thoughts or remaining questions I had about the story.\n\nSorry to spoil it, but the story doesn't have anything to say except "sell me." You only need to look at the positive reviews for this game to see what I mean.\n\n5. Tacked-on modes did little to alleviate the rest for me or add significant replay value. The only appealing challenge mode is a "katana-only" mode that appears to be mostly a replay of the story levels. Endless is exactly what you'd expect, and I suppose is welcome for those that didn't burn-out on the mechanic by the end of the story.\n\nedit: In summary, SUPERHOT Team evidently chose not to take advantage of an admittedly innovative idea by way of making a great game. Instead they chose to literally capitalize on the idea by taking short-cuts and using the player to sell more games, instead of letting the game speak for itself--because it can't.","February 29","false","2.6"," 233 of 427 people (55%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","55","233","427","15","53"

It starts out with you testing some levels, then chatitng to your friend. Apparently your friend has linked you the game, but you don't understand what the point is: you just run around completly white areas shooting at red dudes. However, soon you start to notice the game isn't what you think it is and soon you loose control. One of us...\n\nSo basically, the game is really short. I beat the story mode in two hours but I've seen people beat it in a hour and a half. Even if it's short, it's quite enjoyable and you can unlock a lot of different levels in "endless mode". The game itself is about you shooting (or meleeing) red dudes, who are the enemies. However, it isn't a normal FPS game since the time - your enemies, the bullets, everything - moves only when you move. So you need to think about your next move, otherwise you'll have a bad time.\n\nAs far as the graphics goes, it's super minimalistic. No colors expect red and white and low-poly. I happen to enjoy those kinds of graphics as much as HD 4k ones, and it's refreshing for a change. But like the game description said, the game has no health bars: so it's press R to restart.\n\nI do recommend the game though, it's a refreshing game for a change.","April 3","true","8.2"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","0"

It’s unique, it’s innovative, and it’s damn good fun. The developers have a wonderful game idea here and they deserve our support for their work and for their achievement. I’m very happy to have supported SuperHot during its beta phase, and I’ve already put in 11 hours of game time and with the possibility to invest many more hours into this brilliant twist on the first person shooter genre (depending on the devs course of action).\n\nSo, after all that praise, why am I not giving it a thumbs up? Simple: the game has some glaring faults that seriously interfere with enjoyment of the game, the worst of which is the collision detection. Let me explain...\n\nCarefully lining up a shot so the bullet passes in between two shelved pieces of glassware thus hitting the red man behind them, the game instead decides to make the bullet collide with one of the glasses which then acts as a shield for the enemy. Said enemy then goes on to kill me because of the inaccuracy of my “missed shot”.\nConclusion: bad collision detection.\n\nA thrown katana races elegantly towards the centre mass of a red man. Just as it's about to connect I feel pleased and confident with my well-aimed throw. The elated feeling, however, quickly turns to horror as I watch the sword touch the surface of my adversary and pass completely through the chest cavity with no effect whatsoever. I'm then unarmed and left at the mercy of a man wielding a rapidly-firing assault rifle.\nConclusion: appauling collision detection.\n\nAn enemy has fired a bullet at my head and I move out of the path of the bullet far enough for it to sail straight past me. Once I’ve reached a safe distance from the trajectory of the incoming bullet I stop moving to slow down time to its minimum value so I can plan my counter attack strategy. While I’m standing there weighing up all of my options, the bullet gracefully glides through the air over towards the far left hand side of my screen. As the bullet is just about to pass me I’ve made my decision for my counter offensive, and I’m about to put that plan into action when BAM - the stray bullet magically manages to hit my head despite me being nowhere near it. I then lose my 100 kill streak in endless mode and start muttering curse words under my breath.\nConclusion: really poor collision detection.\n\nSadly, these aren’t random occurances, as they’ve happened to me many times during my 11 hours. It’s because of this sort of nonsense that I don’t play Battlefield 3 or 4 anymore. SuperHot's main fault is that it seems to treat your character as a human-sized cardboard box. An issue which needs fixing if people are to continue playing the game - and there are a lot of us with this grievance.\n\nVery quickly, other collision issues include: bullets hitting walls even though the gun and the crosshairs are well away from them, and thrown weapons inexplicably exploding in mid air in front of you despite there being plenty of clearance for a successful weapon throw.\n\nAnother problem with which SuperHot suffers is a very short campaign. The game boasts having over 30 levels. The trouble is that most of these can be completed in about one minute - even on your first attempt. So a 30 level story mode took me just over an hour to complete leaving me sat there thinking, “Was that it?”\nTo make matters worse, these short levels are then punctuated with annoying story sequences that interfere with the flow of the levels and the action. However, it is worth noting that the vast majority of the enjoyable gameplay is to be found in the endless mode and the challenges - and these are genuinely fun. Manipulating the accelerating or deceleration of time by varying the velocity of your motion is a great bullet-time mechanic that allows you to overcome the odds despite your being outmanned and outgunned, and I have genuinely enjoyed the bug-free moments.\n\nPros:\n- A really fun first person shooter with a unique mechanic that brings good puzzle work and strategy to the genre\n- A lovely art style that dazzles the senses without ever cluttering up the screen\n- Very nice sound effects that really immerse you in a world where bullet-time rules\n- Watching red glass men crack, crumble, fall apart, and then disintegrate in front of you at what ever speed you choose is wonderfully entertaining\n\nWhat we need from the devs:\n- More levels\n- A level editor so that the community can create and share its own maps and campaigns\n- More variety in enemies and weapons to increase the game's longevity\n- Greatly improved collision detection\n\n\nI will be giving this review a thumbs up when and if the developers fix the game’s problems.\n\nAs always, leave your questions below and I’ll get back to you.\nUntil then, I’ll see you in the matrix...","February 28","false","13.0"," 64 of 113 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","64","113","3","0"

This is the indie darling of the year, and it deserves most of the praise that it is getting.\n\nSTORYThe plot follows the same gist of many meta-games: you are playing as someone playing SUPERHOT, and someone starts writing weird messages to you. If you are familiar with other games such as Pony Island, the game has some decent tricks up its sleave, but, unfortunately, it feels very derivative and not as smart as the aformentioned product.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game has an interesting art-style: white environments with red enemies and black/blu-ish objects. It all looks very polished, but it got kinda old after a while. Thankfully, some Challenges change the color scheme, giving some much needed variety.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe game is a first-person shooter where time moves only when you do, and later on you also unlock the ability to swap your body with an enemy's. This is done extremely well, and you can't but be amazed at how perfectly it was achieved by the developers. Bravo!\nThe only issue I have with the gameplay are the weapons: there are only a pistol, a double-barreled shotgun, a rifle and multiple melee weapons. But still, watching a real-time replay of what you just accomplished is very satisfying.\n\nCHALLENGEDying with one hit makes the game very hard and quite frustrating in certain levels, but having more than one life would've trivialized the entire game. The AI is very smart and usually predicts where you are going to go, so that it can hit you always. After you got the hang on the controls, you can easily outsmart it, especially when knowing where enemies will spawn. The Challenges are also very fun to play, with different modifiers like Katana Only, Fists Only, Throws Kill and many more.\n\nSOUNDThe soundtrack is your typical techno-pop music, and the sound effects are top notch, with sound warping when you move. The words said at the end of each level (SUPER HOT) are quite amusing at first, but they do get annoying after a while\n\nREPLAYABILITYThe main game is very short: it took me under two hours to complete it. However, there are plenty more things to do that will keep you coming back more and more: Challenge mode, Endless mode, secret computers hidden in every level... A game musn't be criticised only for the lenght of the main story, but on the rest of the content as well. And here, there's plenty of fun to be had.\n\nOverall, SUPERHOT is a very innovative and polished game that will appeal to most gamers. If you are here for the story, however, you will be disappointed by its short lenght and its expensive price. A must-buy when at 15$.\n\nStory: 7\nGraphics: 8\nGameplay: 9\nChallenge: 9\nSound: 7.5\nReplayability: 8.5\n\nENJOYMENT: 8.5\nFRUSTRATION: 7\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","May 29","true","7.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Next, look at the price tag.\n\nI'm not saying its a terrible game, but it's sad to see games which think, "I have a cool gimmick, so I'll ignore content, plot, and everything else a normal game has." It's lacking in everything. Weapon selection is low, and monster variety is tied to weapons. Plot is shaky: another game riding the rails of vague hints with no actual substance. "Who? Where? Why?"... never asked, never answered.\n\nOne quirk, bullet speed is slow. Ever play Max Payne? You'd hav'ta lead the bullets a bit. This game takes that to the next level .

I will be beating the story, because I anticipate really enjoying the 'endless' mode.\n\nYou already heard the 'It's too short for how much it costs!' argument (if you read any other negative reviews, at least), but you can play the beta for free still, so let that sell you on the game, because there's some replayability here.\n\nThe narrative, however, forces itself to ruin the experience. It's the 'the game is really playing you!' type of thing that reeks of "look at me I'm edgy" when they already have this AMAZING gameplay concept. Seriously, it's my favorite shooter gameplay to date. And playing it all back again after you beat the level, to make it look like everything you did was in realtime? Literally genius. I also appreciate that it has a platform to share those replays, even if it's a touch buggy right now.\n\nHonestly, there's 1 moment that instantly broke the experience for me\nthe game makes you close the game, after telling you to stop playing the game\n\nIf you are OK with dealing with an hour long story that tries too hard, then bippity boppity boo you found yourself a gosh good game. If you're here for a rich narrative, then leave it alone.\n\nEDIT: I have since beat the game.

Slow time, differential mental spaciation (taking control of others put in a more simple way) and bhop utilization (bunny-hopping).\n\nIf you are like me and like to fully complete games via achievements, then this game is for you. Albeit, it comes at a challenge, but overall I would say the game is both fun and challenging, providing for a great experience.\n\nTLDR: 1. Game is fun\n2. Initial campaign is short, but with added challenges and endless mode, it makes up for quite a number of hours of gameplay.\n3.

Innovative game play, that doesn't get dull. Gives a good challenge, and tense moments. My one negative of this game is it's very short gameplay. I completed the whole story mode in about two hours, which in my mind, doesn't justify the $25 price tag. The endless mode and challenge mode do add some extra life into the game, but again, I wouldn't say enough to justify the price. If they were to add free expansion in the future, then maybe that would change my mind. Overall good game\n\nPros:\n- Fun Gameplay\n- Challengeing at times, but not frustrating\nCons:\n- Short gameplay for the price\n- OK storyline.\n\nI do recommend the game, but would probably wait until a sale, feels more worth like a $10 game at the moment.","February 25","true","7.2"," 34 of 59 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","34","59","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BulletsEverywhere/recommended/322500/","BulletsEverywhere","Bullets","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BulletsEverywhere/","118 products in account","First of all, the game is very short, so if you're looking for something with a story-mode that you can play for 5+ hours, this most likely won't be it. I finished it in one session, probably around 2-3 hours, and I wasn't in a rush doing so.\n\nBut beyond that, it's such a enjoyable game and the most fun I've had with a FPS in a long while. The concept of time only moving when you do (including moving to look around, clicking prematurely and missing a shot/punch, and etc.) is very simple but done well. For those that care about the story, you'll find a strange but creative plot to follow, and for people that just want to shoot a bunch of red dudes, nothing is stopping you from just doing that.\n\nThe level design is unique for each stage, and for the majority of it, it seems fair and fun to move your way through it like a puzzle. A few levels did have issues with starting you too close to enemies and the randomness of their shots sometimes making it tougher than it should, but overall once you learn how to play with the mechanics it isn't too difficult for anyone that normally plays FPS games.\n\nImportantly, just shooting things feels good, seeing them explode into a bunch of shards everywhere. Swords slice through enemies in a very gratifying way, shotguns feel good just to aim into a room and watch a ton of pellets fly everywhere in slow motion, and even throwing a pool ball across the room and smacking a guy in the head with it is an awesome feeling.\n\nOverall get this game if you don't mind spending the cash for a short game, though the experience condensed in two hours is better than what you'd get for a lot of games in 10+ hours. There's replay value for speedrunning, finding secrets, and other modes unlocked upon beating the game, or just self-imposed challanges like melee only. I'd wait for it to go on sale personally or find somewhere cheaper (30$ is a bit steep in my opinion), but definitely pick it up at some point.\n\nEDIT: Playing about 25 hours more, the game has a lot to play than I gave it credit for. Not all the challenges are different and unique, but most are fun and make you play the game in ways you hadn't before. Endless mode is also a cool mode, and there's a good variety of maps and gamemodes with that as well, but there's no motivation not to camp in a room with one entrance and play that way to get a good score, though that doesn't take away the fun of it. Speedrunning the game is really fun as well (not just the mode, but doing actual full-game runs) and the community surrounding it have been nothing but helpful when I've talked to them.","May 3","true","49.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

If you are buying into the hype, do your research.\n\nI want to want this game. I LOVED the browser version so damn much when this idea was just a demo. I made melee only challenges for my friends and I, and I think even one of the devs gave me a suggestion. I was as hyped as anyone else for this game, but unfortunately I'm not sure about putting the money down right now. At a $25 asking price, it's only a couple of hours of linear campaign, involving, for the most part, shooting down hallways or hardly complicated areas. Not that it's meant to be in-depth, but it really could have gone far. Would I have an interest in finishing, then playing through again? Perhaps, but the second playthrough would likely involve a handicap to keep it interesting.\n\nI'm also surprised it's not more fluid than the browser game; in fact, I don't know if there's much of a difference. All weapons have one lightning quick animation, then you wait to use it again. Once you finish the level and view the realtime, it looks more like you're using an aimbot and wall hacks more than being Neo from the Matrix. The only "That's cool!" bits from the replays were when I would purposefully do a turn or unnecessary jump to see it played back, but even then it was underwhelming.\n\nAs excited as I was for this game, I ended up refunding it after 71 minutes of play. I'll watch the rest of the story, and hope that this game either gets some new content, or a map editor. It's quite a shame to see a game that had such massively positive feedback come back in as small of a package as this is. I could see myself buying it again if things improve.","February 26","false","1.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The developers postponed the release so often, I started to have doubts about seeing a result. This in combination with the developers constantly announcing cool, new features built up an enormous hype, the actual game cannot live up to.\n\nIn the end, you have an overpriced 2 hour campaign (I refuse to use the word story, since the game itself says, that there is neither story nor purpose about the things you do.) leaving you behind with additional modes. One could expect to see some nice features here, but nope - Endless Mode and Challenge Mode, both not incorporating anything remarkable. I think the devs simply focused on the wrong things; a VR implementation is nice, but having a truly good game is more important than that.\n\nThe campaign does have its moments: SPOILER  The uncertainty, created by its looks, develop a great atmosphere and this is something completely new.

Developed by the SuperHot Team, this is a first person game with a peculiar twist: time only moves when you do. This allows for some intense sequences where you kill multiple enemies while bullets and limbs whiz past you, and it feels very satisfying to clear an entire level after rampaging through the room and killing half a dozen enemies. I now know what Ryan Reynolds felt like in that masterpiece of a superhero movie, Green Lantern.\n\nThe first thing you notice after you boot up the game is the graphics and presentation: the menu is presented as a computer terminal, and the narrative is often delivered in the form of one of those old IRC chat rooms. The enemies - red, polygonal humanoids - explode into small crystals when killed, and the lack of a HUD adds to the game's immersion by making it look like you're in an action movie's trailer. Sound design remains minimalist, and you will only hear a few different effects throughout the game, such as the hollow 'click' as the gun you are holding is empty and the obnoxiously loud 'SUPERHOT SUPERHOT SUPERHOT' at the end of each level.\n\nThe game's crown jewel is, evidently, the gameplay. The levels themselves are not overtly challenging, the enemies normally coming from all around you, converging on you like the hired thugs on a D list action movie, and while they all die with one bullet so do you. This means you need to be constantly on the move in order to avoid a hail of bullets and pre-empt the enemy movements in order to shoot them successfully. The final few levels do allow you to ''superswitch'' and control an enemy's body, but this does little to change the game's flow.\n\nThe story itself is quite straightforward, just like a binding road. It seems quite clear at the start but turns into quite a mess - that said, the story is never at the forefront of the game, and instead takes a back seat to the gameplay. It is important to keep in mind that each level does contain ''secrets'' or items hidden in obscure areas of the levels that offer an insight into the story for those brave adventurers who stray off the beaten path. However, these secret items are not necessary to complete the story mode and consequently, the story mode is able to be completed in just under 2 hours.\n\nOnce you complete the game's story mode, the challenge and endless mode are unlocked, from which most of the additional replay value comes from. The challenges offer a variety of different elements such as only using katanas, and there are also speed runs in which you must race the clock to complete a level, although this added replay value is only present for as long as the tight gameplay entices you.\n\nOverall, the game is definitely innovative and utilizes an interesting and refreshing mechanic. It is a blast to romp through the game's 2 hour story mode but this may be the game's weakest point - given the price, some might feel the price tag to be a bit on the salty side of things.

Its story is very short, but what super hot offers is addictive, and challenging. The story is easy enough, but racking up giant scores in the endless mode is where I found the most fun. And watching the real time replay is remeniscient of a fast paced matrix loby scene.\nThe story, though short, encapsulates an amazing tone and emotion for the game. I won't spoil specifics, but it held my attention until it was over, and then opened up a range of challenges that I was itching to tackle.\nFor me, the $25 price tag wasn't too much, because it combined my favorite aspects of my favorite action games, and left me thinking, while repeating the game's title over and over again in my head. If you're on the fence, or only looking to complete the story, You may want to wait for a sale.","March 1","true","83.0"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

Pickup guns, shoot red guys, repeat. I love the gameplay and puzzles. However I cannot reccomned this game at it's current price. The amount of content within the game is sparse. The story is only a thought experiment and is short. Really short. I finished the game within the 2 hours that steam allows for refunds and I got my money back. The game is great and the concept is fresh and well executed. But the lack of content or the ability to create custom levels makes it lacking. It is not worth even the $22.49 I paid for it on sale.

But the entire game is designed as a twitch shooter, and without sensory cues of where enemies are like footsteps and voices due to the entire game being drowned out by a "wind tunnel" effect apparently caused by the slow motion, and the entire color pallet being black, white, and red you're constantly being snuck up on by people and getting killed with a single shot that grazes your shoulder. And of course, despite every other "twitch shooter" in existence, the game requires you to (for some reason) lead every single one of your shots and determine where your enemy is moving. This would be all well and good if you had a sniper rifle a few hundred yards away, but this is handguns and assault rifles with enemies no more than thirty to fifty feet away.\n\nSo it's a twitch shooter that requires you to precisely aim shots and know where your enemies are while you're lacking one of your basic human senses. And to top it all off, the plot is only about an hour and a half long, so congratulations, if you purchased SuperHot you spent $20 for a two-hour long frustrationfest with clunky gameplay and a useless "gimmick" that tries to sell itself as innovative. And the plot, which I will not spoil (just watch a Lets Play or walkthrough) is INCREDIBLY pretentious, to Matrix levels, throwing out random bits of plot that just shove the message of the game right in your face, a message we've seen a million times since computers became a mainstream appliance, and the game acts like it's so smart. And the ending literally tells you to tell your friends the game is "the most innovative shooter you've ever played." No, I'm serious, it tells you, to your face after the ending, to try to sell the game to your friends by saying it's innovative and awesome. Don't buy this game, put the $20 towards something with ACTUAL innovation and gameplay that wasn't designed by someone trying to be artsy and "deep."","March 5","false","2.0"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","20","35","0","0"

I understand that games that know they are games is cool, but that dose not really add any depth to the game.\n\nLet me star by saying that yes, the time stopping unless you make a move is a great mechanic. It makes fights more puzzles then the twitch fights we get.\n\nLet me finish by saying that the narrative is full of itself. First, it pretends to have an IM chat with you, but you can't actually type. It fills itself out. Thats not fun, thats just a cutscene I have to tap buttens to see. Plus when it pulls the "what you type changes" act, it loses weight. Then it puts you in a room to be a "tutorial". And pulses actions in your eyes untill you do it. And then it calls you a dog.\n\nThis is my problem, the story is that you should not play the game, because it said so. Not because killing is wrong, not because you in game did not pay for it, but because its meta, it knows it's a game. Look, I get this game has been in development for a while. But Undertale did what this game wants better, Pony Island did what this game wants to do better. The meta concept needs depth and story to be strong. This game dose not have it, and outright insults you for playing.\n\nSo this is half a game. A great mechanic, that as an endless run high score game would be great. As a puzzle game would be great. But then it tries to play mind games, and without any mystery, or characters of any kind, it falls far short.\n+ Fun mechanic\n+ A puzzle game, not a shooter\n\n- A meta game with no depth\n-Menu and loading screans flicker, and that hurts\n\n5/10\n","March 7","false","1.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The feeling of snatching a gun out of someone's grip, spinning around and blasting the guy behind you, tossing the weapon at another guy, possessing him, grabbing the weapon and shooting your old body is amazingly cool!\n\nHowever...\n\nIt turns out that I was experiencing a bug which drastically slowed down the game, making your movements and the physics happen much more slowly. It was all still proportional, because everything moved slower. The latest update fixed this, making the game much faster.\n\nIt also made the game suck.\n\nBeforehand, it had the feel of a puzzle game. Minor adjustments were the difference between life and death. You still felt like a major badass, but actually playing the game felt like a cerebral challenge, as you could see certain things (i.e enemy shots) lining up before they happened. This lead to some insanely cool moments, like when I just managed to dodge two assault rifle bursts whilst running down a hallway, and timed my katana throw perfectly so that it killed one of the guys just as his own bullet killed his friend. Now, that feeling is gone as each level basically becomes a massive spaz out where all the time to think is gone, and death comes from behind constantly. It's just not fun.\n\nI feel stupid now, because if I'd known this is how the game actually ran, I would have refunded it straight away, or not bothered to buy it. Now it's too late, and I'm stuck with a game I hate and £17 or so quid down.\n\nTL;DR : Game was fun when bugged, now it's fixed and it plays like ♥♥♥♥.","March 3","false","9.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It gives players of any skill level a unique action-puzzle experience that ends up being a blend of The Matrix meets MKultra if M.K. stood for Manchurian Killer.\n\nIt's better as an arcade game, and you'll unlock that mode following the completion of the short story campaign. I thought it was a tensionless, droll experience up until about the point where the story began to end, when the levels become much more difficult (when it became fun).\n\nThere's a lot to get into in too many words, so here was my experience.\n\nSpoilers will not be tagged, but I'll try to avoid blatantly spelling it out.\n\nSuper Hot is all about glamour and if you're a playful gamer, you'll have plenty to do. The campaign is presented very well, but I always felt three steps ahead of the cyberpunk story. It ended at about the point where I thought it should've continued on, but damn it was it ever presented in a visually exciting way. I went on to discover all the game's secrets and that's where the story started to really lose me.\n\n"You aren't actually going to reveal anything, I get it, Super Hot." And then Super Hot's mysterious Red Voice continued on and on with its attitude. I continued to find the secrets because it did answer some of its questions, only for it to conclude with a reward for my dedication, and while I appreciate that it fits back in with the hypnosis/brainwashing angle, I felt as insulted by the game as if it asked me if I wanted to buy more energy, like a freemium game would.\nThe "secrets" were ultimately unecessary, since like I said, the majority of the ""secret"" """"answers"""" were questions that I'm confident most players solved themselves in the campaign.\n\nWhat a strange path the story took though. I was really into it up until the point where it was clear that the secrets were bunk, and then it got all capitalist on me and threw the punk part of the cyberpunk out the window with the coupon.\n\nStill, tho, the game's themes and presentation are intertwined, and I actually do like Killstagram because it ties back into the boldness of their compulsion to make you part of their viral marketing, and even the warez angle feeds into the viral edginess. That stuff is fantastic. Moreover, Killstagram feeds into the playfulness and how much fun you can have by learning that juggling guns and banking thrown objects off walls is the most hilarious and cool looking fun you can have. Killstagram, if you're into it, changes the way you approach the game, turning it into something more creative than clearing the mission.\n\nThe story is an intro to cyberpunk and posthuman themes though, and its style and tone are its own. I just wish they excluded the "secrets" which ruined it pretty handily.\n\nSo, yes. It's true. The game really starts after the campaign ends. This game is so much more engaging as an arcade game with rules and restrictions. The puzzle aspect really shines when the game becomes challenging, forcing you to think creatively, and even reactively...\n\nSo yeah, I keep bouncing back and forth on whether or not this game is Super Hot or Over Rated because I keep thinking back to the F.E.A.R. series as one of the big games to use slo-mo in a glamorous way  but I think you'll probably enjoy the game of Super Hot, and if you didn't find it very challenging, keep playing and the intensity will increase through later modes.","March 23","true","6.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I completed it in about 2 hours, with messing around in the campaign (Trying dumb stuff, no slow mo, etc).

If the story was longer, I'd have no issues paying 23 euros for the game, but as it stands I am a bit disappointed.\n\nOverall I feel like the game is great, especially if you don't care about the story and just want to kill the red guys, the endless mode is great and offers a lot of neat challenges.","February 26","true","2.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spacedad/recommended/322500/","Spacedad","Spacedad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spacedad/","475 products in account","SUPERHOT is a game that starts out with a videodrome-like plot built around simple gameplay, a lot like the Jacob's Ladder experience that was Pony Island.\n\nBut whereas Pony Island was more about the strange twists things took, Superhot's shorter simpler plot arc doesn't do much more than act as bumpers for the gameplay, and is ultimately an unsatisfying narrative.\n\nBut what great gameplay!  The real 'meat' of the game actually starts AFTER you finish the main story and start working through the challenges and endless mode.  In fact, the main reason for anyone to buy this game in my view is that it will help train your quick-thinking skills - this game is a wonderful 'workout' for your nervous system when you get into it!\n\nWhen you do get far into the challenges, you will find yourself going into 'the zone' an awful lot, and pulling off amazing combos at near-realtime.  It's extraordinarily satisfying and great fun when you do.  This game and its challenge modes warrant multiple playthroughs in my view, to keep training your skill and improving what combos you can pull off.\n\nPROS\n-Fantastic core gameplay built around a simple well-done premise\n-Trains your quick-thinking strategic skills and reflexes\n-You can see yourself physically getting better as you tend to play more in 'real time' as you get better\n-Some interesting little side-gimmicks\n-A uniquely surreal and bleak sense of humor\n-Pretty to look at for such simple graphics, and very nice sound design\n-Challenges and endless mode are the real 'meat' of the game, and fantastic satisfying fun\n\nCONS\n-Gameplay could have been developed and expanded upon much more than it was (more enemy types, more weapon variety, more gameplay twists than just bodyswapping, more level scenarios pushing what you can do)\n-Some minor annoyance with some melee attacks not quite connecting in spite of swinging close\n-Weak and altogether too short story\n\nOverall: 8/10 - With the asterisk that I feel this is a 'must-buy' for anyone who fancies themselves and esports player. This is a game you can play on your downtime to train your reflexes or warm up your quick-thinking skills.  Additionally I would bump this to 9/10 if post-launch sees free updates with additional content.","February 25","true","8.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The game mechanic is amazing and what makes this game worth your time. The campaign lasts about 2 hours but the majority of it is action/gameplay. After that there's challenges and endless mode to play around with. The challenges tend to be restrictions such as using only a certain type of combat (fists, swords, thrown) and after a while might get repetitive as every map in the challenge mode is taken straight form the campaign. Endless is about what you'd expect, kill as many as you can until you die. You can also choose to play with a time limit which you unlock for each level it if you prefer an actual end that isn't death. It's too high priced at $25 at the moment in my opinion but it's certainly worth picking up when it drops price.","February 25","true","13.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","9","16","3","0"

Thinking this game looks great I will get my two hours in and call it good. That didn’t happen. Once I was in the game had me reeled in and I could not put it down. Played through the entire story mode in one sitting and started to pick at endless mode and challenges after that.\n\nSUPERHOT just throws your right into the action with its intuitive controls and addicting game play. You start out just killing red dudes because they want to kill you and then your roped into this swirling story that leaves you wonder “What the hell is going on?” and you keep wanting more, you become a slave to the system until it “Frees” you.\n\nThis game has a ton of replay ability built in with 100ish challenge to complete and many levels of endless madness after the campaign. The mechanic that this game is made on is truly one of a kind! Time only moves when you move so you find yourself jumping into a level and getting into it then dying, trying a couple more times. After a bit you get the pattern down and start working on a path to victory but the great thing is every playthrough is different based on how you move through the map.\n\nThe graphic style is great, and it's one that could run on practically any system. The game play is seamless and enjoyable. I cannot leave out the awesome soundtrack as well.\n\nIn closing I would give this game 10/10 and would recommend it to anyone that wants a challenging game that they can pick up and play without too much set up or grinding. All you have to do is enter the system and start killing red dudes.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the review as much as I enjoyed playing the game!

I exhausted the gameplay to the point that my initial addiction it waned and the only thing that I was hyped about was the story. The prototype (which took me 2 hours to beat, as I died repeatedly) ended with a cliffhanger.\n\nPros\n\nUnique Bullet Time mechanic\n(As of this writing) plenty of unsolved secrets\nPlenty of modes and challenges after completion of the initial story\nA unique story\nCons\n\nProvided you don't die a lot, the campaign can be completed around 90 minutes.\nThe gameplay is the only thing that holds it, don't expect anything more.\nThe price tag\nI'll just say this off the bat, I liked the game. I really do. The story drew me in and in my own opinion, it had a good ending. The gameplay in the game is one of a kind, there is no game like it.\n\nBUT, it's asking price of around PHP500+ and it's apparent $20+ price tag in the West is too much. The campaign is far too short for the asking price. Though there are challenges, easter eggs and an endless mode; which add a certain sense of replayability, once the glamour of the gameplay wears off, there's not much left in the game.\n\nSo as much as it pains me, I refunded the game. I spent 90 minutes on the campaign and an additional 30 minutes on the challenges, but I got bored quickly.\n\n1) Buy it now\n2) Wait for a sale\n3) Wait for a BIG DISCOUNT when it's on sale\n4) Don't touch it\n\nThe game deserves your money, but not the price it's asking.","February 28","false","2.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

It took me slighty over 2 hours to play it, if your good, it'll probably only take you like 90 minutes.

I'm sure I'll jump into the challenges and endless mode now and again as well.\n\nThe game is very pure, it has basically one "mode" and it has its one gimmick, but it does it extremely well.

Sounds easier than it actually is.\n\nThere isn't much more to say because thats basically the content that is there. If I were you, I'd look up a 5 minute or so gameplay video and see if it draws you in, because once you've seen the one type of mode, you'll be able to tell if its up your alley.

And it would be correct. This game is legitimately one of the most innovative shooters that has been seen in years. With a minimalist design and a sneakily engaging story, SUPERHOT is the type of game that needs to come around more often. It challenges the "norms" and conventions that we've come to expect in modern video gaming. It gives the shooter genre a good solid twist and flip upside down and comes up with something special.\n\nThis game should be played by almost anyone who enjoys a shooter. The "time moves only when you move" mechanic is well implemented and creates a whole new way of approaching a shooter.\n\nPros:\n+ Strong design.\n+ Challenging.\n+ Thought-provoking.\n+ New modes unlock after completing the campaign.\n+ Replay sharing/Killstagram.com\n\nCons:\n- MSRP (currently $24.99 at the time of this review, not counting release discount).\n- Campaign length is saddeningly short. My playtime is at 3.3 hours for just the campaign - start to finish.\n\nOverall I am very impressed with SUPERHOT. It lives up to the hype of innovation and is very engaging from the start. However, I do have a few gripes with it. Obviously, it's a fairly expensive game right out of the gate. While I respect the fact the developers put a lot of time (I've been following SUPERHOT for at least 1.5 years) into it and largely perfected the experience, it still feels high-priced for what it does provide.\n\nThere is a campaign which must be played before any of the other modes unlock, which include an Endless Mode (exactly what it means), "Challenges", and Speedruns. I am unaware at the moment if there are plans to expand the campaign levels or if there will be a level editor. I think this is exactly the type of game that would benefit greatly from that sort of addition. At the very least the Campaign is very engaging both in respect to the story (yep, there is one) and execution. Some of these levels make you feel like the ultimate badass as you cut through swathes of "red dudes". It's a lot of fun, but the length is very disappointing.\n\nI definitely recommend this game with a few caveats. If you are a fan of shooters and want something new and different to play, this is right up your alley. If you're more of a casual gamer, I totally suggest you play it too, but you may want to wait a little while and get it down the line when its a little cheaper and perhaps will have more content or user-made content available. That said, this game is a wonderful step in a new direction and I applaud the developers for the work they've done here and no matter what you pay, you are likely to find enjoyment out of it.","February 27","true","8.0"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","12","22","2","0"

It is a cool idea for a game. However, I do not think the current asking price is reasonable. It feels like the type of game you could pick up on mobile for £5, which is NOT what I want from a pc standalone title.\nAfter you finish the story you can do endless mode, or challenge mode, but after you get over the gimmicky slow-mo it becomes quite dull and repetitive. Maybe worth picking up if it's on sale for £5-£10.\n\nOverall I would rate this game 5/10 if the story was longer and with more features such as co-op or a level builder etc.  I think it could really have potential to be a high 7-8/10 but in it's current state it unfortunately falls short.","February 28","false","3.6"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","0"

This game is unforgiving with every wrong move but when you succeed and finally complete a level its extremely satisfying. It also includes a replay feature where you can save and upload all of your replays after completing a mission to their website killstagram.com which seems to currently be in the beta stages.\n\n\nThe story is also fairly unique and the way they execute it is quite genius for the type of game it is (for example, the game will tell you to leave, and glitch out forcing you to exit the game). The game plays tricks on your mind as you navigate through the world not knowing whats next. It feels like you're playing virual reality while stuck in the matrix. Time moves when you do allowing you to plot your next move but if you move in the wrong direction or waste too much time, youre dead and have to start the level over again.\n\n\nSUPERHOT is really different from any other game I have ever played and has plenty of replay value with its Endless Modes and Challenges. I highly recommend this game, although the price tag is fairly steep I would suggest looking for it cheaper elseware.","February 26","true","14.4"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","0"

Canadian.\n\nThe lack of a soundtrack is a stylistic choice, but not one I agree with. I feel like having music that was slowed down with the time stops would have added to the experience.\n\n\nIt's not unenjoyable, but it feels like you're paying a whole lot of money for an early access game that isn't going to get finished.

The levels are brilliant, and there is a nice balance between an action packed shooter and a game in which you stop and think.

I have only had time to try out the first few levels which are pretty much tutorials, but holy crap is it awesome. There are lots of FPS puzzle games, but not like this. There isn't a puzzle in the level that you solve to move forward, the whole level is a puzzle and you're one of the pieces, so are all of the bullets and mobs. The time mechanic is great, it reminds me of an old game I used to play as a kid called "Robots" on Linux. You had a level which was a grid, nothing moves until you do, and the object of the game was to use the level to destroy the robots, as every time you move, they close in on you. SUPERHOT's a bit different as the mobs are closing in, but they are shooting at you which means that you have to dodge them, their bullets, and compesnate your aim so that your bullets find their mark too (since the mobs will try to dodge them). Obviously there's also the major difference of SUPERHOT being an FPS as well as having an awesome even if simple art style. An excellent job all around on this one!\n\nThe menu system and interaction is great too. When I saw the retro terminal interface I was immediately transported back to my early childhood where the command line was your only interface to the system.\n\nGreat job SUPERHOT Team!","February 27","true","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is there to introduce you to the basics, and is a mix between 1984 and The Matrix.\n\nMID: The fact that you can complete the actual story under 2 hours without tryharding isn't really what bothers me. Endless mode and challenges are here to keep you entertained, plus the game got tons of secret and hidden content.\nThe price tag ? It was the same when I bought it in beta, over a year ago. Would I buy it now, at this price, for this content, if I haden't before ? Probably not. On sale would be better.\n\nCONS: Poorly optimized. The beta already suffered from this, but I can't believe the game still manages to stutter so much. Frame drops, freezes, specially shapes-filled situations. Moreover, all of this still happens on lowest settings, and on a high-end gaming PC.\n\nOverall, the game is great, the concept is great, but as of right now it needs some love and some testing in order to be really great, so i wouldn't recommend buying it at full price.\n\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play","February 26","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm not even going to complain about the pricing, frankly the game is not fleshed out enough to justify a purchase at all. Even on a sale. You'll play the single player, maybe dabble in some of the challenge or endless modes and then you'll realize you won't really want to play it anymore.\n\nIf you're really interested, buy it, play it for under 2 hours and return. It's definitely worth trying but don't let the cheap meta story hook you into playing past the return time limit. There's a vague, tacked on narrative here that really feels like it's in place to take advantage of your curiousity so that you'll think there's something worth playing towards but there really isn't. Nothing satisfying at least and by that point it'll probably be past the point of steam returns, so don't fall for that trap.\n\nThere's likely some community based ARG that helps unveil "THE TRUE STORY" but I don't know. I guess if you're into that then this is for you. To me it just seems like they're deceiving customers into being okay with any kind of quality gameplay running dry after only a couple hours.\n\nTl;dr\nIt's original, so it'll feel fun at first, but you'll very quickly realize it's shallow and boring.","March 9","false","5.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

As a result it's always very clear what you're supposed to be doing. While it is an FPS game, the core mechanic turns it in to something much more strategy-based, especially when attempting the challenge modes.\n\nThe main criticism people have with the game is that it's too short, and that's true if you ignore all the extra content that comes after completing the story mode. If you're somebody that enjoys challenging yourself, then you'll have many hours of fun with the challenge modes, in that respect the story mode is more like a long tutorial.\n\nMy only personal gripe is that the boss character featured in the prototype didn't make an appearance, but understandably they decided to take the game in a different direction.\n\nIn short, if you like the look of this and you understand that the story mode is only a small portion of the game, then I absolutely recommend it.","February 28","true","12.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

ASKING PRICE RIDICULOUSLY TOO HIGH. "It’s The Most Innovative Shooter I’ve Played In The Years" The game told me to say this, but I don't disagree. SUPERHOT is a game that has caught my eye for a few years now and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. I literally started the game up the second it unlocked and I had a blast, but the shortage of actual content was disturbing for what they wanted from the consumer.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- SUPERHOT\n-Intresting gameplay, gets better longer you play with it. Not like any other FPS I have played. Very addictive.\n-semi-intresting story.\n-simple to play, difficult to master.\n-very polished, little to no bugs encountered.\n-Endless mode: I found myself getting lost in this mode, this is how you should experiment with the gameplay and get the most out of it.\n-AI's not too shabby\n\nWhat I did not like:\n-short story. (2 hours or less)\n-not enough content to warrant asking price.\n-Niche weapon selection.\n-Can't really change key bindings.\n-Challenge mode: mostly rehashing of story levels.\n-Hit boxes are a bit iffy at times.\n-Couldn't change FOV settings. Very important to have for an FPS.\n\nSome of my additional opinions:\n-Minimalist graphics may not be appealing to everyone.\n-I love fourth wall breaks and this game has plenty.\n-The menus have a lot of character.\n-I felt like some bullets can be difficult to distinct whether they will hit you or not.\n\nConclusion:\nThe story ends way too quickly, but offered a very enjoyable ride with stellar gameplay and fourth wall breaks. The gameplay alone is worth buying the game, but no where near the asking price of $24.99 or your regional equivalent. WAIT UNTIL A SALE TO BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL THANK ME LATER.\n\nAnd thank you for your time!","February 25","true","7.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

There is nothing more satifiying than watching all the cool ♥♥♥♥ you did during a level in real time and getting to easily save and upload it to view over and over again. The improvements to the game with the Throwable weaponry and varied weapons add more depth to the game and once the Switch Mechanic comes into play you can do some very clever stuff.\n\nThe challenges range from enjoyable nostalgia romps to frantic perfection to pure agonising frustration and give a nice depth of post game. The endless modes can be a barrel of fun to just casually slaughter everything and overall all the little details really make the game stand out. On top of that the fact that you can give friends discount codes for the game when you beat it is a very nice touch\n\nPersonally I think that maybe £17.99 is a bit of a steep asking price and the main story being a bit short is a shame but if you have enough money to consider it I'd honestly say it's worth the experience.

I can't help but think this game had much more potential in terms of content and expanding upon the game mechanic, which is not to say it's bad. It's a very fresh experience, which in itself might be worth full price to some. I'd recommend it, although most people probably should get this at a discount instead. The developer should release a level editor I think so people get to challenge others.\n\nWhat it could have (in a sequel / future version / expansion / ?) IMHO:\n-wall running\n-flicks / saltos\n-diving\n-hand to hand combat where the enemy gets to parry\n-basically the type of moves that would fit bullet time games\n-3rd person mode?\n\nNo clue how feasible any of this is, but Superhot makes me want more in the same genre, but expanded upon the concept.

ASKING PRICE RIDICULOUSLY TOO HIGH. "It’s The Most Innovative Shooter I’ve Played In The Years" The game told me to say this, but I don't disagree. SUPERHOT is a game that has caught my eye for a few years now and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. I literally started the game up the second it unlocked and I had a blast, but the shortage of actual content was disturbing for what they wanted from the consumer.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- SUPERHOT\n-Intresting gameplay, gets better longer you play with it. Not like any other FPS I have played. Very addictive.\n-semi-intresting story.\n-simple to play, difficult to master.\n-very polished, little to no bugs encountered.\n-Endless mode: I found myself getting lost in this mode, this is how you should experiment with the gameplay and get the most out of it.\n-AI's not too shabby\n\nWhat I did not like:\n-short story. (2 hours or less)\n-not enough content to warrant asking price.\n-Niche weapon selection.\n-Can't really change key bindings.\n-Challenge mode: mostly rehashing of story levels.\n-Hit boxes are a bit iffy at times.\n-Couldn't change FOV settings. Very important to have for an FPS.\n\nSome of my additional opinions:\n-Minimalist graphics may not be appealing to everyone.\n-I love fourth wall breaks and this game has plenty.\n-The menus have a lot of character.\n-I felt like some bullets can be difficult to distinct whether they will hit you or not.\n\nConclusion:\nThe story ends way too quickly, but offered a very enjoyable ride with stellar gameplay and fourth wall breaks. The gameplay alone is worth buying the game, but no where near the asking price of $24.99 or your regional equivalent. WAIT UNTIL A SALE TO BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL THANK ME LATER.\n\nAnd thank you for your time!","February 25","true","7.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

SUPER. HOT... SUPER. HOT... SUPER. HOT...\n\n--------------------------\n\nIN ALL SERIOUSNESS:\nThis game is INCREDIBLE. 9/10.\nMy one gripe with this game is its price, though. $25US is a very high price for a game with a 2 hour story. Although the endless mode is incredible too, there just isn't enough content to justify it in my own eyes. Mind you, im a binge gamer so maybe I'm not the best to judge.\nAs far as sound goes, the slow-motion and speed up sound effects works perfectly. The DOS Operating System-esk theme with the UI and loading screen sounds nostalgic to say the least.\nIn terms of graphics I experienced minor frame drops for no apparent reason and the game would only start on my second monitor. However these 2 things are not enough for me to think less of this game. It is incredible.\nGameplay is the key feature of this game. The whole time-moves-when-you-move concept is captivating, creating a mechanic that never ceses to amaze. But I can't express in words just how it works and why it's incredible. Total Biscuit made a WTF IS video about it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJVrquYvGRA and it's available (obviously) on steam for you to buy if you have the spare cash.\nStory: I was shaking. It is actually quite overwhelming how this game can capture you, albeit it is quite short. The ending: Award worthy. Go play it.\nI'm not revealing much as I feel it is something that can't be expressed through text, but through actually playing the game and frankly I dont have the time to write an essay.

What a breath of fresh air.  The base gameplay feels like nothing else I've ever played.  This is action that has all kinds of craziness to it at a pace that is slowed down a little bit more than enough to barely be able to deal with it all.  Time only moves when you do, but you're still under constant pressure and constant fire.  Throwing guns at people to take their other guns from them, dodging bullets, grabbing a telephone and whipping it at the incoming bullets to destroy that oncoming shotgun blast, switching bodies to the guy behind the machine gunner giving you trouble and punching him in the head, etc etc etc..\n\nThe campaign is great, but it's just the warm-up.  Once it is completed there are Endless modes and Challenges to complete and unlock.  The first to unlock is a Katana-Only set of what you already know, but you're unable to use anything but the Katana you started with.  Switches up every strategy I had formed prior.  I found myself learning new tricks the whole way.  My friends and I have been switching off every couple runs in an attempt to unlock everything and even after 13 hours we still haven't unlocked it all yet.\n\nThere's a couple minigames hiding in here, like Tree Dude, which can be fun if you're in the mood for something simple.\n\nI don't think the price is too high, and I don't think the campaign is too short (since it's really just at tutorial, sort of).

SUPERHOT would be a Jackie Chan movie, if Jackie Chan was really into cyberpunk and had seen The Matrix a thousand times. It's a game where you beat up a dude in a bathroom stall, then you pick up the bottle in the corner of the restroom, use it to glass the face of the red dude coming in for a ♥♥♥♥, and after all that, you see the bartender with his shotgun in his hands, and you dare to pick up one of the billard balls on the pool table, and then you dare even harder to chuck it at his ♥♥♥♥ing head. It's ♥♥♥♥ing wonderful improvisation combat in the form of a puzzle FPS.\n\nThe game does a fantastic job telling you all the basics without having to explain it to you through its use of colors and visual language. The scenery is white-grey, things you kill with are colored black, red dudes are bad and must be punished, use black things to kill red dudes. Even if you haven't played many FPS games, you'll know instantly what's going on, allowing you to focus on the puzzle side of the game - the puzzle of how you kill those red dudes. And even then, the game manages to pull out some novel takes on its formula - the Elevator Pitch level is a ♥♥♥♥ing great take on using your fists to get the upper hand on three people with guns pointed at you point-blank.\n\nSome whiners say that the three-hour campaign is too little story for $25. But they're also ignoring the wealth of challenges, the Endless mode, and the various secrets built into the game. And even if we're judging the game entirely by its entire campaign - SUPERHOT has a really well done, solid campaign, one that hits its mark, never misses a beat, and knows exactly where to start and when to quit. I'd rather have a campaign that is three hours long, artfully paced, knowing how best to deliver its thrills, and is concluded properly rather than a campaign that takes fifteen hours, wears out its welcome, and farts out a conclusion that makes me never want to play the game again after I'm done. Have we learned nothing from ♥♥♥♥ing Portal, a game that is almost flawless and just two hours long? Meeting an arbitrary goal of how much time your game consumes does not make a game good.\n\nThe only real complaint I have is that I don't know if the stuff between the campaign levels is going to hold up for me down the line? I imagine myself old and toothless, and I'll scream WHAT IS THIS DOS ♥♥♥♥, I NEED TO KILL THE RED PEOPLE. And then I'll throw my cellphone at the TV and have to be sent to work in the salt mines on the Plutonian Asteroid and Old Folks' Home.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/godot209/recommended/322500/","godot209","Venom Yang","http://steamcommunity.com/id/godot209/","470 products in account","I was looking forward to this game and I'm rather disappointed, honestly. It starts out pretty great, but after the first hour, it starts to lose steam. It doesn't really build on anything introduced in the rather promising demo.\n\nThe story is kind of meh. There's a fun (optional) chat room that you can sit and watch for some minor exposition but the main narrative feels forced and contrived. For example, the same character/entity that forces you out of the game several times ends up being the one to let you back in because apparently the game is some kind of recruiting tool? It's kind of weird to shut people out of the game, and password protect it, and force the players into virtual prison and shoot them repeatedly, if your end goal is to actually recruit them and have them all "join" the program anyway.\n\nI was hoping Endless mode would be a bigger draw, but after about two hours of that, it also wears out its welcome. It's just the same handful of enemies over and over again, and they all either run at you, run at you and shoot, or stand still and shoot.\n\nI'd say the game is definitely worth getting on sale, and I don't think it's a wholly bad game. It just didn't really meet my expectations. However, the devs seem like nice people and are going to update the game with new content for free, so I might revise this review in the future.","March 2","false","5.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/conkerkid11/recommended/322500/","conkerkid11","Conkerkid11","http://steamcommunity.com/id/conkerkid11/","722 products in account","IT'S THE MOST INNOVATIVE SHOOTER I'VE PLAYED IN YEARS\nNow that I've gotten that obligation out of the way, SUPERHOT is a short but sweet game centered around the premise of time manipulation in a first-person shooter. If you haven't played the free demo that's been floating around online for the last couple years, you should probably play it, as that will determine whether or not you'll like this game.\n\nThere's an overall narrative similar to Pony Island, if you've played it. Basically, you're thrown from stage to stage with the objective of killing all the red guys. They'll be equipped with their fists, pistols, shotguns, machine guns, etc... And you'll be using time manipulation to deal with all of them. They take one hit (3 with fists or thrown objects) to kill, and so do you. If you die at any point during one of the many brief stages, you'll be thrown back to the beginning of that stage to learn from your mistakes, and try again, eventually defeating all of your foes, and moving onto the next stage.\n\nThe main story mission takes about 90 minutes to complete, give or take a little based on your ability to grasp the time manipulation concept.\n\nOnce you're finished with the main story mission, you'll be provided with access to all 32 missions you previously completed, endless mode, and some challenges.\n\nEndless mode is a whole bunch of levels from the story mode where the overall goal in each level is to kill as many enemies as you possibly can, allowing you to unlock even more levels in this mode. This is probably the mode that most of your money is going toward, as it seems to provide the most content out of anything in the game. So before somebody tries to persuade you that the game is too expensive for a 2 hour (or 90 minute in my case) campaign, they probably didn't try out endless mode.\n\nChallenges are unlocked by accomplishing certain tasks throughout the story mode's missions, and once a challenge is unlocked, it will unlock a new mode for all of the main story missions, such as a speed run mode, or a speed run mode with a timer that counts down even when you're not moving. Not quite sure what all the other modes are, as I haven't unlocked them yet. There's 13 in total. Besides the two speedrun ones I have, there's also one where you only have a katana.\n\nBeyond the main time manipulation game, you can also navigate the game's unique main menu to find some other various mini-games and fun bonus content.\n\nI've seen the pricing for this game compared to something like Firewatch, but in the end, both games are around the same length, except Firewatch doesn't have any endgame content, and frankly SUPERHOT's story is more interesting.\n\nPros    Unique time manipulation mechanic for an FPS.\nUnique graphics, combined with interesting UI that makes for an interesting narrative similar to Pony Island.\nA lot more bang for your buck that I would have initially expected based on the demo that released however many years ago.\nDodging enemy bullets can get really fun, especially when you realize that they tend to lead their shots, so strafing in one direction is generally not the best decision.\nNeat mechanic introduced late into the game that I'd rather not spoil here. It's used in endless mode though. Really cool feature in the game that I wasn't expecting.\nThe story mission levels are based around action scenes in popular films.\nWhen you finish a level in any mode, you get to watch and edit the full-speed version of the entire level's gameplay footage from your perspective. That means none of the time manipulation stops, so you get to look like you're even better at first-person shooters than you really are. Clips can be edited and uploaded straight to a website called Killstagram too.\nSUPERHOT SUPERHOT SUPERHOT\nCons    For a game that touts an endless mode based around high scores, there's no online leaderboards, at least at launch that is. I have no idea if the devs plan on adding them in post-launch or something, but as it is, you kill as many baddies as possible in a level, and then when you die, it saves that score, and you can view it from the level select screen as your "Personal High Score". Kind of makes trying to achieve high scores not as much of a thrill when you're competing with yourself.\nEndless mode levels are also unlocked based on overall kills in that level, rather than kills in a single run, making going for a high score even more pointless.\nCollision boxes on everything are absolutely terrible. You'll be shooting invisible barriers, and accidentally throwing objects and weapons at them rather than the enemy you're aiming for.\nQuite a few bugs here and there. For awhile, I couldn't even access Endless Mode, so I almost wasn't going to mention it in the review. Guns fall through the floor sometimes, enemy dead bodies get in the way a lot, flow of time can sometimes randomly fluctuate even though you may not have done anything to cause it.\nTry not to press "ESCAPE". For some odd reason, there's no pause menu, so it just straight up brings you out of whatever you're doing, and backs you out to the main menu. Had to repeat quite a few levels because of this, as the story mission levels don't save after every mission. Game almost wants you to beat the whole thing in one sitting or something.\nNo indication of how many bullets are in a weapon as far as I can tell. The reload indicator is cool and unique, but why can't I tell how many bullets I have left in my gun? Seems kind of important to know.\nFirst-person shooters in the past have taught me to aim for the head. There's no reason besides an achievement in SUPERHOT. Hitting enemies anywhere will kill them, and more often than not, their other body parts are far easier to hit.","February 26","true","5.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","6","11","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WoolyBug/recommended/322500/","WoolyBug","WoolyBug","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WoolyBug/","771 products in account","The basic premise is a friend of yours finds a crack to a new video game and sends it to your computer.\nI guess I could define it as a time based, first person shooter...\nBut, that wouldn't be exactly correct.\nI could say it's a puzzle game disguised as a shooter, but that would leave out the time dilation, hacking, amazing ballistics simulation, and of course... things... things I can't tell you.\nSuperHot is something that has to be experienced first hand.\nWhat you see and do is not going to be the same as you would think you would do.\nThe cool thing about SuperHot is you don't realize there is a deeper story unless you dig for it.\nYes SuperHot has shooting, it has time based movement,\nit has puzzles, semi-hacking and unique graphics that are freaky mixture of ASCII text and modern-gen effects.\nSuperHot can be brutally difficult at times as well.\nOther times, it can seem to easy. Once you learn the best way to attack, some weapons can feel too overpowered while others are pretty worthless.\nThe AI will run you down and will fire off that fatal shot just one micro-second before you were going to blast that red dude down with some buckshot.\nIn fairness I can not fully review this game, because doing so would give too much of the experience away.\nIf you like shooters mixed with cool retro vibe and some conspiracy theory mixed in, SuperHot should be right up your alley.\nThe game is very polished, runs great and is a pleasure to play.\nThis is a thinking person's game though.\nDon't expect to charge head on to the enemy blasting away. You have to pick your moments of attack, all the while keeping your head on a 360 degree swivel for that sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that will come up behind you.\nUsually if you hear a gunshot from a new direction that you are unaware of, you are already dead. The difficulty is fair as can be though. Nothing happens in the world until you move.\nBad guy standing right in front of you with a machine gun?\nHe will not move or fire an inch until you do (Well, he will but very, very slowly).\nThis gives you tactical time to think of the best course of action.\nMoving quickly will only get you killed faster. Take your time and think out your options. Sometimes the best option is a punch to the face.\nHere is an example of a level:\nI start out with no weapons. A man is in front of me with a baseball bat. He is very, very slowly running toward me.\nI wait until he is in reach and punch him. As he is knocked back I grab the baseball bat that gets thrown from his grip.\nSpinning around I see another guy with his bat halfway through the arc to bash in my brains, I gut him with my bat and continue spinning around to the first guy who is starting to recover from my punch.\nI smash him in the head and move forward.\nNow I see a guy coming down a hallway with a pistol. He runs toward me as I dart between pillars. When he comes around the corner to shoot at me I smash his hand with my bat and grab his gun from the air while tossing my bat at his face.\nI spin around again and pop a shot into the knees of the other bat boy who was right behind me. I hear a boom and see red tracers flying through the air at the spot I was just 1 second ago.\nAnother unseen doorway had opened with another guy with a shotgun. I raise my gun up and fire off a round but by the time the bullet reaches him he has already moved in another direction.\nGot him now... click... click... click. No!, my gun is empty!\nHe is only 4 feet from me now and is raising the shotgun up to eye level.\nI panic and throw the pistol at him.\nThe pistol hits him just as he fires.\nThe bullets from his shotgun are too close for me to dodge and I go down at the same time screaming NOOOOOO!\nSUPERHOT!\nIf that doesn't get your blood pumping, then you need to have your pulse checked.\n\nSuperHot - 7 out of 10 Total\n\nGraphics:	8 / 10\nGraphically this game looks good for what it is.\nThere are basically three colors in the world.\nWhite, Red and Black. However, the way the graphics are presented\nand the smooth framerate more than make up for more realistic looking graphics.\n\nGameplay:	  7.5 / 10\nGunplay is pretty solid, other than the annoyance of waiting for the next bullet in the clip to be ready (my biggest gaming gripe about this game), but I see why they did it from a gameplay point of view. Katanas feel especially powerful, with being able to cut a guy in half with one swipe and even chop bullets in half mid-flight.\n\nStory:  7 / 10\nThe story as such starts out typical of a guy being excited for a new game and slowly ratchets up to something unexpected and different. While not the most engaging story (not any character development, drama or comedy), this story is all about mystery and excitement and does a fine job with just that.\n\nAudio:  8 / 10\nDoes the job. Nothing amazing but no problems either.\n\nPC Options:  6 / 10\nNo real options other than default stuff like resolution, Windowed mode and 2 or 3 small things. Would have liked to see some neat features like different color shaders and the like.\n\nPrice:  6 / 10\nThe price at release is the biggest problem I have.\nThe game is good. The game does what it says on the tin.\nHowever, the lack of variety of gameplay and rather short story mode really bring this score down. If it was $15 rather than $25 I would have no issues with the price.\n\nFinal Word:\nWhile SuperHot's main story mode is rather short,  it makes up for it with extra modes like Endless Mode and Challenges that open up after the main game finishes. If you are looking for an interesting take on a bad guy vs good guy shooter without a lot of dialogue or missions, other than to kill the red guys, then SuperHot might be worth checking out.\nIf you can wait for a sale, I would wait for the $15 to $20 price point. If you follow my twitter @jdwohlever message me and I'll send you a coupon code for 15% off while supplies last.","March 2","true","4.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","1"

It's more of puzzle game than a FPS though because you need to have patience to plan your movements. If you rush in, you will likely die. When you stop moving, time nearly haults as well. You can use this time manipulation to dodge bullets, narrowly avoiding death as you destroy all of the enemies in each level. Throw weapons or various objects to block bullets and disarm your enemies, hot switch to change places with one of your enemies, leaving them to die instead of you.\n\nPlease check out my Quick Review Video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ViYBuzR0ac\nPros:\n-interesting and intriguing story (it took me about 3.5 hours for the main story)\n-awesome, fun, and unique gameplay\n-lots of content after the main story (different challenges, time trials, endless modes)\n-easy to upload and share your replays to Superhot's killstagram.com right in the game\n\nCons:\n-not a whole lot of menu options (lacks fullscreen windows, controls)\n-SUPER HOT repeating voice gets annoying after each level\n\nOverall, the story was well done, and the gameplay was very enjoyable. This game has a lot to offer, and you can pull off some really crazy plays. If you enjoy challenge modes, timed modes, and/or endless modes, this game is certainly worth the full price. However, if you intend to play ONLY the main story, I suggest waiting for a sale.","February 26","true","6.3"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/calipanhead/recommended/322500/","calipanhead","H.I. McDunnough","http://steamcommunity.com/id/calipanhead/","613 products in account","Edit and clarification below\n\nThe day has finally come, I backed this game back on Kickstarter close to 3 years ago and\n\nIT'S HERE\n\nI have been eagerly anticipating the release of this game forever and BOY does it deliver.  First things first, don't go into SUPERHOT expecting a lengthy and "mind blowing" story.  I have seen quite a few reviews from people criticizing the game because "the story is 2 hours".   I for one love the short story, it has a Cronenberg "Videodrome" vibe (especially when you hunt for the numerous secrets).  After finishing the campaign you unlock tons of endless and challenge modes as well as hidden secrets within all the levels. This is where the meat of the game lies.  There are also a handful of mini games in the menu that are quite entertaining.  If you have seen any gameplay you know what to expect.  This IS a "one trick pony" as they say.  However, this one trick is executed with  perfection .  The aesthetic of this game is just gorgeous, the sound design is superb, the art style is crisp and clean, the DOS era theme of the game menus is very polished, and the controls are as tight as can be.  "Killstagram" is also a really sweet and unique feature.  You can seamlessly upload replays in game to https://killstagram.com/ to be shared on social media.  All in all this is a fantastic game, I am a big fan of endless games and I will be putting many of hours into this.  Easily one of my favorite FPS games.\n\nBODIES ARE DISPOSABLE\n\nGIVE US NAMES\n\nGIVE US YOUR FRIENDS\n\nWE NEED MORE\n\nOBEY\n\nSUPER\nHOT\nSUPER\nHOT\nSUPER\nHOT\nSUPER\nHOT\n\nEDIT: Right, alot of downvotes because I am not bashing the game with an ignorant and/or snarky three sentence review.  Let me clarify, I could care less whether or not you like the game. However, it is common knowledge that the game is a score attack/mechanic driven game. So, when you buy and then write a "wtf 2 hours for 25 dollars!1!1" negative review you are making yourself look like a fool, and  perpetuating a fallacy.  I agree SUPERHOT isn't for everyone. As I stated before, complaining the story wasn't long enough\n\nAFTER FULLY KNOWING IT IS AIMED AT ENDLESS AND CHALLENGE MODES\n\nis utterly absurd.\n\nSUPERHOT was funded for the SOLE purpose of having tons of endless and challenge modes. If people bashing the game bothered to research before purchasing they would have known this. If you even did a quarter of the challenges available you would get your moneys worth. Criticizing a game for what it isn't trying to be is the very definition of entitlement. I legitimately haven't seen a vaild criticism of the game yet besides "hurr durr it's 2 hours".  Look at the description, it doesn't even mention a campaign. This game is probably one of the best to come from crowdfunding, it delivered EXACTLY what the backers wanted.\n\nAt the end of the day whether or not it is worth the price is dependent on what you think of the time slowing mechanic. If you saw the mechanic and went "meh" you will be bored probably within three hours. If you were fascinated by a revolutionary step in an otherwise stagnant FPS genre seeing thousands of opportunities, you will be occupied for HOURS.\n\n\nEDIT 2: I have never been one to take Steam reviews as the gospel.  Especially now after seeing all the negative 2 sentence snarky reviews getting thrust to the top of the SUPERHOT page.  I am very glad that the critical reception has been very positive.  However, in the user Steam reviews I have seen a vocal minority insulting the dev's artistic vision, questioning their character, even going as far as to call them "disingenuous" (shout out to  Lethargy.)  Frankly, it is really childish to me to hate a game just because it wasn't what you expected.  I wish the team the best of luck and I hope they make enough cash to embark on another endeavor, they deserve it.","February 25","true","62.6"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","11","21","2","9"

Anyone who says it's just a 2 hour game doesn't realize that the other modes can make this game even longer. Eventually you get bored with anygame, but I feel like I could play this game for a little while when I get bored with other games.\n\nIn terms of price, sure it's a little pricey, but honestly you are spending money for a great game. If you can't do that, then just wait until a sale or something and quit flooding the steam forums and reviews with pointless complaining about the price.\n\nTL:DR It's a great game.

You always feel like you're in a movie with SUPERHOT, a movie which is well worth the "Watch".\n\nThe vast additions since the prototype are only good, and the replayability continues to the full game (I may or may not have played the prototype 8 times).\n\nGive the game a go.

Instantly I thought it looked very interesting and fun. Now that the game is released and modestly fleshed out, I have to admit, I LOVE it!!\n\nSo the main mechanic is the speed of time. When you are not moving, it moves SUPER slow. When you look around, it speeds up a little. Finally, when you move, it goes into normal speed. Your object is to kill the enemies utilising these mechanics without eating a bullet, fist or blade first. It sounds simple but it is almost like a puzzle game at times when you need to figure out the order of your actions otherwise you die. You can punch dudes, grab their guns and shoot them in the head and then throw the empty gun at someone to stun them, allowing you to move in for the kill. It's great fun and SUPER satisfying.\n\nThe "story" is not too long and seems to be the main complaint amongst folk. Depending on your skill level, it can be done within a few hours. However, the game then has challenge modes which have certain criteria such as running through the levels again allowing throwing items only, punching only, one bullet per gun as well as altering the look of the game. I've put about 8 hours in so far and that includes finishing the story and completing about 1/3 of the challenges. I think the price tag is a bit much for the content provided, I believe £10-£12 would be a fairer price point.\n\nAside from the price, I would recommend this to anyone. It's really fun, interesting and satisfying to play. It even includes an endless mode, so there is still stuff to do after the story and challenges. It did not let me down and in fact surpassed my expectations, I only wish it lasted longer.\n\nBuy it.","April 17","true","9.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game includes extremely enjoyable challenges which I will be working through for the next few days. There is an endless mode, for all the times i'm bored of all my other games, and the story levels are easily replayable.\n\nThe best part of SUPERHOT is the satisfaction of creating a chain of death, whether that be a mix of matrix-style bullet dodgin' or with firing shotguns and throwing pistols. You always feel like you're in a movie with SUPERHOT, a movie which is well worth the "Watch".\n\nThe vast additions since the prototype are only good, and the replayability continues to the full game (I may or may not have played the prototype 8 times).\n\nGive the game a go. You won't regret it, even if you only get 6hours out of it.\nAnd be sure to check out the challenges!\n\nSUPERHOT IS THE MOST INNOVATIVE SHOOTER I'VE EVER PLAYED! xD","February 28","true","8.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"
