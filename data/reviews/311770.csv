It's no different to other Lego games in its mechanics - smash stuff to collect studs with which to buy other characters and such. Hidden throughout levels are minikits, same as every other game. What makes this one different for me is the fighting. In other Lego games it's kinda a case of "mash the attack button until you win," but in this one you can time it so you can block as well, and there's sometimes a nice back and forth which gives it a really fun swashbuckling feel, as you'd expect and hope for in a pirate game.\n\nThe style of narrative is the same as other games too, told in a slapstick silent-movie style. This really helps to explain the third and fourth movies to me, since I couldn't follow them at all compared to the first two. Also there are no forced speeches to break up the flow ^.^\n\nSo if you like Lego games as a concept, you'll probably enjoy this. The music is great, the combat is fun, the levels are well designed and fun to smash through.. I just really like this game ^.^","December 7, 2014","true","7.1"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","31","32","0","1"

The graphics have improved a lot, the cutscenes are longer and actually have much more entertaining humor, plus they are more relevant to the movies. In the beginning, I was skeptical since the first few missions aren't that great and the formatting seemed a little different, but once I got into it, it quickly became very entertaining.  I have never encountered any technical problems or bugs whatsoever, so I would be skeptical about believing some of the other, more negative reviews in that regard. All in all, I'd give it an 8.5/10. I highly recommend this game and think it has made some very good changes from past games such as the new sword combat, but the only real negatives I can think of are the fact that they cut vehicle missions and that there are only 5 levels per movie instead of 6.","December 31, 2014","true","23.5"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","4"

LEGO® Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game takes some of my favorite movie content and applies it to the fun formula that is used in these types of games.\n\nSo is it worth it? Well yes, but if you're as big a fan of the POTC series as I am, you might find yourself a bit dissappointed. My biggest dissappointment with the game was the lack of Hans Zimmer's great score, which is an essential part of the success of the movies. You'll find many recognizable tracks such as "Jack Sparrow" and "The Kraken" but much of the score is missing and instead is replaced with mediocre music that doesn't compliment Zimmer's score. Why? Well I have two guesses:\n\n1. The creators of the game did not believe the music would fit with the pace of the levels they designed. If this is true, I completely disagree with their decision.\n\n2.  Because the game is using Disney intellectual property, obtaining the rights to the music was expensive for Travller's Tales. I find this the more probable case.\n\n\n\nMy other problem with the game is that it's buggy. I haven't experienced the crashes that other people have, but I have encountered annoying bugs. The most annoying takes place on the last level, where an event doesn't take place as it's supposed to and you're pretty much stuck. The only way to beat the level is to restart and go through the whole thing, hoping it doesn't bug out again. I've encountered this bug on both the PC and console versions.\n\n\nSo would I recommend the game? Well despite the minor bugs and the lack of Zimmer's score, I would say yes. It's a fun game that uses familiar lego mechanics and captures the spirit of the movies. If you're a fan of TT lego games or the POTC movies, you'll probably enjoy this game.\n","December 24, 2014","true","5.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

On my Xbox, I thnk I have a good 90% of all the Lego Games. Some I like more than others and this is one I had to have on my PC, thtough Steam, as well. Mostly because there are 3 of us sharing the Xbox and I don't get as much game time there as I do on my PC.\n\nThis game is great. Per all the Lego game - "SMASH ALL THE THINGS!" - which is always fun. The fact they made Jack actaully stagger and act drunk, like in the movies, is truly amazing. He can be hard to control but you get used to it and it is a detail many gaming companies would have skipped.\n\nThe controls, for me being used to the Xbox, are a bit difficult. Trying to get characters to move in a diagonal direction with just straight arrow keys is tough. I had to abandone the game for awhile becuase I got frustrated at one point, but am willing to give it another try. The new Steam Machines come with a controller but I don't know if that will help with these older games.\n\nAnyway, Lego Pirates is probably my favorite of the Lego games and I will play it again and again and again.\n\nI highly recommend this one.","September 20, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It tells the tale which spans accross the entire franchise (at the date writing this review) in a fun, cheeky and childish way which is friendly to everybody.\n\nIt features the same engine and core mechanics as many other LEGO titles in the series, but it is obviously a much earlier version. It lacks the story telling components introduced in later releases and it does depend on the user to know the story well before actually playing. It attempts to present itself in a way which does sufficiently tell the story, but without prior knowledge it still has unfinished links in this translation.\n\nThere are various bugs in this game which are both infuriating and game-breaking. Quite often you'll be able to jump into a spot with no way of escaping other than restarting the game, and some technical issues causing crashes. Limiting the framefrate to less than 60 seems to fix those problems though. On top of all the problems with this game, I really enjoyed the franchise specific animations and the swordplay mechanics, especially later in teh game.\n\nOverall it's a great game which you can have a lot of fun with the franchise and LEGO. If you're able to iron out the frustrating parts, it's definitely worth the time and I would recommend it.","July 5, 2015","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
