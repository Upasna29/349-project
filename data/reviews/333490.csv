For the record I'm absolutely terrible at puzzles, but I actually enjoy the game. The puzzle involve you controlling multiple character where you need to move a to a certain point, activate switches at correct timings, and get to your character icon.\nAfter that, you rewind the tape, select the other character and play in tandem with the recording to match up levels, buttons, and jumping over hurdles to try and make it to the end.\n\nIt's extremely well made, and can easily mess up if you had your timings off, even by half a second. Even more so since as the levels progress more and more classic platforming dangers appear. Simple spikes, easily avoided in most games become a difficult obstacle as you need to help create a platform to jump with one character, rewind and then manoeuvre the other across it all.\n\nNeko, did a splendid job on the game, and can appreciate the time and effort they put into it all. I enjoy the game, even though it takes me far far too long to complete what others would solve in possible tens of seconds.\n\nYou should get the game? Do you like platforming, and puzzles with an interesting mechanics? If so, yes.\n\nPC Gameplay\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tXJuw4EoJk","July 9, 2015","true","2.2"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","23","27","0","0"

Well, that you can do in this twisted puzzle/platformer. The basic idea is simple, you must play out each characters action and cohesively accomplish a goal. Rather that be fighting a giant squid, conquering a laser grid, or just simply getting to a higher platform. It's far from easy, as some levels require a grasp of precognition and postcognition that would make a Jedi blush. The fun part of Replay is experimentation, that "Aha!" moment and feeling that comes along with it as you solve a rather difficult puzzle. On top of all that there is plenty of challenge here with bonus goodies, side objectives, bosses, and pretty awesome pixel work. The only downside to Replay is that it's origins are in the mobile market and this shows. From the menus, bugs, resolution, and 3 tiered achievement levels, Replay wears its heart on the sleeve for better or worse. The good far outweighs the bad though, and this game is sure to delight any puzzle lovers. The graphics are charming, the story is cute, and the puzzles clever in design. Just be prepared to rewind a million times!\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/rX7HJR4aJyk\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","October 18, 2015","true","1.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

However, it was ruined by the fact that rewinding meant that it went back to the very beginning and I had to repeat ALL of the actions I'd done up to that point.\n\nI really wish that we could've had the capability to rewind to a given point in the timeline, not just the beginning. Either way, I still played the game, but it lost fun along the way as events got longer, more confusing, and required more forced repetition which you could easily mess up.","February 14","false","13.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You can rewind the restart and try to do a characters actions again if they don't match up right. Its all about planning, TIMING and strategies. Basic but fun game that is thought provoking.\n\nLots of levels and gets fairly challenging to not just complete each level but collect the keys and objectives ASAP. If you liked Briad (or strategy and even Portal type games, while different it gets you to think and plan), you will likely like this even more since its more involved.","November 28, 2015","true","5.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
